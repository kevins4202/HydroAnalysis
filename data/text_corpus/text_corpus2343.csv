11715,alluvial aquifers are one of the most exploited and easily accessible aquifer networks across the world as they coincide with regions of intensive human settlements over the years improper management and overexploitation of groundwater has severely stressed the natural replenishing capacity of these aquifer systems identification of potential artificial recharge networks and their monitoring are urgently needed for long term sustainable groundwater management in this study an efficient and cost effective strategy to locate prospective groundwater recharge zones is devised by integrating electrical resistivity tomography ert sediment characterization and temporal monitoring techniques the efficacy of the above strategy is evaluated in the central part of indo gangetic basin igb correlation of 2 d ert models with borehole lithology and depth wise variation of hydraulic parameters deciphered the existence of prospective regions composed of highly permeable strata within 6 48 m depth in addition the behavior of the delineated prospective regions was monitored by applying time lapse ert study the comparison of time lapse 2 d ert models highlighted a significant reduction in post monsoon resistivity profiles suggesting an increase in saturation levels due to infiltration of rainwater this study provides an integrated cost effective approach for identification of prospective artificial recharge sites and monitoring their efficacy in replenishing shallow aquifers thereby enabling sustainable groundwater management graphical abstract image 1 keywords alluvial aquifer indo gangetic basin groundwater artificial recharge ert time lapse data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction overexploitation and poor management of groundwater resources are causing rapid depletion of groundwater in alluvial aquifers globally as reported by numerous studies in the last few decades aeschbach hertig and gleeson 2012 bonsor et al 2017 macdonald et al 2015 shah et al 2009 shamsudduha et al 2011 these aquifer systems are mostly exploited due to ease of accessibility and widespread presence margat and van der gun 2013 at the same time the natural groundwater recharge processes in these aquifer systems have been severely impacted due to rapid urbanization increase in population and anthropogenic activities thereby creating an imbalance between the rate of recharge and abstraction of groundwater jha and sinha 2009 sharma et al 2010 alluvial aquifer systems of the indo gangetic basin igb form one of the most important groundwater reservoirs of the world and suffer the same fate the igb spans across the vast stretches of south asian countries like pakistan india nepal and bangladesh which are the largest consumers of groundwater for irrigation and household needs shah et al 2006 shamsudduha et al 2011 sharma et al 2010 approximately 25 of global groundwater abstraction happens from these alluvium systems through 15 20 million boreholes wada et al 2010 which has severely stressed this groundwater network therefore identification of prospective locations for developing networks of artificial recharge wells is crucial for sustainable groundwater management in these groundwater depleted regions the conventional approaches such as undisturbed sediment sampling infiltration test and pumping tests are traditionally used to identify the prospective artificial recharge zones but they are expensive and time consuming practices especially for the low to middle income countries mcinnis et al 2013 in addition these techniques are spatially constrained due to lack of wide data coverage which makes the regional scale interpretation more challenging however these limitations could be overcome by using geophysical methods among the various geophysical methods geoelectrical methods such as electrical resistivity tomography ert and vertical electrical sounding ves are particularly well suited for groundwater exploration because of their ability to delineate saturated and unsaturated zones with contrasting resistivities loke and barker 1996 apart from relatively low resistivity a potential groundwater storage zone is often associated with high hydraulic conductivity and transmissivity an accurate estimate of such hydraulic parameters plays an important role in understanding the storage capacity and flow of groundwater in an aquifer dor et al 2011 these parameters can be estimated by various methods such as in situ pumping test parallel drain laboratory based direct measurements constant head falling head and pore size distribution and laboratory based correlation grain size distribution oosterbaan and nijland 1994 the estimates of hydraulic parameters are constrained by discreteness of data sampling shape of particle pore distribution and particle packing freeze and cherry 1979 oosterbaan and nijland 1994 although the in situ methods provide finely discretized data the methods are expensive and time consuming whereas the laboratory based direct methods require collection of undisturbed sample core which is difficult to achieve while collecting water saturated sediments given these limitations the grain size distribution method using disturbed sediment samples is widely used to calculate hydraulic conductivity lu et al 2012 riva et al 2014 song et al 2009 vienken and dietrich 2011 from empirical formulae such as kozney carman and beyer equations beyer 1964 freeze and cherry 1979 recently a modified empirical equation developed by wang et al 2017 from a large dataset of rosas et al 2014 was shown to provide a more accurate prediction of hydraulic conductivity from grain size distribution data in some of the studies soupios et al 2007 vogelgesang et al 2020 an empirical relationship between the resistivity parameters obtained from the geoelectrical methods and the hydraulic parameters obtained from the correlation method was developed for a particular region where adequate number of boreholes were available afterwards the established empirical relationship was interpolated to estimate the hydraulic parameters of a region where borehole information was not available combination of hydraulic conductivity and transmissivity estimates from grain size distribution and ert can be a cost effective and rapid method to determine aquifer properties and locate potential recharge zones again monitoring of the temporal variation of subsurface resistivity especially pre and post monsoon is important to determine the seasonal variability in the identified artificial recharge sites it provides a comprehensive understanding of the migration channels and their connectivity with deeper zones it also provides a way to validate the findings of the conventional approaches as obtained from the discrete measurements as a result the use of ert study and time lapse ert monitoring have now become a common practice in countries facing groundwater scarcity arora and ahmed 2011 descloitres et al 2008 göktürkler et al 2008 hasan et al 2019 mojica et al 2013 nazaruddin et al 2017 saad et al 2017 tesfaldet and puttiwongrak 2019 wubda et al 2017 a few researchers have used geoelectrical methods for groundwater exploration along the indo gangetic plains kumar et al 2014 majumdar and pal 2005 however these methods particularly resistivity methods were rarely focused on identification of suitable groundwater recharge sites such as in the central alluvial plains of igb specially a time lapse ert study for monitoring the effectiveness of proposed artificial recharge sites is not available in this region therefore an integrated investigation using ert sediment characterization and temporal monitoring by time lapse ert data was performed as a case study at iit kanpur campus in the central part of igb to fulfill the following objectives a to identify potential artificial recharge sites in a typical alluvial setting and correlate these sites with their lithology b to estimate the hydraulic parameters from the sediment samples collected and analyze the variation in these parameters with depth c to monitor the seasonal variability i e pre and post monsoon of aquifer recharge using an innovative normalized resistivity ratio nrr approach to further validate the findings of the study 2 study area the present study area iit kanpur is located in kanpur nagar district of eastern uttar pradesh india fig 1 iit kanpur is situated over an area of 1000 acres and hosts 23 departments having 10 000 students staff and faculty members it is a fully residential campus with several amenities that use groundwater extensively such as laboratories hostels schools and sports facilities grounds and swimming pool etc the water demands of the campus since its establishment are met through several deep tube wells dtw at a depth of 350 400 m below ground level bgl and a few shallow tube wells stw at a depth of 250 m bgl personal communication from institute works department iwd section iit kanpur 2 1 geology the study site is a part of the vast ganges plains of igb fig 1 the area is mostly covered by quaternary age alluvium sediments as eroded from the himalayas and redistributed by river ganges and its tributaries the dominant lithology comprises gravel sand silt and clay overlain the basement of archean bundelkhand granite singh et al 2009 srivastava et al 2013 the maximum thickness of the alluvium sediments is reported to be 500 m in the study area the alluvial sediments are further categorized into older alluvium deposited along the central part of igb during lower to upper pleistocene period and newer alluvium deposited along the course of the river during upper pleistocene to recent period singh 1996 2 2 geomorphology the kanpur district exhibits a relatively flat topography with the master slope aligned from north west to south east direction with an average elevation of the land surface of 125 m above mean sea level two rivers the ganga and the pandu drain through the area singh et al 2009 sinha et al 2005 geo morphologically the city is divided into two groups i lowlands or younger alluvial plains bangar and ii uplands or older alluvial plain khadar singh 1996 the lowlands are flat to gently sloping and have a large area of undulating terrain formed by river deposition paleo channels meander scar and oxbow lakes are some of the common fluvial landforms present srivastava and singh 1999 the uplands area is somewhat stable with the highest topography of the region mostly formed by extensive deposition of older alluvium singh 1996 in addition salt encrustation patches have been reported from few locations which suggest the presence of shallow water tables sinha et al 2002 2005 2 3 hydrogeology aquifer system in kanpur district has been divided into three major groups shallow middle and deep aquifers singh et al 2006 groundwater in shallow aquifer i e up to 50 m bgl occurs under unconfined to semi unconfined conditions and this zone is the primary source of potable water to tube wells dug wells and is thereby prone to over exploitation in the middle aquifer i e 90 240 m bgl groundwater occurs in confined conditions the presence of overlying and underlying clay beds has restricted its usage as an effective groundwater source the deep aquifer lies between 180 and 450 m bgl and has good yielding capacity groundwater in this zone occurs under confined conditions and is exploited to a lesser extent singh et al 2006 3 methodology 3 1 resistivity survey and data analysis to identify potential recharge sites geophysical data sets were acquired using electrical resistivity tomography ert technique at ten locations profiles p1 p10 inside iit kanpur premises between october 2018 to february 2020 fig 1 survey sites were selected at different parts of the campus for wider coverage of the study area and to ensure that at least 230 m of length was available to conduct the survey i e after avoiding buildings dense bushes electrical and gas pipelines this minimum length was necessary to obtain a depth section in the range of 45 60 m in each region at p5 and p8 locations the surveys were conducted in june 2019 and repeated in january 2020 time lapse ert surveys to monitor the temporal variability by keeping the data acquisition parameters the same 3 1 1 data acquisition ert data were acquired using syscal r1 plus iris instruments france resistivity meter with 72 stainless steel electrodes figure s1a b the electrodes were laid along a straight line at a constant spacing a between two electrodes figure s1c d electrodes were connected to the resistivity meter via multi core cables each of 120 m length for each measurement a predefined computer program automatically selects two electrode pairs one pair each for current and potential at a time based on various input parameters such as type of array number of electrodes electrode spacing voltage applied etc datasets were acquired using hybrid wenner schlumberger array which is moderately sensitive to both lateral and vertical subsurface resistivity variations bichet et al 2016 loke 2001 detailed survey parameters of all the profiles are given in table 1 data along all the profiles were acquired with 500 ms current injection time per cycle output voltage of 400 v maximum and minimum numbers of stacking as 16 and 4 respectively and a maximum admitted error of 5 3 1 2 data processing and modelling pre processing of the acquired raw data was performed to remove the inconsistent erroneous and spiky data thereby to avoid propagation of such errors in the results often such noisy data appear due to loose contact filled up material and presence of subsurface utilities loke 2001 after data filtration the measured apparent resistivity contours were plotted in the form of 2 d pseudo depth sections which approximately represent the subsurface resistivity distribution fig 2 a next by inverting the measured apparent resistivity data the true distribution of subsurface resistivity variation was obtained arora and ahmed 2011 in this work the inverse modelling was performed using the res2dinv software wherein a 2d resistivity model was first determined using the distribution of data in the pseudo section i e the data in the measured apparent resistivity contours subsequently by employing the finite difference modelling scheme the apparent resistivity values were calculated for the above resistivity model and the calculated apparent resistivity contours were plotted by the software loke 2001 fig 2b further a smoothness constrained least squares optimization technique ellis and oldenburg 1994 loke and barker 1996 was utilized for minimizing the misfit between the measured and calculated apparent resistivity values iteratively herein the misfit was calculated in terms of root mean square error rmse finally the resistivity model that corresponded to the least rmse was considered as the best fit 2 d resistivity model fig 2c for the measured apparent resistivity values 3 1 3 estimation of normalized resistivity ratio nrr for the time lapse ert model comparison of 2 d resistivity sections using same color code helps in delineating subsurface regions of similar resistivity variation over an area bichet et al 2016 mishra et al 2019 such an approach also works well for time lapse 2 d resistivity sections in delineating the subsurface regions that have undergone seasonal resistivity changes when no changes in geology are assumed however this color code approach is only qualitative in nature and fails to quantify the resistivity changes that help in finding regions with maximum resistivity variation in this study an innovative approach to get optimal visualization of the changes in the time lapse resistivity sections has been presented through the computation of normalized resistivity ratio nrr the percentage of nrr was calculated from the pre march may and post october february monsoon resistivity values as obtained from the inverse models of the respective time lapse dataset using the formula given below 1 n r r ρ p o s t ρ p r e ρ p o s t ρ p r e 100 where ρ p o s t and ρ p r e refer to post and pre monsoon resistivity values respectively the nrr approach is based on the well established index ratios such as normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and normalized burn ratio nbr that are used as indicators to enhance certain characteristic features in remote sensing measurements escuin et al 2008 the negative values highlight the regions with reduced resistivity values whereas the positive values highlight the regions with increased resistivity values zero indicates the regions with no changes between the resistivity values of pre and post monsoon periods 2 d resistivity models were segregated into four regions i e central to eastern northern southern and eastern based on the locations of the profiles in the study area the profiles falling under the same region were presented with a uniform color code also the time lapse resistivity sections from the two locations i e p5 and p8 were compared by keeping uniform color code and using the plots of percentage nrr values 3 2 sediment sampling characterization and preparation of litholog three lithologs one existing and other two prepared during this study were analyzed in this study to get an overview of the major sediment types present in the study area figs 1 and 3 the lithology from a location b1 near railway line fig 1 was previously prepared by iwd iit kanpur additionally new aquifer sediments were collected from two locations hockey ground b2 and main gate b3 inside iit kanpur campus fig 1 using water boring in this process water was constantly pumped into the bore to loosen the sediment while the borewell was drilled simultaneously using a drill bit figure s2 the sediments were withdrawn through a pipe and were collected in a pan excess water was discarded from the pan and the sediments were transferred and stored in clean polythene ziplock bags samples were collected at every 3 m up to 40 m below the surface fig 3 the texture and grain size distribution of collected sediments was determined using a combination of sieve and hydrometer analyses bis 1994 sodium hexametaphosphate was used as a dispersant in hydrometer analysis for each sediment sample a grain size distribution was generated by plotting mass percent finer with respect to particle diameter on a log scale sheet 1 and sheet 2 of electronic annexure xls sediment properties such as d 60 diameter at which 60 particles are finer and d 10 diameter at which 10 particles are finer were determined from the grain size distribution plots sheet 3 of electronic annexure xls wang et al 2017 provided an empirical formula to calculate hydraulic conductivity from the grain size distribution data provided the dataset met the following criteria d 60 0 09 4 29 m m d 10 0 05 0 83 m m u 1 3 18 3 where d 60 is the diameter at which 60 particles are finer d 10 is the diameter at which 10 particles are finer and u is coefficient of uniformity d 60 d 10 as d 60 d 10 and u values determined for sediment samples collected in this study met the above criteria details in sheet 3 of electronic annexure xls the hydraulic conductivity for each sediment sample was calculated using the empirical relation eq 2 given by wang et al 2017 2 k w c w g v log g ⅆ 60 3 v 2 1 d e 2 where k w denotes hydraulic conductivity m d 1 c w is wang sorting coefficient 2 9 10 3 g is acceleration due to gravity 9 81 m s 2 ʋ is kinematic viscosity of water 8 9 10 7 m2 s 1 at 25 c and d e is effective diameter m same as d 10 here k w was estimated under the assumption of an isotropic symmetric medium a constant k w value was calculated for each 3 m layer the use of grain size distribution of disturbed sediments for calculation of hydraulic conductivity provides only an approximate estimate because particle packing in the aquifer is a major factor in determining hydraulic properties freeze and cherry 1979 oosterbaan and nijland 1994 however this method is time efficient cost effective and can be performed on disturbed sediments that are easier to collect from water saturated aquifers transmissivity t m2 d 1 of the shallow aquifers was calculated from the hydraulic conductivity of each sampled sediment profile k wi using the expression below 3 t i 1 n k w i d where d represents the depth of each sampled sediment profile 3 m and n represents the number of depth profiles sampled in the aquifer between two clay layers 3 2 1 a typical calculation of hydraulic conductivity k and transmissivity t at location b2 the hydraulic conductivity k and transmissivity t were calculated based on the grain size distribution for the sediment sample of 24 27 m depth that satisfy the criteria mentioned by wang et al 2017 the d 60 d 10 and u values for this sediment samples were as follows d 60 0 000276 m d 10 d e 0 000063 m and u d 60 d 10 4 38 applying the empirical formula eq 2 the hydraulic conductivity was computed as follows k w c w g v log g ⅆ 60 3 v 2 1 d e 2 2 9 10 3 9 81 8 9 10 7 log 9 81 2 76 10 4 3 8 9 10 7 2 1 6 3 10 5 2 4 527 m d 1 given that at b2 the aquifer lies between 6 m to 27 m below the surface positioned between two clay layers the overall transmissivity t m2 d 1 of this aquifer can be calculated from summation of products of hydraulic conductivities and depths in this case every 3 m of each layer eq 3 so the t for the 6 27 m aquifer was calculated as follows t i 1 n k w i d 4 083 2 766 4 103 4 129 4 305 2 917 4 527 3 80 5 m 2 d 1 hydraulic conductivities and transmissivity values of other layers and aquifers were calculated and are shown in sheets 2 and 3 of the electronic annexure xls file finally the lithology charts of the bore wells b1 b3 were correlated with the corresponding 2 d resistivity sections and with the estimated hydraulic parameters 4 results and discussion 4 1 distribution of the layers and resistivity variations 4 1 1 central to eastern region the 2 d resistivity sections of the profiles p1 and p2 revealed a three layer configuration with a maximum resistivity value of 350 ohm m fig 4 a and b along the length of profile p1 fig 4a a moderately resistive 18 50 ohm m top layer with a thickness of 10 15 m was identified which was mostly continuous except for a few breaks in the form of low resistive 18 ohm m channels between 20 45 m and between 90 130 m distances from the origin of the profile fig 4a further these channels were connected with a low resistive second layer whose thickness increased from 20 m close to the origin of the profile to 50 m towards the end of the profile a moderately resistive third layer was observed at 35 m below the surface at 80 m from the origin and goes till the bottom of the section before ending at 190 m from the origin in profile p2 fig 4b a moderately resistive top layer was also observed with few breaks in the form of low resistive zones between 20 30 m 90 220 m and 300 350 m from the origin however the thickness of the layer varied between 15 and 20 m similar to p1 a low resistive second layer was observed at 15 m below the surface which continued up to 80 90 m depth the thickness of this layer was 60 m between 80 and 290 m from the origin of the profile but the thickness decreased to 35 m between 290 and 340 m however the thickness again increased to 80 m after 340 m from the origin a low resistive channel like feature from the second layer to the deeper layer was observed between 400 and 460 m from the origin another moderately resistive layer was observed below the second layer from a depth of 75 m in the resistivity section between 220 and 370 m from the origin and squeezing up to 50 m below surface between 310 and 370 m distance from the origin after 80 90 m depth a highly resistive 50 ohm m layer was observed between 270 and 365 m from the origin a comparison with the lithological information obtained from the borewell b1 near the profile p1 figs 1 3 and 4c and table 2 indicated that the topmost layer up to 10 m depth with moderate resistivity values consisted of highly unsaturated surface soil occasionally mixed with clay strata a low resistive layer was found at 10 m depth below surface till a depth of 50 55 m between 10 and 330 m from the origin of profile p1 likewise a continuous second layer up to 60 70 m depth below surface along p2 were mainly composed of fine sand with variable saturation levels the layer below that was mostly composed of clay and hard clay which resulted in a highly resistive layer beyond the 80 m depth between 320 and 360 m from the origin overall the second layer of 40 60 m thickness with variable water saturation composed of fine sand and could be a potential storage site of shallow groundwater which can be utilized for groundwater abstraction and recharging in this region 4 1 2 northern region the three layer resistivity configuration as identified for profiles p1 and p2 was also observed along the profile p3 fig 5 a the top layer 10 m thick consisted of four zones a moderately resistive zone 13 50 ohm m up to 80 m distance a highly resistive zone 50 ohm m between 85 and 180 m and two moderate resistive zones at approximately 180 210 m and 300 m respectively from the origin of the profile the moderately resistive zone was dipping downward and mixing with the second layer at 290 m distance from the origin a low resistive second layer with resistivity 13 ohm m was observed below the top layer and extending up to 30 35 m depth from the surface at around 190 220 m distance from origin a vertical low resistive channel from the second layer extends downward into the moderate resistive patches of the third layer and reaches till the bottom 75 m of the 2 d resistive section also the same vertical low resistive channel has connection with one of the moderate resistive zones between 180 and 220 m from the origin present in the top layers resistivity of the third layer was mostly restricted between 13 34 ohm m and dominated most of the deeper parts of the resistivity section the top layer thickness 20 m along profile p4 fig 5b was mostly dominated by highly resistive zones also the resistivity of this layer further increased towards the end of the profile and attained a maximum value of 200 ohm m in addition a few breaks in the higher resistive part of the top layer with resistivities between 18 and 33 ohm m were observed between 0 70 m and 150 210 m locations along the profile these breaks merge with the moderately low resistive 13 33 ohm m second layer of the section the second layer reaches up to a depth of 65 85 m with resistivity values ranging between 13 and 33 ohm m and abruptly ends at 460 m distance from the origin a low resistive 13 ohm m third layer starts at a depth of 75 m from the surface however at 460 m from the origin this low resistive zone third layer also merges with the second layer the end part of profile p4 and the initial part of profile p3 were also situated in proximity fig 1 and it can be concluded that the subsurface resistivity distributions of both these profiles were nearly similar in nature and composed of moderate to high resistive sediment strata up to 10 15 m depth from the surface further the low resistive channel like feature in p3 was observed to be continuing up to 75 m below the surface a similar low resistive zone was observed to be continuing from 25 30 m below the surface to a depth of 145 m in the 2 d resistivity section of profile p4 thus it can be concluded that the region beyond 70 m depth is composed of low resistive sediment strata and the channel like feature from the second layer of profile p3 may be extending beyond 75 m depth hence this channel could be a prospective recharge zone and might be utilized for construction of artificial recharge wells that might help to infiltrate the rainwater in the deeper aquifer network for this region depth wise lithology data of the aquifer sediments could not be obtained for direct comparison with resistivity data unlike other regions 4 1 3 southern region the 2 d resistivity sections along the profiles p5 p7 fig 6 were acquired in the southern part of the study area located inside the recreational and playing grounds covered with lush green grass the maximum resistivity variation of 70 ohm m was observed in the profiles p5 inside hockey ground fig 6a otherwise this region was mostly dominated with low 10 ohm m to moderate 10 25 ohm m resistivity values overall the resistivity variations in this region were lowest in comparison to other regions inside the campus as this region stays waterlogged for longer duration in post monsoon season figure s3 in the profile p5 a moderate to high resistive 20 ohm m patch was visible in the top layer between 15 and 65 m from the origin highlighted with black dotted lines which continued till 140 m from the origin with a depth extent of 20 m below surface this patch broadened towards the deeper parts of the profile and continued till 155 m from the origin of the 2 d section also a low resistive resistivity 12 ohm m section was observed in the topmost part of the top layer from 70 m onwards along the profile length except this initial 70 m the rest of the profile p5 was passing through the hockey ground which is well maintained and regularly watered this may be resulting in the water saturated low resistive topmost part the initial part up to 150 m from origin of profile p6 lies inside the pronite ground fig 6b which is also covered with green grass and watered regularly as a result the resistivity range of this part of the top layer is similar to that of profile p5 due to water saturation fig 6a however from 290 to 330 m from the origin of the profile a lowest resistivity zone 5 ohm m was observed in the top layer and continues as a low resistive channel to the deeper part up to the maximum depth extent of the section one part of this channel at 310 m from the origin was merging with the bottom layers and extends till 80 m from the origin of the profile a moderate resistive layer 13 28 ohm m was also observed between the low resistive top and bottom layers highlighted with the black dotted line fig 6b along profile p7 fig 6c the initial 100 m of the profile from the origin was outside the pronite ground but mostly covered with grass and trees the resistivity trends observed in this profile were similar to that of profile p6 fig 6b with a low resistive top layer and a moderate resistive second layer confined between low resistive top and bottom layers comparison of the resistivity sections with the lithology chart obtained from borewell b2 fig 3 revealed the existence of sandy loam up to 3 m depth followed by clay and silt strata up to 6 m depth in the top layer table 2 the strata between 6 m and 40 m depth is mostly composed of fine sand with few layers of sandy loam coarse sand and clay in between thus the moderate to high resistivity layers between the low resistive top and bottom layers as visible in all the profiles of this region are mostly composed of fine and coarse sands which can serve as a good recharge channel 4 1 4 eastern region the profiles p8 p10 located in the eastern part of the study area demonstrated maximum resistivity variation of 150 ohm m fig 7 in profile p8 fig 7a which was acquired inside the aces ground the thickness of the top layer was 15 m below surface with resistivities between 30 and 60 ohm m till 110 m along the profile length however in the same layer a slightly higher resistivity 60 ohm m part was also observed between 110 and 200 m from the origin of the 2 d section the second layer mostly depicted moderate resistivity values ranging between 13 and 28 ohm m except for a few low resistive zones 13 ohm m between 78 115 m and 145 185 m from the origin of the profile at depths of 20 m and 25 m respectively further the visual inspection of the ground suggested that only a part of the ground up to 110 m length along the profile was well maintained with regular watering and lush green grass covering throughout the year making it water saturated the remaining parts of the ground were not maintained and were covered with large sized grass for most of the times making them unsaturated throughout the year except in the rainy season in profile p9 fig 7b the overall resistivity variation was very low compared to remaining profiles of this region the top layer was mostly moderately resistive 13 35 ohm m extending up to a depth between 20 and 40 m the second layer had mostly low resistivity 13 ohm m and extended up to 55 m depth profile p10 fig 7c was acquired inside the kendriya vidyalaya school kv ground a channel having resistivities between 13 and 28 ohm m was visible in the top layer between 80 m and 105 m distance from origin similar channel was again observed between 180 and 225 m from the origin of the profile fig 7c further this particular channel was also deviating deeper into the 2d section and connecting with the low resistive pockets with resistivity 10 ohm m and situated between 50 110 m and 130 160 m from the origin these low resistivity pockets were also confined between the high resistivity strata 60 ohm m extending to the deeper layers of the resistivity section as a result such network channels in the top layer could be utilized for feeding these low resistive pockets while comparing with the lithology obtained from borewell b3 fig 3 it was inferred that the top layer was mostly composed of highly unsaturated sandy loam and clay till the depth of 12 m with only 3 m thick fine sand strata in between however the strata within 12 m 40 m depth was mainly composed with fine sand with constitutive layers of sandy loam coarse sand and clay at depths of 21 33 m table 2 4 2 estimation of hydraulic parameters lithology charts of all the three locations i e b1 b2 and b3 clearly indicated the existence of fine sand strata between 12 40 m depth throughout the study area fig 3 yet quantification of hydraulic properties such as grain size distribution hydraulic conductivity and transmissivity of the study area can further increase the confidence on the indicative inferences drawn above the depth dependent variations of hydraulic parameters estimated from the sediment samples collected at b2 and b3 i e eastern and southern regions of the study area had little differences hydraulic conductivity with depth showed the overall variation of 0 4 4 m d 1 and 0 4 5 m d 1 for b2 and b3 locations respectively fig 8 when this variation was overlain on the lithology chart fig 8 the maximum value of hydraulic conductivity was obtained for the strata comprising mostly of fine sand with occasional layers of sandy loam and coarse sand between 5 and 30 m depth while the minimum value was obtained for the clay strata present in the top layer 3 6 m depth and 27 33 m below surface in both eastern and southern regions the transmissivity values estimated for these alluvial aquifers were found to be 78 m2 d 1 for both b2 and b3 fig 8 similar values of hydraulic conductivity and transmissivity were also reported in other alluvial aquifers of the world chen 2004 chen et al 2010 cheong et al 2008 dlubac et al 2013 fallico 2014 plata and rubio 2008 further from the grain size analysis of sediment samples from the two locations it was observed that the d 60 d 10 and u values varied between 0 19 and 0 75 mm 0 05 0 07 mm and 3 6 11 3 respectively at 0 40 m depth the percentage of fine sand was 85 for the location b3 and 75 for the location b2 the percentages of fine sand silt clay were 27 36 36 at depth 3 6 m and 36 46 17 at depths 30 33 m for b3 location table s1 the percentages of fine sand were minimum at both these depths in this location similarly at b2 the percentages of fine sand silt clay were 29 45 25 at depth 3 6 m and 21 50 28 at depth 27 30 m table s1 in the rest of the layers the percentages of fine sand in the sediments were higher in both the locations therefore it could be concluded that the calculated decrease in hydraulic conductivities was due to the decrease in the relative percentages of the fine sand in the sediments the indicative region of interest was narrowed down to 6 40 m depth by the joint interpretation of ert and lithology data at all the locations which were strongly supported by the direct estimates of hydraulic parameters from the collected sediment samples this monitoring was helpful in validating the results and highlighted the active channels and their connectivity with the deeper layers 4 3 time lapse ert study time lapse ert study was performed to monitor temporal changes in 2 d resistivity values to validate the results as well as highlight the active channels and their connectivity 4 3 1 along profile p5 inside the hockey ground the time lapse ert data sets of the profile p5 inside the hockey ground were acquired before the onset of the rainy season fig 9 a and after the rainy season fig 9b the processed 2 d resistivity section of the pre monsoon data showed a 20 m thick comparatively resistive channel between 15 and 65 m from the origin and were continued till 140 m before deviating to the deeper layer 20 35 m below surface between 140 and 160 m from the origin fig 9a highlighted with dotted black line the resistivity value of this channel varied between 20 and 60 ohm m and the remaining part of the section was mostly of low resistive nature with values 16 ohm m further it was evident from the 2 d resistivity section of post monsoon data that the resistivity value of the same channel reduced ranging between 20 and 35 ohm m however no temporal changes in resistivity values were observed in the rest of the resistivity section fig 9b also the observation drawn from the percentage nrr plot fig 9c indicated that the maximum reduction i e up to 28 had happened in the same channel highlighted with black dotted lines after the post monsoon season whereas the rest of the section showed a very low 4 12 increment in the nrr values it also delineated the connectivity of the channel with the deeper layers from the nrr plot we were able to quantify the amount of reduction happened in the prospective channel which was a limitation in the uniform color code approach fig 10 a and b the lithology chart table 2 of borewell b2 near the beginning of the profile suggested the presence of 15 m thick fine and coarse sand strata at 12 m depth from the top it can be inferred that the changes in the resistivity values of the channel observed in the nrr plot were mainly caused by the changes in saturation level due to infiltration of rainwater into the subsurface thus the identified channel might be considered as a potential recharge site for construction of artificial recharge wells 4 3 2 along profile p8 inside the aces ground the 2 d resistivity section of the pre monsoon dataset fig 10a revealed the presence of a high resistive 60 ohm m patch between 120 and 200 m location along the profile and extending till a depth of 15 m in the top layer of the profile p8 further visual inspection of this part of the site suggested that the soil was very dry infertile mostly covered with bushes and devoid of any water except in rainy seasons compared to the remaining parts which were well maintained with the lush green grass cover and received water regularly now this contrast in terms of saturation level was also reflected in the form of resistivity contrast after 120 m distance from origin however in the post monsoon datasets fig 10b the same high resistive patch was contracted from top of the layer but restricted to a depth of 10 15 m only this suggests that even though the saturation level changed there was no connection with the deeper layers rest of the top layer was mostly unaffected except few individual high resistive patches as they remained saturated throughout the year possibly due to the sprinkling of the water for ground maintenance in the lower part of the profile between 20 and 45 m below surface some patches of low resistive 20 ohm m zones were visible in pre monsoon datasets however these patches became continuous in post monsoon data and resistivity values reduced to 15 ohm m it was also evident that this low resistive patch was originating from the initial part of the profile and deviating to the deeper layer further the observations from the percentage nrr plot fig 10c clearly quantified the amount of reduction occurred highlighted with black dotted lines in the resistivity values the percentage nrr plot fig 10c indicated a maximum reduction up to 20 of resistivity values in the shallow layers i e up to 25 m in two channels one channel was at 10 110 m distance from the origin having few connections from the top layer between 45 and 75 m and 88 110 m also the same channel had shown a deeper connectivity at 90 115 m distance from the origin where a maximum reduction between 20 and 60 had been observed the increase in percentage of reduction of nrr values as observed at the deeper 25 m part of this channel clearly indicated that the shallow channel was the feeding source for the deeper layers the second channel was situated between 125 and 200 m from the origin at depth of 10 25 m below the surface it also had few disjointed connections from the top layer at 200 205 m and 220 m from the origin which were only limited up to 5 10 m depth from the surface unlike the first channel it was evident that this channel had no deeper connectivity however at a distance between 175 and 220 m from the origin a deviation was observed which might be connected with the deeper layers further the lithology chart table 2 from the nearest borewell b3 near to the end part of the profile revealed the presence of fine and coarse sandy strata mixed with occasional gravels and a small layer of clay of 30 m thick from 9 m depth below the surface from this comparison it can be concluded that there were indeed moderate resistive layers 10 m below the surface which were further confirmed by the grain size analysis careful grain size analysis confirmed the presence of fine and coarse sand layers at these depths from nrr results it was observed that the maximum reductions in resistivity values occurred in these strata these strata can be used for groundwater recharge 4 4 advantages limitations and transferability of the approach overall the results from this study have shown the effectiveness of the integrated approach in identifying prospective artificial recharge sites as well as the use of time lapse ert for monitoring of artificial recharge networks in replenishing the shallow aquifers this approach can be used repeatedly to monitor seasonal variation in the subsurface aquifer due to its non invasive and cost effective nature the use of nrr index estimation to quantify temporal reduction in resistivity values has never been attempted in geophysical studies related to groundwater exploration further determination of hydraulic conductivity and transmissivity using grain size distribution was cost effective and consumed less time than other in situ methods it also provided the relative composition of sand silt and clay in the aquifers which was helpful in determining the suitability of different strata for artificial recharge combination of sediment characterization and ert methods were helpful in identifying potential recharge zones in the aquifers table 3 for example in the southern region of this study area the correlations of resistivity grain size distribution and hydraulic conductivity indicated potential recharge zones after a depth of 6 m sediments of this recharge zone had relatively higher sand content than silt and clay which was also reflected in its higher hydraulic conductivities than that of sediments between 3 and 6 m depth similarly in the eastern region a high sand containing layer was obtained at depth 6 40 m however the resistivities at depths 6 15 m were higher than resistivities at depths 15 30 m and 33 40 m this could be due to the possible presence of unsaturated sand at 6 15 m depth and saturated sand at 15 40 m in this region recharge wells can be constructed within 6 15 m depth range however the variations in nrr values indicate significant seasonal changes between 15 and 40 m depths at 90 115 m distance from the starting point of the profile p8 fig 10 this also makes it a potential recharge zone in the eastern region of the study site thus combination of all these above approaches was helpful in identifying potential recharge zones inside the study area which to our knowledge has never been tried before there is significant variability and overlap in the defined range of electrical resistivity of earth materials as it depends on many factors such as rock type porosity type of the fluid present water saturation etc in some regions where the resistivity contrast is very less it is difficult to clearly distinguish the anomalous zones and the interpretations of the resistivity inversion results could be biased by expertise of the interpreter therefore it is important to assimilate specific geological hydrogeological and anthropogenic variations in the region while interpreting the findings pilot studies need to be performed in specific sites to understand the suitability of this approach in those regions also the ert technique should be used in conjunction with other suitable geophysical methods or non geophysical approaches to bring more confidence in the findings for example the integrated approach as adopted in this study overall this technique approach is cost effective time saving and transferable to other regions across the globe however the results need to be interpreted keeping the above mentioned parameters in mind 5 conclusions correlation of 2 d resistivity sections along with lithology has effectively delineated the prospective artificial recharge sites in the study area comprising fine and coarse sand strata the spatial extent and connectivity of identified potential zones with different layers were deciphered from the ert sections the variation of estimated hydraulic parameters with depth and grain size distribution further confirmed the presence of highly permeable strata at depths ranging between 6 to 48 m with high percentage of fine sand in southern and eastern parts of the study area also the changes visualized in the post monsoon resistivity sections of profile p5 and p8 in the southern and eastern part of study area confirmed the presence of highly permeable strata which effectively delineated the channel like feature of thickness 15 m connecting surface with deeper layers in which resistivity values changed significantly after the monsoon and attributed these changes to the infiltration of rainwater therefore this channel can act as a potential artificial recharge site also time lapse analysis of ert data along profile p8 has efficiently shown a prominent shallow aquifer starting at 15 m below the surface and extending up to the depth of investigation i e 50 m this channel could be utilized to manage the prevailing water shortage within the campus further an innovative way of plotting nrr to visualize the time lapse datasets has also significantly enhanced the interpretation by highlighting the subsurface regions where most changes have happened in the post monsoon resistivity values based on the above results two artificial recharge wells were constructed at locations b2 and b3 which are currently operational fig s4 thus the study provides an integrated cost effective approach for delineating prospective artificial recharge sites and monitoring their efficacy in replenishing shallow aquifers thereby enabling sustainable groundwater management declaration of competing interest the authors

11715,alluvial aquifers are one of the most exploited and easily accessible aquifer networks across the world as they coincide with regions of intensive human settlements over the years improper management and overexploitation of groundwater has severely stressed the natural replenishing capacity of these aquifer systems identification of potential artificial recharge networks and their monitoring are urgently needed for long term sustainable groundwater management in this study an efficient and cost effective strategy to locate prospective groundwater recharge zones is devised by integrating electrical resistivity tomography ert sediment characterization and temporal monitoring techniques the efficacy of the above strategy is evaluated in the central part of indo gangetic basin igb correlation of 2 d ert models with borehole lithology and depth wise variation of hydraulic parameters deciphered the existence of prospective regions composed of highly permeable strata within 6 48 m depth in addition the behavior of the delineated prospective regions was monitored by applying time lapse ert study the comparison of time lapse 2 d ert models highlighted a significant reduction in post monsoon resistivity profiles suggesting an increase in saturation levels due to infiltration of rainwater this study provides an integrated cost effective approach for identification of prospective artificial recharge sites and monitoring their efficacy in replenishing shallow aquifers thereby enabling sustainable groundwater management graphical abstract image 1 keywords alluvial aquifer indo gangetic basin groundwater artificial recharge ert time lapse data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction overexploitation and poor management of groundwater resources are causing rapid depletion of groundwater in alluvial aquifers globally as reported by numerous studies in the last few decades aeschbach hertig and gleeson 2012 bonsor et al 2017 macdonald et al 2015 shah et al 2009 shamsudduha et al 2011 these aquifer systems are mostly exploited due to ease of accessibility and widespread presence margat and van der gun 2013 at the same time the natural groundwater recharge processes in these aquifer systems have been severely impacted due to rapid urbanization increase in population and anthropogenic activities thereby creating an imbalance between the rate of recharge and abstraction of groundwater jha and sinha 2009 sharma et al 2010 alluvial aquifer systems of the indo gangetic basin igb form one of the most important groundwater reservoirs of the world and suffer the same fate the igb spans across the vast stretches of south asian countries like pakistan india nepal and bangladesh which are the largest consumers of groundwater for irrigation and household needs shah et al 2006 shamsudduha et al 2011 sharma et al 2010 approximately 25 of global groundwater abstraction happens from these alluvium systems through 15 20 million boreholes wada et al 2010 which has severely stressed this groundwater network therefore identification of prospective locations for developing networks of artificial recharge wells is crucial for sustainable groundwater management in these groundwater depleted regions the conventional approaches such as undisturbed sediment sampling infiltration test and pumping tests are traditionally used to identify the prospective artificial recharge zones but they are expensive and time consuming practices especially for the low to middle income countries mcinnis et al 2013 in addition these techniques are spatially constrained due to lack of wide data coverage which makes the regional scale interpretation more challenging however these limitations could be overcome by using geophysical methods among the various geophysical methods geoelectrical methods such as electrical resistivity tomography ert and vertical electrical sounding ves are particularly well suited for groundwater exploration because of their ability to delineate saturated and unsaturated zones with contrasting resistivities loke and barker 1996 apart from relatively low resistivity a potential groundwater storage zone is often associated with high hydraulic conductivity and transmissivity an accurate estimate of such hydraulic parameters plays an important role in understanding the storage capacity and flow of groundwater in an aquifer dor et al 2011 these parameters can be estimated by various methods such as in situ pumping test parallel drain laboratory based direct measurements constant head falling head and pore size distribution and laboratory based correlation grain size distribution oosterbaan and nijland 1994 the estimates of hydraulic parameters are constrained by discreteness of data sampling shape of particle pore distribution and particle packing freeze and cherry 1979 oosterbaan and nijland 1994 although the in situ methods provide finely discretized data the methods are expensive and time consuming whereas the laboratory based direct methods require collection of undisturbed sample core which is difficult to achieve while collecting water saturated sediments given these limitations the grain size distribution method using disturbed sediment samples is widely used to calculate hydraulic conductivity lu et al 2012 riva et al 2014 song et al 2009 vienken and dietrich 2011 from empirical formulae such as kozney carman and beyer equations beyer 1964 freeze and cherry 1979 recently a modified empirical equation developed by wang et al 2017 from a large dataset of rosas et al 2014 was shown to provide a more accurate prediction of hydraulic conductivity from grain size distribution data in some of the studies soupios et al 2007 vogelgesang et al 2020 an empirical relationship between the resistivity parameters obtained from the geoelectrical methods and the hydraulic parameters obtained from the correlation method was developed for a particular region where adequate number of boreholes were available afterwards the established empirical relationship was interpolated to estimate the hydraulic parameters of a region where borehole information was not available combination of hydraulic conductivity and transmissivity estimates from grain size distribution and ert can be a cost effective and rapid method to determine aquifer properties and locate potential recharge zones again monitoring of the temporal variation of subsurface resistivity especially pre and post monsoon is important to determine the seasonal variability in the identified artificial recharge sites it provides a comprehensive understanding of the migration channels and their connectivity with deeper zones it also provides a way to validate the findings of the conventional approaches as obtained from the discrete measurements as a result the use of ert study and time lapse ert monitoring have now become a common practice in countries facing groundwater scarcity arora and ahmed 2011 descloitres et al 2008 göktürkler et al 2008 hasan et al 2019 mojica et al 2013 nazaruddin et al 2017 saad et al 2017 tesfaldet and puttiwongrak 2019 wubda et al 2017 a few researchers have used geoelectrical methods for groundwater exploration along the indo gangetic plains kumar et al 2014 majumdar and pal 2005 however these methods particularly resistivity methods were rarely focused on identification of suitable groundwater recharge sites such as in the central alluvial plains of igb specially a time lapse ert study for monitoring the effectiveness of proposed artificial recharge sites is not available in this region therefore an integrated investigation using ert sediment characterization and temporal monitoring by time lapse ert data was performed as a case study at iit kanpur campus in the central part of igb to fulfill the following objectives a to identify potential artificial recharge sites in a typical alluvial setting and correlate these sites with their lithology b to estimate the hydraulic parameters from the sediment samples collected and analyze the variation in these parameters with depth c to monitor the seasonal variability i e pre and post monsoon of aquifer recharge using an innovative normalized resistivity ratio nrr approach to further validate the findings of the study 2 study area the present study area iit kanpur is located in kanpur nagar district of eastern uttar pradesh india fig 1 iit kanpur is situated over an area of 1000 acres and hosts 23 departments having 10 000 students staff and faculty members it is a fully residential campus with several amenities that use groundwater extensively such as laboratories hostels schools and sports facilities grounds and swimming pool etc the water demands of the campus since its establishment are met through several deep tube wells dtw at a depth of 350 400 m below ground level bgl and a few shallow tube wells stw at a depth of 250 m bgl personal communication from institute works department iwd section iit kanpur 2 1 geology the study site is a part of the vast ganges plains of igb fig 1 the area is mostly covered by quaternary age alluvium sediments as eroded from the himalayas and redistributed by river ganges and its tributaries the dominant lithology comprises gravel sand silt and clay overlain the basement of archean bundelkhand granite singh et al 2009 srivastava et al 2013 the maximum thickness of the alluvium sediments is reported to be 500 m in the study area the alluvial sediments are further categorized into older alluvium deposited along the central part of igb during lower to upper pleistocene period and newer alluvium deposited along the course of the river during upper pleistocene to recent period singh 1996 2 2 geomorphology the kanpur district exhibits a relatively flat topography with the master slope aligned from north west to south east direction with an average elevation of the land surface of 125 m above mean sea level two rivers the ganga and the pandu drain through the area singh et al 2009 sinha et al 2005 geo morphologically the city is divided into two groups i lowlands or younger alluvial plains bangar and ii uplands or older alluvial plain khadar singh 1996 the lowlands are flat to gently sloping and have a large area of undulating terrain formed by river deposition paleo channels meander scar and oxbow lakes are some of the common fluvial landforms present srivastava and singh 1999 the uplands area is somewhat stable with the highest topography of the region mostly formed by extensive deposition of older alluvium singh 1996 in addition salt encrustation patches have been reported from few locations which suggest the presence of shallow water tables sinha et al 2002 2005 2 3 hydrogeology aquifer system in kanpur district has been divided into three major groups shallow middle and deep aquifers singh et al 2006 groundwater in shallow aquifer i e up to 50 m bgl occurs under unconfined to semi unconfined conditions and this zone is the primary source of potable water to tube wells dug wells and is thereby prone to over exploitation in the middle aquifer i e 90 240 m bgl groundwater occurs in confined conditions the presence of overlying and underlying clay beds has restricted its usage as an effective groundwater source the deep aquifer lies between 180 and 450 m bgl and has good yielding capacity groundwater in this zone occurs under confined conditions and is exploited to a lesser extent singh et al 2006 3 methodology 3 1 resistivity survey and data analysis to identify potential recharge sites geophysical data sets were acquired using electrical resistivity tomography ert technique at ten locations profiles p1 p10 inside iit kanpur premises between october 2018 to february 2020 fig 1 survey sites were selected at different parts of the campus for wider coverage of the study area and to ensure that at least 230 m of length was available to conduct the survey i e after avoiding buildings dense bushes electrical and gas pipelines this minimum length was necessary to obtain a depth section in the range of 45 60 m in each region at p5 and p8 locations the surveys were conducted in june 2019 and repeated in january 2020 time lapse ert surveys to monitor the temporal variability by keeping the data acquisition parameters the same 3 1 1 data acquisition ert data were acquired using syscal r1 plus iris instruments france resistivity meter with 72 stainless steel electrodes figure s1a b the electrodes were laid along a straight line at a constant spacing a between two electrodes figure s1c d electrodes were connected to the resistivity meter via multi core cables each of 120 m length for each measurement a predefined computer program automatically selects two electrode pairs one pair each for current and potential at a time based on various input parameters such as type of array number of electrodes electrode spacing voltage applied etc datasets were acquired using hybrid wenner schlumberger array which is moderately sensitive to both lateral and vertical subsurface resistivity variations bichet et al 2016 loke 2001 detailed survey parameters of all the profiles are given in table 1 data along all the profiles were acquired with 500 ms current injection time per cycle output voltage of 400 v maximum and minimum numbers of stacking as 16 and 4 respectively and a maximum admitted error of 5 3 1 2 data processing and modelling pre processing of the acquired raw data was performed to remove the inconsistent erroneous and spiky data thereby to avoid propagation of such errors in the results often such noisy data appear due to loose contact filled up material and presence of subsurface utilities loke 2001 after data filtration the measured apparent resistivity contours were plotted in the form of 2 d pseudo depth sections which approximately represent the subsurface resistivity distribution fig 2 a next by inverting the measured apparent resistivity data the true distribution of subsurface resistivity variation was obtained arora and ahmed 2011 in this work the inverse modelling was performed using the res2dinv software wherein a 2d resistivity model was first determined using the distribution of data in the pseudo section i e the data in the measured apparent resistivity contours subsequently by employing the finite difference modelling scheme the apparent resistivity values were calculated for the above resistivity model and the calculated apparent resistivity contours were plotted by the software loke 2001 fig 2b further a smoothness constrained least squares optimization technique ellis and oldenburg 1994 loke and barker 1996 was utilized for minimizing the misfit between the measured and calculated apparent resistivity values iteratively herein the misfit was calculated in terms of root mean square error rmse finally the resistivity model that corresponded to the least rmse was considered as the best fit 2 d resistivity model fig 2c for the measured apparent resistivity values 3 1 3 estimation of normalized resistivity ratio nrr for the time lapse ert model comparison of 2 d resistivity sections using same color code helps in delineating subsurface regions of similar resistivity variation over an area bichet et al 2016 mishra et al 2019 such an approach also works well for time lapse 2 d resistivity sections in delineating the subsurface regions that have undergone seasonal resistivity changes when no changes in geology are assumed however this color code approach is only qualitative in nature and fails to quantify the resistivity changes that help in finding regions with maximum resistivity variation in this study an innovative approach to get optimal visualization of the changes in the time lapse resistivity sections has been presented through the computation of normalized resistivity ratio nrr the percentage of nrr was calculated from the pre march may and post october february monsoon resistivity values as obtained from the inverse models of the respective time lapse dataset using the formula given below 1 n r r ρ p o s t ρ p r e ρ p o s t ρ p r e 100 where ρ p o s t and ρ p r e refer to post and pre monsoon resistivity values respectively the nrr approach is based on the well established index ratios such as normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and normalized burn ratio nbr that are used as indicators to enhance certain characteristic features in remote sensing measurements escuin et al 2008 the negative values highlight the regions with reduced resistivity values whereas the positive values highlight the regions with increased resistivity values zero indicates the regions with no changes between the resistivity values of pre and post monsoon periods 2 d resistivity models were segregated into four regions i e central to eastern northern southern and eastern based on the locations of the profiles in the study area the profiles falling under the same region were presented with a uniform color code also the time lapse resistivity sections from the two locations i e p5 and p8 were compared by keeping uniform color code and using the plots of percentage nrr values 3 2 sediment sampling characterization and preparation of litholog three lithologs one existing and other two prepared during this study were analyzed in this study to get an overview of the major sediment types present in the study area figs 1 and 3 the lithology from a location b1 near railway line fig 1 was previously prepared by iwd iit kanpur additionally new aquifer sediments were collected from two locations hockey ground b2 and main gate b3 inside iit kanpur campus fig 1 using water boring in this process water was constantly pumped into the bore to loosen the sediment while the borewell was drilled simultaneously using a drill bit figure s2 the sediments were withdrawn through a pipe and were collected in a pan excess water was discarded from the pan and the sediments were transferred and stored in clean polythene ziplock bags samples were collected at every 3 m up to 40 m below the surface fig 3 the texture and grain size distribution of collected sediments was determined using a combination of sieve and hydrometer analyses bis 1994 sodium hexametaphosphate was used as a dispersant in hydrometer analysis for each sediment sample a grain size distribution was generated by plotting mass percent finer with respect to particle diameter on a log scale sheet 1 and sheet 2 of electronic annexure xls sediment properties such as d 60 diameter at which 60 particles are finer and d 10 diameter at which 10 particles are finer were determined from the grain size distribution plots sheet 3 of electronic annexure xls wang et al 2017 provided an empirical formula to calculate hydraulic conductivity from the grain size distribution data provided the dataset met the following criteria d 60 0 09 4 29 m m d 10 0 05 0 83 m m u 1 3 18 3 where d 60 is the diameter at which 60 particles are finer d 10 is the diameter at which 10 particles are finer and u is coefficient of uniformity d 60 d 10 as d 60 d 10 and u values determined for sediment samples collected in this study met the above criteria details in sheet 3 of electronic annexure xls the hydraulic conductivity for each sediment sample was calculated using the empirical relation eq 2 given by wang et al 2017 2 k w c w g v log g ⅆ 60 3 v 2 1 d e 2 where k w denotes hydraulic conductivity m d 1 c w is wang sorting coefficient 2 9 10 3 g is acceleration due to gravity 9 81 m s 2 ʋ is kinematic viscosity of water 8 9 10 7 m2 s 1 at 25 c and d e is effective diameter m same as d 10 here k w was estimated under the assumption of an isotropic symmetric medium a constant k w value was calculated for each 3 m layer the use of grain size distribution of disturbed sediments for calculation of hydraulic conductivity provides only an approximate estimate because particle packing in the aquifer is a major factor in determining hydraulic properties freeze and cherry 1979 oosterbaan and nijland 1994 however this method is time efficient cost effective and can be performed on disturbed sediments that are easier to collect from water saturated aquifers transmissivity t m2 d 1 of the shallow aquifers was calculated from the hydraulic conductivity of each sampled sediment profile k wi using the expression below 3 t i 1 n k w i d where d represents the depth of each sampled sediment profile 3 m and n represents the number of depth profiles sampled in the aquifer between two clay layers 3 2 1 a typical calculation of hydraulic conductivity k and transmissivity t at location b2 the hydraulic conductivity k and transmissivity t were calculated based on the grain size distribution for the sediment sample of 24 27 m depth that satisfy the criteria mentioned by wang et al 2017 the d 60 d 10 and u values for this sediment samples were as follows d 60 0 000276 m d 10 d e 0 000063 m and u d 60 d 10 4 38 applying the empirical formula eq 2 the hydraulic conductivity was computed as follows k w c w g v log g ⅆ 60 3 v 2 1 d e 2 2 9 10 3 9 81 8 9 10 7 log 9 81 2 76 10 4 3 8 9 10 7 2 1 6 3 10 5 2 4 527 m d 1 given that at b2 the aquifer lies between 6 m to 27 m below the surface positioned between two clay layers the overall transmissivity t m2 d 1 of this aquifer can be calculated from summation of products of hydraulic conductivities and depths in this case every 3 m of each layer eq 3 so the t for the 6 27 m aquifer was calculated as follows t i 1 n k w i d 4 083 2 766 4 103 4 129 4 305 2 917 4 527 3 80 5 m 2 d 1 hydraulic conductivities and transmissivity values of other layers and aquifers were calculated and are shown in sheets 2 and 3 of the electronic annexure xls file finally the lithology charts of the bore wells b1 b3 were correlated with the corresponding 2 d resistivity sections and with the estimated hydraulic parameters 4 results and discussion 4 1 distribution of the layers and resistivity variations 4 1 1 central to eastern region the 2 d resistivity sections of the profiles p1 and p2 revealed a three layer configuration with a maximum resistivity value of 350 ohm m fig 4 a and b along the length of profile p1 fig 4a a moderately resistive 18 50 ohm m top layer with a thickness of 10 15 m was identified which was mostly continuous except for a few breaks in the form of low resistive 18 ohm m channels between 20 45 m and between 90 130 m distances from the origin of the profile fig 4a further these channels were connected with a low resistive second layer whose thickness increased from 20 m close to the origin of the profile to 50 m towards the end of the profile a moderately resistive third layer was observed at 35 m below the surface at 80 m from the origin and goes till the bottom of the section before ending at 190 m from the origin in profile p2 fig 4b a moderately resistive top layer was also observed with few breaks in the form of low resistive zones between 20 30 m 90 220 m and 300 350 m from the origin however the thickness of the layer varied between 15 and 20 m similar to p1 a low resistive second layer was observed at 15 m below the surface which continued up to 80 90 m depth the thickness of this layer was 60 m between 80 and 290 m from the origin of the profile but the thickness decreased to 35 m between 290 and 340 m however the thickness again increased to 80 m after 340 m from the origin a low resistive channel like feature from the second layer to the deeper layer was observed between 400 and 460 m from the origin another moderately resistive layer was observed below the second layer from a depth of 75 m in the resistivity section between 220 and 370 m from the origin and squeezing up to 50 m below surface between 310 and 370 m distance from the origin after 80 90 m depth a highly resistive 50 ohm m layer was observed between 270 and 365 m from the origin a comparison with the lithological information obtained from the borewell b1 near the profile p1 figs 1 3 and 4c and table 2 indicated that the topmost layer up to 10 m depth with moderate resistivity values consisted of highly unsaturated surface soil occasionally mixed with clay strata a low resistive layer was found at 10 m depth below surface till a depth of 50 55 m between 10 and 330 m from the origin of profile p1 likewise a continuous second layer up to 60 70 m depth below surface along p2 were mainly composed of fine sand with variable saturation levels the layer below that was mostly composed of clay and hard clay which resulted in a highly resistive layer beyond the 80 m depth between 320 and 360 m from the origin overall the second layer of 40 60 m thickness with variable water saturation composed of fine sand and could be a potential storage site of shallow groundwater which can be utilized for groundwater abstraction and recharging in this region 4 1 2 northern region the three layer resistivity configuration as identified for profiles p1 and p2 was also observed along the profile p3 fig 5 a the top layer 10 m thick consisted of four zones a moderately resistive zone 13 50 ohm m up to 80 m distance a highly resistive zone 50 ohm m between 85 and 180 m and two moderate resistive zones at approximately 180 210 m and 300 m respectively from the origin of the profile the moderately resistive zone was dipping downward and mixing with the second layer at 290 m distance from the origin a low resistive second layer with resistivity 13 ohm m was observed below the top layer and extending up to 30 35 m depth from the surface at around 190 220 m distance from origin a vertical low resistive channel from the second layer extends downward into the moderate resistive patches of the third layer and reaches till the bottom 75 m of the 2 d resistive section also the same vertical low resistive channel has connection with one of the moderate resistive zones between 180 and 220 m from the origin present in the top layers resistivity of the third layer was mostly restricted between 13 34 ohm m and dominated most of the deeper parts of the resistivity section the top layer thickness 20 m along profile p4 fig 5b was mostly dominated by highly resistive zones also the resistivity of this layer further increased towards the end of the profile and attained a maximum value of 200 ohm m in addition a few breaks in the higher resistive part of the top layer with resistivities between 18 and 33 ohm m were observed between 0 70 m and 150 210 m locations along the profile these breaks merge with the moderately low resistive 13 33 ohm m second layer of the section the second layer reaches up to a depth of 65 85 m with resistivity values ranging between 13 and 33 ohm m and abruptly ends at 460 m distance from the origin a low resistive 13 ohm m third layer starts at a depth of 75 m from the surface however at 460 m from the origin this low resistive zone third layer also merges with the second layer the end part of profile p4 and the initial part of profile p3 were also situated in proximity fig 1 and it can be concluded that the subsurface resistivity distributions of both these profiles were nearly similar in nature and composed of moderate to high resistive sediment strata up to 10 15 m depth from the surface further the low resistive channel like feature in p3 was observed to be continuing up to 75 m below the surface a similar low resistive zone was observed to be continuing from 25 30 m below the surface to a depth of 145 m in the 2 d resistivity section of profile p4 thus it can be concluded that the region beyond 70 m depth is composed of low resistive sediment strata and the channel like feature from the second layer of profile p3 may be extending beyond 75 m depth hence this channel could be a prospective recharge zone and might be utilized for construction of artificial recharge wells that might help to infiltrate the rainwater in the deeper aquifer network for this region depth wise lithology data of the aquifer sediments could not be obtained for direct comparison with resistivity data unlike other regions 4 1 3 southern region the 2 d resistivity sections along the profiles p5 p7 fig 6 were acquired in the southern part of the study area located inside the recreational and playing grounds covered with lush green grass the maximum resistivity variation of 70 ohm m was observed in the profiles p5 inside hockey ground fig 6a otherwise this region was mostly dominated with low 10 ohm m to moderate 10 25 ohm m resistivity values overall the resistivity variations in this region were lowest in comparison to other regions inside the campus as this region stays waterlogged for longer duration in post monsoon season figure s3 in the profile p5 a moderate to high resistive 20 ohm m patch was visible in the top layer between 15 and 65 m from the origin highlighted with black dotted lines which continued till 140 m from the origin with a depth extent of 20 m below surface this patch broadened towards the deeper parts of the profile and continued till 155 m from the origin of the 2 d section also a low resistive resistivity 12 ohm m section was observed in the topmost part of the top layer from 70 m onwards along the profile length except this initial 70 m the rest of the profile p5 was passing through the hockey ground which is well maintained and regularly watered this may be resulting in the water saturated low resistive topmost part the initial part up to 150 m from origin of profile p6 lies inside the pronite ground fig 6b which is also covered with green grass and watered regularly as a result the resistivity range of this part of the top layer is similar to that of profile p5 due to water saturation fig 6a however from 290 to 330 m from the origin of the profile a lowest resistivity zone 5 ohm m was observed in the top layer and continues as a low resistive channel to the deeper part up to the maximum depth extent of the section one part of this channel at 310 m from the origin was merging with the bottom layers and extends till 80 m from the origin of the profile a moderate resistive layer 13 28 ohm m was also observed between the low resistive top and bottom layers highlighted with the black dotted line fig 6b along profile p7 fig 6c the initial 100 m of the profile from the origin was outside the pronite ground but mostly covered with grass and trees the resistivity trends observed in this profile were similar to that of profile p6 fig 6b with a low resistive top layer and a moderate resistive second layer confined between low resistive top and bottom layers comparison of the resistivity sections with the lithology chart obtained from borewell b2 fig 3 revealed the existence of sandy loam up to 3 m depth followed by clay and silt strata up to 6 m depth in the top layer table 2 the strata between 6 m and 40 m depth is mostly composed of fine sand with few layers of sandy loam coarse sand and clay in between thus the moderate to high resistivity layers between the low resistive top and bottom layers as visible in all the profiles of this region are mostly composed of fine and coarse sands which can serve as a good recharge channel 4 1 4 eastern region the profiles p8 p10 located in the eastern part of the study area demonstrated maximum resistivity variation of 150 ohm m fig 7 in profile p8 fig 7a which was acquired inside the aces ground the thickness of the top layer was 15 m below surface with resistivities between 30 and 60 ohm m till 110 m along the profile length however in the same layer a slightly higher resistivity 60 ohm m part was also observed between 110 and 200 m from the origin of the 2 d section the second layer mostly depicted moderate resistivity values ranging between 13 and 28 ohm m except for a few low resistive zones 13 ohm m between 78 115 m and 145 185 m from the origin of the profile at depths of 20 m and 25 m respectively further the visual inspection of the ground suggested that only a part of the ground up to 110 m length along the profile was well maintained with regular watering and lush green grass covering throughout the year making it water saturated the remaining parts of the ground were not maintained and were covered with large sized grass for most of the times making them unsaturated throughout the year except in the rainy season in profile p9 fig 7b the overall resistivity variation was very low compared to remaining profiles of this region the top layer was mostly moderately resistive 13 35 ohm m extending up to a depth between 20 and 40 m the second layer had mostly low resistivity 13 ohm m and extended up to 55 m depth profile p10 fig 7c was acquired inside the kendriya vidyalaya school kv ground a channel having resistivities between 13 and 28 ohm m was visible in the top layer between 80 m and 105 m distance from origin similar channel was again observed between 180 and 225 m from the origin of the profile fig 7c further this particular channel was also deviating deeper into the 2d section and connecting with the low resistive pockets with resistivity 10 ohm m and situated between 50 110 m and 130 160 m from the origin these low resistivity pockets were also confined between the high resistivity strata 60 ohm m extending to the deeper layers of the resistivity section as a result such network channels in the top layer could be utilized for feeding these low resistive pockets while comparing with the lithology obtained from borewell b3 fig 3 it was inferred that the top layer was mostly composed of highly unsaturated sandy loam and clay till the depth of 12 m with only 3 m thick fine sand strata in between however the strata within 12 m 40 m depth was mainly composed with fine sand with constitutive layers of sandy loam coarse sand and clay at depths of 21 33 m table 2 4 2 estimation of hydraulic parameters lithology charts of all the three locations i e b1 b2 and b3 clearly indicated the existence of fine sand strata between 12 40 m depth throughout the study area fig 3 yet quantification of hydraulic properties such as grain size distribution hydraulic conductivity and transmissivity of the study area can further increase the confidence on the indicative inferences drawn above the depth dependent variations of hydraulic parameters estimated from the sediment samples collected at b2 and b3 i e eastern and southern regions of the study area had little differences hydraulic conductivity with depth showed the overall variation of 0 4 4 m d 1 and 0 4 5 m d 1 for b2 and b3 locations respectively fig 8 when this variation was overlain on the lithology chart fig 8 the maximum value of hydraulic conductivity was obtained for the strata comprising mostly of fine sand with occasional layers of sandy loam and coarse sand between 5 and 30 m depth while the minimum value was obtained for the clay strata present in the top layer 3 6 m depth and 27 33 m below surface in both eastern and southern regions the transmissivity values estimated for these alluvial aquifers were found to be 78 m2 d 1 for both b2 and b3 fig 8 similar values of hydraulic conductivity and transmissivity were also reported in other alluvial aquifers of the world chen 2004 chen et al 2010 cheong et al 2008 dlubac et al 2013 fallico 2014 plata and rubio 2008 further from the grain size analysis of sediment samples from the two locations it was observed that the d 60 d 10 and u values varied between 0 19 and 0 75 mm 0 05 0 07 mm and 3 6 11 3 respectively at 0 40 m depth the percentage of fine sand was 85 for the location b3 and 75 for the location b2 the percentages of fine sand silt clay were 27 36 36 at depth 3 6 m and 36 46 17 at depths 30 33 m for b3 location table s1 the percentages of fine sand were minimum at both these depths in this location similarly at b2 the percentages of fine sand silt clay were 29 45 25 at depth 3 6 m and 21 50 28 at depth 27 30 m table s1 in the rest of the layers the percentages of fine sand in the sediments were higher in both the locations therefore it could be concluded that the calculated decrease in hydraulic conductivities was due to the decrease in the relative percentages of the fine sand in the sediments the indicative region of interest was narrowed down to 6 40 m depth by the joint interpretation of ert and lithology data at all the locations which were strongly supported by the direct estimates of hydraulic parameters from the collected sediment samples this monitoring was helpful in validating the results and highlighted the active channels and their connectivity with the deeper layers 4 3 time lapse ert study time lapse ert study was performed to monitor temporal changes in 2 d resistivity values to validate the results as well as highlight the active channels and their connectivity 4 3 1 along profile p5 inside the hockey ground the time lapse ert data sets of the profile p5 inside the hockey ground were acquired before the onset of the rainy season fig 9 a and after the rainy season fig 9b the processed 2 d resistivity section of the pre monsoon data showed a 20 m thick comparatively resistive channel between 15 and 65 m from the origin and were continued till 140 m before deviating to the deeper layer 20 35 m below surface between 140 and 160 m from the origin fig 9a highlighted with dotted black line the resistivity value of this channel varied between 20 and 60 ohm m and the remaining part of the section was mostly of low resistive nature with values 16 ohm m further it was evident from the 2 d resistivity section of post monsoon data that the resistivity value of the same channel reduced ranging between 20 and 35 ohm m however no temporal changes in resistivity values were observed in the rest of the resistivity section fig 9b also the observation drawn from the percentage nrr plot fig 9c indicated that the maximum reduction i e up to 28 had happened in the same channel highlighted with black dotted lines after the post monsoon season whereas the rest of the section showed a very low 4 12 increment in the nrr values it also delineated the connectivity of the channel with the deeper layers from the nrr plot we were able to quantify the amount of reduction happened in the prospective channel which was a limitation in the uniform color code approach fig 10 a and b the lithology chart table 2 of borewell b2 near the beginning of the profile suggested the presence of 15 m thick fine and coarse sand strata at 12 m depth from the top it can be inferred that the changes in the resistivity values of the channel observed in the nrr plot were mainly caused by the changes in saturation level due to infiltration of rainwater into the subsurface thus the identified channel might be considered as a potential recharge site for construction of artificial recharge wells 4 3 2 along profile p8 inside the aces ground the 2 d resistivity section of the pre monsoon dataset fig 10a revealed the presence of a high resistive 60 ohm m patch between 120 and 200 m location along the profile and extending till a depth of 15 m in the top layer of the profile p8 further visual inspection of this part of the site suggested that the soil was very dry infertile mostly covered with bushes and devoid of any water except in rainy seasons compared to the remaining parts which were well maintained with the lush green grass cover and received water regularly now this contrast in terms of saturation level was also reflected in the form of resistivity contrast after 120 m distance from origin however in the post monsoon datasets fig 10b the same high resistive patch was contracted from top of the layer but restricted to a depth of 10 15 m only this suggests that even though the saturation level changed there was no connection with the deeper layers rest of the top layer was mostly unaffected except few individual high resistive patches as they remained saturated throughout the year possibly due to the sprinkling of the water for ground maintenance in the lower part of the profile between 20 and 45 m below surface some patches of low resistive 20 ohm m zones were visible in pre monsoon datasets however these patches became continuous in post monsoon data and resistivity values reduced to 15 ohm m it was also evident that this low resistive patch was originating from the initial part of the profile and deviating to the deeper layer further the observations from the percentage nrr plot fig 10c clearly quantified the amount of reduction occurred highlighted with black dotted lines in the resistivity values the percentage nrr plot fig 10c indicated a maximum reduction up to 20 of resistivity values in the shallow layers i e up to 25 m in two channels one channel was at 10 110 m distance from the origin having few connections from the top layer between 45 and 75 m and 88 110 m also the same channel had shown a deeper connectivity at 90 115 m distance from the origin where a maximum reduction between 20 and 60 had been observed the increase in percentage of reduction of nrr values as observed at the deeper 25 m part of this channel clearly indicated that the shallow channel was the feeding source for the deeper layers the second channel was situated between 125 and 200 m from the origin at depth of 10 25 m below the surface it also had few disjointed connections from the top layer at 200 205 m and 220 m from the origin which were only limited up to 5 10 m depth from the surface unlike the first channel it was evident that this channel had no deeper connectivity however at a distance between 175 and 220 m from the origin a deviation was observed which might be connected with the deeper layers further the lithology chart table 2 from the nearest borewell b3 near to the end part of the profile revealed the presence of fine and coarse sandy strata mixed with occasional gravels and a small layer of clay of 30 m thick from 9 m depth below the surface from this comparison it can be concluded that there were indeed moderate resistive layers 10 m below the surface which were further confirmed by the grain size analysis careful grain size analysis confirmed the presence of fine and coarse sand layers at these depths from nrr results it was observed that the maximum reductions in resistivity values occurred in these strata these strata can be used for groundwater recharge 4 4 advantages limitations and transferability of the approach overall the results from this study have shown the effectiveness of the integrated approach in identifying prospective artificial recharge sites as well as the use of time lapse ert for monitoring of artificial recharge networks in replenishing the shallow aquifers this approach can be used repeatedly to monitor seasonal variation in the subsurface aquifer due to its non invasive and cost effective nature the use of nrr index estimation to quantify temporal reduction in resistivity values has never been attempted in geophysical studies related to groundwater exploration further determination of hydraulic conductivity and transmissivity using grain size distribution was cost effective and consumed less time than other in situ methods it also provided the relative composition of sand silt and clay in the aquifers which was helpful in determining the suitability of different strata for artificial recharge combination of sediment characterization and ert methods were helpful in identifying potential recharge zones in the aquifers table 3 for example in the southern region of this study area the correlations of resistivity grain size distribution and hydraulic conductivity indicated potential recharge zones after a depth of 6 m sediments of this recharge zone had relatively higher sand content than silt and clay which was also reflected in its higher hydraulic conductivities than that of sediments between 3 and 6 m depth similarly in the eastern region a high sand containing layer was obtained at depth 6 40 m however the resistivities at depths 6 15 m were higher than resistivities at depths 15 30 m and 33 40 m this could be due to the possible presence of unsaturated sand at 6 15 m depth and saturated sand at 15 40 m in this region recharge wells can be constructed within 6 15 m depth range however the variations in nrr values indicate significant seasonal changes between 15 and 40 m depths at 90 115 m distance from the starting point of the profile p8 fig 10 this also makes it a potential recharge zone in the eastern region of the study site thus combination of all these above approaches was helpful in identifying potential recharge zones inside the study area which to our knowledge has never been tried before there is significant variability and overlap in the defined range of electrical resistivity of earth materials as it depends on many factors such as rock type porosity type of the fluid present water saturation etc in some regions where the resistivity contrast is very less it is difficult to clearly distinguish the anomalous zones and the interpretations of the resistivity inversion results could be biased by expertise of the interpreter therefore it is important to assimilate specific geological hydrogeological and anthropogenic variations in the region while interpreting the findings pilot studies need to be performed in specific sites to understand the suitability of this approach in those regions also the ert technique should be used in conjunction with other suitable geophysical methods or non geophysical approaches to bring more confidence in the findings for example the integrated approach as adopted in this study overall this technique approach is cost effective time saving and transferable to other regions across the globe however the results need to be interpreted keeping the above mentioned parameters in mind 5 conclusions correlation of 2 d resistivity sections along with lithology has effectively delineated the prospective artificial recharge sites in the study area comprising fine and coarse sand strata the spatial extent and connectivity of identified potential zones with different layers were deciphered from the ert sections the variation of estimated hydraulic parameters with depth and grain size distribution further confirmed the presence of highly permeable strata at depths ranging between 6 to 48 m with high percentage of fine sand in southern and eastern parts of the study area also the changes visualized in the post monsoon resistivity sections of profile p5 and p8 in the southern and eastern part of study area confirmed the presence of highly permeable strata which effectively delineated the channel like feature of thickness 15 m connecting surface with deeper layers in which resistivity values changed significantly after the monsoon and attributed these changes to the infiltration of rainwater therefore this channel can act as a potential artificial recharge site also time lapse analysis of ert data along profile p8 has efficiently shown a prominent shallow aquifer starting at 15 m below the surface and extending up to the depth of investigation i e 50 m this channel could be utilized to manage the prevailing water shortage within the campus further an innovative way of plotting nrr to visualize the time lapse datasets has also significantly enhanced the interpretation by highlighting the subsurface regions where most changes have happened in the post monsoon resistivity values based on the above results two artificial recharge wells were constructed at locations b2 and b3 which are currently operational fig s4 thus the study provides an integrated cost effective approach for delineating prospective artificial recharge sites and monitoring their efficacy in replenishing shallow aquifers thereby enabling sustainable groundwater management declaration of competing interest the authors

11716,excess amount of nitrate in water systems has a tremendous health effect on human beings and demands the proper mitigation approach in response to this in this report a novel al2o3 fe3o4 zro2 almzr ternary nanocomposite was synthesized at metals mole percent ratio al fe zr 25 70 05 by co precipitation method under a nitrogen atmosphere it was dried at 60 c and characterized using state of

nitrate adsorption isotherms and d r studies revealed that the adsorbent undergoes both physi and chemisorption from the kinetics study the pseudo second order model well fitted with the experimental data the thermodynamic study revealed the favorability of nitrate adsorption at low temperatures from desorption and regeneration studies it was also observed that desorption has been more favored by sonication than a shaker and the adsorbent showed fairly good regeneration the order for the influence of co existing ions on the tendency of nitrate removal was clo4 so4 2 hco3 cl f the present study suggests the ternary magnetic nanocomposite al2o3 fe3o4 zro2 for the uptake of excess no3 from aqueous systems with better recyclability graphical abstract image 1 keywords sorption magnetite nanocomposite nitrate removal almzr data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction various activities of humans have seriously affected the natural nitrogen cycle of the earth which in turn resulted in an extreme accumulation of nitrogen in different forms kasani et al 2020 one of the nitrogen containing species no3 is among the inorganic contaminants detected in higher concentrations bhatnagar and sillanpää 2011 pahlavanzadeh et al 2012 amarine et al 2020 which can cause serious health effects to human if it is above the permissible limit of drinking water katal et al 2012 no3 could be reduced to no2 in our body which can easily combine with hemoglobin and result in blue baby syndrome methemoglobinemia afjeh et al 2020 and formation of carcinogenic nitrosamine causes stomach cancer in adults kumar et al 2019 it can also result in many problems including respiratory tract infections hypertension diarrhea spontaneous abortion birth defects abdominal pain diabetes vomiting and changes in the immune systems song et al 2012 because of this different regulatory bodies in many countries have set nitrate permissible limits in drinking water including who 50 mg l world health organization 2011 epa 10 mg l epa 2009 australia 50 mg l australian drinking water guidelines 6 2011 and south africa is 20 mg l no3ˉ masukume et al 2011 removal of no3ˉ from aqueous systems seems complicated and difficult by conventional methods like filtration because it is stable and highly soluble with low potential for precipitation islam and patel 2010 ensie and samad 2014 thus the advance in treatment methods that simplify its removal from groundwater and wastewater before it is directly discharged into natural waters is vital accordingly literature reports indicate that various physicochemical and biological approaches are being used to remove nitrate from aqueous systems xing et al 2011 xu et al 2012 nevertheless most nitrate removal processes have an adverse effect on the environment for example they are not cost effective have less reusability and have low removal capacity thus adsorption of nitrate by synthetic inorganic nanocomposites is considered an eye catching method because it has been proved to be effective efficient economical simple and could avoid the problems existing in other conventional treatment methods of water purification jiang and ashekuzzaman 2012 li et al 2012 magnetic separation technology is an important method to develop magnetite based nanocomposites with great potential for large volumes of wastewater and simplification of separation from the solution using an external magnet chai et al 2013 to enhance the performance of fe3o4 for adsorption of ions other elements such as mn al ce zr etc oxides can be added shu and wang 2009 li et al 2012 in this regard various composite adsorbents where magnetite is a part have been synthesized because the addition of fe3o4 to the other transition metal oxides facilitates separation of the adsorbent from sample solution easily with a magnet ianos et al 2014 ghafoor and ata 2017 and enables functional group modifications to specific contaminants fang et al 2019 zro2 is also known for its recalcitrant nature making it suitable for the sorption process although binary nanocomposite of fe3o4 zro2 fang et al 2019 fe3o4 al2o3 peng et al 2011 jung et al 2017 and zro2 al2o3 ito et al 2014 jogiaas et al 2020 have been reported similar report for the ternary system is scant metallic oxides particularly iron and aluminum were reported as attractive materials to remove anions from aqueous systems because of their positive surface charges kumar et al 2011 hence we propose a novel al2o3 fe3o4 zro2 ternary nanocomposite synthesized at different al fe zr metal mole percent ratios with an appreciable surface area as a promising nanomaterial to successfully remove nitrate ions from an aqueous

purification salt precursors and standards of nitrate were prepared using deionized water di 2 2 synthesis of magnetic al2o3 zro2 fe3o4 composite the magnetic al2o3 fe3o4 zro2 nanocomposite was synthesized at four different al fe zr metals mole percent ratios 20 75 05 25 70 05 20 70 10 and 25 65 10 and the nanomaterial with the highest surface area was carefully chosen for the successive sorption studies magnetic ferrofluids fe3o4 of 75 70 and 65 of fe2 fe3 at 1 2 mol ratios were prepared using the stoichiometric amount of fecl3 6h2o and fecl2 4h2o the salt precursors were dissolved in 0 3 m hcl in separate beakers these solutions were transferred into separatory funnels and added dropwise into solutions of 120 ml of 3 0 m naoh and magnetically stirred for a couple of hours at 80 c under a nitrogen atmosphere then the suspensions were allowed to settle undisturbed for 4 h this step was followed by washing the settled part several times with di chai et al 2013 wang et al 2014 al2o3 fe3o4 zro2 nanocomposite containing the four different metal ratios were prepared by dropwise addition of stoichiometric amounts of al no3 3 9h2o and zrocl2 8h2o salts dissolved in four separate beakers with 100 ml di each solution was transferred into the separate ferrofluid dropwise followed by ultrasonication for 10 min then the ph of each mixture was adjusted by 0 1 and 0 01 m naoh and hno3 before they were magnetically stirred for 1 5 h at 70 c the supernatant solutions were decanted and the remaining part was washed with di repeatedly and subjected to drying at 60 c for one day 2 3 characterization of al2o3 zro2 fe3o4 the surface area of each synthesized nanosorbent was investigated by making use of brunauer emmett teller bet analysis based on the findings of this analysis the nanocomposite exhibiting the maximum surface area was selected and characterized by aas ftir xrd and sem edx 2 4 nitrate analysis the absorbance of each standard solution was recorded with a double beam uv vis spectrophotometer λ 220 nm followed by drawing the corresponding calibration curve as absorbance versus concentration mg l finally the absorbance of each no3 sample after adsorption and desorption was measured from the standard curve edwards et al 2001 2 5 ph of point zero charge phpzc in six separate 150 ml polyethylene bottles 0 001 m nano3 50 ml was added and the ph of each was set to 2 12 using 0 1 and 0 01 m aqueous solutions of hno3 and naoh then 100 mg of the nanocomposite was transferred to each flask all test solutions were equilibrated on a mechanical shaker for 60 min and the initial ph values of all samples were determined simultaneously 1 g of solid nano3 was added to each solution and further equilibrated for another 60 min after equilibration ph of each sample was determined and the point at which the graph of ph initial final vs ph initial crossed each other was taken as the phpzc of the nanosorbent shah et al 2018 2 6 the effect of ph here the sample solution was prepared in a ph range of 1 6 by making use of aqueous solutions of hcl and naoh after this kno3 50 ml was added to each of the 25 mg adsorbents in a 150 ml polyethylene bottle followed by shaking for 24 h at 25 c using a temperature controlled water bath shaker finally the concentration of nitrate was determined and the optimum ph value was then selected and used for consecutive experiments gammoudi et al 2012 2 7 effect of quantity of the adsorbent this particular experiment was investigated using 50 ml of 15 mg l of no3 mixed with each of 5 15 25 50 75 and 100 mg adsorbents in a polyethylene bottle and kept for 24 h on a shaker at optimum adsorption ph the solutions were separated and the nitrate concentration was determined in the filtrates 2 8 batch adsorption studies the optimum quantity of the ternary nanocomposite was placed in 50 ml bottles containing 15 mg l of nitrate then initial ph was fixed at the optimum ph and all solutions were equilibrated continuously at 25 c in a water bath shaker after equilibrium has been attained the adsorbent was separated by a magnet and filtered through a sintered glass followed by a membrane filter the reproducibility of each measurement was determined through triplicate experiments according to hamoudi and belkacemi 2013 the quantity of nitrate adsorbed mg g was calculated for initial and equilibrium nitrate concentrations designated as co and ce mg l respectively with a mass of the nanocomposite m and volume v at equilibrium by eq 1 1 q e c o c e x v m similarly the percent removal of nitrate ions was determined at equilibrium using eq 2 2 r c o c e c o x 100 2 9 nitrate adsorption isotherms the isotherms were determined by using 50 ml of 6 9 12 and 15 mg l no3 equilibrated with the nanocomposite 25 mg in separate flasks for 24 h on a water bath shaker at 25 c and optimum ph the equilibrium distribution of no3 in the system was investigated by making use of common isotherm models the uniform and monolayer adsorption process is described by the langmuir model whereas multilayer adsorption on a non uniform adsorbent surface is represented by the freundlich model on the other hand the dubinin radushkevich d r model identifies nature of the adsorption accordingly the linear form of the langmuir isotherm model is represented in eq 3 seliem et al 2011 3 c e q e c e q o

solution to the surfaces of the nanocomposite was also determined using eq 8 8 e 1 2 β 2 10 adsorption kinetics adsorption kinetics was investigated by placing 25 mg of the nanocomposite into 50 ml of 5 10 and 15 mg l of kno3 in a 150 ml polyethylene flask for 1 2 4 8 12 and 24 h at 25 c and ph 3 after equilibration the solid and the liquid phases were separated and analysis was done on the filtrate the adsorption capacity of the nanocomposite at equilibrium mg g with concentrations of nitrate mg l at the beginning co and at a time t ct for the mass of the adsorbent m and volume of the

the removal of no3 ions on the nanocomposite the following thermodynamic parameters were evaluated by making use of eq 13 15 13 k d δ h r t δ s r k d v m c o c e c e 14 δ rt ln kd 15 δgo δho tδso where kd distribution coefficient l mol 2 12 desorption of nitrate from the nanocomposite the desorption tendency of the nitrate ions after adsorbed on the nanocomposite was evaluated by adding 50 ml naoh 0 1 m into the flask containing the nitrate loaded adsorbent the resulting mixture was then ultrasonicated for 30 min with an ultrasonic vibrator finally the desorption rate d of nitrate was calculated using eq 16 16 d q i q t q i where qi and qt are nitrate concentrations at the beginning and after a contact time of t mg l 1 karimi et al 2010 2 13 regeneration study the regeneration and reusability potential of the nanocomposite was studied by loading 15 mg l of nitrate and equilibrating it for 6 h keeping all other experimental parameters at their optimum values it was then washed with 0 1 m naoh for 15 min finally the nanocomposite was rinsed for 30 min using di till it shows a similar ph value as di mukherjee and de 2014 after drying the adsorbent was reloaded again 2 14 influence of competing ions the nanocomposite s selectivity for nitrate removal with existing ions of cl hco3 clo4 so4 2 and f was investigated the prepared nanocomposite 25 mg was separately equilibrated with 25 ml of kno3 15 mg l and then mixed with 0 01 m of cl f clo4 and 0 005 m of so4 2 and hco3 for 24 h separately on a shaker the nitrate concentration was then evaluated in the filtrates 3 results and discussion 3 1 quality control all nitrate determination experiments were performed initially by calibrating the uv vis instrument baseline by measuring the absorbance of a series of standard solutions of no3 and plotting the calibration curve all slopes and intercepts of the linear plots were tested at a 95 confidence limit by applying a t test lod and loq of the method employed in the present study were determined by blank matrix blank analyses and obtained as 0 007 and 0 021 mg l respectively 3 2 characterization of al fe zr oxide nanocomposites 3 2 1 surface area the bet surface area of four protocol samples of almzr composites at different mole ratios 20 70 10 20 75 05 25 65 10 and 25 70 05 were found to be 129 68 144 89 150 58 and 296 50 m2 g respectively the result showed that all the samples have a relatively large surface area when compared with the value reported for fe3o4 al2o3 59 57 chai et al 2013 fe3o4 al2o3 63 37 jung et al 2017 al2o3 zro2 130 sarkara et al 2007 fe3o4 zro2 155 5 jiang et al 2013 and al2o3 zro2 fe3o4 199 wang et al 2014 in m2 g 1 almzr nanocomposite with a mole percent ratio of 25 70 05 exhibits the highest surface area 296 50 m2 g in this work almzr with the largest surface area 296 50 m2 g was selected for the study of nitrate removal 3 2 2 ftir analysis the nanocomposite s surface properties were investigated using ft ir and the findings are presented fig 1 the predominant bands appearing from 3411 to 3413 cm 1 are attributed to stretching vibrations of the oh groups halajnia et al 2013 and the peaks around 1628 cm 1 for both spectra correspond to h o h bending vibrations of the physically adsorbed water molecules and to the bending vibration of zr oh groups taavoni gilan et al 2010 bands exhibited at 2923 and 2853 cm 1 represent c h stretching and anti symmetrical and symmetrical h o h stretching vibrational modes long et al 2011 wang et al 2014 the peak observed at 1384 cm 1 before adsorption of nitrate might be emerged from n n stretching taavoni gilan et al 2010 teimouri et al 2016 due to surface adsorption of n2 gas used during synthesis process for preventing oxidation of magnetite after adsorption a sharp absorption band at 1384 cm 1 indicates the nitrate ions attached on the magnetic nanocomposite halajnia et al 2013 the peaks at 1163 and 1629 cm 1 correspond to bending vibration of zr oh taavoni gilan et al 2010 and the peak observed at 1065 cm 1 may correspond to al o stretching kumar et al 2011 the increased intensities of peaks at 3411 cm 1 especially after nitrate sorption indicate the increased adsorption of the interlayer water molecule and formation of hydrogen bonds between oh and no3 groups during nitrate adsorption halajnia et al 2013 teimouri et al 2016 the peak intensity at 1628 and 578 cm 1 increased due to oh bending modes of vibrational frequencies of an adsorbed intermolecular water molecule further the peaks at 579 and 475 cm 1 are assigned to zro2 and fe o stretching vibrations respectively teimouri et al 2016 jung et al 2017 3 2 3 xrd analysis the xrd patterns of almzr ternary oxide nanocomposite are demonstrated in fig 2 the strongest peaks at 2θ values of 30 14 35 57 43 20 57 17 62 79 and 74 52 could be assigned to magnetite fe3o4 jcpds 96 900 5840 no specific peaks were observed on the xrd pattern that can be associated with alumina al2o3 and zirconia zro2 this is due to low calcination temperature 60 c there is also evidence that alumina may homogeneously be dispersed into the structure of zro2 al2o3 forming an amorphous uniform bicomponent of zro2 al2o3 nanocomposites that have been coated on fe3o4 wang et al 2014 furthermore as the atomic ratio of al zr 5 1 is larger the amorphous nature of alumina also increased bartolomé et al 2016 it has been reported that t zro2 and al2o3 crystalize only at high temperatures 1100 and 1200 c respectively jogiaas et al 2020 the nanocomposite s average crystallite sizes were calculated considering the full width at half maximum fwhm of the strongest reflection peak 2θ value of 35 56 in this regard the scherer approximation was applied to calculate the particle size with the mathematical expression given in eq 17 17 d k λ β cos θ where d is the crystallite size in nm k is the shape factor constant and taken as 0 9 β is the full width at half maximum fwhm 0 8035 rad λ is the wavelength of the x ray 0 15406 nm for cu target kα radiation and θ is the bragg s angle accordingly the mean crystallite size of the nanocomposite was then found to be 2 51 nm and have a cubic structure 3 2 4 aas analysis the efficiency test of the preparation technique was made by determining the amount of each metal mole percent ratio in the selected adsorbent the result of elemental analysis is presented in table 1 the concentration of al was not determined due to the lack of oxidant nitrous oxide gas the concentrations of fe and zr in the as synthesized nanocomposite were measured by digesting 0 1 g of the selected sample with a weight percent ratio 25 70 05 the result showed that 85 30 fe and 3 20 zr were available in the sample taken while the initial precursor contains 86 63 fe and 3 28 zr this implies that the applied synthesis method was efficient 3 2 5 sem edx analysis results from sem analysis are given in fig 3 a to d a closer look at the images revealed that in accordance with their atomic number the bright phase indicates zr while alumina particles appeared as a dark phase biamino et al 2006 the elemental analysis of these micrographs fig 3 showed the presence of the three metal constituents in the ranges of 5 3 8 0 al 87 7 92 1 fe and 2 6 4 2 zr as shown in table 2 the initial percentage of the precursor metals used during synthesis were 7 66 10 26 al 82 81 89 11 fe and 3 23 6 94 zr the observed slight variation in the metals w w percent ratio distribution might be due to the dispersion technique employed in the co precipitation method 3 3 ph of point zero charge phpzc the phpzc of the magnetic nanocomposite was assessed from the plot of ph final initial vs ph final for 100 mg of the adsorbent the result is presented in fig 4 a as indicated in the graphs the value of phpzc of the adsorbent was found to be 6 8 accordingly the nanocomposite exhibits a negatively charged surface at ph greater than the phpzc and positively charged below the phpzc 3 4 effect of ph removal of inorganic and organic species from aqueous systems could depend on various experimental parameters including ph mainly because it affects the adsorbent s surface charge the degree of ionization and the speciation of adsorbate pahlavanzadeh et al 2012 the influence of ph on the adsorption of no3 by almzr was studied at a ph range set from 1 to 6 phpzc 6 8 and the result is presented in fig 4 b it was observed that during the initial steps adsorption increased up to ph 3 due to large free adsorption sites and later decreased as the ph increased due to the competition between no3 and oh for adsorption and saturation of the un adsorbed sites at ph 3 the adsorbent exhibited no3 removal capacity of 98 75 above ph 3 adsorption of nitrate dropped down as a result of this ph 3 was taken as the optimum value for consecutive experiments this result is in agreement with no3 removal by nano alumina bhatnagar and sillanpää 2011 and nitrate removal by n zero valent iron supported by polystyrene resins jiang et al 2011 3 5 effect of quantity of the adsorbent the optimum of quantity of the nanocomposite was determined and the result is presented in fig 5 from the result it is observed that 97 81 of nitrate was removed by 25 mg of the nanocomposite with further addition of the adsorbent a plateau is formed indicating that no significant increase in adsorption was taking place this might be due to the fact that surface adsorption sites became more saturated in the first rapid step and no more surface adsorption sites remained thus the nitrate ions might have started to diffuse into the bulk matrix taddesse et al 2015 elkhaleefa et al 2021 in addition the ft ir spectral analysis assured that the disappearance of adsorption frequencies of peaks at 2923 and 2853 cm 1 a slight decrease in frequencies of peaks at 3413 1629 and 579 cm 1 might be due to the exchange of oh functional groups with no3 1 during the adsorption process 3 6 batch adsorption studies and adsorption isotherms from batch experiments the adsorbent has shown 97 64 1 07 of nitrate removal capacity this value represents 28 83 0 21 mg g of the adsorbate the distribution of nitrate at equilibrium was investigated using three isotherm models accordingly langmuir isotherm values were calculated from the linear plot of log ce qe vs log ce and the values of each parameter are given in table 3 from the results it is observed that the langmuir isotherm model is in better agreement with the adsorption experiment than the freundlich isotherm from the results obtained it can be deduced that nitrate was sorbed as a monolayer coverage hokkanen et al 2014 however the values obtained from freundlich isotherm parameters such as kf 19 23 mg g indicated a significant value that implied the possibility of multilayer sorption to determine the favorability of adsorption the separation factor rl values were computed the values obtained for initial concentrations of 6 9 12 and 15 mg l were 0 951 0 928 0 906 and 0 886 respectively thus the calculated values are ranging 0 rl 1 which attributes the adsorption process was favorable at the studied parameters the decreasing trend of rl values with increasing nitrate concentration suggests that there was an increased affinity between nitrate and the adsorbent furthermore the value of 1 n or 0 234 is ranging between 0 and 1 showing surface heterogeneity zhan et al 2011 the d r model was also applied to determine the behavior of nitrate adsorption onto the almzr accordingly the value of the sorption energy e was calculated to be 4 082 kj mol 1 if the value of e lies between 1 and 8 it indicates that the adsorption process undergoes physisorption aghaii et al 2013 therefore from the three isotherm models values of the various parameters such as r2 rl 1 n n and e it was observed that the adsorption of nitrate by almzr ternary nanocomposite undergoes both physisorption and chemisorption processes 3 7 adsorption kinetics this was studied using batch experiments at initial concentrations of 5 10 and 15 mg l over 1 2 4 8 12 and 24 h at room temperature 25 c optimum adsorbent quantity and ph the kinetics model that best describes the adsorption process was selected mainly depending on the values of qe exp and qe cal and linear correlation coefficient r2 values at the studied conditions from the result the r2 values for the pseudo first order model were 0 672 0 451 and 0 681 and r2 values for the pseudo second order model were also found to be 0 991 0 997 and 0 998 respectively table 4 from the comparison of r2 values the pseudo second order model best fitted the adsorption process as all its values showed above 0 99 from this result it can be inferred that the rate determining step could be chemisorption which involves valence forces through sharing or exchange of electrons between the nanocomposite and the nitrate ions in the solution harrache et al 2019 the involvement of intraparticle diffusion in the adsorption process can be interpreted as follows a linear plot using the mathematical expression described in eq 12 indicates its involvement on the other hand if the line passes through the origin it shows that it is the only rate determining step however if the line represents multi linearity it is an indication of the complexity of the process teimouri et al 2016 the plot of intraparticle diffusion kinetic model is given in fig 6 the graph for adsorptive removal of nitrate by the nanocomposite can essentially be divided into three steps 0 1 h 1 2 h and above 2 h for the external surface adsorption or instantaneous adsorption stage the gradual adsorption the adsorption rate was limited by intra particle diffusion stage and the final equilibrium the intra particle diffusion started to cease stage respectively the result demonstrates the complexity of the process that may involve both external and intraparticle diffusion processes xu et al 2013 3 8 thermodynamics parameters at this point the adsorptive removal of no3 by the magnetic nanocomposite was investigated with 5 10 and 15 mg l concentrations of nitrate at 288 298 308 318 and 324 k the result of the experiment revealed an inverse relationship between the adsorption of nitrate and temperature this indicated that the reaction was exothermic in nature from the isotherm plots it was observed that the coefficient of determination r2 for langmuir isotherm were 0 9986 0 9991 and 0 9958 and for freundlich isotherm 0 9535 0 9621 and 0 9786 respectively at the studies concentration accordingly the former isotherm model best fitted the experimental data than the latter the apparent distribution coefficient kd values showed a decreasing trend with increasing temperature for all the three ion concentrations table 5 as a result affinity of the nanocomposite for the no3 was found to be higher at lower temperature which could be attributed to the exothermic nature of the sorption process to decide the mechanism involved in the process thermodynamic parameters such as gibbs free energy δg enthalpy change δh and entropy change δs were determined from the linear plots of lnkd vs 1 t the thermodynamic parameter results δh⁰ δs⁰ and δg⁰ calculated from linear equations of the plots for the studied concentrations showed that standard free energy δg⁰ values at the studied temperatures were negative showing that nitrate adsorption onto the adsorbent was thermodynamically feasible 3 9 desorption study evaluation of desorption of nitrate ions with sonicator and mechanical shaker was performed by placing the nitrate loaded adsorbent into 50 ml of 0 1 m naoh and equilibrated for 30 min summarized values of desorption are given in table 6 below for comparison the amount of nitrate desorbed was found to be 95 82 by sonication and 88 36 by mechanical shaker indicating that nitrate was more desorbed by sonicator than a mechanical shaker that was due to the non thermal effects of the ultrasonic field karimi et al 2010 3 10 regeneration cycle to evaluate the possibility of regenerating the nanocomposite for repeated use an experiment was performed with 15 mg l of no3 at optimum conditions for 6 h nitrate removal capacity of the adsorbent for four cycles of adsorption desorption steps is indicated in table 7 the adsorption potential of the nanocomposite after the fourth cycle has decreased from 98 58 to 73 65 and desorption has decreased from 90 17 to 61 96 this value sufficiently displayed the fairly good regeneration capacity and reusability of the adsorbent for nitrate removal using naoh as an eluent 3 11 effect of competing ions adsorptive removal potential of the nanocomposite for nitrate in a system containing cl f so4 2 hco3 and clo4 was studied at 15 mg l nitrate concentration and 25 mg of the adsorbent and the results are shown in fig 7 from this particular experimental undertaking it was found that these ions have some sort of interference with the nitrate removal by the adsorbent all the anions considered competed with the nitrate ion for the cationic sorption sites of the nanocomposite but f ion exhibited less competing tendency with nitrate for adsorption than the rest this is mainly because in most cases monovalent anions have weaker electrostatic interactions and low affinity to adsorption sites than divalent ions awual et al 2011 the influence of these ions decreased in the order of clo4 so4 2 hco3 cl f in general anions with higher charge have a higher affinity towards positively charged adsorption sites and show a higher competing tendency gogoi et al 2019 this phenomenon was also observed in this study by sulphate and hco3 which actually dissociate to co3 2 in acidic media 3 12 possible mechanism of nitrate adsorption the various experimental undertakings revealed that nitrate ions are promisingly adsorbed by the ternary nanocomposite reported in this work although it is difficult to give a single mechanism for the adsorptive removal process some plausible mechanisms are presented as follows firstly the ftir spectra showed that the synthesized nanocomposite is rich in oh groups thus the nitrate may be adsorbed by ion exchange bhatnagar et al 2010 or through hydrogen bonding teimouri et al 2016 with the hydroxyl group as described in eqs 18 and 19 respectively 18 m oh no 3 m no 3 oh 19 m oh no 3 m oh no 3 in addition to this the nitrate ions were preferably adsorbed at a ph of 3 at this ph value the oh groups found on the surface of the nanocomposite could be protonated this process favors the electrostatic attraction between the adsorbent and the nitrate eq 20 yang et al 2017 20 m oh2 no 3 m oh2 no 3 where m represents al fe and zr 3 13 comparison previous reports the removal capacity of almzr was compared with previous reports a relatively greater removal capacity of nitrate was observed in the present work compared with most reported values and could be selected for its better recyclability and environmentally friendly nature many of the reports cited in table 8 employed very high initial nitrate concentration 100 mg l the amount removed however did not correspond to the initial concentration in the present case a relatively smaller amount of nitrate 15 mg l was used however quantity of the target analyte removed was comparable with others indicating the ability of the as synthesized nanomaterial for efficient uptake of nitrate 4 conclusion al2o3 zro2 fe3o4 almzr nanocomposite was successfully synthesized characterized and applied for no3 uptake from an aqueous system the nanocomposite exhibited an appreciable surface area 296 5 m2 g during the adsorption process ph was found to affect its efficiency and the optimum ph was found to be 3 with regard to kinetics study the results revealed that pseudo second order kinetics model best fitted the adsorption process on the other hand the adsorption isotherm study revealed that both isotherm models considered in the present study can be used to describe nitrate removal the adsorptive removal capacity of the synthesized nanocomposite for nitrate 28 83 mg g is comparable with those reported in the literature moreover the influence of co existing ions was found in the order of f cl hco3 so4 2 clo 4 therefore al2o3 zro2 fe3o4 ternary nanocomposite can be suggested as a promising nanomaterial to remove of excess nitrates from an aqueous solution with better recyclability funding this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public

11716,excess amount of nitrate in water systems has a tremendous health effect on human beings and demands the proper mitigation approach in response to this in this report a novel al2o3 fe3o4 zro2 almzr ternary nanocomposite was synthesized at metals mole percent ratio al fe zr 25 70 05 by co precipitation method under a nitrogen atmosphere it was dried at 60 c and characterized using state of the art instruments like xrd ftir bet and sem edx elemental composition was determined by faas the average crystallite size was obtained as 2 5 nm with the corresponding surface area 296 5 m2 g nitrate adsorption isotherms and d r studies revealed that the adsorbent undergoes both physi and chemisorption from the kinetics study the pseudo second order model well fitted with the experimental data the thermodynamic study revealed the favorability of nitrate adsorption at low temperatures from desorption and regeneration studies it was also observed that desorption has been more favored by sonication than a shaker and the adsorbent showed fairly good regeneration the order for the influence of co existing ions on the tendency of nitrate removal was clo4 so4 2 hco3 cl f the present study suggests the ternary magnetic nanocomposite al2o3 fe3o4 zro2 for the uptake of excess no3 from aqueous systems with better recyclability graphical abstract image 1 keywords sorption magnetite nanocomposite nitrate removal almzr data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction various activities of humans have seriously affected the natural nitrogen cycle of the earth which in turn resulted in an extreme accumulation of nitrogen in different forms kasani et al 2020 one of the nitrogen containing species no3 is among the inorganic contaminants detected in higher concentrations bhatnagar and sillanpää 2011 pahlavanzadeh et al 2012 amarine et al 2020 which can cause serious health effects to human if it is above the permissible limit of drinking water katal et al 2012 no3 could be reduced to no2 in our body which can easily combine with hemoglobin and result in blue baby syndrome methemoglobinemia afjeh et al 2020 and formation of carcinogenic nitrosamine causes stomach cancer in adults kumar et al 2019 it can also result in many problems including respiratory tract infections hypertension diarrhea spontaneous abortion birth defects abdominal pain diabetes vomiting and changes in the immune systems song et al 2012 because of this different regulatory bodies in many countries have set nitrate permissible limits in drinking water including who 50 mg l world health organization 2011 epa 10 mg l epa 2009 australia 50 mg l australian drinking water guidelines 6 2011 and south africa is 20 mg l no3ˉ masukume et al 2011 removal of no3ˉ from aqueous systems seems complicated and difficult by conventional methods like filtration because it is stable and highly soluble with low potential for precipitation islam and patel 2010 ensie and samad 2014 thus the advance in treatment methods that simplify its removal from groundwater and wastewater before it is directly discharged into natural waters is vital accordingly literature reports indicate that various physicochemical and biological approaches are being used to remove nitrate from aqueous systems xing et al 2011 xu et al 2012 nevertheless most nitrate removal processes have an adverse effect on the environment for example they are not cost effective have less reusability and have low removal capacity thus adsorption of nitrate by synthetic inorganic nanocomposites is considered an eye catching method because it has been proved to be effective efficient economical simple and could avoid the problems existing in other conventional treatment methods of water purification jiang and ashekuzzaman 2012 li et al 2012 magnetic separation technology is an important method to develop magnetite based nanocomposites with great potential for large volumes of wastewater and simplification of separation from the solution using an external magnet chai et al 2013 to enhance the performance of fe3o4 for adsorption of ions other elements such as mn al ce zr etc oxides can be added shu and wang 2009 li et al 2012 in this regard various composite adsorbents where magnetite is a part have been synthesized because the addition of fe3o4 to the other transition metal oxides facilitates separation of the adsorbent from sample solution easily with a magnet ianos et al 2014 ghafoor and ata 2017 and enables functional group modifications to specific contaminants fang et al 2019 zro2 is also known for its recalcitrant nature making it suitable for the sorption process although binary nanocomposite of fe3o4 zro2 fang et al 2019 fe3o4 al2o3 peng et al 2011 jung et al 2017 and zro2 al2o3 ito et al 2014 jogiaas et al 2020 have been reported similar report for the ternary system is scant metallic oxides particularly iron and aluminum were reported as attractive materials to remove anions from aqueous systems because of their positive surface charges kumar et al 2011 hence we propose a novel al2o3 fe3o4 zro2 ternary nanocomposite synthesized at different al fe zr metal mole percent ratios with an appreciable surface area as a promising nanomaterial to successfully remove nitrate ions from an aqueous

synthesized at four different al fe zr metals mole percent ratios 20 75 05 25 70 05 20 70 10 and 25 65 10 and the nanomaterial with the highest surface area was carefully chosen for the successive sorption studies magnetic ferrofluids fe3o4 of 75 70 and 65 of fe2 fe3 at 1 2 mol ratios were prepared using the stoichiometric amount of fecl3 6h2o and fecl2 4h2o the salt precursors were dissolved in 0 3 m hcl in separate beakers these solutions were transferred into separatory funnels and added dropwise into solutions of 120 ml of 3 0 m naoh and magnetically stirred for a couple of hours at 80 c under a nitrogen atmosphere then the suspensions were allowed to settle undisturbed for 4 h this step was followed by washing the settled part several times with di chai et al 2013 wang et al 2014 al2o3 fe3o4 zro2 nanocomposite containing the four different metal ratios were prepared by dropwise addition of stoichiometric amounts of al no3 3 9h2o and zrocl2 8h2o salts dissolved in four separate beakers with 100 ml di each solution was transferred into the separate ferrofluid dropwise followed by ultrasonication for 10 min then the ph of each mixture was adjusted by 0 1 and 0 01 m naoh and hno3 before they were magnetically stirred for 1 5 h at 70 c the supernatant solutions were decanted and the remaining part was washed with di repeatedly and subjected to drying at 60 c for one day 2 3 characterization of al2o3 zro2 fe3o4 the surface area of each synthesized nanosorbent was investigated by making use of brunauer emmett teller bet analysis based on the findings of this analysis the nanocomposite exhibiting the maximum surface area was selected and characterized by aas ftir xrd and sem edx 2 4 nitrate analysis the absorbance of each standard solution was recorded with a double beam uv vis spectrophotometer λ 220 nm followed by drawing the corresponding calibration curve as absorbance versus concentration mg l finally the absorbance of each no3 sample after adsorption and desorption was measured from the standard curve edwards et al 2001 2 5 ph of point zero charge phpzc in six separate 150 ml polyethylene bottles 0 001 m nano3 50 ml was added and the ph of each was set to 2 12 using 0 1 and 0 01 m aqueous solutions of hno3 and naoh then 100 mg of the nanocomposite was transferred to each flask all test solutions were equilibrated on a mechanical shaker for 60 min and the initial ph values of all samples were determined simultaneously 1 g of solid nano3 was added to each solution and further equilibrated for another 60 min after equilibration ph of each sample was determined and the point at which the graph of ph initial final vs ph initial crossed each other was taken as the phpzc of the nanosorbent shah et al 2018 2 6 the effect of ph here the sample solution was prepared in a ph range of 1 6 by making use of aqueous solutions of hcl and naoh after this kno3 50 ml was added to each of the 25 mg adsorbents in a 150 ml polyethylene bottle followed by shaking for 24 h at 25 c using a temperature controlled water bath shaker finally the concentration of nitrate was determined and the optimum ph value was then selected and used for consecutive experiments gammoudi et al 2012 2 7 effect of quantity of the adsorbent this particular experiment was investigated using 50 ml of 15 mg l of no3 mixed with each of 5 15 25 50 75 and 100 mg adsorbents in a polyethylene bottle and kept for 24 h on a shaker at optimum adsorption ph the solutions were separated and the nitrate concentration was determined in the filtrates 2 8 batch adsorption studies the optimum quantity of the ternary nanocomposite was placed in 50 ml bottles containing 15 mg l of nitrate then initial ph was fixed at the optimum ph and all solutions were equilibrated continuously at 25 c in a water bath shaker after equilibrium has been attained the adsorbent was separated by a magnet and filtered through a sintered glass followed by a membrane filter the reproducibility of each measurement was determined through triplicate experiments according to hamoudi and belkacemi 2013 the quantity of nitrate adsorbed mg g was calculated for initial and equilibrium nitrate concentrations designated as co and ce mg l respectively with a mass of the nanocomposite m and volume v at equilibrium by eq 1 1 q e c o c e x v m similarly the percent removal of nitrate ions was determined at equilibrium using eq 2 2 r c o c e c o x 100 2 9 nitrate adsorption isotherms the isotherms were determined by using 50 ml of 6 9 12 and 15 mg l no3 equilibrated with the nanocomposite 25 mg in separate flasks for 24 h on a water bath shaker at 25 c and optimum ph the equilibrium distribution of no3 in the system was investigated by making use of common isotherm models the uniform and monolayer adsorption process is described by the langmuir model whereas multilayer adsorption on a non uniform adsorbent surface is represented by the freundlich model on the other hand the dubinin radushkevich d r model identifies nature of the adsorption accordingly the linear form of the langmuir isotherm model is represented in eq 3 seliem et al 2011 3 c e q e c e q o 1 k l q o kl l mg langmuir constant qo adsorption capacity the dimensionless constant r l was computed from eq 4 4 r l 1 1 k l c o in a similar manner the linear form of the freundlich isotherm having kf a constant is expressed by eq 5 5 log q e log k f 1 n log c e to further explain the physical and chemical features of the as synthesized nanocomposite for no3 uptake dubinin radushkevich model was also used to calculate qe the quantity of adsorbate adsorbed per unit mass of the nanocomposite mg g by relating qm the theoretical adsorption capacity mol g with β the adsorption energy constant mol2 kj2 and ԑ the polanyi potential as indicated in eq 6 6 ln q e ln q m β ε 2 the polanyi potential ԑ has its own mathematical expression which is related to temperature in k and the gas constant r kj mol 1 k 1 as shown in eq 7 7 ԑ r t l n 1 1 c e with the value of β determined from the plot of lnqe vs ε 2 the average sorption energy e the free energy for the movement of 1 mol of no3 in the solution to the surfaces of the nanocomposite was also determined using eq 8 8 e 1 2 β 2 10 adsorption kinetics adsorption kinetics was investigated by placing 25 mg of the nanocomposite into 50 ml of 5 10 and 15 mg l of kno3 in a 150 ml polyethylene flask for 1 2 4 8 12 and 24 h at 25 c and ph 3 after equilibration the solid and the liquid phases were separated and analysis was done on the filtrate the adsorption capacity of the nanocomposite at equilibrium mg g with concentrations of nitrate mg l at the beginning co and at a time t ct for the mass of the adsorbent m and volume of the solution ml was then determined by eq 9 9 q t o c t v m in this particular study three kinetics models were considered whose linear mathematical expressions are described in eq 10 12 pseudo first

the removal of no3 ions on the nanocomposite the following thermodynamic parameters were evaluated by making use of eq 13 15 13 k d δ h r t δ s r k d v m c o c e c e 14 δ rt ln kd 15 δgo δho tδso where kd distribution coefficient l mol 2 12 desorption of nitrate from the nanocomposite the desorption tendency of the nitrate ions after adsorbed on the nanocomposite was evaluated by adding 50 ml naoh 0 1 m into the flask containing the nitrate loaded adsorbent the resulting mixture was then ultrasonicated for 30 min with an ultrasonic vibrator finally the desorption rate d of nitrate was calculated using eq 16 16 d q i q t q i where qi and qt are nitrate concentrations at the beginning and after a contact time of t mg l 1 karimi et al 2010 2 13 regeneration study the regeneration and reusability potential of the nanocomposite was studied by loading 15 mg l of nitrate and equilibrating it for 6 h keeping all other experimental parameters at their optimum values it was then washed with 0 1 m naoh for 15 min finally the nanocomposite was rinsed for 30 min using di till it shows a similar ph value as di mukherjee and de 2014 after drying the adsorbent was reloaded again 2 14 influence of competing ions the nanocomposite s selectivity for nitrate removal with existing ions of cl hco3 clo4 so4 2 and f was investigated the prepared nanocomposite 25 mg was separately equilibrated with 25 ml of kno3 15 mg l and then mixed with 0 01 m of cl f clo4 and 0 005 m of so4 2 and hco3 for 24 h separately on a shaker the nitrate concentration was then evaluated in the filtrates 3 results and discussion 3 1 quality control all nitrate determination experiments were performed initially by calibrating the uv vis instrument baseline by measuring the absorbance of a series of standard solutions of no3 and plotting the calibration curve all slopes and intercepts of the linear plots were tested at a 95 confidence limit by applying a t test lod and loq of the method employed in the present study were determined by blank matrix blank analyses and obtained as 0 007 and 0 021 mg l respectively 3 2 characterization of al fe zr oxide nanocomposites 3 2 1 surface area the bet surface area of four protocol samples of almzr composites at different mole ratios 20 70 10 20 75 05 25 65 10 and 25 70 05 were found to be 129 68 144 89 150 58 and 296 50 m2 g respectively the result showed that all the samples have a relatively large surface area when compared with the value reported for fe3o4 al2o3 59 57 chai et al 2013 fe3o4 al2o3 63 37 jung et al 2017 al2o3 zro2 130 sarkara et al 2007 fe3o4 zro2 155 5 jiang et al 2013 and al2o3 zro2 fe3o4 199 wang et al 2014 in m2 g 1 almzr nanocomposite with a mole percent ratio of 25 70 05 exhibits the highest surface area 296 50 m2 g in this work almzr with the largest surface area 296 50 m2 g was selected for the study of nitrate removal 3 2 2 ftir analysis the nanocomposite s surface properties were investigated using ft ir and the findings are presented fig 1 the predominant bands appearing from 3411 to 3413 cm 1 are attributed to stretching vibrations of the oh groups halajnia et al 2013 and the peaks around 1628 cm 1 for both spectra correspond to h o h bending vibrations of the physically adsorbed water molecules and to the bending vibration of zr oh groups taavoni gilan et al 2010 bands exhibited at 2923 and 2853 cm 1 represent c h stretching and anti symmetrical and symmetrical h o h stretching vibrational modes long et al 2011 wang et al 2014 the peak observed at 1384 cm 1 before adsorption of nitrate might be emerged from n n stretching taavoni gilan et al 2010 teimouri et al 2016 due to surface adsorption of n2 gas used during synthesis process for preventing oxidation of magnetite after adsorption a sharp absorption band at 1384 cm 1 indicates the nitrate ions attached on the magnetic nanocomposite halajnia et al 2013 the peaks at 1163 and 1629 cm 1 correspond to bending vibration of zr oh taavoni gilan et al 2010 and the peak observed at 1065 cm 1 may correspond to al o stretching kumar et al 2011 the increased intensities of peaks at 3411 cm 1 especially after nitrate sorption indicate the increased adsorption of the interlayer water molecule and formation of hydrogen bonds between oh and no3 groups during nitrate adsorption halajnia et al 2013 teimouri et al 2016 the peak intensity at 1628 and 578 cm 1 increased due to oh bending modes of vibrational frequencies of an adsorbed intermolecular water molecule further the peaks at 579 and 475 cm 1 are assigned to zro2 and fe o stretching vibrations respectively teimouri et al 2016 jung et al 2017 3 2 3 xrd analysis the xrd patterns of almzr ternary oxide nanocomposite are demonstrated in fig 2 the strongest peaks at 2θ values of 30 14 35 57 43 20 57 17 62 79 and 74 52 could be assigned to magnetite fe3o4 jcpds 96 900 5840 no specific peaks were observed on the xrd pattern that can be associated with alumina al2o3 and zirconia zro2 this is due to low calcination temperature 60 c there is also evidence that alumina may homogeneously be dispersed into the structure of zro2 al2o3 forming an amorphous uniform bicomponent of zro2 al2o3 nanocomposites that have been coated on fe3o4 wang et al 2014 furthermore as the atomic ratio of al zr 5 1 is larger the amorphous nature of alumina also increased bartolomé et al 2016 it has been reported that t zro2 and al2o3 crystalize only at high temperatures 1100 and 1200 c respectively jogiaas et al 2020 the nanocomposite s average crystallite sizes were calculated considering the full width at half maximum fwhm of the strongest reflection peak 2θ value of 35 56 in this regard the scherer approximation was applied to calculate the particle size with the mathematical expression given in eq 17 17 d k λ β cos θ where d is the crystallite size in nm k is the shape factor constant and taken as 0 9 β is the full width at half maximum fwhm 0 8035 rad λ is the wavelength of the x ray 0 15406 nm for cu target kα radiation and θ is the bragg s angle accordingly the mean crystallite size of the nanocomposite was then found to be 2 51 nm and have a cubic structure 3 2 4 aas analysis the efficiency test of the preparation technique was made by determining the amount of each metal mole percent ratio in the selected adsorbent the result of elemental analysis is presented in table 1 the concentration of al was not determined due to the lack of oxidant nitrous oxide gas the concentrations of fe and zr in the as synthesized nanocomposite were measured by digesting 0 1 g of the selected sample with a weight percent ratio 25 70 05 the result showed that 85 30 fe and 3 20 zr were available in the sample taken while the initial precursor contains 86 63 fe and 3 28 zr this implies that the applied synthesis method was efficient 3 2 5 sem edx analysis results from sem analysis are given in fig 3 a to d a closer look at the images revealed that in accordance with their atomic number the bright phase indicates zr while alumina particles appeared as a dark phase biamino et al 2006 the elemental analysis of these micrographs fig 3 showed the presence of the three metal constituents in the ranges of 5 3 8 0 al 87 7 92 1 fe and 2 6 4 2 zr as shown in table 2 the initial percentage of the precursor metals used during synthesis were 7 66 10 26 al 82 81 89 11 fe and 3 23 6 94 zr the observed slight variation in the metals w w percent ratio distribution might be due to the dispersion technique employed in the co precipitation method 3 3 ph of point zero charge phpzc the phpzc of the magnetic nanocomposite was assessed from the plot of ph final initial vs ph final for 100 mg of the adsorbent the result is presented in fig 4 a as indicated in the graphs the value of phpzc of the adsorbent was found to be 6 8 accordingly the nanocomposite exhibits a negatively charged surface at ph greater than the phpzc and positively charged below the phpzc 3 4 effect of ph removal of inorganic and organic species from aqueous systems could depend on various experimental parameters including ph mainly because it affects the adsorbent s surface charge the degree of ionization and the speciation of adsorbate pahlavanzadeh et al 2012 the influence of ph on the adsorption of no3 by almzr was studied at a ph range set from 1 to 6 phpzc 6 8 and the result is presented in fig 4 b it was observed that during the initial steps adsorption increased up to ph 3 due to large free adsorption sites and later decreased as the ph increased due to the competition between no3 and oh for adsorption and saturation of the un adsorbed sites at ph 3 the adsorbent exhibited no3 removal capacity of 98 75 above ph 3 adsorption of nitrate dropped down as a result of this ph 3 was taken as the optimum value for consecutive experiments this result is in agreement with no3 removal by nano alumina bhatnagar and sillanpää 2011 and nitrate removal by n zero valent iron supported by polystyrene resins jiang et al 2011 3 5 effect of quantity of the adsorbent the optimum of quantity of the nanocomposite was determined and the result is presented in fig 5 from the result it is observed that 97 81 of nitrate was removed by 25 mg of the nanocomposite with further addition of the adsorbent a plateau is formed indicating that no significant increase in adsorption was taking place this might be due to the fact that surface adsorption sites became more saturated in the first rapid step and no more surface adsorption sites remained thus the nitrate ions might have started to diffuse into the bulk matrix taddesse et al 2015 elkhaleefa et al 2021 in addition the ft ir spectral analysis assured that the disappearance of adsorption frequencies of peaks at 2923 and 2853 cm 1 a slight decrease in frequencies of peaks at 3413 1629 and 579 cm 1 might be due to the exchange of oh functional groups with no3 1 during the adsorption process 3 6 batch adsorption studies and adsorption isotherms from batch experiments the adsorbent has shown 97 64 1 07 of nitrate removal capacity this value represents 28 83 0 21 mg g of the adsorbate the distribution of nitrate at equilibrium was investigated using three isotherm models accordingly langmuir isotherm values were calculated from the linear plot of log ce qe vs log ce and the values of each parameter are given in table 3 from the results it is observed that the langmuir isotherm model is in better agreement with the adsorption experiment than the freundlich isotherm from the results obtained it can be deduced that nitrate was sorbed as a monolayer coverage hokkanen et al 2014 however the values obtained from freundlich isotherm parameters such as kf 19 23 mg g indicated a significant value that implied the possibility of multilayer sorption to determine the favorability of adsorption the separation factor rl values were computed the values obtained for initial concentrations of 6 9 12 and 15 mg l were 0 951 0 928 0 906 and 0 886 respectively thus the calculated values are ranging 0 rl 1 which attributes the adsorption process was favorable at the studied parameters the decreasing trend of rl values with increasing nitrate concentration suggests that there was an increased affinity between nitrate and the adsorbent furthermore the value of 1 n or 0 234 is ranging between 0 and 1 showing surface heterogeneity zhan et al 2011 the d r model was also applied to determine the behavior of nitrate adsorption onto the almzr accordingly the value of the sorption energy e was calculated to be 4 082 kj mol 1 if the value of e lies between 1 and 8 it indicates that the adsorption process undergoes physisorption aghaii et al 2013 therefore from the three isotherm models values of the various parameters such as r2 rl 1 n n and e it was observed that the adsorption of nitrate by almzr ternary nanocomposite undergoes both physisorption and chemisorption processes 3 7 adsorption kinetics this was studied using batch experiments at initial concentrations of 5 10 and 15 mg l over 1 2 4 8 12 and 24 h at room temperature 25 c optimum adsorbent quantity and ph the kinetics model that best describes the adsorption process was selected mainly depending on the values of qe exp and qe cal and linear correlation coefficient r2 values at the studied conditions from the result the r2 values for the pseudo first order model were 0 672 0 451 and 0 681 and r2 values for the pseudo second order model were also found to be 0 991 0 997 and 0 998 respectively table 4 from the comparison of r2 values the pseudo second order model best fitted the adsorption process as all its values showed above 0 99 from this result it can be inferred that the rate determining step could be chemisorption which involves valence forces through sharing or exchange of electrons between the nanocomposite and the nitrate ions in the solution harrache et al 2019 the involvement of intraparticle diffusion in the adsorption process can be interpreted as follows a linear plot using the mathematical expression described in eq 12 indicates its involvement on the other hand if the line passes through the origin it shows that it is the only rate determining step however if the line represents multi linearity it is an indication of the complexity of the process teimouri et al 2016 the plot of intraparticle diffusion kinetic model is given in fig 6 the graph for adsorptive removal of nitrate by the nanocomposite can essentially be divided into three steps 0 1 h 1 2 h and above 2 h for the external surface adsorption or instantaneous adsorption stage the gradual adsorption the adsorption rate was limited by intra particle diffusion stage and the final equilibrium the intra particle diffusion started to cease stage respectively the result demonstrates the complexity of the process that may involve both external and intraparticle diffusion processes xu et al 2013 3 8 thermodynamics parameters at this point the adsorptive removal of no3 by the magnetic nanocomposite was investigated with 5 10 and 15 mg l concentrations of nitrate at 288 298 308 318 and 324 k the result of the experiment revealed an inverse relationship between the adsorption of nitrate and temperature this indicated that the reaction was exothermic in nature from the isotherm plots it was observed that the coefficient of determination r2 for langmuir isotherm were 0 9986 0 9991 and 0 9958 and for freundlich isotherm 0 9535 0 9621 and 0 9786 respectively at the studies concentration accordingly the former isotherm model best fitted the experimental data than the latter the apparent distribution coefficient kd values showed a decreasing trend with increasing temperature for all the three ion concentrations table 5 as a result affinity of the nanocomposite for the no3 was found to be higher at lower temperature which could be attributed to the exothermic nature of the sorption process to decide the mechanism involved in the process thermodynamic parameters such as gibbs free energy δg enthalpy change δh and entropy change δs were determined from the linear plots of lnkd vs 1 t the thermodynamic parameter results δh⁰ δs⁰ and δg⁰ calculated from linear equations of the plots for the studied concentrations showed that standard free energy δg⁰ values at the studied temperatures were negative showing that nitrate adsorption onto the adsorbent was thermodynamically feasible 3 9 desorption study evaluation of desorption of nitrate ions with sonicator and mechanical shaker was performed by placing the nitrate loaded adsorbent into 50 ml of 0 1 m naoh and equilibrated for 30 min summarized values of desorption are given in table 6 below for comparison the amount of nitrate desorbed was found to be 95 82 by sonication and 88 36 by mechanical shaker indicating that nitrate was more desorbed by sonicator than a mechanical shaker that was due to the non thermal effects of the ultrasonic field karimi et al 2010 3 10 regeneration cycle to evaluate the possibility of regenerating the nanocomposite for repeated use an experiment was performed with 15 mg l of no3 at optimum conditions for 6 h nitrate removal capacity of the adsorbent for four cycles of adsorption desorption steps is indicated in table 7 the adsorption potential of the nanocomposite after the fourth cycle has decreased from 98 58 to 73 65 and desorption has decreased from 90 17 to 61 96 this value sufficiently displayed the fairly good regeneration capacity and reusability of the adsorbent for nitrate removal using naoh as an eluent 3 11 effect of competing ions adsorptive removal potential of the nanocomposite for nitrate in a system containing cl f so4 2 hco3 and clo4 was studied at 15 mg l nitrate concentration and 25 mg of the adsorbent and the results are shown in fig 7 from this particular experimental undertaking it was found that these ions have some sort of interference with the nitrate removal by the adsorbent all the anions considered competed with the nitrate ion for the cationic sorption sites of the nanocomposite but f ion exhibited less competing tendency with nitrate for adsorption than the rest this is mainly because in most cases monovalent anions have weaker electrostatic interactions and low affinity to adsorption sites than divalent ions awual et al 2011 the influence of these ions decreased in the order of clo4 so4 2 hco3 cl f in general anions with higher charge have a higher affinity towards positively charged adsorption sites and show a higher competing tendency gogoi et al 2019 this phenomenon was also observed in this study by sulphate and hco3 which actually dissociate to co3 2 in acidic media 3 12 possible mechanism of nitrate adsorption the various experimental undertakings revealed that nitrate ions are promisingly adsorbed by the ternary nanocomposite reported in this work although it is difficult to give a single mechanism for the adsorptive removal process some plausible mechanisms are presented as follows firstly the ftir spectra showed that the synthesized nanocomposite is rich in oh groups thus the nitrate may be adsorbed by ion exchange bhatnagar et al 2010 or through hydrogen bonding teimouri et al 2016 with the hydroxyl group as described in eqs 18 and 19 respectively 18 m oh no 3 m no 3 oh 19 m oh no 3 m oh no 3 in addition to this the nitrate ions were preferably adsorbed at a ph of 3 at this ph value the oh groups found on the surface of the nanocomposite could be protonated this process favors the electrostatic attraction between the adsorbent and the nitrate eq 20 yang et al 2017 20 m oh2 no 3 m oh2 no 3 where m represents al fe and zr 3 13 comparison previous reports the removal capacity of almzr was compared with previous reports a relatively greater removal capacity of nitrate was observed in the present work compared with most reported values and could be selected for its better recyclability and environmentally friendly nature many of the reports cited in table 8 employed very high initial nitrate concentration 100 mg l the amount removed however did not correspond to the initial concentration in the present case a relatively smaller amount of nitrate 15 mg l was used however quantity of the target analyte removed was comparable with others indicating the ability of the as synthesized nanomaterial for efficient uptake of nitrate 4 conclusion al2o3 zro2 fe3o4 almzr nanocomposite was successfully synthesized characterized and applied for no3 uptake from an aqueous system the nanocomposite exhibited an appreciable surface area 296 5 m2 g during the adsorption process ph was found to affect its efficiency and the optimum ph was found to be 3 with regard to kinetics study the results revealed that pseudo second order kinetics model best fitted the adsorption process on the other hand the adsorption isotherm study revealed that both isotherm models considered in the present study can be used to describe nitrate removal the adsorptive removal capacity of the synthesized nanocomposite for nitrate 28 83 mg g is comparable with those reported in the literature moreover the influence of co existing ions was found in the order of f cl hco3 so4 2 clo 4 therefore al2o3 zro2 fe3o4 ternary nanocomposite can be suggested as a promising nanomaterial to remove of excess nitrates from an aqueous solution with better recyclability funding this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public

11717,detection of metal ions using colorimetric technique offers a key to the development of a selective methodology to the qualitative analysis of the metal ions in the current investigation the utilization of abundantly available natural resource has been done wherein a simple fruit extract from syzgium cumini in water offered a natural sensor to detect as well as eliminate fe2 ions a pollutant from potable water in the indian subcontinent the tropical fruit syzgium cumini also known as jamun in the local language is widely grown anthocyanin is the main component of syzgium cumini extract sce anthocyanin has been shown to form stable coordination complexes with heavy metal ions such as al3 sn3 and others as a result divalent transition metal ions such as cu mn co fe and ni which are possible metal contaminants in the environment were chosen for this investigation only fe2 ions generated a prussian blue coloured complex with sce and the complex could be removed with a simple centrifugation process the sensitivity of sce towards fe2 ions was found to be in the region of 1 ppm indicating that this green approach is extremely sensitive and selective graphical abstract

described in the article 1 introduction heavy metals play an adverse role in environmental pollution and their contamination is caused by a wide range of industrial agricultural and other related applications sankhla et al 2016 by contaminating drinking water and inadvertently mingling with agricultural products during transit these metals frequently cause major health problems for the general people as a result detecting and eliminating them is critical to decreasing their impact as a possible contaminant iron the fourth most prevalent element in the earth s crust is a potential contaminant that is primarily transferred to the environment by water iron levels in ground water selective regions storm water drains and industrial waste effluents are high posing substantial health risks such as liver cancer alzheimer s disease diabetes and other diseases huangfu et al 2019 the colour taste and aroma of water are affected by the presence of excess iron in water another potential consequence of iron contamination is the corrosion of water pipelines munasinghe et al 2017 hazardous metal ions are removed via a variety of processes including chromatographic separation absorption precipitation and biosorption all of which produce toxic fumes sludges or residues ivanets et al 2014 phatai et al 2014 olusola and aransiola 2015 onojake et al 2015 firstly these procedures are time consuming and necessitate the development of complex apparatus and methodology for the analysis of metal ions meeravali and jiang 2008 li e 2009 uchechukwu et al 2016 secondly the selectivity of such a procedure is a critical element that must be considered thirdly the byproduct obtained after purification will be a source of concern yu et al 2000 tengku fazli et al 2008 the detection and removal of metal ions can be accomplished using a variety of analytical techniques to name a few polarographic studies electrodialysis flotation techniques and electrochemical methods meeravali and jiang 2008 fu and wang 2011 alslaibi et al 2013 these methods are generally costly and time consuming the use of natural extracts to remove harmful metal ions is gaining popularity because it is both cost effective and environmentally friendly yue et al 2016 abdel halim et al 2019 dayanidhi and eusuff 2021a because it uses less chemicals this green technology is more lucrative and appealing metal ions are removed from industrial effluents using banana peel however metal ion adsorption was found to be less in this case onojake et al 2015 heavy metal ions have also been removed from the environment using organisms such as algae although this method is limited due to the lack of such algae in all geographical conditions park et al 2011 olusola and aransiola 2015 kursunlu et al 2019 bilgic 2021 biodegradable cellulose materials are also used as adsorbents to extract metal ions from industrial waste particularly copper bethke et al 2018 the detection of these hazardous metal pollutants employing natural materials aids in reducing their environmental impact in a sustainable manner mohajer et al 2022 in the food processing and packaging industries also natural extracts of either vegetable or fruit origin are employed as ph indicators vankar and bajpai 2010 pereira et al 2015 wardana and widyaningsih 2017 dangles and fenger 2018 when made into a film with natural or synthetic

intelligent packaging solutions wherever practical they have also been employed as a substitute for synthetic indicators singh et al 2011 yoshida et al 2014 wahyuningsih et al 2017 not only will a simple visual detection procedure help identify the presence of these metal ions but it will also help reduce the cost of analysis there are currently few visual techniques for detecting the presence of fe2 metal ions utilizing natural fruit extracts making the present invention more selective and unique natural extracts have previously been known only for their medicinal properties wardana and widyaningsih 2017 but this type of application will open up a new area of research in which these natural ingredients can be used not only to detect metal ions but also to mitigate their harmful effects by lowering the percentage of contamination or completely removing it this will largely function as a biocompatible and cleaner technique of metal detection and removal with zero by products the present study of detecting the presence of fe2 ions in water using the syzgium cumini extract is a unique one and it is done through the naked eye the method involves the usage of the sce extract to selectively identify the fe2 ions with a sensitivity of 1 ppm we have also studied the interference of other metal ions identified the optimum ph and the amount of sce extract needed the results conclude that the visual detection technique using sce extract to be a cost effective and green method for the identification of fe2 ion in ground water taking into account of all these advantages the current study reveals a simple and effective method for detecting as well as removing fe2 metal ions which is an environment pollutant fig 1 2 materials methods 2 1 chemicals reagents the chemicals

appropriate metal salts in double distilled water stock solutions of copper sulphate manganese sulphate cobalt nitrate ferrous sulphate and nickel sulphate were prepared 2 2 instrumentation uv visible double beam spectrophotometer agilent cary 60 was used for all spectrophotometric measurements of sce and fe2 sce ftir measurements were carried out with perkinelmer model spectrum two the surface morphology of fe2 sce was done with sem tescan vega 3sbh with bruker easy eds and the elemental composition was studied using sem edax measurements the profiling of sce extract was completed using hplc analysis shim pack c18 the chemical state determination was done with x ray photoelectron spectrometer xps using mono energetic al kα x rays 24 2 w 100 0 μ 45 0 55 00 ev 2 3 extraction of sce the fruits of sygzium cumini were acquired at a local market and cleaned with distilled water to eliminate surface contaminants and dust particles the fruits were then cleaned and pulverised in a juice extractor a fresh extract was obtained after filtering through a mesh having 10 μm pore size and all the process was carried out in dark the sygzium cumini extract was stored in a brown bottle under refrigeration and employed in the tests as such hplc uv visible and ftir spectroscopy were used to examine the extract 2 3 1 selectivity study the divalent metal ion solutions of various metals like cu2 ni2 fe2 co2 mn2 were prepared using double distilled water and sce was added and the visual changes were observed table 1 to 5 ml of each of the divalent metal ion solution prepared 50 μl of the sce was added and any change in colour was observed visually as well as through uv vis spectroscopy it was found that within 2 min there was a visual colour change with fe2 metal ion solution the solution changed to prussian blue colour whereas with other metal ions there was no such prominent visual change after 15 20 min the prussian blue colour precipitate settled at the bottom of the container turning the solution colourless the precipitate was filtered and the solid was analyzed by ftir spectroscopy and sem edax the selectivity towards the above mentioned ions were also studied by varying the ph of the solution 2 3 2 sensitivity study the sensitivity study was carried out by preparing various concentration of fe2 ion solution and adding the sce to the same as given in table 2 this is mainly done to determine the detection limit of fe2 ion the visual change observed were further supported by uv study 2 4 real time studies the measurement of fe2 ion content of different concentrations in water samples was studied and the results were tabulated the visual colour change of the water due to the addition of sce were observed for different concentration of fe2 subsequently the ph change was also measured 2 5 job s plots stoichiometry of the complex was investigated by continuous variation of equimolar solutions of sensors and selective ions in which the resulting absorbance was plotted against mole fraction of receptor job s plot renny et al 2013 the resultant maxima coincide with the mole fraction ratio of the receptor cation complex and therefore the stoichiometric ratios were determined as per the procedure outlined by maccarthy 1978 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of sce extraction of the sce was done by crushing the fruits of syzgium cumini which was bought fresh from the local market the uv visible spectrum of the extract showed a single sharp absorption band in the range falling from 530 to 550 nm which signifies the presence of anthocyanin wardana and widyaningsih 2017 it can be thus concluded that the sce obtained contains almost majority of anthocyanin component as generally the extract obtained from other natural sources show three absorption bands at λ max 280 330 and 530 nm which indicate the presence of other components like flavonoids and phenolic compounds giusti and wrolstad 2001 castañeda ovando et al 2009 kursunlu 2015 but in the present invention sce shows only one single absorption peak for the presence of anthocyanin fig 2 the sce extract was subjected to hplc analysis employing shim pack c18 250 x 4 6 mm 5μ the solvent system utilized was 1 acetic acid in water mobile phase a and acetonitrile mobile phase b the flow rate was 0 8 ml min and the elution pattern indicated a single component of 98 29 at retention time 19 09 six major anthocyanins pelagonidin cyanidin peonidin delphinidin petunidin malvidin were detected in sce extract so far in literature of which only one single component is identified in the present study faria et al 2011 lestario et al 2017 the variation in the profiling of sce with the previous study may be attributed to the climatic conditions geographical location and nature of the fruit varieties the lc ms study in positive ionization mode indicates the presence of molecular ion peak at m z 430 veigas et al 2007 faria et al 2011 lestario et al 2017 the hplc chromatogram and the lc ms details are attached as supplementary information further the ftir spectrum of extracted sce indicates strong peaks at 591 cm 1 1037 cm 1 1399 cm 1 1631 cm 1 2924 cm 1 3443 cm 1 similarly the sce fe2 complex shows strong peaks at 619 cm 1 831 cm 1 1094 cm 1 1638 cm 1 2998 cm 1 and 3398 cm 1 fig 3 wahyuningsih et al 2017 from the comparative ir spectrum as listed in table 3 it is understood that the functional aspects of syzgium cumini extract is not varied much further proving the formation of a coordination complex wherein the fe2 ion forms the central metal atom 3 2 sem edax xps analysis of sce fe2 complex the morphological analysis of the sce fe ii was done by sem edax the images obtained shows the structure to be a smooth amorphous and granular in nature the metallic component present were determined by edax and the results show the presence of fe as the major metallic component fig 4 e the chemical state of the sce fe2 complex was studied by xps measurements of the 2p orbitals of fe2 ions the peak position corresponding to 725 03 ev and 711 62 ev was due to the presence of fe2 2p1 2 and fe2 2p3 2 respectively yamashita and hayes 2008 li et al 2011 the peaks obtained confirmed the presence of fe2 ions in the sce fe2 complex fig 4d 3 3 determination of selectivity and sensitivity of sce towards fe2 ions the selectivity of sce was studied by comparing the effective complex formation with divalent ions like cu2 ni2 fe2 co2 mn2 it was observed that sce selectively gave a prussian blue colour precipitate instantaneously with fe2 ions and the precipitate got settled slowly within 15 20 min similar changes were not observed with all other metal ion solutions and the visual results observed are given in fig 5 g the various metal sce solutions were also subjected to absorption studies and the results were plotted fig 5a f the colour change can be very easily interpreted visually further the sensitivity of the stated visual sensing method was done by mixing sce with different concentrations of fe2 ion solutions the selectivity of syzgium cumini on cu2 ni2 fe2 co2 mn2 ions at different ph level was also studied khaodee et al 2014 mousavi et al 2016 yue et al 2016 fig 5g the results indicate that only fe2 ions were able to effectively coordinate with the sce extract at ph 7 the colour change of this extract is more predominant and selective in the case of fe2 thus paving the way for an effective efficient and also simple technique for the separation of fe2 ions the study was conducted in three different ph conditions and the solution was analyzed in a uv visible spectrometer fig 5a f effective complexation was observed only at ph 7 which was in correlation with the visual observation the ph condition essentially plays a role in the colourization of the complex formed dangles and fenger 2018 sukmaningsih et al 2018 further at acidic ph 3 and alkaline ph 12 conditions the visual colour change is not very predominant as indicated from fig 5g which strengthens the fact that this visual technique method can be used as testing method to determine the presence of fe2 ions in drinking water this is mainly due to the fact that metal complexation and π stacking interactions is effective at ph 7 leading to the formation of stable prussian blue colour complex dangles and fenger 2018 based on the absorbance study a comparative diagram is arrived for the complexation reaction of sce with different metal ions fig 5h it was observed that the detection limit was up to 1 ppm of fe2 ion solution as shown in the visual image fig 6 a the visual detection with the change in colour after adding the sce extract for very dilute concentrations like 1 10 ppm of fe2 was effective only after allowing the precipitate to settle at the bottom of the container fig 6a whereas for concentrations more than 10 ppm the complex formation fig 7 b and d could be detected immediately the corresponding uv visible absorbance study was also conducted for the sensitivity studies and the graph for the lower concentrations 1 10 ppm and higher concentrations more than 10 ppm are given in figs 6b and 7 a c respectively similarly optimization study was also done by varying the quantity of sce added to the fe2 ion solution which enabled to fix the quantity of sce extract to be added to the fe2 ion solution fig 7b the corresponding absorbance graph is also plotted fig 7a thus this visual method using sce extract offers a plausible selectivity and sensitivity in the detection of fe2 ions 3 4 real time analysis of fe2 in water samples the water used for testing was obtained from the groundwater source and it was filtered using a mesh having 10 μm pore size to remove off dust particles the fe2 ions of different concentrations were then spiked into the water samples the effective complexation of fe2 with sce was studied with varied time and concentration of fe2 and the results indicate that the reaction starts with the addition of fe2 ions to the extract and with time the sce extract can effectively remove all the fe2 ions and settles down as a precipitate leaving behind the water at the top the figure showing the settling of precipitate in real time sample study is attached in the supplementary information thus this method can be used as a convenient and easy separation technique to selectively separate the fe2 ions from the polluted water without any interference from other common polluting ions 3 5 mechanistic pathway the present simple green technique of detecting the presence of ferrous ion in aqueous medium using sce extract occurs through the formation of a prussian blue colour precipitate formation of coordination complex is a unique characteristic of transition metals and fe2 metal atom effectively coordinates with the ligand system of sce extract resulting in a stable complex el naggar et al 2021 the probable mechanism is represented in fig 8 3 6 determination of complex stoichiometry the complex stoichiometry for the formation of sce fe2 complex was found out using job s method kursunlu et al 2016 bastug et al 2020 bilgic 2021 it was done using the uv absorbance study wherein the total concentration of both sce and fe2 ions were kept constant varying only the mole fraction of both the reactants the absorbance maxima in the job s plot were obtained at 0 2 mol fraction of metal and ligand which indicates that the complex stoichiometry is 1 4 as shown in fig 9 4 conclusion the fe2 ions could be selectively detected and separated using a natural extract of syzgium cumini sce in the present methodology this detection is effective since it involves an easy visual technique for the identification process it gains significance with the fact that the method employed uses a natural extract in the visual detection process thereby making this methodology environmentally safe and robust this method avoids all hazardous chemicals for the sensing and removal of the particular metal ion under study moreover the ease with which the sce can be prepared using syzium cumini which is available in the local market make this sensing method more effective and significant especially for the rural areas with underground water contaminated with fe2 by adapting this method a common man or a woman can produce clean water free of fe2 ion for drinking purpose declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

11717,detection of metal ions using colorimetric technique offers a key to the development of a selective methodology to the qualitative analysis of the metal ions in the current investigation the utilization of abundantly available natural resource has been done wherein a simple fruit extract from syzgium cumini in water offered a natural sensor to detect as well as eliminate fe2 ions a pollutant from potable water in the indian subcontinent the tropical fruit syzgium cumini also known as jamun in the local language is widely grown anthocyanin is the main component of syzgium cumini extract sce anthocyanin has been shown to form stable coordination complexes with heavy metal ions such as al3 sn3 and others as a result divalent transition metal ions such as cu mn co fe and ni which are possible metal contaminants in the environment were chosen for this investigation only fe2 ions generated a prussian blue coloured complex with sce and the complex could be removed with a simple centrifugation process the sensitivity of sce towards fe2 ions was found to be in the region of 1 ppm indicating that this green approach is extremely sensitive and selective graphical abstract image 1 keywords syzgium cumini extract sce anthocyanin selectivity sensitivity ferrous ions detection visual detection colorimetric sensor data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction heavy metals play an adverse role in environmental pollution and their contamination is caused by a wide range of industrial agricultural and other related applications sankhla et al 2016 by contaminating drinking water and inadvertently mingling with agricultural products during transit these metals frequently cause major health problems for the general people as a result detecting and eliminating them is critical to decreasing their impact as a possible contaminant iron the fourth most prevalent element in the earth s crust is a potential contaminant that is primarily transferred to the environment by water iron levels in ground water selective regions storm water drains and industrial waste effluents are high posing substantial health risks such as liver cancer alzheimer s disease diabetes and other diseases huangfu et al 2019 the colour taste and aroma of water are affected by the presence of excess iron in water another potential consequence of iron contamination is the corrosion of water pipelines munasinghe et al 2017 hazardous metal ions are removed via a variety of processes including chromatographic separation absorption precipitation and biosorption all of which produce toxic fumes sludges or residues ivanets et al 2014 phatai et al 2014 olusola and aransiola 2015 onojake et al 2015 firstly these procedures are time consuming and necessitate the development of complex apparatus and methodology for the analysis of metal ions meeravali and jiang 2008 li e 2009 uchechukwu et al 2016 secondly the selectivity of such a procedure is a critical element that must be considered thirdly the byproduct obtained after purification will be a source of concern yu et al 2000 tengku fazli et al 2008 the detection and removal of metal ions can be accomplished using a variety of analytical techniques to name a few polarographic studies electrodialysis flotation techniques and electrochemical methods meeravali and jiang 2008 fu and wang 2011 alslaibi et al 2013 these methods are generally costly and time consuming the use of natural extracts to remove harmful metal ions is gaining popularity because it is both cost effective and environmentally friendly yue et al 2016 abdel halim et al 2019 dayanidhi and eusuff 2021a because it uses less chemicals this green technology is more lucrative and appealing metal ions are removed from industrial effluents using banana peel however metal ion adsorption was found to be less in this case onojake et al 2015 heavy metal ions have also been removed from the environment using organisms such as algae although this method is limited due to the lack of such algae in all geographical conditions park et al 2011 olusola and aransiola 2015 kursunlu et al 2019 bilgic 2021 biodegradable cellulose materials are also used as adsorbents to extract metal ions from industrial waste particularly copper bethke et al 2018 the detection of these hazardous metal pollutants employing natural materials aids in reducing their environmental impact in a sustainable manner mohajer et al 2022 in the food processing and packaging industries also natural extracts of either vegetable or fruit origin are employed as ph indicators vankar and bajpai 2010 pereira et al 2015 wardana and widyaningsih 2017 dangles and fenger 2018 when made into a film with natural or synthetic polymers these extracts work as a very good sensor for detecting the quality of food mujtaba et al 2019 vo et al 2019 these extracts have been shown to be an effective aid in the development of intelligent packaging solutions wherever practical they have also been employed as a substitute for synthetic indicators singh et al 2011 yoshida et al 2014 wahyuningsih et al 2017 not only will a simple visual detection procedure help identify the presence of these metal ions but it will also help reduce the cost of analysis there are currently few visual techniques for detecting the presence of fe2 metal ions utilizing natural fruit extracts making the present invention more selective and unique natural extracts have previously been known only for their medicinal properties wardana and widyaningsih 2017 but this type of application will open up a new area of research in which these natural ingredients can be used not only to detect metal ions but also to mitigate their harmful effects by lowering the percentage of contamination or completely removing it this will largely function as a biocompatible and cleaner technique of metal detection and removal with zero by products the present study of detecting the presence of fe2 ions in water using the syzgium cumini extract is a unique one and it is done through the naked eye the method involves the usage of the sce extract to selectively identify the fe2 ions with a sensitivity of 1 ppm we have also studied the interference of other metal ions identified the optimum ph and the amount of sce extract needed the results conclude that the visual detection technique using sce extract to be a cost effective and green method for the identification of fe2 ion in ground water taking into account of all these advantages the current study reveals a simple and effective method for detecting as well as removing fe2 metal ions which is an environment pollutant fig 1 2 materials methods 2 1 chemicals reagents the chemicals

sce was added and any change in colour was observed visually as well as through uv vis spectroscopy it was found that within 2 min there was a visual colour change with fe2 metal ion solution the solution changed to prussian blue colour whereas with other metal ions there was no such prominent visual change after 15 20 min the prussian blue colour precipitate settled at the bottom of the container turning the solution colourless the precipitate was filtered and the solid was analyzed by ftir spectroscopy and sem edax the selectivity towards the above mentioned ions were also studied

locations of 15 zoning violated areas zvas in chennai we collected 45 groundwater samples in each pre and post monsoon seasons for testing heavy metals concentration levels and compared them with the world health organization who the bureau of indian standards bis drinking water standards we surveyed 797 households in the 14 zvas and statistically analysed drinking water expenditure scientific analysis reveals that cadmium and nickel are 15 and 7 times higher than the who bis standards in nagalkeni of pammal area the analysis also shows that higher levels of concentrations of lead nickel chromium and cadmium in the groundwater in 25 13 3 and 1 locations respectively survey analysis indicates that 3 21 102 households have incurred an aggregate expenditure of 52 72 million per year on drinking water the analysis shows that each of the economically weaker lower middle and upper middle income groups spend on average 11 64 4 72 and 2 55 per cent of their daily income respectively on drinking water the study also informs that pammal is the most vulnerable area in groundwater contamination and households in ambattur area has incurred highest expenditure on drinking water the regression analysis of the data reveals that variables such as metro water income and family size are statistically significant in explaining the water expenditure the computable general equilibrium model for chennai estimates shows that the increase in water resources and economic growth under the assumption that all the households will and economically weaker sections will not contribute to investments for drinking water resources the study proposes a household right to know legislation adequate metro water supply and an incentive structured compatible land use regulation to achieve sustainable use of groundwater resources graphical abstract image 1 keywords urban land use groundwater contamination drinking water expenditure data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the normative economic theory of externality zoning states that co location of laundries and smokestacks reduces the economic output of the former activities a zoning regulation which geographically segregates firms increases the output of the laundries without reducing the output of the smokestacks bailey 1959 thus hazardous industrial activities in residential zones and the harm imposed on households should be considered by urban local bodies for making land use decisions and setting forth regulations in the design of a zoning policy owens 2013 the motive of zoning is to enhance the value of property by separation of different land uses that are mutually incompatible national academy of public administration 2003 it is also seen as a means by which existing residents control entry into their local public goods club the studies for the city of pittsburgh crecine et al 1967 rochester ny maser et al 1977 and vancouver bc mark and goldberg 1986 conclude that contrary to zoning principles nonconforming uses do not seem to have much effect on homes and thus zoning is not justified however studies by li and brown 1980 and stull 1975 have found that proximity to nonconforming uses does reduce home values the values of residential properties have dropped on average between 10 and 22 4 per cent because of the close proximity of shale gas wells to the household wells contamination of a household s water supply increases purchases of bottled water wrenn 2016 a study on the socio economic value of drinking water supply from groundwater resources indicates that households have willingness to pay 5 per cent of their disposable income for the water to avert arsenic risks in rural bangladesh khan et al 2014 moreover safe drinking water supply will reduce the cost of illness wage loss and treatment 5 million per annum for the sample household of groundwater contamination with arsenic in maner and shahpur areas in bihar india thakur and gupta 2019 this

computable general equilibrium model for chennai on sustainable water resources and economic growth and e to design incentive structured program to conserve the groundwater resources chennai is a city of 8 78 million people in south india census of india 2011 the tamil nadu and country planning act 1971 government of tamil nadu 1972 empowers chennai metropolitan development authority cmda formerly known as madras metropolitan development authority mmda a to survey chennai metropolitan planning area and prepare a survey report b to prepare a master plan and c to order other authorities to execute development plans the land use plan of chennai was enforced through the development control rules that formed as part of the first 1975 and second 2008 master plans of chennai metropolitan area cma 4 4 according to the master plans cma comprises chennai city corporation 16 municipalities 20 town panchayats and 214 villages the area is spread over 1189 km2 the second master plan of chennai states that land use for residential and industrial purposes accounts for 45 02 and 9 78 per cent respectively the chennai metropolitan water supply and sewerage board cmwssb or metro water along with the state public works department spwd irrigation empowers for mobilisation allocation and management of water resources 5 5 sholavaram red hills and chemarambakkam lakes provide drinking water to chennai city the poondi reservoir draws 12 thousand million cubic feet tmc of water under the telugu ganga project from krishna river neighbourhood state of andhra pradesh that is 400 km away from chennai similarly veeranam lake gets water from the cauvery river system through kollidam the metro water enters into contracts with farmers and extracts water from their agricultural wells in the araniar kosthalaiyar basin to augment its sources of water it also extracts water from six well fields commissioned viz minjur panjetty tamaraipakkam poondi kannigaiper and flood plains in the a k basin in addition two 100 million litres a day mld capacity desalination plants were set up at kattupalli village and at nemmeli on east coast road chennai metropolitan water supply and sewerage board 2008 the supply of water within the city is a piped network mobile supply and yard hand pump the sub urban areas largely depend on groundwater resources the metro water collects water charges of 0 80 per month from the household this is in addition to a levy of 7 per cent per year on the property value of residential buildings for water and sanitation services however the owners of residential buildings try to understate the value of the property to avoid high registration charges as well as property tax the loss of revenue to metro water results in an inefficient water supply which in turn makes majority of the households pay less by way of taxes leading to a vicious circle of water stress the cost of metro water supply was very high that is 1 05 per kilolitre in 2004 05 and 1 02 per kilolitre in 2005 06 6 6 transmission loss of 15 per cent was taken into consideration in our calculation of cost of water supply per kilolitre source cmwssb table cost of source treatment and distribution of water b e 2013 14 because of the water stress however informal water market iwm also supplies water to the households of chennai at higher prices than that of metro water it is usually in the form of a water can which costs 0 40 0 48 for 20 l 25 l and is presumed to be free from water contamination the study examines the problem of accessibility availability and affordability of drinking water to the households of groundwater contaminated zvas in chennai resulting from externality zoning and inadequate metro water in order to generate evidence on the groundwater contamination we have identified the zoning policy violated residential yellow colour and industrial pink colour areas with the help of land use maps 1973 and 2026 of chennai madras metropolitan development authority 1975 and chennai metropolitan development authority 2008 in addition google earth has helped us to identify the presence of industrial units in and around the residential zones the interactions with the households and the researchers observations regarding zoning violation and groundwater contamination have helped to collect 90 groundwater samples in 45 locations of 15 zvas in pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons the scientific results reveal that higher levels of heavy metals concentration prevail in 14 out of 15 zvas households 797 survey in 42 locations of 14 zvas indicates that they have incurred an aggregate expenditure of 52 72 million per year on drinking water we have also employed the linear regression technique to identify and analyse the determinants of the households drinking water expenditure the regression analysis shows that the coefficients of the variables income group metro water supply to household household residential status number of family members in a household and household occupational status have a highly statistically significant impact on the water expenditure the computable general equilibrium cge for chennai further estimates that the water resources will increase by three fold and overall economic growth by 2 per cent under the assumption that all the households will contribute to the investments for drinking water resources similarly the water resources will increase by two fold and overall economic growth by 1 7 per cent under the assumption that economically weaker income group will not contribute to the investments for drinking water resources the interdisciplinary study suggests a household right to know legislation regarding dissemination of information to the household on heavy metals concentration in the groundwater resources b accessibility availability and affordability of metro water supply to the household as per the norms of the bureau of indian standards and c to design incentive structured compatible land use regulation to achieve sustainable use of groundwater resources in chennai 2 material and methods advancement of technologies and pervasive subsidies will influence water use patterns for economic gross domestic product gdp and non economic ecological activities for growing population which in turn will cause water stress hence the united nations has formulated sustainable development goals bhattacharya and bundschuh 2015 india is a water stressed county and ranked 120 out of 122 on the water quality index exploitation of 690 bcm of surface water and 432 bcm of groundwater from the total useable resource of 1122 bcm central water commission 2019 has occurred in addition climate change has reduced summer monsoon precipitation by around 6 per cent 1951 2015 and the annual frequency of tropical cyclones over the north indian ocean basin groundwater resources account for 50 per cent of the urban water needs moreover 35 per cent of 6965 units of groundwater resources are over exploited critical and semi critical in india rainwater deficiency and groundwater pollution further aggravate water stress central ground water board 2021 groundwater resources stress will be hazardous to human health due to anthropogenic activities wang and wang 2016 rezaei et al 2019 aithani et al 2020 rupias et al 2021 and krishan et al 2021 thus our study focuses on scientific analysis of heavy metals concentration in the groundwater resources and its implications on households drinking water expenditure in the zoning violated areas zvas of chennai in addition it aims to identify and analyse the determinants of the households drinking water expenditure to provide incentives to the households to enhance their efforts on sustainable performance oriented resource harvest and use practices according to the köppen geiger climate classification chennai is situated under the category of aw tropical savanna climate the city lies within the temperature range of 13 9 c to 45 c with mean temperature between 24 3 c to 32 9 c and humidity of 65 84 per cent the average annual rainfall of 1200 mm 1978 2008 occurs due to the depressions in the bay of bengal and in the form of one or two cyclones the anthropogenic sources of pb in the study area of north chennai are automobile emissions and the manufacture of fertilisers batteries pigments and dyes the source of cd is the thermal power plant situated in ennore chennai kumaresan and riyazuddin 2008 the concentrations of pb and mn exceeded the permissible limits during both pre monsoon and post monsoon periods and the levels of cd and fe exceeded during the pre monsoon period only in the groundwater of the ambattur industrial estate of chennai ravichandran and jayaprakash 2011 statistical analysis of samples shows that the correlation among the metals viz cd and cr r 0 606 cd and cu r 0 601 cr and cu r 0 464 and pb and zn r 0 416 depicts their source of common origin in the south west region of the chennai kumar et al 2012 we interacted with households regarding their experiences with hazardous industrial effluents discharge and conducted on the spot observation of industrial activities 7 7 leather tanneries paints chemicals fertilizers thermal power rubber metals and automobiles in our study area the selected zvas and sample locations can be depicted in the following map map zvas sample locations heavy metals concentration higher than the who bis standards and households drinking water expenditure note zvas mogappair is part of the ambattur accordingly we collected 45 groundwater samples chakraborty and gupta 2010 8 8 each of groundwater samples has been collected in brand new tarson bottle of 50 ml capacity before collection of the sample hand pump taps of bore well were run for 2 3 min to get actual groundwater representation as recommended by central ground water board 1998 the collected sample bottles were firmly sealed they were preserved by acidifying with 2 per cent of ultra pure conc hno3 in 50 ml of sample volume this process preserves samples for a period of 6 months to 1 year in addition each acidified sample was filtered with 0 22 μm gfc filter paper method 6010 c inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry and method 6020 a inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry february 2007 u s environmental protection agency and chakraborty and gupta 2010 the concentrations of heavy metals were ascertained by using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes for post monsoon samples similarly inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms has been used for pre monsoon samples in each pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons in 45 locations of the 15 zvas for testing 9 9 the collected samples were tested at the environmental engineering lab of indian institute of technology kanpur we follow the united states environmental protection agency usepa standards and protocols the testing was done for several elements in a sample however the elements of importance cadmium cd chromium cr lead pb and nickel ni were taken into consideration to detect the effects of industrial discharge in the groundwater resources the results should be very well accepted as we ran external multi element standards along with the tested water samples as well as blanks there have been several international peer reviewed journal articles published from our lab and have been received well by the scientific community we diligently followed all the quality check and quality control protocols as per well accepted usepa protocols the test results have been analysed by comparing them with the world health organization who world health organization 2008 the bureau of indian standards bis bureau of indian standards 2012 drinking water standards 10 10 according to the bureau of indian standards bis is 10 500 2012 table 3 page 3 of indian standard drinking water specification second revision the prescribed drinking water standards for heavy metals cadmium chromium lead and nickel are similar to that of who drinking water standards see http cgwb gov in documents wq standards pdf accessed may 30 2020 heavy metals pollution index hpi edet and offiong 2002 giri and singh 2014 and principal component analysis pcas and factor and cluster analysis f cas have been used to identify the major sources of heavy metals that are dominant in the zvas nair et al 2010 the scientific analysis of the groundwater resources review of the metro water supply the master plans and initial interactions with a few of the households and observation and understanding of attributes of 14 zvas have provided us the opportunity to develop a structured questionnaire for a household survey we have visited 797 households consisting of 4528 members of the 14 zvas in chennai with a structured questionnaire and obtained voluntary on the spot oral consent for the survey the women usually will have better information regarding the mobilisation allocation and management of day to day water resources at the household levels in india hence female respondents were largely approached with the questionnaire to seek information regarding socio economic conditions family size economic status occupation duration of stay and residential occupancy water use patterns metro water supply and groundwater resources and drinking water expenditure quantity consumption and cost of water we have also had telephonic interactions with the respondents those who have voluntarily provided us with their contact numbers regarding a few clarifications on water use patterns the respondents were selected from various income groups they are of economically weaker section with less than 80 09 per month lower middle income group between 80 09 and 240 27 per month upper middle income group between 240 27 and 480 54 per month and higher income group with more than 480 54 per month we have randomly selected the respondents within the locations where water samples were collected in the 14 zvas the selection of the respondents further has been based on the researchers investigators on the spot observation regarding the attributes buildings vehicles neighbourhood and environment of the physical assets of the households in addition secondary data has been obtained regarding the number of households and population of the 14 zvas census of india 2011 we assume that a rational household will use its groundwater resources in the case of inadequate metro water supply moreover our scientific and household survey analysis reveals that the concentration of heavy metals in the groundwater of residential areas limits the freshwater resources to the households therefore the households will incur expenditure on drinking water accordingly households expenditure on bottled water 11 11 the number of people drinking bottled water was calculated by multiplying the number of households who purchase bottled water with the average size of a household in the area similarly the consumption of bottled water was calculated by multiplying the average consumption of water per person per day with the number of people drinking bottled water was calculated by multiplying the number of people drinking bottled water with the average consumption of water per person per day and the average price of bottled water per litre panta et al 2018 similarly we have also calculated the households expenditure on water purifiers per day our scientific results review of the water supply mechanism survey descriptive analysis and the drinking water expenditure have provided us with an opportunity to identify and quantify the following factors that will influence the households expenditure on bottled water and water purifiers waterexp i income groups ii metro water supply iii residential status owner or tenant iv duration of stay in the zvas v number of family members vi occupational status vii zoning violated areas and viii heavy metals concentration an a priori relationship between waterexp and each of the above factors is specified below w a t e r e x p i α 1 β 1 i

equation are derived from the above specified factors shown in table 1 below the regression analysis enables us to address the factors that impact the incidence of waterexp burden on the households the study has employed linear regression model using normal standard error and the results of the regression analysis are presented in table 1 under model i the diagnostic test namely variance inflation factor vif reveals that the average vif is 5 23 for further information see appendix a 1 variance inflation factor 12 12 our descriptive statistics indicate that the economically weaker income group incurs a higher incidence of water expenditure burden when compared to the high income group the statistics further reveal that the casual labour also has a higher incidence of water expenditure burden when compared to the respondents of self employed the high vif may be due to the fact that the higher income group and the self employed have more environmental consciousness and ability to pay and willingness to pay for drinking water on account of this it might create more impact on the dependent variable water expenditure the breusch pagan cook weisberg test reveals that the model suffers from the problem of heteroscedasticity to overcome this problem we have recalculated the results by using weighted standard error with zonal as cluster id model ii and robust standard error model iii we found that the results of model ii iii are similar descriptive statistics of the data and the correlation matrix of test of correlation significance model are presented in appendices a 2 and a 3 respectively the households expenditure on drinking water and the determinants of the waterexp further motivated us to apply policy modelling simulations to mobilise investments by metro water to augment drinking water resources we have developed a new computable general equilibrium cge for chennai its theoretical structure and data are based on global trade analysis project gtap 13 13 the standard gtap model is a multiregional multisector computable general equilibrium model assuming perfect competition and constant returns to scale the model is widely preferred for policy analysis owing to its unique capability to effectively model supply chain effects macro economic aspects economy wide equilibrium constraints linkages between different sectors and countries as well as the factor use effects of various commodities to predict economic variables like gdp productivity trade balances investments innovation consumer welfare the employment and the wages the model is also able to capture the potential substitution of one sector by another among other notable aspects it allows for a wide range of closure options including unemployment tax revenue replacement and fixed trade balance closures such models can capture inter regional and inter sectoral impacts and also the linkages between the economic agents e g households governments industries and the rest of the world framework explained by hertel 1997 and narayanan et al 2015 the cge models take in exogenous shocks based on proposed policies and then compute the potential impact on various parts of the economy based on our estimates from the survey in the zvas we came up with shocks to investment in the water sector funded by all people and then funded by all but the weaker sections of society now the variables shown in the appendix are for chennai as a whole in per centage changes resulting from the investment changes that we envisage due to our policy recommendations for further information see appendix a 7 cge modelling results for example a 1 9 per cent change in gdp means that such an increased investment in the water sector funded by all people may lead to an increase in gdp by 1 9 per cent because of the forward and backward linkages of the water sector in the economy overall investment may rise by 1 68 per cent due to the same reason propelled by expansion in different sectors exports may increase due to greater production at competitive prices of different commodities that may require water such expansion in economic activity also means greater imports and consumption pushed up further by increased disposable income and all these also lead to greater employment if the weaker sections are excluded we have the same direction of results but of lower magnitude because of the greater financial pressure on some sections of the population who may then spend relatively less than in the other scenario this model is available only at national and global levels hence we first disaggregated the io table of india into chennai and the rest of the country by using the statistical handbook of tamil nadu we further focused on the size of the water utility sector in which we have introduced taxes that were paid by private households 14 14 based on our estimates from the survey in the zvas we have assumed a all the households will contribute to the investments for drinking water resources and b the economically weaker income group will not contribute to the investments for the resources this means that on average about 4 76 per cent of the household income is collected from all people so that they can fund the development of the sector we obtained this estimate by computing the population weighted average of the share of income spent in water by different income strata in chennai overall the purpose of cge was just to illustrate the usefulness of our estimates for understanding the macroeconomic and inter sectoral impact of policies 3 results the test results of the 90 groundwater samples of both seasons in the 45 locations of the 15 zvas for which the concentrations of heavy metals are higher than the who bis drinking water standards are illustrated in fig 1 below fig 1 above reveals that at nagalkeni in pammal area the cd cadmium concentration level was found to be 15 times higher than the drinking water standards nagalkeni in pammal area and vasanthan colony in villvakkam area showed a level of ni nickel 7 times higher than the standards the pb lead level was 6 times above the standards at vasanthan colony the concentration levels of cr chromium at arkeeswarar colony pumbhakar nagar in pammal area and vasanthan colony were marginally above the drinking water standards pammal is the most vulnerable area in terms of groundwater contamination with heavy metals among the 15 zvas high level of ni was found in 4 and 8 locations in both the monsoons 15 15 no 8 songuvel street in pammal area dpt colony in ambattur area ekkaduthangal in guindy area and gandhi nagar in thiruvottiyur area and the pre monsoon 16 16 7th street arkeeswarar colony 2nd street pumbhakar nagar and 1st st adam nagar in pammal area vasantham colony in villivakkam area sivanpadai street ennore in kathivakkam area tirumurti nagar vanagaram in porur area mahakavi bharathiyar nagar in vyasarpadi area and bhartiya street in manali period respectively similarly high level of pb was found in 9 and 16 locations in both the monsoons 17 17 dpt colony in ambattur area erriya mudali street korrukupet parhasarthi street and rettai kuhi street tandiarpet washermanpet in radhakrishnanagar area voc street and anna ninaivu nagar rd in kathirvedu area royal garden katupakkam and sridevi nagar in goparasanallur area and dandisheewaram in

hind nagar in tiruvottiyur area sharma nagar in vyasarpadi area 1st street janakpuri in velacheri area golden colony in mogappair amattur area lakshmi nagar moulivakkam in gerumbakkam period respectively overall 31 out of 45 locations of the 15 zvas have registered with high levels of heavy metals for further information see map zvas sample locations heavy metals concentration higher than the who bis standards and household drinking water expenditure the high correlation with heavy metal pollution index hpi further indicates that the hazardous industrial activities in the zvas areas are responsible for the high levels of heavy metals contamination in groundwater resources monsoon rains resulted in increased water levels which led to the dilution of heavy metals concentration at several sampling locations resulting in lower hpi values however in spite of the dilution effect strong correlations were observed for cd ni cr ni pb cr and ni pb respectively hertel 1997 19 19 according to the indian meteorological department indian meteorological department 2012 2016 chennai received deficient and normal rainfall in the year 2014 during pre and post monsoon seasons respectively however the city received normal and excess rainfall in the year 2015 during the pre monsoon and post monsoon periods respectively the indian meteorological department imd also states that chennai has received normal deficient scanty rainfall during the pre and post monsoon seasons 2012 2016 except in the post monsoon period of 2015 and the pre monsoon period for further information see appendix a 4 hpi analysis the heavy metals concentration in the groundwater resources of sembiam area is within the permissible limits of the drinking water standards copper is always below detection limits in the analysed water samples according to the central ground water board fluoride beyond the permissible limit 1 5 mg litre has been observed in the wells of 16 districts in

wqoverview html accessed on 30th may 2020 for the detection of mercury special accessories are required with the analytical instruments which are beyond the available resources of the authors the concentration of heavy metals in water resources can result in behavioural learning and productivity disorders yousef et al 2013 our scientific and survey analysis reveals that the higher levels of heavy metals concentration in the groundwater resources of residential areas and inadequate metro water supply limit the accessibility availability and affordability of fresh water to the households of the zvas therefore the households have incurred expenditure on drinking water bottled water and water purifiers which is shown in fig 2 below fig 2 above shows that 2 69 861 households 21 21 we have proxied the survey data of the per centage of households who drink bottled water to the household data of population census of india 2011 for instance the household data of population census of india 2011 indicates that the total number of households in the area of ambattur is 120 248 our survey data reveals that 58 33 per cent of 60 households in ambattur have purchased drinking water accordingly 70 141 households i e 58 33 per cent of 1 20 248 households drink purchased water likewise we have estimated the total number of households that drink purchased water in the 14 zvas to be 2 69 861 in the 14 zvas have incurred a staggering aggregate expenditure of 44 70 million per year on bottled water this implies that each household s bottled water expenditure is 165 63 per year more importantly 1 04 933 households in the three highly groundwater contaminated areas viz pammal villivakkam and ambattur have incurred an aggregate expenditure of 20 27 million per year on bottled water this implies that each household s bottled water expenditure in the above three areas is 193 17 per year the expenditure on water purifiers indicates that 51 241 households 22 22 we have proxied the survey data of the per centage of households who used water purifiers to the household s data of population census of india 2011 for instance the household s data of population census of india 2011 indicates that the total number of households in the area of goparasanallur is 15 541 our survey data reveals that 26 67 per cent of 45 households in goparasanallur have used water purifiers accordingly 4145 households i e 26 67 per cent of 15541 households have used water purifiers likewise we have estimated the total number of households that uses water purifiers in the 14 zvas to be 51 241 have incurred a staggering aggregate expenditure of 8 02 million per year in the 14 zvas for further information see map zvas sample locations heavy metals concentration higher than the who bis standards and household drinking water expenditure and appendix a 5 bottled water and water purifiers expenditure by the households in the zvas the figure further reveals that 70 141 households have incurred an aggregate expenditure of 16 40 million out of 52 72 million per year on drinking water in the area of ambattur this implies that each household s drinking water expenditure in the area is 233 82 per year accordingly each household in ambattur area has incurred the highest expenditure on drinking water among the 14 zvas the groundwater in pammal area is contaminated with all metals namely cd cr ni and pb 23 23 the area was initially land use map 1973 residential in nature however over the decades it has been clustered with leather units and tanneries paints and chemicals units residential expansion is also evidenced around the units chromium from leather tanning often enters into air soil water and food the pathways into the human body are ingestion inhalation and dermal through contaminated water however the survey data reveals that only 48 33 per cent of the households in pammal buy bottled water 63 33 per cent of the households have stated that they are unable to use their groundwater resources for drinking purpose due to contamination of water however only 1 67 per cent of households used the resources for drinking purpose the lower middle income group and the economically weaker income group of the area account for 43 33 per cent and 23 33 per cent of the household respectively therefore a majority of the household in pammal do not buy bottled water and rely on boiling and filtering the contaminated groundwater through cloth for drinking purposes villivakam area s groundwater resources have been found to be contaminated with cr ni and pb 24 24 the integral coach factory divisions viz lime furnishing grit blasting and painting and shell carry out works for train coaches the survey analysis indicates that 65 per cent of the households in villivakam purchase bottled water 36 67 per cent of the household have stated that they are not using groundwater resources for drinking purpose because of higher levels of heavy metals concentration in this area the lower middle and upper middle income groups account for 71 67 per cent and 28 33 per cent of the households respectively similarly groundwater resources in ambattur area have been found to be contaminated with ni and pb 25 25 ambattur industrial estate and small industry development corporation sidco industrial estate have a plethora of manufacturing industries the industries discharge their effluents openly and directly into the sewer lines the water from the sewerage having a high content of heavy metals infiltrates and contaminates the groundwater industrial and municipal effluents contaminate two water bodies viz ambattur eri and chithu oragadam lakes household work in these industries according to the survey data 58 33 per cent of households buy bottled water 56 67 per cent of the households have informed us that their groundwater resources are not useful for drinking purpose due to contamination with heavy metals in this area the lower middle and upper middle income groups account for 35 per cent and 40 per cent of the households respectively in contrast to the above areas kathirvedu s groundwater resources have been found to be contaminated with pb but the survey data reveals that 46 per cent of the household have stated that their groundwater resources are useful for drinking water accordingly 22 per cent of the household only buy bottled water worth only 0 12 million per year the results of regression analysis model i model ii and model iii are shown in table 2 below table 2 above indicates that the f statistic is highly significant this implies that all the independent variables together have a significant impact on the dependent variable drinking water expenditure waterexp we tried testing the robustness of these results by modifying the specifications and estimation methods but the results did not change qualitatively and even in terms of magnitudes and significance from the results the coefficients of the variables namely income groups incomewi incomlmi incomumi metro water supply to households mtrowatr household s residential status ownrtnan number of family members in a household famlymem and household s occupational status selfempl have a statistically significant impact on waterexp similarly the coefficients of the variables corresponding to duration of stay by the households in the zvas staydura and household s occupational status reguempl have a statistically significant impact on waterexp the coefficient of the variable mtrowatr is negatively related to waterexp and its coefficient is statistically significant the supply of sufficient metro water to the households minimises their expenditure incurred on drinking water the survey data indicates that on average 66 25 per cent of households receive metro water for less than 3 h per day on average only 22 33 per cent of households receive metro water for 3 h per day it also reveals that 8 78 per cent of households did not have a metro water connection and only 2 63 per cent of households receive 24 h metro water supply the data further states that 296 out of 797 that is 37 14 per cent of the sample households did not use either water purifiers or bottled water for further information see appendix a 6 socio economic and water use pattern of household of 14 zvas the coefficient of the variable ownrtnan is negative and statistically significant this implies that the households who reside in their own houses will enhance their efforts for the management of freshwater resources as compared to base households who reside as tenants 26 26 if a household is a tenant of a house he can choose to move to a non zva ceteris paribus accordingly the tenant can avoid expenditure on bottled water accordingly they will try to minimise their expenditure on drinking water our survey data reveals that 62 36 per cent of the households reside in their own houses the data analysis also indicates that 216 households out of 797 households have been residing for more than 30 years in the zvas the households who have no information regarding the concentration of heavy metals in their groundwater resources and are unable to pay for drinking water account for 42 59 per cent of the 216 households the adults exposure to contaminated groundwater resources for more than 30 years will results in skin disorders united states environmental protection agency 2002 according to a study 6500 households of pammal have spent 13 75 million per year on treating waterborne diseases and have cumulatively suffered 4075 years of life lived with disability kumar 2016 the study also finds that waterborne diseases have a negative impact on marriage prospects employment in fashion industries and social confidence of the households similarly the coefficients of income groups incomewi incomlmi incomumi are negative and statistically significant this shows that the economically weaker income group spend the least on drinking water and the lower middle income and upper middle income group spend lesser on drinking water than base higher income group hence the incidence of waterexp burden will be high on economically weaker income group the survey data indicates that each of the economically weaker lower middle and upper middle income groups spend on average 11 64 per cent 4 72 per cent and 2 55 per cent of their daily income respectively on drinking water it reveals that 69 17 per cent of economically weaker income group and 41 10 per cent of lower middle income group have not purchased drinking water it further states that 30 53 per cent of 16 69 per cent economically weaker income group 58 89 per cent of 52 20 per cent lower middle income group 79 91 per cent of 27 47 per cent of upper middle income group and 89 66 per cent of 3 64 per cent higher income group of the total sample size use bottled water as well as water purifiers however water purifiers were not used by the economically weaker income group the coefficient of the variables of occupational status selfempl is positive and statistically significant the disposable income of self employed will be high and hence they will incur higher expenditure on drinking water than base pensioners the survey data shows that the respondents occupational status reveals that casual labour accounts for 78 94 per cent of the economically weaker income group however self employment accounts for 68 97 per cent of the higher income group similarly regular employment accounts for 47 36 per cent and 52 51 per cent of the lower middle income and upper middle income groups respectively accordingly the coefficient of the variables of occupational status reguempl is positive and weakly statistically significant our scientific analysis indicates higher levels of concentration of heavy metals in the 14 zvas accordingly one zva is not different from other zvas regarding groundwater contamination maybe because of this reason the heavy metals concentration hvymetal variable is not showing significance the computable general equilibrium cge model for chennai estimates a three fold increase in the water utility sector and a 2 per cent boost to the gdp of the region via forward and backward linkages under the assumption that all households will contribute to the investments for drinking water resources the results are promising because a the households contribute to the investments a minimum amount that is equal to the expenditure incurred by them on drinking water and b the households will experience much greater economic benefits similarly under the assumption that economically weaker income group will not contribute to the investments for the resources the model estimates a two fold increase in the water utility sector and a 1 7 per cent boost to gdp for further information see appendix a 7 cge modelling results 4 discussion 4 1 household right to know legislation the incidence of water expenditure burden to the household of economically weaker and lower middle income groups is higher than that of upper middle and high income groups in addition little information regarding the high levels of heavy metals concentration in the groundwater resources inability to pay for bottled water and water purifiers and inadequate supply of metro water leads to the use of contaminated groundwater by a few of the households of economically weaker and lower middle income groups of the zvas hence the public agencies in chennai should formulate a laboratory test manual to measure the heavy metals concentration in the groundwater resources in the zvas the firms also should report to the agencies regarding the information on the release of the treated effluents this information will help to monitor the firms compliance with zoning and environmental rules and regulations and create awareness among the households on firms behaviour moreover pervasive subsidies ineffective ex ante and ex post systems and absence of water trade least cost technologies for conservation and mitigation of groundwater contamination and social security impose damages on human beings and ecology therefore there is a need to generate and disseminate information on heavy metals concentration in groundwater resources the information will provide incentives to the households to enhance their efforts on sustainable performance oriented resource harvest and use practices secure themselves from waterborne diseases boycott the polluted goods and services and fulfil their fundamental duty 51a g of constitution of india to conserve groundwater resources thus there is a need for household right to know legislation 4 2 accessibility availability and affordability of the metro water metro water mobilises fresh water from surface ground private agricultural wells desalination of sea water and interstate water agreements the freshwater supply to households is limited to a few hours daily or on alternative days or once in three days or once in a week 27 27 according to the chennai metropolitan development authority cmda the targeted water supply in 2011 was 1165 mld 938 mld and 762 mld for households under scenarios i city 150 lpcd municipality 125 lpcd town panchayat 100 lpcd and village punchayat 80 lpcd ii city 120 lpcd municipality 100 lpcd town panchayat 80 lpcd and village punchayat 70 lpcd and iii city 100 lpcd municipality 75 lpcd town panchayat 60 lpcd and village punchayat 60 lpcd respectively see table no 7 07 estimates of water requirements p 168 chapter vii infrastructure volume iii second master plan cmda our study indicated that among the zvas households of pammal and ambattur areas are the most vulnerable and highest in terms of heavy metals concentration in groundwater and drinking water expenditure respectively the data bottled water analysis also reveals that on average a household is willing to pay for freshwater a minimum of amount 0 016 per litre the cge model for chennai estimates also highlights a three fold increase in the water utility sector under the assumption that all the households will contribute to the investments for drinking water resources our regression analysis further reveals that the supply of sufficient metro water that is 150 200 lpcd bureau of indian standards 2010 2007 1998 1993 28 28 according to the bis is 1172 1993 reaffirmed in 1998 2007 a minimum water supply of 150 200 l per capita per day lpcd should be provided for domestic consumption in cities with full flushing systems code of basic requirements for water supply drainage and sanitation 4th revision new delhi december 2010 p 1 2 see https rspublication com ajscs jan17 5 pdf accessed on 28th may 2020 according to the cmwssb it is able to supply around 108 lpcd to the households minimises their expenditure incurred on drinking water a standard greywater system at the household levels in israel has reduced water stress anat et al 2016 metro water and state public works department irrigation should enhance their joint efforts by adopting state of the art methods to harvest water at maximum sustainable yield within the territorial jurisdiction of chennai in addition an establishment of water trade between metro water and farmers will provide incentives to collect water user charges at the true price and farmers will adopt technologies for water conservation respectively our survey reveals that the upper middle and high income groups account for 31 11 per cent of the total respondents and they have the ability to pay for freshwater at its true price the metro water needs to provide water 150 200 lpcd to the lower middle income group at subsidised rates and waive charges for the economically weaker income groups the demand for water by these income groups over and above the bis norm can attract chargers at its true price this will in turn provide incentives to the households to enhance their efforts on sustainable performance oriented resource harvest and use practices 4 3 design of incentive structured compatible land use regulation the hazardous industrial units should pay for their past pollution united nations 1993 29 29 article 253 read with entry 13 of ul constitution of india empowers the parliament to enact environmental legislation to implement india s international obligations and also any decision made at international conventions such as un earth summits and wto agreements the polluter pays principle 16 agenda 21 of the un conference on environment and development 1992 makes a case for polluting industrial units shall pay for their past pollution accordingly the supreme court of india has pronounced the order an industry may set up etp now but it is liable for its past pollution vellore citizens welfare forum vs union of india and others w p no 914 1991 in the sc panta 2004 p 262 the government of india also established national green tribunals under the ngt act 2010 to provide remedial measures to victims of environmental pollution moreover the indian government has initiated smart cities scheme to enhance the quality of life of its citizens given the socio economic conditions groundwater contamination with heavy metals and the water stress and scarcity in chennai necessitates legalisation of economic freedom accordingly our empirical study on chennai suggests that the polluting industrial units in zvas should pay for their past pollution a contributing to the cost of cleaning up industrial waste b providing reverse osmosis systems c reimbursing the health care costs d paying damage compensation and e supplying adequate drinking water to the households in the zvas in addition awareness activities among the industrialists regarding the adaptation of sustainable development oriented production practices bali et al 2019 that improve the quality of life in the city are needed two decades of techno economic intensive efforts of the state industry and community have mitigated negative externalities in the bitterfeld of germany sandra 2017 accordingly there is a need for to design incentive structured compatible land use regulation for firm household state interactions to achieve sustainable use of groundwater resources in chennai 5 conclusion scientific analysis shows that the groundwater resources in the 15 zvas except sembiam area have been contaminated with high levels of heavy metals metro water supply to the household in the 14 zvas is inadequate this has resulted in a staggering expenditure of 52 72 million per year on drinking water incurred by 3 21 102 households of the areas the survey analysis reveals that the incidence of water expenditure burden is high on lower income households a few per centage of these households have neither used a water purifier nor incurred expenditure on bottled water due to their inability to pay moreover they have little information regarding the concentration of heavy metals in their groundwater resources hence such households implicitly meet their demand supply gap of metro water with contaminated groundwater therefore these households will experience mortality and morbidity costs which will have a negative impact on their social and professional life in the long run the linear regression analysis also shows that a few of the independent variables have a statistically significant impact on the drinking water expenditure incurred by the household thus there is a need to generate and disseminate knowledge on heavy metals concentration in the groundwater resources and supply of metro water as per the bis norm to the households the computable general equilibrium cge model for chennai estimates that the water utility sector can increase its output and boost the gdp of the region via forward and backward linkages under the assumption that all the households will and economically weaker income group will not contribute to the investments to develop water resources hence water trade least cost technologies for water conservation and mitigation of groundwater contamination and collection of water user charges at its true price will provide incentives to the households to enhance their efforts on sustainable performance oriented resource harvest and use practices overall the study highlights household vulnerability from incompatible land use with the application of scientific and economic methods to generate knowledge on heavy metals concentration in groundwater resources household socio economic factors household drinking water expenditure and determinants of water expenditure the knowledge generated will helps us to design incentive structured compatible land use regulation that promotes sustainable use of groundwater resources in chennai the study has not considered the use patterns of water resources in non zoning violated areas value of life in zoning violated areas and governance aspects of water resources conservation moreover our survey has not collected data on water conservation education status and property value reduction thus we plan to work on integrated water resources use patterns of firm household state needs wants and challenges from a bio economy perspective to achieve sustainable development goals our study data set further motivates us to carry out a full fledged cge model for higher and lower policy simulations at local state national and international levels we also explore the possibility of initiating a firm household state interactive program on sensitivity awareness and practice oriented conservation of water resources funding this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial or not for profit sectors however we have

11718,india as the largest user of groundwater in the world faces the risk of resources depletion and degradation the study focuses on groundwater degradation and drinking water expenditure in 45 locations of 15 zoning violated areas zvas in chennai we collected 45 groundwater samples in each pre and post monsoon seasons for testing heavy metals concentration levels and compared them with the world health organization who the bureau of indian standards bis drinking water standards we surveyed 797 households in the 14 zvas and statistically analysed drinking water expenditure scientific analysis reveals that cadmium and nickel are 15 and 7 times higher than the who bis standards in nagalkeni of pammal area the analysis also shows that higher levels of concentrations of lead nickel chromium and cadmium in the groundwater in 25 13 3 and 1 locations respectively survey analysis indicates that 3 21 102 households have incurred an aggregate expenditure of 52 72 million per year on drinking water the analysis shows that each of the economically weaker lower middle and upper middle income groups spend on average 11 64 4 72 and 2 55 per cent of their daily income respectively on drinking water the study also informs that pammal is the most vulnerable area in groundwater contamination and households in ambattur area has incurred highest expenditure on drinking water the regression analysis of the data reveals that variables such as metro water income and family size are statistically significant in explaining the water expenditure the computable general equilibrium model for chennai estimates shows that the increase in water resources and economic growth under the assumption that all the households will and economically weaker sections will not contribute to investments for drinking water resources the study proposes a household right to know legislation adequate metro water supply and an incentive structured compatible land use regulation to achieve sustainable use of groundwater resources graphical abstract image 1 keywords urban land use groundwater contamination drinking water expenditure data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the normative economic theory of externality zoning states that co location of laundries and smokestacks reduces the economic output of the former activities a zoning regulation which geographically segregates firms increases the output of the laundries without reducing the output of the smokestacks bailey 1959 thus hazardous industrial activities in residential zones and the harm imposed on households should be considered by urban local bodies for making land use decisions and setting forth regulations in the design of a zoning policy owens 2013 the motive of zoning is to enhance the value of property by separation of different land uses that are mutually incompatible national academy of public administration 2003 it is also seen as a means by which existing residents control entry into their local public goods club the studies for the city of pittsburgh crecine et al 1967 rochester ny maser et al 1977 and vancouver bc mark and goldberg 1986 conclude that contrary to zoning principles nonconforming uses do not seem to have much effect on homes and thus zoning is not justified however studies by li and brown 1980 and stull 1975 have found that proximity to nonconforming uses does reduce home values the values of residential properties have dropped on average between 10 and 22 4 per cent because of the close proximity of shale gas wells to the household wells contamination of a household s water supply increases purchases of bottled water wrenn 2016 a study on the socio economic value of drinking water supply from groundwater resources indicates that households have willingness to pay 5 per cent of their disposable income for the water to avert arsenic risks in rural bangladesh khan et al 2014 moreover safe drinking water supply will reduce the cost of illness wage loss and treatment 5 million per annum for the sample household of groundwater contamination with arsenic in maner and shahpur areas in bihar india thakur and gupta 2019 this literature offers an insight that the price effects of zoning policy between cities and the types of zoning examined one can raise a question how did the nonconforming use get into the residential neighbourhood in the first place fischel 1998 in india the delhi industrial pollution 1985 1 1 the supreme court of india in its order may 7 2004 to the state government of delhi to stop the hazardous industrial activities in the residential zones within six months m c mehta v union of india wp 4677 1985 supreme court of india case and a scientific study central ground water board central pollution control board 2000 2 2 the study report indicates that cadmium chromium lead and nickel were present in the groundwater resources of shahdara the water blocks of alipur mehrauli and city s resources were contaminated with chromium lead and nickel the najafgarh block was contaminated with lead have motivated us to carry out interdisciplinary and evidence based policy research on groundwater contamination and household bottled water expenditure in the zoning violated areas zvas a pilot study panta et al 2018 indicates that among the megacities chennai is the most vulnerable city in terms of heavy metals concentration in the groundwater inadequate metro water supply and households expenditure on bottled water 3 3 cd cadmium concentration at chrompet chennai was 17 times higher than the who drinking water standards similarly the level of cr chromium at new town in yelhanka bangalore was three times higher than the drinking water standards moreover the level of pb lead at nagalkeni in chennai and 2nd chowrasta balanagar in hyderabad was 18 and 16 times respectively higher than the drinking water standards the level of ni nickel was 10 16 and 19 times above the drinking water standards at ambattur chennai patan cehrvu hyderabad and balanagar hyderabad respectively the survey data indicates that the households in the zvas of bangalore chennai and hyderabad have spent 0 93 million 22 75 million and 4 15 million per year respectively on bottled water accordingly the present study focuses on chennai a to examine heavy metals concentration in the groundwater in pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons b to calculate the households drinking water bottled water and water purifiers expenditure c to identify and analyse the determinants of the water expenditure d to estimate computable general equilibrium model for chennai on sustainable water resources and economic growth and e to design incentive structured program to conserve the groundwater resources chennai is a city of 8 78 million people in south india census of india 2011 the tamil nadu and country planning act 1971 government of tamil nadu 1972 empowers chennai metropolitan development authority cmda formerly known as madras metropolitan development authority mmda a to survey chennai metropolitan planning area and prepare a survey report b to prepare a master plan and c to order other authorities to execute development plans the land use plan of chennai was enforced through the development control rules that formed as part of the first 1975 and second 2008 master plans of chennai metropolitan area cma 4 4 according to the master plans cma comprises chennai city corporation 16 municipalities 20 town panchayats and 214 villages the area is spread over 1189 km2 the second master plan of chennai states that land use for residential and industrial purposes accounts for 45 02 and 9 78 per cent respectively the chennai metropolitan water supply and sewerage board cmwssb or metro water along with the state public works department spwd irrigation empowers for mobilisation allocation and management of water resources 5 5 sholavaram red hills and chemarambakkam lakes provide drinking water to chennai city the poondi reservoir draws 12 thousand million cubic feet tmc of water under the telugu ganga project from krishna river neighbourhood state of andhra pradesh that is 400 km away from chennai similarly veeranam lake gets water from the cauvery river system through kollidam the metro water enters into contracts with farmers and extracts water from their agricultural wells in the araniar kosthalaiyar basin to augment its sources of water it also extracts water from six well fields commissioned viz minjur panjetty tamaraipakkam poondi kannigaiper and flood plains in the a k basin in addition two 100 million litres a day mld capacity desalination plants were set up at kattupalli village and at nemmeli on east coast road chennai metropolitan water supply and sewerage board 2008 the supply of water within the city is a piped network mobile supply and yard hand pump the sub urban areas largely depend on groundwater resources the metro water collects water charges of 0 80 per month from the household this is in addition to a levy of 7 per cent per year on the property value of residential buildings for water and sanitation services however the owners of residential buildings try to understate the value of the property to avoid high registration charges as well as property tax the loss of revenue to metro water results in an inefficient water supply which in turn makes majority of the households pay less by way of taxes leading to a vicious circle of water stress the cost of metro water supply was very high that is 1 05 per kilolitre in 2004 05 and 1 02 per kilolitre in 2005 06 6 6 transmission loss of 15 per cent was taken into consideration in our calculation of cost of water supply per kilolitre source cmwssb table cost of source treatment and distribution of water b e 2013 14 because of the water stress however informal water market iwm also supplies water to the households of chennai at higher prices than that of metro water it is usually in the form of a water can which costs 0 40 0 48 for 20 l 25 l and is presumed to be free from water contamination the study examines the problem of accessibility availability and affordability of drinking water to the households of groundwater contaminated zvas in chennai resulting from externality zoning and inadequate metro water in order to generate evidence on the groundwater contamination we have identified the zoning policy violated residential yellow colour and industrial pink colour areas with the help of land use maps 1973 and 2026 of chennai madras metropolitan development authority 1975 and chennai metropolitan development authority 2008 in addition google earth has helped us to identify the presence of industrial units in and around the residential zones the interactions with the households and the researchers observations regarding zoning violation and groundwater contamination have helped to collect 90 groundwater samples in 45 locations of 15 zvas in pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons the scientific results reveal that higher levels of heavy metals concentration prevail in 14 out of 15 zvas households 797 survey in 42 locations of 14 zvas indicates that they have incurred an aggregate expenditure of 52 72 million per year on drinking water we have also employed the linear regression technique to identify and analyse the determinants of the households drinking water expenditure the regression analysis shows that the coefficients of the variables income group metro water supply to household household residential status number of family members in a household and household occupational status have a highly statistically significant impact on the water expenditure the computable general equilibrium cge for chennai further estimates that the water resources will increase by three fold and overall economic growth by 2 per cent under the assumption that all the households will contribute to the investments for drinking water resources similarly the water resources will increase by two fold and overall economic growth by 1 7 per cent under the assumption that economically weaker income group will not contribute to the investments for drinking water resources the interdisciplinary study suggests a household right to know legislation regarding dissemination of information to the household on heavy metals concentration in the groundwater resources b accessibility availability and affordability of metro water supply to the household as per the norms of the bureau of indian standards and c to design incentive structured compatible land use regulation to achieve sustainable use of groundwater resources in chennai 2 material and methods advancement of technologies and pervasive subsidies will influence water use patterns for economic gross domestic product gdp and non economic ecological activities for growing population which in turn will cause water stress hence the united nations has formulated sustainable development goals bhattacharya and bundschuh 2015 india is a water stressed county and ranked 120 out of 122 on the water quality index exploitation of 690 bcm of surface water and 432 bcm of groundwater from the total useable resource of 1122 bcm central water commission 2019 has occurred in addition climate change has reduced summer monsoon precipitation by around 6 per cent 1951 2015 and the annual frequency of tropical cyclones over the north indian ocean basin groundwater resources account for 50 per cent of the urban water needs moreover 35 per cent of 6965 units of groundwater resources are over exploited critical and semi critical in india rainwater deficiency and groundwater pollution further aggravate water stress central ground water board 2021 groundwater resources stress will be hazardous to human health due to anthropogenic activities wang and wang 2016 rezaei et al 2019 aithani et al 2020 rupias et al 2021 and krishan et al 2021 thus our study focuses on scientific analysis of heavy metals concentration in the groundwater resources and its implications on households drinking water expenditure in the zoning violated areas zvas of chennai in addition it aims to identify and analyse the determinants of the households drinking water expenditure to provide incentives to the households to enhance their efforts on sustainable performance oriented resource harvest and use practices according to the köppen geiger climate classification chennai is situated under the category of aw tropical savanna climate the city lies within the temperature range of 13 9 c to 45 c with mean temperature between 24 3 c to 32 9 c and humidity of 65 84 per cent the average annual rainfall of 1200 mm 1978 2008 occurs due to the depressions in the bay of bengal and in the form of one or two cyclones the anthropogenic sources of pb in the study area of north chennai are automobile emissions and the manufacture of fertilisers batteries pigments and dyes the source of cd is the thermal power plant situated in ennore chennai kumaresan and riyazuddin 2008 the concentrations of pb and mn exceeded the permissible limits during both pre monsoon and post monsoon periods and the levels of cd and fe exceeded during the pre monsoon period only in the groundwater of the ambattur industrial estate of chennai ravichandran and jayaprakash 2011 statistical analysis of samples shows that the correlation among the metals viz cd and cr r 0 606 cd and cu r 0 601 cr and cu r 0 464 and pb and zn r 0 416 depicts their source of common origin in the south west region of the chennai kumar et al 2012 we interacted with households regarding their experiences with hazardous industrial effluents discharge and conducted on the spot observation of industrial activities 7 7 leather tanneries paints chemicals fertilizers thermal power rubber metals and automobiles in our study area the selected zvas and sample locations can be depicted in the following map map zvas sample locations heavy metals concentration higher than the who bis standards and households drinking water expenditure note zvas mogappair is part of the ambattur accordingly we collected 45 groundwater samples chakraborty and gupta 2010 8 8 each of groundwater samples has been collected in brand new tarson bottle of 50 ml capacity before collection of the sample hand pump taps of bore well were run for 2 3 min to get actual groundwater representation as recommended by central ground water board 1998 the collected sample bottles were firmly sealed they were preserved by acidifying with 2 per cent of ultra pure conc hno3 in 50 ml of sample volume this process preserves samples for a period of 6 months to 1 year in addition each acidified sample was filtered with 0 22 μm gfc filter paper method 6010 c inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry and method 6020 a inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry february 2007 u s environmental protection agency and chakraborty and gupta 2010 the concentrations of heavy metals were ascertained by using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes for post monsoon samples similarly inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms has been used for pre monsoon samples in each pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons in 45 locations of the 15 zvas for testing 9 9 the collected samples were tested at the environmental engineering lab of indian institute of technology kanpur we follow the united states environmental protection agency usepa standards and protocols the testing was done for several elements in a sample however the elements of importance cadmium cd chromium cr lead pb and nickel ni were taken into consideration to detect the effects of industrial discharge in the groundwater resources the results should be very well accepted as we ran external multi element standards along with the tested water samples as well as blanks there have been several international peer reviewed journal articles published from our lab and have been received well by the scientific community we diligently followed all the quality check and quality control protocols as per well accepted usepa protocols the test results have been analysed by comparing them with the world health organization who world health organization 2008 the bureau of indian standards bis bureau of indian standards 2012 drinking water standards 10 10 according to the bureau of indian standards bis is 10 500 2012 table 3 page 3 of indian standard drinking water specification second revision the prescribed drinking water standards for heavy metals cadmium chromium lead and nickel are similar to that of who drinking water standards see http cgwb gov in documents wq standards pdf accessed may 30 2020 heavy metals pollution index hpi edet and offiong 2002 giri and singh 2014 and principal component analysis pcas and factor and cluster analysis f cas have been used to identify the major sources of heavy metals that are dominant in the zvas nair et al 2010 the scientific analysis of the groundwater resources review of the metro water supply the master plans and initial interactions with a few of the households and observation and understanding of attributes of 14 zvas have provided us the opportunity to develop a structured questionnaire for a household survey we have visited 797 households consisting of 4528 members of the 14 zvas in chennai with a structured questionnaire and obtained voluntary on the spot oral consent for the survey the women usually will have better information regarding the mobilisation allocation and management of day to day water resources at the household levels in india hence female respondents were largely approached with the questionnaire to seek information regarding socio economic conditions family size economic status occupation duration of stay and residential occupancy water use patterns metro water supply and groundwater resources and drinking water expenditure quantity consumption and cost of water we have also had telephonic interactions with the respondents those who have voluntarily provided us with their contact numbers regarding a few clarifications on water use patterns the respondents were selected from various income groups they are of economically weaker section with less than 80 09 per month lower middle income group between 80 09 and 240 27 per month upper middle income group between 240 27 and 480 54 per month and higher income group with more than 480 54 per month we have randomly selected the respondents within the locations where water samples were collected in the 14 zvas the selection of the respondents further has been based on the researchers investigators on the spot observation regarding the attributes buildings vehicles neighbourhood and environment of the physical assets of the households in addition secondary data has been obtained regarding the number of households and population of the 14 zvas census of india 2011 we assume that a rational household will use its groundwater resources in the case of inadequate metro water supply moreover our scientific and household survey analysis reveals that the concentration of heavy metals in the groundwater of residential areas limits the freshwater resources to the households therefore the households will incur expenditure on drinking water accordingly households expenditure on bottled water 11 11 the number of people drinking bottled water was calculated by multiplying the number of households who purchase bottled water with the average size of a household in the area similarly the consumption of bottled water was calculated by multiplying the average consumption of water per person per day with the number of people drinking bottled water was calculated by multiplying the number of people drinking bottled water with the average consumption of water per person per day and the average price of bottled water per litre panta et al 2018 similarly we have also calculated the households expenditure on water purifiers per day our scientific results review of the water supply mechanism survey descriptive analysis and the drinking water expenditure have provided us with an opportunity to identify and quantify the following factors that will influence the households expenditure on bottled water and water purifiers waterexp i income groups ii metro water supply iii residential status owner or tenant iv duration of stay in the zvas v number of family members vi occupational status vii zoning violated areas and viii heavy metals concentration an a priori relationship between waterexp and each of the above factors is specified below w a t e r e x p i α 1 β 1 i

equation are derived from the above specified factors shown in table 1 below the regression analysis enables us to address the factors that impact the incidence of waterexp burden on the households the study has employed linear regression model using normal standard error and the results of the regression analysis are presented in table 1 under model i the diagnostic test namely variance inflation factor vif reveals that the average vif is 5 23 for further information see appendix a 1 variance inflation factor 12 12 our descriptive statistics indicate that the economically weaker income group incurs a higher incidence of water expenditure burden when compared to the high income group the statistics further reveal that the casual labour also has a higher incidence of water expenditure burden when compared to the respondents of self employed the high vif may be due to the fact that the higher income group and the self employed have more environmental consciousness and ability to pay and willingness to pay for drinking water on account of this it might create more impact on the dependent variable water expenditure the breusch pagan cook weisberg test reveals that the model suffers from the problem of heteroscedasticity to overcome this problem we have recalculated the results by using weighted standard error with zonal as cluster id model ii and robust standard error model iii we found that the results of model ii iii are similar descriptive statistics of the data and the correlation matrix of test of correlation significance model are presented in appendices a 2 and a 3 respectively the households expenditure on drinking water and the determinants of the waterexp further motivated us to apply policy modelling simulations to mobilise investments by metro water to augment drinking water resources we have developed a new computable general equilibrium cge for chennai its theoretical structure and data are based on global trade analysis project gtap 13 13 the standard gtap model is a multiregional multisector computable general equilibrium model assuming perfect competition and constant returns to scale the model is widely preferred for policy analysis owing to its unique capability to effectively model supply chain effects macro economic aspects economy wide equilibrium constraints linkages between different sectors and countries as well as the factor use effects of various commodities to predict economic variables like gdp productivity trade balances investments innovation consumer welfare the employment and the wages the model is also able to capture the potential substitution of one sector by another among other notable aspects it allows for a wide range of closure options including unemployment tax revenue replacement and fixed trade balance closures such models can capture inter regional and inter sectoral impacts and also the linkages between the economic agents e g households governments industries and the rest of the world framework explained by hertel 1997 and narayanan et al 2015 the cge models take in exogenous shocks based on proposed policies and then compute the potential impact on various parts of the economy based on our estimates from the survey in the zvas we came up with shocks to investment in the water sector funded by all people and then funded by all but the weaker sections of society now the variables shown in the appendix are for chennai as a whole in per centage changes resulting from the investment changes that we envisage due to our policy recommendations for further information see appendix a 7 cge modelling results for example a 1 9 per cent change in gdp means that such an increased investment in the water sector funded by all people may lead to an increase in gdp by 1 9 per cent because of the forward and backward linkages of the water sector in the economy overall investment may rise by 1 68 per cent due to the same reason propelled by expansion in different sectors exports may increase due to greater production at competitive prices of different commodities that may require water such expansion in economic activity also means greater imports and consumption pushed up further by increased disposable income and all these also lead to greater employment if the weaker sections are excluded we have the same direction of results but of lower magnitude because of the greater financial pressure on some sections of the population who may then spend relatively less than in the other scenario this model is available only at national and global levels hence we first disaggregated the io table of india into chennai and the rest of the country by using the statistical handbook of tamil nadu we further focused on the size of the water utility sector in which we have introduced taxes that were paid by private households 14 14 based on our estimates from the survey in the zvas we have assumed a all the households will contribute to the investments for drinking water resources and b the economically weaker income group will not contribute to the investments for the resources this means that on average about 4 76 per cent of the household income is collected from all people so that they can fund the development of the sector we obtained this estimate by computing the population weighted average of the share of income spent in water by different income strata in chennai overall the purpose of cge was just to illustrate the usefulness of our estimates for understanding the macroeconomic and inter sectoral impact of policies 3 results the test results of the 90 groundwater samples of both seasons in the 45 locations of the 15 zvas for which the concentrations of heavy metals are higher than the who bis drinking water standards are illustrated in fig 1 below fig 1 above reveals that at nagalkeni in pammal area the cd cadmium concentration level was found to be 15 times higher than the drinking water standards nagalkeni in pammal area and vasanthan colony in villvakkam area showed a level of ni nickel 7 times higher than the standards the pb lead level was 6 times above the standards at vasanthan colony the concentration levels of cr chromium at arkeeswarar colony pumbhakar nagar in pammal area and vasanthan colony were marginally above the drinking water standards pammal is the most vulnerable area in terms of groundwater contamination with heavy metals among the 15 zvas high level of ni was found in 4 and 8 locations in both the monsoons 15 15 no 8 songuvel street in pammal area dpt colony in ambattur area ekkaduthangal in guindy area and gandhi nagar in thiruvottiyur area and the pre monsoon 16 16 7th street arkeeswarar colony 2nd street pumbhakar nagar and 1st st adam nagar in pammal area vasantham colony in villivakkam area sivanpadai street ennore in kathivakkam area tirumurti nagar vanagaram in porur area mahakavi bharathiyar nagar in vyasarpadi area and bhartiya street in manali period respectively similarly high level of pb was found in 9 and 16 locations in both the monsoons 17 17 dpt colony in ambattur area erriya mudali street korrukupet parhasarthi street and rettai kuhi street tandiarpet washermanpet in radhakrishnanagar area voc street and anna ninaivu nagar rd in kathirvedu area royal garden katupakkam and sridevi nagar in goparasanallur area and dandisheewaram in

hind nagar in tiruvottiyur area sharma nagar in vyasarpadi area 1st street janakpuri in velacheri area golden colony in mogappair amattur area lakshmi nagar moulivakkam in gerumbakkam period respectively overall 31 out of 45 locations of the 15 zvas have registered with high levels of heavy metals for further information see map zvas sample locations heavy metals concentration higher than the who bis standards and household drinking water expenditure the high correlation with heavy metal pollution index hpi further indicates that the hazardous industrial activities in the zvas areas are responsible for the high levels of heavy metals contamination in groundwater resources monsoon rains resulted in increased water levels which led to the dilution of heavy metals concentration at several sampling locations resulting in lower hpi values however in spite of the dilution effect strong correlations were observed for cd ni cr ni pb cr and ni pb respectively hertel 1997 19 19 according to the indian meteorological department indian meteorological department 2012 2016 chennai received deficient and normal rainfall in the year 2014 during pre and post monsoon seasons respectively however the city received normal and excess rainfall in the year 2015 during the pre monsoon and post monsoon periods respectively the indian meteorological department imd also states that chennai has received normal deficient scanty rainfall during the pre and post monsoon seasons 2012 2016 except in the post monsoon period of 2015 and the pre monsoon period for further information see appendix a 4 hpi analysis the heavy metals concentration in the groundwater resources of sembiam area is within the permissible limits of the drinking water standards copper is always below detection limits in the analysed water samples according to the central ground water board fluoride beyond the permissible limit 1 5 mg litre has been observed in the wells of 16 districts in tamil nadu 20 20 coimbatore dharmapuri dindigul erode karur krishnagiri namakkal perambalur puddukotai ramnathpuram salem shivaganga theni thiruvannamalai vellore and virudunagar http cgwb gov in wqoverview html accessed on 30th may 2020 for the detection of mercury special accessories are required with the analytical instruments which are beyond the available resources of the authors the concentration of heavy metals in water resources can result in behavioural learning and productivity disorders yousef et al 2013 our scientific and survey analysis reveals that the higher levels of heavy metals concentration in the groundwater resources of residential areas and inadequate metro water supply limit the accessibility availability and affordability of fresh water to the households of the zvas therefore the households have incurred expenditure on drinking water bottled water and water purifiers which is shown in fig 2 below fig 2 above shows that 2 69 861 households 21 21 we have proxied the survey data of the per centage of households who drink bottled water to the household data of population census of india 2011 for instance the household data of population census of india 2011 indicates that the total number of households in the area of ambattur is 120 248 our survey data reveals that 58 33 per cent of 60 households in ambattur have purchased drinking water accordingly 70 141 households i e 58 33 per cent of 1 20 248 households drink purchased water likewise we have estimated the total number of households that drink purchased water in the 14 zvas to be 2 69 861 in the 14 zvas have incurred a staggering aggregate expenditure of 44 70 million per year on bottled water this implies that each household s bottled water expenditure is 165 63 per year more importantly 1 04 933 households in the three highly groundwater contaminated areas viz pammal villivakkam and ambattur have incurred an aggregate expenditure of 20 27 million per year on bottled water this implies that each household s bottled water expenditure in the above three areas is 193 17 per year the expenditure on water purifiers indicates that 51 241 households 22 22 we have proxied the survey data of the per centage of households who used water purifiers to the household s data of population census of india 2011 for instance the household s data of population census of india 2011 indicates that the total number of households in the area of goparasanallur is 15 541 our survey data reveals that 26 67 per cent of 45 households in goparasanallur have used water purifiers accordingly 4145 households i e 26 67 per cent of 15541 households have used water purifiers likewise we have estimated the total number of households that uses water purifiers in the 14 zvas to be 51 241 have incurred a staggering aggregate expenditure of 8 02 million per year in the 14 zvas for further information see map zvas sample locations heavy metals concentration higher than the who bis standards and household drinking water expenditure and appendix a 5 bottled water and water purifiers expenditure by the households in the zvas the figure further reveals that 70 141 households have incurred an aggregate expenditure of 16 40 million out of 52 72 million per year on drinking water in the area of ambattur this implies that each household s drinking water expenditure in the area is 233 82 per year accordingly each household in ambattur area has incurred the highest expenditure on drinking water among the 14 zvas the groundwater in pammal area is contaminated with all metals namely cd cr ni and pb 23 23 the area was initially land use map 1973 residential in nature however over the decades it has been clustered with leather units and tanneries paints and chemicals units residential expansion is also evidenced around the units chromium from leather tanning often enters into air soil water and food the pathways into the human body are ingestion inhalation and dermal through contaminated water however the survey data reveals that only 48 33 per cent of the households in pammal buy bottled water 63 33 per cent of the households have stated that they are unable to use their groundwater resources for drinking purpose due to contamination of water however only 1 67 per cent of households used the resources for drinking purpose the lower middle income group and the economically weaker income group of the area account for 43 33 per cent and 23 33 per cent of the household respectively therefore a majority of the household in pammal do not buy bottled water and rely on boiling and filtering the contaminated groundwater through cloth for drinking purposes villivakam area s groundwater resources have been found to be contaminated with cr ni and pb 24 24 the integral coach factory divisions viz lime furnishing grit blasting and painting and shell carry out works for train coaches the survey analysis indicates that 65 per cent of the households in villivakam purchase bottled water 36 67 per cent of the household have stated that they are not using groundwater resources for drinking purpose because of higher levels of heavy metals concentration in this area the lower middle and upper middle income groups account for 71 67 per cent and 28 33 per cent of the households respectively similarly groundwater resources in ambattur area have been found to be contaminated with ni and pb 25 25 ambattur industrial estate and small industry development corporation sidco industrial estate have a plethora of manufacturing industries the industries discharge their effluents openly and directly into the sewer lines the water from the sewerage having a high content of heavy metals infiltrates and contaminates the groundwater industrial and municipal effluents contaminate two water bodies viz ambattur eri and chithu oragadam lakes household work in these industries according to the survey data 58 33 per cent of households buy bottled water 56 67 per cent of the households have informed us that their groundwater resources are not useful for drinking purpose due to contamination with heavy metals in this area the lower middle and upper middle income groups account for 35 per cent and 40 per cent of the households respectively in contrast to the above areas kathirvedu s groundwater resources have been found to be contaminated with pb but the survey data reveals that 46 per cent of the household have stated that their groundwater resources are useful for drinking water accordingly 22 per cent of the household only buy bottled water worth only 0 12 million per year the results of regression analysis model i model ii and model iii are shown in table 2 below table 2 above indicates that the f statistic is highly significant this implies that all the independent variables together have a significant impact on the dependent variable drinking water expenditure waterexp we tried testing the robustness of these results by modifying the specifications and estimation methods but the results did not change qualitatively and even in terms of magnitudes and significance from the results the coefficients of the variables namely income groups incomewi incomlmi incomumi metro water supply to households mtrowatr household s residential status ownrtnan number of family members in a household famlymem and household s occupational status selfempl have a statistically significant impact on waterexp similarly the coefficients of the variables corresponding to duration of stay by the households in the zvas staydura and household s occupational status reguempl have a statistically significant impact on waterexp the coefficient of the variable mtrowatr is negatively related to waterexp and its coefficient is statistically significant the supply of sufficient metro water to the households minimises their expenditure incurred on drinking water the survey data indicates that on average 66 25 per cent of households receive metro water for less than 3 h per day on average only 22 33 per cent of households receive metro water for 3 h per day it also reveals that 8 78 per cent of households did not have a metro water connection and only 2 63 per cent of households receive 24 h metro water supply the data further states that 296 out of 797 that is 37 14 per cent of the sample households did not use either water purifiers or bottled water for further information see appendix a 6 socio economic and water use pattern of household of 14 zvas the coefficient of the variable ownrtnan is negative and statistically significant this implies that the households who reside in their own houses will enhance their efforts for the management of freshwater resources as compared to base households who reside as tenants 26 26 if a household is a tenant of a house he can choose to move to a non zva ceteris paribus accordingly the tenant can avoid expenditure on bottled water accordingly they will try to minimise their expenditure on drinking water our survey data reveals that 62 36 per cent of the households reside in their own houses the data analysis also indicates that 216 households out of 797 households have been residing for more than 30 years in the zvas the households who have no information regarding the concentration of heavy metals in their groundwater resources and are unable to pay for drinking water account for 42 59 per cent of the 216 households the adults exposure to contaminated groundwater resources for more than 30 years will results in skin disorders united states environmental protection agency 2002 according to a study 6500 households of pammal have spent 13 75 million per year on treating waterborne diseases and have cumulatively suffered 4075 years of life lived with disability kumar 2016 the study also finds that waterborne diseases have a negative impact on marriage prospects employment in fashion industries and social confidence of the households similarly the coefficients of income groups incomewi incomlmi incomumi are negative and statistically significant this shows that the economically weaker income group spend the least on drinking water and the lower middle income and upper middle income group spend lesser on drinking water than base higher income group hence the incidence of waterexp burden will be high on economically weaker income group the survey data indicates that each of the economically weaker lower middle and upper middle income groups spend on average 11 64 per cent 4 72 per cent and 2 55 per cent of their daily income respectively on drinking water it reveals that 69 17 per cent of economically weaker income group and 41 10 per cent of lower middle income group have not purchased drinking water it further states that 30 53 per cent of 16 69 per cent economically weaker income group 58 89 per cent of 52 20 per cent lower middle income group 79 91 per cent of 27 47 per cent of upper middle income group and 89 66 per cent of 3 64 per cent higher income group of the total sample size use bottled water as well as water purifiers however water purifiers were not used by the economically weaker income group the coefficient of the variables of occupational status selfempl is positive and statistically significant the disposable income of self employed will be high and hence they will incur higher expenditure on drinking water than base pensioners the survey data shows that the respondents occupational status reveals that casual labour accounts for 78 94 per cent of the economically weaker income group however self employment accounts for 68 97 per cent of the higher income group similarly regular employment accounts for 47 36 per cent and 52 51 per cent of the lower middle income and upper middle income groups respectively accordingly the coefficient of the variables of occupational status reguempl is positive and weakly statistically significant our scientific analysis indicates higher levels of concentration of heavy metals in the 14 zvas accordingly one zva is not different from other zvas regarding groundwater contamination maybe because of this reason the heavy metals concentration hvymetal variable is not showing significance the computable general equilibrium cge model for chennai estimates a three fold increase in the water utility sector and a 2 per cent boost to the gdp of the region via forward and backward linkages under the assumption that all households will contribute to the investments for drinking water resources the results are promising because a the households contribute to the investments a minimum amount that is equal to the expenditure incurred by them on drinking water and b the households will experience much greater economic benefits similarly under the assumption that economically weaker income group will not contribute to the investments for the resources the model estimates a two fold increase in the water utility sector and a 1 7 per cent boost to gdp for further information see appendix a 7 cge modelling results 4 discussion 4 1 household right to know legislation the incidence of water expenditure burden to the household of economically weaker and lower middle income groups is higher than that of upper middle and high income groups in addition little information regarding the high levels of heavy metals concentration in the groundwater resources inability to pay for bottled water and water purifiers and inadequate supply of metro water leads to the use of contaminated groundwater by a few of the households of economically weaker and lower middle income groups of the zvas hence the public agencies in chennai should formulate a laboratory test manual to measure the heavy metals concentration in the groundwater resources in the zvas the firms also should report to the agencies regarding the information on the release of the treated effluents this information will help to monitor the firms compliance with zoning and environmental rules and regulations and create awareness among the households on firms behaviour moreover pervasive subsidies ineffective ex ante and ex post systems and absence of water trade least cost technologies for conservation and mitigation of groundwater contamination and social security impose damages on human beings and ecology therefore there is a need to generate and disseminate information on heavy metals concentration in groundwater resources the information will provide incentives to the households to enhance their efforts on sustainable performance oriented resource harvest and use practices secure themselves from waterborne diseases boycott the polluted goods and services and fulfil their fundamental duty 51a g of constitution of india to conserve groundwater resources thus there is a need for household right to know legislation 4 2 accessibility availability and affordability of the metro water metro water mobilises fresh water from surface ground private agricultural wells desalination of sea water and interstate water agreements the freshwater supply to households is limited to a few hours daily or on alternative days or once in three days or once in a week 27 27 according to the chennai metropolitan development authority cmda the targeted water supply in 2011 was 1165 mld 938 mld and 762 mld for households under scenarios i city 150 lpcd municipality 125 lpcd town panchayat 100 lpcd and village punchayat 80 lpcd ii city 120 lpcd municipality 100 lpcd town panchayat 80 lpcd and village punchayat 70 lpcd and iii city 100 lpcd municipality 75 lpcd town panchayat 60 lpcd and village punchayat 60 lpcd respectively see table no 7 07 estimates of water requirements p 168 chapter vii infrastructure volume iii second master plan cmda our study indicated that among the zvas households of pammal and ambattur areas are the most vulnerable and highest in terms of heavy metals concentration in groundwater and drinking water expenditure respectively the data bottled water analysis also reveals that on average a household is willing to pay for freshwater a minimum of amount 0 016 per litre the cge model for chennai estimates also highlights a three fold increase in the water utility sector under the assumption that all the households will contribute to the investments for drinking water resources our regression analysis further reveals that the supply of sufficient metro water that is 150 200 lpcd bureau of indian standards 2010 2007 1998 1993 28 28 according to the bis is 1172 1993 reaffirmed in 1998 2007 a minimum water supply of 150 200 l per capita per day lpcd should be provided for domestic consumption in cities with full flushing systems code of basic requirements for water supply drainage and sanitation 4th revision new delhi december 2010 p 1 2 see https rspublication com ajscs jan17 5 pdf accessed on 28th may 2020 according to the cmwssb it is able to supply around 108 lpcd to the households minimises their expenditure incurred on drinking water a standard greywater system at the household levels in israel has reduced water stress anat et al 2016 metro water and state public works department irrigation should enhance their joint efforts by adopting state of the art methods to harvest water at maximum sustainable yield within the territorial jurisdiction of chennai in addition an establishment of water trade between metro water and farmers will provide incentives to collect water user charges at the true price and farmers will adopt technologies for water conservation respectively our survey reveals that the upper middle and high income groups account for 31 11 per cent of the total respondents and they have the ability to pay for freshwater at its true price the metro water needs to provide water 150 200 lpcd to the lower middle income group at subsidised rates and waive charges for the economically weaker income groups the demand for water by these income groups over and above the bis norm can attract chargers at its true price this will in turn provide incentives to the households to enhance their efforts on sustainable performance oriented resource harvest and use practices 4 3 design of incentive structured compatible land use regulation the hazardous industrial units should pay for their past pollution united nations 1993 29 29 article 253 read with entry 13 of ul constitution of india empowers the parliament to enact environmental legislation to implement india s international obligations and also any decision made at international conventions such as un earth summits and wto agreements the polluter pays principle 16 agenda 21 of the un conference on environment and development 1992 makes a case for polluting industrial units shall pay for their past pollution accordingly the supreme court of india has pronounced the order an industry may set up etp now but it is liable for its past pollution vellore citizens welfare forum vs union of india and others w p no 914 1991 in the sc panta 2004 p 262 the government of india also established national green tribunals under the ngt act 2010 to provide remedial measures to victims of environmental pollution moreover the indian government has initiated smart cities scheme to enhance the quality of life of its citizens given the socio economic conditions groundwater contamination with heavy metals and the water stress and scarcity in chennai necessitates legalisation of economic freedom accordingly our empirical study on chennai suggests that the polluting industrial units in zvas should pay for their past pollution a contributing to the cost of cleaning up industrial waste b providing reverse osmosis systems c reimbursing the health care costs d paying damage compensation and e supplying adequate drinking water to the households in the zvas in addition awareness activities among the industrialists regarding the adaptation of sustainable development oriented production practices bali et al 2019 that improve the quality of life in the city are needed two decades of techno economic intensive efforts of the state industry and community have mitigated negative externalities in the bitterfeld of germany sandra 2017 accordingly there is a need for to design incentive structured compatible land use regulation for firm household state interactions to achieve sustainable use of groundwater resources in chennai 5 conclusion scientific analysis shows that the groundwater resources in the 15 zvas except sembiam area have been contaminated with high levels of heavy metals metro water supply to the household in the 14 zvas is inadequate this has resulted in a staggering expenditure of 52 72 million per year on drinking water incurred by 3 21 102 households of the areas the survey analysis reveals that the incidence of water expenditure burden is high on lower income households a few per centage of these households have neither used a water purifier nor incurred expenditure on bottled water due to their inability to pay moreover they have little information regarding the concentration of heavy metals in their groundwater resources hence such households implicitly meet their demand supply gap of metro water with contaminated groundwater therefore these households will experience mortality and morbidity costs which will have a negative impact on their social and professional life in the long run the linear regression analysis also shows that a few of the independent variables have a statistically significant impact on the drinking water expenditure incurred by the household thus there is a need to generate and disseminate knowledge on heavy metals concentration in the groundwater resources and supply of metro water as per the bis norm to the households the computable general equilibrium cge model for chennai estimates that the water utility sector can increase its output and boost the gdp of the region via forward and backward linkages under the assumption that all the households will and economically weaker income group will not contribute to the investments to develop water resources hence water trade least cost technologies for water conservation and mitigation of groundwater contamination and collection of water user charges at its true price will provide incentives to the households to enhance their efforts on sustainable performance oriented resource harvest and use practices overall the study highlights household vulnerability from incompatible land use with the application of scientific and economic methods to generate knowledge on heavy metals concentration in groundwater resources household socio economic factors household drinking water expenditure and determinants of water expenditure the knowledge generated will helps us to design incentive structured compatible land use regulation that promotes sustainable use of groundwater resources in chennai the study has not considered the use patterns of water resources in non zoning violated areas value of life in zoning violated areas and governance aspects of water resources conservation moreover our survey has not collected data on water conservation education status and property value reduction thus we plan to work on integrated water resources use patterns of firm household state needs wants and challenges from a bio economy perspective to achieve sustainable development goals our study data set further motivates us to carry out a full fledged cge model for higher and lower policy simulations at local state national and international levels we also explore the possibility of initiating a firm household state interactive program on sensitivity awareness and practice oriented conservation of water resources funding this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial or not for profit sectors however we have

11719,twenty six groundwater samples from the dug well aquifer were collected during april 2021 from the chachro sub district sindh pakistan to know the hydrogeochemical characteristics and groundwater quality for domestic and agricultural purpose multivariate statistical chloro alkaline indices result and scatter plots confirm the ion exchange process in the study region the gibbs diagram indicated that rock weathering and evaporation were significant processes that control groundwater chemistry piper and chada s diagram suggested that groundwater was na k cl so4 2 type and suggested that alkali exceeds alkaline earth metals and strong acidic exceeds weak acidic anions pca and correlation coefficient reveal that tds ec mg 2 na cl so4 2 were positively correlated and similar is confirmed through hca the statistical results reveal the dominant decreasing order amongst the cations na ca 2 mg 2 k and in anions cl hco3 so4 based on the dwqi 50 were unsuitable for drinking wilcox and usslh diagram reveal that most samples clustered in very high salinity and very high sodium water type were not suitable for agriculture use sodium absorption ratio sar kelly s

statistical analysis 3 3 1 principal components analysis pca pca is a statistical approach used to decrease the size of multi index information howladar et al 2021 khuhawar et al 2019 the analytical data obtained for 26 samples collected randomly were used for pca table 5 it is a statistical technique applied to decrease the magnitude of the multi index data set eleven parameters were used and three components were recognised with eigenvalues 1 the cumulative of the three principal components was 79 01 pc 1 has a 51 19 percentage of variance tds ec na ca k mg cl and so4 strongly correlate fig 7 positive loading of na reveals the silicate mineral weathering and ion exchange processes in groundwater of dug well aquifer pc 2 corresponded for variance 12 76 and hco3 indicated strong

reveals that k have a strong positive association 0 780 3 3 2 correlation matrix and data analysis tds and ec show a strong correlation among main cations calcium magnesium sodium and anions chlorides sulfate 0 833 0 916 0 994 and 0 922 0 794 respectively as shown in table 4 hco3 shows a very weak correlation with tds ec anions and cations mg and ca show strong correlation with each other and with na cl so4 2 0 866 0 878 and 0 787 0 914 and 0 838 0 767 and 0 760 respectively na shows strong correlation with ec tds mg2 ca2 cl so4 2 and weak correlation with k and hco3 0 994 0 994 0 878 0 787 0 985 0 770 and 0 325 0 078 respectively k shows a strong correlation with so4 2 0 695 hco3 and no3 show a very weak correlation with all parameters so4 2 show strong correlation with ec tds mg2 ca2 na

factors add salinity to groundwater bashir et al 2017 nesrine et al 2015 moderate to the poor association between calcium and sulfate specifies that dissolution of gypsum was not evident instead the elevated level of ca2 may be the ion exchange or carbonate weathering bashir et al 2017 x zhang et al 2014 positive association of sodium with cl 0 985 so4 0 775 and mg 0 878 indicate that na is supplied from a silicate weathering source other than halite dissolution table 4 3 3 3 cluster analysis clustering is a statistical approach that facilitates the grouping of similar locations in various clusters based on distance criteria that characterise the parameters to be classified khuhawar et al 2019 the clustering method was used on 26 dug well samples to examine a cluster of a like sample locations distribution of current study area results of clustering of sample location indicate that three clusters are formed fig 8 and each cluster is further classified into sub clusters cluster 1a is consists of 09 samples 1 15 23 5 22 3 6 10 and 18 cluster 1 b comprises 03 samples 4 25 and 20 group 2a is based on 8 samples 2 11 19 7 8 13 9 and 21 and 2 b on 03 samples 12 14 16 cluster 3a comprises 02 samples 17 26 and 3 b on 01 samples 3 4 rock water interaction 3 4 1 silicate weathering among hydrogeochemical reactions the ion exchange direct and reverse chemical processes govern groundwater quality mostly hydro geochemistry assessment is preferred by plotting to scatter plots and ionic ratios mgbenu and egbueri 2019 the forward ion exchange reaction suggests the releasing of na by removing cations like ca 2 and mg 2 while reverse ion exchange indicates replacement of ca 2 and mg 2 to na usually from clay mineral surface within aquifers howladar et al 2021 toolabi et al 2021 bivariate diagram between na against cl fig 9 a suggests the existence of ion exchange chemical reaction within groundwater egbueri 2019 generally the sodium to chlorine proportion is roughly equivalent to 1 when evaporite dissolution would be an individual source of na fig 9b endorsed the input of silicate weathering and ion exchange e g albite dissolution equation 2 might be accountable for the rise of na in groundwater chen et al 2019 mgbenu and egbueri 2019 talib et al 2019 results show that 50 sample has na cl ratio 1 and the remaining 50 samples have a ratio 1 indicating the presence of ion exchange process barzegar et al 2019 mgbenu and egbueri 2019 however concentration na ion more than ca 2 and mg 2 confirms that the forward ion exchange silicate weathering process remains a crucial source of na ion in groundwater the forward ion exchange process increases na ion concentration while reverse ion exchange increases ca 2 ion by reducing na ion in groundwater among the major cations sodium is dominant obtained from weathering of silicate and halite dissolution talib et al 2019 bivariate diagrams between ca 2 mg 2 and na against hco3 ions concentration meq l were plotted fig 9c and d fig 9c revealed that most samples fall below the equiline in the forward ion exchange field fig 9d indicated that most samples clustered below equiline suggesting essential ionic concentration supply from the carbonate weathering process egbueri 2019 furthermore the result verifies that the concentration of hco3 more than so4 2 and it confirms the dominance of silicate weathering egbueri 2019 thakur et al 2021 fig 10 a and b demonstrates the bivariate plot of ca 2 against hco3 and so4 2 and reveals that samples clustered below and above equiline suggesting that the silicate and carbonate weathering process plays a significant role in controlling the groundwater chemistry if silicate weathering is a major supplier of na then the most abundant anion should be hco3 and excess concentration of hco3 among anions validates this statement equation 02 however the exceeding na in the groundwater cation exchange process may also be liable

dissolution the co3 and so4 2 dissolution input is demonstrated by the bivariate plot between ca 2 mg 2 versus so4 2 hco3 fig 10d carbonate dissolution indicated if samples laying on 1 1 of ca 2 mg 2 and so4 2 hco3 then sulfate the main contributor of ca 2 mg 2 and so4 2 in groundwater expression 4 5 whereas if water samples fall above the equiline line demonstrate then the dissolution of carbonates has less input of ca 2 and mg 2 3 4 2 ion exchange chloro alkaline indices cai 1 and cai 11 suggested by schoeller 1965 gives detailed knowledge about the ion exchange between groundwater and aquifers that have major impacts on water chemistry and its assessment chen et al 2019 liu et al 2020 talib et al 2019 chloro alkaline indices area is computed from the following mathematical

10c that more than 50 of samples have cai negative values revealing that forward ion exchange remained a significant process equation 7 however reverse ion exchange has taken a significant part in the major change in cation as shown in fig 10f in addition to this influence of silicate weathering and dissolution of carbonate is also demonstrated ca 2 na against mg 2 na diagram fig 11 a and ca 2 na against hco 3 na graph fig 11b the ca 2 na against mg 2 na diagram illustrates that silicate weathering and evaporate dissolution are key sources of mg 2 whereas most of the samples gathered in and

parameters by producing scatter graphs of major cations and anions concentration the piper graph comprises one diamond shape graph and two ternary diagrams the diamond shape graph indicates that almost all samples indicate the nacl type water cl is dominant for the anion triangle than so4 2 and hco3 co3 anions cation ternary graph reveals that na ion was prevalent and anion graph indicates the dominance of cl ion in the groundwater of the research area results of the research area suggested that mostly nacl type water was leading with na and cl type species fig 13a the chadha diagram was applied to expose the geochemistry of the study area better fig 13b the groundwater samples were divided into eight different groups in the chadha diagram the present results showed all samples

agriculture use awais et al 2016 results reveal that 50 of sample locations were good to doubtful and 50 of samples were unsuitable for agriculture use an elevated level of na in the chachro sub

3 5 2 residual sodium carbonate rsc rsc is determined as a hazard of carbonate bicarbonate in water quality used for agriculture the result of the rsc for the chachro sub district varies from 31 49 to 10 32 the results of rsc indicates that 92 31 of samples were suitable and 7 69 of sample locations were unsuitable for agriculture purposes table 6 rsc ve amount reveals the elevated level of na ion through replacing ca 2 mg 2 through precipitate ca 2 as carbon dioxide leaving na as leading cation moreover rsc ve indicates the enhanced ca 2 mg 2 concentration due to bicarbonate dissociation to

who 2011 the lowest conductivity tds concentration was noted at sample station 12 and the highest concentrations were detected at sample station no 24 the excess salinity level throughout the study area contributes to mineral dissolution salts and groundwater evaporation howladar et al 2021 talib et al 2019 ca 2 mg 2 concentration varied b w 36 288 17 272 mg l respectively having mean values 117 923 108 192 mg l 92 31 and 96 15 of the study area sample locations for ca 2 and mg 2 were within the prescribed limit 200 and 150 mg l who 2011 fig 4 a b sodium and potassium ion concentration ranges from 420 to 3280 9 5 101 mg l having mean concentration 1588 269 25 72 mg l the dissolution of na and k bearing sediments of aquifer leads to elevated concentrations talib et al 2019 the spatial distribution map of na k indicates that almost all samples stations had a higher concentration of na ion fig 4c than the 200 mg l who 2011 guideline while 96 15 of samples locations of the study area have an excess level of k ions fig 4d than recommended values 12 mg l of who 2011 statistical analysis of hydrogeochemical factors reveals that the concentration levels with decreasing cations were as

2011 the excess level of cl and so4 2 may result from the dissolution of evaporite sediments present in the aquifer talib et al 2019 the no3 n concentration varied b w 6 66 117 13 mg l having an average concentration of 32 18 mg l lateral distribution map of nitrate fig 5d reveals that 92 31 of sample locations have higher nitrate values than the prescribed limit 10 mg l who 2011 statistical

dwqi results were found from 133 44 to 637 39 the 04 15 38 sample was found in poor dwqi ranges from 100 200 and 09 34 62 samples were in very poor water category dwqi ranges from 200 to 300 and 13 50 samples were in unfit for drinking category dwqi above 300 fig 6 table 3 the work revealed that groundwater of the chachro sub district was of very poor water to unfit for drinking 3 3 multivariate statistical analysis 3 3 1 principal components analysis pca pca is a statistical approach used to decrease the size of multi index information howladar et al 2021 khuhawar et al 2019 the analytical data obtained for 26 samples collected randomly were used for pca table 5 it is a statistical technique applied to decrease the magnitude of the multi index data set eleven parameters were used and three components were recognised with eigenvalues 1 the cumulative of the three principal components was 79 01 pc 1 has a 51 19 percentage of variance tds ec na ca k mg cl and so4 strongly correlate fig 7 positive loading of na reveals the silicate mineral weathering and ion exchange processes in groundwater of dug well aquifer pc 2 corresponded for variance 12 76 and hco3 indicated strong correlation 0 843 fig 7 principal component 3 shows 7 821 of the variance and indicates that so4 and no3 have a weak to moderate positive correlation 0 257 0 420 pc4 indicates a variance of 7 246 and reveals that k have a strong positive association 0 780 3 3 2 correlation matrix and data analysis tds and ec show a strong correlation among main cations calcium magnesium sodium and anions chlorides sulfate 0 833 0 916 0 994 and 0 922 0 794 respectively as shown in table 4 hco3 shows a very weak correlation with tds ec anions and cations mg and ca show strong correlation with each other and with na cl so4 2 0 866 0 878 and 0 787 0 914 and 0 838 0 767 and 0 760 respectively na shows strong correlation with ec tds mg2 ca2 cl so4 2 and weak correlation with k and hco3 0 994 0 994 0 878 0 787 0 985 0 770 and 0 325 0 078 respectively k shows a strong correlation with so4 2 0 695 hco3 and no3 show a very weak correlation with all parameters so4 2 show strong correlation with ec tds mg2 ca2 na k cl and very weak correlation with ph and hco3 0 794 0 794 0 767 0 760 0 770 0 695 0 760 and 0 390 0 009 respectively tds and ec association was strong to moderate in dug well water samples these factors add salinity to groundwater bashir et al 2017 nesrine et al 2015 moderate to the poor association between calcium and sulfate specifies that dissolution of gypsum was not evident instead the elevated level of ca2 may be the ion exchange or carbonate weathering bashir et al 2017 x zhang et al 2014 positive association of sodium with cl 0 985 so4 0 775 and mg 0 878 indicate that na is supplied from a silicate weathering source other than halite dissolution table 4 3 3 3 cluster analysis clustering is a statistical approach that facilitates the grouping of similar locations in various clusters based on distance criteria that characterise the parameters to be classified khuhawar et al 2019 the clustering method was used on 26 dug well samples to examine a cluster of a like sample locations distribution of current study area results of clustering of sample location indicate that three clusters are formed fig 8 and each cluster is further classified into sub clusters cluster 1a is consists of 09 samples 1 15 23 5 22 3 6 10 and 18 cluster 1 b comprises 03 samples 4 25 and 20 group 2a is based on 8 samples 2 11 19 7 8 13 9 and 21 and 2 b on 03 samples 12 14 16 cluster 3a comprises 02 samples 17 26 and 3 b on 01 samples 3 4 rock water interaction 3 4 1 silicate weathering among hydrogeochemical reactions the ion exchange direct and reverse chemical processes govern groundwater quality mostly hydro geochemistry assessment is preferred by plotting to scatter plots and ionic ratios mgbenu and egbueri 2019 the forward ion exchange reaction suggests the releasing of na by removing cations like ca 2 and mg 2 while reverse ion exchange indicates replacement of ca 2 and mg 2 to na usually from clay mineral surface within aquifers howladar et al 2021 toolabi et al 2021 bivariate diagram between na against cl fig 9 a suggests the existence of ion exchange chemical reaction within groundwater egbueri 2019 generally the sodium to chlorine proportion is roughly equivalent to 1 when evaporite dissolution would be an individual source of na fig 9b endorsed the input of silicate weathering and ion exchange e g albite dissolution equation 2 might be accountable for the rise of na in groundwater chen et al 2019 mgbenu and egbueri 2019 talib et al 2019 results show that 50 sample has na cl ratio 1 and the remaining 50 samples have a ratio 1 indicating the presence of ion exchange process barzegar et al 2019 mgbenu and egbueri 2019 however concentration na ion more than ca 2 and mg 2 confirms that the forward ion exchange silicate weathering process remains a crucial source of na ion in groundwater the forward ion exchange process increases na ion concentration while reverse ion exchange increases ca 2 ion by reducing na ion in groundwater among the major cations sodium is dominant obtained from weathering of silicate and halite dissolution talib et al 2019 bivariate diagrams between ca 2 mg 2 and na against hco3 ions concentration meq l were plotted fig 9c and d fig 9c revealed that most samples fall below the equiline in the forward ion exchange field fig 9d indicated that most samples clustered below equiline suggesting essential ionic concentration supply from the carbonate weathering process egbueri 2019 furthermore the result verifies that the concentration of hco3 more than so4 2 and it confirms the dominance of silicate weathering egbueri 2019 thakur et al 2021 fig 10 a and b demonstrates the bivariate plot of ca 2 against hco3 and so4 2 and reveals that samples clustered below and above equiline suggesting that the silicate and carbonate weathering process plays a significant role in controlling the groundwater chemistry if silicate weathering is a major supplier of na then the most abundant anion should be hco3 and excess concentration of hco3 among anions validates this statement equation 02 however the exceeding na in the groundwater cation exchange process may also be liable

dissolution the co3 and so4 2 dissolution input is demonstrated by the bivariate plot between ca 2 mg 2 versus so4 2 hco3 fig 10d carbonate dissolution indicated if samples laying on 1 1 of ca 2 mg 2 and so4 2 hco3 then sulfate the main contributor of ca 2 mg 2 and so4 2 in groundwater expression 4 5 whereas if water samples fall above the equiline line demonstrate then the dissolution of carbonates has less input of ca 2 and mg 2 3 4 2 ion exchange chloro alkaline indices cai 1 and cai 11 suggested by schoeller 1965 gives detailed knowledge about the ion exchange between groundwater and aquifers that have major impacts on water chemistry and its assessment chen et al 2019 liu et al 2020 talib et al 2019 chloro alkaline indices area is computed from the following mathematical equation cai 1 cl na k cl cai 11 cl na k hco 3 so 4 2 co 3 no 3 here values were in meq l cai negatively demonstrates the release of na and absorption ca 2 and mg 2 from country rock and is called the cation exchange process equation 8 and cai positive values indicate replacement of na with ca 2 and mg 2 within groundwater indicates reverse ion exchange process equation 9 chen et al 2019 liu et al

10c that more than 50 of samples have cai negative values revealing that forward ion exchange remained a significant process equation 7 however reverse ion exchange has taken a significant part in the major change in cation as shown in fig 10f in addition to this influence of silicate weathering and dissolution of carbonate is also demonstrated ca 2 na against mg 2 na diagram fig 11 a and ca 2 na against hco 3 na graph fig 11b the ca 2 na against mg 2 na diagram illustrates that silicate weathering and evaporate dissolution are key sources of mg 2 whereas most of the samples gathered in and

and b comprise of association of tds against weight ratio of na k na k ca 2 and cl cl hco3 when plotted in these diagrams the current study s data indicates that most sample locations clustered near the evaporation and rock dominance field revealed that the evaporation process is the primary source the rock dominance process acts as a contributing source that interacts with groundwater shallow depth aquifers in fluvial plains may result in severe evaporation 3 4 4 water classification a graphical tri linear diagram fig 13 a isolates freshwater phase distinction source of hydrogeochemical parameters by producing scatter graphs of major cations and anions concentration the piper graph comprises one diamond shape graph and two ternary diagrams the diamond shape graph indicates that almost all samples indicate the nacl type water cl is dominant for the anion triangle than so4 2 and hco3 co3 anions cation ternary graph reveals that na ion was prevalent and anion graph indicates the dominance of cl ion in the groundwater of the research area results of the research area suggested that mostly nacl type water was leading with na and cl type species fig 13a the chadha diagram was applied to expose the geochemistry of the study area better fig 13b the groundwater samples were divided into eight different groups in the chadha diagram the present results showed all samples dots were found in zone 7 so4 2 cl na type and no samples were found in any other zone however results showed the so4 2 cl na containing minerals present in the study area such as dissolution of silicates halite and gypsum which controlled the research area s geochemistry lanjwani et al 2021 3 5 assessment of water quality for irrigation 3 5 1 sodium adsorption ratio sar sodium or alkali hazard in irrigation is the high concentration bashir et al 2017 ogunfowokan et al 2013 sar ranges from 2 91 to 18 51 meq l table 6 if the values of sar 9 were considered as inappropriate for agriculture use awais et al 2016 results reveal that 50 of sample locations were good to doubtful and 50 of samples were unsuitable for agriculture use an elevated level of na in the chachro sub district might be associated with ion exchange processes operating on the surface of clay minerals and weathering of sediments comprised of na bearing minerals in the aquifer vasanthavigar et al 2010 3 5 2 residual sodium carbonate rsc rsc is determined as a hazard of carbonate bicarbonate in water quality used for agriculture the result of the rsc for the chachro sub district varies from 31 49 to 10 32 the results of rsc indicates that 92 31 of samples were suitable and 7 69 of sample locations were unsuitable for agriculture purposes table 6 rsc ve amount reveals the elevated level of na ion through replacing ca 2 mg 2 through precipitate ca 2 as carbon dioxide leaving na as leading cation moreover rsc ve indicates the enhanced ca 2 mg 2 concentration due to bicarbonate dissociation to form cahco3 mghco3 chitsazan et al 2019 the analysis data reveals that most water samples are appropriate for agriculture high rsc reduces the permeability and moment of air in soil bashir et al 2017 3 5 3 sodium percentage na results of na ranged from 59 35 to 90 27 and results of na indicates that almost all sample stations were unfit for agriculture use results of sodium percentage groundwater of the chachro sub district was classified as suggested islam et al 2017 srinivas et al 2013 results suggested that 19 23 of samples were doubtful and 80 77 were unsuitable for agriculture elevated concentration of sodium percentage in sediments alters soil structure aeration and infiltration singaraja et al 2014 due to the excess level of sodium decline the capability of crops to absorb water and nutrients from the soil khanoranga and khalid 2019 3 5 4 kelly s ratio kr kr is utilised to classify groundwater used for agriculture and na is calculated against ca 2 mg 2 the kr values 1 are unsuitable and 1 are considered appropriate for agriculture use the result indicates that all the sample locations were unfit for agriculture use 3 5 5 permeability index pi long term use of groundwater for agriculture with na ca 2 mg 2 hco3 excess level decreases the permeability of the soil above 75 and 50 pi amount was considered excellent good groundwater quality for agriculture use 50 pi values were deemed unsuitable for groundwater quality for agriculture use the study area results for twenty six sample locations reveal that groundwater quality was excellent for agriculture use table 6 3 5 6 magnesium hazard mh it is significant parameter irrigation indices for assessing the suitability of groundwater proposed by szabolcs 1964 talib et al 2019 the result of the study area reveals that 96 15 of samples were unsuitable for irrigation use table 6 mh value 50 suitable and the value 50 was unsuitable for irrigation the higher value of mh damages soil structure bashir et al 2017 3 5 7 wilcox diagram ec against sar wilcox diagram wilcox 1948 was used to assess groundwater prospects for agriculture the wilcox graph is consists of two variables ec against sar in which s corresponds to sar concentration c stands for the salinity in terms of electrical conductivity fig 14 a is categorized into four groups c1 to c4 and s1 to s4 most samples fall in s2 to s4 medium to very high salinity and c4 very high conductivity region the graph indicated that most samples clustered in the high salinity lower sar class which is inappropriate for agriculture use 3 5 8 salinity hazards electrical conductivity is used to determine the salinity hazard for the crops the elevated salinity level decreases the plants osmotic process affects the absorption of groundwater and soil nutrients lanjwani et al 2020 samtio et al 2021 the salinity hazards are categorized into four groups low salinity ec 500 μs cm no sample was found in this class medium salinity ec 500 1000 μs cm no samples were found in this category which can be used for irrigation high salinity ec 1000 3000 μs cm and very high salinity ec 3000 μs cm most of the samples were found in this category fig 14b 4 conclusion the recent developments in the tharparkar district like open cast mining coal based power generation plant discharge of mining waste in small depression b w the dunes dug well aquifer is only source of potable water in the study area now it is contaminated through reoccuring monsoon cycle the dug well aquifer should be monitored sfor the conservation of groundwater rosource of the study area the results reveal that all the sample locations of the study area for ec tds na and cl ions have higher concentrations than the recommended limits of who 2011 the pca correlation coefficient hca gibbs and scatter graphs reveal that silicate weathering evaporite gypsum calcite and halite dissolution were the significant processes that alter the water geochemistry in addition to this the chloro alkaline indices indicates that the existence of forward ion exchange process in the study area piper diagram suggests that almost all dug well water samples are na cl type and chadha
