7425,the traditional alternating direction implicit adi scheme has been proven to be incapable of modelling trans critical flows its inherent lack of shock capturing capability often results in spurious oscillations and computational instabilities however the adi scheme is still widely adopted in flood modelling software and various special treatments have been designed to stabilise the computation modification of the boussinesq coefficient to adjust the amount of fluid inertia is a numerical treatment that allows the adi scheme to be applicable to rapid flows this study comprehensively examines the impact of this numerical treatment over a range of flow conditions a shock capturing tvd maccormack model is used to provide reference results for unsteady flows over a frictionless bed such as idealised dam break floods the results suggest that an increase in the value of the boussinesq coefficient reduces the amplitude of the spurious oscillations the opposite is observed for steady rapid flows over a frictional bed finally a two dimensional urban flooding phenomenon is presented involving unsteady flow over a frictional bed the results show that increasing the value of the boussinesq coefficient can significantly reduce the numerical oscillations and reduce the predicted area of inundation in order to stabilise the adi computations the boussinesq coefficient could be judiciously raised or lowered depending on whether the rapid flow is steady or unsteady and whether the bed is frictional or frictionless an increase in the boussinesq coefficient generally leads to overprediction of the propagating speed of the flood wave over a frictionless bed but the opposite is true when bed friction is significant keywords boussinesq coefficient alternating direction implicit adi shallow water equations flooding supercritical flows 1 introduction the increasing risk of flooding especially flash flooding has become a prevalent and pressing issue worldwide flash floods involve high flow velocities which can be very destructive and pose a serious risk to both infrastructure and human life therefore it is extremely important that such flooding events can be predicted accurately the horizontal scale of a flood is normally much larger than its depth this type of free surface flow problem can be mathematically described by the shallow water equations swes these equations can be derived from the depth integration of the three dimensional incompressible navier stokes equations under the assumptions of hydrostatic pressure distribution and negligible vertical velocity with the appropriate initial conditions and boundary conditions these nonlinear equations can be solved numerically researchers have developed various numerical models to solve the swes over the past few decades the alternating direction implicit adi scheme is one such method which is still widely used this scheme was first proposed by peaceman and rachford 1955 after which leendertse combined the adi scheme and a staggered grid and developed a computational model for two dimensional flows the stability domain of this scheme is relatively large and the balance between computational cost and accuracy is attractive leendertse and gritton 1971 however liang et al 2006a demonstrated that the adi scheme is unable to predict trans critical and supercritical flows two established approaches are suitable for resolving shocks such as hydraulic jumps and bores in the solution i e shock fitting and shock capturing methods shock capturing methods are preferable since they utilize a universal strategy over the whole domain without treating the shocks separately as for most explicit schemes time steps for shock capturing schemes are restricted by the cfl condition currently the adi scheme is still widely used in a lot of commercial and research software such as flood modeller www floodmodeller com and hec ras www hec usace army mil two widely adopted numerical treatments are available for stabilising the adi scheme in simulating rapid flows one is to introduce artificial diffusion and the other is to modify the boussinesq coefficient physically the boussinesq coefficient quantifies the momentum effect of the non uniform velocity distribution over the depth because it appears in the advective acceleration term in the swes it can also be treated as a pure numerical parameter to tune the amount of fluid inertia to be considered in the simulation hence its link to the vertical distribution of the velocity can be ignored instead the boussinesq coefficient is allowed to be freely tuned to eliminate the fictitious fluctuations and increase computational stability just like the artificial viscosity coefficient these treatments can partly mitigate the inherent instability of the adi model when solving for trans critical flows however their results may seriously deviate from the correct solutions to the original swes where the boussinesq coefficient takes the physically based values of around 1 0 although the effect of artificial viscosity on the computational results has been extensively studied the influence of the boussinesq coefficient is not well understood this paper aims to demonstrate the impact of changing the boussinesq coefficient when simulating rapid flows in various situations the test cases first consider the instantaneous one dimensional 1 d and the two dimensional 2 d dam break floods over frictionless flat beds with the solutions predicted by a tvd maccormack model and experimental data used as references then steady flow over frictional and irregular beds is simulated finally the paper describes the applications of the 2 d adi model to unsteady flood flows over an actual urban area in glasgow scotland in all the cases studied the flow is either supercritical or nearly supercritical and thus contains steep water level and velocity variations this is because when the flow is subcritical the adi model is capable of predicting the phenomena accurately with the correct value of β which is close to unity considering that there is no need to take non physical values of β when the flow is slow and smooth this study focuses on situations with shocks present in the solutions 2 shallow water equations the three dimensional reynolds averaged continuity and navier stokes equations are often integrated over the water column for analysing the flows confined in a thin layer utilising the assumption of the hydrostatic pressure distribution and the kinematic boundary condition of the free surface the resulting equations are simplified into the swes when neglecting the coriolis viscous and wind forces the standard swes are expressed as 1 η t q x x q y y 0 2 q x t β q x 2 h x β q x q y h y gh η x gq x q x 2 q y 2 h 2 c 2 υ 2 2 q x x 2 2 q x y 2 2 q y x y 3 q y t β q y 2 h y β q x q y h x gh η y gq y q x 2 q y 2 h 2 c 2 υ 2 q y x 2 2 2 q y y 2 2 q x x y where t is time η represents the water surface elevation above the still water datum qx and q y constitute the volumetric discharge components per unit width in the x and y directions respectively h h η is the total water column depth in which h is the depth below the still water datum g is the gravitational acceleration c represents the chézy roughness coefficient which is determined from the manning formula in this study β is called the boussinesq coefficient a momentum correction factor for the non uniform vertical velocity profile υ is the viscosity coefficient for the dam break flows flash floods and other rapid flow phenomena considered in this paper the fluid inertia pressure force and bed friction are often the dominant factors influencing the flow whereas the influence of viscosity is generally insignificant assuming the flow is along the x direction then the boussinesq coefficient can be defined as 4 β z b η u 2 dz u 2 h where the flow velocity u is a function of the vertical coordinate z and u is the depth averaged velocity this momentum correction factor depends on the velocity distribution over the depth and should be always greater than unity it increases with the increasing non uniformity of the velocity distribution over the depth for a logarithmic velocity profile the momentum correction factor can be expressed as goldstein 1938 5 β 1 g c 2 κ 2 where κ is von kármán s constant from the above equation it can be seen that the value of β increases with the decrease of the chézy coefficient which signifies an increase in the bed roughness vertical shearing and velocity non uniformity alternatively an assumed seventh power law velocity profile leads to a constant value for β of 1 016 in many practical modelling studies the momentum correction factor is simply set to unity assuming a uniform velocity distribution on the other hand because β appears in the advective acceleration term in eqs 2 and 3 it can also be used to adjust the amount of fluid inertia to be considered in the computer simulations for example the advective acceleration can be completed ignored by taking β to be zero some researchers adjust the boussinesq coefficient to improve the stability of the adi based models following an idea similar to the adjustment of the viscosity coefficient in the numerical simulations in such cases the value of β should be treated as purely artificial just as the artificial viscosity coefficient physically the value of β should never be smaller than unity according to the eq 5 however in the numerical modelling the advective acceleration can be completed ignored by setting the value of β to be zero eqs 1 3 are not in a conservative formulation of the swes as a set of hyperbolic equations the swes admit discontinuities in their solutions in order to maintain the correct motion of the shocks in numerical prediction the conservative form of the swes should be deployed to ensure the exact mass and momentum conservation in the numerical discretization toro 2001 liang et al 2006a 3 numerical methods 3 1 adi scheme the adi scheme is widely used in practice to solve the swes in the adi scheme each time step is divided into two half time steps in the first half time step the x direction terms and derivatives are discretised using an implicit scheme while an explicit scheme is used to approximate the values associated with the y direction quantities and derivatives conversely the second half time step is solved using an implicit scheme in the y direction approximation while an explicit scheme is used in the x direction approximation by adopting the implicit schemes alternately the growth of the computation error is restricted to increase the stability of the computation at the same time the computation is highly efficient with the deployment of the tri diagonal matrix algorithm tdma the detailed numerical schemes for the adi model used in this paper can be found in leendertse and gritton 1971 falconer 1986 and liang et al 2006b however this scheme has been proved to be incapable of predicting flows with steep water levels and large velocity gradients meselhe and holly 1997 liang et al 2006a the lack of shock capturing capability makes this scheme unable to predict accurately the rapidly varying flows containing sudden hydraulic jumps drops and bores 3 2 shock capturing scheme there are numerous shock capturing numerical schemes in this study a tvd maccormack scheme is chosen to provide reference solutions in this scheme the 2 d equations are solved as two orthogonal 1 d problems in each time step based on the operator splitting technique this process is outlined in detail in liang et al 2006a and is thus not repeated in this paper the whole scheme has second order accuracy in both time and space but it introduces the right amount of diffusion to remove numerical oscillations near the steep variations this provides the scheme with the total variation diminishing property since its development extensive verifications and applications have been made to demonstrate its accuracy and efficiency together with many refinements e g liang et al 2007 2016 wang et al 2016 4 unsteady flow over frictionless bed 4 1 one dimensional case a side view of the computational setup is demonstrated in fig 1 where h 1 and h 0 represent the water depths of the upstream headwater and downstream tail water respectively a dam is located at x 500 m with the initial upstream water depth of 10 m and the downstream water depth of 2 m the time step is 0 1 s and the grid spacing is 10 m this situation is considered as a 1 d problem because the dam is assumed to collapse completely conversely if the dam is only partially ruined the problem becomes 2 d as will be discussed in section 4 2 fig 2 shows the water surface profile 18 s after the dam failure produced by the adi model and the tvd maccormack model with four typical β values for β 1 0 theoretical solutions are well known and are thus included in fig 2 b in general the significant difference between the solutions obtained with the two numerical schemes is the presence or absence of spurious oscillations in the discontinuous region it is worth noting that when the value of β is relatively large as shown in fig 2 d the oscillation reduces significantly this can be attributed to a decrease in the height of the flood front which induces a drop in the amplitude of the oscillation it should be noted that artificially modifying the value of β introduces systematic errors to the simulations the theoretical solution corresponds to the β value of 1 0 which is taken to be the correct solution to this problem although increasing β reduces the numerical oscillations in the adi modelling the adi results still deviate from the theoretical solution by predicting the wrong water depth and propagation speed of the flood front the l2 norm between the theoretical and adi predicted values is defined as 6 l 2 i 1 n v i v ai 2 where n is the total number of grid points vai and vi and are the theoretical and adi predicted values respectively these quantities may be either the water depth or the velocity as seen in fig 3 the minimum l2 norm is still observed at β 1 0 in spite of the numerical fluctuations as shown in fig 2 b in terms of the propagating speed of the flood the solutions using the adi scheme are consistent with the solutions using the tvd scheme as seen in fig 2 in addition the height of flood fronts predicted by the two schemes is shown to decrease as β increases fig 4 a and b demonstrate the trend of the variation with β using the tvd results alone the gradation of color indicates the changing value of β it can be seen t hat a lower flood front height and faster flood front propagation are associated with a larger β the faster propagation of the flood front with a larger β can be explained by the eigenvalues of the swes when neglecting the bed friction and fluid viscosity it can be easily calculated that the eigenvalues of the 1 d swes along the x direction are 7 λ 1 β u β 2 β u 2 gh 8 λ 2 β u β 2 β u 2 gh hence the speed of the downstream travelling characteristic λ 2 increases with the increase of β special values of λ 2 are gh at β 0 and u gh at β 1 a smaller β value generally leads to a smaller velocity in this frictionless unsteady flows the flow velocity determines the water depth through the conservation of mass as seen in fig 4 b a smaller β value then results in a higher water depth at the flood front and a smaller water depth in the reservoir 4 2 two dimensional case we now consider an instantaneous 2 d dam break flood over a frictionless and flat bed as shown in fig 5 a dam located at x 1 m divides the whole domain 3 m 2 m into two parts initially still water of depth 0 64 m is present upstream of the dam on the left and a dry floodplain downstream of the dam on the right at the boundaries of the floodplain a zero gradient condition is specified so that water can escape from the domain freely in the present simulations the spatial step is 0 04 m and the time step is 0 0001 s the experiment for this symmetrical dam break flood over a flat floodplain was performed by fraccarollo and toro 1995 and their experimental data are referred to in this section for comparison purposes fig 5 shows four snapshots of the overall water surface variations with different values of β 5 s after the dam failure generally it can be seen that the stability of predicted results increases with the β value in the downstream region the bore waves are formed with small β values but they disappear as β increases as shown in fig 5 a and b the bore waves are allowed to move out of the domain which verifies the validity of the transmissive boundary condition implemented in the simulation in the upstream reservoir the water depth decreases with the decrease of the β value indicating higher flow rates from the reservoir to the floodplain fig 6 compares the predicted and measured water depth histories at four locations together with an ensemble of the results with different β values the darker grey lines represent results with larger values of β two features are obvious in these plots one is that a higher β value prevents oscillations as previously noted numerical oscillations are most pronounced in the result for the point located at the downstream region when the value of β is relatively small as shown in fig 6 d while the largest β value produces the smoothest curve the second feature is that the predicted water depth in the reservoir increases with the growth of β differences in the simulated water depth are biggest at point x 1 m y 1 m up to 0 18 m while this difference is smallest at point x 1 8 m y 1 44 m with only a 0 02 m difference over the range of β from 0 0 to 2 0 5 steady flow over frictional bed 5 1 one dimensional case the scenario considered here is trans critical flow over an irregular channel bed fig 7 shows the topography of the channel bottom with the exact bed coordinates given by tseng 2004 in this case the bed profile remains unchanged in the direction normal to the page to enable a 1 d analysis the total length of the channel is 1600 m with a grid size of 8 m the manning roughness coefficient considered here is 0 033 s m1 3 a constant unit width discharge of either 1 18 m2 s or 0 59 m2 s is imposed at the upstream boundary and the water depth is fixed at the end of downstream at 0 42 m the conditions of the flow are similar to what might arise in a mountainous river where the terrain is complex and steep the flow over such a bed profile varies rapidly with several transitions between sub critical and super critical regimes so that the case is a challenging test for numerical schemes fig 7 compares the predicted water surface elevations and respective froude numbers between the two numerical models in fig 7 a the froude number is mostly less than unity and the flow is rarely supercritical when β is set to be 1 0 the two models predict almost identical results however differences are quite noticeable for the case in which β is set to be 2 0 as shown in fig 7 b the notable discrepancies are found at a few supercritical locations for example at streamwise distances of 480 m 1080 m and 1350 m and other locations when the froude number exceeds 1 0 the two models give different results some oscillations appear in the adi model s results at these positions indicating its lack of shock capturing capability while results of the tvd model do not demonstrate these oscillations hence the increase in β value promotes the generation of spurious oscillations in adi modelling which is opposite to the finding previously obtained for the frictionless case study figs 8 and 9 show a range of water elevations predicted by the two models for a series of β values comparison between the two figures reveals how different unit width discharges lead to the different behavior of each model in general the water elevations predicted by the adi model are sensitive to the varying β value in terms of the oscillation generation apart from the change in the average water levels with the increase of β noticeable spikes in predicted water elevations occur at the steep falls of the river bed oscillations are most pronounced in the results when β is 2 0 in the current study this implies that the reduction of β value can improve the computational stability effectively and inhibit the unwanted oscillations in the adi model another general pattern is that a smaller β value results in a lower water depth in the simulation and a larger flow rate leads to bigger water depth variation for example a larger β value results in more significant spurious oscillations at x 480 m and close to the upstream boundary which can be seen in fig 9 a when the unit width discharge is 0 59 m2 s the water depth increases by 0 16 m with β increasing from 0 to 2 however at the unit width discharge of 1 18 m2 s the water depth increases by 0 29 m unlike the unsteady flow over a frictionless bed studied in the previous section where the fluid inertia is balanced by the water surface gradient the main influencing factors are bed friction and the water surface gradient in steady flow over a frictional bed because a larger β value generally leads to a larger velocity which then leads to a larger bed friction the water surface gradient should be increased to overcome the bed friction which attributes to the increased water level as β increases in figs 8 and 9 5 2 two dimensional case boscastle is a small fishing port in cornwall uk situated on the intersection of the river valency and river jordan which continues into the celtic sea as shown in fig 10 a the port s location and regional climate have left boscastle inherently vulnerable to flooding among notable floods that occurred in the past few decades the 2004 flood was the most severe flood ever recorded by the village roseveare and trapmore 2008 hr wallingford has undertaken extensive data collection from photos observations and residual evidence of the flood that occurred in 2004 due to the wealth of evidence availability this event has been an excellent study case for assessing flood simulation software wallingford 2005 with the help of the environment agency a digital elevation model dem was extracted for the boscastle area the background digital terrain model was obtained by filtering out the buildings and vegetation of the lidar elevation data then buildings and bridges were added using gis software according to the ordinance survey maps during the 2004 floods the bridge openings were blocked by debris and cars thus it would be reasonable to include only the top of the bridge deck in the dem the underwater bathymetry was merged with the dem according to the cross sectional drawings provided by halcrow group ltd the detailed procedure of generating the dem suitable for flood modelling is given by tuckley 2010 the domain was discretised into 860 by 470 grid cells the hydrological analysis gave the peak discharges at the upstream ends of the river valency and the river jordan to be 160 m3 s and 19 m3 s respectively the water level at the celtic sea boundary was specified to be 3 5 m a constant manning coefficient of 0 03 s m1 3 was set altogether the domain because the 2004 flood flow is rapid and contains steep variations the adi model cannot produce stable results without using a reduced value of β successful simulations were achieved with β values of 0 0 0 4 and 0 6 at higher β values the simulation terminated in the middle of the computation the flow through the river is illustrated by plotting the water level and bed level variations along the river centerline as shown in fig 11 a it is clear that a larger β value results in a higher predicted water surface elevation such a trend coincides well with the 1 d case study in this section confirming that when modelling steady and frictional flow phenomena a reduction in the value of β can effectively suppress the generation of unwanted oscillations in the numerical results of the adi model however this is at the cost of reducing the accuracy of the numerical model as the water elevation will be underpredicted as illustrated in fig 11 b the adi results with a larger β value generally agree better with the surveyed data 6 unsteady flow over frictional bed the findings in section 5 are seemingly opposite to those in the section 4 because of different flow conditions this implies that the boussinesq coefficient should be adjusted either up or down in order to eliminate computational oscillations in the adi models depending on the flow situations except for the high frequency oscillations the adi and tvd models predict similar overall trends in water depth and velocity variations which provides reassurance as to the correctness of the present simulations the final case considered here is based on an actual flood that occurred in the city of glasgow scotland uk on 30 july 2002 in this case the flow is unsteady and the bed is uneven and frictional the two dimensional adi model is applied to simulate the flood event over a 1 0 km 0 4 km urban catchment a 1 m resolution lidar survey was undertaken by infoterra ltd the surveyed data were processed to leave only the bare earth information and then modified according to the ordnance survey mastermap that defines the building locations road network and land use types a single set of friction coefficients was used with the manning coefficient of roads and vegetation being 0 015 s m1 3 and 0 05 s m1 3 respectively flooding at this site was caused by a burst pipe near the north east corner which can be seen in fig 12 as qin the detailed information and data on the area as well as the treatment of the boundary conditions for this case can be found in hunter et al 2008 in order to demonstrate the changes of water level clearly four reference points are selected representing the vicinity of the pipe burst the main road the minor road and the low lying region respectively the exact locations of the reference points denoted g1 g2 g3 and g4 are marked in fig 12 which is a contour map of the ground elevations fig 13 presents the time series of water elevations predicted by the adi model at the four gauging points to validate the present simulations the results obtained by the shock capturing numerical scheme in hunter et al 2008 are also plotted in fig 13 as references three conclusions can be drawn from observing this dataset first spurious oscillations are obvious when β is close to zero especially at points g2 and g4 where shallow high velocity and convergent flow happens in contrast the curves with larger β are relatively smooth indicating that a large β value may help mitigate the inherent instability of the adi model in this case study this finding corresponds well with that observed in the case studies of unsteady flow over frictionless beds secondly a general pattern can be summarised in terms of the arrival time of flood waves the smaller β value always predicts an earlier arrival of the flood wave especially for the points g1 and g3 where water accumulates giving rise to large water depths in the course of the simulation although these differences in the arrival time are only of the order of 3 or 4 min they can be deemed significant given the short duration of the flooding event thirdly the peak flood depth is not sensitive to the value of β differences in the maximum predicted water elevation are only obvious for point g2 up to only 8 cm when the value of β ranges from 0 0 to 2 0 hence the variation in β for this test case does not significantly alter the water depth the inundation extent is another important parameter when assessing the flood fig 14 depicts the inundated areas of the unban catchment in the backdrop of the three dimensional topography 24 min after the initiation of the flood at this moment the flood has spread through the main roads and streets reaching the lower part of the region located at about x 180 m water travels mainly along roads and streets since they have a relatively small roughness value and a low ground level compared with the neighbouring land features some rather fragmented arrangements of the wet and dry patches are notable in fig 14 a with a smaller value of β it may therefore be said that even small numerical oscillations may have a large effect on shallow flow depths thus resulting in a fragmented pattern of inundation as β increases these anomalies disappear and the inundation extent gradually decreases as shown in fig 14 b such phenomena are correspondingly quantified in fig 15 where the impact of modifying β on the inundated area is shown in detail at 4 instants it implies that the flood front propagation slows down and the flooded area gradually reduces as the value of β increases over a frictionless bed the inundated area is overpredicted for increased values of β as seen in fig 4 the reverse occurs when the bed friction is significant as seen in figs 14 and 15 for unsteady flow over a frictional bed the fluid inertia water surface gradient and bed friction are all potentially important factors as an increase in β is accompanied by increased velocity and bed friction a larger water surface gradient will then be required to overcome the bed friction with a fixed water level difference to drive the flow a larger β value may counterintuitively lead to slower propagation of the flood front over a frictional bed 7 conclusions in this paper the consequences of modifying the β value in modelling rapid flows have been assessed in a wide range of flow conditions firstly comparison is made between the adi and tvd maccormack models concerning 1 d and 2 d dam break floods over frictionless and flat beds in these cases the results suggest that the amplitude of the spurious oscillations decreases with the increase of the boussinesq coefficient hence use of a large β value helps the adi model to overcome its inherent instability when simulating rapidly varying dam break flows it is also found that increasing the value of β increases the propagation speed of flood waves when modelling unsteady flows over a frictionless bed however opposite results are observed for steady flows with a frictional bed the results in these situations suggest that the amplitude of the spurious oscillations decreases with the decrease of the boussinesq coefficient meanwhile the steady water surface elevation is predicted to be lower with a smaller β value finally the simulation of a flash flood over a complex urban terrain has been studied and the impact of the β coefficient on the solution of the adi model is further examined for unsteady flow over a frictional bed the results indicate that increase in the boussinesq coefficient can significantly reduce the amplitude of the numerical oscillations in the adi simulations the inundated area gradually reduces as the coefficient increases these results show the complicated relationship between the β value and the computational results which depends on whether the flow is steady or unsteady and whether the bed is frictionless or frictional the findings

flash floods and other rapid flow phenomena considered in this paper the fluid inertia pressure force and bed friction are often the dominant factors influencing the flow whereas the influence of viscosity is generally insignificant assuming the flow is along the x direction then the boussinesq coefficient can be defined as 4 β z b η u 2 dz u 2 h where the flow velocity u is a function of the vertical coordinate z and u is the depth averaged velocity this momentum correction factor depends on the velocity distribution over the depth and should be always greater than unity it increases with the increasing non uniformity of the velocity distribution over the depth for a logarithmic velocity profile the momentum correction factor can be expressed as goldstein 1938 5 β 1 g c 2 κ 2 where κ is von kármán s constant from the above equation it can be seen that the value of β increases with the decrease of the chézy coefficient which signifies an increase in the bed roughness vertical shearing and velocity non uniformity alternatively an assumed seventh power law velocity profile leads to a constant value for β of 1 016 in many practical modelling studies the momentum correction factor is simply set to unity assuming a uniform velocity distribution on the other hand because β appears in the advective acceleration term in eqs 2 and 3 it can also be used to adjust the amount of fluid inertia to be considered in the computer simulations for example the advective acceleration can be completed ignored by taking β to be zero some researchers adjust the boussinesq coefficient to improve the stability of the adi based models following an idea similar to the adjustment of the viscosity coefficient in the numerical simulations in such cases the value of β should be treated as purely artificial just as the artificial viscosity coefficient physically the value of β should never be smaller than unity according to the eq 5 however in the numerical modelling the advective acceleration can be completed ignored by setting the value of β to be zero eqs 1 3 are not in a conservative formulation of the swes as a set of hyperbolic equations the swes admit discontinuities in their solutions in order to maintain the correct motion of the shocks in numerical prediction the conservative form of the swes should be deployed to ensure the exact mass and momentum conservation in the numerical discretization toro 2001 liang et al 2006a 3 numerical methods 3 1 adi scheme the adi scheme is widely used in practice to solve the swes in the adi scheme each time step is divided into two half time steps in the first half time step the x direction terms and derivatives are discretised using an implicit scheme while an explicit scheme is used to approximate the values associated with the y direction quantities and derivatives conversely the second half time step is solved using an implicit scheme in the y direction approximation while an explicit scheme is used in the x direction approximation by adopting the implicit schemes alternately the growth of the computation error is restricted to increase the stability of the computation at the same time the computation is highly efficient with the deployment of the tri diagonal matrix algorithm tdma the detailed numerical schemes for the adi model used in this paper can be found in leendertse and gritton 1971 falconer 1986 and liang et al 2006b however this scheme has been proved to be incapable of predicting flows with steep water levels and large velocity gradients meselhe and holly 1997 liang et al 2006a the lack of shock capturing capability makes this scheme unable to predict accurately the rapidly varying flows containing sudden hydraulic jumps drops and bores 3 2 shock capturing scheme there are numerous shock capturing numerical schemes in this study a tvd maccormack scheme is chosen to provide reference solutions in this scheme the 2 d equations are solved as two orthogonal 1 d problems in each time step based on the operator splitting technique this process is outlined in detail in liang et al 2006a and is thus not repeated in this paper the whole scheme has second order accuracy in both time and space but it introduces the right amount of diffusion to remove numerical oscillations near the steep variations this provides the scheme with the total variation diminishing property since its development extensive verifications and applications have been made to demonstrate its accuracy and efficiency together with many refinements e g liang et al 2007 2016 wang et al 2016 4 unsteady flow over frictionless bed 4 1 one dimensional case a side view of the computational setup is demonstrated in fig 1 where h 1 and h 0 represent the water depths of the upstream headwater and downstream tail water respectively a dam is located at x 500 m with the initial upstream water depth of 10 m and the downstream water depth of 2 m the time step is 0 1 s and the grid spacing is 10 m this situation is considered as a 1 d problem because the dam is assumed to collapse completely conversely if the dam is only partially ruined the problem becomes 2 d as will be discussed in section 4 2 fig 2 shows the water surface profile 18 s after the dam failure produced by the adi model and the tvd maccormack model with four typical β values for β 1 0 theoretical solutions are well known and are thus included in fig 2 b in general the significant difference between the solutions obtained with the two numerical schemes is the presence or absence of spurious oscillations in the discontinuous region it is worth noting that when the value of β is relatively large as shown in fig 2 d the oscillation reduces significantly this can be attributed to a decrease in the height of the flood front which induces a drop in the amplitude of the oscillation it should be noted that artificially modifying the value of β introduces systematic errors to the simulations the theoretical solution corresponds to the β value of 1 0 which is taken to be the correct solution to this problem although increasing β reduces the numerical oscillations in the adi modelling the adi results still deviate from the theoretical solution by predicting the wrong water depth and propagation speed of the flood front the l2 norm between the theoretical and adi predicted values is defined as 6 l 2 i 1 n v i v ai 2 where n is the total number of grid points vai and vi and are the theoretical and adi predicted values respectively these quantities may be either the water depth or the velocity as seen in fig 3 the minimum l2 norm is still observed at β 1 0 in spite of the numerical fluctuations as shown in fig 2 b in terms of the propagating speed of the flood the solutions using the adi scheme are consistent with the solutions using the tvd scheme as seen in fig 2 in addition the height of flood fronts predicted by the two schemes is shown to decrease as β increases fig 4 a and b demonstrate the trend of the variation with β using the tvd results alone the gradation of color indicates the changing value of β it can be seen t hat a lower flood front height and faster flood front propagation are associated with a larger β the faster propagation of the flood front with a larger β can be explained by the eigenvalues of the swes when neglecting the bed friction and fluid viscosity it can be easily calculated that the eigenvalues of the 1 d swes along the x direction are 7 λ 1 β u β 2 β u 2 gh 8 λ 2 β u β 2 β u 2 gh hence the speed of the downstream travelling characteristic λ 2 increases with the increase of β special values of λ 2 are gh at β 0 and u gh at β 1 a smaller β value generally leads to a smaller velocity in this frictionless unsteady flows the flow velocity determines the water depth through the conservation of mass as seen in fig 4 b a smaller β value then results in a higher water depth at the flood front and a smaller water depth in the reservoir 4 2 two dimensional case we now consider an instantaneous 2 d dam break flood over a frictionless and flat bed as shown in fig 5 a dam located at x 1 m divides the whole domain 3 m 2 m into two parts initially still water of depth 0 64 m is present upstream of the dam on the left and a dry floodplain downstream of the dam on the right at the boundaries of the floodplain a zero gradient condition is specified so that water can escape from the domain freely in the present simulations the spatial step is 0 04 m and the time step is 0 0001 s the experiment for this symmetrical dam break flood over a flat floodplain was performed by fraccarollo and toro 1995 and their experimental data are referred to in this section for comparison purposes fig 5 shows four snapshots of the overall water surface variations with different values of β 5 s after the dam failure generally it can be seen that the stability of predicted results increases with the β value in the downstream region the bore waves are formed with small β values but they disappear as β increases as shown in fig 5 a and b the bore waves are allowed to move out of the domain which verifies the validity of the transmissive boundary condition implemented in the simulation in the upstream reservoir the water depth decreases with the decrease of the β value indicating higher flow rates from the reservoir to the floodplain fig 6 compares the predicted and measured water depth histories at four locations together with an ensemble of the results with different β values the darker grey lines represent results with larger values of β two features are obvious in these plots one is that a higher β value prevents oscillations as previously noted numerical oscillations are most pronounced in the result for the point located at the downstream region when the value of β is relatively small as shown in fig 6 d while the largest β value produces the smoothest curve the second feature is that the predicted water depth in the reservoir increases with the growth of β differences in the simulated water depth are biggest at point x 1 m y 1 m up to 0 18 m while this difference is smallest at point x 1 8 m y 1 44 m with only a 0 02 m difference over the range of β from 0 0 to 2 0 5 steady flow over frictional bed 5 1 one dimensional case the scenario considered here is trans critical flow over an irregular channel bed fig 7 shows the topography of the channel bottom with the exact bed coordinates given by tseng 2004 in this case the bed profile remains unchanged in the direction normal to the page to enable a 1 d analysis the total length of the channel is 1600 m with a grid size of 8 m the manning roughness coefficient considered here is 0 033 s m1 3 a constant unit width discharge of either 1 18 m2 s or 0 59 m2 s is imposed at the upstream boundary and the water depth is fixed at the end of downstream at 0 42 m the conditions of the flow are similar to what might arise in a mountainous river where the terrain is complex and steep the flow over such a bed profile varies rapidly with several transitions between sub critical and super critical regimes so that the case is a challenging test for numerical schemes fig 7 compares the predicted water surface elevations and respective froude numbers between the two numerical models in fig 7 a the froude number is mostly less than unity and the flow is rarely supercritical when β is set to be 1 0 the two models predict almost identical results however differences are quite noticeable for the case in which β is set to be 2 0 as shown in fig 7 b the notable discrepancies are found at a few supercritical locations for example at streamwise distances of 480 m 1080 m and 1350 m and other locations when the froude number exceeds 1 0 the two models give different results some oscillations appear in the adi model s results at these positions indicating its lack of shock capturing capability while results of the tvd model do not demonstrate these oscillations hence the increase in β value promotes the generation of spurious oscillations in adi modelling which is opposite to the finding previously obtained for the frictionless case study figs 8 and 9 show a range of water elevations predicted by the two models for a series of β values comparison between the two figures reveals how different unit width discharges lead to the different behavior of each model in general the water elevations predicted by the adi model are sensitive to the varying β value in terms of the oscillation generation apart from the change in the average water levels with the increase of β noticeable spikes in predicted water elevations occur at the steep falls of the river bed oscillations are most pronounced in the results when β is 2 0 in the current study this implies that the reduction of β value can improve the computational stability effectively and inhibit the unwanted oscillations in the adi model another general pattern is that a smaller β value results in a lower water depth in the simulation and a larger flow rate leads to bigger water depth variation for example a larger β value results in more significant spurious oscillations at x 480 m and close to the upstream boundary which can be seen in fig 9 a when the unit width discharge is 0 59 m2 s the water depth increases by 0 16 m with β increasing from 0 to 2 however at the unit width discharge of 1 18 m2 s the water depth increases by 0 29 m unlike the unsteady flow over a frictionless bed studied in the previous section where the fluid inertia is balanced by the water surface gradient the main influencing factors are bed friction and the water surface gradient in steady flow over a frictional bed because a larger β value generally leads to a larger velocity which then leads to a larger bed friction the water surface gradient should be increased to overcome the bed friction which attributes to the increased water level as β increases in figs 8 and 9 5 2 two dimensional case boscastle is a small fishing port in cornwall uk situated on the intersection of the river valency and river jordan which continues into the celtic sea as shown in fig 10 a the port s location and regional climate have left boscastle inherently vulnerable to flooding among notable floods that occurred in the past few decades the 2004 flood was the most severe flood ever recorded by the village roseveare and trapmore 2008 hr wallingford has undertaken extensive data collection from photos observations and residual evidence of the flood that occurred in 2004 due to the wealth of evidence availability this event has been an excellent study case for assessing flood simulation software wallingford 2005 with the help of the environment agency a digital elevation model dem was extracted for the boscastle area the background digital terrain model was obtained by filtering out the buildings and vegetation of the lidar elevation data then buildings and bridges were added using gis software according to the ordinance survey maps during the 2004 floods the bridge openings were blocked by debris and cars thus it would be reasonable to include only the top of the bridge deck in the dem the underwater bathymetry was merged with the dem according to the cross sectional drawings provided by halcrow group ltd the detailed procedure of generating the dem suitable for flood modelling is given by tuckley 2010 the domain was discretised into 860 by 470 grid cells the hydrological analysis gave the peak discharges at the upstream ends of the river valency and the river jordan to be 160 m3 s and 19 m3 s respectively the water level at the celtic sea boundary was specified to be 3 5 m a constant manning coefficient of 0 03 s m1 3 was set altogether the domain because the 2004 flood flow is rapid and contains steep variations the adi model cannot produce stable results without using a reduced value of β successful simulations were achieved with β values of 0 0 0 4 and 0 6 at higher β values the simulation terminated in the middle of the computation the flow through the river is illustrated by plotting the water level and bed level variations along the river centerline as shown in fig 11 a it is clear that a larger β value results in a higher predicted water surface elevation such a trend coincides well with the 1 d case study in this section confirming that when modelling steady and frictional flow phenomena a reduction in the value of β can effectively suppress the generation of unwanted oscillations in the numerical results of the adi model however this is at the cost of reducing the accuracy of the numerical model as the water elevation will be underpredicted as illustrated in fig 11 b the adi results with a larger β value generally agree better with the surveyed data 6 unsteady flow over frictional bed the findings in section 5 are seemingly opposite to those in the section 4 because of different flow conditions this implies that the boussinesq coefficient should be adjusted either up or down in order to eliminate computational oscillations in the adi models depending on the flow situations except for the high frequency oscillations the adi and tvd models predict similar overall trends in water depth and velocity variations which provides reassurance as to the correctness of the present simulations the final case considered here is based on an actual flood that occurred in the city of glasgow scotland uk on 30 july 2002 in this case the flow is unsteady and the bed is uneven and frictional the two dimensional adi model is applied to simulate the flood event over a 1 0 km 0 4 km urban catchment a 1 m resolution lidar survey was undertaken by infoterra ltd the surveyed data were processed to leave only the bare earth information and then modified according to the ordnance survey mastermap that defines the building locations road network and land use types a single set of friction coefficients was used with the manning coefficient of roads and vegetation being 0 015 s m1 3 and 0 05 s m1 3 respectively flooding at this site was caused by a burst pipe near the north east corner which can be seen in fig 12 as qin the detailed information and data on the area as well as the treatment of the boundary conditions for this case can be found in hunter et al 2008 in order to demonstrate the changes of water level clearly four reference points are selected representing the vicinity of the pipe burst the main road the minor road and the low lying region respectively the exact locations of the reference points denoted g1 g2 g3 and g4 are marked in fig 12 which is a contour map of the ground elevations fig 13 presents the time series of water elevations predicted by the adi model at the four gauging points to validate the present simulations the results obtained by the shock capturing numerical scheme in hunter et al 2008 are also plotted in fig 13 as references three conclusions can be drawn from observing this dataset first spurious oscillations are obvious when β is close to zero especially at points g2 and g4 where shallow high velocity and convergent flow happens in contrast the curves with larger β are relatively smooth indicating that a large β value may help mitigate the inherent instability of the adi model in this case study this finding corresponds well with that observed in the case studies of unsteady flow over frictionless beds secondly a general pattern can be summarised in terms of the arrival time of flood waves the smaller β value always predicts an earlier arrival of the flood wave especially for the points g1 and g3 where water accumulates giving rise to large water depths in the course of the simulation although these differences in the arrival time are only of the order of 3 or 4 min they can be deemed significant given the short duration of the flooding event thirdly the peak flood depth is not sensitive to the value of β differences in the maximum predicted water elevation are only obvious for point g2 up to only 8 cm when the value of β ranges from 0 0 to 2 0 hence the variation in β for this test case does not significantly alter the water depth the inundation extent is another important parameter when assessing the flood fig 14 depicts the inundated areas of the unban catchment in the backdrop of the three dimensional topography 24 min after the initiation of the flood at this moment the flood has spread through the main roads and streets reaching the lower part of the region located at about x 180 m water travels mainly along roads and streets since they have a relatively small roughness value and a low ground level compared with the neighbouring land features some rather fragmented arrangements of the wet and dry patches are notable in fig 14 a with a smaller value of β it may therefore be said that even small numerical oscillations may have a large effect on shallow flow depths thus resulting in a fragmented pattern of inundation as β increases these anomalies disappear and the inundation extent gradually decreases as shown in fig 14 b such phenomena are correspondingly quantified in fig 15 where the impact of modifying β on the inundated area is shown in detail at 4 instants it implies that the flood front propagation slows down and the flooded area gradually reduces as the value of β increases over a frictionless bed the inundated area is overpredicted for increased values of β as seen in fig 4 the reverse occurs when the bed friction is significant as seen in figs 14 and 15 for unsteady flow over a frictional bed the fluid inertia water surface gradient and bed friction are all potentially important factors as an increase in β is accompanied by increased velocity and bed friction a larger water surface gradient will then be required to overcome the bed friction with a fixed water level difference to drive the flow a larger β value may counterintuitively lead to slower propagation of the flood front over a frictional bed 7 conclusions in this paper the consequences of modifying the β value in modelling rapid flows have been assessed in a wide range of flow conditions firstly comparison is made between the adi and tvd maccormack models concerning 1 d and 2 d dam break floods over frictionless and flat beds in these cases the results suggest that the amplitude of the spurious oscillations decreases with the increase of the boussinesq coefficient hence use of a large β value helps the adi model to overcome its inherent instability when simulating rapidly varying dam break flows it is also found that increasing the value of β increases the propagation speed of flood waves when modelling unsteady flows over a frictionless bed however opposite results are observed for steady flows with a frictional bed the results in these situations suggest that the amplitude of the spurious oscillations decreases with the decrease of the boussinesq coefficient meanwhile the steady water surface elevation is predicted to be lower with a smaller β value finally the simulation of a flash flood over a complex urban terrain has been studied and the impact of the β coefficient on the solution of the adi model is further examined for unsteady flow over a frictional bed the results indicate that increase in the boussinesq coefficient can significantly reduce the amplitude of the numerical oscillations in the adi simulations the inundated area gradually reduces as the coefficient increases these results show the complicated relationship between the β value and the computational results which depends on whether the flow is steady or unsteady and whether the bed is frictionless or frictional the findings

7426,past studies modeling stream aquifer interaction commonly account for vertical anisotropy in hydraulic conductivity but rarely address horizontal anisotropy which may exist in certain sedimentary environments if present horizontal anisotropy will greatly impact stream depletion and the amount of recharge a pumped aquifer captures from the river this scenario requires a different and somewhat more sophisticated mathematical approach to model and interpret pumping test results than previous models used to describe captured recharge from rivers in this study a new mathematical model is developed to describe the spatiotemporal distribution of drawdown from stream bank pumping with a well screened across a horizontally anisotropic confined aquifer laterally bounded by a river this new model is used to estimate four aquifer parameters including the magnitude and directions of major and minor principal transmissivities and storativity based on the observed drawdown time curves within a minimum of three non collinear observation wells in order to approve the efficacy of the new model a matlab script file is programmed to conduct a four parameter inversion to estimate the four parameters of concern by comparing the results of analytical and numerical inversions the accuracy of estimated results from both inversions is acceptable but the matlab program sometimes becomes problematic because of the difficulty of separating the local minima from the global minima it appears that the new analytical model of this study is applicable and robust in estimating parameter values for a horizontally anisotropic aquifer laterally bounded by a stream besides that the new model calculates stream depletion rate as a function of stream bank pumping unique to horizontally anisotropic and homogeneous aquifers the stream depletion rate at any given pumping rate depends closely on the horizontal anisotropy ratio and the direction of the principle transmissivities relative to the stream bank keywords horizontal anisotropy stream depletion pumping test bank infiltration 1 introduction groundwater commonly closely interacts with surface water including streams lakes and wetlands winter 1998 groundwater surface water interactions including transient bank storage and long term fluxes between rivers and aquifers are an important component of hydrological budgets and have substantial impacts on socioeconomics and geopolitics butler et al 2001 because of concerns about stream restoration groundwater over exploitation and other various environmental and social problems interactions between groundwater and streams have attracted much attention from hydrologists for many decades groundwater stream interactions can primarily proceed in two ways 1 groundwater recharges the stream through the streambed baseflow when the water table in the adjacent aquifer is greater than stream stage 2 stream water recharges the aquifer when the stream stage has a higher head than the adjacent aquifer sophocleous 2002 kalbus et al 2006 these are commonly referred in the literature to as gaining and losing streams respectively in some watersheds groundwater can provide 50 80 of annual stream flow which also carries significant amounts of nutrients to aquatic animals and plants hill 1990 around the world increasing stream bank aquifer pumping driven by increasing water demand has caused natural groundwater stream interactions to change wada et al 2010 when a production well is continuously pumped near a stream the cone of depression extends gradually and eventually intercepts the stream when the hydraulic head within the stream bank aquifer is lower than the stream stage water will flow from the stream to the aquifer which is called stream depletion or induced recharge jenkins 1968 gave an explicit definition of stream depletion as either direct depletion from the stream or reduction of natural baseflow or irrigation return flow to the stream compared with natural conditions stream depletion may negatively impact aquatic ecosystems and limit the availability of surface water the quality and aesthetic value of streams and cause other water resource management issues barlow and leake 2012 stream depletion is a serious problem in many states in united states such as non point source contamination and reduction of streamflow in summers that could negatively impact the fish and wildlife resources sophocleous et al 1988 chen 2007 bradford and heinonen 2008 in addition to the united states regions in south america north africa middle east southern europe india pakistan and north east china also have severe stream depletion problems wada et al 2010 foglia et al 2013 besides stream depletion issues determination of aquifer properties including transmissivity storativity and the degree of connection to a surface water body based on pumping test data is a common practice among hydrogeological investigations in many previous studies endeavoring to quantify the loss of stream flow from aquifer pumping the aquifer is often assumed to be homogeneous and horizontally isotropic theis 1941 glover and balmer 1954 hantush 1965 hunt 1999 butler et al 2001 sun and zhan 2007 whereas vertical anisotropy is commonly explicitly modeled chen and yin 1999 chen 2000 chen and yin 2001 chen and shu 2002 chen and chen 2003 chen 2004 maroney and rehmann 2017 horizontal anisotropy has rarely been considered except in a limited number of investigations huang et al 2016 this is likely partially due to the fact that horizontal anisotropy is less frequently encountered than vertical anisotropy for example in alluvial sediments which commonly comprise aquifers adjacent to rivers measured and modeled vertical hydraulic anisotropy ranges from 10 johnson and morris 1962 to 10 000 michael and voss 2008 2009 and tends to increase with scale of the modeled system of aquifers and aquitards johnson and morris 1962 michael and voss 2008 2009 knappett et al 2016 however horizontal anisotropy may be developed in several geological settings different controlling factors such as sediment deposition rate deposition environment shape and orientation of sediment particles can preclude the formation of a horizontally isotropic aquifer quiñones aponte 1989 for example stoner 1981 found substantial horizontal anisotropy in montana which was resulted from the exhibition of a systematic set of fractures oriented perpendicular to the bedding thick coal beds stoner measured average maximum and minimum hydraulic conductivities were 0 65 and 0 26 m day respectively in addition as part of a u s geological survey program quiñones aponte 1989 performed an aquifer test in salinas alluvial fan in the southern part of puerto rico and used two different optimization procedures ordinary and weighted least squares methods ols and wls to estimate the horizontal anisotropy of the study area and the estimated aquifer parameters from these two methods were different for example the estimated horizontal anisotropy ration from ols and wls were 2 94 and 1 62 respectively simultaneously drawdown data simulated by wls was closer to actual drawdown data than the one simulated by ols horizontal anisotropy introduces challenges in interpreting pumping test data especially in the vicinity of a stream that is potentially connected to the aquifer for instance theoretically only two wells are required one pumping well and one observation well to determine aquifer parameters of a horizontally isotropic aquifer however as many as four wells may be required one pumping well and three non collinear observation wells to determine properties of a horizontally anisotropic aquifer as pointed out by papadopulos 1965 and hantush 1966 neuman et al 1984 proposed an improved scheme of interpreting pumping test data in a horizontally anisotropic aquifer in which only three wells were needed recently cook and barlas 2014 performed four pumping tests in pennsylvania and used statistical tests to determine the direction and magnitude of principal transmissivity some other studies addressing groundwater flow in horizontally anisotropic aquifers include those of lebbe and de breuck 1997 mathias and butler 2007 wen et al 2010 and cihan et al 2014 unfortunately the aforementioned investigations on horizontal anisotropy papadopulos 1965 hantush 1966 neuman et al 1984 cook and barlas 2014 did not consider the influence of the stream and thus could not be applied to deal with stream depletion and interpretation of stream bank pumping tests the objective of this paper is to develop a new mathematical model to describe the spatiotemporal distribution of drawdown from a pumping test conducted near a stream in a confined horizontally anisotropic aquifer and to provide simple interpretative procedures for analyzing pumping test data in such an aquifer additionally a new equation is established to calculate stream depletion rates caused by pumping from an adjacent horizontally anisotropic aquifer to the authors knowledge this is the first published analytical solution quantifying captured recharge from a stream by a production well pumping within a confined aquifer with horizontal anisotropy 2 conceptual model the conceptual model of the problem is shown in fig 1 to simplify the problem the stream is assumed to be an ideal recharge boundary irb which is well connected across the entire aquifer thickness and can thus be considered as a straight line with constant hydraulic head singh 2002 if a semi permeable river bed exists the river cannot be treated as an irb and is instead often treated as a general head boundary ghb the discussion of ghb is beyond the scope of this work and will be pursued in a future study near the stream a production well with a constant pumping rate is assumed to fully penetrate the aquifer the hydraulic characteristics of the studied confined aquifer are homogeneous and horizontally anisotropic fig 1 since the aquifer thickness is assumed to be constant and vertical anisotropy is assumed to be absent the conceptual model can be presented in planar view fig 2 the major and minor principal transmissivities are tα and tβ respectively and t α t β where t α t β is satisfied for the special case of an isotropic aquifer the orthogonal x and y axes describe the working coordinate system the y axis is parallel with the stream the α and β are the orthogonal axes of the principal coordinate system the directions of α and β are consistent with the direction of t α and t β respectively the α axis forms an angle θ with the x axis and is positive if the α axis is oriented counter clockwise from the x axis and negative if the α axis is clockwise from the x axis both coordinate systems share the same origin at which the pumping well is located the geometric relationship between these two sets of coordinate systems satisfies 1 α x cos θ y sin θ β x sin θ y cos θ if the shortest distance between the pumping well and the stream is denoted as l and the stream intercepts the α and β axes at a 0

modeled by adding an image recharge well injecting water at the same rate that the production well is extracting the image recharge well is symmetrically located directly across the stream from the production well since the shortest distance between the pumping well and the stream is denoted as l in the xy coordinate system then the coordinate of the image recharge well in the α β coordinate system is 2 l 2 a 2 l 2 b after some simple geometric manipulation see appendix a for details based on above preparation the drawdown equation can be derived this is first established in the α β

be transformed first back to the αβ coordinate system and then to the xy coordinate system the detailed transformation procedures are explained in appendix a the final equation of drawdown caused by

observation well in the xy coordinate system eq 14 will serve as the fundamental working equation for the following analysis eq 14 and its associated terms described in eqs 15 17 should be computationally efficient to solve on modern desktop computers in theory parameter estimation approach using standard analytical or numerical methods is expected to be computationally efficient as well however very different from the theis model theis 1941 for a horizontally isotropic aquifer where only two aquifer parameters transmissivity and storativity are estimated four aquifer parameters magnitude and direction of the principal transmissivities and storativity have to be estimated simultaneously in this study which requires some special procedures that will be explained in section 4 it is significant to point out that eq 14 works for confined aquifers but the same procedure can be extended to leaky confined or unconfined aquifers for instance if a horizontally anisotropic leaky confined aquifer is under study then one only needs to replace the two theis well functions in eq 14 by the two corresponding leaky well functions or hantush jacob well function as commonly seen in hydrogeology textbooks such as domenico and schwartz 1998 similarly if an unconfined horizontally anisotropic aquifer is under study the two theis well functions in eq 14 can be replaced by two corresponding unconfined well functions or neuman well functions such extensions are straightforward and will not be repeated here for an aquifer with known physical properties drawdown can be calculated with eq 14 forward modeling similarly for an aquifer with unknown physical properties these can be estimated with eq 14 inverse modeling in the following section parameter estimation processes will be discussed this is quite different from the conventional theis solution interpretation because four parameters must be determined within a horizontally anisotropic aquifer two principal transmissivities storativity and the angle between the major principal transmissivity direction and the x axis in contrast only two parameters need to be determined within a horizontally isotropic aquifer t and s 4 parameter estimation for a horizontally anisotropic aquifer there are two primary approaches to estimate aquifer parameters one approach is employing a multi variable numerical inversion program the other approach is using an analytical inversion model walton 2007 p 86 in this study based on the eqs 14 17 an analytical inversion procedure is developed to interpret the drawdown time data to obtain values of four parameters for a horizontally anisotropic aquifer laterally bounded by a stream additionally for the purpose of comparison a matlab script file is programmed to conduct the numerical inversion to estimate the values of four parameters of concern in section 5 2 the details of the analytical inversion is listed as follows in general observed drawdown in at least one observation well induced from a well pumped at a known rate is used to estimate aquifer properties through inverse modeling for a horizontally isotropic aquifer this approach can also be performed for estimating aquifer parameters magnitude and direction of major and minor principal transmissivities and storativity of a horizontally anisotropic aquifer however with at least three non collinear observation wells papadopulos 1965 hantush 1966 fig 4 the variables r 1 r 2 and r 3 are the radial distances between the pumping well and each of the three observation wells the angle between the major principal transmissivity direction α axis and r 1 is η where the bolded r herein denotes a radial vector the angles between r 1 and r 2 and r 1 and r 3 are ξ and γ respectively a positive η means that the r 1 is oriented counter clockwise from the α axis conversely a negative η means that r 1 is oriented clockwise from the α axis the same sign notation is used for ξ and γ firstly define a new parameter ɛ r 2 r 1 based on the infinite series form of theis function when the pumping time is large enough which satisfies ε 2 u r 1 0 1 eq 14 can be approximated as hantush 1959 18 s q 4 π t e 2 ln ε ε 2 1 r 1 2 s 4 t e t ε 4 1 r 1 2 s 4 t e 2 2 2 t 2 eq 18 is valid for confined aquifers when the pumped aquifer is unconfined and the large time behavior is of concern the theis well function cannot be used to describe the drawdown distribution since it invalidates eq 18 but one can use a modified version of eq 18 instead of using the complex unconfined well function to interpret the drawdown data from unconfined aquifer to do so the first modification is to replace s by the specific yield sy in eq 18 the second modification is to substitute the actual drawdown s with the corrected drawdown s hantush 1959 19 s s s 2 2 d where d is the initial saturated thickness of the unconfined aquifer the prerequisite for using eq 19 is that s 0 25d hantush 1959 when s 0 25d t e cannot be approximated as constants and will vary with drawdowns this condition is beyond the scope of this work secondly we will present the theoretical background and a procedure for interpreting observed drawdown curves in three monitoring wells located near a pumping well when drawdown is plotted against log t an inflection point is evident in the curve fig 5 a at which the second derivative of eq 14 with respect to log t equals to zero at this inflection point the slope m 1 is kruseman et al 1994 p 118 20 u r 1 2 ln ε ε 2 1 21 m 1 2 303 q 4 π t e e u r 1 e ε 2 u r 1 additionally the maximum drawdown sm is also related to ε as hantush 1959 22 s m 2 303 q 2 π t e log ε therefore the ratio of sm versus m 1 is only related to ε as 23 s m m 1 2 log ε e u r 1 e ε 2 u r 1 one can see from fig 5 b that the curve intercepts the vertical axis at sm and the slope at this intercept is mt which satisfies batu 1998 p 576 24 m t q 4 π t e ε 2 1 r 1 2 s 4 t e substituting eq 22 and eq 24 into eq 18 leads to 25 s s m m t t c t 2 where 26 c q 4 π t e ε 4 1 r 1 4 s 2 64 t e 2 the value of m 1 can be approximated by the slope of the tangent to the drawdown curve at the inflection point fig 5a batu 1998 the maximum drawdown sm equals to the fitted intercept term in eq 25 based on the estimated m 1 and sm ε can be estimated from eq 23 next based on the estimated ε and sm te can be calculated from eq 22 furthermore the value of u r 1 at the inflection point can be calculated by substituting the obtained ε into eq 20 the drawdown at the inflection point si can then be determined by substituting u r 1 and ε into eq 14 using the calculated si the inflection point on the drawdown time curve can be located at fig 5a to obtain the corresponding time ti these obtained values u r 1 and ti are needed in the following analysis thirdly for a horizontally anisotropic aquifer one may also write 27 u r 1 r 1 2 s 4 t r 1 t r 1 2 4 d 1 t where r 1 is the radial distance between the first observation well and pumping well t r 1 is the corresponding radial transmissivity in the r 1 direction and d 1 t r 1 s is the hydraulic diffusivity in the r 1 direction as ti and u r 1 at the inflection point have been obtained one can calculate d 1 based on eq 27 28 d 1 r 1 2 4 u r 1 t i using the same procedure hydraulic diffusivity values in the directions of the second d 2 and the third d 3 observation wells can be calculated the equation used to calculate η is listed in appendix b see eq b1 considering the properties of the tangent function involved in solving η there will be two values of η which are deviated by 90 to find out which η value to choose one can define a new parameter χ as follows 29 χ t α t β t e t β 2 the method of solving χ is shown in eq b2 in appendix b as defined previously t α is the major transmissivity and t β is the minor one thus χ 1 is used for the horizontally isotropic case therefore the value of η that results in χ 1 in eq b2 is the correct value based on the value of η and direction of r 1 from the x axis the angle of the major transmissivity axis from the x axis θ is then obtained based on the obtained χ te and eq 29 tα and tβ can be found after that s for a confined aquifer or s y for an unconfined aquifer can be determined according to the definition of hydraulic diffusivity thus following the above procedures values of the four parameters tα tβ s or sy and θ can be solved radial transmissivities in r 1 r 2 and r 3 directions can further be calculated see eq b3 in appendix b the following example illustrates an application of the analytical model using the theoretical approach described above 5 example calculation a careful check of literature revealed that stream bank pumping tests that specifically consider horizontal anisotropy have not been reported therefore to put the parameter estimation processes proposed above into action a synthetic horizontally anisotropic and confined aquifer is established with the following parameters the storativity is assumed to be 3 10 3 the major and minor transmissivities are assumed to be 8 640 and 1 728 m2 day respectively domenico and schwartz 1998 the aquifer thickness is 10 m a production well pumping at a rate of 100 m3 day is located 20 m away from the river both the pumping well and the river fully penetrate the pumped aquifer the angle between the direction of major transmissivity tα and the x axis is arbitrarily set as 60 the distribution of four observation wells ow 1 ow 2 ow 3 and ow 4 is shown in fig 6 eq 14 was used to generate the drawdown time curves at four observation wells forward modeling after that aquifer properties were estimated based on the drawdown time data from arbitrary three observation wells along with knowledge of the constant pumping rate and the location of the observation wells in respect to the pumping well inverse modeling in theory one should recover the same value of the input parameters used to generate the synthetic drawdown time data if the parameter estimation procedure works 5 1 pumping test data interpretation first eq 14 was used to calculate drawdown time curves for all four observation wells in semi logarithmic space fig 7 one can see from fig 7 that the overall drawdown time curves follow s shapes similar to that in fig 5 a for observation wells ow 2 and ow 3 the drawdown curves have the same radial distances from the pumping well and the same shortest distance from the steam fig 6 thus in an isotropic aquifer these two observation wells should have the same drawdown time curves in addition the coordinates of ow 2 and ow 3 are symmetric with respect to the x axis the drawdown time curves from these two wells should be the same if the principal coordinate system αβ coincides with the working coordinate system xy however as evident in fig 7 there is a significant difference between the drawdown time curves for these two wells the drawdown difference is 2 5 m when reaching the pseudo steady state therefore horizontal anisotropy clearly affects the drawdown distribution the pseudo steady state concept basically means that the hydraulic head may still vary with time but the groundwater flow velocity is approaching its steady state value a typical example of pseudo steady state is the theis model for describing drawdown in a confined aquifer theis 1941 in the theis model drawdown continuously increases with time near the pumping well but the flow velocity will approach its steady state value determined by the pumping rate per unit aquifer thickness the distance from the well and the aquifer effective porosity after a sufficiently long period of time drawdown data generated from eq 14 are now regarded as real observed data and are used to analyze aquifer parameters as mentioned in section 4 at least three observation wells are needed to estimate aquifer parameters therefore ow 1 ow 2 and ow 4 are chosen for the following analysis using ow 1 as an example the best fit quadratic equation for drawdown versus 1 t eq 25 can be derived using a standard statistical regression method such as sas excel or matlab and the value of sm is found to be 3 690 m then from the drawdown versus logarithm time curve plotted by drawdown data from ow 1 the slope of the straight portion of this curve is found to be m 1 2 67 after getting the values of sm and m 1 the other related parameters can all be calculated based on the procedure explained in section 4 and the results are listed in table 1 the same procedures can be applied to drawdown time curves of ow 2 and ow 4 and the related results are also listed in table 1 combining the obtained value of hydraulic diffusivity with eq b1 the angle between the major transmissivity axis and r 1 η is solved the appropriate value of η should be the one that makes χ 1 substituting the correct χ value into eq 29 the principal transmissivities tα and tβ are found to be tα 9 779 and tβ 1 881 m2 day respectively combining the obtained values of tα tβ and the hydraulic diffusivity s is found to be 3 10 3 after the completion of the analytical inversion procedure the third row in table 2 lists the interpreted values of four parameters and the second row in table 3 summarizes the discrepancies between the interpreted and the true values one can see that the discrepancies for s and θ are negligible less than 1 the discrepancies for tα and tβ are l3 1 and 8 8 respectively such discrepancies are generally acceptable for pumping test interpretation in which an order of magnitude uncertainty for the estimated parameters is commonly seen cheong et al 2008 hunt et al 2001 li et al 2014 the causes for the discrepancies of tα and tβ probably come from the errors associated with the determination of sm in fig 5b and m1 in fig 5a although discrepancies of transmissivities cannot be neglected the ratio of horizontal anisotropy tα tβ derived from analyzed transmissivities is much closed to the real value therefore the analyzed aquifer parameters can adequately reflect aquifer s horizontal anisotropy and the newly proposed method in this work is valuable for practical usage 5 2 comparison of the analytical and numerical inversions in this study we have programed a matlab script file to conduct a four parameter inversion to estimate the four parameters of concern and to compare the estimated results with their counterparts obtained from section 5 1 using the analytical inversion procedure there are several different built in solvers in matlab that can process nonlinear data fitting lsqcurvefit is one of these solvers and is employed in this study this solver is based on a least square framework and tries to find the best fitted parameter values that can minimize the squared error between the original data and the counterparts calculated by fitted parameters the estimated parameter values and the associated error percentages from the matlab script file are listed in the last rows of tables 2 and 3 respectively as listed in table 3 the error percentages of tα and tβ obtained from matlab are both lower than 5 the estimations of s and θ are not as good as those obtained from the analytical inversion but the estimated results are still acceptable as shown in table 2 both the analytical inversion and the numerical inversion using matlab can estimate four parameters simultaneously and the error percentages of these two methods are similar to each other one disadvantage of the matlab program is that it sometimes becomes problematic for separating the local minima from the global minima the method becomes particularly less reliable when the initial guess values of the parameters are far from their true values and or the allocated ranges of variation of the parameters are too large in the inversion this issue will impose limitations on the use of the matlab inversion program in practice because one does not know the true values before the completion of the inversion in order to avoid being trapped in the local minima the methods of simulated annealing and tabu search may be used to find global minima zheng and wang 1996 lin et al 2001 tung and chou 2002 jha and datta 2012 the basic idea of these two numerical techniques is to mimic certain natural systems simulated annealing is an analogy with thermodynamics and the tabu search is based on a human memory process these two numerical techniques have been used in groundwater inverse modeling such as lin et al 2001 tung and chou 2002 and jha and datta 2012 in the future these techniques can be adopted to improve the reliability of numerical inversion of parameter values of a horizontally anisotropic aquifer nevertheless based on the above discussion the analytical inversion proposed in this study appears to be robust and reliable as it is free from the limitations outlined in the matlab inversion program 5 3 stream depletion calculation another application of this study is to calculate the stream depletion based on eq 14 as a function of pumping rate and horizontal anisotropy the total stream depletion rate qd over the entire stream during a given time t should be the integral of flow per unit stream reach along the entire stream reach glover and balmer 1954 30 q d q x l dy where qx l is the flow per unit stream reach and it is calculated via darcy s law 31 q x l t xx s x x l t xy s y x l to investigate the effect of horizontal anisotropy on stream depletion the values of t α t β and θ were varied a greater horizontal anisotropy ratio of t α t β is predicted to lead to a higher stream depletion rate fig 8 a when t α t β equals to 50 the depletion rate under pseudo steady state conditions is about 48 m3 day whereas this depletion rate is 45 m3 day when tα tβ is 5 although the stream depletion rate does not show large differences under three scenarios described in fig 8a the total stream depletion amounts are significantly different for such three scenarios for example when the stream depletion rate reaches steady state the difference of the total depletion amounts during a 30 day pumping period for t α t β 50 and t α t β 5 is 90 m3 therefore one can conclude that horizontal anisotropy ratio has moderate impact on stream depletion amount for the example shown in fig 8 a in addition as shown in fig 8 b when θ varies from 0 to 90 the depletion rate decreases considerably the difference of stream depletion rate between 0 and 90 reaches to 7 m3 day which suggests that stream depletion rates are sensitive to the principal transmissivity direction 5 4 discussion the derived drawdown equation and related parameter estimation procedures are based on a series of assumptions which may limit the usage of this approach several future studies can be carried out on the basis of this work with the purpose of expanding the current knowledge for investigating horizontally anisotropic aquifers firstly in this work the stream is simplified into a straight line and without considering its width future work can take the stream width into account for instance one can make use of the study by zlotnik et al 1999 who derived an analytical solution for stream depletion with a finite stream width in an isotropic aquifer secondly streams may only partially penetrate the aquifer such as streams in the great plains zlotnik and huang 1999 the application of this study to a partially penetrating stream will result in the overestimation of stream depletion rate chen and yin 2004 therefore future work could also incorporate this factor into consideration zlotnik and tartakovsky 2008 baalousha 2012 additionally hydraulic disconnection between the stream and the groundwater and semi permeable barrier between the streambed and surrounding aquifer are possible in actual applications and should be accommodated in future studies darama 2001 singh 2003 brunner et al 2011 6 conclusions drawdown in observation wells are predicted to be substantially different for a horizontally anisotropic confined aquifer compared to horizontally isotropic based on the newly derived equations the direction of principal transmissivity and anisotropic ratio within a horizontally anisotropic aquifer laterally bounded by a stream considerably impact the distribution of drawdown in space and time and stream depletion rates a straightforward inverse analytical method is developed to estimate aquifer properties based on drawdown time curves collected at minimum three non collinear observation wells this method is easy to use and can determine four parameters of a horizontally anisotropic confined aquifer simultaneously including two principal transmissivity values storativity and the direction of the major principal transmissivity the analytical inversion method proposed in this study is compared with a four parameter numerical inversion scheme in a matlab script file programed by the authors although similar inversion results are obtained the matlab program may become problematic for separating the local minima from the global minima if the initial guess values and or the variational ranges of parameters are not properly chosen the analytical inversion method proposed in this study however appears to be robust and reliable for aquifer parameter estimations the analytical inverse method of this study is applied to interpret a synthetic pumping test data set and the predicted values are acceptable in the range of allowable errors

7426,past studies modeling stream aquifer interaction commonly account for vertical anisotropy in hydraulic conductivity but rarely address horizontal anisotropy which may exist in certain sedimentary environments if present horizontal anisotropy will greatly impact stream depletion and the amount of recharge a pumped aquifer captures from the river this scenario requires a different and somewhat more sophisticated mathematical approach to model and interpret pumping test results than previous models used to describe captured recharge from rivers in this study a new mathematical model is developed to describe the spatiotemporal distribution of drawdown from stream bank pumping with a well screened across a horizontally anisotropic confined aquifer laterally bounded by a river this new model is used to estimate four aquifer parameters including the magnitude and directions of major and minor principal transmissivities and storativity based on the observed drawdown time curves within a minimum of three non collinear observation wells in order to approve the efficacy of the new model a matlab script file is programmed to conduct a four parameter inversion to estimate the four parameters of concern by comparing the results of analytical and numerical inversions the accuracy of estimated results from both inversions is acceptable but the matlab program sometimes becomes problematic because of the difficulty of separating the local minima from the global minima it appears that the new analytical model of this study is applicable and robust in estimating parameter values for a horizontally anisotropic aquifer laterally bounded by a stream besides that the new model calculates stream depletion rate as a function of stream bank pumping unique to horizontally anisotropic and homogeneous aquifers the stream depletion rate at any given pumping rate depends closely on the horizontal anisotropy ratio and the direction of the principle transmissivities relative to the stream bank keywords horizontal anisotropy stream depletion pumping test bank infiltration 1 introduction groundwater commonly closely interacts with surface water including streams lakes and wetlands winter 1998 groundwater surface water interactions including transient bank storage and long term fluxes between rivers and aquifers are an important component of hydrological budgets and have substantial impacts on socioeconomics and geopolitics butler et al 2001 because of concerns about stream restoration groundwater over exploitation and other various environmental and social problems interactions between groundwater and streams have attracted much attention from hydrologists for many decades groundwater stream interactions can primarily proceed in two ways 1 groundwater recharges the stream through the streambed baseflow when the water table in the adjacent aquifer is greater than stream stage 2 stream water recharges the aquifer when the stream stage has a higher head than the adjacent aquifer sophocleous 2002 kalbus et al 2006 these are commonly referred in the literature to as gaining and losing streams respectively in some watersheds groundwater can provide 50 80 of annual stream flow which also carries significant amounts of nutrients to aquatic animals and plants hill 1990 around the world increasing stream bank aquifer pumping driven by increasing water demand has caused natural groundwater stream interactions to change wada et al 2010 when a production well is continuously pumped near a stream the cone of depression extends gradually and eventually intercepts the stream when the hydraulic head within the stream bank aquifer is lower than the stream stage water will flow from the stream to the aquifer which is called stream depletion or induced recharge jenkins 1968 gave an explicit definition of stream depletion as either direct depletion from the stream or reduction of natural baseflow or irrigation return flow to the stream compared with natural conditions stream depletion may negatively impact aquatic ecosystems and limit the availability of surface water the quality and aesthetic value of streams and cause other water resource management issues barlow and leake 2012 stream depletion is a serious problem in many states in united states such as non point source contamination and reduction of streamflow in summers that could negatively impact the fish and wildlife resources sophocleous et al 1988 chen 2007 bradford and heinonen 2008 in addition to the united states regions in south america north africa middle east southern europe india pakistan and north east china also have severe stream depletion problems wada et al 2010 foglia et al 2013 besides stream depletion issues determination of aquifer properties including transmissivity storativity and the degree of connection to a surface water body based on pumping test data is a common practice among hydrogeological investigations in many previous studies endeavoring to quantify the loss of stream flow from aquifer pumping the aquifer is often assumed to be homogeneous and horizontally isotropic theis 1941 glover and balmer 1954 hantush 1965 hunt 1999 butler et al 2001 sun and zhan 2007 whereas vertical anisotropy is commonly explicitly modeled chen and yin 1999 chen 2000 chen and yin 2001 chen and shu 2002 chen and chen 2003 chen 2004 maroney and rehmann 2017 horizontal anisotropy has rarely been considered except in a limited number of investigations huang et al 2016 this is likely partially due to the fact that horizontal anisotropy is less frequently encountered than vertical anisotropy for example in alluvial sediments which commonly comprise aquifers adjacent to rivers measured and modeled vertical hydraulic anisotropy ranges from 10 johnson and morris 1962 to 10 000 michael and voss 2008 2009 and tends to increase with scale of the modeled system of aquifers and aquitards johnson and morris 1962 michael and voss 2008 2009 knappett et al 2016 however horizontal anisotropy may be developed in several geological settings different controlling factors such as sediment deposition rate deposition environment shape and orientation of sediment particles can preclude the formation of a horizontally isotropic aquifer quiñones aponte 1989 for example stoner 1981 found substantial horizontal anisotropy in montana which was resulted from the exhibition of a systematic set of fractures oriented perpendicular to the bedding thick coal beds stoner measured average maximum and minimum hydraulic conductivities were 0 65 and 0 26 m day respectively in addition as part of a u s geological survey program quiñones aponte 1989 performed an aquifer test in salinas alluvial fan in the southern part of puerto rico and used two different optimization procedures ordinary and weighted least squares methods ols and wls to estimate the horizontal anisotropy of the study area and the estimated aquifer parameters from these two methods were different for example the estimated horizontal anisotropy ration from ols and wls were 2 94 and 1 62 respectively simultaneously drawdown data simulated by wls was closer to actual drawdown data than the one simulated by ols horizontal anisotropy introduces challenges in interpreting pumping test data especially in the vicinity of a stream that is potentially connected to the aquifer for instance theoretically only two wells are required one pumping well and one observation well to determine aquifer parameters of a horizontally isotropic aquifer however as many as four wells may be required one pumping well and three non collinear observation wells to determine properties of a horizontally anisotropic aquifer as pointed out by papadopulos 1965 and hantush 1966 neuman et al 1984 proposed an improved scheme of interpreting pumping test data in a horizontally anisotropic aquifer in which only three wells were needed recently cook and barlas 2014 performed four pumping tests in pennsylvania and used statistical tests to determine the direction and magnitude of principal transmissivity some other studies addressing groundwater flow in horizontally anisotropic aquifers include those of lebbe and de breuck 1997 mathias and butler 2007 wen et al 2010 and cihan et al 2014 unfortunately the aforementioned investigations on horizontal anisotropy papadopulos 1965 hantush 1966 neuman et al 1984 cook and barlas 2014 did not consider the influence of the stream and thus could not be applied to deal with stream depletion and interpretation of stream bank pumping tests the objective of this paper is to develop a new mathematical model to describe the spatiotemporal distribution of drawdown from a pumping test conducted near a stream in a confined horizontally anisotropic aquifer and to provide simple interpretative procedures for analyzing pumping test data in such an aquifer additionally a new equation is established to calculate stream depletion rates caused by pumping from an adjacent horizontally anisotropic aquifer to the authors knowledge this is the first published analytical solution quantifying captured recharge from a stream by a production well pumping within a confined aquifer with horizontal anisotropy 2 conceptual model the conceptual model of the problem is shown in fig 1 to simplify the problem the stream is assumed to be an ideal recharge boundary irb which is well connected across the entire aquifer thickness and can thus be considered as a straight line with constant hydraulic head singh 2002 if a semi permeable river bed exists the river cannot be treated as an irb and is instead often treated as a general head boundary ghb the discussion of ghb is beyond the scope of this work and will be pursued in a future study near the stream a production well with a constant pumping rate is assumed to fully penetrate the aquifer the hydraulic characteristics of the studied confined aquifer are homogeneous and horizontally anisotropic fig 1 since the aquifer thickness is assumed to be constant and vertical anisotropy is assumed to be absent the conceptual model can be presented in planar view fig 2 the major and minor principal transmissivities are tα and tβ respectively and t α t β where t α t β is satisfied for the special case of an isotropic aquifer the orthogonal x and y axes describe the working coordinate system the y axis is parallel with the stream the α and β are the orthogonal axes of the principal coordinate system the directions of α and β are consistent with the direction of t α and t β respectively the α axis forms an angle θ with the x axis and is positive if the α axis is oriented counter clockwise from the x axis and negative if the α axis is clockwise from the x axis both coordinate systems share the same origin at which the pumping well is located the geometric relationship between these two sets of

modeled by adding an image recharge well injecting water at the same rate that the production well is extracting the image recharge well is symmetrically located directly across the stream from the production well since the shortest distance between the pumping well and the stream is denoted as l in the xy coordinate system then the coordinate of the image recharge well in the α β coordinate system is 2 l 2 a 2 l 2 b after some simple geometric manipulation see appendix a for details based on above preparation the drawdown equation can be derived this is first established in the α β

computationally efficient to solve on modern desktop computers in theory parameter estimation approach using standard analytical or numerical methods is expected to be computationally efficient as well however very different from the theis model theis 1941 for a horizontally isotropic aquifer where only two aquifer parameters transmissivity and storativity are estimated four aquifer parameters magnitude and direction of the principal transmissivities and storativity have to be estimated simultaneously in this study which requires some special procedures that will be explained in section 4 it is significant to point out that eq 14 works for confined aquifers but the same procedure can be extended to leaky confined or unconfined aquifers for instance if a horizontally anisotropic leaky confined aquifer is under study then one only needs to replace the two theis well functions in eq 14 by the two corresponding leaky well functions or hantush jacob well function as commonly seen in hydrogeology textbooks such as domenico and schwartz 1998 similarly if an unconfined horizontally anisotropic aquifer is under study the two theis well functions in eq 14 can be replaced by two corresponding unconfined well functions or neuman well functions such extensions are straightforward and will not be repeated here for an aquifer with known physical properties drawdown can be calculated with eq 14 forward modeling similarly for an aquifer with unknown physical properties these can be estimated with eq 14 inverse modeling in the following section parameter estimation processes will be discussed this is quite different from the conventional theis solution interpretation because four parameters must be determined within a horizontally anisotropic aquifer two principal transmissivities storativity and the angle between the major principal transmissivity direction and the x axis in contrast only two parameters need to be determined within a horizontally isotropic aquifer t and s 4 parameter estimation for a horizontally anisotropic aquifer there are two primary approaches to estimate aquifer parameters one approach is employing a multi variable numerical inversion program the other approach is using an analytical inversion model walton 2007 p 86 in this study based on the eqs 14 17 an analytical inversion procedure is developed to interpret the drawdown time data to obtain values of four parameters for a horizontally anisotropic aquifer laterally bounded by a stream additionally for the purpose of comparison a matlab script file is programmed to conduct the numerical inversion to estimate the values of four parameters of concern in section 5 2 the details of the analytical inversion is listed as follows in general observed drawdown in at least one observation well induced from a well pumped at a known rate is used to estimate aquifer properties through inverse modeling for a horizontally isotropic aquifer this approach can also be performed for estimating aquifer parameters magnitude and direction of major and minor principal transmissivities and storativity of a horizontally anisotropic aquifer however with at least three non collinear observation wells papadopulos 1965 hantush 1966 fig 4 the variables r 1 r 2 and r 3 are the radial distances between the pumping well and each of the three observation wells the angle between the major principal transmissivity direction α axis and r 1 is η where the bolded r herein denotes a radial vector the angles between r 1 and r 2 and r 1 and r 3 are ξ and γ respectively a positive η means that the r 1 is oriented counter clockwise from the α axis conversely a negative η means that r 1 is oriented clockwise from the α axis the same sign notation is used for ξ and γ firstly define a new parameter ɛ r 2 r 1 based on the infinite series form of theis function when the pumping time is large enough which satisfies ε 2 u r 1 0 1 eq 14 can be approximated as hantush 1959 18 s q 4 π t e 2 ln ε ε 2 1 r 1 2 s 4 t e t ε 4 1 r 1 2 s 4 t e 2 2 2 t 2 eq 18 is valid for confined aquifers when the pumped aquifer is unconfined and the large time behavior is of concern the theis well function cannot be used to describe the drawdown distribution since it invalidates eq 18 but one can use a modified version of eq 18 instead of using the complex unconfined well function to interpret the drawdown data from unconfined aquifer to do so the first modification is to replace s by the specific yield sy in eq 18 the second modification is to substitute the actual drawdown s with the corrected drawdown s hantush 1959 19 s s s 2 2 d where d is the initial saturated thickness of the unconfined aquifer the prerequisite for using eq 19 is that s 0 25d hantush 1959 when s 0 25d t e cannot be approximated as constants and will vary with drawdowns this condition is beyond the scope of this work secondly we will present the theoretical background and a procedure for interpreting observed drawdown curves in three monitoring wells located near a pumping well when drawdown is plotted against log t an inflection point is evident in the curve fig 5 a at which the second derivative of eq 14 with respect to log t equals to zero at this inflection point the slope m 1 is kruseman et al 1994 p 118 20 u r 1 2 ln ε ε 2 1 21 m 1 2 303 q 4 π t e e u r 1 e ε 2 u r 1 additionally the maximum drawdown sm is also related to ε as hantush 1959 22 s m 2 303 q 2 π t e log ε therefore the ratio of sm versus m 1 is only related to ε as 23 s m m 1 2 log ε e u r 1 e ε 2 u r 1 one can see from fig 5 b that the curve intercepts the vertical axis at sm and the slope at this intercept is mt which satisfies batu 1998 p 576 24 m t q 4 π t e ε 2 1 r 1 2 s 4 t e substituting eq 22 and eq 24 into eq 18 leads to 25 s s m m t t c t 2 where 26 c q 4 π t e ε 4 1 r 1 4 s 2 64 t e 2 the value of m 1 can be approximated by the slope of the tangent to the drawdown curve at the inflection point fig 5a batu 1998 the maximum drawdown sm equals to the fitted intercept term in eq 25 based on the estimated m 1 and sm ε can be estimated from eq 23 next based on the estimated ε and sm te can be calculated from eq 22 furthermore the value of u r 1 at the inflection point can be calculated by substituting the obtained ε into eq 20 the drawdown at the inflection point si can then be determined by substituting u r 1 and ε into eq 14 using the calculated si the inflection point on the drawdown time curve can be located at fig 5a to obtain the corresponding time ti these obtained values u r 1 and ti are needed in the following analysis thirdly for a horizontally anisotropic aquifer one may also write 27 u r 1 r 1 2 s 4 t r 1 t r 1 2 4 d 1 t where r 1 is the radial distance between the first observation well and pumping well t r 1 is the corresponding radial transmissivity in the r 1 direction and d 1 t r 1 s is the hydraulic diffusivity in the r 1 direction as ti and u r 1 at the inflection point have been obtained one can calculate d 1 based on eq 27 28 d 1 r 1 2 4 u r 1 t i using the same procedure hydraulic diffusivity values in the directions of the second d 2 and the third d 3 observation wells can be calculated the equation used to calculate η is listed in appendix b see eq b1 considering the properties of the tangent function involved in solving η there will be two values of η which are deviated by 90 to find out which η value to choose one can define a new parameter χ as follows 29 χ t α t β t e t β 2 the method of solving χ is shown in eq b2 in appendix b as defined previously t α is the major transmissivity and t β is the minor one thus χ 1 is used for the horizontally isotropic case therefore the value of η that results in χ 1 in eq b2 is the correct value based on the value of η and direction of r 1 from the x axis the angle of the major transmissivity axis from the x axis θ is then obtained based on the obtained χ te and eq 29 tα and tβ can be found after that s for a confined aquifer or s y for an unconfined aquifer can be determined according to the definition of hydraulic diffusivity thus following the above procedures values of the four parameters tα tβ s or sy and θ can be solved radial transmissivities in r 1 r 2 and r 3 directions can further be calculated see eq b3 in appendix b the following example illustrates an application of the analytical model using the theoretical approach described above 5 example calculation a careful check of literature revealed that stream bank pumping tests that specifically consider horizontal anisotropy have not been reported therefore to put the parameter estimation processes proposed above into action a synthetic horizontally anisotropic and confined aquifer is established with the following parameters the storativity is assumed to be 3 10 3 the major and minor transmissivities are assumed to be 8 640 and 1 728 m2 day respectively domenico and schwartz 1998 the aquifer thickness is 10 m a production well pumping at a rate of 100 m3 day is located 20 m away from the river both the pumping well and the river fully penetrate the pumped aquifer the angle between the direction of major transmissivity tα and the x axis is arbitrarily set as 60 the distribution of four observation wells ow 1 ow 2 ow 3 and ow 4 is shown in fig 6 eq 14 was used to generate the drawdown time curves at four observation wells forward modeling after that aquifer properties were estimated based on the drawdown time data from arbitrary three observation wells along with knowledge of the constant pumping rate and the location of the observation wells in respect to the pumping well inverse modeling in theory one should recover the same value of the input parameters used to generate the synthetic drawdown time data if the parameter estimation procedure works 5 1 pumping test data interpretation first eq 14 was used to calculate drawdown time curves for all four observation wells in semi logarithmic space fig 7 one can see from fig 7 that the overall drawdown time curves follow s shapes similar to that in fig 5 a for observation wells ow 2 and ow 3 the drawdown curves have the same radial distances from the pumping well and the same shortest distance from the steam fig 6 thus in an isotropic aquifer these two observation wells should have the same drawdown time curves in addition the coordinates of ow 2 and ow 3 are symmetric with respect to the x axis the drawdown time curves from these two wells should be the same if the principal coordinate system αβ coincides with the working coordinate system xy however as evident in fig 7 there is a significant difference between the drawdown time curves for these two wells the drawdown difference is 2 5 m when reaching the pseudo steady state therefore horizontal anisotropy clearly affects the drawdown distribution the pseudo steady state concept basically means that the hydraulic head may still vary with time but the groundwater flow velocity is approaching its steady state value a typical example of pseudo steady state is the theis model for describing drawdown in a confined aquifer theis 1941 in the theis model drawdown continuously increases with time near the pumping well but the flow velocity will approach its steady state value determined by the pumping rate per unit aquifer thickness the distance from the well and the aquifer effective porosity after a sufficiently long period of time drawdown data generated from eq 14 are now regarded as real observed data and are used to analyze aquifer parameters as mentioned in section 4 at least three observation wells are needed to estimate aquifer parameters therefore ow 1 ow 2 and ow 4 are chosen for the following analysis using ow 1 as an example the best fit quadratic equation for drawdown versus 1 t eq 25 can be derived using a standard statistical regression method such as sas excel or matlab and the value of sm is found to be 3 690 m then from the drawdown versus logarithm time curve plotted by drawdown data from ow 1 the slope of the straight portion of this curve is found to be m 1 2 67 after getting the values of sm and m 1 the other related parameters can all be calculated based on the procedure explained in section 4 and the results are listed in table 1 the same procedures can be applied to drawdown time curves of ow 2 and ow 4 and the related results are also listed in table 1 combining the obtained value of hydraulic diffusivity with eq b1 the angle between the major transmissivity axis and r 1 η is solved the appropriate value of η should be the one that makes χ 1 substituting the correct χ value into eq 29 the principal transmissivities tα and tβ are found to be tα 9 779 and tβ 1 881 m2 day respectively combining the obtained values of tα tβ and the hydraulic diffusivity s is found to be 3 10 3 after the completion of the analytical inversion procedure the third row in table 2 lists the interpreted values of four parameters and the second row in table 3 summarizes the discrepancies between the interpreted and the true values one can see that the discrepancies for s and θ are negligible less than 1 the discrepancies for tα and tβ are l3 1 and 8 8 respectively such discrepancies are generally acceptable for pumping test interpretation in which an order of magnitude uncertainty for the estimated parameters is commonly seen cheong et al 2008 hunt et al 2001 li et al 2014 the causes for the discrepancies of tα and tβ probably come from the errors associated with the determination of sm in fig 5b and m1 in fig 5a although discrepancies of transmissivities cannot be neglected the ratio of horizontal anisotropy tα tβ derived from analyzed transmissivities is much closed to the real value therefore the analyzed aquifer parameters can adequately reflect aquifer s horizontal anisotropy and the newly proposed method in this work is valuable for practical usage 5 2 comparison of the analytical and numerical inversions in this study we have programed a matlab script file to conduct a four parameter inversion to estimate the four parameters of concern and to compare the estimated results with their counterparts obtained from section 5 1 using the analytical inversion procedure there are several different built in solvers in matlab that can process nonlinear data fitting lsqcurvefit is one of these solvers and is employed in this study this solver is based on a least square framework and tries to find the best fitted parameter values that can minimize the squared error between the original data and the counterparts calculated by fitted parameters the estimated parameter values and the associated error percentages from the matlab script file are listed in the last rows of tables 2 and 3 respectively as listed in table 3 the error percentages of tα and tβ obtained from matlab are both lower than 5 the estimations of s and θ are not as good as those obtained from the analytical inversion but the estimated results are still acceptable as shown in table 2 both the analytical inversion and the numerical inversion using matlab can estimate four parameters simultaneously and the error percentages of these two methods are similar to each other one disadvantage of the matlab program is that it sometimes becomes problematic for separating the local minima from the global minima the method becomes particularly less reliable when the initial guess values of the parameters are far from their true values and or the allocated ranges of variation of the parameters are too large in the inversion this issue will impose limitations on the use of the matlab inversion program in practice because one does not know the true values before the completion of the inversion in order to avoid being trapped in the local minima the methods of simulated annealing and tabu search may be used to find global minima zheng and wang 1996 lin et al 2001 tung and chou 2002 jha and datta 2012 the basic idea of these two numerical techniques is to mimic certain natural systems simulated annealing is an analogy with thermodynamics and the tabu search is based on a human memory process these two numerical techniques have been used in groundwater inverse modeling such as lin et al 2001 tung and chou 2002 and jha and datta 2012 in the future these techniques can be adopted to improve the reliability of numerical inversion of parameter values of a horizontally anisotropic aquifer nevertheless based on the above discussion the analytical inversion proposed in this study appears to be robust and reliable as it is free from the limitations outlined in the matlab inversion program 5 3 stream depletion calculation another application of this study is to calculate the stream depletion based on eq 14 as a function of pumping rate and horizontal anisotropy the total stream depletion rate qd over the entire stream during a given time t should be the integral of flow per unit stream reach along the entire stream reach glover and balmer 1954 30 q d q x l dy where qx l is the flow per unit stream reach and it is calculated via darcy s law 31 q x l t xx s x x l t xy s y x l to investigate the effect of horizontal anisotropy on stream depletion the values of t α t β and θ were varied a greater horizontal anisotropy ratio of t α t β is predicted to lead to a higher stream depletion rate fig 8 a when t α t β equals to 50 the depletion rate under pseudo steady state conditions is about 48 m3 day whereas this depletion rate is 45 m3 day when tα tβ is 5 although the stream depletion rate does not show large differences under three scenarios described in fig 8a the total stream depletion amounts are significantly different for such three scenarios for example when the stream depletion rate reaches steady state the difference of the total depletion amounts during a 30 day pumping period for t α t β 50 and t α t β 5 is 90 m3 therefore one can conclude that horizontal anisotropy ratio has moderate impact on stream depletion amount for the example shown in fig 8 a in addition as shown in fig 8 b when θ varies from 0 to 90 the depletion rate decreases considerably the difference of stream depletion rate between 0 and 90 reaches to 7 m3 day which suggests that stream depletion rates are sensitive to the principal transmissivity direction 5 4 discussion the derived drawdown equation and related parameter estimation procedures are based on a series of assumptions which may limit the usage of this approach several future studies can be carried out on the basis of this work with the purpose of expanding the current knowledge for investigating horizontally anisotropic aquifers firstly in this work the stream is simplified into a straight line and without considering its width future work can take the stream width into account for instance one can make use of the study by zlotnik et al 1999 who derived an analytical solution for stream depletion with a finite stream width in an isotropic aquifer secondly streams may only partially penetrate the aquifer such as streams in the great plains zlotnik and huang 1999 the application of this study to a partially penetrating stream will result in the overestimation of stream depletion rate chen and yin 2004 therefore future work could also incorporate this factor into consideration zlotnik and tartakovsky 2008 baalousha 2012 additionally hydraulic disconnection between the stream and the groundwater and semi permeable barrier between the streambed and surrounding aquifer are possible in actual applications and should be accommodated in future studies darama 2001 singh 2003 brunner et al 2011 6 conclusions drawdown in observation wells are predicted to be substantially different for a horizontally anisotropic confined aquifer compared to horizontally isotropic based on the newly derived equations the direction of principal transmissivity and anisotropic ratio within a horizontally anisotropic aquifer laterally bounded by a stream considerably impact the distribution of drawdown in space and time and stream depletion rates a straightforward inverse analytical method is developed to estimate aquifer properties based on drawdown time curves collected at minimum three non collinear observation wells this method is easy to use and can determine four parameters of a horizontally anisotropic confined aquifer simultaneously including two principal transmissivity values storativity and the direction of the major principal transmissivity the analytical inversion method proposed in this study is compared with a four parameter numerical inversion scheme in a matlab script file programed by the authors although similar inversion results are obtained the matlab program may become problematic for separating the local minima from the global minima if the initial guess values and or the variational ranges of parameters are not properly chosen the analytical inversion method proposed in this study however appears to be robust and reliable for aquifer parameter estimations the analytical inverse method of this study is applied to interpret a synthetic pumping test data set and the predicted values are acceptable in the range of allowable errors

7427,better understanding of the dynamics of hydrological connectivity between river and floodplain is essential for the ecological integrity of river systems in this study we proposed a regime switch modelling rsm framework which integrates change point analysis with dynamic linear regression to detect and date change points in linear regression and to quantify the relative importance of natural variations and anthropogenic disturbances the approach was applied to the long term hydrological time series to investigate the evolution of river floodplain relation in dongting lake in the last five decades during which the yangtze river system experienced unprecedented anthropogenic manipulations our results suggested that 1 there were five distinct regimes during which the influence of inflows and local climate on lake water level changed significantly the detected change points were well corresponding to the major events occurred upon the yangtze 2 although the importance of inflows from the yangtze was greater than that of the tributaries flows over the five regimes the relative contribution gradually decreased from regime 1 to regime 5 the weakening of hydrological forcing from the yangtze was mainly attributed to the reduction in channel capacity resulting from sedimentation in the outfalls and water level dropping caused by river bed scour in the mainstream 3 the effects of local climate was much smaller than these of inflows and 4 since the operation of the three gorges dam in 2006 the river floodplain relationship entered a new equilibrium in that all investigated variables changed synchronously in terms of direction and magnitude the results from this study reveal the mechanisms underlying the alternated inundation regime in dongting lake the identified change points some of which have not been previously reported will allow a reappraisal of the current dam and reservoir operation strategies not only for flood drought risk management but also for the maintenance and restoration of the regional ecological integrity keywords regime switching model dynamic multiple linear regression three gorges dam dongting lake regime shift 1 introduction floodplains are among the most productive ecosystems on the globe providing fundamental ecological functions and services such as flood mitigation food production recreation and biodiversity sustenance to support human wellbeing and cultural values dudgeon et al 2006 acreman and ferguson 2010 however the world s large river systems and their associated littoral ecosystems are under increasing pressure from economic development sarukhán and whyte 2005 such as dam construction levee creation channel modification and water extraction nilsson et al 2005 graf 2006 tockner et al 2010 cochrane et al 2014 wen and saintilan 2014 furthermore there is currently a boom in hydropower development expected to further reduce the number of remaining free flowing large rivers by about 21 zarfl et al 2015 these alterations can induce substantial costs to human societies and severe ecological consequences lehner et al 2011 and floodplains are among the most threatened ecosystems tockner et al 2010 the ecosystem services delivered by floodplain ecosystems are inextricably linked to inundation regimes also referred to as hydroperiod including the extent duration and timing of floods which is primarily driven by the flow regimes of the associated rivers opperman et al 2009 engineering works kiss et al 2008 as well as runoff from local catchments the acknowledgement of the central role of hydrology in maintaining the ecological integrity of floodplains has led to global efforts to enhance the hydrological connectivity of river floodplain systems pringle 2001 poff and zimmerman 2010 most recently ecosystem based management such as floodplain reconnection e g levee breach dam removal returning cultivated lands to wetlands jenkins et al 2010 and environmental flow acreman and dunbar 2004 which integrate the flood mitigation and ecological restoration emerged as a green approach opperman et al 2009 advancing our understanding of the dynamics of hydrological connectivity between river and floodplain is essential for the success of these approaches whited et al 2007 the floodplain inundation varies over time in response to three fundamental mechanisms 1 land use change at both regional and local scales o connell et al 2007 2 climate change palmer et al 2008 and 3 engineering structures along rivers themselves pinter and heine 2005 wen 2009 and within the floodplain wen et al 2013 or any combination thereof whited et al 2007 investigation and prediction of inundation regime is traditionally aided by inundation modelling using a combination of flow frequency analysis and hydrodynamic modelling paz et al 2009 wen et al 2013 however methods for floodplain hydrodynamic models typically rely on an assumption of stationary hydraulic conditions galloway 2011 for example the network of linkages between floodplains and river channels is generally constrained within a fitted setting of bathymetric variables dhi 2007 also the water movement within the floodplain is modelled using a fixed set of geomorphic parameters nevertheless river channels and floodplains are inherently dynamic and continually adjust their geometries and gradients in response to changes in flow and sediment fluxes pinter and heine 2005 because such changes alter the river floodplain coupling and water movements in floodplain therefore change the temporal inundation patterns and distribution of waterbodies in floodplain however the integration of morphodynamic and hydrodynamic models is currently limited due to our incomplete knowledge of system thresholds and feedback mechanisms lotsari et al 2015 statistical analysis of long term trend and change points in hydrological gauge records can reveal the underlying generating mechanisms of system changes villarini et al 2013 and therefore has the potential to improve our understanding of the dynamic nature of the river floodplain relationship this knowledge can greatly improve our capacity to detect synchronous or followed abiotic and biotic tipping point of wetland ecosystems change point techniques have been developed to detect abrupt shifts in the parameters i e mean and variance of a time

2625 km2 and poyang lake 2933 km2 are the two most predominant ecosystems with free connections with the yangtze mainstream sun et al 2012 lai et al 2014 the floodplains have experienced many changes

regimes yuan et al 2015 since the operation of tgd many studies have shown that the inundation regimes and the distribution patterns of wetland habitats in dongting lake and poyang lake changed

guo et al 2012 han et al 2016 the changes in inundation regimes have detrimental impacts on its ecological functions as habitats for fish turvey et al 2010 and migratory birds wang et al 2013 guan et al 2014 although these changes were presumably linked to tgd climate is a confounding factor for example the four recent severe droughts in dongting lake i e 2000 2002 2005 and 2006 could be associated with the construction and operation of tgd yuan et al 2015 quantifying the relative contributions of river regulation and regional climate fluctuations on inundation regimes has not been well explored partly due to the highly dynamic nature of river lake relationship dai and liu 2013 ye et al 2013 this uncertainty triggered an ongoing debate about how to operate the tgd and upstream cascade dams for maintaining the downstream biodiversity hotspots such as dongting lake and poyang lake in this study we developed regime switch model rsm by integrating change point analysis with dynamic multiple linear regression rsm was then applied to the long term hydrological and climatic records 1961 2014 in dongting lake to explore the evolution of river floodplain relationship our primary aim is to explore possible mechanisms behind the observed inundation pattern changes in dongting lake specifically we embed the following questions into rsm framework 1 are there any detectable trends in the time series of lake water level 2 are there any abrupt changes regime shifts in the detected trends 3 when and how did the regime shifts occur and 4 what the relative contributions of anthropogenic modification and climatic variability to the regime shifts 2 methods 2 1 dongting lake and its hydrological foundation dongting lake approximately 28 30 n 30 20 n 111 40 e 113 10 e the second largest freshwater lake in china is situated in the south bank of the middle reach of yangtze river approximately 400 km downstream of tgd fig 1 it not only plays a vital role in flood control and climate regulation in the middle and lower reach of yangtze river basin yin et al 2007 but also provides diverse and abundant habitats for flora and fauna at local regional national and global scales due to its various wetland types such as alluvial forests meadows shadow waters and mudflats guan et al 2016 the lake has a subtropical monsoon climate with a distinct high low water seasons the annual water level variation is 12 7 1 8 m based on the daily water level records at chenglingji during 1961 2014 under normal conditions summer july september is prevalently high water season and winter december to next february is low water season during high water seasons the floodplain is an extensive surface water retained by levees and banks during low water seasons an array of sub lakes intermingling with mudflats and grasslands emerge as water level withdraws dongting lake was once the largest fresh water lake in china with a surface area of 6300 km2 in 1825 yin et al 2007 however the present lake surface area is approximately 40 2500 km2 of its maximum size as a result of land reclamation and accelerated sediment load zhao et al 2005 dongting lake has three main water sources flows from the yangtze through the three outfalls songzi river hudu river and ouchi river collectively referred as the three outfalls in fig 1 inflows from four major tributaries xiangjiang river zijiang river yuanjiang river and lishui river referred as the four tributaries and local rainfall and runoff the lake discharges into the yangtze through the only outlet channel located at northeast corner and the flow is gauged at chenglingji fig 1 2 2 data preparation daily river flows of the four tributaries and three outfalls were obtained from bureau of hydrology the yangtze river water resources commission daily climate data rainfall and temperature at yueyang were sourced from china meteological data service center cmdc china meteorological administration to simplify data analysis we summed up the flow time series that measure the inflows from yangtze thereafter referred as inflow1 and the flows at four main tributaries thereafter referred as inflow 2 to enable the comparison between sites and periods we adopted the standardised flow index sfi proposed by wen et al 2011 and computed the 3 month sfi for all flow time series this transformation of flow data is also necessary as it could reduce the collinearity issue for regression wen 2009 with the historical climate records we calculated the 3 month standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 the 3 month spei was used in the structural time series to account for the efforts of local rainfall and evaporation on water level fluctuation we chose the timeframe of three months as the 3 month indices reflect short and medium term conditions and provide a seasonal estimation of hydrological and climatic patterns 2 3 data analysis 2 3 1 seasonal trend the non parametric seasonal mann kendall test smk test hirsch et al 1982 hipel and mcleod 1994 was used to detect the seasonal as well as overall trends in the time series the smk test is a multivariate extension of the mann kendall statics which is commonly employed to detect monotonic trends in series of environmental climatic and hydrological data hipel and mcleod 1994 for a time series x consisting a completed records measured over n years with m seasons the mann kendall statistic for the gth season is calculated as hirsch et al 1982 1 s g i 1 n 1 j i 1 n sgn x jg x ig g 1 2 m where sgn is 1 if xjg xig 0 and 1 if xjg xig 0 and xig are the records of x for the gth season at year i and j respectively and for the entire time series stotal is the sum of sg to account for the serial correlation in the monthly data we computed the seasonal variance covariance matrix according to libiseller and grimvall 2002 and adjusted the z statistics for the entire series 2 3 2 modelling lake water level and river flow relationship to better understand water level dynamics and its drivers we developed dynamic multiple linear regression models with water level index at chenglingji as the dependent variable and three predictor variables i e spei inflow1 and inflow2 as shown in eq 2 one of the key objectives was to take advantage of each time step of the sfi time series and to model water level fluctuation continuously through periods of high low water we achieved this by including the previous water level index as an additional predictor variable into the model equation models in which a time lagged dependent variable is used as an additional predictor variable are referred to as dynamic linear regression models and are commonly used for the analysis and forecasting of time series data in economics mcleod et al 2011 the lagged dependent variable introduces a temporal component into the model so that the sfi at a given time step is also a function of the sfi of the previous time step in the time series 2 y t α y t 1 β x t ε t t 1 2 3 n where at time t yt is the water level index y t 1 is the water level index at the previous time step month in our study xt is a vector of the regressors including intercept the flow index for inflow1 and inflow2 and spei β is the coefficients vector and ε t is the white noise i i d 0 σ2 we use moving sums mosum of the residuals which is from the generalized fluctuation test framework kuan and hornik 1995 to test the null hypothesis that the regression coefficient vector of the linear regression β are constant over time against an alternative hypothesis that the coefficients change over time due to the variation in extraneous factors both mosum and cumulative sum cusum tests are applied to detect temporal structural changes in the areas such as econometrics ghosh 2009 climatology reeves et al 2007 hydrology webb et al 2012 and environment science devries et al 2015 the mosum is defined for each time point t as follows 3 mosum t 1 σ s t w 1 t ε t t w n ε t y t x t β t 1 1 x t s 1 t x s x s x t σ 2 1 n w t w 1 n ε t ε t 2 where n is the length of the time series y t i e total number of data samples w is the moving window size determining by the bandwidth h which defined as a fraction of the number of observations in the sample β t 1 is the ordinary least squares ols estimate of regression coefficients of eq 2 based on the observations up to t 1 and ε t and σ 2 are the corresponding residues and variance estimated on the history period we used the strucchange package zeileis et al 2002 with the r software environment r core team 2014 for detecting and dating the unknown break points of the model 2 the foundation for estimating change point for regression model was developed by bai 1994 and was extended to multiple change points detection by bai 1997 and bai and perron 1998 the sequential procedures can be summarized into two steps as follows 1 the first step checks for existence of structural change based on the assumption that variability of the mosum is structural stability therefore follows a brownian motion i e random walk with an expected mean of zero in other words if the time series is stable all residuals and hence their mosum values should fluctuate closely around zero if the mosum crosses the 95 confidence boundary which follows the functional central limit theorem leisch et al 2000 then structural change is detected 2 the second step determines the number and location of change points when structural change is detected in the first step the sample is split in two and the testing then starts in the two segments this recursive process continues until no more break point is detected the maximum number of change breaks is related to the bandwidth h and we used h 0 15 to allow for a maximum of 6 break points in this study the optimal number of change points is determined by minimizing the bayesian information criterion bic and the residual sum of squares rss with m change points detected the regression model 2 was fitted to m 1 segments or regimes and the m 1 vectors of coefficient are estimated 4 y t α j yj t 1 β j x j ε t t t j 1 1 t j j 1 m 1 we referred the piecewise regression in eq 4 as regime switching model rsm piecewise linear models as a special case of non linear regression are often used as approximations to complex phenomena to extract basic features of the data zeileis et al 2003 we also ran one way anova to compare model 2 and model 4 in addition as all the variables are standardized their relative contribution to lake water level at each regime is directly comparable 3 results 3 1 trends in hydrological and climatic variables and their seasonality the river flow at zhicheng the station at yangtze immediately upstream the three outfalls flowing to dongting lake had no trend for the entire time series p 0 564 however the correlated seasonal mann kendall test indicated that there was a significant increasing trend in jan feb and mar and a significant decreasing trend in sep oct and nov table 1 the total inflows from yangtze delivered by the three outfalls showed a significantly decreasing trend for each month and the decrease was significant for the entire time series table 1 the inflows from the four major tributary rivers had no trends for all months except mar in which increase trend was significant p 0 031 for spei at dongting region the correlated seasonal mann kendall testing results suggested no trends for every month except september p 0 043 and an overall increasing trend was detected p 0 045 table 1 the water level at chenglingji had a significantly positive trend for jan feb and mar and significantly negative trend for oct table 1 overall the trend was positive however for discharge the negative trend for the period of july to december was significant in addition only mar showed a significantly positive trend these trend analyses revealed little about the river lake relationships 3 2 breakpoints and regimes in river lake relationship the mosum process indicated that there were several occasions when the mosum crossed the 95 boundaries fig 2 a this visual observation of the existence of breakpoints was confirmed by statistical test m0 3 77 p 0 01 the bic suggested that models with three and four change points were equally supported by the data fig 2b because the δbic was 2 for the two bic was 908 58 and 910 78 for the three and four change points models respectively anderson and burnham 1998 however we presented and reported the model with four break points as it had lower rss residual sum of squares than the model with three break points fig 2b the four identified breakpoints corresponded to five regimes during the period of 1961 2014 mar 1961 jun 1972 jul 1972 jun 1980 jul 1980 dec 1997 jan 2000 aug 2006 and sep 2006 dec 2014 table 2 3 3 trends for individual regimes we divided the entire time series into five segments according to the identified regimes and performed correlated seasonal mann kendall test for each of them table 3 the lake water level decreased till regime 5 after which it increased significantly however the decline was significant at 5 level only for regime 1 similarly the discharge from dongting lake also decreased for the first four regimes the decrease was significant for regimes 1 and 2 and increased significantly during regime 5 for flows from the three outlets inflow1 significant decrease was detected till regime 5 after which it showed an increasing trend albeit not significant at 5 level inflows from the four tributaries inflow2 decreased significantly for regime 2 and 3 but did not change significantly for other regimes for river flows in yangtze river at zhicheng it decreased significantly during regimes 1 and changes in other regimes was not significantly at 5 level as with the test using entire time series the changes in spei was not significant during any regime 3 4 the evolution of the river lake relationship the regime switching model had much higher adjusted r2 the adjusted r2 93 65 and 83 96 for regime switching and standard models respectively the anova confirmed the superior performance of the regime switching model over the standard one df 20 f 26 79 p 0 001 furthermore the residuals of the regime shift model the variations in water level index which were not accounted for had no trend according to the csmk test p 0 656 for overall and ranged 0 365 to 0 976 for every month while there was still a significant trend in the residuals of the standard model overall p 0 001 fig 3 visualized the fitted regime switching model the two models were undistinguishable for normal hydrological conditions i e sfi between 1 and 1 however the regime switching model fitted the extreme values i e floods and droughts better than the standard model did in most cases fig 3 the first regime 1961 1972 was dominated by hydrological droughts during which several severe droughts i e 1963 1967 1969 and 1972 fig 3 occurred in the dongting region including the longest drought sep 1971 oct 1972 for the entire study period fig 3 normal conditions prevailed the second 1972 1980 and the third 1981 1997 regimes as majority of the sfi was within the 1 5 thresholds although there were some brief droughts and floods for example the flood in the 1982 83 winter fig 3 the fourth regime 1998 2006 was predominated by wet conditions and several floods including the most damaging one i e 1998 in recent history zong and chen 2000 dry condition prevailed the fifth regime 2006 2014 with four severe droughts recorded i e 2006 2009 2011 and 2013 fig 3 in addition the severest drought during the study period fell in this regime i e 2006 fig 3 the river lake relationship could be interpreted from fitted coefficients of the regression models table 4 as all predictor variables are standardized their contributions to the water level fluctuations in dongting lake could be directly compared based on the fitted coefficients generally local climatic conditions characterized by spei had the least contribution to water level variation moreover the effects of spei on water level variations was not significant for regimes 2 and 4 note that the relative importance of the local spei was substantially higher and was comparable to that of the inflow 2 indicated by the standard regression model table 4 in comparison with the inflows from the four tributaries inflows from the yangtze always had higher influence on the water level fluctuations at dongting as the coefficient of inflow 1 was larger than that of the inflow 2 for all regimes table 4 however the relative importance of the inflow from the yangtze river to water level variability in dongting decreased gradually from regime 1 to regime 5 but regime 2 during which the contributions of two inflows were comparable coefficient for inflows 1 and 2 were 0 385 and 0 362 respectively table 4 4 discussion during the study period the dongting lake has experienced unprecedented anthropogenic changes including hydrological regulations and land reclamation yin et al 2007 these changes have fundamental impacts on the river floodplain relationship resulting in rapid alternation in hydrological and sediment regimes yin et al 2007 ou et al 2012 with significant hydrodynamic and morphodynamic consequences in the associated floodplains lauer and parker 2008 marchetti et al 2016 ultimately these changes would lead to imminent and disastrous loss in ecosystem services at local and regional scale costanza et al 2014 guan et al 2016 to ensure the long term ecological security soft e g adjusting dam operation to partially reinstall flow regimes and hard e g construction of low level levees to retain flow for longer time engineering solutions are increasingly being used in an attempt to reverse these historical impacts of flow regulations wang et al 2006 however better understanding of the dynamic river floodplain coupling is urgently required to minimize the potential risks associated with these restoration efforts in this study we first confirmed the existence of seasonal trends in the standardized climatic and river flow time series using correlated seasonal mann kendall test we then used regime switch dynamic linear regression rsm to model water level fluctuations through cycles of flooding and drying as a function of key inflows and climatic drivers the empirical rsm framework allowed us to investigate the evolution of river floodplain relationship and relative contribution of different water sources to lake water level variation our results indicated that there were five regimes over the last five decades during which the effects of inflows and local climate condition on the lake water level changed significantly fig 3 although the importance of yangtze inflows was greater than that of the tributaries flows over the five regimes table 4 it gradually decreased from regime 1 to regime 5 note that the long term average contributions in term of total volume is 37 1 and 54 6 for the three outfalls and the four tributaries respectively yin et al 2007 the disproportional importance of flows from the three outfalls may be attributed to the higher inter annual flow variations table 1 in addition the effect of local climate was much smaller than these of inflows and it was not significant at regimes 2 and 4 at 5 level finally we investigated the trends in hydrological variables for each regime using the same csmk test the identified trends including the direction and degree of change provided new insights to the evolution of river floodplain relationship which were well corresponding to the natural variations and anthropogenic modifications these details could not be revealed by trend or change point analysis using the entire time series 4 1 regime 1 jan 1961 jun 1972 this period coincided with the rapid land reclamation in the middle yangtze region yin et al 2007 during which about 1000 km2 of lake area was converted into cropland du et al 2011 the decrease in surface water area should have caused an upward tendency in lake water level and discharge however both discharge and lake water level decreased significantly during this period suggesting other factors played predominant roles in regulating lake water balance of the variables investigated in the study local climate and inflows from the four tributaries had no significant trend during this period and only inflows from the yangtze via the three outfalls showed significant decrease which was coincident with the significant decline in yangtze river flows table 3 the disagreement between inflows from the four tributaries and river flows in the yangtze at zhicheng thereby inflows via the three outfalls suggested that the prevailing climate in the upstream catchment may not always be synchronous with that at middle catchment moreover mann kendall s score suggested that the decrease in inflows via the three outfalls was greater than that of the river flows in the yangtze this might be caused by the blockage of tiaoxiankou in 1958 which used to be the fourth outfall also the meander cut off of jingjiang river reach during 1967 to 1972 resulted in river bed scour and the stream water level dropping in the river segment of the yangtze where the three outfalls were located ou et al 2012 wang et al 2017 the prevailing role of flows from the three outfalls in controlling the water balance in dongting lake was also confirmed by the estimated coefficient of the regime switching model 4 2 regime 2 jul 1973 jun 1980 the water level in dongting lake continued to decline although the trend was not significant nevertheless water discharge from the lake decreased significantly during this period lake reclamation continued but at a much lower rate du et al 2011 however both inflows from the yangtze via the three outfalls and the four tributaries decreased significantly and the effects of the two inflows on lake water level were comparable in contrast to significant decreasing trend in inflows to the lake river flows in the yangtze mainstream was relatively stable although decreased slightly the disproportional decrease in inflows via the three outfalls indicated that river bed building up was unalleviated and the channel capacity continued to shrink yin et al 2007 wang et al 2017 gezhouba gzb the first large dam on the yangtze initiated in the end of 1970 and started dam closing in march 1980 likely played a role in driving the regime shift in april 1980 4 3 regime 3 jul 1980 dec 1997 despite the significant decline in flows from both inflows both discharge and lake water level had no significant trend at 5 level albeit the trends were generally negative although the river flow in yangtze river as measured at zhicheng remained relatively stable during this period the inflows via the three outfalls continuously declined significantly an indication of the continuity of channel capacity shrinkage with water level dropping in the main stream of yangtze caused by river bed scour downstream gzb tang et al 2001 moreover the effects of flow via the three outfalls regained dominance for regulating lake water level the change point in 1997 has not previously been reported hydrologic alteration happened in different phases of dam construction it may start at river close e g partial regulation before final dam closure and complete regulation grams et al 2007 as first phase of tgd construction river closing occurred in november 1997 and may have triggered this regime shift 4 4 regime 4 jan 1998 aug 2006 as with regime 3 both discharge and lake water level had no significant trend at 5 level albeit the trends were generally negative the closure of tgd and impounding of tgd reservoir occurred in this regime ou et al 2012 these led to the significant decrease in yangtze river flows downstream of the tgd which was confirmed by the csmk test table 3 also sun et al 2012 yu et al 2013 however the decrease river flows in the yangtze was only partly responsible for the significant decreasing trend in flows via the three outfalls which showed a much sharper decreasing tendency the disproportional large decline in flow through the three outfalls for the first four regimes indicated the persistence of channel capacity shrinkage caused by siltation du et al 2001 in a study of the water and sediments balance in dongting lake chen 2016 also found a shift in 1998 which was in the 95 confident level bracket of the identified change point in our study i e feb 1997 to dec 1998 table 2 similarly han et al 2016 tested the year of 1999 as changing point using flow records at yichang a gauging station downstream of tgd and 59 km upstream zhicheng spei and the inflows from the four tributaries showed no significant trend in this regime the discrepancy between the trends in lake water level and inflows from the three outfalls might indicate the hydrological forcing of the yangtze started to weaken after more than four decades of continuous decline in flows 4 5 regime 5 sep 2006 dec 2014 this was the only regime when all investigated time series showed significantly positive trends at 10 level only water level had significantly increasing trend at 5 level moreover the direction and degree of change in yangtze flow at zhicheng and inflow via the three outfalls was similar for the first time the impounding and full operation of three gorges reservoir in sep 2006 was possibly the main anthropogenic factor responsible for this regime change sediment dynamics in dongting lake changed from siltation to erosion in 2006 hu et al 2015 chen 2016 the operation of tgd has dramatically reduced downstream sedimentation and siltation du et al 2011 particularly in dongting sun et al 2012 the reduction in sediment concentration in river flow might have slowed down or even reversed channel bed build up goldschneider et al 2007 resulting a relative stable river flow discharge relationship the synchronized dynamics of lake and river hydrology might mark the start of new stabilized river lake relationships after the operation of tgd and should be closely monitored 5 conclusion in summary we proposed a two step regime switch modelling rsm framework to detect and quantify regime shifts in dynamic multiple linear regression first mosum process was used to detect and date change points in dynamic multiple linear regression the entire time series was then segmented into regimes according to the dates of identified change points and a piecewise dynamic multiple linear regression was fitted to quantify the coefficients for each regime we applied this approach to the long term water level time series 1961 2014 in dongting lake exploring the dynamics of river floodplain relationship the resulted regime shifts were retrospectively traceable to the major events occurred upon the yangtze river such as the impounding of three gorges reservoir and full operation of the tgd demonstrating the practicality of rsm in this case study anthropogenic manipulations particularly river regulation and dams were supposed to be the main drivers weakening connectivity between yangtze river and its floodplain the change points in 1997 and 2006 first revealed by our study provided new references for tipping point study on ecological regime shift synchronous to hydrologic alteration especially water birds inhabiting in the middle yangtze

7427,better understanding of the dynamics of hydrological connectivity between river and floodplain is essential for the ecological integrity of river systems in this study we proposed a regime switch modelling rsm framework which integrates change point analysis with dynamic linear regression to detect and date change points in linear regression and to quantify the relative importance of natural variations and anthropogenic disturbances the approach was applied to the long term hydrological time series to investigate the evolution of river floodplain relation in dongting lake in the last five decades during which the yangtze river system experienced unprecedented anthropogenic manipulations our results suggested that 1 there were five distinct regimes during which the influence of inflows and local climate on lake water level changed significantly the detected change points were well corresponding to the major events occurred upon the yangtze 2 although the importance of inflows from the yangtze was greater than that of the tributaries flows over the five regimes the relative contribution gradually decreased from regime 1 to regime 5 the weakening of hydrological forcing from the yangtze was mainly attributed to the reduction in channel capacity resulting from sedimentation in the outfalls and water level dropping caused by river bed scour in the mainstream 3 the effects of local climate was much smaller than these of inflows and 4 since the operation of the three gorges dam in 2006 the river floodplain relationship entered a new equilibrium in that all investigated variables changed synchronously in terms of direction and magnitude the results from this study reveal the mechanisms underlying the alternated inundation regime in dongting lake the identified change points some of which have not been previously reported will allow a reappraisal of the current dam and reservoir operation strategies not only for flood drought risk management but also for the maintenance and restoration of the regional ecological integrity keywords regime switching model dynamic multiple linear regression three gorges dam dongting lake regime shift 1 introduction floodplains are among the most productive ecosystems on the globe providing fundamental ecological functions and services such as flood mitigation food production recreation and biodiversity sustenance to support human wellbeing and cultural values dudgeon et al 2006 acreman and ferguson 2010 however the world s large river systems and their associated littoral ecosystems are under increasing pressure from economic development sarukhán and whyte 2005 such as dam construction levee creation channel modification and water extraction nilsson et al 2005 graf 2006 tockner et al 2010 cochrane et al 2014 wen and saintilan 2014 furthermore there is currently a boom in hydropower development expected to further reduce the number of remaining free flowing large rivers by about 21 zarfl et al 2015 these alterations can induce substantial costs to human societies and severe ecological consequences lehner et al 2011 and floodplains are among the most threatened ecosystems tockner et al 2010 the ecosystem services delivered by floodplain ecosystems are inextricably linked to inundation regimes also referred to as hydroperiod including the extent duration and timing of floods which is primarily driven by the flow regimes of the associated rivers opperman et al 2009 engineering works kiss et al 2008 as well as runoff from local catchments the acknowledgement of the central role of hydrology in maintaining the ecological integrity of floodplains has led to global efforts to enhance the hydrological connectivity of river floodplain systems pringle 2001 poff and zimmerman 2010 most recently ecosystem based management such as floodplain reconnection e g levee breach dam removal returning cultivated lands to wetlands jenkins et al 2010 and environmental flow acreman and dunbar 2004 which integrate the flood mitigation and ecological restoration emerged as a green approach opperman et al 2009 advancing our understanding of the dynamics of hydrological connectivity between river and floodplain is essential for the success of these approaches whited et al 2007 the floodplain inundation varies over time in response to three fundamental mechanisms 1 land use change at both regional and local scales o connell et al 2007 2 climate change palmer et al 2008 and 3 engineering structures along rivers themselves pinter and heine 2005 wen 2009 and within the floodplain wen et al 2013 or any combination thereof whited et al 2007 investigation and prediction of inundation regime is traditionally aided by inundation modelling using a combination of flow frequency analysis and hydrodynamic modelling paz et al 2009 wen et al 2013 however methods for floodplain hydrodynamic models typically rely on an assumption of stationary hydraulic conditions galloway 2011 for example the network of linkages between floodplains and river channels is generally constrained within a fitted setting of bathymetric variables dhi 2007 also the water movement within the floodplain is modelled using a fixed set of geomorphic parameters nevertheless river channels and floodplains are inherently dynamic and continually adjust their geometries and gradients in response to changes in flow and sediment fluxes pinter and heine 2005 because such changes alter the river floodplain coupling and water movements in floodplain therefore change the temporal inundation patterns and distribution of waterbodies in floodplain however the integration of morphodynamic and hydrodynamic models is currently limited due to our incomplete knowledge of system thresholds and feedback mechanisms lotsari et al 2015 statistical analysis of long term trend and change points in hydrological gauge records can reveal the underlying generating mechanisms of system changes villarini et al 2013 and therefore has the potential to improve our understanding of the dynamic nature of the river floodplain relationship this knowledge can greatly improve our capacity to detect synchronous or followed abiotic and biotic tipping point of wetland ecosystems change point techniques have been developed to detect abrupt shifts in the parameters i e mean and variance of a time series or in the coefficients of a regression model and have widespread applications in hydrology meteorology economics finance and telecommunications chen and gupta 2011 details of change point analysis techniques and their application can be found in perron 2006 and beaulieu et al 2012 the middle yangtze river system supports extensive floodplains and lakes among which dongting lake over 2625 km2 and poyang lake 2933 km2 are the two most predominant ecosystems with free connections with the yangtze mainstream sun et al 2012 lai et al 2014 the floodplains have experienced many changes

regimes yuan et al 2015 since the operation of tgd many studies have shown that the inundation regimes and the distribution patterns of wetland habitats in dongting lake and poyang lake changed

al 2014 although these changes were presumably linked to tgd climate is a confounding factor for example the four recent severe droughts in dongting lake i e 2000 2002 2005 and 2006 could be associated with the construction and operation of tgd yuan et al 2015 quantifying the relative contributions of river regulation and regional climate fluctuations on inundation regimes has not been well explored partly due to the highly dynamic nature of river lake relationship dai and liu 2013 ye et al 2013 this uncertainty triggered an ongoing debate about how to operate the tgd and upstream cascade dams for maintaining the downstream biodiversity hotspots such as dongting lake and poyang lake in this study we developed regime switch model rsm by integrating change point analysis with dynamic multiple linear regression rsm was then applied to the long term hydrological and climatic records 1961 2014 in dongting lake to explore the evolution of river floodplain relationship our primary aim is to explore possible mechanisms behind the observed inundation pattern changes in dongting lake specifically we embed the following questions into rsm framework 1 are there any detectable trends in the time series of lake water level 2 are there any abrupt changes regime shifts in the detected trends 3 when and how did the regime shifts occur and 4 what the relative contributions of anthropogenic modification and climatic variability to the regime shifts 2 methods 2 1 dongting lake and its hydrological foundation dongting lake approximately 28 30 n 30 20 n 111 40 e 113 10 e the second largest freshwater lake in china is situated in the south bank of the middle reach of yangtze river approximately 400 km downstream of tgd fig 1 it not only plays a vital role in flood control and climate regulation in the middle and lower reach of yangtze river basin yin et al 2007 but also provides diverse and abundant habitats for flora and fauna at local regional national and global scales due to its various wetland types such as alluvial forests meadows shadow waters and mudflats guan et al 2016 the lake has a subtropical monsoon climate with a distinct high low water seasons the annual water level variation is 12 7 1 8 m based on the daily water level records at chenglingji during 1961 2014 under normal conditions summer july september is prevalently high water season and winter december to next february is low water season during high water seasons the floodplain is an extensive surface water retained by levees and banks during low water seasons an array of sub lakes intermingling with mudflats and grasslands emerge as water level withdraws dongting lake was once the largest fresh water lake in china with a surface area of 6300 km2 in 1825 yin et al 2007 however the present lake surface area is approximately 40 2500 km2 of its maximum size as a result of land reclamation and accelerated sediment load zhao et al 2005 dongting lake has three main water sources flows from the yangtze through the three outfalls songzi river hudu river and ouchi river collectively referred as the three outfalls in fig 1 inflows from four major tributaries xiangjiang river zijiang river yuanjiang river and lishui river referred as the four tributaries and local rainfall and runoff the lake discharges into the yangtze through the only outlet channel located at northeast corner and the flow is gauged at chenglingji fig 1 2 2 data preparation daily river flows of the four tributaries and three outfalls were obtained from bureau of hydrology the yangtze river water resources commission daily climate data rainfall and temperature at yueyang were sourced from china meteological data service center cmdc china meteorological administration to simplify data analysis we summed up the flow time series that measure the inflows from yangtze thereafter referred as inflow1 and the flows at four main tributaries thereafter referred as inflow 2 to enable the comparison between sites and periods we adopted the standardised flow index sfi proposed by wen et al 2011 and computed the 3 month sfi for all flow time series this transformation of flow data is also necessary as it could reduce the collinearity issue for regression wen 2009 with the historical climate records we calculated the 3 month standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 the 3 month spei was used in the structural time series to account for the efforts of local rainfall and evaporation on water level fluctuation we chose the timeframe of three months as the 3 month indices reflect short and medium term conditions and provide a seasonal estimation of hydrological and climatic patterns 2 3 data analysis 2 3 1 seasonal trend the non parametric seasonal mann kendall test smk test hirsch et al 1982 hipel and mcleod 1994 was used to detect the seasonal as well as overall trends in the time series the smk test is a multivariate extension of the mann kendall statics which is commonly employed to detect monotonic trends in series of environmental climatic and hydrological data hipel and mcleod 1994 for a time series x consisting a completed records measured over n years with m seasons the mann kendall statistic for the gth season is calculated as hirsch et al 1982 1 s g i 1 n 1 j i 1 n sgn x jg x ig g 1 2 m where sgn is 1 if xjg xig 0 and 1 if xjg xig 0 and xig are the records of x for the gth season at year i and j respectively and for the entire time series stotal is the sum of sg to account for the serial correlation in the monthly data we computed the seasonal variance covariance matrix according to libiseller and grimvall 2002 and adjusted the z statistics for the entire series 2 3 2 modelling lake water level and river flow relationship to better understand water level dynamics and its drivers we developed dynamic multiple linear regression models with water level index at chenglingji as the dependent variable and three predictor variables i e spei inflow1 and inflow2 as shown in eq 2 one of the key objectives was to take advantage of each time step of the sfi time series and to model water level fluctuation continuously through periods of high low water we achieved this by including the previous water level index as an additional predictor variable into the model equation models in which a time lagged dependent variable is used as an additional predictor variable are referred to as dynamic linear regression models and are commonly used for the analysis and forecasting of time series data in economics mcleod et al 2011 the lagged dependent variable introduces a temporal component into the model so that the sfi at a given time step is also a function of the sfi of the previous time step in the time series 2 y t α y t 1 β x t ε t t 1 2 3 n where at time t yt is the water level index y t 1 is the water level index at the previous time step month in our study xt is a vector of the regressors including intercept the flow index for inflow1 and inflow2 and spei β is the coefficients vector and ε t is the white noise i i d 0 σ2 we use moving sums mosum of the residuals which is from the generalized fluctuation test framework kuan and hornik 1995 to test the null hypothesis that the regression coefficient vector of the linear regression β are constant over time against an alternative hypothesis that the coefficients change over time due to the variation in extraneous factors both mosum and cumulative sum cusum tests are applied to detect temporal structural changes in the areas such as econometrics ghosh 2009 climatology reeves et al 2007 hydrology webb et al 2012 and environment science devries et al 2015 the mosum is defined for each time point t as follows 3 mosum t 1 σ s t w 1 t ε t t w n ε t y t x t β t 1 1 x t s 1 t x s x s x t σ 2 1 n w t w 1 n ε t ε t 2 where n is the length of the time series y t i e total number of data samples w is the moving window size determining by the bandwidth h which defined as a fraction of the number of observations in the sample β t 1 is the ordinary least squares ols estimate of regression coefficients of eq 2 based on the observations up to t 1 and ε t and σ 2 are the corresponding residues and variance estimated on the history period we used the strucchange package zeileis et al 2002 with the r software environment r core team 2014 for detecting and dating the unknown break points of the model 2 the foundation for estimating change point for regression model was developed by bai 1994 and was extended to multiple change points detection by bai 1997 and bai and perron 1998 the sequential procedures can be summarized into two steps as follows 1 the first step checks for existence of structural change based on the assumption that variability of the mosum is structural stability therefore follows a brownian motion i e random walk with an expected mean of zero in other words if the time series is stable all residuals and hence their mosum values should fluctuate closely around zero if the mosum crosses the 95 confidence boundary which follows the functional central limit theorem leisch et al 2000 then structural change is detected 2 the second step determines the number and location of change points when structural change is detected in the first step the sample is split in two and the testing then starts in the two segments this recursive process continues until no more break point is detected the maximum number of change breaks is related to the bandwidth h and we used h 0 15 to allow for a maximum of 6 break points in this study the optimal number of change points is determined by minimizing the bayesian information criterion bic and the residual sum of squares rss with m change points detected the regression model 2 was fitted to m 1 segments or regimes and the m 1 vectors of coefficient are estimated 4 y t α j yj t 1 β j x j ε t t t j 1 1 t j j 1 m 1 we referred the piecewise regression in eq 4 as regime switching model rsm piecewise linear models as a special case of non linear regression are often used as approximations to complex phenomena to extract basic features of the data zeileis et al 2003 we also ran one way anova to compare model 2 and model 4 in addition as all the variables are standardized their relative contribution to lake water level at each regime is directly comparable 3 results 3 1 trends in hydrological and climatic variables and their seasonality the river flow at zhicheng the station at yangtze immediately upstream the three outfalls flowing to dongting lake had no trend for the entire time series p 0 564 however the correlated seasonal mann kendall test indicated that there was a significant increasing trend in jan feb and mar and a significant decreasing trend in sep oct and nov table 1 the total inflows from yangtze delivered by the three outfalls showed a significantly decreasing trend for each month and the decrease was significant for the entire time series table 1 the inflows from the four major tributary rivers had no trends for all months except mar in which increase trend was significant p 0 031 for spei at dongting region the correlated seasonal mann kendall testing results suggested no trends for every month except september p 0 043 and an overall increasing trend was detected p 0 045 table 1 the water level at chenglingji had a significantly positive trend for jan feb and mar and significantly negative trend for oct table 1 overall the trend was positive however for discharge the negative trend for the period of july to december was significant in addition only mar showed a significantly positive trend these trend analyses revealed little about the river lake relationships 3 2 breakpoints and regimes in river lake relationship the mosum process indicated that there were several occasions when the mosum crossed the 95 boundaries fig 2 a this visual observation of the existence of breakpoints was confirmed by statistical test m0 3 77 p 0 01 the bic suggested that models with three and four change points were equally supported by the data fig 2b because the δbic was 2 for the two bic was 908 58 and 910 78 for the three and four change points models respectively anderson and burnham 1998 however we presented and reported the model with four break points as it had lower rss residual sum of squares than the model with three break points fig 2b the four identified breakpoints corresponded to five regimes during the period of 1961 2014 mar 1961 jun 1972 jul 1972 jun 1980 jul 1980 dec 1997 jan 2000 aug 2006 and sep 2006 dec 2014 table 2 3 3 trends for individual regimes we divided the entire time series into five segments according to the identified regimes and performed correlated seasonal mann kendall test for each of them table 3 the lake water level decreased till regime 5 after which it increased significantly however the decline was significant at 5 level only for regime 1 similarly the discharge from dongting lake also decreased for the first four regimes the decrease was significant for regimes 1 and 2 and increased significantly during regime 5 for flows from the three outlets inflow1 significant decrease was detected till regime 5 after which it showed an increasing trend albeit not significant at 5 level inflows from the four tributaries inflow2 decreased significantly for regime 2 and 3 but did not change significantly for other regimes for river flows in yangtze river at zhicheng it decreased significantly during regimes 1 and changes in other regimes was not significantly at 5 level as with the test using entire time series the changes in spei was not significant during any regime 3 4 the evolution of the river lake relationship the regime switching model had much higher adjusted r2 the adjusted r2 93 65 and 83 96 for regime switching and standard models respectively the anova confirmed the superior performance of the regime switching model over the standard one df 20 f 26 79 p 0 001 furthermore the residuals of the regime shift model the variations in water level index which were not accounted for had no trend according to the csmk test p 0 656 for overall and ranged 0 365 to 0 976 for every month while there was still a significant trend in the residuals of the standard model overall p 0 001 fig 3 visualized the fitted regime switching model the two models were undistinguishable for normal hydrological conditions i e sfi between 1 and 1 however the regime switching model fitted the extreme values i e floods and droughts better than the standard model did in most cases fig 3 the first regime 1961 1972 was dominated by hydrological droughts during which several severe droughts i e 1963 1967 1969 and 1972 fig 3 occurred in the dongting region including the longest drought sep 1971 oct 1972 for the entire study period fig 3 normal conditions prevailed the second 1972 1980 and the third 1981 1997 regimes as majority of the sfi was within the 1 5 thresholds although there were some brief droughts and floods for example the flood in the 1982 83 winter fig 3 the fourth regime 1998 2006 was predominated by wet conditions and several floods including the most damaging one i e 1998 in recent history zong and chen 2000 dry condition prevailed the fifth regime 2006 2014 with four severe droughts recorded i e 2006 2009 2011 and 2013 fig 3 in addition the severest drought during the study period fell in this regime i e 2006 fig 3 the river lake relationship could be interpreted from fitted coefficients of the regression models table 4 as all predictor variables are standardized their contributions to the water level fluctuations in dongting lake could be directly compared based on the fitted coefficients generally local climatic conditions characterized by spei had the least contribution to water level variation moreover the effects of spei on water level variations was not significant for regimes 2 and 4 note that the relative importance of the local spei was substantially higher and was comparable to that of the inflow 2 indicated by the standard regression model table 4 in comparison with the inflows from the four tributaries inflows from the yangtze always had higher influence on the water level fluctuations at dongting as the coefficient of inflow 1 was larger than that of the inflow 2 for all regimes table 4 however the relative importance of the inflow from the yangtze river to water level variability in dongting decreased gradually from regime 1 to regime 5 but regime 2 during which the contributions of two inflows were comparable coefficient for inflows 1 and 2 were 0 385 and 0 362 respectively table 4 4 discussion during the study period the dongting lake has experienced unprecedented anthropogenic changes including hydrological regulations and land reclamation yin et al 2007 these changes have fundamental impacts on the river floodplain relationship resulting in rapid alternation in hydrological and sediment regimes yin et al 2007 ou et al 2012 with significant hydrodynamic and morphodynamic consequences in the associated floodplains lauer and parker 2008 marchetti et al 2016 ultimately these changes would lead to imminent and disastrous loss in ecosystem services at local and regional scale costanza et al 2014 guan et al 2016 to ensure the long term ecological security soft e g adjusting dam operation to partially reinstall flow regimes and hard e g construction of low level levees to retain flow for longer time engineering solutions are increasingly being used in an attempt to reverse these historical impacts of flow regulations wang et al 2006 however better understanding of the dynamic river floodplain coupling is urgently required to minimize the potential risks associated with these restoration efforts in this study we first confirmed the existence of seasonal trends in the standardized climatic and river flow time series using correlated seasonal mann kendall test we then used regime switch dynamic linear regression rsm to model water level fluctuations through cycles of flooding and drying as a function of key inflows and climatic drivers the empirical rsm framework allowed us to investigate the evolution of river floodplain relationship and relative contribution of different water sources to lake water level variation our results indicated that there were five regimes over the last five decades during which the effects of inflows and local climate condition on the lake water level changed significantly fig 3 although the importance of yangtze inflows was greater than that of the tributaries flows over the five regimes table 4 it gradually decreased from regime 1 to regime 5 note that the long term average contributions in term of total volume is 37 1 and 54 6 for the three outfalls and the four tributaries respectively yin et al 2007 the disproportional importance of flows from the three outfalls may be attributed to the higher inter annual flow variations table 1 in addition the effect of local climate was much smaller than these of inflows and it was not significant at regimes 2 and 4 at 5 level finally we investigated the trends in hydrological variables for each regime using the same csmk test the identified trends including the direction and degree of change provided new insights to the evolution of river floodplain relationship which were well corresponding to the natural variations and anthropogenic modifications these details could not be revealed by trend or change point analysis using the entire time series 4 1 regime 1 jan 1961 jun 1972 this period coincided with the rapid land reclamation in the middle yangtze region yin et al 2007 during which about 1000 km2 of lake area was converted into cropland du et al 2011 the decrease in surface water area should have caused an upward tendency in lake water level and discharge however both discharge and lake water level decreased significantly during this period suggesting other factors played predominant roles in regulating lake water balance of the variables investigated in the study local climate and inflows from the four tributaries had no significant trend during this period and only inflows from the yangtze via the three outfalls showed significant decrease which was coincident with the significant decline in yangtze river flows table 3 the disagreement between inflows from the four tributaries and river flows in the yangtze at zhicheng thereby inflows via the three outfalls suggested that the prevailing climate in the upstream catchment may not always be synchronous with that at middle catchment moreover mann kendall s score suggested that the decrease in inflows via the three outfalls was greater than that of the river flows in the yangtze this might be caused by the blockage of tiaoxiankou in 1958 which used to be the fourth outfall also the meander cut off of jingjiang river reach during 1967 to 1972 resulted in river bed scour and the stream water level dropping in the river segment of the yangtze where the three outfalls were located ou et al 2012 wang et al 2017 the prevailing role of flows from the three outfalls in controlling the water balance in dongting lake was also confirmed by the estimated coefficient of the regime switching model 4 2 regime 2 jul 1973 jun 1980 the water level in dongting lake continued to decline although the trend was not significant nevertheless water discharge from the lake decreased significantly during this period lake reclamation continued but at a much lower rate du et al 2011 however both inflows from the yangtze via the three outfalls and the four tributaries decreased significantly and the effects of the two inflows on lake water level were comparable in contrast to significant decreasing trend in inflows to the lake river flows in the yangtze mainstream was relatively stable although decreased slightly the disproportional decrease in inflows via the three outfalls indicated that river bed building up was unalleviated and the channel capacity continued to shrink yin et al 2007 wang et al 2017 gezhouba gzb the first large dam on the yangtze initiated in the end of 1970 and started dam closing in march 1980 likely played a role in driving the regime shift in april 1980 4 3 regime 3 jul 1980 dec 1997 despite the significant decline in flows from both inflows both discharge and lake water level had no significant trend at 5 level albeit the trends were generally negative although the river flow in yangtze river as measured at zhicheng remained relatively stable during this period the inflows via the three outfalls continuously declined significantly an indication of the continuity of channel capacity shrinkage with water level dropping in the main stream of yangtze caused by river bed scour downstream gzb tang et al 2001 moreover the effects of flow via the three outfalls regained dominance for regulating lake water level the change point in 1997 has not previously been reported hydrologic alteration happened in different phases of dam construction it may start at river close e g partial regulation before final dam closure and complete regulation grams et al 2007 as first phase of tgd construction river closing occurred in november 1997 and may have triggered this regime shift 4 4 regime 4 jan 1998 aug 2006 as with regime 3 both discharge and lake water level had no significant trend at 5 level albeit the trends were generally negative the closure of tgd and impounding of tgd reservoir occurred in this regime ou et al 2012 these led to the significant decrease in yangtze river flows downstream of the tgd which was confirmed by the csmk test table 3 also sun et al 2012 yu et al 2013 however the decrease river flows in the yangtze was only partly responsible for the significant decreasing trend in flows via the three outfalls which showed a much sharper decreasing tendency the disproportional large decline in flow through the three outfalls for the first four regimes indicated the persistence of channel capacity shrinkage caused by siltation du et al 2001 in a study of the water and sediments balance in dongting lake chen 2016 also found a shift in 1998 which was in the 95 confident level bracket of the identified change point in our study i e feb 1997 to dec 1998 table 2 similarly han et al 2016 tested the year of 1999 as changing point using flow records at yichang a gauging station downstream of tgd and 59 km upstream zhicheng spei and the inflows from the four tributaries showed no significant trend in this regime the discrepancy between the trends in lake water level and inflows from the three outfalls might indicate the hydrological forcing of the yangtze started to weaken after more than four decades of continuous decline in flows 4 5 regime 5 sep 2006 dec 2014 this was the only regime when all investigated time series showed significantly positive trends at 10 level only water level had significantly increasing trend at 5 level moreover the direction and degree of change in yangtze flow at zhicheng and inflow via the three outfalls was similar for the first time the impounding and full operation of three gorges reservoir in sep 2006 was possibly the main anthropogenic factor responsible for this regime change sediment dynamics in dongting lake changed from siltation to erosion in 2006 hu et al 2015 chen 2016 the operation of tgd has dramatically reduced downstream sedimentation and siltation du et al 2011 particularly in dongting sun et al 2012 the reduction in sediment concentration in river flow might have slowed down or even reversed channel bed build up goldschneider et al 2007 resulting a relative stable river flow discharge relationship the synchronized dynamics of lake and river hydrology might mark the start of new stabilized river lake relationships after the operation of tgd and should be closely monitored 5 conclusion in summary we proposed a two step regime switch modelling rsm framework to detect and quantify regime shifts in dynamic multiple linear regression first mosum process was used to detect and date change points in dynamic multiple linear regression the entire time series was then segmented into regimes according to the dates of identified change points and a piecewise dynamic multiple linear regression was fitted to quantify the coefficients for each regime we applied this approach to the long term water level time series 1961 2014 in dongting lake exploring the dynamics of river floodplain relationship the resulted regime shifts were retrospectively traceable to the major events occurred upon the yangtze river such as the impounding of three gorges reservoir and full operation of the tgd demonstrating the practicality of rsm in this case study anthropogenic manipulations particularly river regulation and dams were supposed to be the main drivers weakening connectivity between yangtze river and its floodplain the change points in 1997 and 2006 first revealed by our study provided new references for tipping point study on ecological regime shift synchronous to hydrologic alteration especially water birds inhabiting in the middle yangtze

7428,isotopic and chemical data on the mineral water mud volcanoes fluid and associated gases from the biggest russian island sakhalin together with previous stable isotope data d18o dd 13c allow elucidation of their origin and general evolution the water fluid circulation is mainly related to marine environment inducing three distinct types na hco3 cl alkali carbonate groundwaters na cl hco3 highly evolved saline and na cl mature groundwaters indicating different evolution chemical evolution of groundwater on sakhalin island demonstrated cation exchange and salinization as dominant evolutionary pathways isotopic composition of groundwaters varies from meteoric to metamorphic waters these metamorphic waters consist of water hydration from the clay and seawater are traced in fluids of yuzhno sakhalin mud volcano despite modification by mixing with meteoric waters and water rock interaction processes fault systems that define the areas of highly mineralized water circulation appear to play a major role in the co2 migration to the surface and ch4 generation the δ13c co2 values have pointed that gas phase in high pco2 waters mostly consists of mantle derived co2 the carbon isotope signature of methane δ13c ch4 and δd ch4 indicates its distinct origin which is specified by tectonics methane manifestation in the south of the sakhalin island is mainly related to thermogenic reservoirs as they are more often dislocate by tectonics and crossed by active and permeable faults the sources of biogenous methane in the north of sakhalin island is related to younger and shallower reservoirs and less affected by tectonic processes the determinations of 222rn have allowed observing that maximal radon flux is associated with high pco2 waters keywords mineral water

the mineral water resources of the sakhalin are known since the 18th century but first significant regional investigations were carried in 1951 aver ev 1957 ivanov and nevraev 1964 chapovskiy and ravdonikas 1972 for the last 15 years investigations were focused on the origin of the ch4 gas phase in low temperature thermal waters with no data on the minor and trace elements astakhov et al 2002 obzhirov et al 2002 shakirov et al 2004 shakirov and syrbu 2012 the first attempt to elucidate the genesis of cold mineral waters and mud volcanoes fluids on sakhalin island has been made in the recent years chelnokov et al 2015a b preliminary results have shown that the mineral waters and associated gases not only indicate geochemical processes but also represent the earthquake preparation markers chelnokov et al 2015a b it should be noted that the sakhalin island is considered to be the most seismically active region of russia despite the vast literature and numerous studies of rn geochemistry reported for various regions in the world the behavior of rn in the groundwater systems of the sakhalin had never been studied the geological structures of the sakhalin island are formed as a result of mountain formation process activation folding faulting volcanism and other geodynamic processes during the alpine folding epoch the position of sakhalin island astride the eurasian and north american plates e g nokleberg et al 2005 a broad range of tectonic settings and deformation fronts had developed through time the geological development of the fold system is well defined in the geochemical and hydrogeochemical processes occurring in their depths multiple manifestations of thermal and mineral waters of different composition oil and gas deposits indicate these processes on the territory of sakhalin island and its shelf as well the primary goal of this work was to investigate the geochemistry of waters and associated gases and overview of the role of tectonic setting in their origin and distribution from the global perspective the significance of this study relates to the ability to use the geochemical data from mineral springs as a short term earthquake precursors this paper also describes important issues of the crustal radiogenic gases generation and the overall radiation safety from rn presented findings provide new hydrogeochemical information for the sakhalin island which was previously available only scarcely 2 geological and geomorphological setting more than twenty mineral spring and four mud volcanoes are known at sakhalin island fig 1 chapovskiy and ravdonikas 1972 nearly 90 of the spring systems are cold while others are thermal with discharge temperature less than 50 c many manifestations of cold mineral water do not discharge as springs 7 8 11 18 19 20 on fig 1 the upflows were discovered during drilling of wells for domestic use or industrial exploration of coal oil or gas only several mineral springs 13 14 21 are used for spa treatment chelnokova 2006 but in general they are not actively developed the geological and topographic characteristics of the sakhalin island are closely related to the plate interaction processes which are specified by dislocation on the boundary of the okhotsk and amurian plate e g zonenshain et al 1990 maruyama et al 1997 biebow et al 2000 rodnikov et al 2001 voeikova et al 2007 however in recent years the sakhalin structure was interpreted as the boundary between the mesozoic plates with different versions of the boundary properly being drawn along the west and central sakhalin regional faults wei and seno 1998 trifonov and kozhurin 2010 prytkov et al 2012 the sakhalin island is owed to the sakhalin hokkaido orogenic belt and is characterized by well defined tectonic zonality fully represented on the hokkaido island japan and reflecting the successive accumulation of continental crust from the middle jurassic to neogene e g niida and kito 1986 kiminami et al 1992 dobretsov et al 1994 isozaki 1996 grannik 2005 golozoubov 2006 jahn et al 2016 the oldest rocks are paleozoic ophiolites and associated sedimentary rocks which may have got their origin in the breakup of the proterozoic supercontinent maruyama et al 1997 however the majority of the basement consists of jurassic to paleogene rocks taira et al 1989 cenozoic granitoids of hokkaido and sakhalin have remarkably similar chemical and isotopic characteristics suggesting that the granitoids have been generated by melting of sources with mixed lithologies including subducted accretionary complexes and probably some hidden older basement rocks jahn et al 2016 paleogene strata overlie the nappes and the folded structures are cut by intrusions of biotitic granites and granodiorites with an isotopic age of 58 66 ma zonenshain et al 1990 most mineral spring systems 9 10 12 13 15 20 are distributed within the west sakhalin uplift fig 1 between two main tectonic dislocations of the island west sakhalin i and central sakhalin ii faults systems these boundaries might be responsible for many strong earthquakes that have occurred in the sea of japan as well as on the sakhalin island the west sakhalin anticlinoria overstretching over 650 km from the south to the north of the island was formed in the miocene 15 ma it is considered to be an evolution equivalent of the sorach ezo orogenic belt on the hokkaido island japan arita 1999 grannik 2005 the structural denudation landscape is typical for the west sakhalin mountains the absolute heights vary between 300 m and 1300 m the tectonic uplift is initially responsible for the deep river incision a decline in the sea level of 110 130 m which has occurred during the pleistocene climatic minimum of 18 20 ka bp korotky 1997 the east sakhalin uplift is composed of actively dislocated metamorphic pre cretaceous rocks hidaka belt this is due to the tectonic uplift of the basement rocks that have occurred during the collision with the kuril forearc taira 2001 there is no data relating to mineral springs located in this part of the sakhalin island and no samples have been obtained the central sakhalin graben is identified

ridge uplift is the east boundary of the depression and is represented by slivers of the cretaceous tertiary accretionary prisms idonnappu and hidaka belts fig 1 central sakhalin thrust and nappes fault are a border between aniva depression and the west sakhalin uplift on the west the most fascinated mineral waters and mud volcanoes on the island are distributed within this contact 1 7 8 11 18 on fig 1 the low hills and plains of the northern sakhalin are composed of gently inclined and folded neogene strata and are shaped by abrasion and denudation the depressions located in its central part are filled with unconsolidated quaternary alluvial sediments the marine depositional plains occupy coastal areas the western coast is represented with cliffs reaching 8 10 m height in the north and 60 80 m in the south the low temperature thermal waters manifestations are connected with oil gas condensate fields on the shelf the continuing uplift of the island results in high seismic activity with earthquakes reaching 8 points on the richter scale tanaka and nozawa 1977 the shallow seismicity of sakhalin island is traditionally attributed to its main meridional thrust faults tikhonov and lomtev 2014 based on gps observations the island is moving westward at the rate of from 2 5 mm yr in the north to 7 6 mm yr in the south over the entire extent of the island the dominating deformations are those of sub latitudinal compression accompanied by right lateral strike slip shestakov et al 2011 the heat flow distribution calculated by the 3 d model tanaka et al 2004 has marked that the south of the sakhalin island relates to the backarc zone of low surface heat flow in summary mineral waters of the sakhalin island discharge over a wide range of geological settings including continental back arc rifting in the west sakhalinian uplift an ancient accretionary prism in the south and sedimentary basins in the north 3 sampling and analytical techniques the

using electrolytic enrichment and subsequent measurement of counting rates details of sample preparation for 3h analysis are described by goriachev 1997 the standard deviation was 0 3 1 1 tu depending on the 3h concentration the program of radon monitoring at the sinegorsky high pco2 spa was initiated in june 2014 as a part of the present investigation the continuous soil rn monitoring was carried out using a seismic radon station srs 05 lukianov et al 2014 http ntm ru products 133 7282 soil radon rn was measured continuously at 20 min interval using alpha particle detectors the measuring range

lunsky and dagi fresh shallow and main river waters were also tested additionally some data from aver ev 1957 seletsky 1992 chelnokova 2006 and lavrushin 2012 were considered and re interpreted during this study sample locations are indicated on fig 1 summary is given in table 1 4 1 water chemistry the chemical composition of studied waters is listed in table 1 and on the piper diagram fig 2 which demonstrates the proportions between the water components river waters are represented by cations and anion mixed types na hco3 na ca hco3 na cl hco3 na ca cl hco3 the typical total dissolved solids concentration for river waters is 0 1 0 2 g l highest tds 0 26 1 0 g l cl na br and b concentrations are specific for water samples from the estuarine parts of the rivers nelbutta hankotan or waters exposed to deep fluids volchansky creek piper divided groundwaters into two major groups i alkali carbonate na hco3 cl na ca hco3 groundwaters and ii saline groundwaters of na cl and na cl hco3 types the majority of the groundwaters from the first group 7 8 9 10 are characterized by mineralization less than 0 6 g l the ph varies from 6 5 to 9 1 and redox potential from 224 to 160 mv the hco3 cl ratios 1 8 9 4 correspond to hco3 rich mineral waters where na and ca are dominating cations br and b are presented in concentrations 0 01 1 2 mg l and 0 2 0 8 mg l respectively waters have a good correlation between hco3 and tds r 0 73 tds and cl r 0 83 na and cl r 0 91 springs from the sw coast of the island indicate elevated concentrations of so4 and have a strong smell of h2s 9 10 table 1 the maximum h2s concentration in the gases is 1 1 in cold mineral springs with shallow geochemical characteristics 9 10 here h2s aqueous is transformed to 2h so4 2 through oxidation of h2s in the vadose zone e g white 1957 it could also be associated with sulfur bearing bacteria below the water surface suggesting biogenically mediated so4 reduction reyes et al 2010 the second group groundwaters are generally cold t 8 11 c except to springs on the n ne of the island 13 14 21 table 1 with temperatures 35 50 c tds changes significantly from 0 4 to 21 3 g l up to 26 g l in mud volcanoes fluid the ph changes from 6 3 to 9 2 the eh values indicate reducing conditions 315 to 60 mv the na dominates as cation species ranging from 120 to 7000 mg l the molar na cl ratios vary from 0 8 to 1 7 the concentrations of alkali metals so4 si fe mn and trace elements i ba b br are very high table 1 local enrichments also occur in relatively immobile elements such as as and sr while values of al could be compared with other analyzed water types whereas f concentrations in this group are the lowest and even less than the detection limit the si contents of the spring waters are less than 50 mg l suggesting that they have not been heated to over 100 c saline groundwaters can be subdivided by hco3 cl ratios into two genetic groups na cl mature waters with ratio values less than 0 5 and na cl hco3 highly evolved waters with ratio values varying from 0 5 to 1 50 fig 2 4 2 fate of chemical heterogeneity the analyzed groundwaters are characterized by an heterogeneous chemical composition there are three major natural processes in addition to chemical reactions such as oxidation reduction reactions that commonly contribute to the observed chemistry of groundwaters simple mixing cation exchange and dissolution of minerals in order to explore the mechanism of salinity the plot of na versus cl is widely used magaritz et al 1981 dixon and chiswell 1992 the concentration of cl is well correlated with na for all studied waters suggesting that the dissolution of halite may be the major source of na and cl theoretically the dissolution of halite will release equal amounts of na and cl into the solution nevertheless the results deviate from the anticipated 1 1 relationship fig 3 a alkali carbonate water and na cl hco3 mixed waters samples show higher concentrations of sodium than chlorine the molar na cl molar ratio varies from 1 06 to 4 73 with an average value of 2 12 a greater na cl ratio may be ascribed to the feldspar weathering and the dissolution of other na containing minerals herczeg and edmunds 2000 grasby et al 1999 alcalá and custodio 2008 the relatively high na concentration in the groundwater could also be a reflection of cation exchange between na and ca 2 or mg 2 the cl br mass ratios are presented in this paper the cl and br concentrations are highly correlated for all groundwaters spearman s rank correlation coefficient 0 96 for 31 samples mass ratios of cl to br range from 318 to 803 average 456 fig 3b for all saline groundwaters which is an indication of fresh water and nacl dissolution components rittenhouse 1967 contamination by saltwater intrusion evidently to be present locally on sakhalin island samples 18 19 20 and 21 appear to have characteristics of advanced saltwater intrusion the na cl molar ratios for 18 19 20 and 21 are very similar to that of the seawater na cl seawater ratio is 0 85 the slightly less ratios can be directly attributed to the fact that fresh groundwater mixes with seawater fig 3a demonstrates that na cl ratios of these groundwaters show a narrow scatter around the seawater line the cl br ratios also indicate potential saltwater intrusion however 18 19 20 and 21 have br concentrations of 21 6 12 1 6 6 and 8 8 mg l respectively these br concentrations are below the 67 mg l recorded for seawater because the overall mixture is diluted however the ratios of cl br are nearly the same 318 388 suggesting that relatively fresh groundwaters are mixing with seawater banks et al 1991 heinrich et al 1993 yardley et al 1993 meere and banks 1997 mccaig et al 2000 because seawater is present at depth beneath island it is difficult to say if this is connate seawater or modern seawater the dynamics of this system are not fully understood but are be the focus of ongoing research regardless of the age of the saline water at depth the chemistry of the groundwater indicates mixing with seawater furthermore the observed distribution of dissolved constituents in groundwater such as i and b may be linked to the complex geological history and may associate with old seawater incursion allen and matsuo 2002 the large concentrations of iodine 0 3 14 0 mg l in saline waters are explained by the high organic enrichment as a result of diagenesis and consolidation iodine is transferred from the sediment to the pore fluid this process is facilitated by the elevated temperatures 32 40 c in the deeper layers shishkina 1969 mineral saturation indices may provide insight into the nature of chemical processes thatcontrol solute concentrations in groundwaters saturation indices si in groundwaters have been calculated for minerals commonly observed in the marine sediments the computer code phreeqc plummer et al 1991 was utilized for these calculations fig 4 a indicates the calculated values of si for calcite and dolomite for all groundwater samples as variable showing both undersaturation and supersaturation with respect to the carbonates it is noticeable that na cl hco3 saline water 11 and mud volcanos fluids 16 17 are more saturated with respect to dolomite than with calcite the explanation could be as following 1 incongruent dissolution of dolomite 2 preferential precipitation of dolomite with respect to calcite 3 preferential exchange of ca 2 for mg 2 in cation exchange reactions with clay minerals drever 1982 there is no evidence for present carbonate layers within the stratigraphic section and no travertine within water discharge but well studied all of the world mud volcanoes fluid support suggestion of cation exchange reactions with clay minerals lavrushin 2012 this process is known as base exchange softening providing that there is a reservoir of sodium ions adsorbed onto clay minerals calcium and or magnesium ions in the water will preferentially attach to the exchange sites and the sodium will be ejected and transferred into the water elevated phs i e lower h concentrations large surface areas and long residence times favor the cation exchange process stumm and morgan 1996 increased na concentration coupled with decreased ca 2 and mg 2 concentrations are also indicative of cation exchange henderson 1984 the elevated levels of boron in groundwaters from this group can be also explained by the base exchange softening process other types of waters are in equilibrium or undersaturated relative to carbonates sicalcite 0 09 0 1 sidolomite 2 0 07 all groundwater samples are under saturated with respect to halite thus proving the conservative nature not getting easily oversaturated of sodium and chloride fig 4b thermodynamic calculations indicate that all saline groundwaters are oversaturated relative to the primary aluminosilicate minerals sialbite 1 2 2 8 quarts siquartz 0 4 1 2 and hydroxides sihematite 9 2 17 4 3 isotopic composition of waters the δh and δ18o studied fluids contents are shown in fig 3 and reported in table 1 these data indicate that meteoric precipitation is the common source of na ca hco3 surface water fig 5 b deuterium excess value is higher than 7 up to 16 1 that corresponds to present day precipitation over the region chelnokov et al 2013 kharitonova et al 2013 the tritium value for surface waters of the sakhalin island varies from 6 5 to 8 3 tu the data can be used as a reference number for the preliminary estimation of the residence time for the groundwaters the na hco3 cl groundwaters are different from the surface waters with varying d excess from 11 9 to 9 1 and a range of tritium from 1 to 11 tu only one sample of the groundwater from borehole 8 8 in table 1 showed 2h 18o and 3h enrichment the chemical and the isotopic influence for this shallow well can be explained by its location on the active part of the central sakhalin fault within the area of the sinegorsky spa for the antonovsky spring 10 the content of 3h 7 1 tu which makes it comparable to the surface water whereas the nevelsky spring 9 and water from boreholes 7 8 have lower tritium content 1 0 2 0 tu these isotopic features suggest mixing between the recent recharge and an older component the isotopic composition of na cl hco3 and na cl saline groundwater is variable the typical and the most evident geothermal 18o shift has been detected in the sinegorsky area of the cold pco2 waters d excess 39 to 64 fig 5a these values are related to isotopes of the yuzhno sakhalinsky mud volcano fluid seletsky 1992 chelnokov et al 2015a b and lay within the range of values for arc type magmatic water giggenbach 1992 or for waters derived from dehydration of marine clays in pore waters expelled during sediment compaction at temperatures of up to 200 c seletsky 1978 giggenbach 1995 lavrushin et al 1996 dahlmann de lange 2003 thus the proportion of clay water of hydration in the jurassic accretionary prism waters 11 is roughly 20 40 also 3h concentrations are below the detection limit indicating a mean transit time greater than 60 years only one well from this site showed the presence of tritium 2 1 tu the presence 3h in these deep aquifers is caused by either leakage from other aquifers or contamination as a result of the exploitation casing column problem the cl rich waters of amursky and aniva wells 19 20 fig 5b have a slight 18o enrichment less than 20 of which is most likely derived from the clay water of hydration besides high resolution tritium analyses show very low but measurable levels of tritium in all samples of the deep na cl waters located on the southwest of sakhalin island that also could be evidence of seawater intrusion or mixing processes in contrast the high pco2 na cl hco3 waters of the volchansky spa 12 located in the middle part of the island lie close to the gmwl fig 5a and have 3h content compared with surface waters table 1 deuterium excess 0 3 8 5 which is less than in meteoric water indicates mixing of the recent recharge and deep water thermal waters in the north 13 14 21 are the most depleted by the isotopes among all studied waters but tritium contents for these samples are slightly above the detection limit table 1 these isotopic features suggest that thermal waters result from a mixture between the recent recharge and an older component recharge under cold climatic conditions 4 4 chemical and isotopic composition of gases the components of associated gases from the studied fluids are presented in table 2 carbon dioxide and methane are the main components of the gases in the springs and mud volcanoes fluids methane is very abundant 70 vol in the gas phase associated with the thermal springs 13 14 21 n2 and o2 are less than 28 vol and 1 6 vol respectively the maximum h2s concentration in the gases is 1 1 in cold mineral springs with shallow geochemical characteristics 9 10 helium content varies with the full range of the first tens of ppm in the thermal areas and mud volcanoes to hundreds of ppm in high pco2 waters it should be noted that mineral springs with similar isotopic water and gas characteristics were discovered and studied in papua new guinea baylis et al 1996 the current data on inert gases ar he and their isotopes are limited the available data lavrushin 2012 allowed us to suppose the major sources of gas components for studied mineral springs the he ar ratios indicate that gases are associated with the jurassic accretionary prism waters 11 18 and the yuzhno sakhalinsky mud volcano 16 are rich with magmatic basaltic component he ar ratio 0 2 0 5 vs 0 001 in the meteoric component giggenbach 1992 whereas gases from the east sakhalin uplift 12 have lower he ar ratio 0 07 the data from thermal springs indicate that gases originate mainly from air dissolved in meteoric water descending to the reservoir rather than contributed by magmatic gas from the deeper part of the reservoir he ar 0 02 0 03 he isotopic ratio 3he 4he in the mid ocean ridge basalt morb which represents a mean upper mantle value varies around 1 10 5 ozima and podosek 2002 the mantle and atmospheric value 3he 4he 1 3 1 4 10 6 that is much higher than typical crustal rock 3he 4he production ratios 1 10 8 andrews 1985 the 3he 4he ratios available for the sakhalin island lavrushin et al 1996 suggest that gases associated with thermal springs 13 14 21 3he 4he 2 9 2 7 10 7 and volchansky high pco2 area 12 3he 4he 9 10 7 are derived from the crust whereas he derived within the central sakhalin fault 3he 4he 4 4 10 6 11 16 18 and 3he 4he 3 2 10 6 17 has a typical mantle derived helium signature which is close to the 3he 4he ratios of circum pacific volcanic gases poreda and craig 1989 sano and wakita 1985 as a result at least two different sources of he flux exist within the mineral springs of the sakhalin island 1 mantle he flux through the central sakhalin fault system to the south of the island and 2 crustal he produced in the geological formations the isotopic investigations of associated gases have been conducted for fluids located within the south part of central sakhalin fault 11 16 18 and the thermal springs 13 14 21 table 2 carbon isotopic properties are commonly used to classify natural gases colombo et al 1965 stahl 1973 schoell 1980 1983 the values of δ13cpdb for co2 of the sinegorsky spa waters 11 18 vary from 6 to 30 0 depending on the primary associated gas co2 or ch4 table 2 it suggests the presence of a deep seated mantle co2 origin 4 to 8 whiticar et al 1994 if for high pco2 waters it is typical in contrast to waters where volumes of associated gases co2 and ch4 are equal to the range of δ13c co2 values of fossil fuels is wide the reason is the complicated biogeochemical processes that are involved in the degradation of the organic matter into natural gas liquid petroleum and coal values δ13c co2 for coals lie between 18 and 30 degens and ross 1969 consequently δ13c co2 value 30 0 could point out on degassing zones where co2 originates from the coal bearing beds shakirov and syrbu 2012 it should be noted that an abandoned coal mine is located 10 km nw from the sinegorsky spa the obtained values of δ13c ch4 for the sinegorsky high pco2 mineral water vary from 30 7 to 27 5 namely δ13c signature of the ch4 emitted from the marine sediments indicates its thermogenic origin to examine this conclusion we have measured a δd ch4 content in contrast to the δ13c properties the δd properties of methane do not appear to show an apparent thermal maturity dependency schoell 1980 whiticar et al 1994 hydrogen isotopic properties provide details on the depositional environment and formation pathways such as microbial reduction of co2 or acetate fermentation whiticar et al 1994 the derived value 84 2 is too high for the marine or terrestrial microbial methane and it indicates the thermogenic methane is formed by the heat induced decay of the organic matter whiticar et al 1994 the yuzhno sakhalinsky mv has very similar isotopic characteristics with sinegorsky high pco2 waters data on fig 6 a and b show thermogenic characteristics with a migration trend to a mixing zone the data for the pugachev mv indicate another gas genesis the genetic characterization of the gas by variation in δd and δ13c in methane schoell 1983 shows that it is a mixture of the bacterial gas derived from continental environments and the oil associated thermogenic gas fig 6a in fact the value of δd ch4 264 corresponds to methane produced by fermentation processes in the fresh water environments 250 to 400 smow woltemate et al 1984 and the bernard diagram fig 6b supports a biogenic origin of methane from the pugachev mv the volume of δ13c co2 also indicates biogeochemical processes that are involved in the degradation of the organic matter table 2 the data δd ch4 are unavailable for thermal springs 13 14 21 of the island but the substantial depletion of the δ13c indicates a biogenic origin probably with some thermogenic component shakirov and syrbu 2012 the biogenic classification of the hydrocarbons is clearly illustrated in diagram suggested by bernard bernard et al 1976 fig 6b biogenic methane originates by two major pathways i co2 reduction and ii acetate type fermentation the co2 reduction is dominant in marine sediments as the precursor acetate is oxidized to co2 in the sulfate reducing zone whiticar and faber 1985 in the natural environment the methane generated by co2 reduction tends to be more depleted in 13c 60 than that formed by acetate type fermentation 13c 60 the methane δ13c measured for dagi hot springs is expected for methanogenesis by co2 reduction from the other side world terrestrial mud volcano investigations etiope et al 2009 demonstrate that the d13c data between 60 and 50 could be false biogenic and due to molecular fractionation of the mixed gas the most isotopically heavy 13c ch4 and light 13c co2 among studied thermal waters have been retrieved from the lesogorsky thermal spring 13 it could be explained by partial biogenic methane oxidizing to co2 in upper oxygen reach sedimentary zones e g ch4 2o2 co2 2h2o or 2ch4 o2 3 76 n2 2co 4h2 3 76 n2 as a result this reactions δ13c of co2 are expected to be isotopically light 4 5 radon anomalies a groundwater radon monitoring of mineral springs of the sakhalin island has been carried out to investigate the correlation between radon anomalies and the seismic activity of the region many of the springs have high rn contents which are also related to the seismic activity chelnokov et al 2016 radon is considered to be a significant tectonic activity precursor due to its limited informational content caused by a relatively short half life period of 3 82 days since temperature and conductivity of water can control the solubility of radon in the water these parameters are considered to be important the 222rn emitted with co2 gases varies from 1420 to 7216 bq m3 whereas in springs with primarily ch4 gas 300 bq m3 table 1 soil 222rn concentrations are within both the areas vary from 66 to 200 bq m3 which means that clay sediments near the surface cap the degasation area it is observed that maximum rn flux is being associated with wells where co2 flux predominates over ch4 in other words it is typical for the sakhalin island that ch4 rich mineral groundwater does not reflect high 222rn emanations it could be suggested that radon is carried to the surface by co2 richon et al 2011 girault et al 2014 the increase in rn concentration and temperature may be a result of the increase in the diffusion rate and temperature singh et al 1988 sharma et al 2000 it is illustrated in the lesogorski thermal field 13 where the radon concentration in soil gas reaches 100 bq m3 the area of the volchansky high pco2 spring is characterized by the lowest soil radon concentration of 32 51 bq m3 such low radon concentration most likely correlates with geological conditions of the area since a clay layer cover it is well known that many factors that affect the formation and the movement of rn in the ground the uranium content grain size and permeability of the host rock and the nature and extent of fracturing in the host rock otton 1992 are the functions of a rock type we assume that an important factor affecting the amount of radon in the groundwater in the sinegorski spa and the volchansky spring is the associated gas composition the consequently obtained data show an ambient level of the rn concentrations for the sinegorsky high pco2 mineral waters 11 from 3950 to 4900 bq m3 the emanations from the well of the volchansky spring 12 are higher varying from 5833 to 7216 bq m3 the lesogorsky thermal spring 13 has the lowest concentration of radon from 16 to 133 bq m3 the difference between the nature of radon concentrations in soil and water may occur due to the difference in the radon source and the geological conditions of the hypergenetic zone 5 conclusions this study results groundwater chemistry of the sakhalin island characterizes the general evolution of groundwater mud volcanoes fluids and associated gases provides data for future studies involving the chemical evolution of groundwater on the island the studied underground fluids belong to three main water types na hco3 cl alkali carbonate waters na cl hco3 highly evolved saline and na cl mature groundwaters chemical evolution of groundwater on sakhalin island demonstrated cation exchange and salinization as dominant evolutionary pathways cation exchange ca changing for na is identified as a dominant geochemical process during the evolution of groundwater it is suggested that groundwater flow through fractured mudstone sandstone units may cause cation exchange for na hco3 cl and na cl hco3 waters mature groundwaters characterized by higher concentrations of chloride result from mixing between the na rich groundwater and saline groundwater at depth associated with either modern seawater or connate relict seawater isotopic signatures of groundwaters vary from meteoric to metamorphic origin these metamorphic waters consisting of water hydrated from clay and seawater are traced in fluids of yuzhno sakhalin mud volcano despite modification by mixing with meteoric waters and water rock interaction processes whereas fault systems that define the areas of highly mineralized water circulation appear to play a major role in the co2 migration to the surface as well as ch4 generation the isotopic data indicate that co2 in the mineral water may be mantle derived and its presence is critical for the creation of the high pco2 groundwater on the other hand isotope signature of methane indicates its various origin specified by tectonics the methane manifestation in the south of the sakhalin island is mainly related to thermogenic reservoirs because they are more often dislocated by tectonics and crossed by active and permeable faults the sources of biogenous methane in the north of the sakhalin island are related to younger and shallower reservoirs and less affected by tectonic processes the 222rn observations provided for the first time have allowed us to associate radon flux with high pco2 waters it could be suggested that radon is carried to the surface by co2 acknowledgements we are grateful to dr r v zharkov for supporting fieldwork this work was supported by grants from russian

stable isotopes genesis high pco2 waters 222rn sakhalin island 1 introduction the present study describes geochemistry of main mineral water manifestations in the sakhalin the largest russian island the mineral water resources of the sakhalin are known since the 18th century but first significant regional investigations were carried in 1951 aver ev 1957 ivanov and nevraev 1964 chapovskiy and ravdonikas 1972 for the last 15 years investigations were focused on the origin of the ch4 gas phase in low temperature thermal waters with no data on the minor and trace elements astakhov et al 2002 obzhirov et al 2002 shakirov et al 2004 shakirov and syrbu 2012 the first attempt to elucidate the genesis of cold mineral waters and mud volcanoes fluids on sakhalin island has been made in the recent years chelnokov et al 2015a b preliminary results have shown that the mineral waters and associated gases not only indicate geochemical processes but also represent the earthquake preparation markers chelnokov et al 2015a b it should be noted that the sakhalin island is considered to be the most seismically active region of russia despite the vast literature and numerous studies of rn geochemistry reported for various regions in the world the behavior of rn in the groundwater systems of the sakhalin had never been studied the geological structures of the sakhalin island are formed as a result of mountain formation process activation folding faulting volcanism and other geodynamic processes during the alpine folding epoch the position of sakhalin island astride the eurasian and north american plates e g nokleberg et al 2005 a broad range of tectonic settings and deformation fronts had developed through time the geological development of the fold system is well defined in the geochemical and hydrogeochemical processes occurring in their depths multiple manifestations of thermal and mineral waters of different composition oil and gas deposits indicate these processes on the territory of sakhalin island and its shelf as well the primary goal of this work was to investigate the geochemistry of waters and associated gases and overview of the role of tectonic setting in their origin and distribution from the global perspective the significance of this study relates to the ability to use the geochemical data from mineral springs as a short term earthquake precursors this paper also describes important issues of the crustal radiogenic gases generation and the overall radiation safety from rn presented findings provide new hydrogeochemical information for the sakhalin island which was previously available only scarcely 2 geological and geomorphological setting more than twenty mineral spring and four mud volcanoes are known at sakhalin island fig 1 chapovskiy and ravdonikas 1972 nearly 90 of the spring systems are cold while others are thermal with discharge temperature less than 50 c many manifestations of cold mineral water do not discharge as springs 7 8 11 18 19 20 on fig 1 the upflows were discovered during drilling of wells for domestic use or industrial exploration of coal oil or gas only several mineral springs 13 14 21 are used for spa treatment chelnokova 2006 but in general they are not actively developed the geological and topographic characteristics of the sakhalin island are closely related to the plate interaction processes which are specified by dislocation on the boundary of the okhotsk and amurian plate e g zonenshain et al 1990 maruyama et al 1997 biebow et al 2000 rodnikov et al 2001 voeikova et al 2007 however in recent years the sakhalin structure was interpreted as the boundary between the mesozoic plates with different versions of the boundary properly being drawn along the west and central sakhalin regional faults wei and seno 1998 trifonov and kozhurin 2010 prytkov et al 2012 the sakhalin island is owed to the sakhalin hokkaido orogenic belt and is characterized by well defined tectonic zonality fully represented on the hokkaido island japan and reflecting the successive accumulation of continental crust from the middle jurassic to neogene e g niida and kito 1986 kiminami et al 1992 dobretsov et al 1994 isozaki 1996 grannik 2005 golozoubov 2006 jahn et al 2016 the oldest rocks are paleozoic ophiolites and associated sedimentary rocks which may have got their origin in the breakup of the proterozoic supercontinent maruyama et al 1997 however the majority of the basement consists of jurassic to paleogene rocks taira et al 1989 cenozoic granitoids of hokkaido and sakhalin have remarkably similar chemical and isotopic characteristics suggesting that the granitoids have been generated by melting of sources with mixed lithologies including subducted accretionary complexes and probably some hidden older basement rocks jahn et al 2016 paleogene strata overlie the nappes and the folded structures are cut by intrusions of biotitic granites and granodiorites with an isotopic age of 58 66 ma zonenshain et al 1990 most mineral spring systems 9 10 12 13 15 20 are distributed within the west sakhalin uplift fig 1 between two main tectonic dislocations of the island west sakhalin i and central sakhalin ii faults systems these boundaries might be responsible for many strong earthquakes that have occurred in the sea of japan as well as on the sakhalin island the west sakhalin anticlinoria overstretching over 650 km from the south to the north of the island was formed in the miocene 15 ma it is considered to be an evolution equivalent of the sorach ezo orogenic belt on the hokkaido island japan arita 1999 grannik 2005 the structural denudation landscape is typical for the west sakhalin mountains the absolute heights vary between 300 m and 1300 m the tectonic uplift is initially responsible for the deep river incision a decline in the sea level of 110 130 m which has occurred during the pleistocene climatic minimum of 18 20 ka bp korotky 1997 the east sakhalin uplift is composed of actively dislocated metamorphic pre cretaceous rocks hidaka belt this is due to the tectonic uplift of the basement rocks that have occurred during the collision with the kuril forearc taira 2001 there is no data relating to mineral springs located in this part of the sakhalin island and no samples have been obtained the central sakhalin graben is identified as jurassic subduction zone grannik 2005 separating the west sakhalin and the east sakhalin uplifts the kamuikotan belt on the hokkaido island is its equivalent which is determined as a high p t

the grabens the largest of which is the tym poronay lowland the aniva depression is located in the south of the island it is graben with the thickness of cenozoic sediments up to 4 5 km the susunai ridge uplift is the east boundary of the depression and is represented by slivers of the cretaceous tertiary accretionary prisms idonnappu and hidaka belts fig 1 central sakhalin thrust and nappes fault are a border between aniva depression and the west sakhalin uplift on the west the most fascinated mineral waters and mud volcanoes on the island are distributed within this contact 1 7 8 11 18 on fig 1 the low hills and plains of the northern sakhalin are composed of gently inclined and folded neogene strata and are shaped by abrasion and denudation the depressions located in its central part are filled with unconsolidated quaternary alluvial sediments the marine depositional plains occupy coastal areas the western coast is represented with cliffs reaching 8 10 m height in the north and 60 80 m in the south the low temperature thermal waters manifestations are connected with oil gas condensate fields on the shelf the continuing uplift of the island results in high seismic activity with earthquakes reaching 8 points on the richter scale tanaka and nozawa 1977 the shallow seismicity of sakhalin island is traditionally attributed to its main meridional thrust faults tikhonov and lomtev 2014 based on gps observations the island is moving westward at the rate of from 2 5 mm yr in the north to 7 6 mm yr in the south over the entire extent of the island the dominating deformations are those of sub latitudinal compression accompanied by right lateral strike slip shestakov et al 2011 the heat flow distribution calculated by the 3 d model tanaka et al 2004 has marked that the south of the sakhalin island relates to the backarc zone of low surface heat flow in summary mineral waters of the sakhalin island discharge over a wide range of geological settings including continental back arc rifting in the west sakhalinian uplift an ancient accretionary prism in the south and sedimentary basins in the north 3 sampling and analytical techniques the

using electrolytic enrichment and subsequent measurement of counting rates details of sample preparation for 3h analysis are described by goriachev 1997 the standard deviation was 0 3 1 1 tu depending on the 3h concentration the program of radon monitoring at the sinegorsky high pco2 spa was initiated in june 2014 as a part of the present investigation the continuous soil rn monitoring was carried out using a seismic radon station srs 05 lukianov et al 2014 http ntm ru products 133 7282 soil radon rn was measured continuously at 20 min interval using alpha particle detectors the measuring range of 222 rn volumetric activity varied from 20 to 50000 bq m3 and for 216po tha from 0 to 999 decays an advantage of the probe was claimed to have an ability to measure the temperature barometric pressure and moisture at the same time the accuracy of measurement of rn was 30 at all full scale range the physical parameters such as temperature pressure water level and conductivity were measured

this study sample locations are indicated on fig 1 summary is given in table 1 4 1 water chemistry the chemical composition of studied waters is listed in table 1 and on the piper diagram fig 2 which demonstrates the proportions between the water components river waters are represented by cations and anion mixed types na hco3 na ca hco3 na cl hco3 na ca cl hco3 the typical total dissolved solids concentration for river waters is 0 1 0 2 g l highest tds 0 26 1 0 g l cl na br and b concentrations are specific for water samples from the estuarine parts of the rivers nelbutta hankotan or waters exposed to deep fluids volchansky creek piper divided groundwaters into two major groups i alkali carbonate na hco3 cl na ca hco3 groundwaters and ii saline groundwaters of na cl and na cl hco3 types the majority of the groundwaters from the first group 7 8 9 10 are characterized by mineralization less than 0 6 g l the ph varies from 6 5 to 9 1 and redox potential from 224 to 160 mv the hco3 cl ratios 1 8 9 4 correspond to hco3 rich mineral waters where na and ca are dominating cations br and b are presented in concentrations 0 01 1 2 mg l and 0 2 0 8 mg l respectively waters have a good correlation between hco3 and tds r 0 73 tds and cl r 0 83 na and cl r 0 91 springs from the sw coast of the island indicate elevated concentrations of so4 and have a strong smell of h2s 9 10 table 1 the maximum h2s concentration in the gases is 1 1 in cold mineral springs with shallow geochemical characteristics 9 10 here h2s aqueous is transformed to 2h so4 2 through oxidation of h2s in the vadose zone e g white 1957 it could also be associated with sulfur bearing bacteria below the water surface suggesting biogenically mediated so4 reduction reyes et al 2010 the second group groundwaters are generally cold t 8 11 c except to springs on the n ne of the island 13 14 21 table 1 with temperatures 35 50 c tds changes significantly from 0 4 to 21 3 g l up to 26 g l in mud volcanoes fluid the ph changes from 6 3 to 9 2 the eh values indicate reducing conditions 315 to 60 mv the na dominates as cation species ranging from 120 to 7000 mg l the molar na cl ratios vary from 0 8 to 1 7 the concentrations of alkali metals so4 si fe mn and trace elements i ba b br are very high table 1 local enrichments also occur in relatively immobile elements such as as and sr while values of al could be compared with other analyzed water types whereas f concentrations in this group are the lowest and even less than the detection limit the si contents of the spring waters are less than 50 mg l suggesting that they have not been heated to over 100 c saline groundwaters can be subdivided by hco3 cl ratios into two genetic groups na cl mature waters with ratio values less than 0 5 and na cl hco3 highly evolved waters with ratio values varying from 0 5 to 1 50 fig 2 4 2 fate of chemical heterogeneity the analyzed groundwaters are characterized by an heterogeneous chemical composition there are three major natural processes in addition to chemical reactions such as oxidation reduction reactions that commonly contribute to the observed chemistry of groundwaters simple mixing cation exchange and dissolution of minerals in order to explore the mechanism of salinity the plot of na versus cl is widely used magaritz et al 1981 dixon and chiswell 1992 the concentration of cl is well correlated with na for all studied waters suggesting that the dissolution of halite may be the major source of na and cl theoretically the dissolution of halite will release equal amounts of na and cl into the solution nevertheless the results deviate from the anticipated 1 1 relationship fig 3 a alkali carbonate water and na cl hco3 mixed waters samples show higher concentrations of sodium than chlorine the molar na cl molar ratio varies from 1 06 to 4 73 with an average value of 2 12 a greater na cl ratio may be ascribed to the feldspar weathering and the dissolution of other na containing minerals herczeg and edmunds 2000 grasby et al 1999 alcalá and custodio 2008 the relatively high na concentration in the groundwater could also be a reflection of cation exchange between na and ca 2 or mg 2 the cl br mass ratios are presented in this paper the cl and br concentrations are highly correlated for all groundwaters spearman s rank correlation coefficient 0 96 for 31 samples mass ratios of cl to br range from 318 to 803 average 456 fig 3b for all saline groundwaters which is an indication of fresh water and nacl dissolution components rittenhouse 1967 contamination by saltwater intrusion evidently to be present locally on sakhalin island samples 18 19 20 and 21 appear to have characteristics of advanced saltwater intrusion the na cl molar ratios for 18 19 20 and 21 are very similar to that of the seawater na cl seawater ratio is 0 85 the slightly less ratios can be directly attributed to the fact that fresh groundwater mixes with seawater fig 3a demonstrates that na cl ratios of these groundwaters show a narrow scatter around the seawater line the cl br ratios also indicate potential saltwater intrusion however 18 19 20 and 21 have br concentrations of 21 6 12 1 6 6 and 8 8 mg l respectively these br concentrations are below the 67 mg l recorded for seawater because the overall mixture is diluted however the ratios of cl br are nearly the same 318 388 suggesting that relatively fresh groundwaters are mixing with seawater banks et al 1991 heinrich et al 1993 yardley et al 1993 meere and banks 1997 mccaig et al 2000 because seawater is present at depth beneath island it is difficult to say if this is connate seawater or modern seawater the dynamics of this system are not fully understood but are be the focus of ongoing research regardless of the age of the saline water at depth the chemistry of the groundwater indicates mixing with seawater furthermore the observed distribution of dissolved constituents in groundwater such as i and b may be linked to the complex geological history and may associate with old seawater incursion allen and matsuo 2002 the large concentrations of iodine 0 3 14 0 mg l in saline waters are explained by the high organic enrichment as a result of diagenesis and consolidation iodine is transferred from the sediment to the pore fluid this process is facilitated by the elevated temperatures 32 40 c in the deeper layers shishkina 1969 mineral saturation indices may provide insight into the nature of chemical processes thatcontrol solute concentrations in groundwaters saturation indices si in groundwaters have been calculated for minerals commonly observed in the marine sediments the computer code phreeqc plummer et al 1991 was utilized for these calculations fig 4 a indicates the calculated values of si for calcite and dolomite for all groundwater samples as variable showing both undersaturation and supersaturation with respect to the carbonates it is noticeable that na cl hco3 saline water 11 and mud volcanos fluids 16 17 are more saturated with respect to dolomite than with calcite the explanation could be as following 1 incongruent dissolution of dolomite 2 preferential precipitation of dolomite with respect to calcite 3 preferential exchange of ca 2 for mg 2 in cation exchange reactions with clay minerals drever 1982 there is no evidence for present carbonate layers within the stratigraphic section and no travertine within water discharge but well studied all of the world mud volcanoes fluid support suggestion of cation exchange reactions with clay minerals lavrushin 2012 this process is known as base exchange softening providing that there is a reservoir of sodium ions adsorbed onto clay minerals calcium and or magnesium ions in the water will preferentially attach to the exchange sites and the sodium will be ejected and transferred into the water elevated phs i e lower h concentrations large surface areas and long residence times favor the cation exchange process stumm and morgan 1996 increased na concentration coupled with decreased ca 2 and mg 2 concentrations are also indicative of cation exchange henderson 1984 the elevated levels of boron in groundwaters from this group can be also explained by the base exchange softening process other types of waters are in equilibrium or undersaturated relative to carbonates sicalcite 0 09 0 1 sidolomite 2 0 07 all groundwater samples are under saturated with respect to halite thus proving the conservative nature not getting easily oversaturated of sodium and chloride fig 4b thermodynamic calculations indicate that all saline groundwaters are oversaturated relative to the primary aluminosilicate minerals sialbite 1 2 2 8 quarts siquartz 0 4 1 2 and hydroxides sihematite 9 2 17 4 3 isotopic composition of waters the δh and δ18o studied fluids contents are shown in fig 3 and reported in table 1 these data indicate that meteoric precipitation is the common source of na ca hco3 surface water fig 5 b deuterium excess value is higher than 7 up to 16 1 that corresponds to present day precipitation over the region chelnokov et al 2013 kharitonova et al 2013 the tritium value for surface waters of the sakhalin island varies from 6 5 to 8 3 tu the data can be used as a reference number for the preliminary estimation of the residence time for the groundwaters the na hco3 cl groundwaters are different from the surface waters with varying d excess from 11 9 to 9 1 and a range of tritium from 1 to 11 tu only one sample of the groundwater from borehole 8 8 in table 1 showed 2h 18o and 3h enrichment the chemical and the isotopic influence for this shallow well can be explained by its location on the active part of the central sakhalin fault within the area of the sinegorsky spa for the antonovsky spring 10 the content of 3h 7 1 tu which makes it comparable to the surface water whereas the nevelsky spring 9 and water from boreholes 7 8 have lower tritium content 1 0 2 0 tu these isotopic features suggest mixing between the recent recharge and an older component the isotopic composition of na cl hco3 and na cl saline groundwater is variable the typical and the most evident geothermal 18o shift has been detected in the sinegorsky area of the cold pco2 waters d excess 39 to 64 fig 5a these values are related to isotopes of the yuzhno sakhalinsky mud volcano fluid seletsky 1992 chelnokov et al 2015a b and lay within the range of values for arc type magmatic water giggenbach 1992 or for waters derived from dehydration of marine clays in pore waters expelled during sediment compaction at temperatures of up to 200 c seletsky 1978 giggenbach 1995 lavrushin et al 1996 dahlmann de lange 2003 thus the proportion of clay water of hydration in the jurassic accretionary prism waters 11 is roughly 20 40 also 3h concentrations are below the detection limit indicating a mean transit time greater than 60 years only one well from this site showed the presence of tritium 2 1 tu the presence 3h in these deep aquifers is caused by either leakage from other aquifers or contamination as a result of the exploitation casing column problem the cl rich waters of amursky and aniva wells 19 20 fig 5b have a slight 18o enrichment less than 20 of which is most likely derived from the clay water of hydration besides high resolution tritium analyses show very low but measurable levels of tritium in all samples of the deep na cl waters located on the southwest of sakhalin island that also could be evidence of seawater intrusion or mixing processes in contrast the high pco2 na cl hco3 waters of the volchansky spa 12 located in the middle part of the island lie close to the gmwl fig 5a and have 3h content compared with surface waters table 1 deuterium excess 0 3 8 5 which is less than in meteoric water indicates mixing of the recent recharge and deep water thermal waters in the north 13 14 21 are the most depleted by the isotopes among all studied waters but tritium contents for these samples are slightly above the detection limit table 1 these isotopic features suggest that thermal waters result from a mixture between the recent recharge and an older component recharge under cold climatic conditions 4 4 chemical and isotopic composition of gases the components of associated gases from the studied fluids are presented in table 2 carbon dioxide and methane are the main components of the gases in the springs and mud volcanoes fluids methane is very abundant 70 vol in the gas phase associated with the thermal springs 13 14 21 n2 and o2 are less than 28 vol and 1 6 vol respectively the maximum h2s concentration in the gases is 1 1 in cold mineral springs with shallow geochemical characteristics 9 10 helium content varies with the full range of the first tens of ppm in the thermal areas and mud volcanoes to hundreds of ppm in high pco2 waters it should be noted that mineral springs with similar isotopic water and gas characteristics were discovered and studied in papua new guinea baylis et al 1996 the current data on inert gases ar he and their isotopes are limited the available data lavrushin 2012 allowed us to suppose the major sources of gas components for studied mineral springs the he ar ratios indicate that gases are associated with the jurassic accretionary prism waters 11 18 and the yuzhno sakhalinsky mud volcano 16 are rich with magmatic basaltic component he ar ratio 0 2 0 5 vs 0 001 in the meteoric component giggenbach 1992 whereas gases from the east sakhalin uplift 12 have lower he ar ratio 0 07 the data from thermal springs indicate that gases originate mainly from air dissolved in meteoric water descending to the reservoir rather than contributed by magmatic gas from the deeper part of the reservoir he ar 0 02 0 03 he isotopic ratio 3he 4he in the mid ocean ridge basalt morb which represents a mean upper mantle value varies around 1 10 5 ozima and podosek 2002 the mantle and atmospheric value 3he 4he 1 3 1 4 10 6 that is much higher than typical crustal rock 3he 4he production ratios 1 10 8 andrews 1985 the 3he 4he ratios available for the sakhalin island lavrushin et al 1996 suggest that gases associated with thermal springs 13 14 21 3he 4he 2 9 2 7 10 7 and volchansky high pco2 area 12 3he 4he 9 10 7 are derived from the crust whereas he derived within the central sakhalin fault 3he 4he 4 4 10 6 11 16 18 and 3he 4he 3 2 10 6 17 has a typical mantle derived helium signature which is close to the 3he 4he ratios of circum pacific volcanic gases poreda and craig 1989 sano and wakita 1985 as a result at least two different sources of he flux exist within the mineral springs of the sakhalin island 1 mantle he flux through the central sakhalin fault system to the south of the island and 2 crustal he produced in the geological formations the isotopic investigations of associated gases have been conducted for fluids located within the south part of central sakhalin fault 11 16 18 and the thermal springs 13 14 21 table 2 carbon isotopic properties are commonly used to classify natural gases colombo et al 1965 stahl 1973 schoell 1980 1983 the values of δ13cpdb for co2 of the sinegorsky spa waters 11 18 vary from 6 to 30 0 depending on the primary associated gas co2 or ch4 table 2 it suggests the presence of a deep seated mantle co2 origin 4 to 8 whiticar et al 1994 if for high pco2 waters it is typical in contrast to waters where volumes of associated gases co2 and ch4 are equal to the range of δ13c co2 values of fossil fuels is wide the reason is the complicated biogeochemical processes that are involved in the degradation of the organic matter into natural gas liquid petroleum and coal values δ13c co2 for coals lie between 18 and 30 degens and ross 1969 consequently δ13c co2 value 30 0 could point out on degassing zones where co2 originates from the coal bearing beds shakirov and syrbu 2012 it should be noted that an abandoned coal mine is located 10 km nw from the sinegorsky spa the obtained values of δ13c ch4 for the sinegorsky high pco2 mineral water vary from 30 7 to 27 5 namely δ13c signature of the ch4 emitted from the marine sediments indicates its thermogenic origin to examine this conclusion we have measured a δd ch4 content in contrast to the δ13c properties the δd properties of methane do not appear to show an apparent thermal maturity dependency schoell 1980 whiticar et al 1994 hydrogen isotopic properties provide details on the depositional environment and formation pathways such as microbial reduction of co2 or acetate fermentation whiticar et al 1994 the derived value 84 2 is too high for the marine or terrestrial microbial methane and it indicates the thermogenic methane is formed by the heat induced decay of the organic matter whiticar et al 1994 the yuzhno sakhalinsky mv has very similar isotopic characteristics with sinegorsky high pco2 waters data on fig 6 a and b show thermogenic characteristics with a migration trend to a mixing zone the data for the pugachev mv indicate another gas genesis the genetic characterization of the gas by variation in δd and δ13c in methane schoell 1983 shows that it is a mixture of the bacterial gas derived from continental environments and the oil associated thermogenic gas fig 6a in fact the value of δd ch4 264 corresponds to methane produced by fermentation processes in the fresh water environments 250 to 400 smow woltemate et al 1984 and the bernard diagram fig 6b supports a biogenic origin of methane from the pugachev mv the volume of δ13c co2 also indicates biogeochemical processes that are involved in the degradation of the organic matter table 2 the data δd ch4 are unavailable for thermal springs 13 14 21 of the island but the substantial depletion of the δ13c indicates a biogenic origin probably with some thermogenic component shakirov and syrbu 2012 the biogenic classification of the hydrocarbons is clearly illustrated in diagram suggested by bernard bernard et al 1976 fig 6b biogenic methane originates by two major pathways i co2 reduction and ii acetate type fermentation the co2 reduction is dominant in marine sediments as the precursor acetate is oxidized to co2 in the sulfate reducing zone whiticar and faber 1985 in the natural environment the methane generated by co2 reduction tends to be more depleted in 13c 60 than that formed by acetate type fermentation 13c 60 the methane δ13c measured for dagi hot springs is expected for methanogenesis by co2 reduction from the other side world terrestrial mud volcano investigations etiope et al 2009 demonstrate that the d13c data between 60 and 50 could be false biogenic and due to molecular fractionation of the mixed gas the most isotopically heavy 13c ch4 and light 13c co2 among studied thermal waters have been retrieved from the lesogorsky thermal spring 13 it could be explained by partial biogenic methane oxidizing to co2 in upper oxygen reach sedimentary zones e g ch4 2o2 co2 2h2o or 2ch4 o2 3 76 n2 2co 4h2 3 76 n2 as a result this reactions δ13c of co2 are expected to be isotopically light 4 5 radon anomalies a groundwater radon monitoring of mineral springs of the sakhalin island has been carried out to investigate the correlation between radon anomalies and the seismic activity of the region many of the springs have high rn contents which are also related to the seismic activity chelnokov et al 2016 radon is considered to be a significant tectonic activity precursor due to its limited informational content caused by a relatively short half life period of 3 82 days since temperature and conductivity of water can control the solubility of radon in the water these parameters are considered to be important the 222rn emitted with co2 gases varies from 1420 to 7216 bq m3 whereas in springs with primarily ch4 gas 300 bq m3 table 1 soil 222rn concentrations are within both the areas vary from 66 to 200 bq m3 which means that clay sediments near the surface cap the degasation area it is observed that maximum rn flux is being associated with wells where co2 flux predominates over ch4 in other words it is typical for the sakhalin island that ch4 rich mineral groundwater does not reflect high 222rn emanations it could be suggested that radon is carried to the surface by co2 richon et al 2011 girault et al 2014 the increase in rn concentration and temperature may be a result of the increase in the diffusion rate and temperature singh et al 1988 sharma et al 2000 it is illustrated in the lesogorski thermal field 13 where the radon concentration in soil gas reaches 100 bq m3 the area of the volchansky high pco2 spring is characterized by the lowest soil radon concentration of 32 51 bq m3 such low radon concentration most likely correlates with geological conditions of the area since a clay layer cover it is well known that many factors that affect the formation and the movement of rn in the ground the uranium content grain size and permeability of the host rock and the nature and extent of fracturing in the host rock otton 1992 are the functions of a rock type we assume that an important factor affecting the amount of radon in the groundwater in the sinegorski spa and the volchansky spring is the associated gas composition the consequently obtained data show an ambient level of the rn concentrations for the sinegorsky high pco2 mineral waters 11 from 3950 to 4900 bq m3 the emanations from the well of the volchansky spring 12 are higher varying from 5833 to 7216 bq m3 the lesogorsky thermal spring 13 has the lowest concentration of radon from 16 to 133 bq m3 the difference between the nature of radon concentrations in soil and water may occur due to the difference in the radon source and the geological conditions of the hypergenetic zone 5 conclusions this study results groundwater chemistry of the sakhalin island characterizes the general evolution of groundwater mud volcanoes fluids and associated gases provides data for future studies involving the chemical evolution of groundwater on the island the studied underground fluids belong to three main water types na hco3 cl alkali carbonate waters na cl hco3 highly evolved saline and na cl mature groundwaters chemical evolution of groundwater on sakhalin island demonstrated cation exchange and salinization as dominant evolutionary pathways cation exchange ca changing for na is identified as a dominant geochemical process during the evolution of groundwater it is suggested that groundwater flow through fractured mudstone sandstone units may cause cation exchange for na hco3 cl and na cl hco3 waters mature groundwaters characterized by higher concentrations of chloride result from mixing between the na rich groundwater and saline groundwater at depth associated with either modern seawater or connate relict seawater isotopic signatures of groundwaters vary from meteoric to metamorphic origin these metamorphic waters consisting of water hydrated from clay and seawater are traced in fluids of yuzhno sakhalin mud volcano despite modification by mixing with meteoric waters and water rock interaction processes whereas fault systems that define the areas of highly mineralized water circulation appear to play a major role in the co2 migration to the surface as well as ch4 generation the isotopic data indicate that co2 in the mineral water may be mantle derived and its presence is critical for the creation of the high pco2 groundwater on the other hand isotope signature of methane indicates its various origin specified by tectonics the methane manifestation in the south of the sakhalin island is mainly related to thermogenic reservoirs because they are more often dislocated by tectonics and crossed by active and permeable faults the sources of biogenous methane in the north of the sakhalin island are related to younger and shallower reservoirs and less affected by tectonic processes the 222rn observations provided for the first time have allowed us to associate radon flux with high pco2 waters it could be suggested that radon is carried to the surface by co2 acknowledgements we are grateful to dr r v zharkov for supporting fieldwork this work was supported by grants from russian

7429,it is well established that seismic waves traveling through porous media stimulate fluid flow and accelerate particle transport however the mechanism remains poorly understood to quantify the coupling effect of hydrodynamic force transportation distance and ultrasonic stimulation on particle transport and fate in porous media laboratory experiments were conducted using custom built ultrasonic controlled soil column equipment three column lengths 23 cm 33 cm and 43 cm were selected to examine the influence of transportation distance transport experiments were performed with 0 w 600 w 1000 w 1400 w and 1800 w of applied ultrasound and flow rates of 0 065 cm s 0 130 cm s and 0 195 cm s to establish the roles of ultrasonic stimulation and hydrodynamic force the laboratory results suggest that whilst ultrasonic stimulation does inhibit suspended particle deposition and accelerate deposited particle release both hydrodynamic force and transportation distance are the principal controlling factors the median particle diameter for the peak concentration was approximately 50 of that retained in the soil column simulated particle breakthrough curves using extended traditional filtration theory effectively described the experimental curves particularly the curves that exhibited a higher tailing concentration keywords ultrasonic stimulation hydrodynamic force transportation distance transport and fate particle effluent curve soil column 1 introduction seismic waves cause changes in the hydrological properties of earth materials far from their causative earthquakes pride et al 2004 zheng et al 2017 for example the sumatra andaman earthquake in 2004 created water level changes with a spike and step rise pattern in fairbanks alaska sil and freymueller 2006 the lushan earthquake in 2013 induced large hydrological changes in the region and these observations were attributed to the coseismic strain and permeability changes shi et al 2014 a well near parkfield california has experienced monotonic and persistent water level rises caused by the seismic waves of local and distant earthquakes roeloffs 1998 the chi chi earthquake in taiwan caused increased pore pressure in alluvial fans which induced landslides on gentle slopes wang et al 2001 a growing body of evidence suggests that many of these hydrological changes can be attributed to the effect of seismic waves on dislodged clogged particles and the enlargement of micro cracks candela et al 2014 furthermore seismic waves in the subsurface undergo attenuation and dispersion within wide ranges of frequencies and scales consequently inducing particle movement and fluid flow in the subsurface which is usually considered to be important at ultrasonic frequencies candela et al 2015 shi et al 2014 solazzi et al 2016 sun et al 2015 despite many experiments and theories related to particle transport in porous media the intrinsic mechanisms of particle transport and fate under ultrasonic stimulation remain poorly understood candela et al 2014 faoro et al 2012 liu and manga 2009 poesio and ooms 2004 brodsky et al 2003 suggested that temporary barriers deposited by groundwater flow are dislodged by the stronger flow caused by seismic waves and candela et al 2015 demonstrated that seismic waves cause a transient phenomenon of unclogging blockages from fractures poesio and ooms 2004 showed that the removal of fouling particles by acoustic waves increases as liquid flow rate decreases candela et al 2014 concluded that permeability enhancement and recovery rate are determined by a flow driven mechanism of particle transport the movement of fine particles by seismic or ultrasonic wave induced fluid flow indicates that flow rate is a potential key to predicting and controlling particle transport and fate in porous media however simply varying the power of wave stimulation cannot sufficiently evaluate this possibility additionally ultrasonic waves suffer energy loss by damping and attenuation a distant target subsurface may not receive sufficient wave energy for the removal of various wellbore plugging particles severely restricting large scale application avvaru et al 2017 moreover owing to difficulties when allowing for contact conditions of ultrasonic signals in production wells the design of ultrasonic treatment is mainly based on practical experience the effective zone of ultrasonic treatment has not yet been investigated serdyukov and kurlenya 2007 therefore understanding the effects of flow rate transport distance and ultrasonic power on particle transport in the porous medium is of great importance in principle particle transport and fate in porous media depends on various factors that generally fall into two categories straining and non straining particle straining is where particles are retained in pore throats that are too small to allow the particles to pass through it is controlled solely by particle size and pore construction ahfir et al 2017 díaz et al 2010 for particles with smaller diameters than the pore throat non straining which depends on particle flow particle porous media and particle particle interactions including electrostatic force diffusion multi particle bridging surface deposition interception inertia and hydrodynamic force play a decisive role in transport sen and khilar 2006 zamani and maini 2009 it is generally accepted that diffusion results from the random brownian motion of water molecules it is dominant for particles with diameters of 1 μm interception can be incorporated as a boundary condition for attachment from sedimentation and diffusion inertia is only important under air conditions and is negligible for water conditions the chemical factors that influence particle transportation can be isolated by flowing deionized water overall particle transport and fate in porous media are complex multi phase processes and previous studies have not identified a specific key variable that can be used to assess particle transport in natural settings the objective of this study was to systematically investigate the influence of flow rate transport distance and ultrasonic power on particle transport and fate in porous media 2 experimental procedure laboratory experiments were performed using custom built ultrasonic controlled soil column equipment which can apply up to 1800 w of axial ultrasonic stimulation and confining pressure to a cylindrical soil column fig 1 the soil column was 6 5 cm in diameter and its height could be adjusted from 20 to 80 cm the soil column was equipped with an ultrasonic emission head at the top and two special perspex filters at the top and bottom the special perspex filters were manufactured with one surface characterized by evenly distributed 0 5 mm diameter holes and the other surface had either an inlet or an outlet hole of 15 mm diameter the special perspex filters were used to maintain uniform flow into and out of the soil column a peristaltic pump longerpump bt600 2j baoding china was employed to pump particle suspensions or deionized water downward through the vertical soil column at rates ranging from 0 05 to 0 30 cm s measured by a flow meter leierda lzb 25 wenzhou china a turbidity meter hach 2100n loveland usa placed at the outlet of the soil column measured the effluent turbidity the measurement accuracy of the turbidity meter was 2 of reading plus 0 01 turbidity ntu by measuring the turbidity of several suspensions with known particle concentrations the following equation between concentration and turbidity level was obtained and through this equation the particle concentration was calculated 1 y 0 000008 x 2 0 012 x 0 0009 where y is the particle concentration m l3 and x refers to the turbidity level ntu the particle size distribution was recorded using a laser size distribution instrument bettersize 2000 dandong china the measurement accuracy and repeatability of the laser size distribution instrument were 0 5 the equipment maintains a constant chamber temperature using a digital temperature controller rkc instrument inc tokyo japan with a precision of 0 5 c and a sampling time of 0 25 s all laboratory experiments were implemented at a chamber temperature of 22 c 24 c the experimental equipment used in this study is described in detail in chen et al 2016 crushed quartz sand yufan inc shijiazhuang china was employed for the experiments after being treated with diluted h2so4 to remove any possible contaminants the diameter of the sand ranged from 1 0 to 3 2 mm and the coefficient of curvature c c d 30 2 d 10 d 60 and uniformity index c u d 60 d 10 were 1 10 and 1 43 respectively synthetic spherical sio2 particles winroc inc wenzhou china were employed as injected particles the injected particles had a median size of 11 85 μm with a standard deviation of 9 47 skewness of 0 30 and kurtosis of 0 92 the sio2 particle density was 2 26 g cm3 and the specific surface area was 1886 4 cm2 g 1 the concentration of the injected particle suspension was 1 mg ml our primary target was to investigate the most likely mechanisms of particle transport and fate under ultrasonic stimulation thus the injected particles and sand were selected to minimize permeability reduction in all experiments each soil column was 6 5 cm in diameter and either 23 33 or 43 cm in height for each column length the soil column was compacted with 3 cm of sand in each layer after each addition of sand the resulting layer was lightly blended with the layer below and then vibrated to avoid settlement or layer separation and to simulate uniform conditions in the soil column during the column compaction the level of deionized water which was air free was always maintained above the sand surface to remove any trapped air in the pores and produce conditions of saturation in the soil column the density of the saturated soil column was 1 99 g cm3 and the total porosity calculated from the volumetric ratio between the solid phase and the entire column was 40 3 the densities and porosities of all soil columns in our study were the same three column lengths 23 cm 33 cm and 43 cm were selected to examine the influence of transportation distance for each column length five ultrasonic powers 0 w 600 w 1000 w 1400 w and 1800 w and three flow rates 0 065 cm s 0 130 cm s and 0 195 cm s were applied to investigate the role of ultrasonic stimulation and hydrodynamic force thus a total of 45 experiments were performed during each experiment step injections of the particle suspension concentration of 1 mg ml and ultrasonic stimulation were carried out simultaneously for a specific length of time 0 065 cm s flow rate 120 s 0 130 cm s flow rate 60 s 0 195 cm s flow rate 40 s subsequently ultrasonic stimulation was stopped and a three way valve was employed to switch the pumped solution to deionized water until the turbidity level in the effluent approached 0 24 ntu i e the turbidity of deionized water these lengths of time were selected to provide each column with an approximately equal mass of particles 330 mg flow rates of particle suspensions and deionized water were same throughout each experiment following completion of each soil column experiment the size distribution of particles remaining in the soil column was measured the top emission head and special perspex filter were removed and soil from six different depths equally spaced throughout the length of the column was carefully excavated into 200 ml bottles the bottles were filled with deionized water and were slowly shaken for 1 h to liberate the retained particles the size distribution of the solution was recorded using the laser size distribution instrument in addition several effluents were collected for particle size analysis with the laser size distribution instrument around the peak of the breakthrough curve after each experiment all sand in the column was cleaned with deionized water until the turbidity declined to that of deionized water the sand was then dried at 105 c in preparation for the next experiment note that each turbidity level in the effluent was measured three times with the turbidity meter if the variations of the turbidity levels among the three measurements ranged within the deviation of the turbidity meter then the average turbidity level was treated as the final value each size distribution of the solution was re measured three times if the variation in the size distribution among the three measurements ranged within the accuracy of the size distribution instrument then the average size distribution was treated as the final value several soil column experiments were replicated under identical conditions and the results show good reproducibility 3 dlvo calculation particle transport and fate in porous media are simultaneously governed by many microscopic forces such as lift buoyancy gravity electrical double layer force hydrodynamic drag and london van der waals interactions to calculate the total interaction energy between the particles and the sand surface the derjaguin landau vervey overbeek dlvo theory was employed the formula of gregory 1981 was employed to calculate the london van der waals attractive contribution while the formula of hogg et al 1966 was employed to calculate the electrical double layer repulsion the electrophoretic mobility obtained using a zetasizer nano zs90 malvern instruments corporation worcestershire uk was employed to obtain the zeta potentials of the particles 41 mv whereas the zeta potential of the quartz sand 100 mv was obtained from published literature kuznar and elimelech 2007 the value of the hamaker constant was set to 1 5 10 19 j dlvo calculations indicate that the repulsive energy barrier and secondary minimum were approximately 2356 kt and 1 1 kt respectively where t is the temperature in degrees kelvin and k is the boltzmann constant these results indicate that the london van der waals attractive potential was negligible relative to electrical double layer repulsion moreover in our experiments the attachment to the solid water interface in the primary minimum was limited and the association between particles and sand surface in the secondary energy minimum was weak 4 mathematical model as only the particle deposition effect was considered in traditional filtration theory grolimund et al 1998 herzig et al 1970 the effect of particle release caused by the hydrodynamic force or ultrasonic stimulation could be included by extending traditional filtration theory the convection dispersion and deposition dynamic equations considering particle release can be established as follows 2 c t x t d 2 c t x x 2 u c t

is equal to the original step injection under the instantaneous injection condition the particle injection mode can be described as follows 9 g t m q δ t t 0 where m is the mass of injected particles

variable from the known values of two or more independent variables also called the predictors but it also can investigate how the variable fluctuates with changes in individual predictors in this study multiple linear regression models were used to predict the concentration peak time to concentration peak and concentration at 1 5 pv for a given set of independent variables length of column flow rate and ultrasonic power the regression model employed in this study has the following form 11 y j ε j β 1 j x 1 j β 2 j x 2 j β 3 j x 3 j where x 1 j x 2 j and x 3 j are predictors of the length of the column flow rate and ultrasonic power respectively yj is the predicted concentration peak time to concentration peak or concentration at 1 5 pv respectively β 1 j is the regression coefficient for each predictor and j is the intercept 6 results and discussion 6 1 results of the particle transportation experiments 6 1 1 impact of ultrasonic stimulation on particle transport relative particle concentration c c i in this study was the ratio between particle concentration in the effluent and the concentration of the injected particle suspension the value is dimensionless pv in this study refers to the ratio of the total volume of water passing through the soil column to the pore volume of the soil column time t replaced by pv dimensionless eliminates the effect of differences in pore volume and velocity in the soil column in experimental results in figs 2 4 a pv of zero corresponds to the initiation of particle suspension injection and ultrasonic stimulation the vertical dashed line intersecting the particle breakthrough curves indicates the end of particle suspension injection and of the ultrasonic stimulation in general the relative particle concentration increased from the beginning of injection and stimulation and reached a peak concentration after ceasing stimulation and particle suspension injection the relative particle concentration then gradually descended to a value of about 0 002 mg ml or 0 24 ntu equal to the turbidity of deionized water over the next several pv values fig 2a shows that the asymmetric shapes of the breakthrough curves for various ultrasonic powers were very similar but differs from those observed by ahfir et al 2009 who reported approximately symmetrical curves for instantaneous injection of particle suspension the asymmetric shapes of the particle breakthrough curve for the 0 w ultrasonic stimulation can be attributed to step injection which is a common method in actual engineering the asymmetric shapes of the particle breakthrough curves for the four ultrasonic stimulations also support this hypothesis furthermore a systematic increase in the concentration peak was observed with increasing ultrasonic power as the flow rate was constant throughout the experiment the hydrodynamic force cannot explain the observed effluent concentration curves the observations suggest that ultrasonic stimulation is the primary mechanism inhibiting suspended particle deposition and accelerating deposited particle release and transport in the porous media moreover the shapes of breakthrough curves at flow rates of 0 065 cm s fig 2a 0 130 cm s fig 2b and 0 195 cm s fig 2c were very similar differences in the transport behavior of particles under various ultrasonic powers decreased with increasing flow rate this is especially true for particle transport at a flow rate of 0 195 cm s the difference in peak concentrations between 0 w and 1800 w ultrasonic power was approximately 0 05 this suggests that the effect of ultrasonic stimulation on particle transport decreases with increasing hydrodynamic force as noted previously the dlvo theory suggests that deposition in the primary or secondary minimum is not expected in all experiments in the case where particle transport distance was only 23 cm particle removal was likely controlled mainly by hydrodynamic forces and ultrasonic stimulation these results provide substantial evidence that hydrodynamic force and ultrasonic stimulation are sufficient to remove particles and that minimal deposition occurs over this range of column lengths fig 3a shows the relative particle concentrations in effluent samples collected at a flow rate of 0 065 cm s for the 33 cm column without ultrasonic stimulation the effluent particle concentration quickly increased reaching a value of 0 08 and then plateaued during which concentration gradually increased to a peak of approximately 0 1 over the subsequent 0 5 pv the particle concentration then gradually dropped to a value of approximately 0 002 over the subsequent pv in comparison only single concentration peak was observed in fig 2a as the flow rate was constant throughout the experiment the step injection mode alone cannot explain the shape of the concentration peak four ultrasonic stimulations were applied and the corresponding plateau period also supports this hypothesis it is well known that particle deposition increases with longer transport distance ahfir et al 2009 and this was observed in the results of this study by comparing figs 3a and 2a all observations suggest that a gradual release of deposited particles caused by ultrasonic stimulation was the primary mechanism for the gradual increase in concentration during the plateau period in this case large volumes of particles were deposited in the longer column reflecting large volumes of deposited particles released this resulted in both the concentration plateau and also affected the concentration tailing however there were few particles deposited in the short column fig 2a reflecting fewer deposited particles released these affected only the concentration tailing for which the concentration was relatively lower than that of the concentration peak comparisons of the particle concentration curves for increasing ultrasonic stimulations reveal that the concentration peak and the duration of particle transport increased with increasing ultrasonic power this was especially true for post peak concentration curves concentration tailing the value and duration of post peak concentration increased with increasing ultrasonic power this suggests that the effect of ultrasonic stimulation on particle release and transport increases at higher ultrasonic powers all results provide substantial evidence that ultrasonic stimulation is an important mechanism for accelerating particle release and transport under low flow rate conditions fig 3b shows the relative particle concentrations of effluent samples collected from the 33 cm column at a flow rate of 0 130 cm s the shape of the breakthrough curve resembles a normal distribution curve and differs from the shape of the curve produced under the 0 065 cm s flow rate condition fig 3a the peak platform gradually disappeared in breakthrough curves at higher flow rates suggesting that a large hydrodynamic force inhibits particle deposition resulting in fewer deposited particles available for the ultrasonic stimulation comparison of the effluent concentration curves for particles transported in columns exposed to the range of ultrasonic stimulation also reveals a trend of larger peak concentrations with increasing ultrasonic power however the difference in peak effluent particle concentrations with ultrasonic stimulation was lower than that under the 0 065 cm s condition fig 3a this suggests that the acceleration of particle release and transport caused by ultrasonic stimulation decreases with increasing hydrodynamic force fig 3c shows the relative particle concentrations for effluent samples collected from the 33 cm column at a flow rate of 0 195 cm s the breakthrough curves for 0 w 600 w 1000 w and 1400 w are almost identical therefore changes in ultrasonic stimulation cannot explain the observed effluent concentration curves when the ultrasonic power was larger than 1400 w the peak value and tailing concentration increased with ultrasonic power in this case fewer particles can be deposited in the sand at a high flow rate and deposited particles can be removed only by strong ultrasonic simulation greater than 1400 w but not by a large hydrodynamic force these results indicate that ultrasonic simulation hydrodynamic force and transport distance are inextricably linked in controlling particle transport and fate in these columns fig 4 shows the relative particle concentration as a function of pv at flow rates of 0 065 cm s fig 4a 0 130 cm s fig 4b and 0 195 cm s fig 4c for a range of ultrasonic powers 0 1800 w in the 43 cm column fig 4a shows increasing peak concentrations with increased ultrasonic powers which decreased after 1400 w note that peak effluent concentration and the duration of particle transport increased with increasing ultrasonic power fig 3a therefore the peak concentrations do not completely explain the observed effluent concentration curves resulting from ultrasonic stimulation the increase in tailing concentration with increasing ultrasonic power is consistent with this hypothesis these observations suggest that transport distance is an important factor affecting particle transport by ultrasonic stimulation fig 4b shows that the peak concentration increased with increasing ultrasonic powers similar to the trend observed in the 33 cm soil column fig 3b this result is again attributed to the effect of ultrasonic stimulation on the particle release and transport fig 4c shows very similar breakthrough curves and peak concentrations this observation is distinct from those for the 23 cm and 33 cm soil columns figs 2c and 3c it is important to note that these results are impacted by experimental errors ambient interference and instrumental errors including errors in measuring particle turbidity in the effluent errors introduced by oscillating flow caused by the peristaltic pump variation within the compacted soil column and errors introduced by failure to apply ultrasonic stimulation these potential sources of error were assessed quantitatively and none could adequately explain the observed concentration curves the similarity in concentration curves can be attributed to a physical process related to the long transportation distance and large hydrodynamic force in this case a long transportation distance results in increased particle deposition however large hydrodynamic forces can remove any deposited particles available for ultrasonic stimulation removal another explanation is that ultrasonic waves experience energy loss by damping and attenuation thus deposited particles released by ultrasonic stimulation can be re deposited along the subsequent transport distance these two reasons can lead to similar particle concentration curves for given ultrasonic stimulations we thus conclude that any acceleration of particle transport and release by ultrasonic stimulation can be ignored given the large hydrodynamic force and long transportation distance 6 1 2 impact of column length on particle transport fig 5 a shows that the particle concentration decreased with increasing column length fig 5a also shows that flow rate and ultrasonic power were constant therefore variations in hydrodynamic force and ultrasonic stimulation cannot explain the observed effluent concentration curves fig 5b and c also support this hypothesis suggesting that deposition was enhanced with increasing transportation distance in this case the major mechanisms related to particle deposition could be a particle straining at the pores or b sedimentation caused by the particle density furthermore the importance of retention sites throats crevices and dead end pores also increased with increasing transportation distance fig 5a also reveals that the breakthrough time decreased with increasing column length note that the use of a dimensionless parameter pv can eliminate the effect of different pore volumes due to the different lengths of soil columns and provide a useful means of comparing particle breakthrough times in soil columns of different lengths in this case the acceleration of particle transport in porous media is due to the size exclusion effect in which the particles migrate through preferential pathways i e excluding immobile porosity and small pores the acceleration of particle transport also reflects the velocity distribution in a pore as the particles have definite dimensions they cannot be transported directly adjacent to the pore walls and are transported only by higher velocities nearer the pore axis particle acceleration is believed to increase with increasing transportation distance although the accelerated particles are transported through preferential paths the probability of collisions and subsequent deposition increases with increasing transportation distance resulting in significant deposition in a long soil column 6 1 3 impact of flow rate on particle transport a comparison of figs 5a 6a and 7a reveals that relative particle concentration increased with increasing flow rate this suggests that hydrodynamic forces especially the drag force and lift force are important in the inhibition of particle deposition and the acceleration of particle release and transport moreover the dlvo theory suggests that the london van der waals attractive potential is negligible relative to electrical double layer repulsion in this case shear flow caused by a high flow rate is sufficient to remove particles resulting in increasing effluent particle concentration at low flow rates the fate of particles in porous media is mainly controlled by the gravitational force other particle capture mechanisms such as capture in crevices and dead end pore sites also occur similar trends were observed in the 1000 w and 1800 w ultrasonic stimulations as shown in figs 5 7 these results show that hydrodynamic forces can be important mechanisms for particle release and transport in porous media 6 2 particle size distribution after completion of the particle transport experiments the size distribution of the peak concentration and the remaining particle mass in the sand were measured fig 8 shows curves of the median diameter of particles in the effluent at peak concentration and those retained in the soil columns as a function of ultrasonic power fig 8a b and c show results for the 23 cm 33 cm and 43 cm column lengths respectively median particle diameter is an important parameter that is typically used to represent particle size for a group of particles fig 8a suggests that the median diameter of particles retained in the 23 cm soil column slightly decreased with increasing ultrasonic power for all flow rates this can be attributed to the fact that the probability of changing the structure of the porous media increases with larger ultrasonic stimulation a higher number of dead end pore openings and small pore enlargements allow larger particles to flow through the porous media decreasing the median diameter of particles retained in the soil column the comparison of the median diameter of particles retained in the soil column for different flow rates revealed a trend of increasing median diameter with increasing flow rate fig 2 also showed that peak effluent concentration increased at higher flow rates accordingly we hypothesize that the amount of particle removal increases as the hydrodynamic force increases but that the size of particles removed by the increased flow rate is small relative to the size of particles retained in the soil column as a result the median diameter of particles retained in the soil column increased with increasing hydrodynamic force these results suggest that hydrodynamic force and ultrasonic stimulation are important controls on the size of particles retained in the soil column comparisons of median particle diameters from the effluent at peak concentrations for all three flow rates also revealed that the median particle diameter increased at higher flow rates the smallest and largest median particle diameters were observed at flow rates of 0 065 cm s and 0 195 cm s respectively while the median particle diameter was moderate at 0 130 cm s these observations provide substantial evidence that the median particle diameter at peak concentration which increases with increased flow rate is primarily affected by hydrodynamic force moreover the median particle diameter in the effluent at peak concentrations was approximately 50 of that for particles retained in the soil column in this case when ultrasonic power was 0 w straining multi particle bridging and surface deposition easily occurred for large sized particles during the process of particle transport in the soil column resulting in a significant mass of particles retained in the soil column after the experiment thus the size of particles removed by hydrodynamic force was smaller than the size retained in the soil column with increasing ultrasonic stimulation the volume of particles in the effluent increased and removal of the smaller particle size fraction was enhanced further suggesting that only smaller size fractions can be removed effectively by hydrodynamic force ultrasonic stimulation can enhance the effect of hydrodynamic force on small particles fig 8b and c reveal behavior similar to that observed in fig 8a and thus do not merit additional discussion note that the differences in the median diameter of particles at peak effluent concentrations for the three flow rates decreased with increasing column length particularly for the 43 cm column the trends of median particle diameter at peak effluent concentrations for the three flow rates were quite similar suggesting that the particle size in effluent at peak concentrations tends to be stable with increasing transport distance regardless of flow rate 6 3 results of the multiple linear regression analysis the regression results are presented in table 1 the regression coefficients represent the contribution of each predictor to the model as such larger coefficients reflect the more important controlling parameters and vice versa the coefficients of flow rate and ultrasonic power were positive in each model the coefficients of column length were negative in each model furthermore an f test was conducted to test the appropriateness of the multiple regression model as a whole the significance f of each model was 0 01 the coefficient of determination r 2 was used to check the goodness of fit from table 1 it can be seen that the quality of fitting varied for example the r 2 values in model 1 and model 2 were larger than 0 8 while the r 2 value in model 3 was only 0 698 the p values which can determine whether the individual predictors significantly affect the dependent variable were generally 0 05 confirming that the predictors influenced the dependent variable significantly however the ultrasonic power in model 2 and model 3 was far larger than 0 05 indicating that there was no correlation between ultrasonic power and the time to concentration peak or the concentration at 1 5 pv as a result the regression coefficients of the corresponding items were not significant 6 4 simulating particle transportation under ultrasonic stimulation choosing appropriate initial parameters for nonlinear regression in commonly used software packages e g matlab originpro spss tends to cause a bottleneck thus it is difficult to converge and is impossible to achieve correct final answers in this study the 1stopt 7d soft high technology inc beijing china software package was used for the analysis of the mathematical optimization problem and was utilized to simulate particle transport by ultrasonic stimulation the computation core of the software is known as the universal global optimization algorithm which shows excellent performance at nonlinear regression this algorithm is more powerful than those of more commonly used software packages for example the initial value is not necessary for numerical optimization calculation and the software can find the optimal result of nonlinear regression test datasets of the national institute of standards and technology nist employing random initial values detailed information of the software algorithm is provided in the 1stopt manual 7d soft high technology inc 2010 the goals of the simulation were to assess the main mechanisms of particle transport and fate under ultrasonic stimulation in figs 2 4 that particle peak concentration and tailing concentration increased with increasing ultrasonic power these observations become less obvious when a large hydrodynamic force removed any deposited particles available for ultrasonic stimulation removal under large flow rate conditions thus only experimental breakthrough curves at the flow rate of 0 065 cm s were simulated in our simulations the time of the injection 120 s at the flow rate of 0 065 cm s was divided into 24 sections and the time of each section was 5 s which could be considered instantaneous in relation to the experimental duration the summation of the 24 instantaneous injections which was equal to the original step injection was used to simulate particle transport by ultrasonic stimulation for this simulation by setting n an experimental constant as 1 ahfir et al 2009 chen and bai 2015 longitudinal dispersivity could be calculated using the equation 12 d α d u where α d is longitudinal dispersivity l fig 9 shows experimental and fitted curves for several representative experiments the coefficient of determination r 2 is an indicator of how well the model replicates data points the r 2 in fig 9 were larger than 0 930 which is significant at the good level only the breakthrough curves for the 1800 w ultrasonic stimulation were selected while preparing fig 9 as they are representative of particle transport behavior for all ultrasonic stimulations i e the r 2 for other ultrasonic stimulations in table 2 were also larger than 0 930 fig 9 also shows that the simulation fits describe the tailing concentration well here the inhibited particle deposition and enhanced particle release caused by ultrasonic stimulation resulting in large tailing concentration is described well by the mathematical model that considers particle release table 2 shows estimated values of u k d k y and αd as well as coefficients of determination for all flow rates of 0 065 cm s the values of u varied slightly for the 23 cm column however for the 33 cm and 43 cm columns the maximum value of u occurred without any ultrasonic stimulation while the minimum value was observed at an ultrasonic stimulation of 1800 w these observations indicate that the value of u was closely related to the shape of the experimental breakthrough curves in particular the value of u decreased with larger tailing concentrations see figs 3a and 4a furthermore values of k d in table 2 tended to be the largest in cases without ultrasonic stimulation and reached minimum values at 1800 w while values ky increased with increasing ultrasonic stimulation recovery rate represents the ratio of the particle mass in the effluent integral of the product of particle concentration in the fitting curve and flow rate to the total mass of injected particles the recovery rate in table 2 increased with increasing stimulation further supporting the effect of inhibiting particle deposition and the acceleration of particle release by ultrasonic stimulation moreover the minimum value of αd occurred without ultrasonic stimulation and the maximum value occurred with 1800 w of ultrasonic stimulation suggesting that particle spreading increased with increasing ultrasonic stimulation all of the simulations demonstrate that particle transport under ultrasonic stimulation can be well described by extending the traditional filtration theory that considers particle release 7 conclusions an experimental and theoretical investigation of the coupling effect of ultrasonic stimulation hydrodynamic force and transportation distance on particle transport and fate in porous media was undertaken specific findings are highlighted as follows 1 the principal control on particle concentration magnitude time to peak concentration and 1 5 pv was found to be flow rate followed by flow distance 2 a systematic increase in the particle peak concentration and tailing concentration was observed with increasing ultrasonic power however the impact of ultrasonic stimulation decreased with increasing hydrodynamic force and distance 3 median particle diameters in the effluent at peak concentrations which increased with greater flow rate were primarily affected by hydrodynamic force moreover median particle diameters in the effluent at peak concentrations were approximately 50 of those for particles retained in the soil column as an extension of this study further efforts should be made to 1 study the influence of ultrasonic stimulation on different types of particles 2 investigate the various ultrasonic directions on flow fluctuation and accompanying particle release and 3 investigate the frequency of ultrasonic stimulation on accelerated particle

7429,it is well established that seismic waves traveling through porous media stimulate fluid flow and accelerate particle transport however the mechanism remains poorly understood to quantify the coupling effect of hydrodynamic force transportation distance and ultrasonic stimulation on particle transport and fate in porous media laboratory experiments were conducted using custom built ultrasonic controlled soil column equipment three column lengths 23 cm 33 cm and 43 cm were selected to examine the influence of transportation distance transport experiments were performed with 0 w 600 w 1000 w 1400 w and 1800 w of applied ultrasound and flow rates of 0 065 cm s 0 130 cm s and 0 195 cm s to establish the roles of ultrasonic stimulation and hydrodynamic force the laboratory results suggest that whilst ultrasonic stimulation does inhibit suspended particle deposition and accelerate deposited particle release both hydrodynamic force and transportation distance are the principal controlling factors the median particle diameter for the peak concentration was approximately 50 of that retained in the soil column simulated particle breakthrough curves using extended

transportation distance transport and fate particle effluent curve soil column 1 introduction seismic waves cause changes in the hydrological properties of earth materials far from their causative earthquakes pride et al 2004 zheng et al 2017 for example the sumatra andaman earthquake in 2004 created water level changes with a spike and step rise pattern in fairbanks alaska sil and freymueller 2006 the lushan earthquake in 2013 induced large hydrological changes in the region and these observations were attributed to the coseismic strain and permeability changes shi et al 2014 a well near parkfield california has experienced monotonic and persistent water level rises caused by the seismic waves of local and distant earthquakes roeloffs 1998 the chi chi earthquake in taiwan caused increased pore pressure in alluvial fans which induced landslides on gentle slopes wang et al 2001 a growing body of evidence suggests that many of these hydrological changes can be attributed to the effect of seismic waves on dislodged clogged particles and the enlargement of micro cracks candela et al 2014 furthermore seismic waves in the subsurface undergo attenuation and dispersion within wide ranges of frequencies and scales consequently inducing particle movement and fluid flow in the subsurface which is usually considered to be important at ultrasonic frequencies candela et al 2015 shi et al 2014 solazzi et al 2016 sun et al 2015 despite many experiments and theories related to particle transport in porous media the intrinsic mechanisms of particle transport and fate under ultrasonic stimulation remain poorly understood candela et al 2014 faoro et al 2012 liu and manga 2009 poesio and ooms 2004 brodsky et al 2003 suggested that temporary barriers deposited by groundwater flow are dislodged by the stronger flow caused by seismic waves and candela et al 2015 demonstrated that seismic waves cause a transient phenomenon of unclogging blockages from fractures poesio and ooms 2004 showed that the removal of fouling particles by acoustic waves increases as liquid flow rate decreases candela et al 2014 concluded that permeability enhancement and recovery rate are determined by a flow driven mechanism of particle transport the movement of fine particles by seismic or ultrasonic wave induced fluid flow indicates that flow rate is a potential key to predicting and controlling particle transport and fate in porous media however simply varying the power of wave stimulation cannot sufficiently evaluate this possibility additionally ultrasonic waves suffer energy loss by damping and attenuation a distant target subsurface may not receive sufficient wave energy for the removal of various wellbore plugging particles severely restricting large scale application avvaru et al 2017 moreover owing to difficulties when allowing for contact conditions of ultrasonic signals in production wells the design of ultrasonic treatment is mainly based on practical experience the effective zone of ultrasonic treatment has not yet been investigated serdyukov and kurlenya 2007 therefore understanding the effects of flow rate transport distance and ultrasonic power on particle transport in the porous medium is of great importance in principle particle transport and fate in porous media depends on various factors that generally fall into two categories straining and non straining particle straining is where particles are retained in pore throats that are too small to allow the particles to pass through it is controlled solely by particle size and pore construction ahfir et al 2017 díaz et al 2010 for particles with smaller diameters than the pore throat non straining which depends on particle flow particle porous media and particle particle interactions including electrostatic force diffusion multi particle bridging surface deposition interception inertia and hydrodynamic force play a decisive role in transport sen and khilar 2006 zamani and maini 2009 it is generally accepted that diffusion results from the random brownian motion of water molecules it is dominant for particles with diameters of 1 μm interception can be incorporated as a boundary condition for attachment from sedimentation and diffusion inertia is only important under air conditions and is negligible for water conditions the chemical factors that influence particle transportation can be isolated by flowing deionized water overall particle transport and fate in porous media are complex multi phase processes and previous studies have not identified a specific key variable that can be used to assess particle transport in natural settings the objective of this study was to systematically investigate the influence of flow rate transport distance and ultrasonic power on particle transport and fate in porous media 2 experimental procedure laboratory experiments were performed using custom built ultrasonic controlled soil column equipment which can apply up to 1800 w of axial ultrasonic stimulation and confining pressure to a cylindrical soil column fig 1 the soil column was 6 5 cm in diameter and its height could be adjusted from 20 to 80 cm the soil column was equipped with an ultrasonic emission head at the top and two special perspex filters at the top and bottom the special perspex filters were manufactured with one surface characterized by evenly distributed 0 5 mm diameter holes and the other surface had either an inlet or an outlet hole of 15 mm diameter the special perspex filters were used to maintain uniform flow into and out of the soil column a peristaltic pump longerpump bt600 2j baoding china was employed to pump particle suspensions or deionized water downward through the vertical soil column at rates ranging from 0 05 to 0 30 cm s measured by a flow meter leierda lzb 25 wenzhou china a turbidity meter hach 2100n loveland usa placed at the outlet of the soil column measured the effluent turbidity the measurement accuracy of the turbidity meter was 2 of reading plus 0 01 turbidity ntu by measuring the turbidity of several suspensions with known particle concentrations the following equation between concentration and turbidity level was obtained and through this equation the particle concentration was calculated 1 y 0 000008 x 2 0 012 x 0 0009 where y is the particle concentration m l3 and x refers to the turbidity level ntu the particle size distribution was recorded using a laser size distribution instrument bettersize 2000 dandong china the measurement accuracy and repeatability of the laser size distribution instrument were 0 5 the equipment maintains a constant chamber temperature using a digital temperature controller rkc instrument inc tokyo japan with a precision of 0 5 c and a sampling time of 0 25 s all laboratory experiments were implemented at a chamber temperature of 22 c 24 c the experimental equipment used in this study is described in detail in chen et al 2016 crushed quartz sand yufan inc shijiazhuang china was employed for the experiments after being treated with diluted h2so4 to remove any possible contaminants the diameter of the sand ranged from 1 0 to 3 2 mm and the coefficient of curvature c c d 30 2 d 10 d 60 and uniformity index c u d 60 d 10 were 1 10 and 1 43 respectively synthetic spherical sio2 particles winroc inc wenzhou china were employed as injected particles the injected particles had a median size of 11 85 μm with a standard deviation of 9 47 skewness of 0 30 and kurtosis of 0 92 the sio2 particle density was 2 26 g cm3 and the specific surface area was 1886 4 cm2 g 1 the concentration of the injected particle suspension was 1 mg ml our primary target was to investigate the most likely mechanisms of particle transport and fate under ultrasonic stimulation thus the injected particles and sand were selected to minimize permeability reduction in all experiments each soil column was 6 5 cm in diameter and either 23 33 or 43 cm in height for each column length the soil column was compacted with 3 cm of sand in each layer after each addition of sand the resulting layer was lightly blended with the layer below and then vibrated to avoid settlement or layer separation and to simulate uniform conditions in the soil column during the column compaction the level of deionized water which was air free was always maintained above the sand surface to remove any trapped air in the pores and produce conditions of saturation in the soil column the density of the saturated soil column was 1 99 g cm3 and the total porosity calculated from the volumetric ratio between the solid phase and the entire column was 40 3 the densities and porosities of all soil columns in our study were the same three column lengths 23 cm 33 cm and 43 cm were selected to examine the influence of transportation distance for each column length five ultrasonic powers 0 w 600 w 1000 w 1400 w and 1800 w and three flow rates 0 065 cm s 0 130 cm s and 0 195 cm s were applied to investigate the role of ultrasonic stimulation and hydrodynamic force thus a total of 45 experiments were performed during each experiment step injections of the particle suspension concentration of 1 mg ml and ultrasonic stimulation were carried out simultaneously for a specific length of time 0 065 cm s flow rate 120 s 0 130 cm s flow rate 60 s 0 195 cm s flow rate 40 s subsequently ultrasonic stimulation was stopped and a three way valve was employed to switch the pumped solution to deionized water until the turbidity level in the effluent approached 0 24 ntu i e the turbidity of deionized water these lengths of time were selected to provide each column with an approximately equal mass of particles 330 mg flow rates of particle suspensions and deionized water were same throughout each experiment following completion of each soil column experiment the size distribution of particles remaining in the soil column was measured the top emission head and special perspex filter were removed and soil from six different depths equally spaced throughout the length of the column was carefully excavated into 200 ml bottles the bottles were filled with deionized water and were slowly shaken for 1 h to liberate the retained particles the size distribution of the solution was recorded using the laser size distribution instrument in addition several effluents were collected for particle size analysis with the laser size distribution instrument around the peak of the breakthrough curve after each experiment all sand in the column was cleaned with deionized water until the turbidity declined to that of deionized water the sand was then dried at 105 c in preparation for the next experiment note that each turbidity level in the effluent was measured three times with the turbidity meter if the variations of the turbidity levels among the three measurements ranged within the deviation of the turbidity meter then the average turbidity level was treated as the final value each size distribution of the solution was re measured three times if the variation in the size distribution among the three measurements ranged within the accuracy of the size distribution instrument then the average size distribution was treated as the final value several soil column experiments were replicated under identical conditions and the results show good reproducibility 3 dlvo calculation particle transport and fate in porous media are simultaneously governed by many microscopic forces such as lift buoyancy gravity electrical double layer force hydrodynamic drag and london van der waals interactions to calculate the total interaction energy between the particles and the sand surface the derjaguin landau vervey overbeek dlvo theory was employed the formula of gregory 1981 was employed to calculate the london van der waals attractive contribution while the formula of hogg et al 1966 was employed to calculate the electrical double layer repulsion the electrophoretic mobility obtained using a zetasizer nano zs90 malvern instruments corporation worcestershire uk was employed to obtain the zeta potentials of the particles 41 mv whereas the zeta potential of the quartz sand 100 mv was obtained from published literature kuznar and elimelech 2007 the value of the hamaker constant was set to 1 5 10 19 j dlvo calculations indicate that the repulsive energy barrier and secondary minimum were approximately 2356 kt and 1 1 kt respectively where t is the temperature in degrees kelvin and k is the boltzmann constant these results indicate that the london van der waals attractive potential was negligible relative to electrical double layer repulsion moreover in our experiments the attachment to the solid water interface in the primary minimum was limited and the association between particles and sand surface in the secondary energy minimum was weak 4 mathematical model as only the particle deposition effect was considered in traditional filtration theory grolimund et al 1998 herzig et al 1970 the effect of particle release caused by the hydrodynamic force or ultrasonic stimulation could be included by extending traditional filtration theory the convection dispersion and deposition dynamic equations considering particle release can be established as follows 2 c t x t d 2 c t x x 2 u c t

variable from the known values of two or more independent variables also called the predictors but it also can investigate how the variable fluctuates with changes in individual predictors in this study multiple linear regression models were used to predict the concentration peak time to concentration peak and concentration at 1 5 pv for a given set of independent variables length of column flow rate and ultrasonic power the regression model employed in this study has the following form 11 y j ε j β 1 j x 1 j β 2 j x 2 j β 3 j x 3 j where x 1 j x 2 j and x 3 j are predictors of the length of the column flow rate and ultrasonic power respectively yj is the predicted concentration peak time to concentration peak or concentration at 1 5 pv respectively β 1 j is the regression coefficient for each predictor and j is the intercept 6 results and discussion 6 1 results of the particle transportation experiments 6 1 1 impact of ultrasonic stimulation on particle transport relative particle concentration c c i in this study was the ratio between particle concentration in the effluent and the concentration of the injected particle suspension the value is dimensionless pv in this study refers to the ratio of the total volume of water passing through the soil column to the pore volume of the soil column time t replaced by pv dimensionless eliminates the effect of differences in pore volume and velocity in the soil column in experimental results in figs 2 4 a pv of zero corresponds to the initiation of particle suspension injection and ultrasonic stimulation the vertical dashed line intersecting the particle breakthrough curves indicates the end of particle suspension injection and of the ultrasonic stimulation in general the relative particle concentration increased from the beginning of injection and stimulation and reached a peak concentration after ceasing stimulation and particle suspension injection the relative particle concentration then gradually descended to a value of about 0 002 mg ml or 0 24 ntu equal to the turbidity of deionized water over the next several pv values fig 2a shows that the asymmetric shapes of the breakthrough curves for various ultrasonic powers were very similar but differs from those observed by ahfir et al 2009 who reported approximately symmetrical curves for instantaneous injection of particle suspension the asymmetric shapes of the particle breakthrough curve for the 0 w ultrasonic stimulation can be attributed to step injection which is a common method in actual engineering the asymmetric shapes of the particle breakthrough curves for the four ultrasonic stimulations also support this hypothesis furthermore a systematic increase in the concentration peak was observed with increasing ultrasonic power as the flow rate was constant throughout the experiment the hydrodynamic force cannot explain the observed effluent concentration curves the observations suggest that ultrasonic stimulation is the primary mechanism inhibiting suspended particle deposition and accelerating deposited particle release and transport in the porous media moreover the shapes of breakthrough curves at flow rates of 0 065 cm s fig 2a 0 130 cm s fig 2b and 0 195 cm s fig 2c were very similar differences in the transport behavior of particles under various ultrasonic powers decreased with increasing flow rate this is especially true for particle transport at a flow rate of 0 195 cm s the difference in peak concentrations between 0 w and 1800 w ultrasonic power was approximately 0 05 this suggests that the effect of ultrasonic stimulation on particle transport decreases with increasing hydrodynamic force as noted previously the dlvo theory suggests that deposition in the primary or secondary minimum is not expected in all experiments in the case where particle transport distance was only 23 cm particle removal was likely controlled mainly by hydrodynamic forces and ultrasonic stimulation these results provide substantial evidence that hydrodynamic force and ultrasonic stimulation are sufficient to remove particles and that minimal deposition occurs over this range of column lengths fig 3a shows the relative particle concentrations in effluent samples collected at a flow rate of 0 065 cm s for the 33 cm column without ultrasonic stimulation the effluent particle concentration quickly increased reaching a value of 0 08 and then plateaued during which concentration gradually increased to a peak of approximately 0 1 over the subsequent 0 5 pv the particle concentration then gradually dropped to a value of approximately 0 002 over the subsequent pv in comparison only single concentration peak was observed in fig 2a as the flow rate was constant throughout the experiment the step injection mode alone cannot explain the shape of the concentration peak four ultrasonic stimulations were applied and the corresponding plateau period also supports this hypothesis it is well known that particle deposition increases with longer transport distance ahfir et al 2009 and this was observed in the results of this study by comparing figs 3a and 2a all observations suggest that a gradual release of deposited particles caused by ultrasonic stimulation was the primary mechanism for the gradual increase in concentration during the plateau period in this case large volumes of particles were deposited in the longer column reflecting large volumes of deposited particles released this resulted in both the concentration plateau and also affected the concentration tailing however there were few particles deposited in the short column fig 2a reflecting fewer deposited particles released these affected only the concentration tailing for which the concentration was relatively lower than that of the concentration peak comparisons of the particle concentration curves for increasing ultrasonic stimulations reveal that the concentration peak and the duration of particle transport increased with increasing ultrasonic power this was especially true for post peak concentration curves concentration tailing the value and duration of post peak concentration increased with increasing ultrasonic power this suggests that the effect of ultrasonic stimulation on particle release and transport increases at higher ultrasonic powers all results provide substantial evidence that ultrasonic stimulation is an important mechanism for accelerating particle release and transport under low flow rate conditions fig 3b shows the relative particle concentrations of effluent samples collected from the 33 cm column at a flow rate of 0 130 cm s the shape of the breakthrough curve resembles a normal distribution curve and differs from the shape of the curve produced under the 0 065 cm s flow rate condition fig 3a the peak platform gradually disappeared in breakthrough curves at higher flow rates suggesting that a large hydrodynamic force inhibits particle deposition resulting in fewer deposited particles available for the ultrasonic stimulation comparison of the effluent concentration curves for particles transported in columns exposed to the range of ultrasonic stimulation also reveals a trend of larger peak concentrations with increasing ultrasonic power however the difference in peak effluent particle concentrations with ultrasonic stimulation was lower than that under the 0 065 cm s condition fig 3a this suggests that the acceleration of particle release and transport caused by ultrasonic stimulation decreases with increasing hydrodynamic force fig 3c shows the relative particle concentrations for effluent samples collected from the 33 cm column at a flow rate of 0 195 cm s the breakthrough curves for 0 w 600 w 1000 w and 1400 w are almost identical therefore changes in ultrasonic stimulation cannot explain the observed effluent concentration curves when the ultrasonic power was larger than 1400 w the peak value and tailing concentration increased with ultrasonic power in this case fewer particles can be deposited in the sand at a high flow rate and deposited particles can be removed only by strong ultrasonic simulation greater than 1400 w but not by a large hydrodynamic force these results indicate that ultrasonic simulation hydrodynamic force and transport distance are inextricably linked in controlling particle transport and fate in these columns fig 4 shows the relative particle concentration as a function of pv at flow rates of 0 065 cm s fig 4a 0 130 cm s fig 4b and 0 195 cm s fig 4c for a range of ultrasonic powers 0 1800 w in the 43 cm column fig 4a shows increasing peak concentrations with increased ultrasonic powers which decreased after 1400 w note that peak effluent concentration and the duration of particle transport increased with increasing ultrasonic power fig 3a therefore the peak concentrations do not completely explain the observed effluent concentration curves resulting from ultrasonic stimulation the increase in tailing concentration with increasing ultrasonic power is consistent with this hypothesis these observations suggest that transport distance is an important factor affecting particle transport by ultrasonic stimulation fig 4b shows that the peak concentration increased with increasing ultrasonic powers similar to the trend observed in the 33 cm soil column fig 3b this result is again attributed to the effect of ultrasonic stimulation on the particle release and transport fig 4c shows very similar breakthrough curves and peak concentrations this observation is distinct from those for the 23 cm and 33 cm soil columns figs 2c and 3c it is important to note that these results are impacted by experimental errors ambient interference and instrumental errors including errors in measuring particle turbidity in the effluent errors introduced by oscillating flow caused by the peristaltic pump variation within the compacted soil column and errors introduced by failure to apply ultrasonic stimulation these potential sources of error were assessed quantitatively and none could adequately explain the observed concentration curves the similarity in concentration curves can be attributed to a physical process related to the long transportation distance and large hydrodynamic force in this case a long transportation distance results in increased particle deposition however large hydrodynamic forces can remove any deposited particles available for ultrasonic stimulation removal another explanation is that ultrasonic waves experience energy loss by damping and attenuation thus deposited particles released by ultrasonic stimulation can be re deposited along the subsequent transport distance these two reasons can lead to similar particle concentration curves for given ultrasonic stimulations we thus conclude that any acceleration of particle transport and release by ultrasonic stimulation can be ignored given the large hydrodynamic force and long transportation distance 6 1 2 impact of column length on particle transport fig 5 a shows that the particle concentration decreased with increasing column length fig 5a also shows that flow rate and ultrasonic power were constant therefore variations in hydrodynamic force and ultrasonic stimulation cannot explain the observed effluent concentration curves fig 5b and c also support this hypothesis suggesting that deposition was enhanced with increasing transportation distance in this case the major mechanisms related to particle deposition could be a particle straining at the pores or b sedimentation caused by the particle density furthermore the importance of retention sites throats crevices and dead end pores also increased with increasing transportation distance fig 5a also reveals that the breakthrough time decreased with increasing column length note that the use of a dimensionless parameter pv can eliminate the effect of different pore volumes due to the different lengths of soil columns and provide a useful means of comparing particle breakthrough times in soil columns of different lengths in this case the acceleration of particle transport in porous media is due to the size exclusion effect in which the particles migrate through preferential pathways i e excluding immobile porosity and small pores the acceleration of particle transport also reflects the velocity distribution in a pore as the particles have definite dimensions they cannot be transported directly adjacent to the pore walls and are transported only by higher velocities nearer the pore axis particle acceleration is believed to increase with increasing transportation distance although the accelerated particles are transported through preferential paths the probability of collisions and subsequent deposition increases with increasing transportation distance resulting in significant deposition in a long soil column 6 1 3 impact of flow rate on particle transport a comparison of figs 5a 6a and 7a reveals that relative particle concentration increased with increasing flow rate this suggests that hydrodynamic forces especially the drag force and lift force are important in the inhibition of particle deposition and the acceleration of particle release and transport moreover the dlvo theory suggests that the london van der waals attractive potential is negligible relative to electrical double layer repulsion in this case shear flow caused by a high flow rate is sufficient to remove particles resulting in increasing effluent particle concentration at low flow rates the fate of particles in porous media is mainly controlled by the gravitational force other particle capture mechanisms such as capture in crevices and dead end pore sites also occur similar trends were observed in the 1000 w and 1800 w ultrasonic stimulations as shown in figs 5 7 these results show that hydrodynamic forces can be important mechanisms for particle release and transport in porous media 6 2 particle size distribution after completion of the particle transport experiments the size distribution of the peak concentration and the remaining particle mass in the sand were measured fig 8 shows curves of the median diameter of particles in the effluent at peak concentration and those retained in the soil columns as a function of ultrasonic power fig 8a b and c show results for the 23 cm 33 cm and 43 cm column lengths respectively median particle diameter is an important parameter that is typically used to represent particle size for a group of particles fig 8a suggests that the median diameter of particles retained in the 23 cm soil column slightly decreased with increasing ultrasonic power for all flow rates this can be attributed to the fact that the probability of changing the structure of the porous media increases with larger ultrasonic stimulation a higher number of dead end pore openings and small pore enlargements allow larger particles to flow through the porous media decreasing the median diameter of particles retained in the soil column the comparison of the median diameter of particles retained in the soil column for different flow rates revealed a trend of increasing median diameter with increasing flow rate fig 2 also showed that peak effluent concentration increased at higher flow rates accordingly we hypothesize that the amount of particle removal increases as the hydrodynamic force increases but that the size of particles removed by the increased flow rate is small relative to the size of particles retained in the soil column as a result the median diameter of particles retained in the soil column increased with increasing hydrodynamic force these results suggest that hydrodynamic force and ultrasonic stimulation are important controls on the size of particles retained in the soil column comparisons of median particle diameters from the effluent at peak concentrations for all three flow rates also revealed that the median particle diameter increased at higher flow rates the smallest and largest median particle diameters were observed at flow rates of 0 065 cm s and 0 195 cm s respectively while the median particle diameter was moderate at 0 130 cm s these observations provide substantial evidence that the median particle diameter at peak concentration which increases with increased flow rate is primarily affected by hydrodynamic force moreover the median particle diameter in the effluent at peak concentrations was approximately 50 of that for particles retained in the soil column in this case when ultrasonic power was 0 w straining multi particle bridging and surface deposition easily occurred for large sized particles during the process of particle transport in the soil column resulting in a significant mass of particles retained in the soil column after the experiment thus the size of particles removed by hydrodynamic force was smaller than the size retained in the soil column with increasing ultrasonic stimulation the volume of particles in the effluent increased and removal of the smaller particle size fraction was enhanced further suggesting that only smaller size fractions can be removed effectively by hydrodynamic force ultrasonic stimulation can enhance the effect of hydrodynamic force on small particles fig 8b and c reveal behavior similar to that observed in fig 8a and thus do not merit additional discussion note that the differences in the median diameter of particles at peak effluent concentrations for the three flow rates decreased with increasing column length particularly for the 43 cm column the trends of median particle diameter at peak effluent concentrations for the three flow rates were quite similar suggesting that the particle size in effluent at peak concentrations tends to be stable with increasing transport distance regardless of flow rate 6 3 results of the multiple linear regression analysis the regression results are presented in table 1 the regression coefficients represent the contribution of each predictor to the model as such larger coefficients reflect the more important controlling parameters and vice versa the coefficients of flow rate and ultrasonic power were positive in each model the coefficients of column length were negative in each model furthermore an f test was conducted to test the appropriateness of the multiple regression model as a whole the significance f of each model was 0 01 the coefficient of determination r 2 was used to check the goodness of fit from table 1 it can be seen that the quality of fitting varied for example the r 2 values in model 1 and model 2 were larger than 0 8 while the r 2 value in model 3 was only 0 698 the p values which can determine whether the individual predictors significantly affect the dependent variable were generally 0 05 confirming that the predictors influenced the dependent variable significantly however the ultrasonic power in model 2 and model 3 was far larger than 0 05 indicating that there was no correlation between ultrasonic power and the time to concentration peak or the concentration at 1 5 pv as a result the regression coefficients of the corresponding items were not significant 6 4 simulating particle transportation under ultrasonic stimulation choosing appropriate initial parameters for nonlinear regression in commonly used software packages e g matlab originpro spss tends to cause a bottleneck thus it is difficult to converge and is impossible to achieve correct final answers in this study the 1stopt 7d soft high technology inc beijing china software package was used for the analysis of the mathematical optimization problem and was utilized to simulate particle transport by ultrasonic stimulation the computation core of the software is known as the universal global optimization algorithm which shows excellent performance at nonlinear regression this algorithm is more powerful than those of more commonly used software packages for example the initial value is not necessary for numerical optimization calculation and the software can find the optimal result of nonlinear regression test datasets of the national institute of standards and technology nist employing random initial values detailed information of the software algorithm is provided in the 1stopt manual 7d soft high technology inc 2010 the goals of the simulation were to assess the main mechanisms of particle transport and fate under ultrasonic stimulation in figs 2 4 that particle peak concentration and tailing concentration increased with increasing ultrasonic power these observations become less obvious when a large hydrodynamic force removed any deposited particles available for ultrasonic stimulation removal under large flow rate conditions thus only experimental breakthrough curves at the flow rate of 0 065 cm s were simulated in our simulations the time of the injection 120 s at the flow rate of 0 065 cm s was divided into 24 sections and the time of each section was 5 s which could be considered instantaneous in relation to the experimental duration the summation of the 24 instantaneous injections which was equal to the original step injection was used to simulate particle transport by ultrasonic stimulation for this simulation by setting n an experimental constant as 1 ahfir et al 2009 chen and bai 2015 longitudinal dispersivity could be calculated using the equation 12 d α d u where α d is longitudinal dispersivity l fig 9 shows experimental and fitted curves for several representative experiments the coefficient of determination r 2 is an indicator of how well the model replicates data points the r 2 in fig 9 were larger than 0 930 which is significant at the good level only the breakthrough curves for the 1800 w ultrasonic stimulation were selected while preparing fig 9 as they are representative of particle transport behavior for all ultrasonic stimulations i e the r 2 for other ultrasonic stimulations in table 2 were also larger than 0 930 fig 9 also shows that the simulation fits describe the tailing concentration well here the inhibited particle deposition and enhanced particle release caused by ultrasonic stimulation resulting in large tailing concentration is described well by the mathematical model that considers particle release table 2 shows estimated values of u k d k y and αd as well as coefficients of determination for all flow rates of 0 065 cm s the values of u varied slightly for the 23 cm column however for the 33 cm and 43 cm columns the maximum value of u occurred without any ultrasonic stimulation while the minimum value was observed at an ultrasonic stimulation of 1800 w these observations indicate that the value of u was closely related to the shape of the experimental breakthrough curves in particular the value of u decreased with larger tailing concentrations see figs 3a and 4a furthermore values of k d in table 2 tended to be the largest in cases without ultrasonic stimulation and reached minimum values at 1800 w while values ky increased with increasing ultrasonic stimulation recovery rate represents the ratio of the particle mass in the effluent integral of the product of particle concentration in the fitting curve and flow rate to the total mass of injected particles the recovery rate in table 2 increased with increasing stimulation further supporting the effect of inhibiting particle deposition and the acceleration of particle release by ultrasonic stimulation moreover the minimum value of αd occurred without ultrasonic stimulation and the maximum value occurred with 1800 w of ultrasonic stimulation suggesting that particle spreading increased with increasing ultrasonic stimulation all of the simulations demonstrate that particle transport under ultrasonic stimulation can be well described by extending the traditional filtration theory that considers particle release 7 conclusions an experimental and theoretical investigation of the coupling effect of ultrasonic stimulation hydrodynamic force and transportation distance on particle transport and fate in porous media was undertaken specific findings are highlighted as follows 1 the principal control on particle concentration magnitude time to peak concentration and 1 5 pv was found to be flow rate followed by flow distance 2 a systematic increase in the particle peak concentration and tailing concentration was observed with increasing ultrasonic power however the impact of ultrasonic stimulation decreased with increasing hydrodynamic force and distance 3 median particle diameters in the effluent at peak concentrations which increased with greater flow rate were primarily affected by hydrodynamic force moreover median particle diameters in the effluent at peak concentrations were approximately 50 of those for particles retained in the soil column as an extension of this study further efforts should be made to 1 study the influence of ultrasonic stimulation on different types of particles 2 investigate the various ultrasonic directions on flow fluctuation and accompanying particle release and 3 investigate the frequency of ultrasonic stimulation on accelerated particle
