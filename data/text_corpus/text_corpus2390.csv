11950,the concentrations of uranium in one hundred and five groundwater samples collected from bhiwani and charkhi dadri districts of haryana state india were determined using led fluorimetry to estimate annual effective dose cancer and chemical toxicity risks for inhabitants of these areas uranium concentrations varied from 1 to 300 μg l 1 with an average value of 28 μg l 1 and a median of 15 μg l 1 approximately 25 of the samples exceeded the provisional guideline value of 30 μg l 1 recommended by the world health organization the age dependent annual effective doses varied from 1 1 to 753 μsv y 1 with an average value of 47 μsv y 1 the infants have received relatively high mean annual effective doses compared to the other age groups the average value of cancer mortality and cancer morbidity risk was found as 4 1 10 5 and 6 3 10 5 respectively which are lower than the indian permissible limit of 1 67 10 4 the lifetime average daily doses of uranium varied from 0 03 to 8 57 μg kg 1 day 1 a positive correlation was observed between uranium concentration and total dissolved solids graphical abstract image 1 keywords age dependent radiation dose drinking water physicochemical parameters toxicological risk uranium 1 introduction uranium is a naturally occurring element found in rocks soil water and air the natural uranium is a mixture of three different isotopes 238u 235u and 234u with abundances of 99 27 0 72 and 0 0054 respectively who 2011 unscear 2008 the main factors responsible for uranium contamination in groundwater a amount of uranium contained in an aquifer s rocks b water rock interactions that cause the uranium to be extracted from those rocks c oxidation conditions that enhance the extracted uranium s solubility in water d interaction of the extracted uranium with other chemicals in the groundwater such as bicarbonate which can further enhance its solubility e human factors such as groundwater table decline use of phosphate fertilizers for agriculture purpose and nitrate pollution may be exacerbating the problem bajwa et al 2017 smedley et al 2006 seddique et al 2020 thivya et al 2015 smidt et al 2011 calculated conservatively that up to a quarter u 0 5 μg l 1 to three third u 0 1 μg l 1 worst case scenario of all drinking water samples n 369 11 with 2 μg l 1 0 5 with 10 μg l 1 0 3 with 20 μg l 1 in the northern plains of germany could be contaminated with uranium from fertilization the percentage of uranium from previous fertilizer applications in groundwater depends on regionally differing geogenous background concentrations in soils in regions with a low natural uranium background more than 90 of the uranium in groundwater can be already fertilizer derived riegel 2009 smidt et al 2011 calculated that 2 1 t uranium is extracted annually from german aquifers with drinking water uranium has both chemical and radiological toxicity with the two important target organs being the kidneys and lungs who 2011 atsdr 2013 weinhold 2012 duggal et al 2020 kumar et al 2020 abu khader et al 2018 retention of uranium in the kidney has been attributed to the creation of complexes with proteins and phospholipids in the proximal tubules considered to be the main site of kidney damage abbasi 1998 has discussed the possible mechanism for the toxic action of the uranyl ion in the kidney uranyl ion circulates in the blood plasma as a relatively inert but acid labile bicarbonate uranyl complex this could be filtered into the kidney tubules and uranyl ion is set free by the action of hydrogen ions the uranyl ion is thought to be liberated and concentrated in the tubular lumen as a result of normal tubular action the ions however cause damage to kidney structures which if severe enough results in kidney failure uranium also appears to affect the brain neurological signs and pathological changes in the cerebellar and cerebral cortices have been observed in rabbits exposed to soluble uranium salts berlin and rudell 1986 several studies have been conducted worldwide to measure natural uranium concentrations in drinking water and associated health risks in the german study radespiel tröger and meyer 2013 the average uranium content was below 20 μg l 1 the researchers noted a slightly increased risk of leukemia in men and kidney and lung cancer in women relative risk ranging from 1 12 to 1 28 and concluded that these results may require further investigations a recent study lariviere et al 2012 found a strong correlation between uranium concentration in drinking water and uranium in bone suggesting that bone is a good indicator of uranium exposure via ingestion of drinking water duggal et al 2017 estimated uranium ingestion dose and its toxicity considering different age groups in northern rajasthan india and concluded that the probability of carcinogenic risk was negligible in this region due to intake of groundwater warner et al 2011 investigated the possible sources of uranium in well water up to 5570 μg l 1 near simpsonville south carolina usa the author concluded that the biotite granite is the most likely source of uranium in the enriched wells near simpsonville and the primary magmatic crystallization produced several uranium bearing minerals in the granite of which uraninite is the most important carrier of uranium there is a wide range of opinions on uranium standards guidelines and health goals both nationally and internationally table 1 a review of the literature reveals that data on the concentration of uranium in groundwater is broadly available for many states of india but no such study has been carried out in the southwest central districts of haryana state earlier this study aims to understand the distribution of uranium in groundwater and compare the observed concentrations with drinking water quality guidelines standards to compute age dependent annual effective doses and to determine radiological and chemical toxicity risks to humans due to ingestion of uranium in drinking water the physicochemical parameters were also quantified to measure the groundwater quality and to find the correlation if any with the determined uranium concentrations 2 geology of study area the haryana state is located between 27 39 and 30 35 north latitudes and 74 28 and 77 36 east longitude in north india the study area bhiwani and charkhi dadri is situated in the southwest central part of haryana state covering a geographical area of 5140 km2 the study area has a population density of 342 inhabitants per square kilometer fig 1 shows the geographic location of the bhiwani and charkhi dadri districts on the map of haryana as well as the location of the sampling sites the climate of the study area can be classified as tropical steppe semi arid and hot which is mainly dry with very hot summer and cold winter except during monsoon season when moist air of oceanic origin penetrates the district there are four seasons in a year the hot weather season starts from mid march to the last week of june followed by the monsoon which lasts up to september the transition period from september to october forms the post monsoon season the winter season starts late in november and remains up to the first week of march the normal annual rainfall of the study area is 420 mm which is unevenly distributed over the area and occurs mainly in the monsoon season generally rainfall in the study area increases from southwest to northeast the principal source of groundwater recharge is rainfall temperatures remain relatively high throughout the year with the summer months of april to early july having average daily temperatures of around 38 c during the monsoon there are frequent heavy rains and thunderstorms the winter months are mild and pleasant with average temperatures ranging from 15 to 18 c there are however occasional cold waves that lead to temperatures near freezing the average temperature of the past years is 25 3 c the study area consists of flat and level plain interrupted from place to place by clusters of sand dunes isolated hillocks and rocky ridges the geological formations met within the study area are ferruginous chiastolite schist associated argillaceous rocks of the aravalli group alwar quartzite of the delhi system malani suite of volcanic of lower vindhyan age older alluvial deposits of quaternary age and aeolian sands of recent age older alluvium occurs extensively in the study area consisting of interbedded lenticular interfingering deposits of gravel sand silt clay and kanker mixed in various proportions the tosham igneous complex in the bhiwani district is reported to be rich in acid volcanic and granite solids kochhar 1983 the tosham igneous complex has 3 main hills khanak tosham and riwasa and several other smaller rocky outcrops nigana dulehri dharan dadam and kharkari makhwan these hills are mainly composed of granite porphyries granites and granite porphyries are of high heat producing type kochhar 1983 its lithography structure has attracted researchers in this area groundwater occurs in alluvium and aeolian sands and underlying jointed and fractured hard rocks formations also form the aquifers in alluvium sands silt kankar and gravel form the water bearing zones groundwater occurs under water table conditions in shallow aquifer zones whereas in the deeper zones confined semi confined conditions exist hard rocks comprised of the aravalli group of rocks malani suite of volcanic and alwar quartzites of the delhi system are water bearing kochhar 1989 2000 the area covered by the forest agriculture horticulture aravalli hills and mining is 4200 293797 11500 817 and 322 2 ha respectively the study region is bounded by the hisar district in the north churu district of rajasthan in the west rohtak and jhajjar districts in the east and mahengragarh and rewari districts of haryana in the south cgwb bhiwani 2012 duggal et al 2018 3 materials and methods 3 1 sample collection and physicochemical parameters a total of one hundred and five groundwater samples were collected from the bhiwani and charkhi dadri districts of haryana the sources of water comprise bore wells electric motors tube wells and hand pumps sampling sites were chosen where water is continuously used for human consumption as well as animals and in crop production the sampling sites were also chosen in such a manner that the study area is uniformly represented the position of each sampling site was determined by using a portable global positioning system gps the water freshness was maintained by pumping out enough water for about 10 min before sampling before collection the water samples were filtered using 0 45 μm whatman filter paper to remove suspended matter sediments and then stored in pre cleaned acid washed polyethylene bottles until analysis physico chemical parameters such as ph tds and ec in groundwater samples were determined in situ using a portable microcontroller water analysis kit npc 362d the instrument was calibrated using standard solutions that bracketed the expected values 3 2 instrumentation the led fluorimeter model lf 2a developed by quantalase enterprises private limited indore india was used for the analysis of uranium in drinking water the instrument has lower and upper detection limits of 0 5 μg l 1 and 1000 μg l 1 respectively with an accuracy of 10 the instrument consists primarily of 3 components light emitting diodes leds as a source of excitation a sample section and a photomultiplier tube pmt as a detector fig s1 in the supplementary material the led source emits ultraviolet radiation with wavelength 400 nm carrying 20 μj energy and pulse duration of 20 μs at a repetition rate of 1000 pulses per second excites the uranyl ions present in the water sample placed in the sample section on de excitation green fluorescence emitted by uranyl ions is measured by sensitive pmt sodium pyrophosphate na4p2o7 10h2o solution 5 was prepared in double distilled water and its ph was adjusted to 7 by dropwise addition of orthophosphoric acid this solution acts as a fluorescence enhancing reagent to give an estimate of the concentration of uranium in a given sample the instrument takes an average of 1280 pulses the calibration is done by icp ms 66n 0 01x 1 having a concentration of 100 μg ml 1 density 1 011 g ml 1 and manufactured by accustandard usa the reproducibility of data was verified from the results of the replicate analysis blank measurements are repeated after every five samples to arrest memory effects contamination and to avoid handling errors details about the calibration of the instrument analytical method and quality control are given elsewhere prasad et al 2019 kumar et al 2016 the concentration of uranium was estimated using the following equations sharma et al 2019 1 calibration factor cf uranium concentration in standard solution fluorescence of standard fluorescence of water 2 uranium concentration in unknown sample cf fluorescence from sample fluorescence from water 3 3 age dependent dose assessment the uranium activity concentration was determined using a unit conversion factor of 1 μg l 1 0 0252 bq l 1 sahoo et al 2010 rani et al 2013 the annual effective dose for different age groups from ingestion of uranium in water was determined as bronzovic and marovic 2005 3 ingestion dose sv y 1 u a dwi dcf 365 where ua is the uranium activity concentration bq l 1 dwi is the age dependent daily water intake l day 1 prescribed by the institute of medicine of the national academies 2005 and dcf is the dose conversion factor for specific age groups sv bq 1 given by the international atomic energy agency iaea 2011 3 4 potential health risk assessment the permissible limit for uranium in drinking water as prescribed by various countries and environmental protection organizations is very different therefore it is better to compare the quality of groundwater based on radiological and chemical toxicity caused by ingestion of uranium containing groundwater in the human body than to assess its suitability based on its absolute concentration shin et al 2016 duggal et al 2017 sharma et al 2019 3 4 1 radiological toxicity risk assessment radiological toxicity risk is expressed in terms of excess cancer risk ecr which was evaluated by multiplying the uranium activity concentration ua bq l 1 and risk factor rf l bq 1 usepa 2000 4 ecr u a rf the risk factor rf was determined as follows 5 rf l bq 1 rc irw ed where rc uranium risk coefficient bq 1 irw water ingestion rate 2 l day 1 who 2011 and ed exposure duration 70 years i e 70 365 25 550 days who 2011 rani et al 2013 according to the usepa 1999 the mortality and morbidity cancer risk coefficients of 1 13 10 9 bq 1 and 1 73 10 9 bq 1 respectively have been used for the estimation of cancer mortality risk and cancer morbidity risk of uranium over lifetime consumption of groundwater 3 4 2 chemical toxicity risk assessment the chemical toxicity risk from exposure to uranium is quantified in terms of the lifetime average daily dose ladd and hazard quotient hq ladd is defined as the quantity of uranium ingested per kilogram of body weight per day and was evaluated using the following equation usepa 2000 who 2011 shin

hq was calculated using the following equation 7 hq ladd rfd where rfd reference dose its value is 1 0 μg kg 1 day 1 who 2011 2012 ansoborlo et al 2015 stalder et al 2012 waseem et al 2015 sharma and singh 2016 if hq is found to be less than unity then no adverse health effects are expected due to the exposure of uranium 4 results and discussion 4 1 distribution of uranium in groundwater table 2 presents the summary statistics of uranium concentrations μg l 1 in groundwater the concentrations of uranium ranged between 1 and 300 μg l 1 with an average value of 28 μg l 1 and a median of 15 μg l 1 and approximately 24 8 of the samples exceeded the provisional guideline value pgv of 30 μg l 1 who 2011 table s1 in the supplementary material the standard deviation value is higher than the mean and median values indicating that uranium concentrations are spread out over a wider range table 2 when comparing the mean and median values of uranium concentrations it is observed that the data are not symmetrically distributed it is a right skewed distribution as the mean value is approximate twice the median value the kurtosis and skewness values are of a positive type the data are highly skewed which may be attributed to the variation in the geological formation of the study region the kurtosis is greater than 3 so the distribution is leptokurtic which means that compared to a normal distribution its tails are longer and fatter and its central peak is higher and sharper high uranium concentrations observed in groundwater samples of the study region may be due to local natural geology industrial activities in the region or the use of phosphate fertilizers in huge quantities for agriculture purposes but overall it seems that the plausible source of high uranium observed may be geogenic in nature the high concentrations of uranium in the tosham kharkari makhwan and khanak regions are due to the presence of uranium rich granites and felsic volcanic rock formations of the aravalli group of rocks malani suite of volcanic and alwar quartzites of the delhi system kochhar 1983 1989 2000 the alluvium aquifers of the study region are composed of sand silt kankar and gravel and these aquifers are semi confined similar to the other alluvium aquifers in northwest india such as punjab and rajasthan bonsor et al 2017 many studies coyte et al 2018 duggal et al 2017 sharma et al 2019 bajwa et al 2017 have reported uranium concentrations above 30 μg l 1 in the states of punjab and rajasthan which are associated primarily with alluvial aquifers the findings of these studies are consistent with our results which find high uranium concentrations in groundwater from alluvial aquifers mann et al 2018 reported high activity concentrations of 226ra 232th and 40k in soil samples collected from the sirsa fatehabad hisar and bhiwani districts of haryana 4 2 comparison of uranium concentrations with other studies the observed concentrations were also compared with the worldwide literature table 3 the uranium concentrations in water samples from northern rajasthan haryana and karnataka states of india and pakistan are comparable with the present study however the uranium concentrations are higher in the drinking water of sw punjab india ne portugal southern finland and middle korea whereas the uranium concentrations in the usa nigeria australia greece bangladesh korea ghana fujian province china jammu and kashmir himachal pradesh uttarakhand uttar pradesh bihar jharkhand west bengal chhattisgarh odisha maharashtra tamilnadu andhra pradesh and kerala states of india are lower than the concentrations found in the present study 4 3 depth profile of uranium in groundwater the groundwater samples were collected from different depths to study the vertical distribution of uranium concentration to investigate possible connections between uranium concentration and depth of groundwater fig 2 the values of the first quartile third quartile and interquartile ranges iqr were 5 8 39 and 33 2 μg l 1 respectively for the shallow groundwater sources of depth 50 m for the depth range of 50 100 m the values of the first quartile and third quartiles are 7 3 and 18 μg l 1 respectively giving a large iqr of 10 7 μg l 1 the values of the first quartile third quartile and iqr are 4 95 15 and 10 05 μg l 1 respectively for deep sources of depth 100 m the mean concentration of uranium 33 16 μg l 1 from shallow groundwater sources 50 m is nearly 3 6 times the mean concentration 9 31 μg l 1 from deep groundwater sources 100 m the week negative correlation between uranium and depth r 0 19 indicating that drilling deeper hand pumps can assess groundwater with lower uranium concentrations the results obtained from the study area indicates that the uranium concentration varies primarily due to recharge and discharge the rainfall recharge increases the groundwater level which in turn increases the uranium concentration in groundwater the recharging water reacts with the weathered rocks in the unsaturated zone and the leached out uranium increases uranium concentration in groundwater however as the recharge continues the concentration of uranium in groundwater begins to reduce due to dilution by comparatively fresh recharging water the uranium concentration in groundwater of the study area increases from recharge northeast to discharge area southwest 4 4 correlation between uranium and physicochemical parameters the physicochemical parameters ph tds and ec of the groundwater samples are reported in table 2 and table s1 the groundwater in the study area is alkaline the acceptable limit for ph as prescribed by bis 2012 and who 2011 is 6 5 8 5 four water samples have a ph value above 8 5 the who 2011 has suggested that water ph has no direct impact on consumers activity increases the capacity of water to attack geological materials and leach toxic metals into the water making it potentially harmful for human consumption the results showed that tds value in approximately 89 5 and 40 of the samples exceeded the bis 2012 allowed limit of 500 mg l 1 and permissible limit of 2000 mg l 1 the results showed that ec value in 89 5 of the samples exceeded the water act 1956 maximum permissible limit of 1000 μs cm 1 and 77 of the samples exceeded the who 1993 guideline value of 1500 μs cm 1 no significant correlation was observed between uranium and ph table 4 the positive correlation of uranium with tds r 0 41 suggested that this parameter influences and controls the mobility of uranium in groundwater many studies reported the groundwater with high concentrations of dissolved solids is generally the most radioactive ortega et al 1996 singh et al 2003 duggal et al 2016 2017 4 5 age dependent annual effective dose aed the calculated annual effective dose due to intake of uranium through drinking water for various age groups ranged between 1 1 and 753 μsv y 1 with an average value of 47 μsv y 1 table 5 the who 2011 guidelines fourth edition and the european union council directive 2013 prescribed the measurement of reference dose level rdl of the aed received from drinking water ingestion at 100 μsv y 1 this rdl is 4 2 of the average aed of 2 4 msv y 1 from natural background radiation who 2011 unscear 2008 even though infants consume less water than other age groups the aed is significantly higher in infants than in other age groups because of the differences in infants metabolism and smaller organ weights resulting in higher doses for many radionuclides duggal et al 2017 the aed is slightly higher for the 7 12 months age group of infants as compared to the 0 6 months due to higher annual water intake due to the lower water ingestion rate all the age groups of females receive lower aeds as compared to males the higher aeds during the lactation and pregnancy periods may be attributed to the need for more water in those periods the results showed that eleven samples exceeded the reference level of 100 μsv y 1 for male adults 4 6 radiological toxicity risk the results of cancer mortality risk and cancer morbidity risk are presented in table 6 the estimated mean values of cancer mortality and cancer morbidity risks were lower than the permissible limit of 1 67 10 4 as prescribed by aerb 2004 some studies have reported 10 3 as the acceptable level for radiological risk tran et al 2000 kim et al 2004 under indian conditions the concentration of uranium that poses the carcinogenic risk would be equal to 115 μg l 1 and this high level of uranium was found in four samples birhi kalan b 20 bhiwani city b 60 gendawas b 73 and milakpur b 105 table s2 in supplementary material therefore the long term intake of groundwater from these sites may stochastically increase carcinogenic risk through internal radiation exposure based on maximum uranium concentrations it can be concluded that due to continuous exposure to uranium through consumption of groundwater there could be the occurrence of 44 cancer cases per one lac of the population the values of cancer mortality risk are comparable to those reported in northern rajasthan india 3 7 10 6 to 2 5 10 4 by duggal et al 2017 uttarakhand state india 5 04 10 8 to 1 79 10 4 by prasad et al 2019 punjab state india 1 34 10 6 to 1 80 10 3 by saini et al 2016 sonipat district haryana 2 60 10 5 to 4 39 10 4 and panipat district haryana 4 2 10 5 to 3 49 10 4 by daulta et al 2018 4 7 chemical toxicity risk the lifetime average daily dose ladd of uranium due to ingestion of groundwater ranged between 0 03 and 8 57 μg kg 1 day 1 and the hq accordingly has the same numerical values because rfd is unity who 2011 table 6 approximately 23 5 of the samples showed a hazard quotient greater than unity table s2 in the supplementary material indicating a significant risk due to the chemical toxicity of uranium the kidney is considered to be the main target organ for the chemical toxicity of uranium uranium accumulates in the renal tubular epithelium and causes cellular necrosis and atrophy in the tubular wall leading to decreased reabsorption of amino acids and small proteins by the renal tubules leggett 1989 therefore periodic monitoring and management are needed for these areas the ladd observed in the present study is comparable to those reported in northern rajasthan india 0 07 4 89 μg kg 1 day 1 by duggal et al 2017 uttarakhand state india 0 001 3 69 μg kg 1 day 1 by prasad et al 2019 jammu district jammu kashmir india 0 01 1 52 μg kg 1 day 1 by kumar et al 2016 sonipat district haryana 0 616 10 383 μg kg 1 day 1 and panipat district haryana 0 998 8 259 μg kg 1 day 1 by daulta et al 2018 5 conclusions the results show that 24 8 of the samples exceeded the who pgv the uranium concentration in groundwater varies primarily due to recharge and discharge which would have dissolved or leached the uranium from the weathered soil to the groundwater the positive correlation between tds and uranium in groundwater suggests that tds influences the mobility of uranium in groundwater the mean aeds for all age groups were well below the recommended rdl of 100 μsv y 1 the infants have received relatively high mean aeds compared to other age groups the mean values of cancer mortality risk and cancer morbidity risk were well below the aerb s permissible limit approximately 21 of the samples showed hq 1 indicating chemical toxicity due to the presence of uranium in groundwater therefore unsuitable for drinking remedial action is required at sampling sites

11950,the concentrations of uranium in one hundred and five groundwater samples collected from bhiwani and charkhi dadri districts of haryana state india were determined using led fluorimetry to estimate annual effective dose cancer and chemical toxicity risks for inhabitants of these areas uranium concentrations varied from 1 to 300 μg l 1 with an average value of 28 μg l 1 and a median of 15 μg l 1 approximately 25 of the samples exceeded the provisional guideline value of 30 μg l 1 recommended by the world health organization the age dependent annual effective doses varied from 1 1 to 753 μsv y 1 with an average value of 47 μsv y 1 the infants have received relatively high mean annual effective doses compared to the other age groups the average value of cancer mortality and cancer morbidity risk was found as 4 1 10 5 and 6 3 10 5 respectively which are lower than the indian permissible limit of 1 67 10 4 the lifetime average daily doses of uranium varied from 0 03 to 8 57 μg kg 1 day 1 a positive correlation was observed between uranium concentration and total dissolved solids graphical abstract image 1 keywords age dependent radiation dose drinking water physicochemical parameters toxicological risk uranium 1 introduction uranium is a naturally occurring element found in rocks soil water and air the natural uranium is a mixture of three different isotopes 238u 235u and 234u with abundances of 99 27 0 72 and 0 0054 respectively who 2011 unscear 2008 the main factors responsible for uranium contamination in groundwater a amount of uranium contained in an aquifer s rocks b water rock interactions that cause the uranium to be extracted from those rocks c oxidation conditions that enhance the extracted uranium s solubility in water d interaction of the extracted uranium with other chemicals in the groundwater such as bicarbonate which can further enhance its solubility e human factors such as groundwater table decline use of phosphate fertilizers for agriculture purpose and nitrate pollution may be exacerbating the problem bajwa et al 2017 smedley et al 2006 seddique et al 2020 thivya et al 2015 smidt et al 2011 calculated conservatively that up to a quarter u 0 5 μg l 1 to three third u 0 1 μg l 1 worst case scenario of all drinking water samples n 369 11 with 2 μg l 1 0 5 with 10 μg l 1 0 3 with 20 μg l 1 in the northern plains of germany could be contaminated with uranium from fertilization the percentage of uranium from previous fertilizer applications in groundwater depends on regionally differing geogenous background concentrations in soils in regions with a low natural uranium background more than 90 of the uranium in groundwater can be already fertilizer derived riegel 2009 smidt et al 2011 calculated that 2 1 t uranium is extracted annually from german aquifers with drinking water uranium has both chemical and radiological toxicity with the two important target organs being the kidneys and lungs who 2011 atsdr 2013 weinhold 2012 duggal et al 2020 kumar et al 2020 abu khader et al 2018 retention of uranium in the kidney has been attributed to the creation of complexes with proteins and phospholipids in the proximal tubules considered to be the main site of kidney damage abbasi 1998 has discussed the possible mechanism for the toxic action of the uranyl ion in the kidney uranyl ion circulates in the blood plasma as a relatively inert but acid labile bicarbonate uranyl complex this could be filtered into the kidney tubules and uranyl ion is set free by the action of hydrogen ions the uranyl ion is thought to be liberated and concentrated in the tubular lumen as a result of normal tubular action the ions however cause damage to kidney structures which if severe enough results in kidney failure uranium also appears to affect the brain neurological signs and pathological changes in the cerebellar and cerebral cortices have been observed in rabbits exposed to soluble uranium salts berlin and rudell 1986 several studies have been conducted worldwide to measure natural uranium concentrations in drinking water and associated health risks in the german study radespiel tröger and meyer 2013 the average uranium content was below 20 μg l 1 the researchers noted a slightly increased risk of leukemia in men and kidney and lung cancer in women relative risk ranging from 1 12 to 1 28 and concluded that these results may require further investigations a recent study lariviere et al 2012 found a strong correlation between uranium concentration in drinking water and uranium in bone suggesting that bone is a good indicator of uranium exposure via ingestion of drinking water duggal et al 2017 estimated uranium ingestion dose and its toxicity considering different age groups in northern rajasthan india and concluded that the probability of carcinogenic risk was negligible in this region due to intake of groundwater warner et al 2011 investigated the possible sources of uranium in well water up to 5570 μg l 1 near simpsonville south carolina usa the author concluded that the biotite granite is the most likely source of uranium in the enriched wells near simpsonville and the primary magmatic crystallization produced several uranium bearing minerals in the granite of which uraninite is the most important carrier of uranium there is a wide range of opinions on uranium standards guidelines and health goals both nationally and internationally table 1 a review of the literature reveals that data on the concentration of uranium in groundwater is broadly available for many states of india but no such study has been carried out in the southwest central districts of haryana state earlier this study aims to understand the distribution of uranium in groundwater and compare the observed concentrations with drinking water quality guidelines standards to compute age dependent annual effective doses and to determine radiological and chemical toxicity risks to humans due to ingestion of uranium in drinking water the physicochemical parameters were also quantified to measure the groundwater quality and to find the correlation if any with the determined uranium concentrations 2 geology of study area the haryana state is located between 27 39 and 30 35 north latitudes and 74 28 and 77 36 east longitude in north india the study area bhiwani and charkhi dadri is situated in the southwest central part of haryana state covering a geographical area of 5140 km2 the study area has a population density of 342 inhabitants per square kilometer fig 1 shows the geographic location of the bhiwani and charkhi dadri districts on the map of haryana as well as the location of the sampling sites the climate of the study area can be classified as tropical steppe semi arid and hot which is mainly dry with very hot summer and cold winter except during monsoon season when moist air of oceanic origin penetrates the district there are four seasons in a year the hot weather season starts from mid march to the last week of june followed by the monsoon which lasts up to september the transition period from september to october forms the post monsoon season the winter season starts late in november and remains up to the first week of march the normal annual rainfall of the study area is 420 mm which is unevenly distributed over the area and occurs mainly in the monsoon season generally rainfall in the study area increases from southwest to northeast the principal source of groundwater recharge is rainfall temperatures remain relatively high throughout the year with the summer months of april to early july having average daily temperatures of around 38 c during the monsoon there are frequent heavy rains and thunderstorms the winter months are mild and pleasant with average temperatures ranging from 15 to 18 c there are however occasional cold waves that lead to temperatures near freezing the average temperature of the past years is 25 3 c the study area consists of flat and level plain interrupted from place to place by clusters of sand dunes isolated hillocks and rocky ridges the geological formations met within the study area are ferruginous chiastolite schist associated argillaceous rocks of the aravalli group alwar quartzite of the delhi system malani suite of volcanic of lower vindhyan age older alluvial deposits of quaternary age and aeolian sands of recent age older alluvium occurs extensively in the study area consisting of interbedded lenticular interfingering deposits of gravel sand silt clay and kanker mixed in various proportions the tosham igneous complex in the bhiwani district is reported to be rich in acid volcanic and granite solids kochhar 1983 the tosham igneous complex has 3 main hills khanak tosham and riwasa and several other smaller rocky outcrops nigana dulehri dharan dadam and kharkari makhwan these hills are mainly composed of granite porphyries granites and granite porphyries are of high heat producing type kochhar 1983 its lithography structure has attracted researchers in this area groundwater occurs in alluvium and aeolian sands and underlying jointed and fractured hard rocks formations also form the aquifers in alluvium sands silt kankar and gravel form the water bearing zones groundwater occurs under water table conditions in shallow aquifer zones whereas in the deeper zones confined semi confined conditions exist hard rocks comprised of the aravalli group of rocks malani suite of volcanic and alwar quartzites of the delhi system are water bearing kochhar 1989 2000 the area covered by the forest agriculture horticulture aravalli hills and mining is 4200 293797 11500 817 and 322 2 ha respectively the study region is bounded by the hisar district in the north churu district of rajasthan in the west rohtak and jhajjar districts in the east and mahengragarh and rewari districts of haryana in the south cgwb bhiwani 2012 duggal et al 2018 3 materials and methods 3 1 sample collection and physicochemical parameters a total of one hundred and five groundwater samples were collected from the bhiwani and charkhi dadri districts of haryana the sources of water comprise bore wells electric motors tube wells and hand pumps sampling sites were chosen where water is continuously used for human consumption as well as animals and in crop production the sampling sites were also chosen in such a manner that the study area is uniformly represented the position of each sampling site was determined by using a portable global positioning system gps the water freshness was maintained by pumping out enough water for about 10 min before sampling before collection the water samples were filtered using 0 45 μm whatman filter paper to remove suspended matter sediments and then stored in pre cleaned acid washed polyethylene bottles until analysis physico chemical parameters such as ph tds and ec in groundwater samples were determined in situ using a portable microcontroller water analysis kit npc 362d the instrument was calibrated using standard solutions that bracketed the expected values 3 2 instrumentation the led fluorimeter model lf 2a developed by quantalase enterprises private limited indore india was used for the analysis of uranium in drinking water the instrument has lower and upper detection limits of 0 5 μg l 1 and 1000 μg l 1 respectively with an accuracy of 10 the instrument consists primarily of 3 components light emitting diodes leds as a source of excitation a sample section and a photomultiplier tube pmt as a detector fig s1 in the supplementary material the led source emits ultraviolet radiation with wavelength 400 nm carrying 20 μj energy and pulse duration of 20 μs at a repetition rate of 1000 pulses per second excites the uranyl ions present in the water sample placed in the sample section on de excitation green fluorescence emitted by uranyl ions is measured by sensitive pmt sodium pyrophosphate na4p2o7 10h2o solution 5 was prepared in double distilled water and its ph was adjusted to 7 by dropwise addition of orthophosphoric acid this solution acts as a fluorescence enhancing reagent to give an estimate of the concentration of uranium in a given sample the instrument takes an average of 1280 pulses the calibration is done by icp ms 66n 0 01x 1 having a concentration of 100 μg ml 1 density 1 011 g ml 1 and manufactured by accustandard usa the reproducibility of data was verified from the results of the replicate analysis blank measurements are repeated after every five samples to arrest memory effects contamination and to avoid handling errors details about the calibration of the instrument analytical method and quality control are given elsewhere prasad et al 2019 kumar et al 2016 the concentration of uranium was estimated using the following equations sharma et al 2019 1 calibration factor cf uranium concentration in standard solution fluorescence of standard fluorescence of water 2 uranium concentration in unknown sample cf fluorescence from sample fluorescence from water 3 3 age dependent dose assessment the uranium activity concentration was determined using a unit conversion factor of 1 μg l 1 0 0252 bq l 1 sahoo et al 2010 rani et al 2013 the annual effective dose for different age groups from ingestion of uranium in water was determined as bronzovic and marovic 2005 3 ingestion dose sv y 1 u a dwi dcf 365 where ua is the uranium activity concentration bq l 1 dwi is the age dependent daily water intake

iaea 2011 3 4 potential health risk assessment the permissible limit for uranium in drinking water as prescribed by various countries and environmental protection organizations is very different therefore it is better to compare the quality of groundwater based on radiological and chemical toxicity caused by ingestion of uranium containing groundwater in the human body than to assess its suitability based on its absolute concentration shin et al 2016 duggal et al 2017 sharma et al 2019 3 4 1 radiological toxicity risk assessment radiological toxicity risk is expressed in terms of excess cancer risk ecr which was evaluated by multiplying the uranium activity concentration ua bq l 1 and risk factor rf l bq 1 usepa 2000 4 ecr u a rf the risk factor rf was determined as follows 5

the usepa 1999 the mortality and morbidity cancer risk coefficients of 1 13 10 9 bq 1 and 1 73 10 9 bq 1 respectively have been used for the estimation of cancer mortality risk and cancer morbidity risk of uranium over lifetime consumption of groundwater 3 4 2 chemical toxicity risk assessment the chemical toxicity risk from exposure to uranium is quantified in terms of the lifetime average daily dose ladd and hazard quotient hq ladd is defined as the quantity of uranium ingested per kilogram of body weight per day and was evaluated using the following equation usepa 2000 who 2011 shin

singh 2016 if hq is found to be less than unity then no adverse health effects are expected due to the exposure of uranium 4 results and discussion 4 1 distribution of uranium in groundwater table 2 presents the summary statistics of uranium concentrations μg l 1 in groundwater the concentrations of uranium ranged between 1 and 300 μg l 1 with an average value of 28 μg l 1 and a median of 15 μg l 1 and approximately 24 8 of the samples exceeded the provisional guideline value pgv of 30 μg l 1 who 2011 table s1 in the supplementary material the standard deviation value is higher than the mean and median values indicating that uranium concentrations are spread out over a wider range table 2 when comparing the mean and median values of uranium concentrations it is observed that the data are not symmetrically distributed it is a right skewed distribution as the mean value is approximate twice the median value the kurtosis and skewness values are of a positive type the data are highly skewed which may be attributed to the variation in the geological formation of the study region the kurtosis is greater than 3 so the distribution is leptokurtic which means that compared to a normal distribution its tails are longer and fatter and its central peak is higher and sharper high uranium concentrations observed in groundwater samples of the study region may be due to local natural geology industrial activities in the region or the use of phosphate fertilizers in huge quantities for agriculture purposes but overall it seems that the plausible source of high uranium observed may be geogenic in nature the high concentrations of uranium in the tosham kharkari makhwan and khanak regions are due to the presence of uranium rich granites and felsic volcanic rock formations of the aravalli group of rocks malani suite of volcanic and alwar quartzites of the delhi system kochhar 1983 1989 2000 the alluvium aquifers of the study region are composed of sand silt kankar and gravel and these aquifers are semi confined similar to the other alluvium aquifers in northwest india such as punjab and rajasthan bonsor et al 2017 many studies coyte et al 2018 duggal et al 2017 sharma et al 2019 bajwa et al 2017 have reported uranium concentrations above 30 μg l 1 in the states of punjab and rajasthan which are associated primarily with alluvial aquifers the findings of these studies are consistent with our results which find high uranium concentrations in groundwater from alluvial aquifers mann et al 2018 reported high activity concentrations of 226ra 232th and 40k in soil samples collected from the sirsa fatehabad hisar and bhiwani districts of haryana 4 2 comparison of uranium concentrations with other studies the observed concentrations were also compared with the worldwide literature table 3 the uranium concentrations in water samples from northern rajasthan haryana and karnataka states of india and pakistan are comparable with the present study however the uranium concentrations are higher in the drinking water of sw punjab india ne portugal southern finland and middle korea whereas the uranium concentrations in the usa nigeria australia greece bangladesh korea ghana fujian province china jammu and kashmir himachal pradesh uttarakhand uttar pradesh bihar jharkhand west bengal chhattisgarh odisha maharashtra tamilnadu andhra pradesh and kerala states of india are lower than the concentrations found in the present study 4 3 depth profile of uranium in groundwater the groundwater samples were collected from different depths to study the vertical distribution of uranium concentration to investigate possible connections between uranium concentration and depth of groundwater fig 2 the values of the first quartile third quartile and interquartile ranges iqr were 5 8 39 and 33 2 μg l 1 respectively for the shallow groundwater sources of depth 50 m for the depth range of 50 100 m the values of the first quartile and third quartiles are 7 3 and 18 μg l 1 respectively giving a large iqr of 10 7 μg l 1 the values of the first quartile third quartile and iqr are 4 95 15 and 10 05 μg l 1 respectively for deep sources of depth 100 m the mean concentration of uranium 33 16 μg l 1 from shallow groundwater sources 50 m is nearly 3 6 times the mean concentration 9 31 μg l 1 from deep groundwater sources 100 m the week negative correlation between uranium and depth r 0 19 indicating that drilling deeper hand pumps can assess groundwater with lower uranium concentrations the results obtained from the study area indicates that the uranium concentration varies primarily due to recharge and discharge the rainfall recharge increases the groundwater level which in turn increases the uranium concentration in groundwater the recharging water reacts with the weathered rocks in the unsaturated zone and the leached out uranium increases uranium concentration in groundwater however as the recharge continues the concentration of uranium in groundwater begins to reduce due to dilution by comparatively fresh recharging water the uranium concentration in groundwater of the study area increases from recharge northeast to discharge area southwest 4 4 correlation between uranium and physicochemical parameters the physicochemical parameters ph tds and ec of the groundwater samples are reported in table 2 and table s1 the groundwater in the study area is alkaline the acceptable limit for ph as prescribed by bis 2012 and who 2011 is 6 5 8 5 four water samples have a ph value above 8 5 the who 2011 has suggested that water ph has no direct impact on consumers activity increases the capacity of water to attack geological materials and leach toxic metals into the water making it potentially harmful for human consumption the results showed that tds value in approximately 89 5 and 40 of the samples exceeded the bis 2012 allowed limit of 500 mg l 1 and permissible limit of 2000 mg l 1 the results showed that ec value in 89 5 of the samples exceeded the water act 1956 maximum permissible limit of 1000 μs cm 1 and 77 of the samples exceeded the who 1993 guideline value of 1500 μs cm 1 no significant correlation was observed between uranium and ph table 4 the positive correlation of uranium with tds r 0 41 suggested that this parameter influences and controls the mobility of uranium in groundwater many studies reported the groundwater with high concentrations of dissolved solids is generally the most radioactive ortega et al 1996 singh et al 2003 duggal et al 2016 2017 4 5 age dependent annual effective dose aed the calculated annual effective dose due to intake of uranium through drinking water for various age groups ranged between 1 1 and 753 μsv y 1 with an average value of 47 μsv y 1 table 5 the who 2011 guidelines fourth edition and the european union council directive 2013 prescribed the measurement of reference dose level rdl of the aed received from drinking water ingestion at 100 μsv y 1 this rdl is 4 2 of the average aed of 2 4 msv y 1 from natural background radiation who 2011 unscear 2008 even though infants consume less water than other age groups the aed is significantly higher in infants than in other age groups because of the differences in infants metabolism and smaller organ weights resulting in higher doses for many radionuclides duggal et al 2017 the aed is slightly higher for the 7 12 months age group of infants as compared to the 0 6 months due to higher annual water intake due to the lower water ingestion rate all the age groups of females receive lower aeds as compared to males the higher aeds during the lactation and pregnancy periods may be attributed to the need for more water in those periods the results showed that eleven samples exceeded the reference level of 100 μsv y 1 for male adults 4 6 radiological toxicity risk the results of cancer mortality risk and cancer morbidity risk are presented in table 6 the estimated mean values of cancer mortality and cancer morbidity risks were lower than the permissible limit of 1 67 10 4 as prescribed by aerb 2004 some studies have reported 10 3 as the acceptable level for radiological risk tran et al 2000 kim et al 2004 under indian conditions the concentration of uranium that poses the carcinogenic risk would be equal to 115 μg l 1 and this high level of uranium was found in four samples birhi kalan b 20 bhiwani city b 60 gendawas b 73 and milakpur b 105 table s2 in supplementary material therefore the long term intake of groundwater from these sites may stochastically increase carcinogenic risk through internal radiation exposure based on maximum uranium concentrations it can be concluded that due to continuous exposure to uranium through consumption of groundwater there could be the occurrence of 44 cancer cases per one lac of the population the values of cancer mortality risk are comparable to those reported in northern rajasthan india 3 7 10 6 to 2 5 10 4 by duggal et al 2017 uttarakhand state india 5 04 10 8 to 1 79 10 4 by prasad et al 2019 punjab state india 1 34 10 6 to 1 80 10 3 by saini et al 2016 sonipat district haryana 2 60 10 5 to 4 39 10 4 and panipat district haryana 4 2 10 5 to 3 49 10 4 by daulta et al 2018 4 7 chemical toxicity risk the lifetime average daily dose ladd of uranium due to ingestion of groundwater ranged between 0 03 and 8 57 μg kg 1 day 1 and the hq accordingly has the same numerical values because rfd is unity who 2011 table 6 approximately 23 5 of the samples showed a hazard quotient greater than unity table s2 in the supplementary material indicating a significant risk due to the chemical toxicity of uranium the kidney is considered to be the main target organ for the chemical toxicity of uranium uranium accumulates in the renal tubular epithelium and causes cellular necrosis and atrophy in the tubular wall leading to decreased reabsorption of amino acids and small proteins by the renal tubules leggett 1989 therefore periodic monitoring and management are needed for these areas the ladd observed in the present study is comparable to those reported in northern rajasthan india 0 07 4 89 μg kg 1 day 1 by duggal et al 2017 uttarakhand state india 0 001 3 69 μg kg 1 day 1 by prasad et al 2019 jammu district jammu kashmir india 0 01 1 52 μg kg 1 day 1 by kumar et al 2016 sonipat district haryana 0 616 10 383 μg kg 1 day 1 and panipat district haryana 0 998 8 259 μg kg 1 day 1 by daulta et al 2018 5 conclusions the results show that 24 8 of the samples exceeded the who pgv the uranium concentration in groundwater varies primarily due to recharge and discharge which would have dissolved or leached the uranium from the weathered soil to the groundwater the positive correlation between tds and uranium in groundwater suggests that tds influences the mobility of uranium in groundwater the mean aeds for all age groups were well below the recommended rdl of 100 μsv y 1 the infants have received relatively high mean aeds compared to other age groups the mean values of cancer mortality risk and cancer morbidity risk were well below the aerb s permissible limit approximately 21 of the samples showed hq 1 indicating chemical toxicity due to the presence of uranium in groundwater therefore unsuitable for drinking remedial action is required at sampling sites

11951,saltwater intrusion into coastal freshwater aquifers is a threat to groundwater quality globally this study aims to determine the extent of saltwater intrusion into the coastal freshwater aquifer of the eastern dahomey basin edb nigeria groundwater chemistry was sampled and analysed for ionic ratios and interpreted using a hydrochemical facie evolution diagram hfe d the saltwater mixing index smi and the groundwater quality index for saltwater intrusion gqiswi high ec and tds and the concentration of dissolved ions showed increased salinity as a result of seawater intrusion in wells located around communities in seme lekki eleko okun ajah ode mahin and igbokoda correlation of ions in the wet season also suggests higher salinities which originate partly from industrial and municipal effluents especially from wells which are close to river channels while dry season groundwater shows the dominant influence of seawater intrusion hfe d revealed that mixed groundwater of na ca hco3 na cl and ca cl dominate the area due to gravity driven flow leading to groundwater freshening inland from the coastline towards the northern part of the basin the groundwater quality index from smi and gqiswi shows areas within 3 km from the coastline that are more sensitive to saltwater intrusion based on abstraction rate and depth of the wells the present study provides information of value to planners and policy makers for the sustainable management and protection of coastal groundwater resources in the eastern dahomey basin graphical abstract image 1 keywords saltwater intrusion groundwater quality index freshwater and coastal aquifer 1 introduction coastal aquifers around the world are at risk of increasing salinity resulting from saltwater intrusion rapid growth in urbanisation population and the associated over abstraction of groundwater in coastal regions has worsened the situation mapping the intrusion and extent of saltwater coverage or mixing zones is difficult and costly due to the hydrogeologic complexity the multifaceted nature of the problem and the high cost of drilling multiple level wells needed for detailed study custodio 2005 nigeria the most populous nation in africa has some of its largest cities on the southwestern coast ukhurebor and abiodun 2018 the high population density has resulted in over abstraction of groundwater from the fragile coastal aquifer and the proximity to the sea has led to a saltwater intrusion into the coastal freshwater aquifer studies have shown that saline groundwater can lead to severe problems for water supply especially under heavy groundwater abstraction tirkey et al 2017 seawater intrusion is a widespread problem of coastal aquifers associated with urbanisation han et al 2016 oteri and atolagbe 2003 longe et al 1987 adepelumi et al 2009 adeoti et al 2010 ayolabi et al 2013 and talabi et al 2012 these studies identified saline water in some boreholes and wells especially at the upper aquifer in part of lagos some of the locations experiencing saline water intrusion include the eastern coast of lagos such as lekki ajjah victoria island and coastal communities in ondo state such as aiyetoro ugbonla mahin and igbokoda the origin of saltwater was linked to the incursion of seawater from the ocean during the flooding of canals and dissolved evaporites trapped within the aquifers sediments adelana et al 1996 observed that deterioration of water quality in the coastal zones of lekki phase 1 and oniru environs of lagos metropolis is due to saltwater intrusion which was of concern among the owner of properties in the vicinity they also found several boreholes constructed in naira were abandoned due to saline water intrusion cities underlying by the eastern dahomey basin like other coastal cities in the world rely heavily on the groundwater resources as one source of potable water for domestic industrial and agricultural purposes to complement the erratic pipe borne water supply there are a few specific sites hydrogeological studies of the area within the basin especially approaching the border with lagos longe et al 1987 oteri and atolagbe 2003 longe and balogun 2010 while few or none have looked at hydrogeological processes across the entire basin to study the relative distribution and extent of saline intrusion and its effect on groundwater quality these aquifers constitute a vital source of freshwater in the regions and with the continuous increase in water demand there is vital need to monitor the risk of saline water intrusion as once this problem occurs it is difficult to remediate a long term water resource management strategy is needed which will require investment less than 2 of seawater intrusion in the freshwater can diminish the water s potability according to custodio 2005 presently there is no groundwater monitoring well within this basin necessary for routine saltwater intrusion monitoring assessment of major ions is vital to identify the source of determination of water quality saha et al 2018 the chemical composition of groundwater changes as it flows through geologic media so full chemical analysis is useful to identify a saltwater intrusion saha et al 2019 seddique et al 2019 this study employed hydrochemical methods using selected groundwater indices and ionic ratios to fingerprint saline water intrusion in

for sustainable groundwater resources management in this coastal zone in the face of both anthropogenic and natural drivers such as climate change 1 1 study area and geomorphology the eastern dahomey basin lies in the southwestern part of nigeria fig 1 it is a transboundary basin that extends from ghana through togo and benin to nigeria this basin is bounded by okitipupa ridge which is the boundary it shares with niger delta basin jones and hockey 1964 it lies between latitudes 2041 10 00 4 59 5900 n and longitudes 6 21 1300 7 52 42 00 e along the coast of the gulf of guinea the basin is bounded in the south by the atlantic ocean and thin out at the north by the precambrian basement rocks the area of investigation is undulated at the north and flatting in to plane towards the ocean with several points virtually at or below the sea level the highest elevation is observed around abeokuta eastern dahomey basin is characterised by two distinct seasons wet and dry the wet season occurs between april and october with a break in august and features average rainfall which ranges from 1800 mm 2500 mm while the dry season lasts from november to april ukhurebor and abiodun 2018 the major rivers ogun ose and oluwa drain the basin into the delta and to the atlantic ocean the basin hosts two major administrative water basins authorities in nigeria and the ogun osun and benin owena river basins and accommodates about 40 population of the country residence including the metropolitan city of lagos the study area is vital to the economy of nigeria and west africa 1 2 geology and hydrogeology of eastern dahomey basin the lithological character of the sediments is formed by a regime of transgressions and regressions of the sea since the cretaceous era these transgressions come from the south the stratigraphic description of the sediments has been provided by various authors including jones and hockey 1964 adegoke and omatsola 1981 elueze and nton 2004 odukoya et al 2013 oteri and atolagbe 2003 ako et al 1980 billman 1976 kennedy 2012 fayose 1970 jones and hockey 1964 summarised in table 1 and presented in fig 2 the oligocene to recent alluvium deposits and coastal plain sands consist of soft very poorly sorted clayey sands pebbly sands sandy clays and rare thin lignite reyment 1965 this is underlain by ilaro formation which consists of massive yellowish poorly consolidated cross bedded sandstones which are fine medium grained and poorly sorted kogbe 1976 this layer is followed by ewekoro formation which consists of predominantly paleocene fossiliferous limestone that becomes arenaceous towards the base reyment 1965 and below the abeokuta formation consists of lower cretaceous sandstone and grits with interbedded mudstone unconformity overlaying the basement complex fine detrital sandstone siltstone and shale the coastal plains sands represents the main aquifer in the southern parts of the edb in which most of the wells and boreholes extract water this is a multi aquifer system consisting of three aquifer horizons separated by silty or clayey layers longe et al 1987 the aquifer shows high thickness at the northern part of abeokuta through ewekoro ilaro and thin out at the coast the percentage composition of sands in lithology also increases towards the coast longe et al 1987 longe et al 1987 characterised coastal plain and alluvium deposits into different units the first is an unconfined water table aquifer prone to pollution the second and third are confined aquifers composed of an alternating sequence of sand and clay they are tapped by boreholes as the basis of mini water works in lagos area these aquifers belong to the continental ilaro formation the third aquifer appears to be the most productive facies with a high level of groundwater exploitation as most production terminates in this unit this aquifer is in an under confined to semi confined condition longe et al 1987 adelana et al 1996 longe 2011 generally the piezometric surface ranges from 2 0 to 15 0 m below ground level b g l in the area also the study area is well drained by rivers and streams that flow into the lagoon and the atlantic ocean the average annual precipitation is above 1700 mm and serves as a primary source of groundwater recharge 2 materials and method 2 1 field physicochemical measurement and groundwater sampling a topographical map of the study area was gridded to determine accessible locations within the area in which to carry out a systematic and representative groundwater sampling physicochemical measurements of electrical conductivity ec ph total dissolved solids tds salinity redox potential eh and temperature were measured and recorded in the field using model 99 720 microprocessor ph conductivity meter a total of 229 water samples were collected from shallow boreholes and hand dug wells 96 in the dry season and 133 in the wet season across the eastern dahomey basin the samples were collected in three separate polyethene bottles labelled a b and is samples labelled a were acidified to a ph 2 after collection with 0 4 ml of concentrated nitric acid hno3 samples b and is were filtered with a 0 45 μm filter and preserved in an ice packed cooler to keep samples temperature below 4 c before being transported to the laboratory for further analysis 2 2 laboratory analysis cations and anions analyses were carried out using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes and ion chromatography ic with standard methods after filtering with 0 45 μm alkalinity and bicarbonate were determined using hach digital titrator using bromocresol green methyl red and phenolphthalein indicator using 0 16 and 1 6 m of sulphuric acid results were checked for error using calculated error equations recommended by adelana et al 1996 2 3 data quality control quality control was conducted on hydrochemical laboratory results of the ions using ionic balance using sum of cations versus the sum of anions about 75 of the samples fall within 5 acceptable error limit as described in adelana et al 1996 with 12 dry season and 19 wet season samples recorded above this threshold total dissolved solids tds and calculated total dissolved ions tdi were plotted on a scatter diagram and showed a correlation of 0 78 and 0 86 respectively for both wet and dry seasons the values are both below the limits recommended for hydrochemical analysis by the world meterological organization wmo in 1994 2 4 data evaluation and analysis 2 4 1 theoretical background 1 hfe diagram approach the hydrochemical facies evolution diagram hfe d proposed by gimenez forcada 2010 provides a simple way to identify the state of a coastal aquifer with respect to intrusion freshening phases as identiﬁed by the distribution of anion and cation percentages as presented in fig 4 the hfe d uses only the percentage of the major cations ca2 and na and anions hco3 so4 2 and cl to determine the dynamics of saline saltwater intrusion the authors suggest conventional diagrams such as the piper diagram do not allow for full recognition of the facies evolution sequence during recharge and intrusion events therefore gimenez forcada 2010 suggested that the hfe d diagram is more informative for this purpose this diagram is well explained in amiri et al 2016 2 groundwater quality index for saltwater intrusion gqiswi this method accounts for hydrochemical processes associated with saltwater intrusion and is explained using graphical methods like the piper diagram and chaddah or hydrochemical facies evolution diagram as these graphical methods are not georeferenced for use by policymakers the approach of gqiswi is used to simplify multiple non linear processes involving several water quality pollutants into an indicator that can be quantified and spatially referenced into a single map tomaszkiewicz et al 2014 singhal and gupta 2010 edet 2016 and amiri et al 2016 all successfully applied this method in their studies gqiswi is numerically derived as shown in equations below gqication 1 n a k 50 if ca 50 or 1 1 m g 50 if ca 50 gqianion 1 c o 3 h c o 3 25 if

saltwater mixing index smi proposed by park and aral 2008 is based on the work of aniekan edet 2016 and used to estimate the relative degree of saltwater brackish water mixing with freshwater smi value can be computed as follows 5 smi a c n a t n a b c m g t m g c c c l t c l d c s o 4 t s o 4 where letters a b c and d represent the relative degree concentration proportion of ions such as na mg cl and so4 in seawater respectively where a 0 31 b 0 04 c 0 57 d 0 08 c is the measured concentration in mg l of the ions in groundwater the letter t represents the regional threshold values estimated from the interpretation of the probability curves as shown by edet 2016 from the regional results in this study the computed threshold values for na mg cl and so4 were 107 18 4 218 and 37 9 mg l respectively smi for each sample is computed using the calculated threshold values if the smi is greater than 1 the water is said to be affected by seawater mixing edet 2016 3 1 data processing and statistical analysis geochemist workbench student edition 12 0 and gw chart by the usgs were used to plot data and determination of water type from the hydrochemical results descriptive statistics and pearson s correlation coefficient between the physicochemical parameters were carried out using spss and microsoft origin pro the correlation coefficient r value ranges between 1 and 1 provide an insight into the relationship between the pairs of the physicochemical parameters pearson s correlation coefficient value lies between 1 to 1 and the degree of correlation is said to be a perfect correlation if the correlation coefficient value is near 1 for values ranging between 0 75 and 1 is considered a high degree of correlation similarly a moderate degree of correlation for values between 0 25 and 0 75 and a low degree of correlation for values between 0 and 0 25 and vice vasa for the negative correlation values kumar et al 2011 a correlation matrix was carried out on the data set from the two seasons separately 3 1 1 gis approach results of the calculated numerical indices and water types were plotted on the map of the study area using arcgis version 10 60 after converting the imported csv files to shapefiles and then plotted on a study area map extracted from a global administrative boundary map downloaded from the diva gis website the maps present the georeferenced spatial distribution of the electrical conductivities water type and groundwater quality index for saltwater intrusion gqiswi 4 results and discussions 4 1 groundwater chemical analysis the physical and chemical characteristics of groundwater samples from the shallow boreholes and hand dug wells during wet june to july 2017 and dry february to march 2018 seasons within eastern dahomey basin edb coastal aquifer in nigeria are presented in table 2 and fig 3 total dissolved solids tds varies from below detection bd in rainwater to 8500 of the seawater from the gulf of guinea coast with an average of 201 8 mg l in the wet season in the dry season samples tds ranges from 2 3 to 9300 mg l with an average of 233 mg l the increase in tds during the dry season samples could be attributed to the effect of evaporation which encourages increase in mineral concentrations in groundwater compared to the dilution process driven by precipitation in the wet season similarly electrical conductivity ec see table 2 of the groundwater is higher in the dry season compared to the wet season major ions in groundwater such as cl na so4 and mg2 are used as an indication of saltwater intrusion into freshwater aquifer and are presented in table 2 the concentration of cl ranges from 0 1 to 18 970 mg l with an average value of 218 mg l in wet season samples while those from the dry season range from 0 9 mg l to 19 230 mg l with an average value of 32 mg l chloride concentration shows a slight increase in concentration during the dry season the concentration of na ranges from 0 1 to 8857 mg l and 0 6 to 9420 mg l with an average of 107 and 104 mg l for wet and dry seasons respectively the correlation coefficient between chloride and sodium tables 3 a and 3b in the wet season r 0 01 compared to dry season r 0 98 indicate the diverse source of chloride which could be attributed to anthropogenic contribution possibly effluent from sewage or leachates longe and balogun 2010 e a ayolabi et al 2013 lapworth et al 2017 we cannot discount the impact of precipitation and evaporation which causes mineral precipitation from the seawater and halite which characterised the dry season however the concentrations of sodium and chloride are far below equilibrium halite saturation so4 2 concentration ranges from 0 1 to 2211 mg l with an average of 245 mg l in the wet season and 0 3 576 mg l and the average concentration of 17 6 mg l in groundwater samples collected during the dry season mg2 concentration ranges from 0 04 to 1377 mg l with an average value of 18 4 mg l in the wet season and 0 1 1416 mg l with an average concentration of 18 6 mg l in the dry season high correlation of so4 with cl r 1 0 and conversely low correlation r 0 05 with na and the relatively high correlation between cl and no3 r 0 60 further affirm the anthropogenic influence see tables 3a and 3b most of the increases observed in cl na mg and so4 occurred in locations within the proximity of the sea cl also shows higher correlation with all the major ions except no3 in water samples from dry season this could be attributed to the effect of salinisation resulted from saltwater intrusion and evaporation dissolution with dominant na cl and ca cl water type see tables 4 a and 4b 4 2 groundwater characterisation using hef diagram the hydrochemical facies evolution diagram hfe d developed by giménez forcada et al 2010 was employed in this study the method has been used by several authors namely charette and allen 2006 wu et al 2010 li et al 2015 amiri et al 2016 han et al 2016 and shi et al 2018 and provides a simple way to identify the state of the coastal aquifer with respect to intrusion freshening phases the processes are identified by the distribution of anions and cations percentages in the square diagram fig 5 in the hfe diagram four main facies are recognised which include na cl sea saltwater ca hco3 natural freshwater ca cl salinised water with reverse cation exchange and na hco3 salinised water with direct cation exchange fig 5 the facies explained two almost simultaneous processes which occur during the intrusion stage of saltwater into freshwater the facies types located above and to the left of the conservative mixing line are representative of the freshening phase whereas facies types situated below and to the right of the line characterise the sea saltwater intrusion phase facies types located in the centre of hfe diagram can be considered as a mixing phase for both fresh and saltwater representing the transformation phase for either freshening or intrusion phases in the intrusion and freshening fields various sub steps can be identified following the salinity evolution through the cl percentage the freshening sub steps include f 1 f 2 f 3 f 4 and fw representative of freshwater composition in this diagram the intrusion sub steps related to the sea saltwater intrusion phase are represented as i 1 i 2 i 3 i 4 and sw representative sea saltwater composition during the recharge of the aquifer the groundwater is said to be in the freshening phase with f4 with dominant ca hco3 in the inland towards the northern parts of the basin bounded by the precambrian rock which is unconformably overlain by the oldest abeokuta formation groundwater aquifer this facies is gradually transforming to mixed ca na hco3 rock this begins from an initial state because the aquifer contains kaolinite which releases more na ions into the groundwater to form a mixed water of facies f 3 mixna mixhco3 ca mixhco3 and mix as the water continues to flow within the basin the groundwater gradually transforms to f 2 mixna mixcl probably due to the influence of sea spraying and possible effluents from the industries as the industrial activities increase towards the same trend as groundwater flow down south finally the f 1 facies represents water type which has experienced influence of saltwater intrusion and is mostly close to the coastline see fig 4a b na cl water type dominates the coastal plain sands and alluvium deposits aquifer and some locations along river channels and lagoon especially in the rainy season a summary of water types is shown in tables 4a and 4b while fig 4a and b shows their spatial distribution across edb for both wet and dry season respectively finally the intrusion process salinisation of the aquifer is reduced as the freshening increases northward towards the inland of the basin 4 3 ionic ratio ionic ratios have been used to evaluate seawater intrusion in coastal areas at different locations around the world custodio 2005 khaska et al 2012 li et al 2015 katz et al 2010 aniekan edet 2016 the ionic ratio of water samples for both wet and dry season in the basin are presented in table 5 tables 6 a and 6b contain the correlation between ec saltwater mixing index smi and these ratios these ratios are considered to be a good indicator of seawater intrusion they include na ca2 ca2 cl na ca2 cl hco3 mg cl ca so4 so4 cl and cl br the ratio mg2 cl shows moderate positive correlation r 0 946 with na cl in the wet season and r 0 919 in the dry season this correlation indicates seawater mixed in groundwater for both seasons the cl br in groundwater ranges from 4 46 to 346 wet and 6 45 to 460 dry with an average of 170 and 49 respectively there is a weak correlation between ec and cl br tables 6a and 6b with r 0 192 and 0 297 for the wet and dry seasons respectively higher correlation values between ec and cl br in water samples during the dry season indicates more influence of seawater in the dry as compared to the wet season this is confirmed by ec and smi correlation which is 0 516 in the wet season and 0 931 in the dry season this process suggests chloride in the groundwater in the wet season is more from non seawater sources e g effluent while the groundwater in the dry season has more influence of seawater the ratios of na cl showed significant correlation with ec r 0 73 see tables 6a and 6b in the wet season and very weak r 0 070 in the dry season which also confirmed the earlier statement 4 3 1 revelle coefficient cl co3 hco3 ratio the revelle coefficient cl co3 hco3 ratio has been used as a criterion to evaluate the saltwater intrusion in previous groundwater studies abdalla 2016 edet 2016 kumar et al 2010 chloride is one of the dominant ions in seawater and mostly occurs in small amounts in groundwater hco3 is usually the most abundant negative ion in groundwater while it occurs in low concentration in seawater the ration of these anions is used as a measure of the degree of contamination of freshwater by saltwater the classification is shown in table 7 in this study 55 2 and 45 9 of the sampled groundwater fell into the category of good quality water with respect to cl hco3 ratio for wet and dry seasons respectively while 39 6 and 42 9 of the samples showed slight seawater influence for the respective season seawater influence was observed on 2 25 of the samples from the dry season and 0 from the wet season the highest seawater impact is observed in water samples from wells located around okun ajjah ode mahin and gbetomey these are less than 500 m from the coastline except ode mahin which is within 100 m from the sea lagoon only one sample collected showed extreme influence expected from seawater this result further confirms the applicability of this method in the evaluation of groundwater quality with regard to saltwater intrusion narany et al 2014 comparing the results of the wet season with the dry season there is a slightly higher intrusion in the dry season which could be attributed to over abstraction of groundwater when common rain harvesting stopped while dilution could be responsible for low salinity in the wet season table 7 chloride concentration was classified into fresh fresh brackish brackish brackish salt salt and hyperhaline as shown in table 8 the results revealed 97 92 and 95 5 water fall within the freshwater class for wet and dry seasons respectively this method only shows the slight effect of seasonal variation on saltwater intrusion with 1 0 and 0 7 which represent the only sample collected from the sea as the saltwater among the samples while 2 3 of the dry season groundwater samples indicate brackish salt water compared to 0 of the wet season 4 4 assessment of intrusion using saltwater mixing index smi the seawater mixing index smi which was proposed by par et al 2005 was also employed in this study to further assess the groundwater of the eastern dahomey basin with respect to seawater pollution the results of this method are presented in table 9 the results show that 96 9 and 93 2 per cent of the groundwater samples from both wet and dry seasons fall within a freshwater category with smi values below 1 0 while 1 1 and 2 3 of respective wet and dry season samples areslightly polluted based on smi with values falling between 1 0 and 2 0 2 08 and 3 0 of wet and dry season water samples revealed smi values between 10 0 and 150 0 which indicate dangerously polluted groundwater with saltwater intrusion this represents the groundwater from gbetomey in badagary ogombo okun ajjah and ode mahin in the wet and dry season in addition to those mentioned earlier the isheri and adesanya areas near lekki during the dry season samples also revealed high smi values this is also supported by the moderate to high correlation value between smi ec and cl hco3 with a correlation coefficient of 0 51 and 0 88 table 6a in the wet season while smi ec and na cl revealed correlation values of 0 93 and 0 50 but low correlation value of 0 02 with cl hco3 in the dry season samples table 6b the variation in these correlation could be artributed to effect of sea spraying which salt dissolution in precipitation in the wet season and evaporationconcentration mineral dissolution in the dry season vengosh and rosenthal 1994 abimbola et al 1999 edet 2019 4 5 groundwater quality index in relation to saltwater intrusion the aquifer monitoring and vulnerability maps for saltwater intrusion were prepared based on calculations of gqiswi and hfe diagrams for both wet and dry seasons based on gqiswi method as presented in tables 10 and 11 the spatial distribution maps fig 6 revealed that the study area is dominated by freshwater in both wet mean gqiswi 21 0 and dry seasons mean gqiswi 70 4 however some fingerprint of saltwater intrusion was identified in both seasons in locations along the coastline due to their proximity to the gulf of guinea saline water was identified in some locations far inland into the basin especially along the rivers during the wet season low correlation of na and cl r 0 01 in wet season and a conversely high value r 0 98 implies a different origin of cl in groundwater higher correlation of cl with no3 r 0 60 in the wet season suggests anthropogenic influence which could be attributed to high recharge and soil saturation rate while a relatively low correlation value r 0 25 between cl and no3 suggests geogenic sources of seawater intrusion and evapoconcentration in the dry season a few boreholes within 500 m of the coastline located at the south central to the southwestern part within the coastal plain sand and alluvium deposit show relatively higher salinity this higher salinity is suspected to be an indication of a saltwater intrusion processes such as over abstraction of water from the shallow aquifer flooding triggered by sea level rise due to climate change and effluence from domestic and municipal waste might contribute to future increases in the salinity of groundwater within this basin aladejana et al 2020 total evaporation with precipitation of halite minerals along the riverbed has been reported in a few areas e a e a ayolabi et al 2013 odukoya et al 2013 it is important to note that halite is not considered a major source of salinity as freshwater predominates the areas along the coastline where most of the shallow wells tap the unconfined aquifer that is directly recharged by the precipitation the gqiswi show mixed groundwater types as predominant groundwater across the eastern dahomey basin this predomination of mixed groundwater type based on gqiswi is also supported by the hydrochemical facies evolution diagram hfe d earlier presented in fig 5 the mixing characteristics observed across this basin could be attributed to the nature geology of the basin through rock water interaction and also to topography gravity driven flow generally in a north south direction fig 6 5 conclusion in this study saltwater intrusion into the freshwater aquifer of the eastern dahomey basin southwestern nigeria was monitored using a seasonal hydrochemical quality index and ionic ratios such as hfe d smi and gqiswi and ionic ratio such as cl br cl hco3 that are used to evaluate seawater intrusion pearson correlation analysis physicochemical parameters especially na ca2 mg2 cl hco3 and so4 2 and ec values revealed the influence of seawater intrusion in some of the water samples from wells that are relatively deeper within the proximity of the coastline of seme lekki eleko okun ajjah ode mahin and igbokoda it further revealed the anthropogenic influence of industrial and municipal effluent especially in samples from wells within the alluvium deposit which are generally closer to the river channels flood plain results of hfe d ionic ratios smi and gqiswi revealed that mixed groundwater of na ca hco3 and na cl dominate the area due to gravity driven flow spatial distribution of groundwater revealed freshening which increases inland from the coastline towards the northern part of the basin results of the groundwater quality index confirmed this and identified few locations of saline water around lekki okun ajjah and the ode mahin in both wet and dry seasons most sampled boreholes show freshwater during the wet season above the units

11951,saltwater intrusion into coastal freshwater aquifers is a threat to groundwater quality globally this study aims to determine the extent of saltwater intrusion into the coastal freshwater aquifer of the eastern dahomey basin edb nigeria groundwater chemistry was sampled and analysed for ionic ratios and interpreted using a hydrochemical facie evolution diagram hfe d the saltwater mixing index smi and the groundwater quality index for saltwater intrusion gqiswi high ec and tds and the concentration of dissolved ions showed increased salinity as a result of seawater intrusion in wells located around communities in seme lekki eleko okun ajah ode mahin and igbokoda correlation of ions in the wet season also suggests higher salinities which originate partly from industrial and municipal effluents especially from wells which are close to river channels while dry season groundwater shows the dominant influence of seawater intrusion hfe d revealed that mixed groundwater of na ca hco3 na cl and ca cl dominate the area due to gravity driven flow leading to groundwater freshening inland from the coastline towards the northern part of the basin the groundwater quality index from smi and gqiswi shows areas within 3 km from the coastline that are more sensitive to saltwater intrusion based on abstraction rate and depth of the wells the present study provides information of value to planners and policy makers for the sustainable management and protection of coastal groundwater resources in the eastern dahomey basin graphical abstract image 1 keywords saltwater intrusion groundwater quality index freshwater and coastal aquifer 1 introduction coastal aquifers around the world are at risk of increasing salinity resulting from saltwater intrusion rapid growth in urbanisation population and the associated over abstraction of groundwater in coastal regions has worsened the situation mapping the intrusion and extent of saltwater coverage or mixing zones is difficult and costly due to the hydrogeologic complexity the multifaceted nature of the problem and the high cost of drilling multiple level wells needed for detailed study custodio 2005 nigeria the most populous nation in africa has some of its largest cities on the southwestern coast ukhurebor and abiodun 2018 the high population density has resulted in over abstraction of groundwater from the fragile coastal aquifer and the proximity to the sea has led to a saltwater intrusion into the coastal freshwater aquifer studies have shown that saline groundwater can lead to severe problems for water supply especially under heavy groundwater abstraction tirkey et al 2017 seawater intrusion is a widespread problem of coastal aquifers associated with urbanisation han et al 2016 oteri and atolagbe 2003 longe et al 1987 adepelumi et al 2009 adeoti et al 2010 ayolabi et al 2013 and talabi et al 2012 these studies identified saline water in some boreholes and wells especially at the upper aquifer in part of lagos some of the locations experiencing saline water intrusion include the eastern coast of lagos such as lekki ajjah victoria island and coastal communities in ondo state such as aiyetoro ugbonla mahin and igbokoda the origin of saltwater was linked to the incursion of seawater from the ocean during the flooding of canals and dissolved evaporites trapped within the aquifers sediments adelana et al 1996 observed that deterioration of water quality in the coastal zones of lekki phase 1 and oniru environs of lagos metropolis is due to saltwater intrusion which was of concern among the owner of properties in the vicinity they also found several boreholes constructed in naira were abandoned due to saline water intrusion cities underlying by the eastern dahomey basin like other coastal cities in the world rely heavily on the groundwater resources as one source of potable water for domestic industrial and agricultural purposes to complement the erratic pipe borne water supply there are a few specific sites hydrogeological studies of the area within the basin especially approaching the border with lagos longe et al 1987 oteri and atolagbe 2003 longe and balogun 2010 while few or none have looked at hydrogeological processes across the entire basin to study the relative distribution and extent of saline intrusion and its effect on groundwater quality these aquifers constitute a vital source of freshwater in the regions and with the continuous increase in water demand there is vital need to monitor the risk of saline water intrusion as once this problem occurs it is difficult to remediate a long term water resource management strategy is needed which will require investment less than 2 of seawater intrusion in the freshwater can diminish the water s potability according to custodio 2005 presently there is no groundwater monitoring well within this basin necessary for routine saltwater intrusion monitoring assessment of major ions is vital to identify the source of determination of water quality saha et al 2018 the chemical composition of groundwater changes as it flows through geologic media so full chemical analysis is useful to identify a saltwater intrusion saha et al 2019 seddique et al 2019 this study employed hydrochemical methods using selected groundwater indices and ionic ratios to fingerprint saline water intrusion in freshwater the conclusions are expected to be considered as one monitoring tool for the annual assessment of groundwater in the coastal aquifers of the edb the indices used include hydrochemical evolution facies diagram hef diagram groundwater quality index for saltwater intrusion gqiswi and seawater mixing index smi combined with the ionic ratios br cl and cl hco3 and revelle coefficient these methods had proven effective in the work of kennedy 2012 christina and alexandros 2014 amiri et al 2016 and edet 2016 comparing these indices and ratios should support policy for groundwater monitoring for saltwater intrusion the outcomes will add to available information and knowledge on the saltwater intrusion of the coastal freshwater aquifer of the edb this information is necessary for sustainable groundwater resources management in this coastal zone in the face of both anthropogenic and natural drivers such as climate change 1 1 study area and geomorphology the eastern dahomey basin lies in the southwestern part of nigeria fig 1 it is a transboundary basin that extends from ghana through togo and benin to nigeria this basin is bounded by okitipupa ridge which is the

is bounded in the south by the atlantic ocean and thin out at the north by the precambrian basement rocks the area of investigation is undulated at the north and flatting in to plane towards the ocean with several points virtually at or below the sea level the highest elevation is observed around abeokuta eastern dahomey basin is characterised by two distinct seasons wet and dry the wet season occurs between april and october with a break in august and features average rainfall which ranges from 1800 mm 2500 mm while the dry season lasts from november to april ukhurebor and abiodun 2018 the major rivers ogun ose and oluwa drain the basin into the delta and to the atlantic ocean the basin hosts two major administrative water basins authorities in nigeria and the ogun osun and benin owena

from the south the stratigraphic description of the sediments has been provided by various authors including jones and hockey 1964 adegoke and omatsola 1981 elueze and nton 2004 odukoya et al 2013 oteri and atolagbe 2003 ako et al 1980 billman 1976 kennedy 2012 fayose 1970 jones and hockey 1964 summarised in table 1 and presented in fig 2 the oligocene to recent alluvium deposits and coastal plain sands consist of soft very poorly sorted clayey sands pebbly sands sandy clays and rare thin lignite reyment 1965 this is underlain by ilaro formation which consists of massive yellowish poorly consolidated cross bedded sandstones which are fine medium grained and poorly sorted kogbe 1976 this layer is followed by ewekoro formation which consists of predominantly paleocene fossiliferous limestone that becomes arenaceous towards the base reyment 1965 and below the abeokuta formation consists of lower cretaceous sandstone and grits with interbedded mudstone unconformity overlaying the basement complex fine detrital sandstone siltstone and shale the coastal plains sands represents the main aquifer in the southern parts of the edb in which most of the wells and boreholes extract water this is a multi aquifer system consisting of three aquifer horizons separated by silty or clayey layers longe et al 1987 the aquifer shows high thickness at the northern part of abeokuta through ewekoro ilaro and thin out at the coast the percentage composition of sands in lithology also increases towards the coast longe et al 1987 longe et al 1987 characterised coastal plain and alluvium deposits into different units the first is an unconfined water table aquifer prone to pollution the second and third are confined aquifers composed of an alternating sequence of sand and clay they are tapped by boreholes as the basis of mini water works in lagos area these aquifers belong to the continental ilaro formation the third aquifer appears to be the most productive facies with a high level of groundwater exploitation as most production terminates in this unit this aquifer is in an under confined to semi confined condition longe et al 1987 adelana et al 1996 longe 2011 generally the piezometric surface ranges from 2 0 to 15 0 m below ground level b g l in the area also the study area is well drained by rivers and streams that flow into the lagoon and the atlantic ocean the average annual precipitation is above 1700 mm and serves as a primary source of groundwater recharge 2 materials and method 2 1 field physicochemical measurement and groundwater sampling a topographical map of the study area was gridded to determine accessible locations within the area in which to carry out a systematic and representative groundwater sampling physicochemical measurements of electrical conductivity ec ph total dissolved solids tds salinity redox potential eh and temperature were measured and recorded in the field using model 99 720 microprocessor ph conductivity meter a total of 229 water samples were collected from shallow boreholes and hand dug wells 96 in the dry season and 133 in the wet season across the eastern dahomey basin the samples were collected in three separate polyethene bottles labelled a b and is samples labelled a were acidified to a ph 2 after collection with 0 4 ml of concentrated nitric acid hno3 samples b and is were filtered with a 0 45 μm filter and preserved in an ice packed cooler to keep samples temperature below 4 c before being transported to the laboratory for further analysis 2 2 laboratory analysis cations and anions analyses were carried out using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes and ion chromatography ic with standard methods after filtering with 0 45 μm alkalinity and bicarbonate were determined using hach digital titrator using bromocresol green methyl red and phenolphthalein indicator using 0 16 and 1 6 m of sulphuric acid results were checked for error using calculated error equations recommended by adelana et al 1996 2 3 data quality control quality control was conducted on hydrochemical laboratory results of the ions using ionic balance using sum of cations versus the sum of anions about 75 of the samples fall within 5 acceptable error limit as described in adelana et al 1996 with 12 dry season and 19 wet season samples recorded above this threshold total dissolved solids tds and calculated total dissolved ions tdi were plotted on a scatter diagram and showed a correlation of 0 78 and 0 86 respectively for both wet and dry seasons the values are both below the limits recommended for hydrochemical analysis by the world meterological organization wmo in 1994 2 4 data evaluation and analysis 2 4 1 theoretical background 1 hfe diagram approach the hydrochemical facies evolution diagram hfe d proposed by gimenez forcada 2010 provides a simple way to identify the state of a coastal aquifer with respect to intrusion freshening phases as identiﬁed by the distribution of anion and cation percentages as presented in fig 4 the hfe d uses only the percentage of the major cations ca2 and na and anions hco3 so4 2 and cl to determine the dynamics of saline saltwater intrusion the authors suggest conventional diagrams such as the piper diagram do not allow for full recognition of the facies evolution sequence during recharge and intrusion events therefore gimenez forcada 2010 suggested that the hfe d diagram is more informative for this purpose this diagram is well explained in amiri et al 2016 2 groundwater quality index for saltwater intrusion gqiswi this method accounts for hydrochemical processes associated with saltwater intrusion and is explained using graphical methods like the piper diagram and chaddah or hydrochemical facies evolution diagram as these graphical methods are not georeferenced for use by policymakers the approach of gqiswi is used to simplify multiple non linear processes involving several water quality pollutants into an indicator that can be quantified and spatially referenced into a single map tomaszkiewicz et al 2014 singhal and gupta 2010 edet 2016 and amiri et al 2016 all successfully applied this method in their studies gqiswi is numerically derived as shown in equations below gqication 1 n a k 50 if ca 50 or 1 1 m g 50 if ca 50 gqianion 1 c o 3 h c o 3 25 if

saltwater mixing index smi proposed by park and aral 2008 is based on the work of aniekan edet 2016 and used to estimate the relative degree of saltwater brackish water mixing with freshwater smi value can be computed as follows 5 smi a c n a t n a b c m g t m g c c c l t c l d c s o 4 t s o 4 where letters a b c and d represent the relative degree concentration proportion of ions such as na mg cl and so4 in seawater respectively where a 0 31 b 0 04 c 0 57 d 0 08 c is the measured concentration in mg l of the ions in groundwater the letter t represents the regional threshold values estimated from the interpretation of the probability curves as shown by edet 2016 from the regional results in this study the computed threshold values for na mg cl and so4 were 107 18 4 218 and 37 9 mg l respectively smi for each sample is computed using the calculated threshold values if the smi is greater than 1 the water is said to be affected by seawater mixing edet 2016 3 1 data processing and statistical analysis geochemist workbench student edition 12 0 and gw chart by the usgs were used to plot data and determination of water type from the hydrochemical results descriptive statistics and pearson s correlation coefficient between the physicochemical parameters were carried out using spss and microsoft origin pro the correlation coefficient r value ranges between 1 and 1 provide an insight into the relationship between the pairs of the physicochemical parameters pearson s correlation coefficient value lies between 1 to 1 and the degree of correlation is said to be a perfect correlation if the correlation coefficient value is near 1 for values ranging between 0 75 and 1 is considered a high degree of correlation similarly a moderate degree of correlation for values between 0 25 and 0 75 and a low degree of correlation for values between 0 and 0 25 and vice vasa for the negative correlation values kumar et al 2011 a correlation matrix was carried out on the data set from the two seasons separately 3 1 1 gis approach results of the calculated numerical indices and water types were plotted on the map of the study area using arcgis version 10 60 after converting the imported csv files to shapefiles and then plotted on a study area map extracted from a global administrative boundary map downloaded from the diva gis website the maps present the georeferenced spatial distribution of the electrical conductivities water type and groundwater quality index for saltwater intrusion gqiswi 4 results and discussions 4 1 groundwater chemical analysis the physical and chemical characteristics of groundwater samples from the shallow boreholes and hand dug wells during wet june to july 2017 and dry february to march 2018 seasons within eastern dahomey basin edb coastal aquifer in nigeria are presented in table 2 and fig 3 total dissolved solids tds varies from below detection bd in rainwater to 8500 of the seawater from the gulf of guinea coast with an average of 201 8 mg l in the wet season in the dry season samples tds ranges from 2 3 to 9300 mg l with an average of 233 mg l the increase in tds during the dry season samples could be attributed to the effect of evaporation which encourages increase in mineral concentrations in groundwater compared to the dilution process driven by precipitation in the wet season similarly electrical conductivity ec see table 2 of the groundwater is higher in the dry season compared to the wet season major ions in groundwater such as cl na so4 and mg2 are used as an indication of saltwater intrusion into freshwater aquifer and are presented in table 2 the concentration of cl ranges from 0 1 to 18 970 mg l with an average value of 218 mg l in wet season samples while those from the dry season range from 0 9 mg l to 19 230 mg l with an average value of 32 mg l chloride concentration shows a slight increase in concentration during the dry season the concentration of na ranges from 0 1 to 8857 mg l and 0 6 to 9420 mg l with an average of 107 and 104 mg l for wet and dry seasons respectively the correlation coefficient between chloride and sodium tables 3 a and 3b in the wet season r 0 01 compared to dry season r 0 98 indicate the diverse source of chloride which could be attributed to anthropogenic contribution possibly effluent from sewage or leachates longe and balogun 2010 e a ayolabi et al 2013 lapworth et al 2017 we cannot discount the impact of precipitation and evaporation which causes mineral precipitation from the seawater and halite which characterised the dry season however the concentrations of sodium and chloride are far below equilibrium halite saturation so4 2 concentration ranges from 0 1 to 2211 mg l with an average of 245 mg l in the wet season and 0 3 576 mg l and the average concentration of 17 6 mg l in groundwater samples collected during the dry season mg2 concentration ranges from 0 04 to 1377 mg l with an average value of 18 4 mg l in the wet season and 0 1 1416 mg l with an average concentration of 18 6 mg l in the dry season high correlation of so4 with cl r 1 0 and conversely low correlation r 0 05 with na and the relatively high correlation between cl and no3 r 0 60 further affirm the anthropogenic influence see tables 3a and 3b most of the increases observed in cl na mg and so4 occurred in locations within the proximity of the sea cl also shows higher correlation with all the major ions except no3 in water samples from dry season this could be attributed to the effect of salinisation resulted from saltwater intrusion and evaporation dissolution with dominant na cl and ca cl water type see tables 4 a and 4b 4 2 groundwater characterisation using hef diagram the hydrochemical facies evolution diagram hfe d developed by giménez forcada et al 2010 was employed in this study the method has been used by several authors namely charette and allen 2006 wu et al 2010 li et al 2015 amiri et al 2016 han et al 2016 and shi et al 2018 and provides a simple way to identify the state of the coastal aquifer with respect to intrusion freshening phases the processes are identified by the distribution of anions and cations percentages in the square diagram fig 5 in the hfe diagram four main facies are recognised which include na cl sea saltwater ca hco3 natural freshwater ca cl salinised water with reverse cation exchange and na hco3 salinised water with direct cation exchange fig 5 the facies explained two almost simultaneous processes which occur during the intrusion stage of saltwater into freshwater the facies types located above and to the left of the conservative mixing line are representative of the freshening phase whereas facies types situated below and to the right of the line characterise the sea saltwater intrusion phase facies types located in the centre of hfe diagram can be considered as a mixing phase for both fresh and saltwater representing the transformation phase for either freshening or intrusion phases in the intrusion and freshening fields various sub steps can be identified following the salinity evolution through the cl percentage the freshening sub steps include f 1 f 2 f 3 f 4 and fw representative of freshwater composition in this diagram the intrusion sub steps related to the sea saltwater intrusion phase are represented as i 1 i 2 i 3 i 4 and sw representative sea saltwater composition during the recharge of the aquifer the groundwater is said to be in the freshening phase with f4 with dominant ca hco3 in the inland towards the northern parts of the basin bounded by the precambrian rock which is unconformably overlain by the oldest abeokuta formation groundwater aquifer this facies is gradually transforming to mixed ca na hco3 rock this begins from an initial state because the aquifer contains kaolinite which releases more na ions into the groundwater to form a mixed water of facies f 3 mixna mixhco3 ca mixhco3 and mix as the water continues to flow within the basin the groundwater gradually transforms to f 2 mixna mixcl probably due to the influence of sea spraying and possible effluents from the industries as the industrial activities increase towards the same trend as groundwater flow down south finally the f 1 facies represents water type which has experienced influence of saltwater intrusion and is mostly close to the coastline see fig 4a b na cl water type dominates the coastal plain sands and alluvium deposits aquifer and some locations along river channels and lagoon especially in the rainy season a summary of water types is shown in tables 4a and 4b while fig 4a and b shows their spatial distribution across edb for both wet and dry season respectively finally the intrusion process salinisation of the aquifer is reduced as the freshening increases northward towards the inland of the basin 4 3 ionic ratio ionic ratios have been used to evaluate seawater intrusion in coastal areas at different locations around the world custodio 2005 khaska et al 2012 li et al 2015 katz et al 2010 aniekan edet 2016 the ionic ratio of water samples for both wet and dry season in the basin are presented in table 5 tables 6 a and 6b contain the correlation between ec saltwater mixing index smi and these ratios these ratios are considered to be a good indicator of seawater intrusion they include na ca2 ca2 cl na ca2 cl hco3 mg cl ca so4 so4 cl and cl br the ratio mg2 cl shows moderate positive correlation r 0 946 with na cl in the wet season and r 0 919 in the dry season this correlation indicates seawater mixed in groundwater for both seasons the cl br in groundwater ranges from 4 46 to 346 wet and 6 45 to 460 dry with an average of 170 and 49 respectively there is a weak correlation between ec and cl br tables 6a and 6b with r 0 192 and 0 297 for the wet and dry seasons respectively higher correlation values between ec and cl br in water samples during the dry season indicates more influence of seawater in the dry as compared to the wet season this is confirmed by ec and smi correlation which is 0 516 in the wet season and 0 931 in the dry season this process suggests chloride in the groundwater in the wet season is more from non seawater sources e g effluent while the groundwater in the dry season has more influence of seawater the ratios of na cl showed significant correlation with ec r 0 73 see tables 6a and 6b in the wet season and very weak r 0 070 in the dry season which also confirmed the earlier statement 4 3 1 revelle coefficient cl co3 hco3 ratio the revelle coefficient cl co3 hco3 ratio has been used as a criterion to evaluate the saltwater intrusion in previous groundwater studies abdalla 2016 edet 2016 kumar et al 2010 chloride is one of the dominant ions in seawater and mostly occurs in small amounts in groundwater hco3 is usually the most abundant negative ion in groundwater while it occurs in low concentration in seawater the ration of these anions is used as a measure of the degree of contamination of freshwater by saltwater the classification is shown in table 7 in this study 55 2 and 45 9 of the sampled groundwater fell into the category of good quality water with respect to cl hco3 ratio for wet and dry seasons respectively while 39 6 and 42 9 of the samples showed slight seawater influence for the respective season seawater influence was observed on 2 25 of the samples from the dry season and 0 from the wet season the highest seawater impact is observed in water samples from wells located around okun ajjah ode mahin and gbetomey these are less than 500 m from the coastline except ode mahin which is within 100 m from the sea lagoon only one sample collected showed extreme influence expected from seawater this result further confirms the applicability of this method in the evaluation of groundwater quality with regard to saltwater intrusion narany et al 2014 comparing the results of the wet season with the dry season there is a slightly higher intrusion in the dry season which could be attributed to over abstraction of groundwater when common rain harvesting stopped while dilution could be responsible for low salinity in the wet season table 7 chloride concentration was classified into fresh fresh brackish brackish brackish salt salt and hyperhaline as shown in table 8 the results revealed 97 92 and 95 5 water fall within the freshwater class for wet and dry seasons respectively this method only shows the slight effect of seasonal variation on saltwater intrusion with 1 0 and 0 7 which represent the only sample collected from the sea as the saltwater among the samples while 2 3 of the dry season groundwater samples indicate brackish salt water compared to 0 of the wet season 4 4 assessment of intrusion using saltwater mixing index smi the seawater mixing index smi which was proposed by par et al 2005 was also employed in this study to further assess the groundwater of the eastern dahomey basin with respect to seawater pollution the results of this method are presented in table 9 the results show that 96 9 and 93 2 per cent of the groundwater samples from both wet and dry seasons fall within a freshwater category with smi values below 1 0 while 1 1 and 2 3 of respective wet and dry season samples areslightly polluted based on smi with values falling between 1 0 and 2 0 2 08 and 3 0 of wet and dry season water samples revealed smi values between 10 0 and 150 0 which indicate dangerously polluted groundwater with saltwater intrusion this represents the groundwater from gbetomey in badagary ogombo okun ajjah and ode mahin in the wet and dry season in addition to those mentioned earlier the isheri and adesanya areas near lekki during the dry season samples also revealed high smi values this is also supported by the moderate to high correlation value between smi ec and cl hco3 with a correlation coefficient of 0 51 and 0 88 table 6a in the wet season while smi ec and na cl revealed correlation values of 0 93 and 0 50 but low correlation value of 0 02 with cl hco3 in the dry season samples table 6b the variation in these correlation could be artributed to effect of sea spraying which salt dissolution in precipitation in the wet season and evaporationconcentration mineral dissolution in the dry season vengosh and rosenthal 1994 abimbola et al 1999 edet 2019 4 5 groundwater quality index in relation to saltwater intrusion the aquifer monitoring and vulnerability maps for saltwater intrusion were prepared based on calculations of gqiswi and hfe diagrams for both wet and dry seasons based on gqiswi method as presented in tables 10 and 11 the spatial distribution maps fig 6 revealed that the study area is dominated by freshwater in both wet mean gqiswi 21 0 and dry seasons mean gqiswi 70 4 however some fingerprint of saltwater intrusion was identified in both seasons in locations along the coastline due to their proximity to the gulf of guinea saline water was identified in some locations far inland into the basin especially along the rivers during the wet season low correlation of na and cl r 0 01 in wet season and a conversely high value r 0 98 implies a different origin of cl in groundwater higher correlation of cl with no3 r 0 60 in the wet season suggests anthropogenic influence which could be attributed to high recharge and soil saturation rate while a relatively low correlation value r 0 25 between cl and no3 suggests geogenic sources of seawater intrusion and evapoconcentration in the dry season a few boreholes within 500 m of the coastline located at the south central to the southwestern part within the coastal plain sand and alluvium deposit show relatively higher salinity this higher salinity is suspected to be an indication of a saltwater intrusion processes such as over abstraction of water from the shallow aquifer flooding triggered by sea level rise due to climate change and effluence from domestic and municipal waste might contribute to future increases in the salinity of groundwater within this basin aladejana et al 2020 total evaporation with precipitation of halite minerals along the riverbed has been reported in a few areas e a e a ayolabi et al 2013 odukoya et al 2013 it is important to note that halite is not considered a major source of salinity as freshwater predominates the areas along the coastline where most of the shallow wells tap the unconfined aquifer that is directly recharged by the precipitation the gqiswi show mixed groundwater types as predominant groundwater across the eastern dahomey basin this predomination of mixed groundwater type based on gqiswi is also supported by the hydrochemical facies evolution diagram hfe d earlier presented in fig 5 the mixing characteristics observed across this basin could be attributed to the nature geology of the basin through rock water interaction and also to topography gravity driven flow generally in a north south direction fig 6 5 conclusion in this study saltwater intrusion into the freshwater aquifer of the eastern dahomey basin southwestern nigeria was monitored using a seasonal hydrochemical quality index and ionic ratios such as hfe d smi and gqiswi and ionic ratio such as cl br cl hco3 that are used to evaluate seawater intrusion pearson correlation analysis physicochemical parameters especially na ca2 mg2 cl hco3 and so4 2 and ec values revealed the influence of seawater intrusion in some of the water samples from wells that are relatively deeper within the proximity of the coastline of seme lekki eleko okun ajjah ode mahin and igbokoda it further revealed the anthropogenic influence of industrial and municipal effluent especially in samples from wells within the alluvium deposit which are generally closer to the river channels flood plain results of hfe d ionic ratios smi and gqiswi revealed that mixed groundwater of na ca hco3 and na cl dominate the area due to gravity driven flow spatial distribution of groundwater revealed freshening which increases inland from the coastline towards the northern part of the basin results of the groundwater quality index confirmed this and identified few locations of saline water around lekki okun ajjah and the ode mahin in both wet and dry seasons most sampled boreholes show freshwater during the wet season above the units

11952,the impacts of recurrent drought events have necessitated the spatiotemporal trends analysis of drought and prioritization of groundwater resource in sokoto rima river basin difference drought index ddi was calculated from downloaded modis satellite images in dry seasons within two decadal windows 2000 2018 the index confirmed the trails of droughts in the basin with sub basins i and iv the worst hit morphometric analysis of the basin revealed sixth order and elongated basin type with all the sub basins flowing in south eastern direction the favorable geomorphic units for groundwater prospecting can be found in dissected hills folded mountain and flood plains structural analysis revealed low lineament density and length in sub basins i and ii and high in sub basins iii and iv respectively sub basins iv and i have been ranked as the groundwater deficit and surplus basins respectively using the results obtained from geomorphic morphometric and structural analyses the results obtained from the spatiotemporal trends and sub basin wise prioritization analyses affirmed that agricultural practices and availability of groundwater resources in sub basin iv will be at great risk conclusively this study accurately identified areas under groundwater scarcity and these techniques can be applied to any hydrological basin the regional hydrogeological mapping of aquifers is recommended for further understanding on their vulnerability and resilience to drought events graphical abstract image 1 keywords drought groundwater sub basins sokoto rima river basin 1 introduction apart from flooding another hydrological extreme that slowly sneaks up and majorly influences many segments of the economy and runs on many time scales is drought chao et al 2016 mustafa et al 2017 the occurrence of drought is natural and complex linked to reduction or absence of rainfall events especially in semi arid to arid areas it is usually marked by temporary absence of water and very difficult to monitor oladipo 1993 van loon et al 2016 the impacts of drought are severe and have been reported in several studies all over the world masih et al 2014 orimoloye et al 2021 the surface water component of water resources is worst hit by drought the impact of drought is noticeable on groundwater resources via reduction of recharge and storage of groundwater in the aquifer this has widening the gap of water supply to the expected water demand for irrigation domestic and industrial consumption monitoring drought events is time consuming and the employment of remote sensing seems to be the ultimate tool for its monitoring on regional or basinal scales gulácsi and kovács 2015 orimoloye et al 2019 2020 adedeji et al 2020 this tool has aided the classification and potentiality of droughts spatially and temporally this intervention has also allowed the demarcation of the most drought prone areas thus providing opportunities for implementation of mitigation and survival measures caloiero 2017 dabanli 2018 difference drought index ddi among many terrain indices tends to be simplest in the classification of drought than other indices gulácsi and kovács 2015 most studies centered solely on the identification and classification of drought with few studies showing adequate consideration for the perspectivity of groundwater resource as an emergency and reliable resource to act as buffer during drought events mussa et al 2014 owolabi et al 2020 emphatically it is of great necessity to examine the behavior of groundwater resources in a terrain faced with recurrent cases of drought events remote sensing as a tool through morphometry hydrogeomorphology and structural analysis continues to serve as a veritable implement for diverse hydrological studies especially valuation of groundwater and surface water prospectivities jasmin and mallikarjuna 2013 suresh et al 2004 accurate location selection of water retention structure and conservation of soils on a basinal scale sreedevi et al 2005 wani and javed 2013 integration of the results from morphometry geomorphic and structural analysis otherwise known as objective wise prioritization has become an essential tactic in the development of groundwater resource in different terrains aher et al 2014 kaliraj et al 2014 balasubramanian et al 2017 aladejana and fagbohun 2018 sahu et al 2018 this has aided the delineation of critical areas such that these critical areas might receive actions on mitigation attention and protection on an urgency basis vittala et al 2008 sokoto rima river basin srrb one of the largest hydrological basins in nigeria had experienced the most severe drought events due to high variability in rainfall omolabi and fagbohun 2018 high population density coupled with their sole dependence on water for numerous purposes have subjected the populace to water shortage from drought scenarios with attendant food scarcity omolabi and fagbohun 2018 plant life and farming system have been reduced and distorted thereby leading to scarcity of agricultural resources the occurrence of drought events is so severe in srrb such that it had affected the growth and reproduction rate of cattle calves donkeys camels and horses and the survival of surface water and subsurface water resources is also at risk in this part of nigeria abaje et al 2013 amidst prevailing drought events what role has the different aquifer systems play in meeting the various water demands are the aquifers also vulnerable or resilience to drought events to what extent in area size has the drought affected sokoto rima river basin how often is the occurrence of drought in the basin taking these questions into account the present situation pushes for the application of geospatial techniques using remote sensing techniques in understanding the trends of drought and occurrence of groundwater in sokoto rima river basin groundwater scarcity and potentiality have been carefully chosen as the simple criterion for ranking due to the dependence of groundwater in a semi arid area like srrb management of its groundwater resource is very crucial to her sustainability especially at basinal level thus this study presents the level and measure of drought harshness and zones of favorable sites for groundwater in the basin using the results from difference drought index within a window of two decades and basin wise prioritization analysis 2 study area 2 1 description of sokoto rima river basin srrb sokoto rima river basin srrb is the third largest river basin with a total area coverage of 126 182 km2 in nigeria and it falls into the niger north hydrological areas offodile 2014 fig 1 this basin experiences temperature ranging from 24 c to 38 c with an average temperature of 16 c this critical temperate zone is located above latitude 10on which forms part of the sahel expanse of africa an area with recurrent cases of droughts the annual average rainfall ranges from 600 mm to 1000 mm across the basin with wet season lasting for five months may to october and protracted dry period lasting for seven months october to april anderson and ogilbee 1973 nigeria population census npc put the country s population at 198 million out of which the basin host approximately 16 million human population as at 2006 npc 2006 moreover this basin is majorly drained by river rima and other minor rivers with associated tributaries omolabi and fagbohun 2018 overland flow type characterizes the style of the stream flow in the basin the perennial nature of river rima hinges partly on the spring water discharging from the perched aquifer of kalamabaina formation the different morphological units such as uplands plains and lowlands are direct products of the geological and geomorphological processes at play in the basin swindell 1986 omolabi and fagbohun 2018 2 2 geology and hydrogeology of sokoto rima river basin srrb is underlain by two contrasting geological settings comprises the sedimentary and crystalline rocks fig 2 the northern and southern parts are underlain by cretaceous and tertiary sediments and basement complex rocks respectively wali et al 2018 the sedimentary rocks include alluvial deposits sandstones of wurno taloka gwandu and gundumi formations and limestone of kalambaina formation the crystalline rocks in the basin are divided into series the older series are represented with granite gneiss biotite granite gneiss granodiorite and quartz diorite the metasediment series consists of phyllite meta siltstone meta conglomerate and ferruginous quartzite lastly the pre cambrian series consists of rocks such as metagabbro hornblende schist pegmatite granite aplite with meta gabbro and hornblende schist offodile 2014 groundwater resources of sokoto basin were first described by dupreez and berber 1965 the past exploratory works for groundwater resources pointed that the geology influenced the aquifer systems in the basin the cretaceous clean sandy and gravely aquifers of wurno taloka gwandu and gundumi formations and fractured limestone aquifer of kalambaina formation belongs to the sedimentary family the weathered and fractured basement aquifers reside in the granitic and gneissic rocks of the basin hamidu et al 2015 2016 2017 the occurrence of these aquifers at different locations of the basin varied as follows unconfined confined perched and artesian aquifer types anderson and ogilbee 1973 qualitatively concentrations of dissolved nitrates and sodium were found to have exceeded maximum permissible limit of who standard in the shallow aquifers in sokoto and maiduguri areas exposing the populace to health related diseases ojo et al 2014 goni et al 2019 the water in some places have led to infiltration problem for the soils thereby posing agricultural problems ojo et al 2014 with respect to water supply yield of 3100 gallons per hour gph has been tapped from boreholes resident in the weathered basement rocks granite and gneisses anderson and ogilbee 1973 comparative studies have revealed that sandy aquifer of the gundumi formation is a more productive aquifer than the weathered fractured basement aquifer due to higher yield specific capacity and transmissivity however exploration for groundwater on a basin scale has not been carried out except for the work of omolabi and fagbohun 2018 who recently employed remote sensing in the mapping of appropriate spots for water shortage construction in the entire basin in spite of several borehole projects and interventions from the government the impact of droughts is so severe on the inhabitants of the basin it is pertinent that a study that will examine the trends of droughts on a spatial and temporal extent with the search for possible groundwater potential zones should be carried out the result is expectedly to provide a blueprint for relevant government agencies in planning for ways to meet up to the recurrent cases of water demand in a drought basin like sokoto rima river basin 3 materials and methods to achieve the set aim of drought change detection and groundwater prospectivity in a drought prone hydrological basin like sokoto rima river basin a multi step methodology was set up using geospatial techniques fig 3 3 1 spatiotemporal trends analysis of drought in srrb difference drought index ddi a simple drought classification index that offers suitable measure of the dryness of a specific area was employed for this study this index pools information from both plant life and water ddi has become an optimal supplement to naturally built indicators or for other indicators generated from remote sensing data such as modis satellite images gu et al 2007 the choice of terra modis satellite imageries for the present study was appropriate due to its capacity to monitor drought on a short period and display spatiotemporal variation of drought intensity at a regional scale the initial plan was to compare the ddi values for two seasons wet season versus dry season but was aborted due to the presence of cloud cover in imageries representing wet season studies have also shown that the peak of drought in the basin is usually felt in december hence modis satellite imageries were downloaded for the month of december for the following years 2000 2005 2010 2015 and 2018 the downloaded modis data were subjected to data processing that will yield good quality data ddi was calculated from the downloaded satellites imageries using equations 1 3 in gis environment the calculation hinges on its inherent visible red shallow and near infrared spectral bands gulácsi and kovács 2015 the involvement of dvi difference vegetation index in equation 3 signifies the strong reliance on chlorophyll and vegetation as appropriate drought indicators despite its limitations difference drought index has been used in drought monitoring in hungary gulácsi and kovács 2015 2018 1 dvi nir 858 nm red 645 nm 2 dwi nir 858 nm swir 2130 nm 3 ddi dvi dwi where swir short wave infrared nir near infrared dvi difference vegetation index dwi difference water index and ddi difference drought index ddi is usually expressed without units precipitation data representing 2000 to 2018 were downloaded from gridded climate hazard infrared with precipitation station data chirps dataset in google earth engine platform the platform is renowned for its powerful visualization of geospatial data this platform also enabled the computation of the daily monthly and yearly precipitation by this the detection of trends and patterns that will reflect the climatic situation was easily recognized 3 2 morphometric analysis of srrb the morphometric analysis was achieved by digitization and extraction of the drainage networks in the entire basin following the approach of strahler 1964 the occurrences patterns and behaviors of these drainages enabled accurate delineation of boundaries peculiar to different sub basins in the basin these boundaries permitted the recognition of four sub basins and thereafter were labelled as sub basins i iv fig 5 approaches based on horton 1945 and strahler 1964 formed the basis of analysis for the different drainage networks and stream orders present in the basin the following linear areal and relief features namely shape factor bs compact coefficient cc and ratios of the following features namely elongation re circulatory rc bifurcation rb overland length rl stream length and lemniscate k stream and mean strength lu and lsm order and number of streams u and nu constant of channel maintenance c infiltration number ln drainage density dd length of overland flow lg relative relief rh basin relief c melton ruggedness number mrn ruggedness number rn and relative relief rh were all calculated through numerous formulae which are presented in table 1 3 3 geomorphology of srrb the acquisition and collection of shaded relief model lithological and topographical maps for the study area guided the accurate recognition of geomorphic features osterkamp 2008 five geomorphic units were identified and mapped with their spatial sizes presented in table 2 and fig 10 3 4 structural analysis of srrb structural analysis of sokoto rima river basin was undertaken through the examination of identified lineaments lineaments were extracted from satellite data following the hill shades mode of recognition of linear features and band 8 of landsat oli due to their strong resolution the mined lineaments were uploaded into arcmap esri 2011 software environment for accurate picturing and removal of other non related lineaments 3 5 groundwater prioritization approach in achieving the prioritization for groundwater accumulation zones in the present study area relevant groundwater indicators were identified and selected from the analysis of geomorphic morphometric and structural features eight groundwater morphometric indicators such as density and texture of drainage system form and shape factors elongation circulatory and bifurcation ratios and ruggedness number were selected all the identified geomorphic units constituted the hydro geomorphological indicators the length and density of lineaments constituted the groundwater structural indicators after the selection process the values obtained for the groundwater indicators dictated the assignment of ranks to the factors for the morphometric derived factors inverse relation to the groundwater accumulation has been the usual practice in several studies patal et al 2012 this inverse relationship influences the assignment of higher rank values to lower values obtained for the shape parameters the ranking continues until the highest values have been reached direct relation of the structural derived and hydro geomorphologic factors to occurrence of groundwater proves to be the accurate relationship olabode 2019 the utmost value of these factors was assigned rank 1 till the lowest value was reached for each sub basin the compound factor was then calculated by adding all the ranks assigned for all the groundwater indicators which were thereafter divided by the total number of indicators under investigation sub basins with lowest compound factor were ranked as highly prioritized and vice versa for sub basins with highest compound factor 4 results and discussion the present investigation centered on the spatio temporal trend analysis of droughts and occurrence of one dimensional linear two dimensional aerial three dimensional relief geomorphic and structural features of a drought prone hydrological basin known as sokoto rima river basin srrb 4 1 spatiotemporal trends of droughts in the basin the values of the difference drought index obtained for two decadal time interval 2000 2005 2010 2015 and 2018 are as follows ddiyear2000 3592 to 2899 ddiyear2005 3185 to 2764 ddiyear2010 3242 to 2792 ddiyear2015 3723 to 2729 and ddiyear2018 3288 to 3035 these values were employed in the generation of five drought categories in arcgis software environment using the reclassify spatial analyst tool the generated drought categories are presented in table 2 on a spatial extent no drought and mild drought categories occupy 22 900 km2 26 146 km2 25 644 km2 and 27 595 km2 in 2000 2005 2010 2015 and 2018 respectively figs 4 6 the result revealed progressive increase in areas that were not affected by droughts from 22 900 km2 to 27 595 km2 this observation was supported as reduction in areas affected by moderate to very serious drought categories drops from 70 585 km2 to 65 852 km2 despite the observed reduction large land mass of 65 852 km representing up to 75 of the study area was affected by drought events the impacts of droughts have been severe and will still be by placing the inhabitants agricultural resources and eventually the economy to water availability crises spatially all the sub basins were affected to an extent by moderate to very strong drought events histogram plots showed that drought events are prevalent in sub basin ii this can be misleading when we put the basin into land mass context sub basin iv occupies the largest landmass the most severely affected by drought are sub basins iii and iv in relation to areas and proportions of drought events fig 5 the plot for the days of all the years shows longer days with low rainfall amount fig 7 the monthly mean rainfall produced in google earth engine for the basin within the period of 2010 2018 shows a tropical climate environment with a shorter wet season and longer dry season the cone shaped plot shows a peak mean rainfall amount of 237 44 mm in august the months of october to may has experienced drought events due to very low rainfall amount fig 8 these trends all point towards very low rainfall amount with the possibility of little or no recharge to the aquifers the fluctuation and variation of the mean rainfall amount for the years fig 9 also align with the result obtained from the modis derived drought maps visual comparison of the drought generated maps with the geological map revealed the resilience and vulnerability of the different lithologies to the drought events larger part of the areas underlain by crystalline rocks fall into no drought category almost all the areas underlain by sedimentary rocks fall into moderate to strong drought categories this comparison supports the possibility of the drying of alluvial and shallow aquifers due to their exposure to surface increasing pumping activities and low recharge rate the resilience of the basement aquifers is attributed to the confined deeper water table and penetrating fractures peculiar to the crystalline terrain despite the resilience from the basement aquifers its reliability depends on the thickness of weathered layer and density of fractures that will influence the development of secondary porosity olabode 2019 oyedele et al 2019 this has been the challenge for aquifers in basement terrain all over the world 4 2 morphometric analysis from the morphometric analysis sokoto rima river basin occupy the total land mass of 103 157 km2 perimeter of 2511 84 km and total basin length of 514 31 km table 3 based on the drainage systems the basin was subdivided into four sub basins i iv with sub basins iv and i occupying the largest and smallest area coverage perimeter and length respectively fig 10 table 3 despite the presence of contrasting geological settings the dendritic drainage pattern dominated the drainage system for the basin this implies that the rocks have undergone intense weathering activities thereby increasing the vulnerability of the basin to erosional activities during rainfall events dendritic drainage pattern of srrb reflect a typical homogenous and unvarying soils and rocks aftermath the processes of weathering 4 3 linear aspects of the sokoto rima river basin srrb the linear aspects include ratios of bifurcation and stream length and the order number length and mean length of all the streams in srrb the values of these aforelisted features are presented in table 4 and discussed below 4 3 1 stream order u stream numbers nu stream length lu mean stream length lsm based on stream order analysis sokoto rima river basin is labelled as a 6th order basin type with four sub basins table 4 and fig 11 this basin holds numerous streams up to 2374 streams with all its order in its geographical range confirming it as a large basin type the smallest sub basins i and ii have up to three stream orders sub basin iii has up to 5 stream orders and the largest sub basin iv has all the stream orders following subramanya 2013 classification for stream orders sub basins i and ii have head waters and average sized streams stream numbers stand as the aggregate amount of stream sections existing in a basin or order sahu et al 2018 this linear aspect comprises of an indirect geometric series with an order number following the horton s law of stream number the stream numbers for four sub basins and the whole srrb range from 58 to 1779 and total of 2374 streams table 3 and fig 8 expectedly the largest sub basin iv hosts the maximum stream numbers while the smallest sub basin i hosts the smallest stream numbers it was however observed that the first order streams have the highest stream numbers of 2021 streams while the sixth order stream has the lowest stream number of 1 table 4 and fig 6 despite its smallest size sub basin i exhibited a developed and mature topography while the largest sub basin iv tends to have undergone progressive erosional activities over time the physiographic and contrasting geological settings proves to be the underlying features influencing the varying stream numbers stream length of srrb is attained by the quantity of water discharged from the river s opening to the quantity of water drainage that split proximately to the river s source sahu et al 2018 habitually the over all length of stream sections is greater in streams of low orders and its length reduces in streams that are of higher orders the first order streams are characterized with the highest number of stream lengths 7 915 km while the sixth order streams accommodated the shortest number of stream lengths 452 km the overall stream length for each order lu was attained by the sum of all the streams in each order meanwhile the overall stream length was found to be 15 447 km with high stream lengths present in sub basins iii and iv table 4 it was also observed that stream length with their numbers decrease from first to sixth order the numerous numbers of smaller length of streams identified in sub basins iii and iv is a direct indicator of the impermeable nature and finer textures of the underlying rocks strahler 1964 pakhmode et al 2003 areas in sub basins iii and iv will enjoy high runoff events flash flood under high rainfall event sub basins i and ii due to their small number of relatively long stream lengths indicate the presence of permeable rocks and flat terrains strahler 1964 there is possibility of high accumulation of groundwater in the aquifers from infiltrating water in these sub basins which will be readily available to be use during drought period mean stream length lsm is another linear aspect that discloses the dimensions of a river basin with its causative basinal surfaces strahler 1964 the result obtained for this feature ranges from 115 29 km to 669 19 km for the four sub basins and total of 1220 23 km for the whole srrb table 4 sub basin iv has the highest mean stream length while sub basin i host lowest stream length a good relationship exists between the streams of the first order and the smallest amount of mean stream length while streams of the sixth order align with the highest quantity of length of stream 4 3 2 bifurcation ratio rb and stream length ratio rl bifurcation ratio is usually regarded as the fraction of the stream numbers belonging to the lowest order in relation to the subsequent increasing order in a river basin schumm 1956 the values obtained for this linear feature for the four sub basins are as follows 7 16 9 9 5 05 and 4 67 with mean value of 15 54 for the entire basin table 4 these values were found to be higher than 5 thus indicating drainage network that is controlled structurally with low permeability and possibility of continuous runoff activities strahler 1957 the stream length ratio amidst different stream orders present in every sub basin differs from 3 52 to 9 81 for the four subbasins and the entire srrb is 27 65 table 3 the third and fourth sub basins were found to have higher stream length ratio and lower stream length ratio in the first sub basin i table 4 this variation arises from the variation in slope topography and erosion stage representing the transitional changes of the basin singh et al 2013 4 4 areal aspects of the basin these aspects deal with the two dimensional morphometric segments of srrb accurate delineation and understanding of the following parameters such as basin s area perimeter length as well as ratios of circularity and elongation factor of form and shape texture and density of drainage stream frequency infiltration number length of overland flow and constant of channel maintenance have led to understanding of hydrological processes at play in the basin these aspects have also been useful in the grouping of drainage basin table 5 local or regional climatic conditions presence and density of geological structures weathering history and lithologies have all constitute the principal controls on the aerial aspects in srrb 4 4 1 form factor rf form factor has undeviating associations with the peak discharge of any river this factor also has strong claim in the forecast of the intensity of river flow on a basinal scale olabode et al 2020 the form of drainage basin is generally classified into two forms with designated form factor values of 0 and 1 for elongated and circular types respectively aladejana and fagbohun 2018 the values obtained for the basin range from 0 26 to 0 41 falling lower than the limit of 0 7854 designated for circular basin type table 5 hence the basin belongs to the elongated basin type with flat shape that will encourage flood flows during the peak of rainfall events kaliraj et al 2014 4 4 2 circularity ratio rc and elongation ratio re circularity ratio is another numerical fraction of a drainage basin s area to circle s area with matching limit to the drainage basin miller 1953 strahler 1964 the computed circularity ratio values for the entire sokoto rima river basin is 0 21 and it differs from 0 20 to 0 33 within the four sub basins table 5 these values are lower than 0 5 denoting an elongated hydrological basin babasubramanian et al 2017 the designated elongated sub basin for will experience low infiltration amount and expectedly high flash flood will flow very rapidly over the basin elongation ratio has been regarded as the proportion of a circle and a drainage basin diameter with equal area to the extreme stretch of the drainage basin schumm 1956 the results obtained for elongation ratios vary from 6 47 to 14 68 for the four sub basins table 5 the high values are direct pointer to the high elevation and abrupt slopes that will influence high runoff over impermeable surface as the flood water move along the stream flow path strahler 1964 kaliraj et al 2014 4 4 3 drainage density dd and drainage texture the density of drainage basin usually provides information on the expression of lithology climate geological structures and landforms about any drainage basin sahu et al 2018 olabode 2019 the drainage density for the whole srrb is 0 15 km km2 table 5 the drainage densities of all the four sub basins i ii iii and iv are 0 15 0 14 0 16 and 0 17 km km2 respectively varying from 0 14 to 0 16 km km2 these values fall below 5 00 km km2 dictating that all the four sub basins were coarse basin type according to strahler 1968 drainage density classification these low drainage densities indicate permeable conditions for groundwater recharge and its coarse texture will support ample time for overland flow of water which can be stored in the underlying aquifers meijerink 2007 drainage texture otherwise known as texture ratio is usually obtained from the quantity of stream segments of all orders existing as perimeter of the area the drainage texture for the subbasin ranges from 1 19 to 5 56 and for the entire basin is 6 15 confirming the signature of contrasting geological settings table 5 sub basins i and ii which were classified as very coarse indicate the massive and resistant nature of underlying rocks the third and fourth subbasins are classified as coarse and medium following kuchaj and bhat 2013 aladejana and fagbohun 2018 classification of drainage texture in a similar terrain 4 4 4 stream frequency fs the entire amount of stream segments making up the entire stream order for each unit area is denoted as stream frequency or channel frequency horton 1932 the sub basins are characterized via their low stream frequencies ranging from 0 017 to 0 026 with an average stream frequency of 0 023 for the entire basin table 5 the low stream frequency of srrb indicates the possibility of structural control from the underlying rocks making it susceptible to recharge of groundwater 4 4 5 constance of channel maintenance and shape factor this is usually an inverse of drainage density of the hydrological basin the values for this morphometric parameter range from 5 95 to 7 25 for the four sub basins while the entire sokoto rima river basin is 6 68 table 5 these high values reveal strong lithologic control the shape factor ranges from 2 41 to 3 90 while the entire basin is 2 56 table 5 the high value of the shape factor indicates low groundwater potential 4 4 6 infiltration number and compactness coefficient cc the multiplication of drainage density and stream frequency usually yields infiltration number it ranges from 0 003 to 0 004 for the four sub basins while the infiltration number for the srrb is 0 003 table 5 this was low thus signifying high infiltration and low runoff potentials and thus provide opportunity for more groundwater replenishment in the basin to be very possible nayar and natarajan 2013 this is attributed to the intense degree of weathering of the underlying rocks the compactness coefficient values of the four sub basins differ from 1 74 to 2 24 with the value for the srrb as 2 21 table 5 the compactness coefficient for srrb indicates further deviation from circular thereby affirming an elongated basin type balasubramanian et al 2017 4 5 relief aspects of the sokoto rima basin generally relief is formed due to the difference in elevation existing between the peak and lowermost point of any terrain features examined are relief ratio ruggedness number relative relief and dissection index 4 5 1 slope a careful study of slope aids broader understanding in the development of several landscapes underlying lithologies occurrence of surface and subsurface geological structures and inference of climatic effects higher sloppy area and low sloppy gentle area have been adjudged to be poor and good excellent groundwater potential zones respectively olabode 2019 the slope for the srrb ranges from 0 to 64 26 fig 12 another terrain classification revealed that whenever degrees of a terrain is lower than 7 a gentle slope predominate 7 15 is classified as moderate 15 20 is classified as strong slope 20 25 is classified as very strong slope 25 30 is classified as steep slope and 30 is classified as very steep slope the terrain is mostly a gentle terrain but with several scattered spots of sloppy supporting hills in srrb fig 9 the crystalline terrain in the southern part are characterized by the spots of the sloppy hills the result indicates the unevenness in its elevation with large spread of flat terrains that have great potential for high accumulation of groundwater 4 5 2 basin relief basin s relief is another indispensable feature employed towards the understanding of denudation features such as the flow of water and infiltration capacity of any hydrological basin asode et al 2016 the calculated value of basin relief for sokoto rima basin is 700 m with wide variations between 150 and 700 m contained in the four sub basins table 6 this result also aligns with the delineated geomorphic units in the basin the highest relief is found in sub basin iv while the lowest relief is domiciled in the first sub basin i 4 5 3 relief ratio this relates to the basin s relief and basin s length in a fraction form aladejana and fagbohun 2018 the relief ratio of the whole sokoto rima basin is 1 36 with variations from 1 47 to 2 31 in the four sub basins table 6 high values of relief ratio are signs of hilly regions that can foster surface runoff and soil erosion low values signal the occurrence of valleys and pediplains that can trigger accumulation of groundwater in the subsurface through recharge 4 5 4 ruggedness number rn this is the result obtained from the multiplication of the values obtained from relief and drainage density of the drainage basin strahler 1958 the high value of 4 92 obtained for this study signals great basinal relief whereas variation of ruggedness number from 2 66 to 4 19 for the four sub basins was also observed table 6 high ruggedness number values are usually a pointer to the occurrence of mountainous areas with possibility of high rainfall amount these high values show presence of hilly terrain of tropical climate and high precipitation with attendant of higher susceptibility to erosion omolabi and fagbohun 2018 avinash et al 2011 hilly terrains do not favor accumulation of groundwater due to the slopes that increase the rate at which water moves 4 6 geomorphic analysis of srrb the strong link of the geomorphological history of a basin to the accumulation of groundwater in a basin has been the major driver for the delineation of geomorphic units for the sokoto rima river basin singh et al 2011 aladejana and fagbohun 2018 in this present study six different geomorphic units were identified within the sokoto rima basin the geomorphic units were folded mountain hills isolated hills dissected hills faulted mountain hills floodplain and pediplains fig 13 their distinctive behaviors and potentials for groundwater exploration were explained in the next sub sections 4 6 1 dissected hills dh and isolated hills ih basically dissected hills are formed from the weathering of the dissected pre existing rocks such as older granites with a resultant onion and tors shape el sayed et al 2013 dissected hills occupy conspicuously in sub basins iii and iv with area coverage of 142 34 km2 and 22 4 km2 and total area landmass of 186 34 km2 table 7 the weathering activities will influence the development of weathered layers that can capture and store groundwater thereby supporting high groundwater yield in the basin most basement aquifers have been found and sited in older granites of nigeria olabode 2019 just as its name implies isolated hills are usually referred to unbroken series of hills shaped by differential attrition and physical disintegration of crystalline rocks anand and de broekert 2005 isolated hills occupy conspicuously the area coverage of 101kn2 and 97 1 km2 in sub basins iii and iv respectively and total coverage area of 595 88 km2 in the entire basin table 7 the delineation of this unit has also been reported in another study by ekpoh and ekpenyoung 2011 this also affirmed the suitability and confirmation of the use of satellite imagery in the recognition of landforms the prospect for groundwater in isolated hills is very poor but more water can be harvested by siting of artificial recharge structures at the valley sides surrounding the hills are expected to capture the runoff waters 4 6 2 pediplains pp and faulted mountains hills fmh generally pediplains are formed when the country rocks crystalline rocks disintegrate and decompose from the influence of tropical and semi arid conditions this geomorphic unit always indicate the last stage of recurring erosional activities tiwari and rai 1996 the pediplain behave as gently undulating landforms and scattered over the place in the form of rock outcrops the occurrence of pediplains span through all the four sub basins with a total coverage of 88 403 27519 km2 and with maximum coverage in sub basin iv table 7 due to the scattered characters of this unit the prospect of groundwater is variable and poor expectation is dry environment like sokoto rima river basin but moderate potential in places near the drainage paths this variability also depends on the thickness of the weathered layer faulted mountains hills are usually weathered and fractured with proof of topographic relief the major rock that make up this geomorphic unit is quartzites and to some extent dissected due to the presence of the lineaments observed quartzite occur largely in kebbi state southern marginal part of the basin sub basin iv with a total coverage area of 1504 96 km2 the structural characters of faulted mountains hills will support the infiltration of water but the prospect of groundwater is not promising 4 6 3 folded mountain fm and floodplains fp folded mountains are formed principally by the impacts of folding in the upper part of earth s crust due to orogenic events the formation of this mountain is generally further in length than breadth their presence is conspicuous in the eastern part of the basin boko area in an elongated outline with area coverage of 595 88 km2 table 7 structures like folded mounts present conditions favorable for the accumulation of fresh groundwater olabode 2019 floodplains are the youngest and second largest geomorphic component in srrb resulting from erosional and depositional processes of fluvial origin and found mostly along major river passages in flatty terrains these units are made up of sub rounded to rounded fragments of sand silt and clay sediments or materials polvi and wohl 2012 inside the srrb floodplains span only in sub basin iv with a total area coverage of 2607 74 km2 table 7 floodplains are mostly targeted as a major source of water supply in relation to its porous and permeable nature 4 7 structural analysis of sokoto rima basin the study area comprises of rocks that have acquired secondary porosity due to their response to deformational activities such deformational activities are attributed to compressional and extensional stresses pressure release fracturing and shrinkage during cooling which usually lead to secondary permeability anderson and bakker 2008 the path to recognize secondary porosity zones is the identification of lineaments which is usually referred to as the secondary structure s indicator lineaments signify weak areas typically cracks joints and possibly weathering odeyemi et al 1985 omolabi and fagbohun 2018 olabode 2019 these structures act as conduit for groundwater flow and accumulation and it also indicates the presence of fractures and weathered zones anderson and bakker 2008 the structural analysis revealed the lineament density of the sokoto rima river basin as 0 03 and it differs from 0 01 to 0 04 for the four sub basins the total length of lineament ranges from 34 58 km to 2572 04 km while the number of lineaments ranges from 15 to 1073 table 8 most of the lineaments are found within the granite gneiss quartzite and quartz schist areas areas underlain by longer lineaments like the granite gneiss should be targeted as good prospective for groundwater accumulation they will support moderate groundwater yield and moreover ameliorate the problem of water scarcity expected in drought events this observation is also in accordance with the works of odeyemi et al 1985 fagbohun 2018 olabode 2019 summary of the structural features is presented in table 8 fig 14 4 8 prioritization of sokoto rima river sub basins the results obtained from all the analyses except drought change detection serve as input in the prioritization of zones for groundwater occurrence the processes involved in the prioritization exercise has been explained in the materials and methods section parameters were selected in relation to the prospect for groundwater resource morphometric linear parameters such as texture and density of drainage bifurcation ratio and stream frequency were ranked accordingly due to their direct relations to groundwater occurrence highest values were assigned to the highest ranks and this order was followed till the lowest values are reached in each sub basin this was not the exact case for parameters such as circulatory elongation and relief ratios length of overland flow compactness coefficient and form factor that have an inverse relation with groundwater prospect aladejana and fagbohun 2018 the highest values from these parameters were assigned the lowest rank numbers and this order was also followed till the lowest values were reached in each sub basin two relevant groundwater indicators from the structural analysis such as length of lineaments and lineaments density also show direct link to the occurrence and accumulation of groundwater in basement and hard sedimentary rock terrains the highest values for the structural parameters were ranked with the highest rank numbers and this order was followed till the lowest numbers were reached for each sub basin all the identified geomorphic units were also ranked according to their occurrence and size in the sub basins their natural features and relationship to groundwater occurrence were found to be direct such that the highest values were assigned with the highest rank numbers the lowest values were ranked with the lowest rank numbers for each sub basin the prioritization exercise was finally computed by calculating the average of all the parameters a term usually referred to as compound parameter the minimum rating was apportioned utmost urgency and the succeeding greater ratings was allotted as low or negligible priority table 9 the highest and lowest prioritized marks for the four sub basins are 8 89 and 4 11 correspondingly lower compound parameter signifies threatening position of water scarcity and it is regarded as extremely prioritized sub basin sub basin iv has the lowermost values of the total compound parameter 4 11 signaling water scarcity situation and immediate need for groundwater recharge is urgently needed this observation also aligned with the findings of otache et al 2020 who reported the presence of hydrological drought in bakolori and goronyo areas they employed field streamflow and meteorological data in the calculation of streamflow drought index for the study the results of otache et al 2020 further buttressed the relevance of satellite data in drought monitoring employed in the present study however the human populace residing in this sub basin will face severe water availability crisis this crisis will also affect agricultural resources as well as threaten food security the dams in this sub basin which is expected to alleviate water scarcity scenarios shall be affected as well due to the absence of water for its operation this will not be the case for sub basins iii ii and i due to their higher total compound value of 5 89 8 85 and 8 89 respectively which symbolizes the sub basins as water surplus higher compound parameter values reflect abundance and surplus of water in the sub basin basins of such do not warrant any urgent intervention in the face of drought events the calculated compound parameters have provided guidance towards prioritization and management of groundwater resources in a climate extreme stressed basin such as sokoto rima river basin despite the low rainfall amount that characterize the study area the erection of artificial groundwater recharge structures may be recommended as the last urgency in sub basin iv fig 15 5 conclusion this study has proved the efficiency of geospatial techniques in spatiotemporal trend analysis of drought in two decadal period and the identification of possible groundwater availability zones in a typical drought prone hydrological basin like sokoto rima river basin the difference drought index ddi values have affirmed the decrease in the drought affected areas in the period under study while there is an increase in areas not affected by drought events the low precipitation amount shows strong possibility of little or no recharge to the aquifers lithologically the impact of drought will be mostly felt in the alluvial and unconfined aquifers in the sedimentary portion despite its high yield its counterpart the basement aquifers offer high resilience during drought events due to deeper water table and penetrating fractures thereby offering hope of meeting water supply the morphometric and geomorphic features revealed the presence of elongated dendritic drainage system with high runoff potentials during rainfall events the geomorphic units signal the traces of weathering activities that led to varied prospects for groundwater development these however point to the signatures of the underlying rocks imprints of deformational activities were conspicuously observed in the two geological settings groundwater exploitation should be mostly targeted in the sub basins iii ii and i while urgent critical artificial groundwater recharge structures are needed in the largest part of the study area sub basin iv these structures when constructed will help in the capturing and storing of water from flash flooding expected during rainfall events the study argues the consequences of the droughts event and its implication on the agricultural and groundwater resources sector and imaginable solutions were recommended as well these discoveries will therefore ameliorate drought impact on the growing human population living in the data scarce semi arid hydrological areas such as the sokoto rima river basin funding this investigation does not receive any funding but rather was borne out

11952,the impacts of recurrent drought events have necessitated the spatiotemporal trends analysis of drought and prioritization of groundwater resource in sokoto rima river basin difference drought index ddi was calculated from downloaded modis satellite images in dry seasons within two decadal windows 2000 2018 the index confirmed the trails of droughts in the basin with sub basins i and iv the worst hit morphometric analysis of the basin revealed sixth order and elongated basin type with all the sub basins flowing in south eastern direction the favorable geomorphic units for groundwater prospecting can be found in dissected hills folded mountain and flood plains structural analysis revealed low lineament density and length in sub basins i and ii and high in sub basins iii and iv respectively sub basins iv and i have been ranked as the groundwater deficit and surplus basins respectively using the results obtained from geomorphic morphometric and structural analyses the results obtained from the spatiotemporal trends and sub basin wise prioritization analyses affirmed that agricultural practices and availability of groundwater resources in sub basin iv will be at great risk conclusively this study accurately identified areas under groundwater scarcity and these techniques can be applied to any hydrological basin the regional hydrogeological mapping of aquifers is recommended for further understanding on their vulnerability and resilience to drought events graphical abstract image 1 keywords drought groundwater sub basins sokoto rima river basin 1 introduction apart from flooding another hydrological extreme that slowly sneaks up and majorly influences many segments of the economy and runs on many time scales is drought chao et al 2016 mustafa et al 2017 the occurrence of drought is natural and complex linked to reduction or absence of rainfall events especially in semi arid to arid areas it is usually marked by temporary absence of water and very difficult to monitor oladipo 1993 van loon et al 2016 the impacts of drought are severe and have been reported in several studies all over the world masih et al 2014 orimoloye et al 2021 the surface water component of water resources is worst hit by drought the impact of drought is noticeable on groundwater resources via reduction of recharge and storage of groundwater in the aquifer this has widening the gap of water supply to the expected water demand for irrigation domestic and industrial consumption monitoring drought events is time consuming and the employment of remote sensing seems to be the ultimate tool for its monitoring on regional or basinal scales gulácsi and kovács 2015 orimoloye et al 2019 2020 adedeji et al 2020 this tool has aided the classification and potentiality of droughts spatially and temporally this intervention has also allowed the demarcation of the most drought prone areas thus providing opportunities for implementation of mitigation and survival measures caloiero 2017 dabanli 2018 difference drought index ddi among many terrain indices tends to be simplest in the classification of drought than other indices gulácsi and kovács 2015 most studies centered solely on the identification and classification of drought with few studies showing adequate consideration for the perspectivity of groundwater resource as an emergency and reliable resource to act as buffer during drought events mussa et al 2014 owolabi et al 2020 emphatically it is of great necessity to examine the behavior of groundwater resources in a terrain faced with recurrent cases of drought events remote sensing as a tool through morphometry hydrogeomorphology and structural analysis continues to serve as a veritable implement for diverse hydrological studies especially valuation of groundwater and surface water prospectivities jasmin and mallikarjuna 2013 suresh et al 2004 accurate location selection of water retention structure and conservation of soils on a basinal scale sreedevi et al 2005 wani and javed 2013 integration of the results from morphometry geomorphic and structural analysis otherwise known as objective wise prioritization has become an essential tactic in the development of groundwater resource in different terrains aher et al 2014 kaliraj et al 2014 balasubramanian et al 2017 aladejana and fagbohun 2018 sahu et al 2018 this has aided the delineation of critical areas such that these critical areas might receive actions on mitigation attention and protection on an urgency basis vittala et al 2008 sokoto rima river basin srrb one of the largest hydrological basins in nigeria had experienced the most severe drought events due to high variability in rainfall omolabi and fagbohun 2018 high population density coupled with their sole dependence on water for numerous purposes have subjected the populace to water shortage from drought scenarios with attendant food scarcity omolabi and fagbohun 2018 plant life and farming system have been reduced and distorted thereby leading to scarcity of agricultural resources the occurrence of drought events is so severe in srrb such that it had affected the growth and reproduction rate of cattle calves donkeys camels and horses and the survival of surface water and subsurface water resources is also at risk in this part of nigeria abaje et al 2013 amidst prevailing drought events what role has the different aquifer systems play in meeting the various water demands are the aquifers also vulnerable or resilience to drought events to what extent in area size has the drought affected sokoto rima river basin how often is the occurrence of drought in the basin taking these questions into account the present situation pushes for the application of geospatial techniques using remote sensing techniques in understanding the trends of drought and occurrence of groundwater in sokoto rima river basin groundwater scarcity and potentiality have been carefully chosen as the simple criterion for ranking due to the dependence of groundwater in a semi arid area like srrb management of its groundwater resource is very crucial to her sustainability especially at basinal level thus this study presents the level and measure of drought harshness and zones of favorable sites for groundwater in the basin using the results from difference drought index within a window of two decades and basin wise prioritization analysis 2 study area 2 1 description of sokoto rima river basin srrb sokoto rima river basin srrb is the third largest river basin with a total area coverage of 126 182 km2 in nigeria and it falls into the niger north hydrological areas offodile 2014 fig 1 this basin experiences temperature ranging from 24 c to 38 c with an average temperature of 16 c this critical temperate zone is located above latitude 10on which forms part of the sahel expanse of africa an area with recurrent cases of droughts the annual average rainfall ranges from 600 mm to 1000 mm across the basin with wet season lasting for five months may to october and protracted dry period lasting for seven months october to april anderson and ogilbee 1973 nigeria population census npc put the country s population at 198 million out of which the basin host approximately 16 million human population as at 2006 npc 2006 moreover this basin is majorly drained by river rima and other minor rivers with associated tributaries omolabi and fagbohun 2018 overland flow type characterizes the style of the stream flow in the basin the perennial nature of river rima hinges partly on the spring water discharging from the perched aquifer of kalamabaina formation the different morphological units such as uplands plains and lowlands are direct products of the geological and geomorphological processes at play in the basin swindell 1986 omolabi and fagbohun 2018 2 2 geology and hydrogeology of sokoto rima river basin srrb is underlain by two contrasting geological settings comprises the sedimentary and crystalline rocks fig 2 the northern and southern parts are underlain by cretaceous and tertiary sediments and basement complex rocks respectively wali et al 2018 the sedimentary rocks include alluvial deposits sandstones of wurno taloka gwandu and gundumi formations and limestone of kalambaina formation the crystalline rocks in the basin are divided into series the older series are represented with granite gneiss biotite granite gneiss granodiorite and quartz diorite the metasediment series consists of phyllite meta siltstone meta conglomerate and ferruginous quartzite lastly the pre cambrian series consists of rocks such as metagabbro hornblende schist pegmatite granite aplite with meta gabbro and hornblende schist offodile 2014 groundwater resources of sokoto basin were first described by dupreez and berber 1965 the past exploratory works for groundwater resources pointed that the geology influenced the aquifer systems in the basin the cretaceous clean sandy and gravely aquifers of wurno taloka gwandu and gundumi formations and fractured limestone aquifer of kalambaina formation belongs to the sedimentary family the weathered and fractured basement aquifers reside in the granitic and gneissic rocks of the basin hamidu et al 2015 2016 2017 the occurrence of these aquifers at different locations of the basin varied as follows unconfined confined perched and artesian aquifer types anderson and ogilbee 1973 qualitatively concentrations of dissolved nitrates and sodium were found to have exceeded maximum permissible limit of who standard in the shallow aquifers in sokoto and maiduguri areas exposing the populace to health related diseases ojo et al 2014 goni et al 2019 the water in some places have led to infiltration problem for the soils thereby posing agricultural problems ojo et al 2014 with respect to water supply yield of 3100 gallons per hour gph has been tapped from boreholes resident in the weathered basement rocks granite and gneisses anderson and ogilbee 1973 comparative studies have revealed that sandy aquifer of the gundumi formation is a more productive aquifer than the weathered fractured basement aquifer due to higher yield specific capacity and transmissivity however exploration for groundwater on a basin scale has not been carried out except for the work of omolabi and fagbohun 2018 who recently employed remote sensing in the mapping of appropriate spots for water shortage construction in the entire basin in spite of several borehole projects and interventions from the government the impact of droughts is so severe on the inhabitants of the basin it is pertinent that a study that will examine the trends of droughts on a spatial and temporal extent with the search for possible groundwater potential zones should be carried out the result is expectedly to provide a blueprint for relevant government agencies in planning for ways to meet up to the recurrent cases of water demand in a drought basin like sokoto rima river basin 3 materials and methods to achieve the set aim of drought change detection and groundwater prospectivity in a drought prone hydrological basin like sokoto rima river basin a multi step methodology was set up using geospatial techniques fig 3 3 1 spatiotemporal trends analysis of drought in srrb difference drought index ddi a simple drought classification index that offers suitable measure of the dryness of a specific area was employed for this study this index pools information from both plant life and water ddi has become an optimal supplement to naturally built indicators or for other indicators generated from remote sensing data such as modis satellite images gu et al 2007 the choice of terra modis satellite imageries for the present study was appropriate due to its capacity to monitor drought on a short period and display spatiotemporal variation of drought intensity at a regional scale the initial plan was to compare the ddi values for two seasons wet season versus dry season but was aborted due to the presence of cloud cover in imageries representing wet season studies have also shown that the peak of drought in the basin is usually felt in december hence modis satellite imageries were downloaded for the month of december for the following years 2000 2005 2010 2015 and 2018 the downloaded modis data were subjected to data processing that will yield good quality data ddi was calculated from the downloaded satellites imageries using equations 1 3 in gis environment the calculation hinges on its inherent visible red shallow and near infrared spectral bands gulácsi and kovács 2015 the involvement of dvi difference vegetation index in equation 3 signifies the strong reliance on chlorophyll and vegetation as appropriate drought indicators despite its limitations difference drought index has been used in drought monitoring in hungary gulácsi and kovács 2015 2018 1 dvi nir 858 nm red 645 nm 2 dwi nir 858 nm swir 2130 nm 3 ddi dvi dwi where swir short wave infrared nir near infrared dvi difference vegetation index dwi difference water index and ddi difference drought index ddi is usually expressed without units precipitation data representing 2000 to 2018 were downloaded from gridded climate hazard infrared with precipitation station data chirps dataset in google earth engine platform the platform is renowned for its powerful visualization of geospatial data this platform also enabled the computation of the daily monthly and yearly precipitation by this the detection of trends and patterns that will reflect the climatic situation was easily recognized 3 2 morphometric analysis of srrb the morphometric analysis was achieved by digitization and extraction of the drainage networks in the entire basin following the approach of strahler 1964 the occurrences patterns and behaviors of these drainages enabled accurate delineation of boundaries peculiar to different sub basins in the basin these boundaries permitted the recognition of four sub basins and thereafter were labelled as sub basins i iv fig 5 approaches based on horton 1945 and strahler 1964 formed the basis of analysis for the different drainage networks and stream orders present in the basin the following linear areal and relief features namely shape factor bs compact coefficient cc and ratios of the following features namely elongation re circulatory rc bifurcation rb overland length rl stream length and lemniscate k stream and mean strength lu and lsm order and number of streams u and nu constant of channel maintenance c infiltration number ln drainage density dd length of overland flow lg relative relief rh basin relief c melton ruggedness number mrn ruggedness number rn and relative relief rh were all calculated through numerous formulae which are presented in table 1 3 3 geomorphology of srrb the acquisition and collection of shaded relief model lithological and topographical maps for the study area guided the accurate recognition of geomorphic features osterkamp 2008 five geomorphic units were identified and mapped with their spatial sizes presented in table 2 and fig 10 3 4 structural analysis of srrb structural analysis of sokoto rima river basin was undertaken through the examination of identified lineaments lineaments were extracted from satellite data following the hill shades mode of recognition of linear features and band 8 of landsat oli due to their strong resolution the mined lineaments were uploaded into arcmap esri 2011 software environment for accurate picturing and removal of other non related lineaments 3 5 groundwater prioritization approach in achieving the prioritization for groundwater accumulation zones in the present study area relevant groundwater indicators were identified and selected from the analysis of geomorphic morphometric and structural features eight groundwater morphometric indicators such as density and texture of drainage system form and shape factors elongation circulatory and bifurcation ratios and ruggedness number were selected all the identified geomorphic units constituted the hydro geomorphological indicators the length and density of lineaments constituted the groundwater structural indicators after the selection process the values obtained for the groundwater indicators dictated the assignment of ranks to the factors for the morphometric derived factors inverse relation to the groundwater accumulation has been the usual practice in several studies patal et al 2012 this inverse relationship influences the assignment of higher rank values to lower values obtained for the shape parameters the ranking continues until the highest values have been reached direct relation of the structural derived and hydro geomorphologic factors to occurrence of groundwater proves to be the accurate relationship olabode 2019 the utmost value of these factors was assigned rank 1 till the lowest value was reached for each sub basin the compound factor was then calculated by adding all the ranks assigned for all the groundwater indicators which were thereafter divided by the total number of indicators under investigation sub basins with lowest compound factor were ranked as highly prioritized and vice versa for sub basins with highest compound factor 4 results and discussion the present investigation centered on the spatio temporal trend analysis of droughts and occurrence of one dimensional linear two dimensional aerial three dimensional relief geomorphic and structural features of a drought prone hydrological basin known as sokoto rima river basin srrb 4 1 spatiotemporal trends of droughts in the basin the values of the difference drought index obtained for two decadal time interval 2000 2005 2010 2015 and 2018 are as follows ddiyear2000 3592 to 2899 ddiyear2005 3185 to 2764 ddiyear2010 3242 to 2792 ddiyear2015 3723 to 2729 and ddiyear2018 3288 to 3035 these values were employed in the generation of five drought categories in arcgis software environment using the reclassify spatial analyst tool the generated drought categories are presented in table 2 on a spatial extent no drought and mild drought categories occupy 22 900 km2 26 146 km2 25 644 km2 and 27 595 km2 in 2000 2005 2010 2015 and 2018 respectively figs 4 6 the result revealed progressive increase in areas that were not affected by droughts from 22 900 km2 to 27 595 km2 this observation was supported as reduction in areas affected by moderate to very serious drought categories drops from 70 585 km2 to 65 852 km2 despite the observed reduction large land mass of 65 852 km representing up to 75 of the study area was affected by drought events the impacts of droughts have been severe and will still be by placing the inhabitants agricultural resources and eventually the economy to water availability crises spatially all the sub basins were affected to an extent by moderate to very strong drought events histogram plots showed that drought events are prevalent in sub basin ii this can be misleading when we put the basin into land mass context sub basin iv occupies the largest landmass the most severely affected by drought are sub basins iii and iv in relation to areas and proportions of drought events fig 5 the plot for the days of all the years shows longer days with low rainfall amount fig 7 the monthly mean rainfall produced in google earth engine for the basin within the period of 2010 2018 shows a tropical climate environment with a shorter wet season and longer dry season the cone shaped plot shows a peak mean rainfall amount of 237 44 mm in august the months of october to may has experienced drought events due to very low rainfall amount fig 8 these trends all point towards very low rainfall amount with the possibility of little or no recharge to the aquifers the fluctuation and variation of the mean rainfall amount for the years fig 9 also align with the result obtained from the modis derived drought maps visual comparison of the drought generated maps with the geological map revealed the resilience and vulnerability of the different lithologies to the drought events larger part of the areas underlain by crystalline rocks fall into no drought category almost all the areas underlain by sedimentary rocks fall into moderate to strong drought categories this comparison supports the possibility of the drying of alluvial and shallow aquifers due to their exposure to surface increasing pumping activities and low recharge rate the resilience of the basement aquifers is attributed to the confined deeper water table and penetrating fractures peculiar to the crystalline terrain despite the resilience from the basement aquifers its reliability depends on the thickness of weathered layer and density of fractures that will influence the development of secondary porosity olabode 2019 oyedele et al 2019 this has been the challenge for aquifers in basement terrain all over the world 4 2 morphometric analysis from the morphometric analysis sokoto rima river basin occupy the total land mass of 103 157 km2 perimeter of 2511 84 km and total basin length of 514 31 km table 3 based on the drainage systems the basin was subdivided into four sub basins i iv with sub basins iv and i occupying the largest and smallest area coverage perimeter and length respectively fig 10 table 3 despite the presence of contrasting geological settings the dendritic drainage pattern dominated the drainage system for the basin this implies that the rocks have undergone intense weathering activities thereby increasing the vulnerability of the basin to erosional activities during rainfall events dendritic drainage pattern of srrb reflect a typical homogenous and unvarying soils and rocks aftermath the processes of weathering 4 3 linear aspects of the sokoto rima river basin srrb the linear aspects include ratios of bifurcation and stream length and the order number length and mean length of all the streams in srrb the values of these aforelisted features are presented in table 4 and discussed below 4 3 1 stream order u stream numbers nu stream length lu mean stream length lsm based on stream order analysis sokoto rima river basin is labelled as a 6th order basin type with four sub basins table 4 and fig 11 this basin holds numerous streams up to 2374 streams with all its order in its geographical range confirming it as a large basin type the smallest sub basins i and ii have up to three stream orders sub basin iii has up to 5 stream orders and the largest sub basin iv has all the stream orders following subramanya 2013 classification for stream orders sub basins i and ii have head waters and average sized streams stream numbers stand as the aggregate amount of stream sections existing in a basin or order sahu et al 2018 this linear aspect comprises of an indirect geometric series with an order number following the horton s law of stream number the stream numbers for four sub basins and the whole srrb range from 58 to 1779 and total of 2374 streams table 3 and fig 8 expectedly the largest sub basin iv hosts the maximum stream numbers while the smallest sub basin i hosts the smallest stream numbers it was however observed that the first order streams have the highest stream numbers of 2021 streams while the sixth order stream has the lowest stream number of 1 table 4 and fig 6 despite its smallest size sub basin i exhibited a developed and mature topography while the largest sub basin iv tends to have undergone progressive erosional activities over time the physiographic and contrasting geological settings proves to be the underlying features influencing the varying stream numbers stream length of srrb is attained by the quantity of water discharged from the river s opening to the quantity of water drainage that split proximately to the river s source sahu et al 2018 habitually the over all length of stream sections is greater in streams of low orders and its length reduces in streams that are of higher orders the first order streams are characterized with the highest number of stream lengths 7 915 km while the sixth order streams accommodated the shortest number of stream lengths 452 km the overall stream length for each order lu was attained by the sum of all the streams in each order meanwhile the overall stream length was found to be 15 447 km with high stream lengths present in sub basins iii and iv table 4 it was also observed that stream length with their numbers decrease from first to sixth order the numerous numbers of smaller length of streams identified in sub basins iii and iv is a direct indicator of the impermeable nature and finer textures of the underlying rocks strahler 1964 pakhmode et al 2003 areas in sub basins iii and iv will enjoy high runoff events flash flood under high rainfall event sub basins i and ii due to their small number of relatively long stream lengths indicate the presence of permeable rocks and flat terrains strahler 1964 there is possibility of high accumulation of groundwater in the aquifers from infiltrating water in these sub basins which will be readily available to be use during drought period mean stream length lsm is another linear aspect that discloses the dimensions of a river basin with its causative basinal surfaces strahler 1964 the result obtained for this feature ranges from 115 29 km to 669 19 km for the four sub basins and total of 1220 23 km for the whole srrb table 4 sub basin iv has the highest mean stream length while sub basin i host lowest stream length a good relationship exists between the streams of the first order and the smallest amount of mean stream length while streams of the sixth order align with the highest quantity of length of stream 4 3 2 bifurcation ratio rb and stream length ratio rl bifurcation ratio is usually regarded as the fraction of the stream numbers belonging to the lowest order in relation to the subsequent increasing order in a river basin schumm 1956 the values obtained for this linear feature for the four sub basins are as follows 7 16 9 9 5 05 and 4 67 with mean value of 15 54 for the entire basin table 4 these values were found to be higher than 5 thus indicating drainage network that is controlled structurally with low permeability and possibility of continuous runoff activities strahler 1957 the stream length ratio amidst different stream orders present in every sub basin differs from 3 52 to 9 81 for the four subbasins and the entire srrb is 27 65 table 3 the third and fourth sub basins were found to have higher stream length ratio and lower stream length ratio in the first sub basin i table 4 this variation arises from the variation in slope topography and erosion stage representing the transitional changes of the basin singh et al 2013 4 4 areal aspects of the basin these aspects deal with the two dimensional morphometric segments of srrb accurate delineation and understanding of the following parameters such as basin s area perimeter length as well as ratios of circularity and elongation factor of form and shape texture and density of drainage stream frequency infiltration number length of overland flow and constant of channel maintenance have led to understanding of hydrological processes at play in the basin these aspects have also been useful in the grouping of drainage basin table 5 local or regional climatic conditions presence and density of geological structures weathering history and lithologies have all constitute the principal controls on the aerial aspects in srrb 4 4 1 form factor rf form factor has undeviating associations with the peak discharge of any river this factor also has strong claim in the forecast of the intensity of river flow on a basinal scale olabode et al 2020 the form of drainage basin is generally classified into two forms with designated form factor values of 0 and 1 for elongated and circular types respectively aladejana and fagbohun 2018 the values obtained for the basin range from 0 26 to 0 41 falling lower than the limit of 0 7854 designated for circular basin type table 5 hence the basin belongs to the elongated basin type with flat shape that will encourage flood flows during the peak of rainfall events kaliraj et al 2014 4 4 2 circularity ratio rc and elongation ratio re circularity ratio is another numerical fraction of a drainage basin s area to circle s area with matching limit to the drainage basin miller 1953 strahler 1964 the computed circularity ratio values for the entire sokoto rima river basin is 0 21 and it differs from 0 20 to 0 33 within the four sub basins table 5 these values are lower than 0 5 denoting an elongated hydrological basin babasubramanian et al 2017 the designated elongated sub basin for will experience low infiltration amount and expectedly high flash flood will flow very rapidly over the basin elongation ratio has been regarded as the proportion of a circle and a drainage basin diameter with equal area to the extreme stretch of the drainage basin schumm 1956 the results obtained for elongation ratios vary from 6 47 to 14 68 for the four sub basins table 5 the high values are direct pointer to the high elevation and abrupt slopes that will influence high runoff over impermeable surface as the flood water move along the stream flow path strahler 1964 kaliraj et al 2014 4 4 3 drainage density dd and drainage texture the density of drainage basin usually provides information on the expression of lithology climate geological structures and landforms about any drainage basin sahu et al 2018 olabode 2019 the drainage density for the whole srrb is 0 15 km km2 table 5 the drainage densities of all the four sub basins i ii iii and iv are 0 15 0 14 0 16 and 0 17 km km2 respectively varying from 0 14 to 0 16 km km2 these values fall below 5 00 km km2 dictating that all the four sub basins were coarse basin type according to strahler 1968 drainage density classification these low drainage densities indicate permeable conditions for groundwater recharge and its coarse texture will support ample time for overland flow of water which can be stored in the underlying aquifers meijerink 2007 drainage texture otherwise known as texture ratio is usually obtained from the quantity of stream segments of all orders existing as perimeter of the area the drainage texture for the subbasin ranges from 1 19 to 5 56 and for the entire basin is 6 15 confirming the signature of contrasting geological settings table 5 sub basins i and ii which were classified as very coarse indicate the massive and resistant nature of underlying rocks the third and fourth subbasins are classified as coarse and medium following kuchaj and bhat 2013 aladejana and fagbohun 2018 classification of drainage texture in a similar terrain 4 4 4 stream frequency fs the entire amount of stream segments making up the entire stream order for each unit area is denoted as stream frequency or channel frequency horton 1932 the sub basins are characterized via their low stream frequencies ranging from 0 017 to 0 026 with an average stream frequency of 0 023 for the entire basin table 5 the low stream frequency of srrb indicates the possibility of structural control from the underlying rocks making it susceptible to recharge of groundwater 4 4 5 constance of channel maintenance and shape factor this is usually an inverse of drainage density of the hydrological basin the values for this morphometric parameter range from 5 95 to 7 25 for the four sub basins while the entire sokoto rima river basin is 6 68 table 5 these high values reveal strong lithologic control the shape factor ranges from 2 41 to 3 90 while the entire basin is 2 56 table 5 the high value of the shape factor indicates low groundwater potential 4 4 6 infiltration number and compactness coefficient cc the multiplication of drainage density and stream frequency usually yields infiltration number it ranges from 0 003 to 0 004 for the four sub basins while the infiltration number for the srrb is 0 003 table 5 this was low thus signifying high infiltration and low runoff potentials and thus provide opportunity for more groundwater replenishment in the basin to be very possible nayar and natarajan 2013 this is attributed to the intense degree of weathering of the underlying rocks the compactness coefficient values of the four sub basins differ from 1 74 to 2 24 with the value for the srrb as 2 21 table 5 the compactness coefficient for srrb indicates further deviation from circular thereby affirming an elongated basin type balasubramanian et al 2017 4 5 relief aspects of the sokoto rima basin generally relief is formed due to the difference in elevation existing between the peak and lowermost point of any terrain features examined are relief ratio ruggedness number relative relief and dissection index 4 5 1 slope a careful study of slope aids broader understanding in the development of several landscapes underlying lithologies occurrence of surface and subsurface geological structures and inference of climatic effects higher sloppy area and low sloppy gentle area have been adjudged to be poor and good excellent groundwater potential zones respectively olabode 2019 the slope for the srrb ranges from 0 to 64 26 fig 12 another terrain classification revealed that whenever degrees of a terrain is lower than 7 a gentle slope predominate 7 15 is classified as moderate 15 20 is classified as strong slope 20 25 is classified as very strong slope 25 30 is classified as steep slope and 30 is classified as very steep slope the terrain is mostly a gentle terrain but with several scattered spots of sloppy supporting hills in srrb fig 9 the crystalline terrain in the southern part are characterized by the spots of the sloppy hills the result indicates the unevenness in its elevation with large spread of flat terrains that have great potential for high accumulation of groundwater 4 5 2 basin relief basin s relief is another indispensable feature employed towards the understanding of denudation features such as the flow of water and infiltration capacity of any hydrological basin asode et al 2016 the calculated value of basin relief for sokoto rima basin is 700 m with wide variations between 150 and 700 m contained in the four sub basins table 6 this result also aligns with the delineated geomorphic units in the basin the highest relief is found in sub basin iv while the lowest relief is domiciled in the first sub basin i 4 5 3 relief ratio this relates to the basin s relief and basin s length in a fraction form aladejana and fagbohun 2018 the relief ratio of the whole sokoto rima basin is 1 36 with variations from 1 47 to 2 31 in the four sub basins table 6 high values of relief ratio are signs of hilly regions that can foster surface runoff and soil erosion low values signal the occurrence of valleys and pediplains that can trigger accumulation of groundwater in the subsurface through recharge 4 5 4 ruggedness number rn this is the result obtained from the multiplication of the values obtained from relief and drainage density of the drainage basin strahler 1958 the high value of 4 92 obtained for this study signals great basinal relief whereas variation of ruggedness number from 2 66 to 4 19 for the four sub basins was also observed table 6 high ruggedness number values are usually a pointer to the occurrence of mountainous areas with possibility of high rainfall amount these high values show presence of hilly terrain of tropical climate and high precipitation with attendant of higher susceptibility to erosion omolabi and fagbohun 2018 avinash et al 2011 hilly terrains do not favor accumulation of groundwater due to the slopes that increase the rate at which water moves 4 6 geomorphic analysis of srrb the strong link of the geomorphological history of a basin to the accumulation of groundwater in a basin has been the major driver for the delineation of geomorphic units for the sokoto rima river basin singh et al 2011 aladejana and fagbohun 2018 in this present study six different geomorphic units were identified within the sokoto rima basin the geomorphic units were folded mountain hills isolated hills dissected hills faulted mountain hills floodplain and pediplains fig 13 their distinctive behaviors and potentials for groundwater exploration were explained in the next sub sections 4 6 1 dissected hills dh and isolated hills ih basically dissected hills are formed from the weathering of the dissected pre existing rocks such as older granites with a resultant onion and tors shape el sayed et al 2013 dissected hills occupy conspicuously in sub basins iii and iv with area coverage of 142 34 km2 and 22 4 km2 and total area landmass of 186 34 km2 table 7 the weathering activities will influence the development of weathered layers that can capture and store groundwater thereby supporting high groundwater yield in the basin most basement aquifers have been found and sited in older granites of nigeria olabode 2019 just as its name implies isolated hills are usually referred to unbroken series of hills shaped by differential attrition and physical disintegration of crystalline rocks anand and de broekert 2005 isolated hills occupy conspicuously the area coverage of 101kn2 and 97 1 km2 in sub basins iii and iv respectively and total coverage area of 595 88 km2 in the entire basin table 7 the delineation of this unit has also been reported in another study by ekpoh and ekpenyoung 2011 this also affirmed the suitability and confirmation of the use of satellite imagery in the recognition of landforms the prospect for groundwater in isolated hills is very poor but more water can be harvested by siting of artificial recharge structures at the valley sides surrounding the hills are expected to capture the runoff waters 4 6 2 pediplains pp and faulted mountains hills fmh generally pediplains are formed when the country rocks crystalline rocks disintegrate and decompose from the influence of tropical and semi arid conditions this geomorphic unit always indicate the last stage of recurring erosional activities tiwari and rai 1996 the pediplain behave as gently undulating landforms and scattered over the place in the form of rock outcrops the occurrence of pediplains span through all the four sub basins with a total coverage of 88 403 27519 km2 and with maximum coverage in sub basin iv table 7 due to the scattered characters of this unit the prospect of groundwater is variable and poor expectation is dry environment like sokoto rima river basin but moderate potential in places near the drainage paths this variability also depends on the thickness of the weathered layer faulted mountains hills are usually weathered and fractured with proof of topographic relief the major rock that make up this geomorphic unit is quartzites and to some extent dissected due to the presence of the lineaments observed quartzite occur largely in kebbi state southern marginal part of the basin sub basin iv with a total coverage area of 1504 96 km2 the structural characters of faulted mountains hills will support the infiltration of water but the prospect of groundwater is not promising 4 6 3 folded mountain fm and floodplains fp folded mountains are formed principally by the impacts of folding in the upper part of earth s crust due to orogenic events the formation of this mountain is generally further in length than breadth their presence is conspicuous in the eastern part of the basin boko area in an elongated outline with area coverage of 595 88 km2 table 7 structures like folded mounts present conditions favorable for the accumulation of fresh groundwater olabode 2019 floodplains are the youngest and second largest geomorphic component in srrb resulting from erosional and depositional processes of fluvial origin and found mostly along major river passages in flatty terrains these units are made up of sub rounded to rounded fragments of sand silt and clay sediments or materials polvi and wohl 2012 inside the srrb floodplains span only in sub basin iv with a total area coverage of 2607 74 km2 table 7 floodplains are mostly targeted as a major source of water supply in relation to its porous and permeable nature 4 7 structural analysis of sokoto rima basin the study area comprises of rocks that have acquired secondary porosity due to their response to deformational activities such deformational activities are attributed to compressional and extensional stresses pressure release fracturing and shrinkage during cooling which usually lead to secondary permeability anderson and bakker 2008 the path to recognize secondary porosity zones is the identification of lineaments which is usually referred to as the secondary structure s indicator lineaments signify weak areas typically cracks joints and possibly weathering odeyemi et al 1985 omolabi and fagbohun 2018 olabode 2019 these structures act as conduit for groundwater flow and accumulation and it also indicates the presence of fractures and weathered zones anderson and bakker 2008 the structural analysis revealed the lineament density of the sokoto rima river basin as 0 03 and it differs from 0 01 to 0 04 for the four sub basins the total length of lineament ranges from 34 58 km to 2572 04 km while the number of lineaments ranges from 15 to 1073 table 8 most of the lineaments are found within the granite gneiss quartzite and quartz schist areas areas underlain by longer lineaments like the granite gneiss should be targeted as good prospective for groundwater accumulation they will support moderate groundwater yield and moreover ameliorate the problem of water scarcity expected in drought events this observation is also in accordance with the works of odeyemi et al 1985 fagbohun 2018 olabode 2019 summary of the structural features is presented in table 8 fig 14 4 8 prioritization of sokoto rima river sub basins the results obtained from all the analyses except drought change detection serve as input in the prioritization of zones for groundwater occurrence the processes involved in the prioritization exercise has been explained in the materials and methods section parameters were selected in relation to the prospect for groundwater resource morphometric linear parameters such as texture and density of drainage bifurcation ratio and stream frequency were ranked accordingly due to their direct relations to groundwater occurrence highest values were assigned to the highest ranks and this order was followed till the lowest values are reached in each sub basin this was not the exact case for parameters such as circulatory elongation and relief ratios length of overland flow compactness coefficient and form factor that have an inverse relation with groundwater prospect aladejana and fagbohun 2018 the highest values from these parameters were assigned the lowest rank numbers and this order was also followed till the lowest values were reached in each sub basin two relevant groundwater indicators from the structural analysis such as length of lineaments and lineaments density also show direct link to the occurrence and accumulation of groundwater in basement and hard sedimentary rock terrains the highest values for the structural parameters were ranked with the highest rank numbers and this order was followed till the lowest numbers were reached for each sub basin all the identified geomorphic units were also ranked according to their occurrence and size in the sub basins their natural features and relationship to groundwater occurrence were found to be direct such that the highest values were assigned with the highest rank numbers the lowest values were ranked with the lowest rank numbers for each sub basin the prioritization exercise was finally computed by calculating the average of all the parameters a term usually referred to as compound parameter the minimum rating was apportioned utmost urgency and the succeeding greater ratings was allotted as low or negligible priority table 9 the highest and lowest prioritized marks for the four sub basins are 8 89 and 4 11 correspondingly lower compound parameter signifies threatening position of water scarcity and it is regarded as extremely prioritized sub basin sub basin iv has the lowermost values of the total compound parameter 4 11 signaling water scarcity situation and immediate need for groundwater recharge is urgently needed this observation also aligned with the findings of otache et al 2020 who reported the presence of hydrological drought in bakolori and goronyo areas they employed field streamflow and meteorological data in the calculation of streamflow drought index for the study the results of otache et al 2020 further buttressed the relevance of satellite data in drought monitoring employed in the present study however the human populace residing in this sub basin will face severe water availability crisis this crisis will also affect agricultural resources as well as threaten food security the dams in this sub basin which is expected to alleviate water scarcity scenarios shall be affected as well due to the absence of water for its operation this will not be the case for sub basins iii ii and i due to their higher total compound value of 5 89 8 85 and 8 89 respectively which symbolizes the sub basins as water surplus higher compound parameter values reflect abundance and surplus of water in the sub basin basins of such do not warrant any urgent intervention in the face of drought events the calculated compound parameters have provided guidance towards prioritization and management of groundwater resources in a climate extreme stressed basin such as sokoto rima river basin despite the low rainfall amount that characterize the study area the erection of artificial groundwater recharge structures may be recommended as the last urgency in sub basin iv fig 15 5 conclusion this study has proved the efficiency of geospatial techniques in spatiotemporal trend analysis of drought in two decadal period and the identification of possible groundwater availability zones in a typical drought prone hydrological basin like sokoto rima river basin the difference drought index ddi values have affirmed the decrease in the drought affected areas in the period under study while there is an increase in areas not affected by drought events the low precipitation amount shows strong possibility of little or no recharge to the aquifers lithologically the impact of drought will be mostly felt in the alluvial and unconfined aquifers in the sedimentary portion despite its high yield its counterpart the basement aquifers offer high resilience during drought events due to deeper water table and penetrating fractures thereby offering hope of meeting water supply the morphometric and geomorphic features revealed the presence of elongated dendritic drainage system with high runoff potentials during rainfall events the geomorphic units signal the traces of weathering activities that led to varied prospects for groundwater development these however point to the signatures of the underlying rocks imprints of deformational activities were conspicuously observed in the two geological settings groundwater exploitation should be mostly targeted in the sub basins iii ii and i while urgent critical artificial groundwater recharge structures are needed in the largest part of the study area sub basin iv these structures when constructed will help in the capturing and storing of water from flash flooding expected during rainfall events the study argues the consequences of the droughts event and its implication on the agricultural and groundwater resources sector and imaginable solutions were recommended as well these discoveries will therefore ameliorate drought impact on the growing human population living in the data scarce semi arid hydrological areas such as the sokoto rima river basin funding this investigation does not receive any funding but rather was borne out

11953,arsenic mobilization and immobilization are primarily controlled via hydrogeological and microbiological activity in an alluvial flood plain in this study two distinctly different high hascr and low lascr arsenic contaminated regions were selected morphological analysis of sediment samples showed the presence of authigenic viz magnetite in hascr whereas detrital minerals viz flaky muscovite morphology observed in the lascr study area indigenous arsenic reducing microbes were isolated from groundwater samples of both study areas the identified microbial species are lysinibacillus sphaericus acinetobacter nosocomialis pseudomonas aeruginosa and bacillus licheniformis showed a significant as tolerance limit and depicted their capability to enhance the dissolved arsenate as v concentration in the study area groundwater aquifers this collective study for sediment color and microbiology analysis of two representative alluvial regions suggested that the redox aquifer condition is favorable for the reductive dissolution mechanism of iron along with arsenate reducing microorganism which found main cause for the heterogeneous distribution of dissolved arsenic this study bridges the knowledge gap between causes for heterogeneous concentration distribution of as in alluvial aquifer and the role of arsenate reducing bacteria in high and low as contaminated groundwater regions graphical abstract image 1 keywords arsenic groundwater sediment minerals arsenic tolerant bacteria brahmaputra flood plain 1 introduction arsenic as contaminated groundwater in

broad consensus on as mobilization in the anoxic groundwater aquifer was identified and reported by researchers owing to the mechanistic reductive dissolution of iron oxy hydroxide minerals in the south east asian countries mahanta et al 2015 mukherjee and fryar 2008 mukherjee et al 2015 zhu et al 2015 despite the occurrence of other as mobilization mechanism viz pyrite oxidation and competitive adsorption of ions das et al 1995 smedley and kinniburgh 2002 gupt et al 2021 kar et al 2010 2011 detection of microbial mediated reduction mechanism of as oxy hydroxides minerals have proven elusive anthropogenically undisturbed in alluvial aquifer and palaeo channels of holocene age regions in the brahmaputra floodplain bfp provides an unique yet complex terrain for studying and unraveling this region which is highly susceptible for high arsenic contaminated groundwater aquifers mahanta et al 2012 2016 das et al 2015 sailo and mahanta 2016 ahuja et al 2019 the measured as concentration in the sedimentary rocks was between 0 6 to 120 mg kg 1 whereas in in clayey soil highest as concentration measured as 490 mg kg 1 maity et al 2012 2017 kar et al 2010 gupta et al 2020 bundschuh et al 2013 2017 gupta et al 2020 the several biotic factors are well known in the involvment of as mobilization into the alluvial groundwater aquifers chang et al 2018 dey et al 2016 lozano

zhang et al 2016 microbes are globally recognized for their redox capabilities in the as contaminated regions arsenite oxidizing and arsenate reducing sathe et al 2018 in groundwater as is mainly supplemented by the dissolution of as bearing viz fe oxy hydroxide sulfur copper etc minerals due to redox aquifer condition prevailing at shallow depth liu et al 2011 2013 many researchers have reported that the high as concentration in shallow depth groundwater aquifer was significantly correlated with the dissolved fe concentration and reducing to near oxic groundwater aquifer condition biswas et al 2014a 2014b hossain et al 2014 moreover the role of microbiological reduction i e dissimilatory and detoxification of as v bearing mineral are well established in parts of the high as contaminated aquifers all over the world sathe et al 2018 the dissimilatory reduction virtue of bacteria further couples the growth with arsenate as a terminal electron acceptor it usually takes place

there are very limited studies that have reported the role of microbiology on as mobilization phenomenon in the brahmaputra flood plain region the studies relevaent to isolation identification and characterization of the as tolarant micro organisms and its role on mobilization into groundwater is still unclear despite the number of studies on as mobilization mechanisms in brahmaputra alluvial flood plain numerous research gap still exists such as understanding of heterogeneous concentration distribution of as and mobility under dynamic groundwater table fluctuating condition studies have reported as contaminated region and role of as hydrogeochemistry in mobilization mechanism but few studies have focused on mineralogical studies cause for heterogeneous distribution and role of bacteria on as mobilization in brahmaputra flood plain therefore this study primary focused on i characterization of different depth sediment from high and low as contaminated groundwater region ii identification of the predominant minerals present and its morphology iii identify isolate and characterize the indigenous as tolerant microbes and understanding the cause for heterogeneous distribution of dissolved as concentration in groundwater 2 materials and methods 2 1 groundwater sampling and analysis based on previous studies conducted by mahanta et al 2015 in bongaigaon and darrang district of assam india groundwater sampling sites were decided and sample were collected from government installed deep and shallow tube wells obligatory data were collected during

and nordborg 2007 mahanta et al 2015 sathe and mahanta 2019 the distinct topographical features such as abandoned ox bow river channels pounds isolated hills and gentle slope are present in both the study areas sathe and mahanta 2019 the flat topography near to the brahmaputra river region makes the tributaries to deposit a large suspended sediment load in rainy season and often change the flowing course stratigraphy of both the study areas formed naturally by weathered sediment load carried from eastern himalaya via tributaries and transboundary rivers viz manas aie champabati bornadi dhansiri nanoi noanadi nanoi and mangaldoi of brahmaputra river shallow aquifers were containing high dissolved as concertation than the deeper aquifer enmark and nordborg 2007 sathe et al 2018 presence of oxidized and reduced sediment aquifers are common in bfp with heterogeneous dissolved as concentration in groundwater due to reductive dissolution mechanism of iron oxy hydroxide minerals sathe and mahanta 2019 2 3 sediment sampling and characterization sediment core samples were collected from a successive depth interval of 1 53 m by using a reverse rotary drilling method biswas et al 2014a biswas et al 2012 fan et al 2008 islam et al 2004 tauhid ur rahman et al 2011 munsell color code chart was used for the classification of sediment into fifteen and thirty two color classes for hascr and lascr samples respectively munsell 2013 this sediment samples color classification decipher the presence of oxidizing and reducing aquifers at both shallow and deeper depth aquifers finally the sediment samples were collected and stored at 4 c until used for further analysis all sediment samples characterization was performed in triplicates solid phase concentration of predominant elements was analyzed using x ray fluorescence xrf panalytical model epsilon 3 worked at 20 kv and current 0 1 ma instrument sathe et al 2018 before analysis each sediment sample was air dried and powdered using pestle and mortar approximately one gram powdered sediment sample was used for the xrf analysis the instrument was calibrated using certified reference material viz jlk 1 and jsd 3 sailo and mahanta 2014 field emission scanning electron microscope fesem coupled with energy dispersive spectroscope eds was used for the morphology and elemental characterization of sediment samples bind et al 2018 goswami et al 2019 total organic carbon toc in selective depth sediment samples was determined by loss on ignition loi technique using following expression 1 dean 1974 2 l o i 550 d w

isolation identification and characterization of arsenic resistant bacteria for isolating as resistant bacteria 50 g of grey sediments of hascr and lascr samples in 1 l milli q water were amended individually with sodium arsenate na3aso4 and were kept in incubation at 30 c for 5 days sathe et al 2018 ten grams of both the sediments triplicates were supplemented with 50 ml of brine solution and kept in orbital shaker for 10 min followed by serially dilution up to 10 7 around 50 μl of this solution was supplemented to the agar plates containing chemically defined medium cdm ph 7 plates

containing naaso2 of 100 mg l 1 concentration and were incubated at 30 2 c for 72 h the isolated bacteria were further analyzed for their capabilities to oxidize as iii naaso2 or to reduce as v na3aso4 by utilizing the qualitative kmno4 screening test with some minor modifications salmassi et al 2002 the growth of each microbe was measured via the optical density o d grown in lb containing naaso2 or na3aso4 of 100 mg l 1 concentration qualitative screening test method was followed in 10 ml glass test tube to identify its characteristic by adding 40 μl of kmno4 0 01 mol l 1 in 2 ml of each culture the distinctive colorimetric test further confirms the whether the isolated bacterium is oxidative or reductive in nature the 16s rdna sequencing of isolated bacterial cultures were performed for isolates bl bs dl and ds sathe et al 2018 2 5 characterization of the bacterial biomass and arsenic tolerance limit 2 5 1 bacterial growth profile bacterial growth profile using luria bertani medium in presence of arsenic for determining the tolerance limit were determined at various initial as concentration 100 to 1750 mg l 1 the growth was examined based on the optical density od profile of the bacteria by using a uv visible spectrophotometer singh et al 2019 goswami et al 2017 2 5 2 fesem fesem edx and ftir analyses for examining the morphology of different isolated bacteria and their elemental analysis fesem and fesem edx was utilized respectively goswami et al 2020 kushwaha et al 2020 for fesem analysis isolated bacteria samples were initially dispersed in acetone and further drop caste onto the stub dried at the ambient temperature for 2 h and gold coated using a sputter coater ems 762 mini sputter coater for chemical composition analysis instrument was calibrated with cobalt standard material which was provided by zeiss gemini model 450 instrument the bacterial samples were analyzed in fesem edx instrument which was operated at 20 kv extra high tension eht rizvi et al 2020 further ftir analysis was performed to determine the functional group present onto the bacterial biomass that were responsible for arsenic sorption borah et al 2019 sample aliquots

kbr was used as a reference material with bacterial samples the instrument was calibrated and spectra was recorded in between 4000 and 400 cm 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydrogeochemistry of hascr and lascr region the hydrogeochemistry results for hascr and lascr study area have shown in table 1 in hascr and lascr groundwater analysis ph was found in the range of 5 5 8 to 7 3 7 mean 6 4 0 6 0 2 in both study area these ph values of groundwater signifies acidic to alkaline conditions of aquifer which was commonly found due to the presence of alkali dolomite birnessite manganite with jarosite and clayey minerals containing groundwater aquifers rhine et al 2008 the orp values were in the range of 169 1007 mv to 143 10 mv mean 85 87 2 69 104 mv reordered in hascr and lascr respectively depicting a strong to moderate reducing aquifer conditions similarly measured groundwater temperature was found almost as uniform in all samples it was ranged from 23 c to 29 8 c mean 24 6 25 2 7 c in hascr and in lascr it was between 22 c and 26 1 c mean 23 2 c 23 c 2 7 0 8 c electrical conductivity ec was found in wide range from 64 30 μs cm 1 to 1060 μs cm 1 953 μs cm 1 mean 461 205 μs cm 1 290 6 108 7 μs cm 1 in hascr and lascr respectively groundwater samples the eh standard hydrogen electrode she scale values were measured in the range of 31 42 7 mv to 343 210 4 mv mean 116 122 5 mv 69 36 4 mv in hascr and lascr respectively heavy metals such as cr was measured in the range of below detection limit bdl to 0 1 mg l 1 mean 0 1 and bdl bdl mg l 1 in hascr and lascr samples respectively whereas cu was measured in the range of bdl to 0 1 and 0 5 mg l 1 mean bdl and 0 2 bdl and 0 2 mg l 1 in hascr and lascr samples respectively the hydro geochemical results of lascr hco3 concentration was found to be in the range of bdl 34 mg l 1 to 580 482 mg l 1 mean 136 143 102 90 mg l 1 in hascr and lascr samples respectively it was found highest among another anion concentration the highest cation concentrations of ca2 was found in the range of bdl 14 2 mg l 1 to 288 398 mg l 1 mean 70 117 45 81 mg l 1 in hascr and lascr samples respectively low fe concentration in hascr groundwater samples can be due to alkali mineral desorption in groundwater aquifers munsell 2013 biswas et al 2012 3 2 major hydro geochemical facies in this study hydro geochemical composition of groundwater was identified using a trilinear diagram also known as a piper diagram piper 1944 winston 2000 fig 2 fig 2 a showed predominant ca2 hco3 and ca2 na hco3 hydro chemical facies are present in hascr study area in fig 2 b lascr groundwater samples ca2 hco3 and ca2 na hco3 facies was found along with additional hco3 so4 2 na facie in few samples the presence of ca2 hco3 facie indicates fresh groundwater present in aquifer whereas ca2 na hco3 facie suggested that groundwater condition is favorable for cation exchange process the identified na hco3 so4 2 facie indicates presence of sulphate reducing bacteria are prevailing and organic matter degradation occurring in the lascr study area the hydro geochemical composition results are well corroborated with the previous studies results performed by mahanta et al 2015 therefore these two water facies support the weathering dissolution mineral precipitation mechanism prevailing in the shallow depth aquifer of hascr and lascr study areas the concentration of these hydrogeochemical facies in groundwater clearly depicts that these aquifers are replenished by the surface water bodies and rain water infiltration into the shallow aquifer 3 3 sediment characterization and analysis 3 3 1 toc and tkn content in the analyzed sediment samples the highest toc content was measured for grey color medium sand sample as 6 for b6 well depth 25 9 m of hascr lowest toc content was measured in light yellow color coarse sand sample as 0 2 for b10 well depth 93m of hascr table 1 in lascr sediment samples 2 4 minimum and 4 8 maximum toc content was measured in the dark grey medium and fine sand samples respectively similarly a high toc content was observed in the grey color fine sand sample compared to yellow brown sand samples moreover as the depth increases toc concentration was measured low in the analyzed well sediment samples table 2 similarly total nitrogen content for hascr at depth of 51 8 m sediment sample as 43 5 mg g 1 high concentration was measured for yellow grey coarse sand with granules in b10 well sample the lowest nitrogen concentration i e below detection limit was observed at 27 4 m of light yellow coarse sand with granule in the same well i e b10 sediment sample table 3 for lascr sediment sample i e deep grey medium sand highest nitrogen concentration i e 19 37 mg g 1 was measured in deeper depth i e 53 3 m in m1 well than shallow depth i e 27 4 m in m3 well sediment samples i e grey coarse sand table 3 3 3 2 xrf and fesem eds analyses xrf method showed substantial concentrations of arsenic avg 16 5 mg kg 1 and 17 6 mg kg 1 fe avg 18 7 and 16 mn avg 1 4 mg kg 1 and 2 1 mg kg 1 and ca avg 3 7 mg kg 1 and 2 7 mg kg 1 in the sandy aquifers of hascr and lascr respectively table 4 the grey color sediment contains higher as concentration as 50 4 mg kg 1 amongst the other samples of hascr but as compared to hascr sediment samples in lascr region we have found higher as concentration as 61 mg kg 1 in grey color sediment sathe and mahanta 2019 the measured average as concentration as 16 5 mg kg 1 in the hascr which is less i e 17 6 mg kg 1 than the lascr regions found by sathe and mahanta 2019 dousova et al 2012 has reported the average arsenic concentration in the sediment was below 1 to 15 mg kg 1 in the dynamic fluvial sediments the crystal structure observed in fig 3 a b and c by fesem analysis have suggested presence of detrital and authigenic minerals in the shallow depth groundwater aquifer sathe and mahanta 2019 in 42 9 feet depth sample of b1 well presence of weathered hexagonal shape hydrated magnetite mineral structure suggest that iron bearing minerals are susceptible to dissolution mechanism and groundwater table fluctuation fig 3a in deeper depth of medium sand aquifer at 32 2 feet showed presence of square shape crystal of clay bearing albite minerals fig 3a the edx analysis showed presence of as in these sediment sample analysis morphological analysis of coarse and fine sand sediment sample of b6 well have revealed the presence of calcite arsenopyrite and chalcopyrite mineral at 19 7 16 2 and 10 feet depth samples respectively fig 3b the sharp edges of hexagonal shape minerals with edx results has supported the findings of adsorption of solid phase as on clay minerals and other elements concentration with xrf analysis results similarly in b8 well sample top clay layer soil showed presence of flaky muscovite mineral at 42 feet depth sample whereas group of triclinic and circular shape crystal structure suggest the presence of arsenopyrite and fly ash minerals in deeper depth sediment sample fig 3c it has expected that few abrasions might have occurred during the handling and drilling process of the sediment sampling elemental analysis by fesem edx validate the mineralogical composition and crystal systems in the selective depth borewell sediment samples mahanta et al 2016 sathe and mahanta 2019 in eds analysis along with as presence oxygen aluminium and silicon elements was also observed in all samples the ratio of oxygen with iron was found in between 0 7 and 12 6 in eds analysis which suggest that dissolved as may adsorb on the surface of oxidized surface of iron oxy hydro oxides minerals matera et al 2003 ratio of oxygen to arsenic elements was found in the range of 9 5 to 56 4 which suggest that most of the arsenic bearing minerals are at oxidizing state whereas fe to as ratio was found in the range of 1 1 to 34 1 suggests dissolved as adsorb on iron oxy hydro oxides minerals in present aquifer condition matera et al 2003 earlier the hydro geochemistry of groundwater samples showed contradictory reverse dissolved arsenic concentration in the post monsoon season the observed hco3 so4 2 na hydro geochemical facies have suggested that oxidation of arsenic and sulfide bearing minerals by sulfur and arsenite oxidizing microbes along with dissolution of alkali minerals causes high as concentration in the region johnson and hallberg 2003 rhine et al 2008 drewniak et al 2010 drewniak et al 2010 2010 sathe et al 2018 the distorted and weathered morphology suggests presence of authigenic minerals observed in fig 3a b 3c it also supports the aquifer condition are highly susceptible for minerals dissolution and cause for elevated dissolved arsenate concentration in hascr 3 4 arsenic tolerant bacteria 3 4 1 qualitative screening test and identification serial dilution and pour plate technique was utilized for the isolation and enumerate as reducing bacterium respectively from bongaigaon i e hascr and darrang i e lascr district shallow depth groundwater samples borah et al 2019 sathe et al 2018 predominately small viz bs and ds and large viz bl and dl size colonies were observed from both the study areas samples on the plates further growth of the microbial culture o d 0 97 was utilized salmassi et al 2002 overall the pinkish color confirms arsenite oxidation and yellow color confirms arsenate reduction fan et al 2008 salmassi et al 2002 screening test for all the isolated bacterial culture showed yellow color formation that further suggested the positive arsenate reduction and bacteria were able to reduce arsenate in both the study area aquifers fig 4 the indigenous arsenic tolerant bacteria were isolated from both hascr and lascr samples and further identified by 16s rdna sequencing technique all the isolated bacterial cultures i e bs bl ds and dl showed similarity with lysinibacillus sphaericus acinetobacter nosocomialis bacillus licheniformis and pseudomonas aeruginosa strains respectively based on the phylogenetic analysis fig 4 rathod et al 2019a b reported that lysinibacillus sp a gram positive spore forming bacteria isolated from a high arsenic containing groundwater bore well chianan plain area south western taiwan demonstrating condition specific redox activities including salient oxidation of arsenite and anoxic reduction of arsenate further investigation inferred that the subsurface biomatrix of the most abundant as mineral arsenopyrite feass and meticulously studied a potential biogenic arsenic mobilization phenomenon via staphylococcus sp rathod et al 2019a b authors suggested that the release of organic acids drives soluble arsenic in the aqueous phase under anoxic conditions through oxidative dissolution mechanism rathod et al 2019a cruz et al 2005 3 4 2 effect of arsenic on microbial growth fig 5 depicts the ability of different isolates to grow and tolerate in the existence of various initial arsenic concentration viz 100 mg l 1 to 1750 mg l 1 the biomass growth profile showed a declination along with a lag phase of 12 to 24 h in all the isolated microbes due to presence of arsenic in the batch flasks 100 mg l 1 to 1750 mg l 1 the bacteria isolated from hascr i e lysinibacillus sphaericus bs and acinetobacter nosocomialis bl showed arsenic tolerance limit of 1000 and 1500 mg l 1 respectively with any further increase in the arsenic concentration resulted in their declined growth or death for both the microbes for the isolates derived from lascr were identified as bacillus licheniformis ds and pseudomonas aeruginosa dl here both the bacterium showed a higher tolerance limit for arsenic in comparison to the hascr isolates depicting 1250 ds and 1500 dl mg l 1 respectively for all the isolates cultures showed insignificant growth in the flask containing 1750 mg l 1 of arsenic concentration it concluded that the microbial arsenic tolerance limit is 1750 mg l 1 further increase in as concetration to 1750 mg l 1 we observed that these isolates were unable to grow and was lethal ghosh and sar 2013 isolated sp acidovorax from northern part of brahmaputra river and reported the strain to be hyper tolerant to as v as well as as iii 3 5 characterization of the bacterial biomasses 3 5 1 morphology of the isolates for determining the morphology and elemental composition of isolated bacteria grown in presence of arsenic fesem and fesem edx analyses were performed sathe et al 2016 fig 6 a and b clearly shows different morphological pattern of the bacterial isolates fig 6 a showed two different morphologies of the bacteria i e rod and round shaped lysinibacillus sphaericus bs bacillus licheniformis ds pseudomonas aeruginosa dl were rod shaped whereas only acinetobacter nosocomialis bl was found to be cocci round shaped in nature fig 6 b displays fesem edx spectra of the arsenic loaded bacterial biomasses which showed the presence of arsenic peak attributable to the biosorption of arsenic on to the microbial surface 3 5 2 ftir analysis bacterial biomass obtained after arsenic tolerance experiments were characterized using ftir to identify the interaction between arsenic and functional group on to microbial surface fig 7 strong peaks at 532 1064 represented the alkyl halide c cl stretch pyridine ii β c h while strong ftir peaks at 1232 1387 ch2 co stretch further the peak at 1442 1982 and 2163 goswami et al 2017 corresponds to c h alkane bend primary amine of proteins amide iii n h stretch respectively ye et al 2013 further the raw biomasses with arsenic loaded biomasses revealed that n h c h bend ch2 co c n stretch c h and o h bending and c cl stretch have played role in arsenic binding with the microbes 3 6 mechanism of arsenic pollution of groundwater via reductive dissolution 3 6 1 mobilization by reductive dissolution arsenic rich groundwater showed affinity with reducing aquifer conditions in the natural groundwater arsenic was typically found in different chemical associations that prevails in probable geological and climatic settings and is related with definite characteristic cause and or mobilization mechanism fig 8 here the reductive dissolution plays an important role due to occurrence of iron oxides on its surface as get adsorbed and breakdown under the influence of decaying degrading organic matter and dissolve thus releasing arsenic into the water stream fig 8 b therefore the groundwater produced via this mechanism is strongly reducing along with high iron and bicarbonate concentration the fe oxides and hydroxides are pervasive known adsorbers for as and when get reduced to ferrous state releases arsenic mobility of as is dependent on the stability of fe oxides and it can adsorb both arsenite and arsenate mahanta et al 2015 brahmaputra alluvial sediments possibly attain most as by adsorbing as v in oxic conditions whereas as iii is unstable the predictable assessment of arsenic mobilized is via the reductive dissolution where fe iii is reduced to release aqueous fe ii and as v into solution microbes viz pseudomonas can enhance the rate of fe iii reduction and thus releases adsorbed as v in groundwater aquifer fig 9 in the present study lysinibacillus sphaericus acinetobacter nosocomialis bacillus licheniformis and pseudomonas aeruginosa microbes were isolated and identified which are recognized for reducing nature of as v naturally tripti 2016 various literature had reported that most of these microbes are facultative anaerobic bacterium that utilizes nitrate as the electron acceptor and are manganese reducing bacteria too gounot 1994 in contrast dissimilatory arsenate reducing bacteria combines their growth with as v as terminal electron acceptor malasarn et al 2004 furthermore the arsenic methylation is induced by the biodegradation of organic matter tripti 2016 hence the study demonstrated that the oxic or anoxic condition was occurring in the shallow and deeper aquifers that increased growth of facultative aerobic arsenate reducing bacteria isolated bacteria ars c are able to biotransformation of inorganic as forms caroline 2017 pepi et al 2007 vicente et al 1990 this study will certainly further assist in the empathetic of as mobilization bio mineralization and precipitation in the holocene age aquifers 3 6 2 role of arsenic reducing bacteria in addition to the abiotic factors various arsenic oxidizing and arsenic reducing bacteria were recognized for regulating as mobilization via dissimilatory reduction or detoxification mechanisms das et al 2015 ohtsuka et al 2013 goswami et al 2018 with the optimal density comparatively low growth rate was observed for lysinibacillus sphaericus i e bs the arsenate reducing bacteria which utilizes only limited carbon sources and tolerate arsenate concentration upto 1250 mg l 1 however acinetobacter nosocomialis i e bl significant growth and tolerance limit suggest that acinetobacter nosocomialis is main cause for high dissolved concentration in hascr groundwater aquifer in lascr region pseudomonas aeruginosa dl was found primary cause for dissolved concentration of as in groundwater aquifer than bacillus licheniformis ds bacteria while some of the prokaryotes are enabled to sustain life by reduction and oxidation of arsenic forms rhine et al 2008 bacteria are eminent for their redox ability for arsenic mobilization sathe et al 2018 goswami et al 2019 the earlier is catalyzed by an arsenic resistant system is then reduced to arsenite by a soluble arsenate reductase arsc and extruded outside the cell by an efflux pump arsb fig 8 c arsenic mobilization and immobilization is primarily controlled by hydrogeological and microbiological activity in an alluvial flood plain prevailing in the region as added via dissolution of as bearing viz fe oxy hydroxide sulfur copper etc minerals into groundwater owing to the redox aquifer condition prevailing at shallow depth liu et al 2011 2013 the high as concentration in the shallow depth groundwater aquifer was considerably in relation with the dissolved fe concentration and reducing to near oxic groundwater aquifer condition biswas et al 2014a b hossain et al 2014 in addition the prime involvement of microbiological reduction i e dissimilatory and detoxification of as v bearing mineral is well recognized in parts of the as contaminated aquifers globally the dissimilatory as reducing bacteria couple its a growth with arsenate that takes place in facultative anaerobic aquifer condition furthermore detoxification reduction by arsc gene reduces as v in the cytoplasm and extrudes out as iii through the cell wall malasarn et al 2004 4 conclusions the present study described a detailed bacteriological characterization study causing a high as concentration into the groundwater of holocene age deposited aquifer sediments in bfp the shallow aquifer groundwater of bfp was found significantly contaminated by dissolved and solid phases of arsenic the morphology of detrital and authigenic minerals deciphered the source of as in holocene age aquifer sediments is primarily of geogenic in nature further little insight is available about the heterogeneous distribution of as concentration and role of microorganism in mediation through minerals into aqueous phase the present study firstly reported the diversified microbial colonies prevailing in two different hydrogeological aquifers influenced by major river floodplains four different isolated microbes from shallow depths i e 70 m groundwater aquifer have showed capacity to prevail in oxidizing environment and have characteristics to convert as 5 into as 3 form moreover these isolated microbes are depending on the geological and mineralogical characteristic of the alluvial aquifer region the sediment characteristics have showed shallow aquifers have ample amount of natural carbon source available for the bacteria to inhabitant in high as concentration regions this study could conclude that the regions near to the tributary s river are comparatively high as contaminated and because deposition of weathered rock fragments on the nearby flood bank than the region near to the main river declaration of competing interest authors declare no conflict interest acknowledgements authors thank sincerely

11953,arsenic mobilization and immobilization are primarily controlled via hydrogeological and microbiological activity in an alluvial flood plain in this study two distinctly different high hascr and low lascr arsenic contaminated regions were selected morphological analysis of sediment samples showed the presence of authigenic viz magnetite in hascr whereas detrital minerals viz flaky muscovite morphology observed in the lascr study area indigenous arsenic reducing microbes were isolated from groundwater samples of both study areas the identified microbial species are lysinibacillus sphaericus acinetobacter nosocomialis pseudomonas aeruginosa and bacillus licheniformis showed a significant as tolerance limit and depicted their capability to enhance the dissolved arsenate as v concentration in the study area groundwater aquifers this collective study for sediment color and microbiology analysis of two representative alluvial regions suggested that the redox aquifer condition is favorable for the reductive dissolution mechanism of iron along with arsenate reducing microorganism which found main cause for the heterogeneous distribution of dissolved arsenic this study bridges the knowledge gap between causes for heterogeneous concentration distribution of as in alluvial aquifer and the role of arsenate reducing bacteria in high and low as contaminated

proven elusive anthropogenically undisturbed in alluvial aquifer and palaeo channels of holocene age regions in the brahmaputra floodplain bfp provides an unique yet complex terrain for studying and unraveling this region which is highly susceptible for high arsenic contaminated groundwater aquifers mahanta et al 2012 2016 das et al 2015 sailo and mahanta 2016 ahuja et al 2019 the measured as

supplemented by the dissolution of as bearing viz fe oxy hydroxide sulfur copper etc minerals due to redox aquifer condition prevailing at shallow depth liu et al 2011 2013 many researchers have reported that the high as concentration in shallow depth groundwater aquifer was significantly correlated with the dissolved fe concentration and reducing to near oxic groundwater aquifer condition biswas et al 2014a 2014b hossain et al 2014 moreover the role of microbiological reduction i e dissimilatory and detoxification of as v bearing mineral are well established in parts of the high as contaminated aquifers all over the world sathe et al 2018 the dissimilatory reduction virtue of bacteria further couples the growth with arsenate as a terminal electron acceptor it usually takes place

there are very limited studies that have reported the role of microbiology on as mobilization phenomenon in the brahmaputra flood plain region the studies relevaent to isolation identification and characterization of the as tolarant micro organisms and its role on mobilization into groundwater is still unclear despite the number of studies on as mobilization mechanisms in brahmaputra alluvial flood plain numerous research gap still exists such as understanding of heterogeneous concentration distribution of as and mobility under dynamic groundwater table fluctuating condition studies have reported as contaminated region and role of as hydrogeochemistry in mobilization mechanism but few studies have focused on mineralogical studies cause for heterogeneous distribution and role of bacteria on as mobilization in brahmaputra flood plain therefore this study primary focused on i characterization of different depth sediment from high and low as contaminated groundwater region ii identification of the predominant minerals present and its morphology iii identify isolate and characterize the indigenous as tolerant microbes and understanding the cause for heterogeneous distribution of dissolved as concentration in groundwater 2 materials and methods 2 1 groundwater sampling and analysis based on previous studies conducted by mahanta et al 2015 in bongaigaon and

isolation identification and characterization of arsenic resistant bacteria for isolating as resistant bacteria 50 g of grey sediments of hascr and lascr samples in 1 l milli q water were amended individually with sodium arsenate na3aso4 and were kept in incubation at 30 c for 5 days sathe et al 2018 ten grams of both the sediments triplicates were supplemented with 50 ml of brine solution and kept in orbital shaker for 10 min followed by serially dilution up to 10 7 around 50 μl of this solution was supplemented to the agar plates containing chemically defined medium cdm ph 7 plates

kbr was used as a reference material with bacterial samples the instrument was calibrated and spectra was recorded in between 4000 and 400 cm 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydrogeochemistry of hascr and lascr region the hydrogeochemistry results for hascr and lascr study area have shown in table 1 in hascr and lascr groundwater analysis ph was found in the range of 5 5 8 to 7 3 7 mean 6 4 0 6 0 2 in both study area these ph values of groundwater signifies acidic to alkaline conditions of aquifer which was commonly found due to the presence of alkali dolomite birnessite manganite with jarosite and clayey minerals containing groundwater aquifers rhine et al 2008 the orp values were in the range of 169 1007 mv to 143 10 mv mean 85 87 2 69 104 mv reordered in hascr and lascr respectively depicting a strong to moderate reducing aquifer conditions similarly measured groundwater temperature was found almost as uniform in all samples it was ranged from 23 c to 29 8 c mean 24 6 25 2 7 c in hascr and in lascr it was between 22 c and 26 1 c mean 23 2 c 23 c 2 7 0 8 c electrical conductivity ec was found in wide range from 64 30 μs cm 1 to 1060 μs cm 1 953 μs cm 1 mean 461 205 μs cm 1 290 6 108 7 μs cm 1 in hascr and lascr respectively groundwater samples the eh standard hydrogen electrode she scale values were measured in the range of 31 42 7 mv to 343 210 4 mv mean 116 122 5 mv 69 36 4 mv in hascr and lascr respectively heavy metals such as cr was measured in the range of below detection limit bdl to 0 1 mg l 1 mean 0 1 and bdl bdl mg l 1 in hascr and lascr samples respectively whereas cu was measured in the range of bdl to 0 1 and 0 5 mg l 1 mean bdl and 0 2 bdl and 0 2 mg l 1 in hascr and lascr samples respectively the hydro geochemical results of lascr hco3 concentration was found to be in the range of bdl 34 mg l 1 to 580 482 mg l 1 mean 136 143 102 90 mg l 1 in hascr and lascr samples respectively it was found highest among another anion concentration the highest cation concentrations of ca2 was found in the range of bdl 14 2 mg l 1 to 288 398 mg l 1 mean 70 117 45 81 mg l 1 in hascr and lascr samples respectively low fe concentration in hascr groundwater samples can be due to alkali mineral desorption in groundwater aquifers munsell 2013 biswas et al 2012 3 2 major hydro geochemical facies in this study hydro geochemical composition of groundwater was identified using a trilinear diagram also known as a piper diagram piper 1944 winston 2000 fig 2 fig 2 a showed predominant ca2 hco3 and ca2 na hco3 hydro chemical facies are present in hascr study area in fig 2 b lascr groundwater samples ca2 hco3 and ca2 na hco3 facies was found along with additional hco3 so4 2 na facie in few samples the presence of ca2 hco3 facie indicates fresh groundwater present in aquifer whereas ca2 na hco3 facie suggested that groundwater condition is favorable for cation exchange process the identified na hco3 so4 2 facie indicates presence of sulphate reducing bacteria are prevailing and organic matter degradation occurring in the lascr study area the hydro geochemical composition results are well corroborated with the previous studies results performed by mahanta et al 2015 therefore these two water facies support the weathering dissolution mineral precipitation mechanism prevailing in the shallow depth aquifer of hascr and lascr study areas the concentration of these hydrogeochemical facies in groundwater clearly depicts that these aquifers are replenished by the surface water bodies and rain water infiltration into the shallow aquifer 3 3 sediment characterization and analysis 3 3 1 toc and tkn content in the analyzed sediment samples the highest toc content was measured for grey color medium sand sample as 6 for b6 well depth 25 9 m of hascr lowest toc content was measured in light yellow color coarse sand sample as 0 2 for b10 well depth 93m of hascr table 1 in lascr sediment samples 2 4 minimum and 4 8 maximum toc content was measured in the dark grey medium and fine sand samples respectively similarly a high toc content was observed in the grey color fine sand sample compared to yellow brown sand samples moreover as the depth increases toc concentration was measured low in the analyzed well sediment samples table 2 similarly total nitrogen content for hascr at depth of 51 8 m sediment sample as 43 5 mg g 1 high concentration was measured for yellow grey coarse sand with granules in b10 well sample the lowest nitrogen concentration i e below detection limit was observed at 27 4 m of light yellow coarse sand with granule in the same well i e b10 sediment sample table 3 for lascr sediment sample i e deep grey medium sand highest nitrogen concentration i e 19 37 mg g 1 was measured in deeper depth i e 53 3 m in m1 well than shallow depth i e 27 4 m in m3 well sediment samples i e grey coarse sand table 3 3 3 2 xrf and fesem eds analyses xrf method showed substantial concentrations of arsenic avg 16 5 mg kg 1 and 17 6 mg kg 1 fe avg 18 7 and 16 mn avg 1 4 mg kg 1 and 2 1 mg kg 1 and ca avg 3 7 mg kg 1 and 2 7 mg kg 1 in the sandy aquifers of hascr and lascr respectively table 4 the grey color sediment contains higher as concentration as 50 4 mg kg 1 amongst the other samples of hascr but as compared to hascr sediment samples in lascr region we have found higher as concentration as 61 mg kg 1 in grey color sediment sathe and mahanta 2019 the measured average as concentration as 16 5 mg kg 1 in the hascr which is less i e 17 6 mg kg 1 than the lascr regions found by sathe and mahanta 2019 dousova et al 2012 has reported the average arsenic concentration in the sediment was below 1 to 15 mg kg 1 in the dynamic fluvial sediments the crystal structure observed in fig 3 a b and c by fesem analysis have suggested presence of detrital and authigenic minerals in the shallow depth groundwater aquifer sathe and mahanta 2019 in 42 9 feet depth sample of b1 well presence of weathered hexagonal shape hydrated magnetite mineral structure suggest that iron bearing minerals are susceptible to dissolution mechanism and groundwater table fluctuation fig 3a in deeper depth of medium sand aquifer at 32 2 feet showed presence of square shape crystal of clay bearing albite minerals fig 3a the edx analysis showed presence of as in these sediment sample analysis morphological analysis of coarse and fine sand sediment sample of b6 well have revealed the presence of calcite arsenopyrite and chalcopyrite mineral at 19 7 16 2 and 10 feet depth samples respectively fig 3b the sharp edges of hexagonal shape minerals with edx results has supported the findings of adsorption of solid phase as on clay minerals and other elements concentration with xrf analysis results similarly in b8 well sample top clay layer soil showed presence of flaky muscovite mineral at 42 feet depth sample whereas group of triclinic and circular shape crystal structure suggest the presence of arsenopyrite and fly ash minerals in deeper depth sediment sample fig 3c it has expected that few abrasions might have occurred during the handling and drilling process of the sediment sampling elemental analysis by fesem edx validate the mineralogical composition and crystal systems in the selective depth borewell sediment samples mahanta et al 2016 sathe and mahanta 2019 in eds analysis along with as presence oxygen aluminium and silicon elements was also observed in all samples the ratio of oxygen with iron was found in between 0 7 and 12 6 in eds analysis which suggest that dissolved as may adsorb on the surface of oxidized surface of iron oxy hydro oxides minerals matera et al 2003 ratio of oxygen to arsenic elements was found in the range of 9 5 to 56 4 which suggest that most of the arsenic bearing minerals are at oxidizing state whereas fe to as ratio was found in the range of 1 1 to 34 1 suggests dissolved as adsorb on iron oxy hydro oxides minerals in present aquifer condition matera et al 2003 earlier the hydro geochemistry of groundwater samples showed contradictory reverse dissolved arsenic concentration in the post monsoon season the observed hco3 so4 2 na hydro geochemical facies have suggested that oxidation of arsenic and sulfide bearing minerals by sulfur and arsenite oxidizing microbes along with dissolution of alkali minerals causes high as concentration in the region johnson and hallberg 2003 rhine et al 2008 drewniak et al 2010 drewniak et al 2010 2010 sathe et al 2018 the distorted and weathered morphology suggests presence of authigenic minerals observed in fig 3a b 3c it also supports the aquifer condition are highly susceptible for minerals dissolution and cause for elevated dissolved arsenate concentration in hascr 3 4 arsenic tolerant bacteria 3 4 1 qualitative screening test and identification serial dilution and pour plate technique was utilized for the isolation and enumerate as reducing bacterium respectively from bongaigaon i e hascr and darrang i e lascr district shallow depth groundwater samples borah et al 2019 sathe et al 2018 predominately small viz bs and ds and large viz bl and dl size colonies were observed from both the study areas samples on the plates further growth of the microbial culture o d 0 97 was utilized salmassi et al 2002 overall the pinkish color confirms arsenite oxidation and yellow color confirms arsenate reduction fan et al 2008 salmassi et al 2002 screening test for all the isolated bacterial culture showed yellow color formation that further suggested the positive arsenate reduction and bacteria were able to reduce arsenate in both the study area aquifers fig 4 the indigenous arsenic tolerant bacteria were isolated from both hascr and lascr samples and further identified by 16s rdna sequencing technique all the isolated bacterial cultures i e bs bl ds and dl showed similarity with lysinibacillus sphaericus acinetobacter nosocomialis bacillus licheniformis and pseudomonas aeruginosa strains respectively based on the phylogenetic analysis fig 4 rathod et al 2019a b reported that lysinibacillus sp a gram positive spore forming bacteria isolated from a high arsenic containing groundwater bore well chianan plain area south western taiwan demonstrating condition specific redox activities including salient oxidation of arsenite and anoxic reduction of arsenate further investigation inferred that the subsurface biomatrix of the most abundant as mineral arsenopyrite feass and meticulously studied a potential biogenic arsenic mobilization phenomenon via staphylococcus sp rathod et al 2019a b authors suggested that the release of organic acids drives soluble arsenic in the aqueous phase under anoxic conditions through oxidative dissolution mechanism rathod et al 2019a cruz et al 2005 3 4 2 effect of arsenic on microbial growth fig 5 depicts the ability of different isolates to grow and tolerate in the existence of various initial arsenic concentration viz 100 mg l 1 to 1750 mg l 1 the biomass growth profile showed a declination along with a lag phase of 12 to 24 h in all the isolated microbes due to presence of arsenic in the batch flasks 100 mg l 1 to 1750 mg l 1 the bacteria isolated from hascr i e lysinibacillus sphaericus bs and acinetobacter nosocomialis bl showed arsenic tolerance limit of 1000 and 1500 mg l 1 respectively with any further increase in the arsenic concentration resulted in their declined growth or death for both the microbes for the isolates derived from lascr were identified as bacillus licheniformis ds and pseudomonas aeruginosa dl here both the bacterium showed a higher tolerance limit for arsenic in comparison to the hascr isolates depicting 1250 ds and 1500 dl mg l 1 respectively for all the isolates cultures showed insignificant growth in the flask containing 1750 mg l 1 of arsenic concentration it concluded that the microbial arsenic tolerance limit is 1750 mg l 1 further increase in as concetration to 1750 mg l 1 we observed that these isolates were unable to grow and was lethal ghosh and sar 2013 isolated sp acidovorax from northern part of brahmaputra river and reported the strain to be hyper tolerant to as v as well as as iii 3 5 characterization of the bacterial biomasses 3 5 1 morphology of the isolates for determining the morphology and elemental composition of isolated bacteria grown in presence of arsenic fesem and fesem edx analyses were performed sathe et al 2016 fig 6 a and b clearly shows different morphological pattern of the bacterial isolates fig 6 a showed two different morphologies of the bacteria i e rod and round shaped lysinibacillus sphaericus bs bacillus licheniformis ds pseudomonas aeruginosa dl were rod shaped whereas only acinetobacter nosocomialis bl was found to be cocci round shaped in nature fig 6 b displays fesem edx spectra of the arsenic loaded bacterial biomasses which showed the presence of arsenic peak attributable to the biosorption of arsenic on to the microbial surface 3 5 2 ftir analysis bacterial biomass obtained after arsenic tolerance experiments were characterized using ftir to identify the interaction between arsenic and functional group on to microbial surface fig 7 strong peaks at 532 1064 represented the alkyl halide c cl stretch pyridine ii β c h while strong ftir peaks at 1232 1387 ch2 co stretch further the peak at 1442 1982 and 2163 goswami et al 2017 corresponds to c h alkane bend primary amine of proteins amide iii n h stretch respectively ye et al 2013 further the raw biomasses with arsenic loaded biomasses revealed that n h c h bend ch2 co c n stretch c h and o h bending and c cl stretch have played role in arsenic binding with the microbes 3 6 mechanism of arsenic pollution of groundwater via reductive dissolution 3 6 1 mobilization by reductive dissolution arsenic rich groundwater showed affinity with reducing aquifer conditions in the natural groundwater arsenic was typically found in different chemical associations that prevails in probable geological and climatic settings and is related with definite characteristic cause and or mobilization mechanism fig 8 here the reductive dissolution plays an important role due to occurrence of iron oxides on its surface as get adsorbed and breakdown under the influence of decaying degrading organic matter and dissolve thus releasing arsenic into the water stream fig 8 b therefore the groundwater produced via this mechanism is strongly reducing along with high iron and bicarbonate concentration the fe oxides and hydroxides are pervasive known adsorbers for as and when get reduced to ferrous state releases arsenic mobility of as is dependent on the stability of fe oxides and it can adsorb both arsenite and arsenate mahanta et al 2015 brahmaputra alluvial sediments possibly attain most as by adsorbing as v in oxic conditions whereas as iii is unstable the predictable assessment of arsenic mobilized is via the reductive dissolution where fe iii is reduced to release aqueous fe ii and as v into solution microbes viz pseudomonas can enhance the rate of fe iii reduction and thus releases adsorbed as v in groundwater aquifer fig 9 in the present study lysinibacillus sphaericus acinetobacter nosocomialis bacillus licheniformis and pseudomonas aeruginosa microbes were isolated and identified which are recognized for reducing nature of as v naturally tripti 2016 various literature had reported that most of these microbes are facultative anaerobic bacterium that utilizes nitrate as the electron acceptor and are manganese reducing bacteria too gounot 1994 in contrast dissimilatory arsenate reducing bacteria combines their growth with as v as terminal electron acceptor malasarn et al 2004 furthermore the arsenic methylation is induced by the biodegradation of organic matter tripti 2016 hence the study demonstrated that the oxic or anoxic condition was occurring in the shallow and deeper aquifers that increased growth of facultative aerobic arsenate reducing bacteria isolated bacteria ars c are able to biotransformation of inorganic as forms caroline 2017 pepi et al 2007 vicente et al 1990 this study will certainly further assist in the empathetic of as mobilization bio mineralization and precipitation in the holocene age aquifers 3 6 2 role of arsenic reducing bacteria in addition to the abiotic factors various arsenic oxidizing and arsenic reducing bacteria were recognized for regulating as mobilization via dissimilatory reduction or detoxification mechanisms das et al 2015 ohtsuka et al 2013 goswami et al 2018 with the optimal density comparatively low growth rate was observed for lysinibacillus sphaericus i e bs the arsenate reducing bacteria which utilizes only limited carbon sources and tolerate arsenate concentration upto 1250 mg l 1 however acinetobacter nosocomialis i e bl significant growth and tolerance limit suggest that acinetobacter nosocomialis is main cause for high dissolved concentration in hascr groundwater aquifer in lascr region pseudomonas aeruginosa dl was found primary cause for dissolved concentration of as in groundwater aquifer than bacillus licheniformis ds bacteria while some of the prokaryotes are enabled to sustain life by reduction and oxidation of arsenic forms rhine et al 2008 bacteria are eminent for their redox ability for arsenic mobilization sathe et al 2018 goswami et al 2019 the earlier is catalyzed by an arsenic resistant system is then reduced to arsenite by a soluble arsenate reductase arsc and extruded outside the cell by an efflux pump arsb fig 8 c arsenic mobilization and immobilization is primarily controlled by hydrogeological and microbiological activity in an alluvial flood plain prevailing in the region as added via dissolution of as bearing viz fe oxy hydroxide sulfur copper etc minerals into groundwater owing to the redox aquifer condition prevailing at shallow depth liu et al 2011 2013 the high as concentration in the shallow depth groundwater aquifer was considerably in relation with the dissolved fe concentration and reducing to near oxic groundwater aquifer condition biswas et al 2014a b hossain et al 2014 in addition the prime involvement of microbiological reduction i e dissimilatory and detoxification of as v bearing mineral is well recognized in parts of the as contaminated aquifers globally the dissimilatory as reducing bacteria couple its a growth with arsenate that takes place in facultative anaerobic aquifer condition furthermore detoxification reduction by arsc gene reduces as v in the cytoplasm and extrudes out as iii through the cell wall malasarn et al 2004 4 conclusions the present study described a detailed bacteriological characterization study causing a high as concentration into the groundwater of holocene age deposited aquifer sediments in bfp the shallow aquifer groundwater of bfp was found significantly contaminated by dissolved and solid phases of arsenic the morphology of detrital and authigenic minerals deciphered the source of as in holocene age aquifer sediments is primarily of geogenic in nature further little insight is available about the heterogeneous distribution of as concentration and role of microorganism in mediation through minerals into aqueous phase the present study firstly reported the diversified microbial colonies prevailing in two different hydrogeological aquifers influenced by major river floodplains four different isolated microbes from shallow depths i e 70 m groundwater aquifer have showed capacity to prevail in oxidizing environment and have characteristics to convert as 5 into as 3 form moreover these isolated microbes are depending on the geological and mineralogical characteristic of the alluvial aquifer region the sediment characteristics have showed shallow aquifers have ample amount of natural carbon source available for the bacteria to inhabitant in high as concentration regions this study could conclude that the regions near to the tributary s river are comparatively high as contaminated and because deposition of weathered rock fragments on the nearby flood bank than the region near to the main river declaration of competing interest authors declare no conflict interest acknowledgements authors thank sincerely

11954,groundwater is a long term reservoir of the natural water cycle india is the largest user of groundwater in the world there are many areas in the country facing scarcity of water primarily due to unplanned groundwater development resulting in fall of water levels if measures to ensure sustainable groundwater usage are not taken consequences may include a collapse of shortages of potable water conflict and suffering therefore it is necessary to identify the groundwater resources and predict the groundwater flows at different locations in the aquifers numerical methods can simulate the groundwater flows for the delineated aquifers in this study the simulation of groundwater flow is carried out using meshfree collocation method cm with cubic spline cs function and moving support domains the results are compared with the analytical solution and found satisfactory the sensitivity analysis is carried out for courant number simulation scheme spatial and temporal variation graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater flow numerical modelling meshfree methods cubic spline function 1 introduction over the past few decades groundwater extraction has grown dramatically according to the fourth united nations world water report 2012 the global groundwater abstraction rate at least tripled over the past 50 years and continues to increase at an annual rate of one and two percent india is among top 10 groundwater abstracting countries one of the primary reasons for the fast depletion of groundwater resources is the relative ease and convenience of its decentralised access for drinking water irrigation industrial and other purposes groundwater is a dynamic system it is defined as water that is found beneath the surface of the earth in conditions of hundred percent saturation in some areas the bedrock has low permeability and porosity levels yet groundwater can still travel in the aquifers measurement of flows in the groundwater is difficult as compared to the surface water therefore predicting the groundwater flows for satisfying future demand is also challenging there are some parameters like porosity permeability and storativity related to fluid properties and porous media properties that govern the groundwater flow in the aquifer considering these properties and variation of groundwater in space and time some governing equations are developed in literature these equations are complex partial differential equations these equations developed by bear 1979 in 1d and 2d domains are difficult to solve analytically some solutions are available in literature but mostly numerical methods with some approximations can be used to solve these equations numerical modelling of groundwater flow started in the middle of 1960 s and is now widely recognized as practical tool for evaluating the flow regime a large number of numerical models are used to simulate the groundwater flow pollution and management of groundwater basins earlier numerical solutions used fdm having rectangular grids for the flow and transport equations fdm based methods suffer serious problems of numerical dispersion and overshooting undershooting and are also inconvenient for irregular boundaries later efforts were made to approximate the flow and transport equations by using galerkin s fem using fem irregular domain could be dealt easily however pre processing such as mesh generation and nodal connectivity is a cumbersome process xin and singh 1995 researchers have used fdm fem and boundary element method bem for 1d and 2d groundwater flow and transport to solve the equations that govern groundwater flow to obtain flow rates flow direction and hydraulic heads and contaminant transport through an aquifer franke and schebak 1997 eldho 1995 akram and david 1998 javadi and najjar 2007 huang et al 2008 magnus igboekwe and n j achi 2011 the most popular modflow based fdm algorithm has been tested in thousands of cases and is now the standard in groundwater flow modelling recently meshfree mfree methods are taking over fem due to its simplicity since last decade mfree methods have gained popularity in many engineering applications due to their mesh free character and easy extension to higher dimensions liu 2003 mfree method uses a set of nodes scattered within the problem domain and on the boundaries of the domain regardless of the connectivity information between them since there is no grid the time one would spend on meshing and remeshing pre processing can be saved this can lead to substantial cost and time savings while solving large scale problems distances are easily computed in any number of spatial dimensions thus working in higher dimensions does not increase the complexity of the method gu and liu 2006 and therefore the computational cost of the mfree methods is independent of the problem dimension mfree methods like meshless petrov galerkin mlpg collocation method radial point collocation method rpcm element free galerkin method efgm point collocation method pcm are used for solving the groundwater flow and transport problems by many researchers lin and atluri 2000 li et al 2003 liu 2006 dehgan and shokri 2007 praveenkumar and dodagoudar 2008 praveenkumar and dodagoudar 2010 mategaonkar and eldho 2011 they have found that mfree methods are less expensive both in computational costs as well as definitely in human labour costs than the fem or bem mfree methods can be used with various interpolation functions like radial basis function rbf logarithmic function thin spline function tps or gaussian function each function has its own merits and demerits kansa 1990 used multi quadrics radial basis function mq rbf as the spatial approximation scheme for parabolic hyperbolic and the elliptic poisson s equation and showed that mq is an extremely accurate approximation scheme for interpolation and partial derivative estimates for a variety of two dimensional functions over both gridded and scattered data later on this idea was extended to various types of problems by franke and schebak 1997 hon and mao 1998 hon et al 1999 hon and schaback 2001 lorentz et al 2003 wu and hon 2003 and khattak and siraj 2008 mehdi and ali 2007 mategaonkar and eldho 2012 they have found that the choice of radial basis functions is a flexible feature of meshless methods mategaonkar and eldho 2011 2012 developed a mfree pcm model with mq rbf interpolation function for groundwater flow and transport the model was working well for uniform size of the support domain and with the fully implicit scheme however there was a limitation to the model with the field nodes at the end where the uniform size of support domain could not be maintained the gaussian distribution is a continuous function which approximates the exact binomial distribution of events the graph of a gaussian is a characteristic symmetric bell curve shape the inverse of an exponential function is a logarithmic function the logarithmic function has many real life applications in acoustics electronics earthquake analysis and population prediction tps are a method for multidimensional interpolation this interpolation corresponds to an n dimensional interpolation techniques from scattered data it provides a superior approximation of the behaviour of functions that have local abrupt changes the concept of spline is using a thin flexible strip to draw a smooth curve in groundwater flows it is difficult to get the exact data because groundwater travels through fractures in the rock or through areas that are weathered therefore in this study cubic spline function is used as an interpolation function for the simulation of groundwater flow the numerical solution using mfree cmcs compared with the available analytical solution comparison of the results has shown that the model is capable of predicting the groundwater heads high accuracy a case study for 1d groundwater flow is discussed also to make the numerical solution stable and convergent the sensitivity analysis is carried out for courant number inter nodal distance and time steps 2 theoretical development transient groundwater flow in homogeneous confined isotropic media in 1d can be written as bear 1979 1 2 h x 2 s t h t following initial conditions are used for the transient conditions 2 h x o h o x x ω generally the boundary conditions are of three types the prescribed heads flux or both it can be written as 3 h x t h 1 x t x ω 1 4 t h n q x t x ω 2 where h x t is the piezometric head l t is the transmissibility l2t 1 s is the storage coefficient x is the horizontal space variable l q x t is the known inflow rate lt 1 t is the time t ω is the flow region ω is the boundary region ω 1 ω 2 ω h o x is the initial head l h 1 x t is the known head value of the boundary head l 2 1 velocity computation from flow equation according to darcy s law bear 1979 5 v k h x where v is the velocity lt 1 and k is hydraulic conductivity lt 1 the actual velocity is obtained by v v n where n is the is the porosity 3 model and development transient groundwater flow in homogeneous confined isotropic media in 1d is given by eq 1 first step is to fin h i t d the approximation solution h x t i 1 n h i t p i x as liu and gu 2005 where h i is the unknown head and p i is the shape function at node i and n is the total number of nodes in the support domain the value of thin plate spline is given as 6 p i p i n therefore 7 p i x n p i n 1 a n d 2 p i x 2 n n 1 p i n 2 where p i x x i and for cs n 3 3 1 time domain discretization based upon the numerical experiments conducted many researchers it is concluded that the finite difference scheme in time is the best overall choice in the majority of transient analysis ence to account for the time derivative following forward finite difference approximation is used in this study pinder and gray 1977 and wang and anderson 1982 i e 8 h t h i t δ t h i t δ t therefore eq 1 becomes 9 t δ t s 2 h i x 2 t δ t h i t δ t h t from eqs 1 7 and 8 eq 9 can be written as 10 t δ t s 2 p i x x 2 h i t δ t p i x h t δ t p i x h t or 11 p i x t δ t s 2 p i x x 2 h i t δ t p i x h t p i x and 2 p i x x 2 values are calculated for all the support domains shape function have kroneccker delta property liu and gu 2005 i e the value of shape function outside the support domain is zero all these values of shape functions and their derivatives are then incorporated in the global matrix for the whole problem domain therefore the general system of eq 11 can be written as istok 1989 12 k 1 ϖ t δ t s k 2 h i t δ t k 1 1 ϖ t δ t s k 2 h i t where k 1 global matrix for shape function k 2 global matrix for second derivative of shape functions with respect to x ϖ is the relaxation factor the solution by eq 12 gives the unknown variables at the new time step here k 1 and k 2 need to be assembled only once for the whole problem domain but the system of linear equations represented by eq 12 must be solved at each time step the equation derived above is solved to obtain head distribution at nodal points using gauss jordan method istok 1989 for the given initial and boundary conditions depending upon the choice of the formulation the following schemes are possible fully explicit scheme ϖ 0 13 k 1 h i t δ t k 1 t δ t s k 3 h i t crank nicolson scheme ϖ 1 2 14 k 1 1 2 t δ t s k 3 h i t δ t k 1 1 2 t δ t s k 3 h i t fully implicit scheme ϖ 1 15 k 1 t δ t s k 3 h i t δ t k 1 h i t in this study fully explicit scheme is adopted and sensitivity analysis is carried out for fully implicit and crank nikolson scheme the solution procedure begins with the specified initial values of h i at time t t o then the system of is solved to obtain the values of h i at the end of time step and the process is repeated for the next time step and so on the flow chart for the model is given in fig 1 4 case study for the verification of pcm gfmc 1d ref section 3 4 1 model flow in homogeneous confined and isotropic medium is considered and compared with the analytical solution for confined aquifer problem given by liggett and liu 1983 the diagrammatic representation of the problem domain is shown in fig 2 the governing equation and formulation for this problem is given in the upper section 3 4 1 the problem domain is defined with the dirichlet boundary conditions with the value of 1m on the western boundary and 0 on the eastern boundary the northern and southern boundaries are no flow boundaries the problem domain is divided into 3 nodes with moving support domain mfree cmcs model is applied to the above problem a time step of 0 05 min is taken total time of simulation is taken as 1 min the problem domain is divided into three four five six and seven nodes fig 3 the moving support domain is used from left to right i e in the direction of flow the size of k1 and k2 matrix is increasing with the number of nodes in the domain the value of transmissibility is takes as 10 m2 d and storage coefficient is taken as 0 03 the support domains used for various node combinations is shown in fig 4 the simulation is carried out for all the node combinations and the results are compared with the analytical solution given by liggett and liu 1983 the comparison of the results is shown in fig 5 it is found that the simulation is in good agreement with the analytical solution the discrepancy in the values is lying in the error band of 10 5 sensitivity analysis it is seen that the results of presented simulation model is in agreement with the analytical solution however to make the model stable and converge fast one needs to see the parameters with which the model is sensitive to for the groundwater flow if hydrogeological parameters like transmissibility and storativity are kept constant then there are three parameters on which the model depends on these are courant number cx inter nodal distance δx and time interval δt a sensitivity analysis is also carried out for the scheme of simulation 5 1 sensitivity of courant number cx the courant number controls oscillations of the numerical solution arising from the temporal discretization with respect to spatial discritization the generally used criteria for the two dimensional problem in x direction is bear 1979 for the given parameters and considering the depth of aquifer as 1 cm the velocity is calculated by darcy s law since groundwater flow is laminar flow the velocity is very low keeping δx constant for the nodal arrangement where δx l 2 the iterations are made for the values of time step as δt 0 05 min δt 0 04 min δt 0 03 min δt 0 03 min and δt 0 01 min it is found that for the value of δt 0 03 courant number is approximately equal to one therefore the variation of courant number with time step is shown in fig 6 5 2 sensitivity of inter nodal distance δx to see the sensitivity of the model with respect to inter nodal distance it is run for δx l 2 δx l 3 δx l 4 δx l 5 and δx l 6 for δt 0 03 min it is found that the error gets reduced with more number of nodes in the domain and consequently in the support domain the error between model result and analytical solution is minimum for δx l 6 it is shown in fig 7 5 3 sensitivity of time step δt to see the sensitivity of the model with respect to time step it is run for δt 0 05min δt 0 04 min δt 0 03 min with various δx values the results are shown in fig 8 it is found that the error between model result and analytical solution is minimum for δt 0 03min for all δx values fig 9 gives the comparison of error for all spatial and temporal variation 5 4 sensitivity of scheme of simulation any numerical simulation can be done in three ways like fully implicit fully explicit and crank nikolson scheme istok 1989 in this study the model is checked for all the three schemes for δx l 2 and δt 0 05min out of three schemes the error between the numerical simulation and analytical solution is plotted in fig 10 it is observed that the error is positive for fully explicit and crank nikolson schemes while it is negative for fully implicit scheme 6 results and discussion since last two decades mfree methods are proved to be effective for solving various engineering problems mfree methods require less computational time since the analysis is done with respect to the particular node in the aquifer pre processing time is saved since there is no grid or mesh mfree collocation methods with various interpolation functions are proved to be effective for the simulation of groundwater flow in this study cubic spline interpolation function is developed and used to simulate groundwater flow the simulation is carried out for a 1d confined aquifer for the stability of groundwater simulation by any numerical method the courant number cx has to be less than or equal to 1 for non oscillating results it depends on the velocity time step and inter nodal distance between the field nodes since groundwater flow is the laminar flow and there is no pumping or recharging the velocity remains constant therefore cx depends on δt and δx values so initially the analysis is conducted to check different δt values such as δt 0 05 min δt 0 04 min δt 0 03 min δt 0 02 min δt 0 01 min for the nodal arrangement with δx l 2 it is found that for δt 0 05 min cx is calculated as 1 709 for δt 0 04 min cx is calculated as 1 336 and for δt 0 03 min the courant number is 0 9845 further it is consistently less than 1 for all nodal arrangements the trials are taken for all the nodal arrangements for δt 0 05 min δt 0 04 min and δt 0 03 min for all these combinations of δx and δt the courant number is less than 1 also error in measurement of groundwater flow piezometric head is reduced with the decrease in δt value it is minimum for all the cases these are shown in fig 7 the trials are also taken for δx l 2 x l 3 δx l 4 δx l 5 and δx l 6 this is to check whether the piezometric heads are sensitive to the number of nodes in the domain and size of the support domain in this study biased support domain is used since the flow is 1d it is found that even though the overall error is not exceeding 10 the model is not much sensitive to number of nodes in the domain and size of the support domain the results are shown in figs 8 and 9 in this study the trials are taken to see whether the models behaves differently for fully explicit crank nikolson or fully implicit schemes it is found that the error become negative for fully implicit scheme and is positive for other two schemes even though the aquifer is not been discharging or recharging groundwater for the transient condition the piezometric heads should increase but with the negative error it is proved that the heads are reducing therefore for predicting the heads for the total time of simulation fully explicit or crank nikolson schemes should be accepted for this study the results are shown in fig 10 with this study it is proved that mfree cmcs as interpolation function can be used for groundwater flow simulation the model is sensitive space and time and also to the size of support domain 7 conclusion groundwater flow analysis is a complex process it is difficult to understand the availability and the exact flow pattern of the groundwater in the porous media numerical models can simulate and predict the piezometric heads below the subsurface mfree methods are be used for their simplicity and less computational time mfree cmcs proved to be effective simple and stable the model is used with the moving support domain for various combinations of δx and δt values to get the courant number less than 1 it is found that the accuracy of model increases with the decrease in δt values however size of support domain and δx values are having less impact on the accuracy for this study explicit and crank nikolson scheme is equally effective for the simulation to sum up it is concluded that mfree cmcs can be used effectively for the simulation of groundwater flow this study declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper

elliptic poisson s equation and showed that mq is an extremely accurate approximation scheme for interpolation and partial derivative estimates for a variety of two dimensional functions over both gridded and scattered data later on this idea was extended to various types of problems by franke and schebak 1997 hon and mao 1998 hon et al 1999 hon and schaback 2001 lorentz et al 2003 wu and hon 2003 and khattak and siraj 2008 mehdi and ali 2007 mategaonkar and eldho 2012 they have found that the choice of radial basis functions is a flexible feature of meshless methods mategaonkar and eldho 2011 2012 developed a mfree pcm model with mq rbf interpolation function for groundwater flow and transport the model was working well for uniform size of the support domain and with the fully implicit scheme however there was a limitation to the model with the field nodes at the end where the uniform size of support domain could not be maintained the gaussian distribution is a continuous function which approximates the exact binomial distribution of events the graph of a gaussian is a characteristic symmetric bell curve shape the inverse of an exponential function is a logarithmic function the logarithmic function has many real life applications in acoustics electronics earthquake analysis and population prediction tps are a method for multidimensional interpolation this interpolation corresponds to an n dimensional interpolation techniques from scattered data it provides a superior approximation of the behaviour of functions that have local abrupt changes the concept of spline is using a thin flexible strip to draw a smooth curve in groundwater flows it is difficult to get the exact data because groundwater travels through fractures in the rock or through areas that are weathered therefore in this study cubic spline function is used as an interpolation function for the simulation of groundwater flow the numerical solution using mfree cmcs compared with the available analytical solution comparison of the results has shown that the model is capable of predicting the groundwater heads high accuracy a case study for 1d groundwater flow is discussed also to make the numerical solution stable and convergent the sensitivity analysis is carried out for courant number inter nodal distance and time steps 2 theoretical development transient groundwater flow in homogeneous confined isotropic media in 1d can be written as bear 1979 1 2 h x 2 s t h t following initial conditions are used for the transient conditions 2 h x o h o x x ω generally the boundary conditions are of three types the prescribed heads flux or both it can be written as 3 h x t h 1 x t x ω 1 4 t h n q x t x ω 2 where h x t is the piezometric head l t is the transmissibility l2t 1 s

eq 1 first step is to fin h i t d the approximation solution h x t i 1 n h i t p i x as liu and gu 2005 where h i is the unknown head and p i is the shape function at node i and n is the total number of nodes in the support domain the value of thin plate spline is given as 6 p i p i n therefore 7 p i x n p i n 1 a n d 2 p i x 2 n n 1 p i n 2 where p i x x i and for cs n 3 3 1 time domain discretization based upon the numerical experiments conducted many researchers it is concluded that the finite difference scheme in time is the best overall choice in the majority of transient analysis ence to account for the time derivative following forward finite difference approximation is used in this study pinder and gray 1977 and wang and anderson 1982 i e 8 h t h i t δ t h i t δ t therefore eq 1 becomes 9 t δ t s 2 h i x 2 t δ t h i t δ t h t from eqs 1 7 and 8 eq 9 can be written as 10 t δ t s 2 p i x x 2 h i t δ t p i x h t δ t p i x h t or 11 p i x t δ t s 2 p i x x 2 h i t δ t p i x h t p i x and 2 p i x x 2 values are calculated for all the support domains shape function have kroneccker delta property liu and gu 2005 i e the value of shape function outside the support domain is zero all these values of shape functions and their derivatives are then incorporated in the global matrix for the whole problem domain therefore the general system of eq 11 can be written as istok 1989 12 k 1 ϖ t δ t s k 2 h i t δ t k 1 1 ϖ t δ t s k 2 h i t where k 1 global matrix for shape function k 2 global matrix for second derivative of shape functions with respect to x ϖ is the relaxation factor the solution by eq 12 gives the unknown variables at the new time step here k 1 and k 2 need to be assembled only once for the whole problem domain but the system of linear equations represented by eq 12 must be solved at each time step the equation derived above is solved to obtain head distribution at nodal points using gauss jordan method istok 1989 for the given initial and boundary conditions depending upon the choice of the formulation the following schemes are possible fully explicit scheme ϖ 0 13 k 1 h i t δ t k 1 t δ t s k 3 h i t crank nicolson scheme ϖ 1 2 14 k 1

out for fully implicit and crank nikolson scheme the solution procedure begins with the specified initial values of h i at time t t o then the system of is solved to obtain the values of h i at the end of time step and the process is repeated for the next time step and so on the flow chart for the model is given in fig 1 4 case study for the verification of pcm gfmc 1d ref section 3 4 1 model flow in homogeneous confined and isotropic medium is considered and compared with the analytical solution for confined aquifer problem given by liggett and liu 1983 the diagrammatic representation of the problem domain is shown in fig 2 the governing equation and formulation for this problem is given in the upper section 3 4 1 the problem domain is defined with the dirichlet boundary conditions with the value of 1m on the western boundary and 0 on the eastern boundary the northern and southern boundaries are no flow boundaries the problem domain is divided into 3 nodes with moving support domain mfree cmcs model is applied to the above problem a time step of 0 05 min is taken total time of simulation is taken as 1 min the problem domain is divided into three four five six and seven nodes fig 3 the moving support domain is used from left to right i e in the direction of flow the size of k1 and k2 matrix is increasing with the number of nodes in the domain the value of transmissibility is takes as 10 m2 d and storage coefficient is taken as 0 03 the support domains used for various node combinations is shown in fig 4 the simulation is carried out for all the node combinations and the results are compared with the analytical solution given by liggett and liu 1983 the comparison of the results is shown in fig 5 it is found that the simulation is in good agreement with the analytical solution the discrepancy in the values is lying in the error band of 10 5 sensitivity analysis it is seen that the results of presented simulation model is in agreement with the analytical solution however to make the model stable and converge fast one needs to see the parameters with which the model is sensitive to for the groundwater flow if hydrogeological parameters like transmissibility and storativity are kept constant then there are three parameters on which the model depends on these are courant number cx inter nodal distance δx and time interval δt a sensitivity analysis is also carried out for the scheme of simulation 5 1 sensitivity of courant number cx the courant number controls oscillations of the numerical solution arising from the temporal discretization with respect to spatial discritization the generally used criteria for the two dimensional problem in x direction is bear 1979 for the given parameters and considering the depth of aquifer as 1 cm the velocity is calculated by darcy s law since groundwater flow is laminar flow the velocity is very low keeping δx constant for the nodal arrangement where δx l 2 the iterations are made for the values of time step as δt 0 05 min δt 0 04 min δt 0 03 min δt 0 03 min and δt 0 01 min it is found that for the value of δt 0 03 courant number is approximately equal to one therefore the variation of courant number with time step is shown in fig 6 5 2 sensitivity of inter nodal distance δx to see the sensitivity of the model with respect to inter nodal distance it is run for δx l 2 δx l 3 δx l 4 δx l 5 and δx l 6 for δt 0 03 min it is found that the error gets reduced with more number of nodes in the domain and consequently in the support domain the error between model result and analytical solution is minimum for δx l 6 it is shown in fig 7 5 3 sensitivity of time step δt to see the sensitivity of the model with respect to time step it is run for δt 0 05min δt 0 04 min δt 0 03 min with various δx values the results are shown in fig 8 it is found that the error between model result and analytical solution is minimum for δt 0 03min for all δx values fig 9 gives the comparison of error for all spatial and temporal variation 5 4 sensitivity of scheme of simulation any numerical simulation can be done in three ways like fully implicit fully explicit and crank nikolson scheme istok 1989 in this study the model is checked for all the three schemes for δx l 2 and δt 0 05min out of three schemes the error between the numerical simulation and analytical solution is plotted in fig 10 it is observed that the error is positive for fully explicit and crank nikolson schemes while it is negative for fully implicit scheme 6 results and discussion since last two decades mfree methods are proved to be effective for solving various engineering problems mfree methods require less computational time since the analysis is done with respect to the particular node in the aquifer pre processing time is saved since there is no grid or mesh mfree collocation methods with various interpolation functions are proved to be effective for the simulation of groundwater flow in this study cubic spline interpolation function is developed and used to simulate groundwater flow the simulation is carried out for a 1d confined aquifer for the stability of groundwater simulation by any numerical method the courant number cx has to be less than or equal to 1 for non oscillating results it depends on the velocity time step and inter nodal distance between the field nodes since groundwater flow is the laminar flow and there is no pumping or recharging the velocity remains constant therefore cx depends on δt and δx values so initially the analysis is conducted to check different δt values such as δt 0 05 min δt 0 04 min δt 0 03 min δt 0 02 min δt 0 01 min for the nodal arrangement with δx l 2 it is found that for δt 0 05 min cx is calculated as 1 709 for δt 0 04 min cx is calculated as 1 336 and for δt 0 03 min the courant number is 0 9845 further it is consistently less than 1 for all nodal arrangements the trials are taken for all the nodal arrangements for δt 0 05 min δt 0 04 min and δt 0 03 min for all these combinations of δx and δt the courant number is less than 1 also error in measurement of groundwater flow piezometric head is reduced with the decrease in δt value it is minimum for all the cases these are shown in fig 7 the trials are also taken for δx l 2 x l 3 δx l 4 δx l 5 and δx l 6 this is to check whether the piezometric heads are sensitive to the number of nodes in the domain and size of the support domain in this study biased support domain is used since the flow is 1d it is found that even though the overall error is not exceeding 10 the model is not much sensitive to number of nodes in the domain and size of the support domain the results are shown in figs 8 and 9 in this study the trials are taken to see whether the models behaves differently for fully explicit crank nikolson or fully implicit schemes it is found that the error become negative for fully implicit scheme and is positive for other two schemes even though the aquifer is not been discharging or recharging groundwater for the transient condition the piezometric heads should increase but with the negative error it is proved that the heads are reducing therefore for predicting the heads for the total time of simulation fully explicit or crank nikolson schemes should be accepted for this study the results are shown in fig 10 with this study it is proved that mfree cmcs as interpolation function can be used for groundwater flow simulation the model is sensitive space and time and also to the size of support domain 7 conclusion groundwater flow analysis is a complex process it is difficult to understand the availability and the exact flow pattern of the groundwater in the porous media numerical models can simulate and predict the piezometric heads below the subsurface mfree methods are be used for their simplicity and less computational time mfree cmcs proved to be effective simple and stable the model is used with the moving support domain for various combinations of δx and δt values to get the courant number less than 1 it is found that the accuracy of model increases with the decrease in δt values however size of support domain and δx values are having less impact on the accuracy for this study explicit and crank nikolson scheme is equally effective for the simulation to sum up it is concluded that mfree cmcs can be used effectively for the simulation of groundwater flow this study declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper
