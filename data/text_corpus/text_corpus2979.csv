14895,the issue of freshwater salinization in coastal areas has grown in importance with the increase of the demand of groundwater supply and the more frequent droughts however the spatial patterns of salinity contamination are not easy to be understood as well as their numerical modeling is subject to various kinds of uncertainty this paper offers a robust flexible and reliable geostatistical methodology to provide a stochastic assessment of salinity distribution in alluvial coastal areas the methodology is applied to a coastal aquifer in campania italy where 83 monitoring wells provided depth averaged salinity data a monte carlo mc framework was implemented to simulate depth averaged groundwater salinity fields both mc stochastic fields and the mean across mc simulations enabled to the delineation of which areas are subject to high salinity then a probabilistic approach was developed setting up salinity thresholds for agricultural use to delineate the areas with unsuitable groundwater for irrigation purposes furthermore steady spatial patterns of saline wedge lengths were unveiled through uncertainty estimates of seawater ingression at the volturno river mouth the results were compared versus a calibrated numerical model with remarkable model fit r2 0 96 and versus an analytical solution obtaining similar wedge lengths the results pointed out that the high groundwater salinities found inland more than 2 km from the coastline could be ascribed to trapped paleo seawater rather than to actual seawater intrusion in fact the inland high salinities were in correspondence of thick peaty layers which can store trapped saline waters because of their high porosity and low permeability furthermore these results are consistent with the recognition of depositional environments and the position of ancient lagoon alluvial sediments located in the same areas where are the highest simulated salinity fields this robust probabilistic approach could be applied to similar alluvial coastal areas to understand spatial patterns of present salinization to disentangle actual from paleo seawater intrusion and more in general to delineate zones with unsuitable salinity for irrigation purposes keywords salinization aquifers geostatistics trapped seawater saline wedge data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction groundwater salinization in coastal aquifers is a long term issue in hydrogeology custodio 1988 bear et al 1999 barlow 2003 but with the increasing water demand due to population growth and the accelerating climatic change that triggered prolonged water crises scattered around the world the attention on coastal groundwater resources recently peaked these factors have boosted the research of this topic using different approaches combining the classical hydrogeological and hydrochemical characterization tools with stable isotopes kim et al 2007 de montety et al 2008 cary et al 2015 caschetto et al 2017 or adding geophysical methods de franco et al 2009 rasmussen et al 2013 trabelsi et al 2013 carol et al 2021a or coupling the investigation with density dependent flow and transport numerical models comte and banton 2007 koukadaki et al 2007 meyer et al 2019 those methods often provide insight into salinization processes e g distinguishing among actual and paleo seawater intrusion delsman et al 2014 zhao et al 2017 bauer et al 2022 but they suffer from high quality datasets need like high resolution multi level samplers isotopes analyses or expensive geophysical equipment rarely available except in small and highly characterized areas to overcome these common issues several empirical indices have been formulated in gis environment to assess the vulnerability of coastal aquifers to salinization tomaszkiewicz et al 2014 trabelsi et al 2016 motevalli et al 2019 kazakis et al 2019 even with spatial prediction including climate changes klassen and allen 2017 busico et al 2021 nevertheless interpolation among poorly characterized variables like hydraulic conductivity or chloride concentrations may produce large uncertainties in the vulnerability maps thus many of the above mentioned authors suggest taking particular care during the geostatistical analysis of input variables to estimate salinity concentrations across a given study area in fact determining high salinity areas via geostatistical methods is usually simpler than using numerical models to achieve the same result whereas the former is much simpler the latter needs proper boundary conditions set up and calibration which may not be a simple task but often provide the most robust and reliable methods to estimate and quantify the groundwater salinity distribution mastrocicco and colombani 2021 the employment of artificial intelligence algorithms in recent years have added a novel approach which use the groundwater quality data alagha et al 2017 taşan et al 2022 often referred to as surrogate modeling tools artificial intelligence algorithms have shown acceptable performance in simulating complex hydrogeological processes and when scarce data do not allow to build up numerical models trichakis et al 2011 nevertheless artificial intelligence algorithms suffer the problem of large uncertainties in the produced maps if the training dataset is not well distributed in space and time to date stochastic modelling has been applied to many hydrogeological contexts fiori et al 2015 banusch et al 2022 schiavo et al 2022 but still encounters large resistance to become a standardized practice sanchez vila and fernàndez garcia 2016 most of the studies on coastal groundwater salinization approach this issue from the modeling side while few works frame a geostatistical approach as recently reviewed by panagiotou et al 2022 and those treating the problem from the stochastic viewpoint are still a minority pool et al 2015 for example abu al naeem et al 2018 employed a combined geostatistical and hydrogeochemical methodology to assess the extension and origins of highly salinized areas in palestine although without using a stochastic framework finally a recent work of jamei et al 2022 has analyzed the salinization of groundwater resources in a multi aquifer system in bangladesh via hybrid artificial intelligence algorithms complemented with a monte carlo approach but only to avoid parameters overfitting the present work aims to exploit further points that previous geostatistical oriented works on aquifer salinization did not highlight here the aim is not only to assess salinization patterns in areas where human and agricultural uses of freshwater resources are relevant but also to produce simulated salinity fields to approach the problem from a stochastic point of view in particular the present work is centered on stochastic modelling of salinity simulated fields upon a sequential methodology employing sparce groundwater salinity data to assess the probability that a certain area is contaminated by an over threshold of salinity and to uncertainly evaluate if this area is connected or not with neighboring ones this analysis may inform water managers about the spatial source and probable connections of salinity concentrations and to quantitatively estimate the probability of an area of being affected by a certain salinity threshold in order to fully understand and frame different processes that might be involved in salinization issues the volturno river mouth area italy has been selected to test whether stochastic modeling fulfills the aim of i reproducing the saline ingression alongside major rivers or in the proximity of lakes e g lake patria ii evaluating the saline wedge intrusion uncertainties at different locations respect to a numerical model and an analytical solution and iii appraising the probable extension of highly salinized areas while seeking for the hydrogeological consistency with geological models and available stratigraphic data the major novelty of this study is that the proposed stochastic interpolation approach has a fast computing time a simple setup with respect to any density dependent numerical model and needs fewer data than the latter and the results may come up consistent with the widest variety of information sources from paleo geological to geological or to numerical ones besides the present work aims to propose a simplified but robust framework to be employed in other alluvial coastal areas in the world affected by both actual and paleo seawater intrusion problems 2 methodology 2 1 available data and study area the coastal unconfined aquifer to test this methodology is the terminal part of the floodplain belonging to the volturno river mouth which is located within the campania plain southern italy fig 1 the entire campania plain has notable economic and ecological values due to the presence of many farm activities touristic structures and wetland protected zones such as the variconi oasis the volturno river coastal plain is located within a large extensional sedimentary basin that developed during the quaternary and is still actively subsiding its margins are set among the western arc of the southern apennines and the eastern tyrrhenian margin matano et al 2014 the actual geomorphological features are a combination of the late holocene sedimentary evolution and anthropic interventions like urban settlements expansion land reclamation works and intensive agriculture busico et al 2021 the selected study area has a rectangular shape with the major axis oriented along the shoreline is bordered at north by the agnena river and at south by the regi lagni reclamation canal and its mean ground elevation ranges from 2 0 to 4 0 m above sea level a s l at the center of the area lies the terminal part of the volturno river while semipermanent water bodies lagoons and wetlands like the patria lake sacchi et al 2014 are scattered along the coast the unconfined coastal aquifer is hosted in actual and paleo dune sandy deposits crossed by several fluvial paleochannels that are interlayered with silty and peaty lenses amorosi et al 2012 a pro delta unit formed by silty clay sediments is present from 16 to 21 m a s l it represents the local aquiclude of the unconfined coastal aquifer zanchetta et al 2004 fig 1 the study area corresponds to the area of maximum seawater expansion inland during the last holocenic deglaciation dated back to 6 5 ky before present sacchi et al 2014 surface waters and groundwater samples were collected in a sampling campaign in september 2019 on 60 monitoring stations fig 1 and analyzed in the field for salinity measurements using a portable multiparameter probe hi 9828 hanna instruments the domain of the numerical model previously developed by mastrocicco et al 2019 and here employed to compare the present work s results is highlighted by a yellow box panel a 2 2 groundwater setting salinization patterns and the link with agricultural practices groundwater flowlines orthogonally flow from inland areas toward the coastline mostly following the path of major rivers and with prevailing pattern of submarine groundwater discharge over seawater intrusion along the whole campania region gaiolini et al 2022 this consideration highlights the importance of understanding salinization patterns along surface water bodies to assess i their possible role in vehiculating seawater intrusion or conversely ii to highlight areas with hazardous salinity which are connected through the aquifer body with the surface network the area near to the volturno river is characterized by slightly saline groundwater inland and in proximity to the coast and by reducing conditions due to presence of peaty lenses corniello and ducci 2014 groundwater is characterized by sodium absorption ratio and ec values from medium to extremely high making most of the coastal groundwater unsuitable for irrigation mastrocicco et al 2021 the vulnerability to the actual seawater intrusion extent has been recently estimated via a weighting and rating method busico et al 2021 here the highest vulnerability was clearly found along the entire coastline but very high vulnerability zones were also found along the terminal branches of volturno and agnena rivers up to 4 0 km from the river mouth in fact their riverbeds are located below the tyrrenian sea level possibly promoting seawater encroachment 2 3 paleolagoon and depositional environments recently ruberti et al 2022 have unravelled the paleo reconstruction of the volturno river coastal plain during the quaternary they found that the volturno coastal plain evolution was driven by sediment supply and global eustatic variations during the holocene briefly the mediterranean sea level rise created a paleo gulf extending up to 10 km inland between 6 5 4 5 ka bp then a late stage progradation 4 5 ka bp was accompanied by the development of a paleo coastal lagoon system that persisted up to the roman age aiello et al 2018 the associated beach dune system and coastal lagoons have been relatively stable since the roman time until early 1800 when a large land reclamation was established and the former roman clanio river was channelized and renamed regi lagni along with more than 500 km of channels and ditches amorosi et al 2012 sacchi et al 2014 the continental depositional facies comprise the volturno fluvial system characterized by medium coarse sand and gravel paleochannels passing to silty sand and grey blue clay floodplain deposits and peat ruberti et al 2022 while the bayhead deltaic depositional facies comprise a transgressive barrier with medium and fine sands interfingered with clay and thick back barrier peaty sediments characterized by high subsidence rates due to presence of peaty lenses and silty clay deposits especially in the area between the agnena and volturno rivers busico et al 2021 located in the north eastern sector of the study area fig 1 2 4 stochastic modeling of salinity fields the investigation domain was discretized in squared cells of 0 1 km for a total amount of approximately 3 10 5 cells each i th cell barycenter is identified by its geographical coordinates x i x i y i depth average salinity values were identified by each borehole coordinate x n x n y n a variogram analysis goovaerts 1997 chiles and delfiner 2009 was performed to study the spatial correlation of depth averaged measured salinity values throughout the domain this analysis served to model salinity spatial correlation and to simulate a different random value for each i th domain site see section 3 1 as a first step the existence of 2d anisotropies was studied by employing directional variograms on the available dataset since no preferential directions emerged for data spatial correlation an omnidirectional variogram model was employed to interpret the spatial distribution of this dataset once this step was achieved a proper variogram model was calibrated using a best fitting gaussian function deutsch and journel 1997 to be used for the simulation of stochastic fields of the variable of interest stochastic conditional depth averaged salinity fields rely upon the dataset described in section 2 1 an isotropic omnidirectional variogram function isaaks and srivastava 1989 was chosen to interpret the dataset spatial correlation 1 γ h σ n 2 exp 1 3 h 2 a 2 where h x x is the separation distance between vector locations x and x for each n th borehole of the dataset σ n 2 and a are model parameters corresponding to the variogram sill and range respectively the former was estimated as the variance of the n available data while the latter was estimated via a maximum likelihood ml approach with best estimated range of 2 5 km and a 95 confidence interval between lower and upper bounds of 0 3 km then a very well know and widely applied geostatistical methodology sequential gaussian simulations sgsim deutsch and journel 1997 remy and boucher 2009 was employed to achieve sequential continuous fields of depth averaged salinity concentration this enabled to move from the discrete characterization of local salinity that the dataset provided to the continuous stochastic representation of the same variable stochastic values are therefore associated with each cell barycenter embedded by as many as the simulations were performed then the results were collected within a monte carlo mc framework to be treated as a simulations ensemble three uses of mc salinization fields were performed i considering them one by one as random fields with locally varying spatial patterns ii thresholding each random field upon one or more salinity values hence embedding each salinity value as a logical variable 0 or 1 if the prescribed threshold was met or not and iii considering the local mean across simulations ensemble to have the most probable one since the mean coincides with the most probable value if the spatial distribution of the latter is gaussian this moved the analysis toward the domain of probabilities this can be explained by introducing an indicator variable as follows 2 i r x i 1 i f c r x i t h r 0 i f c r x i t h r w i t h r 1 r r 1 r being each mc simulation c r x i the local simulated salinity concentration value at the i th cell of the r th realization and i r x i is the value of i x i in realization r of the ensemble then χ x i was computed as 3 χ x i 1 r r 1 r i r x i q r q an integer between 1 and r being the number of mc simulations where the indicator is equal to one at the i th location therefore the indicator i x i is a random variable that follows a bernoulli distribution with probability χ x i given by pr i x i 1 χ x i such a probabilistic approach schiavo 2022a enables to stochastically assess local probabilities of saline concentrations and look for areas most likely to be contaminated a geological section named section aa in fig 1 already introduced by ruberti et al 2022 was employed to appraise the hydrogeological consistency between the mc salinity fields and the conceptualization of the hydrogeological setting of the area this analysis was extended to additional transects along major rivers volturno river and the regi lagni canal and the coastline profile to understand what the probability of a certain salinity does look like analytical solutions for the depth averaged estimation of the width of the saline wedge inland were employed as reported in beebe et al 2016 and references therein these results were used to verify the consistency of the stochastic saline wedge width along the whole coastline with a particular interest in the volturno river mouth fig 1 here the mc results were compared with those inferred by a variable density numerical groundwater flow and transport model previously published by mastrocicco et al 2019 and performed near the volturno river mouth within a small portion of the actual study domain briefly the seawat model set up consisted of a squared area of 1 5 km2 yellow square in fig 1a discretized in a regular spaced grid of 10 10 m and 12 layers of different thicknesses enclosing the local ground surface and the top of the prodelta silty clay unit different flow and transport packages were used to fully define the system the time variant specified head boundary package was used to represent the regional freshwater flow boundary and the tyrrhenian sea boundary the river package was employed to simulate the volturno river the recharge and the evapotranspiration packages were also used the seawat model was calibrated versus measured pressure heads and salinities the squared correlation coefficient r2 taylor 1997 and the nash sutcliffe efficiency index nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 are employed to assess the correlation between the model and present results 3 results 3 1 salinity fields monte carlo realizations stochastic conditional salinity fields rely upon the dataset described in section 2 1 and the variogram modeling described in section 2 2 a collection of mc realizations of salinity fields was generated as previously described in section 2 2 a series of 2500 simulations run was necessary to reach the numerical stability of first statistical moments for the simulated salinity at each cell across progressive mc realizations details not shown in fig 2 exemplary stochastic mc salinity fields are illustrated 3 2 salinity agricultural related thresholds to assess hazardous areas two different salinity thresholds 1 5 and 2 5 g l have been applied to each mc realization since most agricultural crops show yield reduction at 1 5 g l and become substantially affected over 2 5 g l katerji et al 2003 each salinity field realization enables to delineate the areas where the employed threshold is exceeded or not the higher the threshold the narrower the areas where the threshold is exceeded hence spatial patterns of salinization fields must be investigated if different areas with salinity higher than the prescribed threshold are connected or not fig 3 illustrates the application of the two thresholds to the mc salinity realizations depicted in fig 1 the areas with a mc simulated salinity higher than 1 5 g l are depicted in light red while those where the concentration is higher than 2 5 g l are depicted in red the areas where salinity concentrations are higher than employed thresholds spread through the outback being limited to a few clusters of modest width along the coastline zone some connections can be assessed if the lower of the two thresholds is employed being interrupted if the higher threshold is used this suggests that the inland s high salinity concentrations are clustered in some areas with poor mutual connections between each other and the sea as the main salinity source even such a rough connectivity appraisal may lead to the hypothesis that the tyrrenian sea is the major salinity source in the coastline zone while the inland s source is likely to be different from the actual seawater intrusion ensembling all the mc salinity fields the most probable salinity concentration field can be achieved when the mean across each mc realizations is performed at each domain cell the resulting average salinity field is reported in fig 4 panel a in panels b and c of fig 4 the probability fields retrieved by employing salinity thresholds of 1 5 and 2 5 g l are illustrated as discussed for fig 3 the higher the threshold the narrower are the areas embedded by high χ x i as probability values of exceedance the imposed threshold 3 3 large scale geological consistency of salinity and probability fields a large scale appraisal of the geological consistency of the stochastic approach here proposed can be assessed through the juxtaposition of an available geological map matano et al 2018 of the area with the mean concentration field fig 4 panel a and that depicting the probability of having a local concentration higher or equal than 1 5 g l fig 4 panel b as illustrated by fig 5 in panel a panel b in fig 5 enables to appraise which sediment type hosts the highest average saline concentration within the study area dashed green and magenta lines highlight concentration thresholds of 1 5 and 2 5 g l see panels b and c in fig 4 respectively the highest concentration can be assessed where lacustrine peaty and clayey deposits depicted in light gray blue are prevalent while aeolian ones located along the coastline have the lowest concentration the second sediment facies with the highest salinity concentration are alluvial sediments depicted in blue which are a mix of silt sand and clay lenses panel c in fig 5 enables to correlate the sediment type with the probability of having a saline concentration higher than 1 5 g l the highest probability can be assessed where lacustrine peaty and clayey deposits are prevalent depicted in light gray blue while sandy permeable aeolian ones depicted in light orange located along the coastline have the lowest probability of being contaminated by saline concentrations larger than 1 5 g l the second sediment facies with the highest probability of being contaminated by concentrations larger than 1 5 g l are alluvial sediments depicted in blue which are a mix of silt sand and clay lenses 3 4 hydrogeological consistency of salinity fields a more detailed assessment of the salinization in particular areas of the domain can be done if both the concentration and the probability of exceeding a threshold are investigated therefore 4 transects are delineated see fig 1 to be inspected i one along the volturno river thalweg ii one along the regi lagni canal thalweg iii one along the coastline with the aim of understanding the seawater wedge penetrating inland and iv one along a geological section to inspect for the geological consistency of the salinization spatial fields here proposed both panels in fig 6 are dedicated to this task fig 6 panels illustrate the average salinity concentration field from a to d and the probability χ x i from e to h of having a local value higher than 1 5 g l along the volturno river panels a and e the regi lagni canal panels b and f the coastline panels c and g and the geological section aa panels d and h respectively the salinity probability profiles fig 6 indicate elevated salinities in the proximity of the coastline as one can expect due to actual seawater intrusion after being mostly neglected moving inland both the salinity and the probability profiles highlight an abrupt increase at more than 5 km from the coastline this evidence strengthens the thesis that the high inland salinity concentration does not depend on the salinity of the sea or on the effect of the saline wedge inland penetration but rather depends on relict paleo seawater trapped within highly porous clayey soil layers this behavior can be appraised also from panels b and f where the highest salinity and probability values in the proximity of the sea and 6 7 km inland respectively seem to be poorly connected by low counterparts located from 2 to 5 km form the coastline as well as the probability of high salinity values from 2 to 5 km inland are very low as one can appraise by comparing the latter panels with panels b and c in fig 4 furthermore panels c and g in fig 6 reveal that salinity and probability peaks along the coastline are in proximity of major surface water bodies the three salinity peaks detected from panel c in fig 6 can be associated to the volturno river regi lagni canal and lake patria in the southern part of the domain see fig 1 respectively the latter water body is well connected to the tyrrhenian sea through a cemented channel and is characterized by high salinity this local salinization pattern is however poorly correlated with the surrounding salinity values see also fig 4 s panels suggesting a localized salinity pattern that may not affect the surrounding inland aquifer due to the poor connection of the patria lakebed consisting of silty clay sediments with the coastal aquifer sacchi et al 2014 panels d and h in fig 6 suggest that the highest salinity values as well as the highest probabilities of having over threshold concentrations are in areas where thick organic clayey layers are identified busico et al 2021 ruberti et al 2022 strengthening the idea that inland salinity may be likely to depend on trapped paleo seawater rather than actual seawater intrusion 3 5 ancient quaternary lagoon consistency of simulated salinization patterns the highest values of simulated salinity achieved from the mean across mc realization of local salinity are concentrated where the back barrier peaty depositional facies are located which is consistent with the palaeogeographical evolution of the area depicted in fig 7 the nature of these depositional facies rules local circulation patterns within the subsurface as well as water flow energy dissipation hence being useful to inform about salinization processes other footholds to the proposed thesis can be retrieved if water table measurements sourced from gaiolini et al 2022 are compared with salinization values and divided for different depositional environments the latter environments are illustrated in fig 8 and referring to areas depicted in fig 6 lacustrine aeolian pyroclastic and alluvial sediment areas in panels a b c and d respectively the highest values of water table are measured within lacustrine or alluvial depositional environments the lowest where pyroclastic and aeolian sediments are located aeolian sediments are well acknowledged see e g ruberti et al 2022 for being in connection with the coastline as indicated by lower water table levels than their lacustrine counterparts on the contrary the lacustrine environment is characterized by water table levels higher than the sea level of 2 3 m on average hence being disconnected from the sea therefore the latter one is the most likely to trap paleo seawater being geologically see section 3 3 and hydrogeologically see section 3 4 disconnected by the present seawater intrusion 3 6 assessing the role of the present seawater from a stochastic point of view at this point it is interesting to quantify the inland penetration of the tyrrenian sea to understand its role in the salinization of coastal aquifers it is pivotal to assess if the connection with high salinity values far from the coastline may be associated within a probabilistic framework to those in the proximity of the tyrrhenian sea this can be done within the present stochastic approach by taking each of the mc realizations and plotting the width of the saline wedge along the tyrrhenian sea coastline the results are illustrated in fig 9 in panel a each of the r th realizations corresponds to a blue line while the mean across these is the red line the latter informs that the maximum inland saline penetration from the sea occurs at the mouth of the volturno river with a mean value of 520 m this result is confirmed by the application of analytical solutions fig 9 panel b commonly used for the evaluation of the maximum width of the saline wedge in coastal aquifers werner et al 2013 beebe et al 2016 upon hydrogeological data on the aquifer under investigation mastrocicco et al 2021 the reliability of the present approach can be sustained by comparison with the latest available numerical model calibrated for a portion of the domain the mean across the mc salinization fields is correlated with that inferred from a seawat langevin et al 2007 numerical simulation calibrated by mastrocicco et al 2019 in an area located at the volturno river mouth the comparison performed between the numerical calibrated model and the present work s results are reported in fig 10 panel a as well as their correlation appraised via r2 and nse index coefficient see section 2 while statistics regarding the similarity of statistical moments are reported in panel b the mean across the mc salinity fields slightly overestimated local salinity values in particular medium ones returning an overall very good outcome 0 96 an nse of 0 74 reveals a good consistency between the two models spatial salinity fields the ratios of the first statistical moments with σ as the standard deviation s as the skewness and k as kurtosis evaluated between the model mod subscript and the average salinity field mc subscript are fair enough to give credit to the results here presented the latter ratios are enough to regard the two populations of local salinity values i e the modeled and the mean across the mc ones as statistically mutually consistent the uncertainty related to the approach here employed as well as the one related to data uncertainty and kriging parameters see e g athens and caers 2022 schiavo 2022b should be investigated for a deeper assessment 3 7 geostatistical variograms all the proposed results have stemmed from a geostatistical methodology hence they need to be recovered to the initial viewpoint for a complete process understanding fig 11 depicts experimental variograms retrieved for salinity values see fig 4 and panels therein measured at wells locations for 30 in orange and 120 in green degrees principal directions along those the domain has been oriented each directional variogram shows experimental points within the normal score space goovaerts 1997 with a red dashed line highlighting the experimental variance hence equal to 1 and a shadowed box highlighting the experimental data range of variation i e the range of possible distances needed to reach a lack of spatial correlation between randomly taken points although the present results fully rely upon the usage of an omnidirectional variogram which is needed to retrieve the spatial variation of the variable of interest for the whole domain without preferential directionalities schiavo 2022a for an application with the same issue the inspection of directional variograms may be of interest to understand how salinity varies along principal axes as fig 11 illustrates the range of lags for reaching the sill along a 30 deg direction is double about 7 km that along the 120 deg one about 3 5 km while the former rules the variation of salinity fields hence of the mean across the mc realizations as illustrated in fig 4 panel a with the domain s width the latter reproduces that along the coastline or parallel directions this means that salinity fields varying across the domain s width are far more correlated than those along the coastline where high values of salinity are present in some hotspots such as river mouths but highly mutually disconnected see the sparsity of reddish areas along the coastline in fig 4 panel a moreover the variability of experimental points variances horizontal blue arrows for the 120 deg direction green dots on the sill vertical black arrows abruptly changes within narrow distances twice of the experimental variance as one may appraise from short lagged experimental points conversely most of the points within the range of variation of the sill for the 30 deg directional variogram orange dots are characterized by lower changes in experimental variances about a half of the experimental variance especially for distances between points higher than 2 3 km large or narrow changes in experimental variance for experimental variogram points along a certain direction implies an even larger or narrower non linear variation in local simulated salinity since local values would disclose to the mean salinity i e embedded with a standard deviation with the square root of the variance short lagged points are embedded by experimental variances significantly more varying with the lag than those located at distances higher than 2 3 km and far less correlated than those these geostatistical consistency sources are consistent with discontinuous patterns of salinity from the coastline with inland areas inferred in section 3 1 4 discussion this work presents a stochastic approach to model saline occurrence in coastal alluvial aquifers the aim of the present work is to frame a complex hydrogeological problem to offer a stochastic approach a robust geostatistical methodology and a real case study application strengthened by several proofs about the consistency of the employed approach coming from different sources geological hydrogeological salinization processes based this methodology starts from observed depth averaged salinity concentrations collected within the volturno river floodplain area grounding on a well acknowledged geostatistical simulation method the present approach enables to retrieve monte carlo simulations of salinization concentrations in each location of a regularly gridded domain which is preliminarily considered as bi dimensional the numerical results are offered as i stochastic salinity fields ii mean concentration fields obtained as the average across the mc ensemble and iii maps with the local probability that the average simulated salinity exceeds a threshold value the importance of uncertain spatial evaluation of salinization areas is fundamental to assess where groundwater resources are suitable for human or agricultural uses bierkens and wada 2019 the results shown in sections 3 1 and 3 2 highlight that the highest salinization values are located i along the coastline suggesting actual seawater intrusion or ii far inland as isolated clusters embedded by very low probability of being connected with the present coastline the latter salinized areas are the source of most of the concerns because of the high density of human and agricultural related activities in the area the gathered information suggests that these salination clusters depend on paleo trapped seawater this thesis is supported by multiple footholds which can be divided in different groups section 3 3 deepens how high inland salinization values are mostly located where lacustrine and alluvial sediments geologically disconnected by the coastline are located section 3 4 show the hydrogeological setting of inland salinized areas which are likely of being disconnected from the coastline along major river body tracks coastline and geological sections of interest suggesting a negligible probability of the interaction of present seawater inland these analyses are also supported by the fact that apart from those located along the coastline the highest salinized wells are located where the aquifer thickness is enough at least 25 30 m within lacustrine or alluvial sedimentary geological zones to include peaty clayey lenses which are highly likely of being able to trap paleo seawater as reported and discussed in section 3 5 moreover the hydraulics of these areas confirm these suggestions since the highest salinized wells are located where low and spatially constant water table levels are measured and local hydraulic gradients are very low in these areas the local water table levels are however higher than the sea level hence being clearly hydraulically disconnected from the seawater furthermore salinization patterns appear to be intimately related to different kinds of depositional environments as reported in sections 3 3 and 3 5 in addition a paleo geological analysis suggest that the ancient lagoon environment is trapping paleo seawater responsible for the present inland hazardous salinization as proposed by previous paleo geological literature works see section 3 6 moreover a supplementary geostatistical analysis section 3 8 supports this by detecting precise spatial patterns through variograms directionality analysis of inland salinization the same salinization patterns also occur in other areas in the mediterranean area mastrocicco and colombani 2021 and worldwide wang and jiao 2012 carol et al 2021b where groundwater and seawater interface positions are a result of late quaternary paleoenvironmental conditions with evaporites dissolution in back barrier environments which creates brines even at shallow depths delsman et al 2014 liu et al 2017 caschetto et al 2017 finally in section 3 7 the inland penetration length of the present seawater wedge is estimated of being lower than 0 5 km along the entire coastline with an expected maximum at the mouth of the major river of the area volturno river these analyses performed with a stochastic approach are consistent with analytical solutions which are more commonly used for these purposes and with the latest available numerical models calibrated for the investigated area supporting the present thesis 5 conclusions a stochastic framework has been proposed to investigate coastal aquifers salinization and assess most vulnerable areas the core of this study is the sequential simulation of salinity fields the results achieved from simulations ensemble treated from a probabilistic perspective are consistent with previous datasets a wide variety of consistency sources and available simulations key points of the present work can be summarized as follows i highest salinities are located at the mouth of the main rivers or far inland the latter as isolated clusters the probabilistic analysis suggests a different origin for these two salinization phenomena since no probable spatial connection exists between the former and the latter ii the study of over threshold salinities allowed to appraise which areas are more likely of being affected becoming unsuitable for human freshwater supply or agriculture use iii inland high salinity concentrations are located where relevant peaty layers are framed within the subsurface water bodies this strengthened the hypothesis that the inland salinities arise from trapped paleo seawater rather than from actual seawater intrusion iv the stochastic approach enabled to have a reliable appraisal of the inland penetration of the saline wedge along the whole coastline the highest salinities are confirmed to be expected at the volturno river mouth and the actual seawater wedge width does not propagate inland for more than 0 5 km as average estimation across mc scenarios this result is consistent with different sources of information previous literature works a local calibrated numerical model and the use of empirical formulas these results are consistent with paleo salinization patterns retrieved from geological and sedimentary assessment of the areas where lacustrine sediments were deposited with the withdrawal of the ancient lagoon furthermore the recognition of different depositional environments enables to differentiate different magnitude of salinization the highest values occur in lacustrine like sediments with numerous clayey peaty lenses the convenience and good reliability of the present approach to estimate the spatial salinization patterns in coastal aquifers is promising for future research perspective

14895,the issue of freshwater salinization in coastal areas has grown in importance with the increase of the demand of groundwater supply and the more frequent droughts however the spatial patterns of salinity contamination are not easy to be understood as well as their numerical modeling is subject to various kinds of uncertainty this paper offers a robust flexible and reliable geostatistical methodology to provide a stochastic assessment of salinity distribution in alluvial coastal areas the methodology is applied to a coastal aquifer in campania italy where 83 monitoring wells provided depth averaged salinity data a monte carlo mc framework was implemented to simulate depth averaged groundwater salinity fields both mc stochastic fields and the mean across mc simulations enabled to the delineation of which areas are subject to high salinity then a probabilistic approach was developed setting up salinity thresholds for agricultural use to delineate the areas with unsuitable groundwater for irrigation purposes furthermore steady spatial patterns of saline wedge lengths were unveiled through uncertainty estimates of seawater ingression at the volturno river mouth the results were compared versus a calibrated numerical model with remarkable model fit r2 0 96 and versus an analytical solution obtaining similar wedge lengths the results pointed out that the high groundwater salinities found inland more than 2 km from the coastline could be ascribed to trapped paleo seawater rather than to actual seawater intrusion in fact the inland high salinities were in correspondence of thick peaty layers which can store trapped saline waters because of their high porosity and low permeability furthermore these results are consistent with the recognition of depositional environments and the position of ancient lagoon alluvial sediments located in the same areas where are the highest simulated salinity fields this robust probabilistic approach could be applied to similar alluvial coastal areas to understand spatial patterns of present salinization to disentangle actual from paleo seawater intrusion and more in general to delineate zones with unsuitable salinity for irrigation purposes keywords salinization aquifers geostatistics trapped seawater saline wedge data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction groundwater salinization in coastal aquifers is a long term issue in hydrogeology custodio 1988 bear et al 1999 barlow 2003 but with the increasing water demand due to population growth and the accelerating climatic change that triggered prolonged water crises scattered around the world the attention on coastal groundwater resources recently peaked these factors have boosted the research of this topic using different approaches combining the classical hydrogeological and hydrochemical characterization tools with stable isotopes kim et al 2007 de montety et al 2008 cary et al 2015 caschetto et al 2017 or adding geophysical methods de franco et al 2009 rasmussen et al 2013 trabelsi et al 2013 carol et al 2021a or coupling the investigation with density dependent flow and transport numerical models comte and banton 2007 koukadaki et al 2007 meyer et al 2019 those methods often provide insight into salinization processes e g distinguishing among actual and paleo seawater intrusion delsman et al 2014 zhao et al 2017 bauer et al 2022 but they suffer from high quality datasets need like high resolution multi level samplers isotopes analyses or expensive geophysical equipment rarely available except in small and highly characterized areas to overcome these common issues several empirical indices have been formulated in gis environment to assess the vulnerability of coastal aquifers to salinization tomaszkiewicz et al 2014 trabelsi et al 2016 motevalli et al 2019 kazakis et al 2019 even with spatial prediction including climate changes klassen and allen 2017 busico et al 2021 nevertheless interpolation among poorly characterized variables like hydraulic conductivity or chloride concentrations may produce large uncertainties in the vulnerability maps thus many of the above mentioned authors suggest taking particular care during the geostatistical analysis of input variables to estimate salinity concentrations across a given study area in fact determining high salinity areas via geostatistical methods is usually simpler than using numerical models to achieve the same result whereas the former is much simpler the latter needs proper boundary conditions set up and calibration which may not be a simple task but often provide the most robust and reliable methods to estimate and quantify the groundwater salinity distribution mastrocicco and colombani 2021 the employment of artificial intelligence algorithms in recent years have added a novel approach which use the groundwater quality data alagha et al 2017 taşan et al 2022 often referred to as surrogate modeling tools artificial intelligence algorithms have shown acceptable performance in simulating complex hydrogeological processes and when scarce data do not allow to build up numerical models trichakis et al 2011 nevertheless artificial intelligence algorithms suffer the problem of large uncertainties in the produced maps if the training dataset is not well distributed in space and time to date stochastic modelling has been applied to many hydrogeological contexts fiori et al 2015 banusch et al 2022 schiavo et al 2022 but still encounters large resistance to become a standardized practice sanchez vila and fernàndez garcia 2016 most of the studies on coastal groundwater salinization approach this issue from the modeling side while few works frame a geostatistical approach as recently reviewed by panagiotou et al 2022 and those treating the problem from the stochastic viewpoint are still a minority pool et al 2015 for example abu al naeem et al 2018 employed a combined geostatistical and hydrogeochemical methodology to assess the extension and origins of highly salinized areas in palestine although without using a stochastic framework finally a recent work of jamei et al 2022 has analyzed the salinization of groundwater resources in a multi aquifer system in bangladesh via hybrid artificial intelligence algorithms complemented with a monte carlo approach but only to avoid parameters overfitting the present work aims to exploit further points that previous geostatistical oriented works on aquifer salinization did not highlight here the aim is not only to assess salinization patterns in areas where human and agricultural uses of freshwater resources are relevant but also to produce simulated salinity fields to approach the problem from a stochastic point of view in particular the present work is centered on stochastic modelling of salinity simulated fields upon a sequential methodology employing sparce groundwater salinity data to assess the probability that a certain area is contaminated by an over threshold of salinity and to uncertainly evaluate if this area is connected or not with neighboring ones this analysis may inform water managers about the spatial source and probable connections of salinity concentrations and to quantitatively estimate the probability of an area of being affected by a certain salinity threshold in order to fully understand and frame different processes that might be involved in salinization issues the volturno river mouth area italy has been selected to test whether stochastic modeling fulfills the aim of i reproducing the saline ingression alongside major rivers or in the proximity of lakes e g lake patria ii evaluating the saline wedge intrusion uncertainties at different locations respect to a numerical model and an analytical solution and iii appraising the probable extension of highly salinized areas while seeking for the hydrogeological consistency with geological models and available stratigraphic data the major novelty of this study is that the proposed stochastic interpolation approach has a fast computing time a simple setup with respect to any density dependent numerical model and needs fewer data than the latter and the results may come up consistent with the widest variety of information sources from paleo geological to geological or to numerical ones besides the present work aims to propose a simplified but robust framework to be employed in other alluvial coastal areas in the world affected by both actual and paleo seawater intrusion problems 2 methodology 2 1 available data and study area the coastal unconfined aquifer to test this methodology is the terminal part of the floodplain belonging to the volturno river mouth which is located within the campania plain southern italy fig 1 the entire campania plain has notable economic and ecological values due to the presence of many farm activities touristic structures and wetland protected zones such as the variconi oasis the volturno river coastal plain is located within a large extensional sedimentary basin that developed during the quaternary and is still actively subsiding its margins are set among the western arc of the southern apennines and the eastern tyrrhenian margin matano et al 2014 the actual geomorphological features are a combination of the late holocene sedimentary evolution and anthropic interventions like urban settlements expansion land reclamation works and intensive agriculture busico et al 2021 the selected study area has a rectangular shape with the major axis oriented along the shoreline is bordered at north by the agnena river and at south by the regi lagni reclamation canal and its mean ground elevation ranges from 2 0 to 4 0 m above sea level a s l at the center of the area lies the terminal part of the volturno river while semipermanent water bodies lagoons and wetlands like the patria lake sacchi et al 2014 are scattered along the coast the unconfined coastal aquifer is hosted in actual and paleo dune sandy deposits crossed by several fluvial paleochannels that are interlayered with silty and peaty lenses amorosi et al 2012 a pro delta unit formed by silty clay sediments is present from 16 to 21 m a s l it represents the local aquiclude of the unconfined coastal aquifer zanchetta et al 2004 fig 1 the study area corresponds to the area of maximum seawater expansion inland during the last holocenic deglaciation dated back to 6 5 ky before present sacchi et al 2014 surface waters and groundwater samples were collected in a sampling campaign in september 2019 on 60 monitoring stations fig 1 and analyzed in the field for salinity measurements using a portable multiparameter probe hi 9828 hanna instruments the domain of the numerical model previously developed by mastrocicco et al 2019 and here employed to compare the present work s results is highlighted by a yellow box panel a 2 2 groundwater setting salinization patterns and the link with agricultural practices groundwater flowlines orthogonally flow from inland areas toward the coastline mostly following the path of major rivers and with prevailing pattern of submarine groundwater discharge over seawater intrusion along the whole campania region gaiolini et al 2022 this consideration highlights the importance of understanding salinization patterns along surface water bodies to assess i their possible role in vehiculating seawater intrusion or conversely ii to highlight areas with hazardous salinity which are connected through the aquifer body with the surface network the area near to the volturno river is characterized by slightly saline groundwater inland and in proximity to the coast and by reducing conditions due to presence of peaty lenses corniello and ducci 2014 groundwater is characterized by sodium absorption ratio and ec values from medium to extremely high making most of the coastal groundwater unsuitable for irrigation mastrocicco et al 2021 the vulnerability to the actual seawater intrusion extent has been recently estimated via a weighting and rating method busico et al 2021 here the highest vulnerability was clearly found along the entire coastline but very high vulnerability zones were also found along the terminal branches of volturno and agnena rivers up to 4 0 km from the river mouth in fact their riverbeds are located below the tyrrenian sea level possibly promoting seawater encroachment 2 3 paleolagoon and depositional environments recently ruberti et al 2022 have unravelled the paleo reconstruction of the volturno river coastal plain during the quaternary they found that the volturno coastal plain evolution was driven by sediment supply and global eustatic variations during the holocene briefly the mediterranean sea level rise created a paleo gulf extending up to 10 km inland between 6 5 4 5 ka bp then a late stage progradation 4 5 ka bp was accompanied by the development of a paleo coastal lagoon system that persisted up to the roman age aiello et al 2018 the associated beach dune system and coastal lagoons have been relatively stable since the roman time until early 1800 when a large land reclamation was established and the former roman clanio river was channelized and renamed regi lagni along with more than 500 km of channels and ditches amorosi et al 2012 sacchi et al 2014 the continental depositional facies comprise the volturno fluvial system characterized by medium coarse sand and gravel paleochannels passing to silty sand and grey blue clay floodplain deposits and peat ruberti et al 2022 while the bayhead deltaic depositional facies comprise a transgressive barrier with medium and fine sands interfingered with clay and thick back barrier peaty sediments characterized by high subsidence rates due to presence of peaty lenses and silty clay deposits especially in the area between the agnena and volturno rivers busico et al 2021 located in the north eastern sector of the study area fig 1 2 4 stochastic modeling of salinity fields the investigation domain was discretized in squared cells of 0 1 km for a total amount of approximately 3 10 5 cells each i th cell barycenter is identified by its geographical coordinates x i x i y i depth average salinity values were identified by each borehole coordinate x n x n y n a variogram analysis goovaerts 1997 chiles and delfiner 2009 was performed to study the spatial correlation of depth averaged measured salinity values throughout the domain this analysis served to model salinity spatial correlation and to simulate a different random value for each i th domain site see section 3 1 as a first step the existence of 2d anisotropies was studied by employing directional variograms on the available dataset since no preferential directions emerged for data spatial correlation an omnidirectional variogram model was employed to interpret the spatial distribution of this dataset once this step was achieved a proper variogram model was calibrated using a best fitting gaussian function deutsch and journel 1997 to be used for the simulation of stochastic fields of the variable of interest stochastic conditional depth averaged salinity fields rely upon the dataset described in section 2 1 an isotropic omnidirectional variogram function isaaks and srivastava 1989 was chosen to interpret the dataset spatial correlation 1 γ h σ n 2 exp 1 3 h 2 a 2 where h x x is the separation distance between vector locations x and x for each n th borehole of the dataset σ n 2 and a are model parameters corresponding to the variogram sill and range respectively the former was estimated as the variance of the n available data while the latter was estimated via a maximum likelihood ml approach with best estimated range of 2 5 km and a 95 confidence interval between lower and upper bounds of 0 3 km then a very well know and widely applied geostatistical methodology sequential gaussian simulations sgsim deutsch and journel 1997 remy and boucher 2009 was employed to achieve sequential continuous fields of depth averaged salinity concentration this enabled to move from the discrete characterization of local salinity that the dataset provided to the continuous stochastic representation of the same variable stochastic values are therefore associated with each cell barycenter embedded by as many as the simulations were performed then the results were collected within a monte carlo mc framework to be treated as a simulations ensemble three uses of mc salinization fields were performed i considering them one by one as random fields with locally varying spatial patterns ii thresholding each random field upon one or more salinity values hence embedding each salinity value as a logical variable 0 or 1 if the prescribed threshold was met or not and iii considering the local mean across simulations ensemble to have the most probable one since the mean coincides with the most probable value if the spatial distribution of the latter is gaussian this moved the analysis toward the domain of probabilities this can be explained by introducing an indicator variable as follows 2 i r x i 1 i f c r x i t h r 0 i f c r x i t h r w i t h r 1 r r 1 r being each mc simulation c r x i the local simulated salinity concentration value at the i th cell of the r th realization and i r x i is the value of i x i in realization r of the ensemble then χ x i was computed as 3 χ x i 1 r r 1 r i r x i q r q an integer between 1 and r being the number of mc simulations where the indicator is equal to one at the i th location therefore the indicator i x i is a random variable that follows a bernoulli distribution with probability χ x i given by pr i x i 1 χ x i such a probabilistic approach schiavo 2022a enables to stochastically assess local probabilities of saline concentrations and look for areas most likely to be contaminated a geological section named section aa in fig 1 already introduced by ruberti et al 2022 was employed to appraise the hydrogeological consistency between the mc salinity fields and the conceptualization of the hydrogeological setting of the area this analysis was extended to additional transects along major rivers volturno river and the regi lagni canal and the coastline profile to understand what the probability of a certain salinity does look like analytical solutions for the depth averaged estimation of the width of the saline wedge inland were employed as reported in beebe et al 2016 and references therein these results were used to verify the consistency of the stochastic saline wedge width along the whole coastline with a particular interest in the volturno river mouth fig 1 here the mc results were compared with those inferred by a variable density numerical groundwater flow and transport model previously published by mastrocicco et al 2019 and performed near the volturno river mouth within a small portion of the actual study domain briefly the seawat model set up consisted of a squared area of 1 5 km2 yellow square in fig 1a discretized in a regular spaced grid of 10 10 m and 12 layers of different thicknesses enclosing the local ground surface and the top of the prodelta silty clay unit different flow and transport packages were used to fully define the system the time variant specified head boundary package was used to represent the regional freshwater flow boundary and the tyrrhenian sea boundary the river package was employed to simulate the volturno river the recharge and the evapotranspiration packages were also used the seawat model was calibrated versus measured pressure heads and salinities the squared correlation coefficient r2 taylor 1997 and the nash sutcliffe efficiency index nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 are employed to assess the correlation between the model and present results 3 results 3 1 salinity fields monte carlo realizations stochastic conditional salinity fields rely upon the dataset described in section 2 1 and the variogram modeling described in section 2 2 a collection of mc realizations of salinity fields was generated as previously described in section 2 2 a series of 2500 simulations run was necessary to reach the numerical stability of first statistical moments for the simulated salinity at each cell across progressive mc realizations details not shown in fig 2 exemplary stochastic mc salinity fields are illustrated 3 2 salinity agricultural related thresholds to assess hazardous areas two different salinity thresholds 1 5 and 2 5 g l have been applied to each mc realization since most agricultural crops show yield reduction at 1 5 g l and become substantially affected over 2 5 g l katerji et al 2003 each salinity field realization enables to delineate the areas where the employed threshold is exceeded or not the higher the threshold the narrower the areas where the threshold is exceeded hence spatial patterns of salinization fields must be investigated if different areas with salinity higher than the prescribed threshold are connected or not fig 3 illustrates the application of the two thresholds to the mc salinity realizations depicted in fig 1 the areas with a mc simulated salinity higher than 1 5 g l are depicted in light red while those where the concentration is higher than 2 5 g l are depicted in red the areas where salinity concentrations are higher than employed thresholds spread through the outback being limited to a few clusters of modest width along the coastline zone some connections can be assessed if the lower of the two thresholds is employed being interrupted if the higher threshold is used this suggests that the inland s high salinity concentrations are clustered in some areas with poor mutual connections between each other and the sea as the main salinity source even such a rough connectivity appraisal may lead to the hypothesis that the tyrrenian sea is the major salinity source in the coastline zone while the inland s source is likely to be different from the actual seawater intrusion ensembling all the mc salinity fields the most probable salinity concentration field can be achieved when the mean across each mc realizations is performed at each domain cell the resulting average salinity field is reported in fig 4 panel a in panels b and c of fig 4 the probability fields retrieved by employing salinity thresholds of 1 5 and 2 5 g l are illustrated as discussed for fig 3 the higher the threshold the narrower are the areas embedded by high χ x i as probability values of exceedance the imposed threshold 3 3 large scale geological consistency of salinity and probability fields a large scale appraisal of the geological consistency of the stochastic approach here proposed can be assessed through the juxtaposition of an available geological map matano et al 2018 of the area with the mean concentration field fig 4 panel a and that depicting the probability of having a local concentration higher or equal than 1 5 g l fig 4 panel b as illustrated by fig 5 in panel a panel b in fig 5 enables to appraise which sediment type hosts the highest average saline concentration within the study area dashed green and magenta lines highlight concentration thresholds of 1 5 and 2 5 g l see panels b and c in fig 4 respectively the highest concentration can be assessed where lacustrine peaty and clayey deposits depicted in light gray blue are prevalent while aeolian ones located along the coastline have the lowest concentration the second sediment facies with the highest salinity concentration are alluvial sediments depicted in blue which are a mix of silt sand and clay lenses panel c in fig 5 enables to correlate the sediment type with the probability of having a saline concentration higher than 1 5 g l the highest probability can be assessed where lacustrine peaty and clayey deposits are prevalent depicted in light gray blue while sandy permeable aeolian ones depicted in light orange located along the coastline have the lowest probability of being contaminated by saline concentrations larger than 1 5 g l the second sediment facies with the highest probability of being contaminated by concentrations larger than 1 5 g l are alluvial sediments depicted in blue which are a mix of silt sand and clay lenses 3 4 hydrogeological consistency of salinity fields a more detailed assessment of the salinization in particular areas of the domain can be done if both the concentration and the probability of exceeding a threshold are investigated therefore 4 transects are delineated see fig 1 to be inspected i one along the volturno river thalweg ii one along the regi lagni canal thalweg iii one along the coastline with the aim of understanding the seawater wedge penetrating inland and iv one along a geological section to inspect for the geological consistency of the salinization spatial fields here proposed both panels in fig 6 are dedicated to this task fig 6 panels illustrate the average salinity concentration field from a to d and the probability χ x i from e to h of having a local value higher than 1 5 g l along the volturno river panels a and e the regi lagni canal panels b and f the coastline panels c and g and the geological section aa panels d and h respectively the salinity probability profiles fig 6 indicate elevated salinities in the proximity of the coastline as one can expect due to actual seawater intrusion after being mostly neglected moving inland both the salinity and the probability profiles highlight an abrupt increase at more than 5 km from the coastline this evidence strengthens the thesis that the high inland salinity concentration does not depend on the salinity of the sea or on the effect of the saline wedge inland penetration but rather depends on relict paleo seawater trapped within highly porous clayey soil layers this behavior can be appraised also from panels b and f where the highest salinity and probability values in the proximity of the sea and 6 7 km inland respectively seem to be poorly connected by low counterparts located from 2 to 5 km form the coastline as well as the probability of high salinity values from 2 to 5 km inland are very low as one can appraise by comparing the latter panels with panels b and c in fig 4 furthermore panels c and g in fig 6 reveal that salinity and probability peaks along the coastline are in proximity of major surface water bodies the three salinity peaks detected from panel c in fig 6 can be associated to the volturno river regi lagni canal and lake patria in the southern part of the domain see fig 1 respectively the latter water body is well connected to the tyrrhenian sea through a cemented channel and is characterized by high salinity this local salinization pattern is however poorly correlated with the surrounding salinity values see also fig 4 s panels suggesting a localized salinity pattern that may not affect the surrounding inland aquifer due to the poor connection of the patria lakebed consisting of silty clay sediments with the coastal aquifer sacchi et al 2014 panels d and h in fig 6 suggest that the highest salinity values as well as the highest probabilities of having over threshold concentrations are in areas where thick organic clayey layers are identified busico et al 2021 ruberti et al 2022 strengthening the idea that inland salinity may be likely to depend on trapped paleo seawater rather than actual seawater intrusion 3 5 ancient quaternary lagoon consistency of simulated salinization patterns the highest values of simulated salinity achieved from the mean across mc realization of local salinity are concentrated where the back barrier peaty depositional facies are located which is consistent with the palaeogeographical evolution of the area depicted in fig 7 the nature of these depositional facies rules local circulation patterns within the subsurface as well as water flow energy dissipation hence being useful to inform about salinization processes other footholds to the proposed thesis can be retrieved if water table measurements sourced from gaiolini et al 2022 are compared with salinization values and divided for different depositional environments the latter environments are illustrated in fig 8 and referring to areas depicted in fig 6 lacustrine aeolian pyroclastic and alluvial sediment areas in panels a b c and d respectively the highest values of water table are measured within lacustrine or alluvial depositional environments the lowest where pyroclastic and aeolian sediments are located aeolian sediments are well acknowledged see e g ruberti et al 2022 for being in connection with the coastline as indicated by lower water table levels than their lacustrine counterparts on the contrary the lacustrine environment is characterized by water table levels higher than the sea level of 2 3 m on average hence being disconnected from the sea therefore the latter one is the most likely to trap paleo seawater being geologically see section 3 3 and hydrogeologically see section 3 4 disconnected by the present seawater intrusion 3 6 assessing the role of the present seawater from a stochastic point of view at this point it is interesting to quantify the inland penetration of the tyrrenian sea to understand its role in the salinization of coastal aquifers it is pivotal to assess if the connection with high salinity values far from the coastline may be associated within a probabilistic framework to those in the proximity of the tyrrhenian sea this can be done within the present stochastic approach by taking each of the mc realizations and plotting the width of the saline wedge along the tyrrhenian sea coastline the results are illustrated in fig 9 in panel a each of the r th realizations corresponds to a blue line while the mean across these is the red line the latter informs that the maximum inland saline penetration from the sea occurs at the mouth of the volturno river with a mean value of 520 m this result is confirmed by the application of analytical solutions fig 9 panel b commonly used for the evaluation of the maximum width of the saline wedge in coastal aquifers werner et al 2013 beebe et al 2016 upon hydrogeological data on the aquifer under investigation mastrocicco et al 2021 the reliability of the present approach can be sustained by comparison with the latest available numerical model calibrated for a portion of the domain the mean across the mc salinization fields is correlated with that inferred from a seawat langevin et al 2007 numerical simulation calibrated by mastrocicco et al 2019 in an area located at the volturno river mouth the comparison performed between the numerical calibrated model and the present work s results are reported in fig 10 panel a as well as their correlation appraised via r2 and nse index coefficient see section 2 while statistics regarding the similarity of statistical moments are reported in panel b the mean across the mc salinity fields slightly overestimated local salinity values in particular medium ones returning an overall very good outcome 0 96 an nse of 0 74 reveals a good consistency between the two models spatial salinity fields the ratios of the first statistical moments with σ as the standard deviation s as the skewness and k as kurtosis evaluated between the model mod subscript and the average salinity field mc subscript are fair enough to give credit to the results here presented the latter ratios are enough to regard the two populations of local salinity values i e the modeled and the mean across the mc ones as statistically mutually consistent the uncertainty related to the approach here employed as well as the one related to data uncertainty and kriging parameters see e g athens and caers 2022 schiavo 2022b should be investigated for a deeper assessment 3 7 geostatistical variograms all the proposed results have stemmed from a geostatistical methodology hence they need to be recovered to the initial viewpoint for a complete process understanding fig 11 depicts experimental variograms retrieved for salinity values see fig 4 and panels therein measured at wells locations for 30 in orange and 120 in green degrees principal directions along those the domain has been oriented each directional variogram shows experimental points within the normal score space goovaerts 1997 with a red dashed line highlighting the experimental variance hence equal to 1 and a shadowed box highlighting the experimental data range of variation i e the range of possible distances needed to reach a lack of spatial correlation between randomly taken points although the present results fully rely upon the usage of an omnidirectional variogram which is needed to retrieve the spatial variation of the variable of interest for the whole domain without preferential directionalities schiavo 2022a for an application with the same issue the inspection of directional variograms may be of interest to understand how salinity varies along principal axes as fig 11 illustrates the range of lags for reaching the sill along a 30 deg direction is double about 7 km that along the 120 deg one about 3 5 km while the former rules the variation of salinity fields hence of the mean across the mc realizations as illustrated in fig 4 panel a with the domain s width the latter reproduces that along the coastline or parallel directions this means that salinity fields varying across the domain s width are far more correlated than those along the coastline where high values of salinity are present in some hotspots such as river mouths but highly mutually disconnected see the sparsity of reddish areas along the coastline in fig 4 panel a moreover the variability of experimental points variances horizontal blue arrows for the 120 deg direction green dots on the sill vertical black arrows abruptly changes within narrow distances twice of the experimental variance as one may appraise from short lagged experimental points conversely most of the points within the range of variation of the sill for the 30 deg directional variogram orange dots are characterized by lower changes in experimental variances about a half of the experimental variance especially for distances between points higher than 2 3 km large or narrow changes in experimental variance for experimental variogram points along a certain direction implies an even larger or narrower non linear variation in local simulated salinity since local values would disclose to the mean salinity i e embedded with a standard deviation with the square root of the variance short lagged points are embedded by experimental variances significantly more varying with the lag than those located at distances higher than 2 3 km and far less correlated than those these geostatistical consistency sources are consistent with discontinuous patterns of salinity from the coastline with inland areas inferred in section 3 1 4 discussion this work presents a stochastic approach to model saline occurrence in coastal alluvial aquifers the aim of the present work is to frame a complex hydrogeological problem to offer a stochastic approach a robust geostatistical methodology and a real case study application strengthened by several proofs about the consistency of the employed approach coming from different sources geological hydrogeological salinization processes based this methodology starts from observed depth averaged salinity concentrations collected within the volturno river floodplain area grounding on a well acknowledged geostatistical simulation method the present approach enables to retrieve monte carlo simulations of salinization concentrations in each location of a regularly gridded domain which is preliminarily considered as bi dimensional the numerical results are offered as i stochastic salinity fields ii mean concentration fields obtained as the average across the mc ensemble and iii maps with the local probability that the average simulated salinity exceeds a threshold value the importance of uncertain spatial evaluation of salinization areas is fundamental to assess where groundwater resources are suitable for human or agricultural uses bierkens and wada 2019 the results shown in sections 3 1 and 3 2 highlight that the highest salinization values are located i along the coastline suggesting actual seawater intrusion or ii far inland as isolated clusters embedded by very low probability of being connected with the present coastline the latter salinized areas are the source of most of the concerns because of the high density of human and agricultural related activities in the area the gathered information suggests that these salination clusters depend on paleo trapped seawater this thesis is supported by multiple footholds which can be divided in different groups section 3 3 deepens how high inland salinization values are mostly located where lacustrine and alluvial sediments geologically disconnected by the coastline are located section 3 4 show the hydrogeological setting of inland salinized areas which are likely of being disconnected from the coastline along major river body tracks coastline and geological sections of interest suggesting a negligible probability of the interaction of present seawater inland these analyses are also supported by the fact that apart from those located along the coastline the highest salinized wells are located where the aquifer thickness is enough at least 25 30 m within lacustrine or alluvial sedimentary geological zones to include peaty clayey lenses which are highly likely of being able to trap paleo seawater as reported and discussed in section 3 5 moreover the hydraulics of these areas confirm these suggestions since the highest salinized wells are located where low and spatially constant water table levels are measured and local hydraulic gradients are very low in these areas the local water table levels are however higher than the sea level hence being clearly hydraulically disconnected from the seawater furthermore salinization patterns appear to be intimately related to different kinds of depositional environments as reported in sections 3 3 and 3 5 in addition a paleo geological analysis suggest that the ancient lagoon environment is trapping paleo seawater responsible for the present inland hazardous salinization as proposed by previous paleo geological literature works see section 3 6 moreover a supplementary geostatistical analysis section 3 8 supports this by detecting precise spatial patterns through variograms directionality analysis of inland salinization the same salinization patterns also occur in other areas in the mediterranean area mastrocicco and colombani 2021 and worldwide wang and jiao 2012 carol et al 2021b where groundwater and seawater interface positions are a result of late quaternary paleoenvironmental conditions with evaporites dissolution in back barrier environments which creates brines even at shallow depths delsman et al 2014 liu et al 2017 caschetto et al 2017 finally in section 3 7 the inland penetration length of the present seawater wedge is estimated of being lower than 0 5 km along the entire coastline with an expected maximum at the mouth of the major river of the area volturno river these analyses performed with a stochastic approach are consistent with analytical solutions which are more commonly used for these purposes and with the latest available numerical models calibrated for the investigated area supporting the present thesis 5 conclusions a stochastic framework has been proposed to investigate coastal aquifers salinization and assess most vulnerable areas the core of this study is the sequential simulation of salinity fields the results achieved from simulations ensemble treated from a probabilistic perspective are consistent with previous datasets a wide variety of consistency sources and available simulations key points of the present work can be summarized as follows i highest salinities are located at the mouth of the main rivers or far inland the latter as isolated clusters the probabilistic analysis suggests a different origin for these two salinization phenomena since no probable spatial connection exists between the former and the latter ii the study of over threshold salinities allowed to appraise which areas are more likely of being affected becoming unsuitable for human freshwater supply or agriculture use iii inland high salinity concentrations are located where relevant peaty layers are framed within the subsurface water bodies this strengthened the hypothesis that the inland salinities arise from trapped paleo seawater rather than from actual seawater intrusion iv the stochastic approach enabled to have a reliable appraisal of the inland penetration of the saline wedge along the whole coastline the highest salinities are confirmed to be expected at the volturno river mouth and the actual seawater wedge width does not propagate inland for more than 0 5 km as average estimation across mc scenarios this result is consistent with different sources of information previous literature works a local calibrated numerical model and the use of empirical formulas these results are consistent with paleo salinization patterns retrieved from geological and sedimentary assessment of the areas where lacustrine sediments were deposited with the withdrawal of the ancient lagoon furthermore the recognition of different depositional environments enables to differentiate different magnitude of salinization the highest values occur in lacustrine like sediments with numerous clayey peaty lenses the convenience and good reliability of the present approach to estimate the spatial salinization patterns in coastal aquifers is promising for future research perspective for example a 3d geostatistical model applied to a sub portion of the domain used in this work s application would reveal other insights about salinization in this area fundings this research received

14896,wastewater treatment plants wwtps are important sinks of microplastics mps and antibiotics resistance genes args information regarding connections between functional modules of wwtps and spread of args under mps stress is still lacking in this study correlations between p n and c related functional genes and args in a sequencing batch reactor sbr system were evaluated under polystyrene ps mps stress total p and chemical oxygen demand cod in effluent showed no significant changes under 0 5 50 mg l 1 ps mps stress within 32 cycle treatment periods of sbr while 0 5 mg l 1 ps mps affected the n cycling process ps mps 0 5 50 mg l 1 promoted the richness and diversity of microbial community in sbr and the denitrification process was exuberant ps mps with a low dosage 0 5 5 mg l 1 enhanced secretion of extracellular polymeric substances and promoted expression levels of functional genes related to c fixation c degradation p cycling and n cycling simultaneously aac 3 ii blatem 1 and tetw increased by 27 13 38 36 and 9 57 under low dosages of ps mps stress more importantly the total absolute abundance of inti1 nearly doubled 78 4 of these p n and c related functional genes were positively correlated with inti1 thus favoring transmission of args this study firstly disclosed the underlying correlations between functional modules of wwtps and spread of args under mps stress graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords antibiotics resistance genes functional genes microplastics wastewater treatment plants arg transmission data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction according to the us national oceanic and atmospheric administration plastics with particle size lower than 5 mm are considered as microplastics mps xu et al 2019 mps have been the global environmental problem due to the wide application of plastics around the world derraik 2002 jambeck et al 2015 lebreton et al 2017 mps can be easily found in different aquatic systems including marine freshwater and wastewater treatment plants wwtps estahbanati and fahrenfeld 2016 murphy et al 2016 up to now more than 45 types of mps have been detected in the wwtps mostly including polystyrene polyvinyl chloride polyamide polyethylene terephthalate polypropylene and polyethylene ali et al 2021 the use of facial scrubs is predicted to release 209 7 trillion microbeads to water environment in china each year and the wwtps account for more than 80 of the effluent mps cheung and fok 2017 generally wwtps are effective in removing mps from sewage murphy et al 2016 and lares et al 2018 found that removal efficiency of mps reached up to 98 during the sewage treatment process however most of the removed mps remain in the sludge li et al 2018b ziajahromi et al 2016 considering the micro size strong hydrophobicity potential additives and ability to absorb pollutants mps would impact microorganisms in the sludge affecting the performance of treatment process wang and wang 2018 zhao et al 2020 previous studies demonstrated that mps could deteriorate the dewaterability of excess sludge and inhibited the nitrification process li et al 2020a xu et al 2021 additionally the accumulation of mps provided new microbial niches and stimulated the interactions of microorganisms yang et al 2022 most researches are focused on the effects of mps on nitrification and denitrification processes little has been performed to reveal the impacts of mps on the entire functional modules such as c fixation c degradation p cycling and n cycling of the wwtps antibiotics are frequently detected in the effluent of the wwtps due to the stimulation of antibiotics wwtps are the source of antibiotics resistance genes args sun et al 2016 wang et al 2020a being the typical by products of wastewater treatment process activated sludge is the enormous storage of args and mobile genetic elements mges which facilitates the propagate of args xu et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 in general land application is used as the final disposal of sludge sharma et al 2017 wang et al 2022 while the args remained in the sludge probably pose potential risks for both environment and human health forsberg et al 2012 oberbeckmann et al 2017 and zhang et al 2020 observed the accumulation of antibiotic resistance bacteria on the surface of mps which might contribute to the horizontal transfer of args thus the influences of mps on args in the wwtps should be considered recent studies found that mps selectively promoted the enrichment of args such as sul1 fabi and erme and mges inti1 in the wwtps dai et al 2020 wang et al 2020b zhou et al 2022a nevertheless little is known about the connections between the functional modules c fixation c degradation p cycling and n cycling and spread of args in the wwtps under mps stress in this study the impacts of mps on functional modules and args in a sequencing batch reactor sbr system were investigated polystyrene ps is widely used in packaging and containers being one of the most frequently detected mps in the influent and effluent of wwtps ali et al 2021 franco et al 2021 sol et al 2020 hence ps was selected as one of the typical mps firstly the performance of effluent in the lab scale sbr system with ps mps addition was evaluated secondly the influences of ps mps on microbial community and p n and c related functional genes were explored subsequently the impacts of ps mps on the spread of args were evaluated finally connections between these functional genes and args under ps mps exposure were established 2 materials and methods 2 1 sludge samples and mps ps mps powder mainly 80 160 um was provided by dongguan jing tian raw materials of plastics co ltd china and was filtered using a 100 200 mesh sieve the scanning electron microscopy sem and particle diameter of the ps mps were listed in figure s1 and figure s2 respectively the morphology of the mps was spherical with d50 of 77 6 μm which was consistent with previous reports that approximately 80 of mps were less than 100 μm in wwtps jiang et al 2020 yang et al 2021 activated sludge was sampled in the sludge return unit of a wwtp anaerobic anoxic oxic process treatment capacity 40 000 m3 d 1 in yangling shaanxi china the background concentration of mps in the sludge was approximately 0 03 mg l 1 yang et al 2021 the presence of antibiotics in the effluent of the wwtp was listed in table s1 the concentration of tetracycline reached up to 18 672 ng l 1 was the most abundant beta lactam antibiotics were seldom detected owing to the hydrolysis after the sludge was sampled from the wwtp it was aerated in a 15 l sbr system for 24 h to remove organic matters before the acclimation the sbr system was kept running until the effluent was stable nh4 n 0 5 mg l 1 cod 50 mg l 1 2 2 sbr system establishment four 3 l sbr systems 14 cm internal diameter and 20 cm height were set up to simulate the sewage treatment process under mps exposure each cycle of sbr consisted of feeding 20 min anaerobic stage 40 min aerobic stage 480 min settling 90 min decanting 20 min and idle 70 min the aeration rate was maintained at 60 l h 1 at the feeding stage one liter of synthetic wastewater details are introduced in text s1 in the supporting information was added to each sbr system ma et al 2016 mps concentration in influent in a typical wwtp varied from 1 to 10 044 particles l 1 approximately 55 mg l 1 jiang et al 2020 sun et al 2019 therefore the concentrations of ps mps were set as 0 5 5 and 50 mg l 1 and they were separately added into three sbr systems marked as r1 r2 and r3 respectively the rest one was set as control r0 no ps addition a certain amount of waste activated sludge was added to the sbr system and the concentration of sludge in the sbr was approximately 8000 mg l 1 and the ph was 7 5 8 effluent was collected every 2 cycles and the concentration of nitrogen phosphorus and cod removal efficiency were measured after different cycles sludge samples containing mps were collected at the idle stage and were stored at 80 c before microbial community and genes analysis in this process the mps were not separated from the sludge samples to avoid the interference of chemical reagents on microbial community during mps extraction 2 3 physicochemical property analysis of sludge samples extracellular polymeric substances eps commonly consisted of tightly bound eps tb eps loosely bound eps lb eps and soluble eps s eps zhang et al 2016 the analyses of the eps are shown in text s2 dissolved organic carbon doc of different kinds of eps was measured by a total organic carbon analyzer toc multin cuv analytic jena germany eps were calculated as doc mixed liquor suspended solids mlss proteins were measured by the lowry folin method polysaccharides were quantified following the phenol sulfuric acid method cod nitrogen and phosphorus were measured using standard methods as previously reported rice et al 2012 all experiments were conducted in triplicate 2 4 microbial community analysis the microbial community of sludge samples were explored by illumina miseq sequencer in sangon biotech co ltd shanghai china the e z n a mag bind soil dna kit was used to extract dna from 0 5 g fresh sludge samples following the manufacture s instruction the extracted dna was measured by agarose gel electrophoresis for integrity and by qubit fluorometric quantification for purity the sequence reads were clustered into operational taxonomic units otus at a similarity threshold of 97 on the i sanger platform the detailed processes are illustrated in text s3 2 5 quantification of args and functional genes according to the results of metagenomic high throughput sequencing multidrug tetracycline beta lactam and aminoglycoside resistance genes were the top 4 types of args figure s3 the multidrug type of args is affected by multiple antibiotics therefore the following three types of args tetracycline tetc tetw beta lactam blatem 1 and aminoglycoside aac 3 ii were chosen as the targets in this study also the class i integron inti1 plays an important role in gene transfer among bacteria it is frequently reported to carry one or more gene cassettes that encode antibiotic resistance ma et al 2011 thus inti1 was also chosen to provide insight into args dissemination potentials the fast dna spin kit for soil sangon china was used to extract dna from 30 mg freeze dried sludge samples for qpcr analysis nanodrop one spectrophotometer thermo fisher scientific usa was used to measure the concentration and purity of dna the absolute abundance of four frequently detected args including aac 3 ii blatem 1 tetc tetw and integron inti1 were measured by qpcr a total of 71 functional genes and the 16 s rrna genes were determined in each sludge sample by using the smartchip real time pcr system magigene co ltd guangdong china reaction conditions and primers for args detection are listed in table s2 the standard curve parameters for the qpcr of functional genes are shown in figure s4 the detailed qpcr system and reaction conditions are introduced in text s4 each amplification of genes was carried out in three technical replicates 2 6 data analysis statistical analysis was performed using spss statistics 25 software armonk ny usa significant difference was analyzed using one way analysis of variance anova correlations between bacterial community and functional genes were explored by pearson correlation network analysis was performed by gephi 0 9 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 changes in water quality in effluent of sbr systems under mps stress the effluent concentrations of nitrogen total phosphorus tp and cod removal efficiency under ps mps stress are shown in fig 1 the tp and nh4 n in the four sbr systems showed no significant changes during the short term operation process and they were stably maintained at 0 20 and 0 29 mg l 1 respectively as for no3 n and no2 n the average concentrations of them during the whole experiment slightly decreased after ps mps addition table s3 wang et al 2021 also found that mps affected the ammonia oxidation performance of aerobic granular sludge and the concentration of no2 n declined the average concentrations of no3 n and no2 n in the r1 decreased by 0 3 mg l 1 compared with those in the r0 thus low concentration of mps would influence the nitrogen cycling process of sbr system but had few effects on nh4 n removal additionally the cod removal efficiencies in the four reactors were also not affected by the mps and all of them were maintained at approximately 89 5 90 1 dai et al 2020 detected cod in the effluent under mps exposure and came up with the same result overall despite of some slight fluctuations the effluent indexes in each sbr system under mps stress were stable and met the discharge demands thus the sbr system could run normally in the short term operation even under continuous stress of ps mps figure s5 depicts the changes of the properties of the sludge under mps stress during the cycles the viscosity basically increased during the cycles suggesting a promotion under the stress of mps it was reported that the viscosity of the sludge was closely and positively related to the eps contents peeters et al 2013 the reactor r1 showed the highest viscosity 6 82 0 23 mpa s after 32 cycles which probably affect the eps contents the water content basically decreased after 32 cycles in all reactors and there was no significant changes with mps addition mlss content significantly increased in all reactors after 32 cycles which might be due to the growth and reproduction of microorganisms the reactor r3 showed the highest mlss which was in line with the highest shannon and chao index fig 2 3 2 variations in microbial structures under mps stress fig 2a displays the shannon and chao indexes which are known as the representatives of the community diversity and richness the shannon index significantly increased from 4 60 to 4 87 with the augment of mps from r0 to r3 p 0 05 in addition the chao index also significantly rose to 1023 when 50 mg l 1 mps was added to r3 compared with 987 in r0 p 0 05 these results indicated that ps mps could promote the diversity and richness of the microbial community which was in line with previous research dai et al 2020 enormous specific surface area of mps can provide perfect breeding sites with various substances for microorganisms and some bacteria can even form biofilms on plastics surface maliwan et al 2021 increasing the concentration of mlss as shown in figure s5 the results of mlss were consistent with shannon and chao indexes showing the highest concentration in r3 9451 67 151 32 mg l 1 the biofilm on mps could create a new niche which exhibited differences in the microbial community compared with its surrounding environment su et al discovered that plastisphere showed a higher denitrifying activity and n2o production compared with surrounding aquatic ecosystem because of the anoxic conditions provided by biofilm su et al 2022 fig 2b illustrates the microbial community compositions at the phylum level the most dominant phylum was proteobacteria in all sbr systems followed by candidatus saccharibacteria bacteroidetes acidobacteria and chloroflexi with the ps mps addition the relative abundance of proteobacteria increased by 2 40 9 02 while candidatus saccharibacteria decreased by 8 27 20 54 it seemed that ps mps impelled the anaerobic process because candidatus saccharibacteria was more adaptable in aerobic environments according to a previous study acidobacteria preferred nutrient poor environment zhang et al 2014 and it only increased by 18 24 in r3 implying that 50 mg l 1 ps mps restrained the nutrients utilization of microbes in the sludge moreover both bacteroidetes and chloroflexi were capable of converting proteins and carbohydrates to short chain fatty acids in anaerobic environments qiu et al 2014 bacteroidetes not only metabolize saccharides and proteins but also participate in the denitrification process under the anoxic conditions li et al 2018a previous study reported that the presence of ps would promote the abundance of bacteroidetes which aligned with the results in this study fu et al 2018 all the three treatment reactors r1 r2 and r3 showed relatively higher abundance of bacteroidetes compared with the control r0 which increased by 16 74 in r1 6 34 in r2 and 14 31 in r3 on the other hand chloroflexi also decreased by 9 42 16 89 in the treatment groups r1 r3 thus ps mps can affect the synthesization of bacteriochlorophylls because chloroflexi only participates in decomposing saccharides and nitrogen removal via denitrification ji et al 2022 these results demonstrated that proteobacteria and bacteroidetes had higher tolerance to ps mps stress than candidatus saccharibacteria at the genus level figure s6 saccharibacteria genera incertae sedis was the dominant genus accounting for approximately 40 of the total detected genera relative abundance 1 0 in all sbr systems wang et al 2019 also found that saccharibacteria genera incertae sedis was the dominant bacterial genus in the sludge with intermittent aeration these bacteria prefer complex carbon source composition and they can utilize carbohydrates under all oxygen conditions and reduced nitrate under anoxic conditions aira et al 2016 the relative abundance of the saccharibacteria genera incertae sedis dropped from 43 13 r0 to 35 23 in r1 39 58 in r2 and 39 45 in r3 showing intolerance to ps mps stress thauera was a common denitrification bacterium in the sewage treatment system and it only increased in r3 by 10 61 the genus novosphingobium formerly belonged to genus sphingobium but now reclassified as an independent genus both of them were capable of reducing nitrate in some species and increased under mps exposure in all treatments showing stronger adaptation liu et al 2021b thus it seemed that nitrogen cycling in the sbr system was exuberant under constant exposure of ps mps because most of the affected genus were related to denitrification in addition the anosim and pcoa analyses of the microbial community at the phylum and genus levels were also conducted as shown in figure s7 and table s4 as shown in figure s7a the sludge samples in r3 were clearly separated with other treatments which were clustered at the phylum level however the anosim analysis showed that there was no significant differences in all reactors p 0 05 suggesting no significant difference in the community structure with mps stress at the phylum level in the contrast the anosim analysis showed that significant difference existed at the genus level p 0 034 it was reported that the existence of microplastics insignificantly changed the community structure at the phylum level during anaerobic digestion process of sludge li et al 2020b similarly wang et al 2022 discovered that the composition of dominant populations under the exposure of ps mps had no significant difference compared with the control in general mps in the effluent had no significant impacts on the community structure of sludge from sbr system at the phylum level but it did at the genus level 3 3 shifts in functional genes under ps mps stress to investigate the impacts of ps mps on the microbial metabolism under mps exposure the p n and c related functional genes in four sbr systems were quantified as shown in fig 3 the functional prediction of kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg metabolic pathways is exhibited in figure s8 as for c degradation related functional genes almost all functional genes increased when low dosage of mps was added fig 3a and fig 3e the abundance of amya apu and gcd increased more than double in r2 and all of them were related to the utilization of carbon sources on the contrary eight genes related to c degradation decreased with 50 mg l 1 mps addition fig 3i it seemed that high concentration of mps stress inhibited c degradation for c fixation related functional genes almost all functional genes increased when low dosage of mps was added fig 3b and f however these changes were not significant when 50 mg l 1 mps was added fig 3j according to the detected functional genes related to c fixation there were three c fixation pathways in the sbr system including calvin cycle rbcl reductive acetyl coa pathway acs and the 3 hydroxypropionate bicycle pcca and acca hügler and sievert 2011 only acs genes acsa acsb and acse increased in the r1 and r2 indicating that the reductive acetyl coa pathway played a dominant role in the c fixation under low dosages of the mps stress the reductive acetyl coa pathway was usually adopted by chemoautotrophic anaerobes such as detected anammox bacteria of chloroflexi and planctomycetes which could reduce inorganic carbon to organic carbon benefiting from electrons produced by nitrogen cycling hu et al 2019 song et al 2020 this could also be proved by the intense associations between hzs genes related to anammox and acs genes figure s9 the c fixation genes played a key role in the accumulation of organic compounds which were related to eps and soluble microbial products liu et al 2021a sengar and vijayanandan 2022 zhou et al 2022b and anammox bacteria were also prone to secrete more eps during their growth chen et al 2013 fig 4 depicts the changes in the eps contents under mps exposure the proteins significantly increased from 243 to 262 83 and 290 33 mg l 1 in the r1 and r2 p 0 05 respectively fig 4a similarly the eps concentration also significantly increased in r1 and r2 p 0 05 compared with that in r0 fig 4c in addition the total polysaccharide also increased in r1 wang et al 2022 observed that the methane production and the structures of the microbial community barely changed during a 30 day anaerobic digestion process under the exposure of ps mps although the activities of cellulase and coenzyme f420 were changed significantly li et al 2020b also observed similar phenomenon thus it could be predicted that mps exposure at a low concentration 0 5 and 5 mg l 1 triggered activated sludge to secreted eps leading to higher organic matters in the eps correspondingly the c fixation genes increased in this case although eps were divided into s eps lb eps and tb eps it was mainly tb eps that contributed to the changes of eps contents the contents of lb eps and s eps seldom changed under the exposure of mps the tb eps played the most critical role in the aggregation performance of sludge which benefited the growth of microorganisms proteins in the tb eps were the major contributors to the enhancement of aggregation melo et al 2022 peng et al 2022 and their concentrations were the highest in r1 fig 4a which was consistent with the abundance of n cycling genes fig 4d nirs nirk nosz and narg are all known as denitrification genes all of them increased under ps mps exposure except for nirs fig 5 a and fig 5b nitrite reductase encoded by nirk and nirs genes is crucial and plays a rate limiting step in the denitrification process aiming at converting no2 to no the nitrite reductase is located in the periplasm kuypers et al 2018 which means it is more likely to be affected by the environmental factors such as mps although the nirs gene did not exhibit consistent changes with other denitrification genes it did show the highest absolute abundance 1 37 107 copies μl 1 dna in the r1 nirs and nirk genes encode cd1 containing and cu containing nitrite reductase separately and the distinct structures of enzyme might account for the different changes of them maia and moura 2014 the absolute abundance of narg encode nitrate reductase and nosz encode nitrous oxide reductase significantly increased to 2 75 104 8 99 104 copies μl 1 dna and 1 02 106 4 54 106 copies μl 1 dna in the r1 r3 compared with the control p 0 05 respectively especially nors encode nitric oxide reductase genes were not detected in the sludge samples it was reported that cu containing nitrite reductase encoded by nirk could substitute for nors to reduce no to n2o when there was enough no casella et al 2006 ghosh et al 2007 jackson et al 1991 nxra encode nitrite oxidoreductase exhibited similar changes with other denitrification genes fig 3 implicating that the nxra gene mainly regulated nitrite reduction rather than oxidation in the treatments on the other hand amoa gene plays the critical part in nitrification encoding ammonia monooxygenase to oxidize ammonia nh3 to hydroxylamine nh2oh and it was reduced by 13 70 31 25 with mps addition fig 3 these above results indicated that ps mps could promote the process of denitrification and led to the inhibition of nitrification process david l 2016 found that phnk seemed to be indispensable for the growth and reproduction of e coli with phosphonic acids as the only phosphorus source considering kh2po4 as the only available phosphate for microorganisms the phnk genes showed a high abundance in the p cycling genes accounting for 41 49 fig 5c the atp binding protein encoded by phnk serves as binding and recruiting atp making contributions to nutrient uptake and cell metabolism through these ways the phnk mediated in the p n and c cycling wang et al 2022 2017 the c fixation and degradation related genes and eps contents significantly increased in r1 and r2 which were conformed to the changes of the phnk gene meanwhile vigorous cellular metabolisms need a great demand of phosphate resulting in the up regulation of phod and phox encode alkaline phosphatase figs 3 and c lin et al 2018 overall n fixation genes accounted for over half of the functional genes 53 57 followed by c fixation genes 27 28 c degradation genes 9 12 and p cycling genes 6 8 fig 4d ps mps stress with a low concentration such as 0 5 and 5 mg l 1 could increase the abundance of these functional genes 3 4 effects of ps mps on args fig 6 a e depicts the absolute abundances of four tested args and one integron gene inti1 in the four sbr systems and fig 6f shows the correlations among them args and integron gene all increased in the r0 along with the operation of sbr system horizontal gene transfer hgt and vertical gene transfer vgt make contributions to the dissemination of args vgt is accomplished with the reproduction and inheritance of host bacteria and hgt is associated with the spread among same or different bacteria species which occur through conjugation transduction and transformation sommer et al 2017 the total absolute abundance of aac 3 ii blatem 1 and tetw increased by 27 13 38 36 and 9 57 in r1 after 32 cycles compared with those in r0 respectively 0 5 mg l 1 ps mps promoted the transmission of these three args nevertheless the total absolute abundance of aac 3 ii and blatem 1 decreased when the concentration of ps mps rose to 5 and 50 mg l 1 for tetc gene the total absolute abundance increased by 12 50 and 8 71 in r2 and r3 after 24 cycles compared with those in r0 respectively previous studies showed that integron was used to carry gene cassettes which encoded args gillings et al 2015 the class i integron gene inti1 plays an essential role in the hgt the total absolute abundance of the inti1 gene reached 1 02 1010 copies g 1 sludge in r1 after 32 cycles fig 6e nearly doubled than that in r0 it might promote the dissemination of args to investigate the contribution of inti1 to the spread of args correlations among args and inti1 are performed in fig 6f the abundance of aac 3 ii and blatem 1 genes showed positive and significant correlations with inti1 gene p 0 05 while tetc gene was negatively correlated with inti1 for tetw gene it showed no correlation with inti1 gene r 0 2 particularly aac 3 ii and blatem 1 genes did increase in the same reactor thus a small amount of ps mps 0 5 mg l 1 could promote the abundance of inti1 gene which triggered the increase of other args such as aac 3 ii and blatem 1 high concentration of ps mps inhibited the increase of args and inti1 3 5 interactions between functional genes and args a previous study revealed that bacterial functional genes contributed more to the changes of args than bacterial community in the sludge meng et al 2021 ps mps in a low concentration increased the abundance of functional genes in sludge fig 3 and fig 4d the increased functional modules in kegg pathway also showed the same results figure s8 the vigorous metabolic activities resulted from mps exposure would affect the spread of args the redundancy analysis rda and network analyses were conducted to investigate the relationships between bacterial genera functional genes and args figs 7 and 8 as shown in fig 7 40 out of 51 functional genes including p cycling n cycling c fixation and c degradation were positively correlated with inti1 when 0 5 mg l 1 ps mps was added r1 showed the highest total absolute abundance of functional genes among all reactors and so did the inti1 figs 4d and 6e the integron gene inti1 showed positive connections to sphingobium novosphingobium unclassified alphaproteobacteria and unclassified acidobacteria fig 8 which meant they were the potential hosts of inti1 gene simultaneously these genera all showed positive connections to denitrification genes nirs nirk nosz and narg except nirs3 as mentioned before sphingobium and novosphingobium were capable of reducing nitrate and they all increased under mps exposure especially in r1 some denitrifying bacteria such as ferruginibacter and terrimonas wang et al 2020c zhang et al 2022 mainly participated in the c related processes they showed no connections with denitrification genes but correlated with c degradation and fixation genes according to the network analysis fig 8 terrimonas prefer to using aromatic compounds as the carbon source which explained the negative correlation with the c cycling genes since we added glucose to the wastewater particularly only in c fixation aac 3 ii and blatem 1 both showed positive connections to most functional genes fig 7b it was reported that the formation of eps was related to args transfer and eps could promote the dissemination and proliferation of args li et al 2021 qiu et al 2021 sphaerotilus showed positive connections with eps contents because they could secrete polysaccharide polymers around cell surface lu et al 2023 by contrast unclassified rhizobiales showed negative correlations with the eps contents it was reported that rhizobiales could secret polar polysaccharide to enhance adhesion for essential nutrients which increased survival fritts et al 2017 considering the sufficient nutrients in the wastewater it was rational for rhizobiales to secret less polar polysaccharide and showed negative correlations with the eps contents under the stress of ps mps 0 5 and 5 mg l 1 bacteria showed higher abundance in c fixation genes and secreted more eps contents fig 3b fig 3f and fig 4c which was one of the reasons for the increase in args 4 conclusions the potential effects of mps on functional modules p n and c related functional genes and args in a sbr system were investigated the sbr system could run normally under 0 5 50 mg l 1 of mps stress because there was no significant changes in the community structure at the phylum level tp cod and nh4 n in the effluent kept stable the shannon index and chao index both significantly increased under mps stress suggesting that the diversity and richness of the microbial community were promoted expression levels of p cycling n cycling c fixation and c degradation related functional genes were promoted by 0 5 5 mg l 1 of mps in this case the reductive acetyl coa pathway played a dominant role in the c fixation specially mps impelled the denitrification process and inhibited nitrification process a small amount of mps 0 5 mg l 1 promoted the abundance of inti1 aac 3 ii blatem 1 and tetw however inhibition effects occurred under a high concentration of mps most p cycling n cycling c fixation and c degradation related functional genes were positively correlated with inti1 demonstrating that they probably promoted transmission of args higher abundance in c fixation genes and more eps secretion by bacteria under low dosages of mps were the main reasons for spread of args in general the performance of sbr system was basically unchanged under ps mps exposure whereas eps secretion and expression levels of c fixation c degradation p cycling and n cycling related functional genes were enhanced favoring args dissemination these findings helped to better understand the connections between

14896,wastewater treatment plants wwtps are important sinks of microplastics mps and antibiotics resistance genes args information regarding connections between functional modules of wwtps and spread of args under mps stress is still lacking in this study correlations between p n and c related functional genes and args in a sequencing batch reactor sbr system were evaluated under polystyrene ps mps stress total p and chemical oxygen demand cod in effluent showed no significant changes under 0 5 50 mg l 1 ps mps stress within 32 cycle treatment periods of sbr while 0 5 mg l 1 ps mps affected the n cycling process ps mps 0 5 50 mg l 1 promoted the richness and diversity of microbial community in sbr and the denitrification process was exuberant ps mps with a low dosage 0 5 5 mg l 1 enhanced secretion of extracellular polymeric substances and promoted expression levels of functional genes related to c fixation c degradation p cycling and n cycling simultaneously aac 3 ii blatem 1 and tetw increased by 27 13 38 36 and 9 57 under low dosages of ps mps stress more importantly the total absolute abundance of inti1 nearly doubled 78 4 of these p n and c related functional genes were positively correlated with inti1 thus favoring transmission of args this study firstly disclosed the underlying correlations between functional modules of wwtps and spread of args under mps stress graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords antibiotics resistance genes functional genes microplastics wastewater treatment plants arg transmission data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction according to the us national oceanic and atmospheric administration plastics with particle size lower than 5 mm are considered as microplastics mps xu et al 2019 mps have been the global environmental problem due to the wide application of plastics around the world derraik 2002 jambeck et al 2015 lebreton et al 2017 mps can be easily found in different aquatic systems including marine freshwater and wastewater treatment plants wwtps estahbanati and fahrenfeld 2016 murphy et al 2016 up to now more than 45 types of mps have been detected in the wwtps mostly including polystyrene polyvinyl chloride polyamide polyethylene terephthalate polypropylene and polyethylene ali et al 2021 the use of facial scrubs is predicted to release 209 7 trillion microbeads to water environment in china each year and the wwtps account for more than 80 of the effluent mps cheung and fok 2017 generally wwtps are effective in removing mps from sewage murphy et al 2016 and lares et al 2018 found that removal efficiency of mps reached up to 98 during the sewage treatment process however most of the removed mps remain in the sludge li et al 2018b ziajahromi et al 2016 considering the micro size strong hydrophobicity potential additives and ability to absorb pollutants mps would impact microorganisms in the sludge affecting the performance of treatment process wang and wang 2018 zhao et al 2020 previous studies demonstrated that mps could deteriorate the dewaterability of excess sludge and inhibited the nitrification process li et al 2020a xu et al 2021 additionally the accumulation of mps provided new microbial niches and stimulated the interactions of microorganisms yang et al 2022 most researches are focused on the effects of mps on nitrification and denitrification processes little has been performed to reveal the impacts of mps on the entire functional modules such as c fixation c degradation p cycling and n cycling of the wwtps antibiotics are frequently detected in the effluent of the wwtps due to the stimulation of antibiotics wwtps are the source of antibiotics resistance genes args sun et al 2016 wang et al 2020a being the typical by products of wastewater treatment process activated sludge is the enormous storage of args and mobile genetic elements mges which facilitates the propagate of args xu et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 in general land application is used as the final disposal of sludge sharma et al 2017 wang et al 2022 while the args remained in the sludge probably pose potential risks for both environment and human health forsberg et al 2012 oberbeckmann et al 2017 and zhang et al 2020 observed the accumulation of antibiotic resistance bacteria on the surface of mps which might contribute to the horizontal transfer of args thus the influences of mps on args in the wwtps should be considered recent studies found that mps selectively promoted the enrichment of args such as sul1 fabi and erme and mges inti1 in the wwtps dai et al 2020 wang et al 2020b zhou et al 2022a nevertheless little is known about the connections between the functional modules c fixation c degradation p cycling and n cycling and spread of args in the wwtps under mps stress in this study the impacts of mps on functional modules and args in a sequencing batch reactor sbr system were investigated polystyrene ps is widely used in packaging and containers being one of the most frequently detected mps in the influent and effluent of wwtps ali et al 2021 franco et al 2021 sol et al 2020 hence ps was selected as one of the typical mps firstly the performance of effluent in the lab scale sbr system with ps mps addition was evaluated secondly the influences of ps mps on microbial community and p n and c related functional genes were explored subsequently the impacts of ps mps on the spread of args were evaluated finally connections between these functional genes and args under ps mps exposure were established 2 materials and methods 2 1 sludge samples and mps ps mps powder mainly 80 160 um was provided by dongguan jing tian raw materials of plastics co ltd china and was filtered using a 100 200 mesh sieve the scanning electron microscopy sem and particle diameter of the ps mps were listed in figure s1 and figure s2 respectively the morphology of the mps was spherical with d50 of 77 6 μm which was consistent with previous reports that approximately 80 of mps were less than 100 μm in wwtps jiang et al 2020 yang et al 2021 activated sludge was sampled in the sludge return unit of a wwtp anaerobic anoxic oxic process treatment capacity 40 000 m3 d 1 in yangling shaanxi china the background concentration of mps in the sludge was approximately 0 03 mg l 1 yang et al 2021 the presence of antibiotics in the effluent of the wwtp was listed in table s1 the concentration of tetracycline reached up to 18 672 ng l 1 was the most abundant beta lactam antibiotics were seldom detected owing to the hydrolysis after the sludge was sampled from the wwtp it was aerated in a 15 l sbr system for 24 h to remove organic matters before the acclimation the sbr system was kept running until the effluent was stable nh4 n 0 5 mg l 1 cod 50 mg l 1 2 2 sbr system establishment four 3 l sbr systems 14 cm internal diameter and 20 cm height were set up to simulate the sewage treatment process under mps exposure each cycle of sbr consisted of feeding 20 min anaerobic stage 40 min aerobic stage 480 min settling 90 min decanting 20 min and idle 70 min the aeration rate was maintained at 60 l h 1 at the feeding stage one liter of synthetic wastewater details are introduced in text s1 in the supporting information was added to each sbr system ma et al 2016 mps concentration in influent in a typical wwtp varied from 1 to 10 044 particles l 1 approximately 55 mg l 1 jiang et al 2020 sun et al 2019 therefore the concentrations of ps mps were set as 0 5 5 and 50 mg l 1 and they were separately added into three sbr systems marked as r1 r2 and r3 respectively the rest one was set as control r0 no ps addition a certain amount of waste activated sludge was added to the sbr system and the concentration of sludge in the sbr was approximately 8000 mg l 1 and the ph was 7 5 8 effluent was collected every 2 cycles and the concentration of nitrogen phosphorus and cod removal efficiency were measured after different cycles sludge samples containing mps were collected at the idle stage and were stored at 80 c before microbial community and genes analysis in this process the mps were not separated from the sludge samples to avoid the interference of chemical reagents on microbial community during mps extraction 2 3 physicochemical property analysis of sludge samples extracellular polymeric substances eps commonly consisted of tightly bound eps tb eps loosely bound eps lb eps and soluble eps s eps zhang et al 2016 the analyses of the eps are shown in text s2 dissolved organic carbon doc of different kinds of eps was measured by a total organic carbon analyzer toc multin cuv analytic jena germany eps were calculated as doc mixed liquor suspended solids mlss proteins were measured by the lowry folin method polysaccharides were quantified following the phenol sulfuric acid method cod nitrogen and phosphorus were measured using standard methods as previously reported rice et al 2012 all experiments were conducted in triplicate 2 4 microbial community analysis the microbial community of sludge samples were explored by illumina miseq sequencer in sangon biotech co ltd shanghai china the e z n a mag bind soil dna kit was used to extract dna from 0 5 g fresh sludge samples following the manufacture s instruction the extracted dna was measured by agarose gel electrophoresis for integrity and by qubit fluorometric quantification for purity the sequence reads were clustered into operational taxonomic units otus at a similarity threshold of 97 on the i sanger platform the detailed processes are illustrated in text s3 2 5 quantification of args and functional genes according to the results of metagenomic high throughput sequencing multidrug tetracycline beta lactam and aminoglycoside resistance genes were the top 4 types of args figure s3 the multidrug type of args is affected by multiple antibiotics therefore the following three types of args tetracycline tetc tetw beta lactam blatem 1 and aminoglycoside aac 3 ii were chosen as the targets in this study also the class i integron inti1 plays an important role in gene transfer among bacteria it is frequently reported to carry one or more gene cassettes that encode antibiotic resistance ma et al 2011 thus inti1 was also chosen to provide insight into args dissemination potentials the fast dna spin kit for soil sangon china was used to extract dna from 30 mg freeze dried sludge samples for qpcr analysis nanodrop one spectrophotometer thermo fisher scientific usa was used to measure the concentration and purity of dna the absolute abundance of four frequently detected args including aac 3 ii blatem 1 tetc tetw and integron inti1 were measured by qpcr a total of 71 functional genes and the 16 s rrna genes were determined in each sludge sample by using the smartchip real time pcr system magigene co ltd guangdong china reaction conditions and primers for args detection are listed in table s2 the standard curve parameters for the qpcr of functional genes are shown in figure s4 the detailed qpcr system and reaction conditions are introduced in text s4 each amplification of genes was carried out in three technical replicates 2 6 data analysis statistical analysis was performed using spss statistics 25 software armonk ny usa significant difference was analyzed using one way analysis of variance anova correlations between bacterial community and functional genes were explored by pearson correlation network analysis was performed by gephi 0 9 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 changes in water quality in effluent of sbr systems under mps stress the effluent concentrations of nitrogen total phosphorus tp and cod removal efficiency under ps mps stress are shown in fig 1 the tp and nh4 n in the four sbr systems showed no significant changes during the short term operation process and they were stably maintained at 0 20 and 0 29 mg l 1 respectively as for no3 n and no2 n the average concentrations of them during the whole experiment slightly decreased after ps mps addition table s3 wang et al 2021 also found that mps affected the ammonia oxidation performance of aerobic granular sludge and the concentration of no2 n declined the average concentrations of no3 n and no2 n in the r1 decreased by 0 3 mg l 1 compared with those in the r0 thus low concentration of mps would influence the nitrogen cycling process of sbr system but had few effects on nh4 n removal additionally the cod removal efficiencies in the four reactors were also not affected by the mps and all of them were maintained at approximately 89 5 90 1 dai et al 2020 detected cod in the effluent under mps exposure and came up with the same result overall despite of some slight fluctuations the effluent indexes in each sbr system under mps stress were stable and met the discharge demands thus the sbr system could run normally in the short term operation even under continuous stress of ps mps figure s5 depicts the changes of the properties of the sludge under mps stress during the cycles the viscosity basically increased during the cycles suggesting a promotion under the stress of mps it was reported that the viscosity of the sludge was closely and positively related to the eps contents peeters et al 2013 the reactor r1 showed the highest viscosity 6 82 0 23 mpa s after 32 cycles which probably affect the eps contents the water content basically decreased after 32 cycles in all reactors and there was no significant changes with mps addition mlss content significantly increased in all reactors after 32 cycles which might be due to the growth and reproduction of microorganisms the reactor r3 showed the highest mlss which was in line with the highest shannon and chao index fig 2 3 2 variations in microbial structures under mps stress fig 2a displays the shannon and chao indexes which are known as the representatives of the community diversity and richness the shannon index significantly increased from 4 60 to 4 87 with the augment of mps from r0 to r3 p 0 05 in addition the chao index also significantly rose to 1023 when 50 mg l 1 mps was added to r3 compared with 987 in r0 p 0 05 these results indicated that ps mps could promote the diversity and richness of the microbial community which was in line with previous research dai et al 2020 enormous specific surface area of mps can provide perfect breeding sites with various substances for microorganisms and some bacteria can even form biofilms on plastics surface maliwan et al 2021 increasing the concentration of mlss as shown in figure s5 the results of mlss were consistent with shannon and chao indexes showing the highest concentration in r3 9451 67 151 32 mg l 1 the biofilm on mps could create a new niche which exhibited differences in the microbial community compared with its surrounding environment su et al discovered that plastisphere showed a higher denitrifying activity and n2o production compared with surrounding aquatic ecosystem because of the anoxic conditions provided by biofilm su et al 2022 fig 2b illustrates the microbial community compositions at the phylum level the most dominant phylum was proteobacteria in all sbr systems followed by candidatus saccharibacteria bacteroidetes acidobacteria and chloroflexi with the ps mps addition the relative abundance of proteobacteria increased by 2 40 9 02 while candidatus saccharibacteria decreased by 8 27 20 54 it seemed that ps mps impelled the anaerobic process because candidatus saccharibacteria was more adaptable in aerobic environments according to a previous study acidobacteria preferred nutrient poor environment zhang et al 2014 and it only increased by 18 24 in r3 implying that 50 mg l 1 ps mps restrained the nutrients utilization of microbes in the sludge moreover both bacteroidetes and chloroflexi were capable of converting proteins and carbohydrates to short chain fatty acids in anaerobic environments qiu et al 2014 bacteroidetes not only metabolize saccharides and proteins but also participate in the denitrification process under the anoxic conditions li et al 2018a previous study reported that the presence of ps would promote the abundance of bacteroidetes which aligned with the results in this study fu et al 2018 all the three treatment reactors r1 r2 and r3 showed relatively higher abundance of bacteroidetes compared with the control r0 which increased by 16 74 in r1 6 34 in r2 and 14 31 in r3 on the other hand chloroflexi also decreased by 9 42 16 89 in the treatment groups r1 r3 thus ps mps can affect the synthesization of bacteriochlorophylls because chloroflexi only participates in decomposing saccharides and nitrogen removal via denitrification ji et al 2022 these results demonstrated that proteobacteria and bacteroidetes had higher tolerance to ps mps stress than candidatus saccharibacteria at the genus level figure s6 saccharibacteria genera incertae sedis was the dominant genus accounting for approximately 40 of the total detected genera relative abundance 1 0 in all sbr systems wang et al 2019 also found that saccharibacteria genera incertae sedis was the dominant bacterial genus in the sludge with intermittent aeration these bacteria prefer complex carbon source composition and they can utilize carbohydrates under all oxygen conditions and reduced nitrate under anoxic conditions aira et al 2016 the relative abundance of the saccharibacteria genera incertae sedis dropped from 43 13 r0 to 35 23 in r1 39 58 in r2 and 39 45 in r3 showing intolerance to ps mps stress thauera was a common denitrification bacterium in the sewage treatment system and it only increased in r3 by 10 61 the genus novosphingobium formerly belonged to genus sphingobium but now reclassified as an independent genus both of them were capable of reducing nitrate in some species and increased under mps exposure in all treatments showing stronger adaptation liu et al 2021b thus it seemed that nitrogen cycling in the sbr system was exuberant under constant exposure of ps mps because most of the affected genus were related to denitrification in addition the anosim and pcoa analyses of the microbial community at the phylum and genus levels were also conducted as shown in figure s7 and table s4 as shown in figure s7a the sludge samples in r3 were clearly separated with other treatments which were clustered at the phylum level however the anosim analysis showed that there was no significant differences in all reactors p 0 05 suggesting no significant difference in the community structure with mps stress at the phylum level in the contrast the anosim analysis showed that significant difference existed at the genus level p 0 034 it was reported that the existence of microplastics insignificantly changed the community structure at the phylum level during anaerobic digestion process of sludge li et al 2020b similarly wang et al 2022 discovered that the composition of dominant populations under the exposure of ps mps had no significant difference compared with the control in general mps in the effluent had no significant impacts on the community structure of sludge from sbr system at the phylum level but it did at the genus level 3 3 shifts in functional genes under ps mps stress to investigate the impacts of ps mps on the microbial metabolism under mps exposure the p n and c related functional genes in four sbr systems were quantified as shown in fig 3 the functional prediction of kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg metabolic pathways is exhibited in figure s8 as for c degradation related functional genes almost all functional genes increased when low dosage of mps was added fig 3a and fig 3e the abundance of amya apu and gcd increased more than double in r2 and all of them were related to the utilization of carbon sources on the contrary eight genes related to c degradation decreased with 50 mg l 1 mps addition fig 3i it seemed that high concentration of mps stress inhibited c degradation for c fixation related functional genes almost all functional genes increased when low dosage of mps was added fig 3b and f however these changes were not significant when 50 mg l 1 mps was added fig 3j according to the detected functional genes related to c fixation there were three c fixation pathways in the sbr system including calvin cycle rbcl reductive acetyl coa pathway acs and the 3 hydroxypropionate bicycle pcca and acca hügler and sievert 2011 only acs genes acsa acsb and acse increased in the r1 and r2 indicating that the reductive acetyl coa pathway played a dominant role in the c fixation under low dosages of the mps stress the reductive acetyl coa pathway was usually adopted by chemoautotrophic anaerobes such as detected anammox bacteria of chloroflexi and planctomycetes which could reduce inorganic carbon to organic carbon benefiting from electrons produced by nitrogen cycling hu et al 2019 song et al 2020 this could also be proved by the intense associations between hzs genes related to anammox and acs genes figure s9 the c fixation genes played a key role in the accumulation of organic compounds which were related to eps and soluble microbial products liu et al 2021a sengar and vijayanandan 2022 zhou et al 2022b and anammox bacteria were also prone to secrete more eps during their growth chen et al 2013 fig 4 depicts the changes in the eps contents under mps exposure the proteins significantly increased from 243 to 262 83 and 290 33 mg l 1 in the r1 and r2 p 0 05 respectively fig 4a similarly the eps concentration also significantly increased in r1 and r2 p 0 05 compared with that in r0 fig 4c in addition the total polysaccharide also increased in r1 wang et al 2022 observed that the methane production and the structures of the microbial community barely changed during a 30 day anaerobic digestion process under the exposure of ps mps although the activities of cellulase and coenzyme f420 were changed significantly li et al 2020b also observed similar phenomenon thus it could be predicted that mps exposure at a low concentration 0 5 and 5 mg l 1 triggered activated sludge to secreted eps leading to higher organic matters in the eps correspondingly the c fixation genes increased in this case although eps were divided into s eps lb eps and tb eps it was mainly tb eps that contributed to the changes of eps contents the contents of lb eps and s eps seldom changed under the exposure of mps the tb eps played the most critical role in the aggregation performance of sludge which benefited the growth of microorganisms proteins in the tb eps were the major contributors to the enhancement of aggregation melo et al 2022 peng et al 2022 and their concentrations were the highest in r1 fig 4a which was consistent with the abundance of n cycling genes fig 4d nirs nirk nosz and narg are all known as denitrification genes all of them increased under ps mps exposure except for nirs fig 5 a and fig 5b nitrite reductase encoded by nirk and nirs genes is crucial and plays a rate limiting step in the denitrification process aiming at converting no2 to no the nitrite reductase is located in the periplasm kuypers et al 2018 which means it is more likely to be affected by the environmental factors such as mps although the nirs gene did not exhibit consistent changes with other denitrification genes it did show the highest absolute abundance 1 37 107 copies μl 1 dna in the r1 nirs and nirk genes encode cd1 containing and cu containing nitrite reductase separately and the distinct structures of enzyme might account for the different changes of them maia and moura 2014 the absolute abundance of narg encode nitrate reductase and nosz encode nitrous oxide reductase significantly increased to 2 75 104 8 99 104 copies μl 1 dna and 1 02 106 4 54 106 copies μl 1 dna in the r1 r3 compared with the control p 0 05 respectively especially nors encode nitric oxide reductase genes were not detected in the sludge samples it was reported that cu containing nitrite reductase encoded by nirk could substitute for nors to reduce no to n2o when there was enough no casella et al 2006 ghosh et al 2007 jackson et al 1991 nxra encode nitrite oxidoreductase exhibited similar changes with other denitrification genes fig 3 implicating that the nxra gene mainly regulated nitrite reduction rather than oxidation in the treatments on the other hand amoa gene plays the critical part in nitrification encoding ammonia monooxygenase to oxidize ammonia nh3 to hydroxylamine nh2oh and it was reduced by 13 70 31 25 with mps addition fig 3 these above results indicated that ps mps could promote the process of denitrification and led to the inhibition of nitrification process david l 2016 found that phnk seemed to be indispensable for the growth and reproduction of e coli with phosphonic acids as the only phosphorus source considering kh2po4 as the only available phosphate for microorganisms the phnk genes showed a high abundance in the p cycling genes accounting for 41 49 fig 5c the atp binding protein encoded by phnk serves as binding and recruiting atp making contributions to nutrient uptake and cell metabolism through these ways the phnk mediated in the p n and c cycling wang et al 2022 2017 the c fixation and degradation related genes and eps contents significantly increased in r1 and r2 which were conformed to the changes of the phnk gene meanwhile vigorous cellular metabolisms need a great demand of phosphate resulting in the up regulation of phod and phox encode alkaline phosphatase figs 3 and c lin et al 2018 overall n fixation genes accounted for over half of the functional genes 53 57 followed by c fixation genes 27 28 c degradation genes 9 12 and p cycling genes 6 8 fig 4d ps mps stress with a low concentration such as 0 5 and 5 mg l 1 could increase the abundance of these functional genes 3 4 effects of ps mps on args fig 6 a e depicts the absolute abundances of four tested args and one integron gene inti1 in the four sbr systems and fig 6f shows the correlations among them args and integron gene all increased in the r0 along with the operation of sbr system horizontal gene transfer hgt and vertical gene transfer vgt make contributions to the dissemination of args vgt is accomplished with the reproduction and inheritance of host bacteria and hgt is associated with the spread among same or different bacteria species which occur through conjugation transduction and transformation sommer et al 2017 the total absolute abundance of aac 3 ii blatem 1 and tetw increased by 27 13 38 36 and 9 57 in r1 after 32 cycles compared with those in r0 respectively 0 5 mg l 1 ps mps promoted the transmission of these three args nevertheless the total absolute abundance of aac 3 ii and blatem 1 decreased when the concentration of ps mps rose to 5 and 50 mg l 1 for tetc gene the total absolute abundance increased by 12 50 and 8 71 in r2 and r3 after 24 cycles compared with those in r0 respectively previous studies showed that integron was used to carry gene cassettes which encoded args gillings et al 2015 the class i integron gene inti1 plays an essential role in the hgt the total absolute abundance of the inti1 gene reached 1 02 1010 copies g 1 sludge in r1 after 32 cycles fig 6e nearly doubled than that in r0 it might promote the dissemination of args to investigate the contribution of inti1 to the spread of args correlations among args and inti1 are performed in fig 6f the abundance of aac 3 ii and blatem 1 genes showed positive and significant correlations with inti1 gene p 0 05 while tetc gene was negatively correlated with inti1 for tetw gene it showed no correlation with inti1 gene r 0 2 particularly aac 3 ii and blatem 1 genes did increase in the same reactor thus a small amount of ps mps 0 5 mg l 1 could promote the abundance of inti1 gene which triggered the increase of other args such as aac 3 ii and blatem 1 high concentration of ps mps inhibited the increase of args and inti1 3 5 interactions between functional genes and args a previous study revealed that bacterial functional genes contributed more to the changes of args than bacterial community in the sludge meng et al 2021 ps mps in a low concentration increased the abundance of functional genes in sludge fig 3 and fig 4d the increased functional modules in kegg pathway also showed the same results figure s8 the vigorous metabolic activities resulted from mps exposure would affect the spread of args the redundancy analysis rda and network analyses were conducted to investigate the relationships between bacterial genera functional genes and args figs 7 and 8 as shown in fig 7 40 out of 51 functional genes including p cycling n cycling c fixation and c degradation were positively correlated with inti1 when 0 5 mg l 1 ps mps was added r1 showed the highest total absolute abundance of functional genes among all reactors and so did the inti1 figs 4d and 6e the integron gene inti1 showed positive connections to sphingobium novosphingobium unclassified alphaproteobacteria and unclassified acidobacteria fig 8 which meant they were the potential hosts of inti1 gene simultaneously these genera all showed positive connections to denitrification genes nirs nirk nosz and narg except nirs3 as mentioned before sphingobium and novosphingobium were capable of reducing nitrate and they all increased under mps exposure especially in r1 some denitrifying bacteria such as ferruginibacter and terrimonas wang et al 2020c zhang et al 2022 mainly participated in the c related processes they showed no connections with denitrification genes but correlated with c degradation and fixation genes according to the network analysis fig 8 terrimonas prefer to using aromatic compounds as the carbon source which explained the negative correlation with the c cycling genes since we added glucose to the wastewater particularly only in c fixation aac 3 ii and blatem 1 both showed positive connections to most functional genes fig 7b it was reported that the formation of eps was related to args transfer and eps could promote the dissemination and proliferation of args li et al 2021 qiu et al 2021 sphaerotilus showed positive connections with eps contents because they could secrete polysaccharide polymers around cell surface lu et al 2023 by contrast unclassified rhizobiales showed negative correlations with the eps contents it was reported that rhizobiales could secret polar polysaccharide to enhance adhesion for essential nutrients which increased survival fritts et al 2017 considering the sufficient nutrients in the wastewater it was rational for rhizobiales to secret less polar polysaccharide and showed negative correlations with the eps contents under the stress of ps mps 0 5 and 5 mg l 1 bacteria showed higher abundance in c fixation genes and secreted more eps contents fig 3b fig 3f and fig 4c which was one of the reasons for the increase in args 4 conclusions the potential effects of mps on functional modules p n and c related functional genes and args in a sbr system were investigated the sbr system could run normally under 0 5 50 mg l 1 of mps stress because there was no significant changes in the community structure at the phylum level tp cod and nh4 n in the effluent kept stable the shannon index and chao index both significantly increased under mps stress suggesting that the diversity and richness of the microbial community were promoted expression levels of p cycling n cycling c fixation and c degradation related functional genes were promoted by 0 5 5 mg l 1 of mps in this case the reductive acetyl coa pathway played a dominant role in the c fixation specially mps impelled the denitrification process and inhibited nitrification process a small amount of mps 0 5 mg l 1 promoted the abundance of inti1 aac 3 ii blatem 1 and tetw however inhibition effects occurred under a high concentration of mps most p cycling n cycling c fixation and c degradation related functional genes were positively correlated with inti1 demonstrating that they probably promoted transmission of args higher abundance in c fixation genes and more eps secretion by bacteria under low dosages of mps were the main reasons for spread of args in general the performance of sbr system was basically unchanged under ps mps exposure whereas eps secretion and expression levels of c fixation c degradation p cycling and n cycling related functional genes were enhanced favoring args dissemination these findings helped to better understand the connections between functional modules and args in wwtps contributing to the control of args in wastewater treatment further study should be conducted to further explore the effects of plastisphere in the sbr system

14897,developing practical and cost effective adsorbents with satisfactory mercury hg remediation capability is indispensable for aquatic environment safety and public health herein a recyclable hierarchical mos2 fe3o4 nanocomposite by in situ growth of mos2 nanosheets on the surface of fe3o4 nanospheres is presented for the selective removal of hg ii from aquatic samples it exhibited high adsorption capacity 1923 5 mg g 1 fast kinetics k 2 0 56 mg g 1 min 1 broad working ph range 2 11 excellent selectivity k d 1 0 107 ml g 1 and great reusability removal efficiency 90 after 20 cycles in particular removal efficiencies of up to 97 for different hg ii concentrations 10 1000 μg l 1 in natural water and industrial effluents confirmed the practicability of mos2 fe3o4 the possible mechanism for effective hg ii removal was discussed by a series of characterization analyses which was attributed to the alteration of the mos2 structure and the surface coordination of hg s the accessibility of surface sulfur sites and the diffusion of hg ii in the solid liquid system were enhanced due to the advantage of the expanded interlayer spacing 0 96 nm and the hierarchical structure this study suggests that mos2 fe3o4 is a promising material for hg ii removal in actual scenarios and provides a feasible approach by rationally constructing hierarchical structures to promote the

mercury hg is a toxic metal that can volatilize into the atmosphere following long distance transboundary transport and deposition on the earth s surface gworek et al 2020 mcnutt 2013 according to the global mercury assessment 2018 unep 2019 the aquatic environment is a significant sink for the global hg cycle in which more than 3000 tons of hg are deposited annually in addition large amounts of hg are released into effluents and sludge through many industrial processes including mining non ferrous metal smelting and textile production resulting in increasing water pollution ji et al 2022 li et al 2022b liu et al 2016 xing et al 2022 although the hg concentration in water is generally low its concentration in organisms can be biomagnified 106 7 times bravo et al 2014 which poses global environmental and health risks inorganic divalent hg hg ii is the main hg species in water environments ni chadhain et al 2006 and long term chronic hg ii exposure can adversely damage organs e g the kidney and liver clifton 2007 zahir et al 2005 owing to the complexity of the water environment conventional methods such as chemical precipitation coagulation and electrolysis are still inefficient for hg ii removal li et al 2022a vikrant and kim 2019 therefore it is imperative to develop advanced wastewater treatment techniques for hg ii removal chen et al 2022 lavoie et al 2013 various treatment technologies have been used to remove toxic contaminants from wastewater including ion exchange siva et al 2015 adsorption ai et al 2016 hong et al 2022 membrane separation bruno et al 2021 electrochemical treatment kim et al 2018 tunsu and wickman 2018 advanced oxidation processes khiem et al 2023a khiem et al 2023b liu et al 2023 and bioremediation franco et al 2018 among these methods adsorption is regarded as promising for large scale applications owing to its cost effectiveness operational flexibility and reusability ji et al 2021 however traditional adsorbents such as activated carbon zeolites mesoporous silica and resins suffer from slow kinetics low adsorption capacity and poor regeneration ability and selectivity which limit their application in the remediation of hg contamination lu and astruc 2018 recently several classes of nanomaterials have been explored as next generation hg ii adsorbents in water including mesoporous carbons metal organic frameworks mofs and covalent organic frameworks cofs nevertheless most materials face problems of complicated synthesis steps and expensive raw materials huang et al 2017 mon et al 2016 shin et al 2007 sun et al 2017 yee et al 2013 the preparation of mesoporous carbon is inevitable to use strong acid reagents shin et al 2007 and sulfur functionalized mofs typically require relatively expensive ligands mon et al 2016 yee et al 2013 in addition thiol modified cofs efficiently decreased the hg ii concentration in water however their synthesis time and cost need to be further controlled huang et al 2017 sun et al 2017 thus the design of highly efficient and cost effective adsorbents for hg ii immobilization is of great significance as a typical two dimensional transition metal dichalcogenide material molybdenum disulfide mos2 exhibits unique photoelectric characteristics and excellent adsorption catalysis activity which leads to its wide application in energy storage and environmental remediation ishag and sun 2021 wang and mi 2017 according to the lewis acid base theory soft basic sulfur has a strong affinity toward the soft acid hg which makes mos2 with abundant sulfur atoms a potential candidate for efficient hg ii adsorbents jia et al 2018 jia et al 2017 subbaiah et al 2021 however the adsorption performance of mos2 is inevitably limited due to the inadequate layer spacing interlayer stacking and agglomerate kumar et al 2019 wang et al 2020 in addition the synthesis of mos2 is relatively expensive and the formation of hg containing wastes may cause secondary pollution jiang et al 2023a li et al 2022b thus it is still challenging to overcome these drawbacks to obtain recyclable and cost effective mos2 adsorbents with highly exposed surface sulfur atoms for water purification jiang et al 2023b li et al 2022e yang et al 2020 given the paramagnetic and earth abundant properties of fe3o4 ahmad et al 2020 wan et al 2021 it could be combined with mos2 to form hierarchical composites and act as an isolator to inhibit the agglomeration of mos2 and improve the accessibility of active sites li et al 2022c zhang et al 2017 herein a hierarchical mos2 fe3o4 nanocomposite was constructed by in situ growth of mos2 nanosheets on the surface of fe3o4 nanospheres using a hydrothermal method to efficiently and selectively remove hg ii from water the alterations of structure and surface chemical environment on mos2 fe3o4 after adsorption were analyzed by various characterizations to explore the mechanism of hg ii capture the hg ii removal performance of mos2 fe3o4 was optimized in terms of adsorption capacity working ph range adsorption kinetics anti interference capability and reusability and was effectively applied to hg ii removal in natural water and power plant wastewater based on the design of structure and composition this study provides a novel and efficient adsorbent for hg ii removal in actual scenarios promoting real applications of mos2 based materials in water purification 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of hierarchical mos2 fe3o4 nanocomposites fe3o4 nanospheres were prepared using a typical solvothermal method according to the literature deng et al 2005 briefly 1 35 g 5 mmol of fecl3 6h2o was dissolved in 35 ml of ethylene glycol followed by the addition of 3 6 g of c2h3o2na 3h2o and 1 0 g of poly ethylene glycol after stirring for 30 min until the solid was completely dissolved the mixture was transferred into a 50 ml teflon lined stainless steel autoclave which was then maintained at 200 c for 8 h the product was magnetically collected washed several times with deionized water diw and ethanol and then dried at 60 c under vacuum for further utilization hierarchical mos2 fe3o4 nanocomposites were prepared using a hydrothermal method in detail 1 24 g 1 mmol of nh4 6mo7o24 4h2o and 2 28 g 30 mmol of thiourea were dissolved in 35 ml of diw which was then added to 50 mg of as synthesized fe3o4 nanospheres the above mixture was processed via ultrasonication for 10 min to disperse well and then transferred into a 50 ml teflon lined stainless steel autoclave which was maintained at 180 c for 20 h the product was centrifuged and washed several times with diw and ethanol and then dried at 60 c under vacuum to obtain the final mos2 fe3o4 nanocomposites for comparison bare mos2 nanosheets were also prepared without fe3o4 nanospheres all the chemicals and detailed information on the characterization utilized in this study are provided in the supporting information 2 2 adsorption experiments the hg ii stock solution 50 mg l 1 was prepared by diluting the hg standard solution hgcl2 1000 mg l 1 in diw then hg ii solutions with various initial concentrations were prepared by diluting the stock solution or standard solution the adsorption kinetics were studied at different hg ii concentrations 0 1 1 and 10 mg l 1 the adsorption isotherms were determined in the range of hg ii concentrations from 10 to 400 mg l 1 after 12 h of adsorption at 15 25 and 35 c the initial ph of the hg ii solution was adjusted using hcl or naoh 0 1 mol l 1 for the desorption regeneration tests the mos2 fe3o4 after hg ii adsorption was eluted with a 1 m v thiourea solution containing 0 01 mol l 1 hcl batch experiments were conducted by adding 10 mg adsorbents to 250 ml quartz beakers containing 100 ml reaction solution at room temperature 25 c unless specified otherwise continuous oscillation 180 rpm was maintained in a shaker to reduce the mass transfer resistance during adsorption the specific operation conditions e g ph initial hg ii concentration and solution volume of the adsorption experiments are shown in each figure the reaction solutions were sampled at predetermined time intervals and all samples were filtered with polyether sulfone syringe filters 0 22 μm before analyzing the residual heavy metal concentrations 2 3 sample collection adsorption experiments for hg ii removal were performed in natural water and industrial wastewater matrices using mos2 fe3o4 nanocomposites samples of natural water tap water lake water taihu lake southeast china and groundwater jiangsu southeast china were collected separately in addition stream water near an abandoned hg mine shaanxi northwest china was collected from five locations for industrial wastewater the influent before desulfurization dw and effluent after desulfurization cw were sampled at six locations at a coal fired power plant hebei north china after collection all water samples were filtered with a polyether sulfone membrane 0 45 μm and stored at 20 c different concentrations 10 100 and 1000 μg l 1 of hg ii spiked solutions were prepared by adding hg ii stock solution to the above samples before the adsorption experiment 2 4 analytical methods the concentrations of hg ii and other metal cations were measured using an automated total mercury analytical system following the usepa method 1631 or inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer all the experimental data were the averages of three replicate experiments with the standard deviation indicated by error bars adsorption kinetics were described using a pseudo second order kinetic model the equilibrium adsorption isotherms were fitted using the langmuir and freundlich models all the details of the adsorption kinetics and adsorption isotherm model fittings can be found in the supporting information 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of hierarchical mos2 fe3o4 the synthesis process of the hierarchical mos2 fe3o4 nanocomposites is illustrated in fig 1 a in which mos2 nanosheets were directly grown on fe3o4 nanospheres through a one step hydrothermal method insufficient sulfidation of the molybdenum precursor introduces structural defects and enlarged interlayer spacing into the mos2 nanosheets due to the controlled temperature of the hydrothermal reaction li et al 2021 the existence of excess nh4 produced by thiourea can weaken the van der waals forces between the mos2 molecular layers which expands the 002 plane spacing in addition the formation energy of the metallic 1t phase is reduced by nh4 to promote the production of the 1t 2h mixed phase in mos2 chen et al 2019 scanning electron microscopy sem fig 1b and transmission electron microscopy tem fig 1c images show that the mos2 nanosheets in mos2 fe3o4 were vertically aligned on the surface of the fe3o4 nanospheres compared with the bare mos2 nanosheets fig s1 this three dimensional microstructure is beneficial for inhibiting the stacking of neighboring mos2 layers and enhancing mass transfer in the adsorption process as seen from the high resolution tem hrtem images fig 1d the expanded interlayer spacing of mos2 in the nanocomposites was measured to 0 96 nm typically 0 62 nm wang and mi 2017 which is favorable for the diffusion of hg ii in adjacent mos2 layers in addition the interrupted lattice fringes were widely dispersed on the 002 plane of mos2 indicating the formation of structural defects that could be used as ion diffusion channels the tem energy dispersive spectroscopy eds images in fig 1e confirm that mo s fe and o were homogeneously distributed along the mos2 fe3o4 nanocomposites and the mos2 nanosheets were intercalated into the surface of the fe3o4 nanospheres to form a hierarchical structure the x ray diffraction xrd pattern in fig 1f indicates that the characteristic peaks of mos2 fe3o4 match well with the data for the as prepared fe3o4 and bare mos2 two strong diffraction peaks emerged at 2θ 9 2 and 18 4 which correspond to the 002 and 004 planes of the intercalated mos2 respectively according to the calculation results of the bragg equation the interlayer distance of mos2 nanosheets in the mos2 fe3o4 nanocomposites was enlarged significantly to 0 96 nm which agreed well with the tem analysis results the raman spectra of bare mos2 nanosheets figs 1g and s2 show that the characteristic signals at 383 and 407 cm 1 are attributed to two main acoustic phonon modes e2g and a1g of typical 2h phase mos2 after integration with fe3o4 several strong peaks appeared at 239 284 339 and 407 cm 1 which are indexed to j2 e1g j3 and a1g of the 1t phase mos2 respectively this reveals that the mos2 in the mos2 fe3o4 nanocomposites comprises 1t and 2h phases luo et al 2019 to quantify the proportion of different phases in mos2 x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps was employed to identify the element composition and atomic structure fig s3a the high resolution xps spectra of mo 3d and s 2p in figs s3b and s3d illustrate that all the characteristic peaks of mos2 fe3o4 are slightly shifted toward a lower binding energy compared with the bare mos2 according to the deconvolution calculation of the xps fitting results table s1 the 1t phase content in mos2 is estimated to increase from 55 to 65 after integration the abundant metallic 1t phase of mos2 in mos2 fe3o4 nanocomposites can accelerate interfacial charge transfer dai et al 2021 li et al 2021 which facilitates the combination of positive hg ii and negative sulfur on the material surface in addition the characteristic peaks of o 1 s at 531 05 and 531 95 ev are attributed to the existence of fe o and mo o bonds between mos2 and fe3o4 fig s3c respectively implying that the composites are combined by chemical bonds rather than just physical blending benefiting from the introduction of fe3o4 the composites showed stronger hydrophobicity than the bare mos2 as demonstrated in water contact angle tests fig s4 this indicates that inorganic ions are more accessible and contributes to better adsorption performance qie et al 2022 as shown in fig s5 and table s2 the brunauer emmett teller surface area of mos2 fe3o4 20 6 m2 g 1 is slightly lower than that of bare mos2 24 6 m2 g 1 and the average pore size decreases from 19 4 to 18 5 nm due to the combination of the two components magnetic characterization measured by a vibrating sample magnetometer at 300 k demonstrated that the mos2 fe3o4 nanocomposites exhibited superparamagnetic properties little remanence and coercivity due to the introduction of ultrafine magnetite nanoparticles fig 1h the decrease in the saturated magnetization value of mos2 fe3o4 in comparison with that of fe3o4 provides further evidence that the surface of the fe3o4 nanospheres is covered by mos2 nanosheets the mos2 fe3o4 nanocomposites were well dispersed in water to form a black suspension through vigorous shaking by applying an external magnetic field the composites can be rapidly separated from the solution these results verify that mos2 fe3o4 possesses excellent dispersibility and recyclability which is significant for centralized disposal after the adsorption and regeneration of the adsorbent 3 2 adsorption removal of hg ii from water 3 2 1 adsorption kinetics kinetic experiments were conducted to explore the hg ii adsorption rate of mos2 fe3o4 as shown in figs 2 a b mos2 fe3o4 decreased the hg ii concentration from 1000 to 10 μg l 1 in 5 min with a 99 removal efficiency and reached adsorption equilibrium in 60 min with a residual hg ii concentration below 2 μg l 1 the pseudo second order model was employed to quantitatively compare the adsorption rate and the kinetic data of hg ii adsorption by the mos2 fe3o4 can be well fitted r2 0 999 suggesting that chemical adsorption plays a major role in the adsorption process li et al 2022d in addition the kinetic constant k 2 was calculated to be 0 38 and 0 56 mg g 1 min 1 for mos2 and mos2 fe3o4 respectively compared with bare mos2 nanosheets the composites exhibited a faster adsorption rate which can be ascribed to the rational design of the hierarchical structure fig s6a shows that various hg ii concentrations e g 100 and 10 000 μg l 1 can also be effectively treated by the adsorbent within 15 min removal efficiency 99 since higher concentrations of hg ii could compete to occupy the limited adsorption active sites mos2 fe3o4 exhibited a faster adsorption rate for 100 μg l 1 of hg ii solution with an increase in the adsorbent dosage the adsorption rate of hg ii by mos2 fe3o4 was further improved fig s6b 3 2 2 adsorption isotherms adsorption isotherm tests were performed to determine the adsorption capacity and elucidate the hg ii adsorption behavior of the adsorbents as depicted in fig 2c the hg ii adsorption capacity of mos2 fe3o4 sharply increases with increasing initial hg ii concentration and then gradually reaches adsorption saturation the langmuir and freundlich models were used to describe the hg ii adsorption process on the adsorbent surface figs 2d and s7 according to the relevant parameters in table s3 the langmuir model can better match the isotherm data of hg ii adsorption by mos2 fe3o4 r2 0 964 indicating that the surface of the adsorbent is dominated by monolayer adsorption fu et al 2022a the theoretical maximum adsorption capacity q m of hg ii by mos2 fe3o4 was calculated to be 1923 5 mg g 1 which exceeds that of a series of mos2 based adsorbents table s5 shahzad et al 2020 song et al 2018a tian et al 2019 xie et al 2018 zhuang et al 2018 although q m of the composites is slightly lower than that of bare mos2 the construction of a hierarchical structure may control the decline in adsorption performance by preventing the agglomeration of external mos2 to a certain extent yang et al 2019 furthermore adopting mos2 fe3o4 nanocomposites can reduce the dosage of mos2 to improve cost effectiveness and advantageously achieve centralized management of hg in practical scenarios the adsorption thermodynamic study was further performed to understand the internal energy change in the adsorption process fig 2e f the thermodynamic parameters were calculated according to the van t hoff equation fu et al 2022a ji et al 2022 including standard gibbs free energy δg enthalpy δh and entropy δs fig s8 and table s4 specifically the negative δg from 17 09 15 c to 19 30 kj mol 1 35 c and positive δh 14 80 kj mol 1 suggest that the hg ii adsorption process by mos2 fe3o4 is spontaneous and endothermic which could be enhanced by improving the reaction temperature moreover the positive δs 110 74 j mol 1 k 1 indicates an increase of the randomness in the adsorption system which may be attributed to the loss of hydrated water from hg ii after adsorption fu et al 2022b 3 3 effect of environmental factors 3 3 1 effect of initial ph to investigate the availability of adsorbents under harsh conditions the effect of solution ph on hg ii adsorption was explored in the ph range of 1 12 fig s9 displays the species distribution of hg ii over the ph range all species were soluble based on the hg ii solubility diagram provided by visual minteq 3 1 approximately 100 of hg ii was efficiently removed by mos2 fe3o4 in the ph range of 2 11 fig 3 a this can be attributed to the dominant chemisorption process combination of s and hg on electroneutral hg ii species which reduces the effect of ph on the adsorption process fu et al 2022a under extremely acidic conditions ph 1 the hg ii removal efficiency of mos2 fe3o4 was slightly decreased maintained at approximately 90 which is related to the more positive charge on the mos2 fe3o4 surface and the large number of competing h fig s10 the above results verify that the as prepared mos2 fe3o4 adsorbent can fulfill the hg ii removal target under broad working ph range 3 3 2 effect of coexisting cations as depicted in fig 3b the anti cation interference ability of the adsorbent was further tested by adding 1 or 10 mg l 1 of individual or mixed metal cations k i na i ca ii mg ii al iii mn ii zn ii cd ii pb ii ni ii and cu ii to 1 mg l 1 hg ii solution the hg ii removal efficiency of mos2 fe3o4 was approximately 100 in the presence of individual interfering cations including hard soft and borderline acid metals even if the above 11 metal cations simultaneously existed in the mixture the removal efficiency of hg ii remained 98 6 according to the lewis acid base theory sulfur interacts strongly with soft acid metals fausey et al 2020 therefore the adsorption selectivity was analyzed by directly comparing the affinity of mos2 fe3o4 toward various soft acid metal cations e g zn ii ni ii cd ii cu ii pb ii and hg ii in particular only the removal efficiency of hg ii was maintained at 99 9 in both the individual and mixed experiments fig 3c which indicates that the mos2 fe3o4 nanocomposites possess a stronger affinity and preferential adsorption behavior toward hg ii as an important parameter for quantifying the selective adsorption performance of the adsorbent the distribution coefficients k d of mos2 fe3o4 for soft acid metal cations were further calculated as shown in fig 3d the k d value of hg ii removal exceeded 1 0 107 mg l 1 which was 2 4 orders of magnitude higher than those for the rest of the soft metal cations moreover it also exceeded those of a series of novel nanomaterial based adsorbents fig 3e and table s5 ding et al 2018 ke et al 2011 liang et al 2016 manos et al 2009 rudd et al 2016 wang et al 2019 including tapb bmttpa cof 7 8 105 ml g 1 huang et al 2017 cocnsp 4 9 106 ml g 1 li et al 2020 mos4 ldh 2 4 106 ml g 1 ma et al 2016 and mos2 rgo 7 5 106 ml g 1 zhuang et al 2018 3 3 3 effect of coexisting anions and dissolved organic matter considering the complexity of a real water environment the effects of typical inorganic anions e g cl so4 2 po4 3 hco3 and dissolved organic matter dom represented by fulvic acid and humic acid on the adsorption process were systematically studied as illustrated in fig s11 the existence of cl so4 2 po4 3 and hco3 in a broad range of concentrations had negligible influence on hg ii removal with a removal efficiency 99 5 in addition the presence of dom exhibited a perceptible impact on hg ii removal when its concentration reached 50 mg l 1 and the removal efficiency was reduced to approximately 90 fig 3f in general the mos2 fe3o4 adsorbent displays excellent anti interference ability indicating its practical applicability in real water matrices 3 4 mechanism of hg ii capture to investigate the mechanism of hg ii adsorption on mos2 fe3o4 a series of characterizations were performed including xrd eds xps tem and raman spectroscopy primarily as shown by the xrd patterns in fig 4 a the change in the 002 plane characteristic peak is related to the decrease in the interlayer spacing of mos2 ai et al 2016 based on the calculation result of the bragg equation the interlayer spacing decreased from 0 96 to 0 65 nm after hg ii adsorption suggesting that hg ii sufficiently diffused to the interior of the mos2 layers to combine with sulfur atoms and then weakened the van der waals force between the s mo s layers the above results are further supported by the hrtem images of hg ii loaded mos2 fe3o4 fig s12b the typical crystal planes of mos2 fe3o4 and the defect rich structure after adsorption are confirmed by the selected area electron diffraction pattern fig s13 which indicates the structural stability of the possible ion diffusion channels and mos2 fe3o4 nanocomposites as revealed by the raman spectra in fig s14 the intensity ratio of a1g and e2g peaks decreases from 1 84 to 1 10 in comparison to the as synthesized mos2 fe3o4 implying the insertion of hg ii after adsorption li et al 2021 subsequently according to the eds mappings in fig s15 partial hg is distributed along the framework of hg ii loaded mos2 fe3o4 in the presence of mo s fe and o xps spectra were obtained to verify the interaction between hg ii and mos2 fe3o4 the wide scan xps spectra fig 4b shows characteristic peaks at 101 and 359 ev after adsorption which are attributed to hg 4f and hg 4d5 respectively fig 4c displays the high resolution hg 4f spectrum in which two new peaks indexed to hg 4f7 2 and hg 4f5 2 are located at binding energies of 101 05 and 105 05 ev respectively which are related to the formation of hg s bonds in surface complexation fu et al 2022a ji et al 2022 in addition a new peak was found at 162 67 ev in the high resolution s 2p spectrum of hg ii loaded mos2 fe3o4 fig 4d further indicating the formation of s hg bonds meanwhile unsaturated sulfur species s2 2 were produced to stabilize the hg atoms on the surface and their peak intensity slightly increased after adsorption zheng et al 2022 as shown in the deconvoluted mo 3d xps spectrum in fig 4e the original mos2 fe3o4 contained 65 1t mos2 compared to 35 2h mos2 and the 1t phase content decreased from 65 to 52 at the end of adsorption this demonstrates that the phase transition of mos2 from 1t to 2h is triggered by the intercalation of hg ii notably the high resolution o 1 s spectrum in fig s16 shows no specific change with the peaks of mo o and fe o occurring after hg ii adsorption only the increased intensity of the ho peak suggesting a negligible interaction between hg ii and o atoms fu et al 2022a a schematic of the hg ii adsorption mechanism by mos2 fe3o4 nanocomposites is shown in fig 5 in brief mos2 fe3o4 is mainly based on the surface complexation of hg s to remove hg ii from water li et al 2022b which may be accompanied by proton exchange of hg ii to release hydrogen atoms ai et al 2016 fu et al 2022b ji et al 2022 the substantial number of sulfur atoms of the enlarged mos2 interlayer in mos2 fe3o4 are significant adsorption active sites for hg ii electrostatic interactions also play a role in the adsorption process because of the negative material surface li et al 2022d in addition the partially conductive 1t phase of mos2 is transformed into the 2h phase which may enhance the transfer of surface charge li et al 2021 eventually the hierarchical microstructure abundant defects and expanded interlayer spacing of mos2 fe3o4 ensure a rapid kinetic process and excellent adsorption capacity for hg ii removal 3 5 practical application potential 3 5 1 regeneration and reusability to confirm the desorption regeneration capacity and structural stability cyclic adsorption desorption experiments were performed in particular the mos2 fe3o4 adsorbent can be easily separated from water by an external magnetic field e g a magnet without high speed centrifugation given the potential danger of a strong acidic reagent ph 1 in realistic scenarios 1 m v thiourea solution prepared with 0 01 mol l 1 hcl was selected to elute the adsorbed hg ii fig 3g shows that the hg ii removal efficiency remained 95 after 10 cycles and was still 90 within consecutive 20 cycles in addition as depicted in figs s12a and s17 the morphology and crystal structure of the reused mos2 fe3o4 hardly changes the alteration of the 002 plane will be discussed in detail in the adsorption mechanism demonstrating the outstanding cycle stability and reusability of mos2 fe3o4 in water treatment 3 5 2 performances in real water matrices the hg ii removal performance of mos2 fe3o4 adsorbent was further evaluated for different water matrices e g natural water and industrial wastewater the concentration level of hg ii in actual contaminated water ranges from 1 to 870 μg l 1 dai et al 2013 richard and biester 2016 song et al 2018b which is significantly higher than that in common surface water groundwater therefore the collected real water samples were spiked with different hg ii concentrations e g 10 100 and 1000 μg l 1 before the adsorption tests for natural water containing a high hg ii concentration 1000 μg l 1 97 of hg ii was effectively removed from tap water groundwater and lake water by mos2 fe3o4 fig 6 a for industrial wastewater with equal hg ii concentrations the hg ii removal efficiencies for desulfurization wastewater dw and cw reached 99 5 using an adsorbent dosage of 0 1 g l 1 fig 6b and all residual hg ii concentrations were particularly low 4 μg l 1 in addition the mos2 fe3o4 adsorbent showed remarkable hg ii removal efficiency 97 at all low concentrations 10 and 100 μg l 1 of hg ii spiked real water samples figs s18 and s19 proving its wide applicability to actual hg contaminated water matrices the amount of mo leached from mos2 fe3o4 for practical applications was further analyzed and a low weight loss 2 of mo was observed after 3 h of adsorption fig s20 this result suggests the relatively good structural stability of the mos2 fe3o4 adsorbent which allows its long term recycling in real water environments to systematically investigate the application potential of the mos2 fe3o4 adsorbent real water samples contaminated with trace amounts of hg ii without spiking were used in the batch adsorption experiments as shown in fig 6c the hg ii removal efficiencies for streams exceed 80 and the residual total hg concentration was lower than the emission limit of the surface water quality standard iii gb3838 2002 china meanwhile 90 of hg ii in desulfurization wastewater was successfully removed by mos2 fe3o4 with an extremely low residual concentration fig 6d which can directly meet the emission requirements of surface water quality standard i consequently the capability to treat various hg ii contaminated waters highlights that mos2 fe3o4 is a promising candidate for the remediation of hg contamination in water 4 conclusions a novel mos2 fe3o4 nanocomposite with a hierarchical structure was synthesized using a facile hydrothermal method which can be readily recycled using an external magnetic field the mos2 fe3o4 had excellent hg ii removal performance with respect to adsorption capacity kinetics selectivity ph application range anti interference ability and reusability the applicability of mos2 fe3o4 in real aquatic environments was verified by its highly effective adsorption of hg ii in various water matrices including natural water and industrial wastewater combining a series of characterization analyses the mechanism of hg ii removal from water by mos2 fe3o4 was elucidated from two aspects the alteration of material structure e g interlayer spacing and phase and the surface coordination of hg s as the reason for the efficient and selective adsorption performance of mos2 fe3o4 overall the recyclable mos2 fe3o4 nanocomposite is a promising adsorbent for the treatment of hg ii in realistic scenarios providing a feasible approach to reduce hg contamination and promote the employment of nano enabled water treatment technologies credit

14897,developing practical and cost effective adsorbents with satisfactory mercury hg remediation capability is indispensable for aquatic environment safety and public health herein a recyclable hierarchical mos2 fe3o4 nanocomposite by in situ growth of mos2 nanosheets on the surface of fe3o4 nanospheres is presented for the selective removal of hg ii from aquatic samples it exhibited high adsorption capacity 1923 5 mg g 1 fast kinetics k 2 0 56 mg g 1 min 1 broad working ph range 2 11 excellent selectivity k d 1 0 107 ml g 1 and great reusability removal efficiency 90 after 20 cycles in particular removal efficiencies of up to 97 for different hg ii concentrations 10 1000 μg l 1 in natural water and industrial effluents confirmed the practicability of mos2 fe3o4 the possible mechanism for effective hg ii removal was discussed by a series of characterization analyses which was attributed to the alteration of the mos2 structure and the surface coordination of hg s the accessibility of surface sulfur sites and the diffusion of hg ii in the solid liquid system were enhanced due to the advantage of the expanded interlayer spacing 0 96 nm and the hierarchical structure this study suggests that mos2 fe3o4 is a promising material for hg ii removal in actual scenarios and provides a feasible approach by rationally constructing hierarchical structures to promote the

mercury hg is a toxic metal that can volatilize into the atmosphere following long distance transboundary transport and deposition on the earth s surface gworek et al 2020 mcnutt 2013 according to the global mercury assessment 2018 unep 2019 the aquatic environment is a significant sink for the global hg cycle in which more than 3000 tons of hg are deposited annually in addition large amounts of hg are released into effluents and sludge through many industrial processes including mining non ferrous metal smelting and textile production resulting in increasing water pollution ji et al 2022 li et al 2022b liu et al 2016 xing et al 2022 although the hg concentration in water is generally low its concentration in organisms can be biomagnified 106 7 times bravo et al 2014 which poses global environmental and health risks inorganic divalent hg hg ii is the main hg species in water environments ni chadhain et al 2006 and long term chronic hg ii exposure can adversely damage organs e g the kidney and liver clifton 2007 zahir et al 2005 owing to the complexity of the water environment conventional methods such as chemical precipitation coagulation and electrolysis are still inefficient for hg ii removal li et al 2022a vikrant and kim 2019 therefore it is imperative to develop advanced wastewater treatment techniques for hg ii removal chen et al 2022 lavoie et al 2013 various treatment technologies have been used to remove toxic contaminants from wastewater including ion exchange siva et al 2015 adsorption ai et al 2016 hong et al 2022 membrane separation bruno et al 2021 electrochemical treatment kim et al 2018 tunsu and wickman 2018 advanced oxidation processes khiem et al 2023a khiem et al 2023b liu et al 2023 and bioremediation franco et al 2018 among these methods adsorption is regarded as promising for large scale applications owing to its cost effectiveness operational flexibility and reusability ji et al 2021 however traditional adsorbents such as activated carbon zeolites mesoporous silica and resins suffer from slow kinetics low adsorption capacity and poor regeneration ability and selectivity which limit their application in the remediation of hg contamination lu and astruc 2018 recently several classes of nanomaterials have been explored as next generation hg ii adsorbents in water including mesoporous carbons metal organic frameworks mofs and covalent organic frameworks cofs nevertheless most materials face problems of complicated synthesis steps and expensive raw materials huang et al 2017 mon et al 2016 shin et al 2007 sun et al 2017 yee et al 2013 the preparation of mesoporous carbon is inevitable to use strong acid reagents shin et al 2007 and sulfur functionalized mofs typically require relatively expensive ligands mon et al 2016 yee et al 2013 in addition thiol modified cofs efficiently decreased the hg ii concentration in water however their synthesis time and cost need to be further controlled huang et al 2017 sun et al 2017 thus the design of highly efficient and cost effective adsorbents for hg ii immobilization is of great significance as a typical two dimensional transition metal dichalcogenide material molybdenum disulfide mos2 exhibits unique photoelectric characteristics and excellent adsorption catalysis activity which leads to its wide application in energy storage and environmental remediation ishag and sun 2021 wang and mi 2017 according to the lewis acid base theory soft basic sulfur has a strong affinity toward the soft acid hg which makes mos2 with abundant sulfur atoms a potential candidate for efficient hg ii adsorbents jia et al 2018 jia et al 2017 subbaiah et al 2021 however the adsorption performance of mos2 is inevitably limited due to the inadequate layer spacing interlayer stacking and agglomerate kumar et al 2019 wang et al 2020 in addition the synthesis of mos2 is relatively expensive and the formation of hg containing wastes may cause secondary pollution jiang et al 2023a li et al 2022b thus it is still challenging to overcome these drawbacks to obtain recyclable and cost effective mos2 adsorbents with highly exposed surface sulfur atoms for water purification jiang et al 2023b li et al 2022e yang et al 2020 given the paramagnetic and earth abundant properties of fe3o4 ahmad et al 2020 wan et al 2021 it could be combined with mos2 to form hierarchical composites and act as an isolator to inhibit the agglomeration of mos2 and improve the accessibility of active sites li et al 2022c zhang et al 2017 herein a hierarchical mos2 fe3o4 nanocomposite was constructed by in situ growth of mos2 nanosheets on the surface of fe3o4 nanospheres using a hydrothermal method to efficiently and selectively remove hg ii from water the alterations of structure and surface chemical environment on mos2 fe3o4 after adsorption were analyzed by various characterizations to explore the mechanism of hg ii capture the hg ii removal performance of mos2 fe3o4 was optimized in terms of adsorption capacity working ph range adsorption kinetics anti interference capability and reusability and was effectively applied to hg ii removal in natural water and power plant wastewater based on the design of structure and composition this study provides a novel and efficient adsorbent for hg ii removal in actual scenarios promoting real applications of mos2 based materials in water purification 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of hierarchical mos2 fe3o4 nanocomposites fe3o4 nanospheres were prepared using a typical solvothermal method according to the literature deng et al 2005 briefly 1 35 g 5 mmol of fecl3 6h2o was dissolved in 35 ml of ethylene glycol followed by the addition of 3 6 g of c2h3o2na 3h2o and 1 0 g of poly ethylene glycol after stirring for 30 min until the solid was completely dissolved the mixture was transferred into a 50 ml teflon lined stainless steel autoclave which was then maintained at 200 c for 8 h the product was magnetically collected washed several times with deionized water diw and ethanol and then dried at 60 c under vacuum for further utilization hierarchical mos2 fe3o4 nanocomposites were prepared using a hydrothermal method in detail 1 24 g 1 mmol of nh4 6mo7o24 4h2o and 2 28 g 30 mmol of thiourea were dissolved in 35 ml of diw which was then added to 50 mg of as synthesized fe3o4 nanospheres the above mixture was processed via ultrasonication for 10 min to disperse well and then transferred into a 50 ml teflon lined stainless steel autoclave which was maintained at 180 c for 20 h the product was centrifuged and washed several times with diw and ethanol and then dried at 60 c under vacuum to obtain the final mos2 fe3o4 nanocomposites for comparison bare mos2 nanosheets were also prepared without fe3o4 nanospheres all the chemicals and detailed information on the characterization utilized in this study are provided in the supporting information 2 2 adsorption experiments the hg ii stock solution 50 mg l 1 was prepared by diluting the hg standard solution hgcl2 1000 mg l 1 in diw then hg ii solutions with various initial concentrations were prepared by diluting the stock solution or standard solution the adsorption kinetics were studied at different hg ii concentrations 0 1 1 and 10 mg l 1 the adsorption isotherms were determined in the range of hg ii concentrations from 10 to 400 mg l 1 after 12 h of adsorption at 15 25 and 35 c the initial ph of the hg ii solution was adjusted using hcl or naoh 0 1 mol l 1 for the desorption regeneration tests the mos2 fe3o4 after hg ii adsorption was eluted with a 1 m v thiourea solution containing 0 01 mol l 1 hcl batch experiments were conducted by adding 10 mg adsorbents to 250 ml quartz beakers containing 100 ml reaction solution at room temperature 25 c unless specified otherwise continuous oscillation 180 rpm was maintained in a shaker to reduce the mass transfer resistance during adsorption the specific operation conditions e g ph initial hg ii concentration and solution volume of the adsorption experiments are shown in each figure the reaction solutions were sampled at predetermined time intervals and all samples were filtered with polyether sulfone syringe filters 0 22 μm before analyzing the residual heavy metal concentrations 2 3 sample collection adsorption experiments for hg ii removal were performed in natural water and industrial wastewater matrices using mos2 fe3o4 nanocomposites samples of natural water tap water lake water taihu lake southeast china and groundwater jiangsu southeast china were collected separately in addition stream water near an abandoned hg mine shaanxi northwest china was collected from five locations for industrial wastewater the influent before desulfurization dw and effluent after desulfurization cw were sampled at six locations at a coal fired power plant hebei north china after collection all water samples were filtered with a polyether sulfone membrane 0 45 μm and stored at 20 c different concentrations 10 100 and 1000 μg l 1 of hg ii spiked solutions were prepared by adding hg ii stock solution to the above samples before the adsorption experiment 2 4 analytical methods the concentrations of hg ii and other metal cations were measured using an automated total mercury analytical system following the usepa method 1631 or inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer all the experimental data were the averages of three replicate experiments with the standard deviation indicated by error bars adsorption kinetics were described using a pseudo second order kinetic model the equilibrium adsorption isotherms were fitted using the langmuir and freundlich models all the details of the adsorption kinetics and adsorption isotherm model fittings can be found in the supporting information 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of hierarchical mos2 fe3o4 the synthesis process of the hierarchical mos2 fe3o4 nanocomposites is illustrated in fig 1 a in which mos2 nanosheets were directly grown on fe3o4 nanospheres through a one step hydrothermal method insufficient sulfidation of the molybdenum precursor introduces structural defects and enlarged interlayer spacing into the mos2 nanosheets due to the controlled temperature of the hydrothermal reaction li et al 2021 the existence of excess nh4 produced by thiourea can weaken the van der waals forces between the mos2 molecular layers which expands the 002 plane spacing in addition the formation energy of the metallic 1t phase is reduced by nh4 to promote the production of the 1t 2h mixed phase in mos2 chen et al 2019 scanning electron microscopy sem fig 1b and transmission electron microscopy tem fig 1c images show that the mos2 nanosheets in mos2 fe3o4 were vertically aligned on the surface of the fe3o4 nanospheres compared with the bare mos2 nanosheets fig s1 this three dimensional microstructure is beneficial for inhibiting the stacking of neighboring mos2 layers and enhancing mass transfer in the adsorption process as seen from the high resolution tem hrtem images fig 1d the expanded interlayer spacing of mos2 in the nanocomposites was measured to 0 96 nm typically 0 62 nm wang and mi 2017 which is favorable for the diffusion of hg ii in adjacent mos2 layers in addition the interrupted lattice fringes were widely dispersed on the 002 plane of mos2 indicating the formation of structural defects that could be used as ion diffusion channels the tem energy dispersive spectroscopy eds images in fig 1e confirm that mo s fe and o were homogeneously distributed along the mos2 fe3o4 nanocomposites and the mos2 nanosheets were intercalated into the surface of the fe3o4 nanospheres to form a hierarchical structure the x ray diffraction xrd pattern in fig 1f indicates that the characteristic peaks of mos2 fe3o4 match well with the data for the as prepared fe3o4 and bare mos2 two strong diffraction peaks emerged at 2θ 9 2 and 18 4 which correspond to the 002 and 004 planes of the intercalated mos2 respectively according to the calculation results of the bragg equation the interlayer distance of mos2 nanosheets in the mos2 fe3o4 nanocomposites was enlarged significantly to 0 96 nm which agreed well with the tem analysis results the raman spectra of bare mos2 nanosheets figs 1g and s2 show that the characteristic signals at 383 and 407 cm 1 are attributed to two main acoustic phonon modes e2g and a1g of typical 2h phase mos2 after integration with fe3o4 several strong peaks appeared at 239 284 339 and 407 cm 1 which are indexed to j2 e1g j3 and a1g of the 1t phase mos2 respectively this reveals that the mos2 in the mos2 fe3o4 nanocomposites comprises 1t and 2h phases luo et al 2019 to quantify the proportion of different phases in mos2 x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps was employed to identify the element composition and atomic structure fig s3a the high resolution xps spectra of mo 3d and s 2p in figs s3b and s3d illustrate that all the characteristic peaks of mos2 fe3o4 are slightly shifted toward a lower binding energy compared with the bare mos2 according to the deconvolution calculation of the xps fitting results table s1 the 1t phase content in mos2 is estimated to increase from 55 to 65 after integration the abundant metallic 1t phase of mos2 in mos2 fe3o4 nanocomposites can accelerate interfacial charge transfer dai et al 2021 li et al 2021 which facilitates the combination of positive hg ii and negative sulfur on the material surface in addition the characteristic peaks of o 1 s at 531 05 and 531 95 ev are attributed to the existence of fe o and mo o bonds between mos2 and fe3o4 fig s3c respectively implying that the composites are combined by chemical bonds rather than just physical blending benefiting from the introduction of fe3o4 the composites showed stronger hydrophobicity than the bare mos2 as demonstrated in water contact angle tests fig s4 this indicates that inorganic ions are more accessible and contributes to better adsorption performance qie et al 2022 as shown in fig s5 and table s2 the brunauer emmett teller surface area of mos2 fe3o4 20 6 m2 g 1 is slightly lower than that of bare mos2 24 6 m2 g 1 and the average pore size decreases from 19 4 to 18 5 nm due to the combination of the two components magnetic characterization measured by a vibrating sample magnetometer at 300 k demonstrated that the mos2 fe3o4 nanocomposites exhibited superparamagnetic properties little remanence and coercivity due to the introduction of ultrafine magnetite nanoparticles fig 1h the decrease in the saturated magnetization value of mos2 fe3o4 in comparison with that of fe3o4 provides further evidence that the surface of the fe3o4 nanospheres is covered by mos2 nanosheets the mos2 fe3o4 nanocomposites were well dispersed in water to form a black suspension through vigorous shaking by applying an external magnetic field the composites can be rapidly separated from the solution these results verify that mos2 fe3o4 possesses excellent dispersibility and recyclability which is significant for centralized disposal after the adsorption and regeneration of the adsorbent 3 2 adsorption removal of hg ii from water 3 2 1 adsorption kinetics kinetic experiments were conducted to explore the hg ii adsorption rate of mos2 fe3o4 as shown in figs 2 a b mos2 fe3o4 decreased the hg ii concentration from 1000 to 10 μg l 1 in 5 min with a 99 removal efficiency and reached adsorption equilibrium in 60 min with a residual hg ii concentration below 2 μg l 1 the pseudo second order model was employed to quantitatively compare the adsorption rate and the kinetic data of hg ii adsorption by the mos2 fe3o4 can be well fitted r2 0 999 suggesting that chemical adsorption plays a major role in the adsorption process li et al 2022d in addition the kinetic constant k 2 was calculated to be 0 38 and 0 56 mg g 1 min 1 for mos2 and mos2 fe3o4 respectively compared with bare mos2 nanosheets the composites exhibited a faster adsorption rate which can be ascribed to the rational design of the hierarchical structure fig s6a shows that various hg ii concentrations e g 100 and 10 000 μg l 1 can also be effectively treated by the adsorbent within 15 min removal efficiency 99 since higher concentrations of hg ii could compete to occupy the limited adsorption active sites mos2 fe3o4 exhibited a faster adsorption rate for 100 μg l 1 of hg ii solution with an increase in the adsorbent dosage the adsorption rate of hg ii by mos2 fe3o4 was further improved fig s6b 3 2 2 adsorption isotherms adsorption isotherm tests were performed to determine the adsorption capacity and elucidate the hg ii adsorption behavior of the adsorbents as depicted in fig 2c the hg ii adsorption capacity of mos2 fe3o4 sharply increases with increasing initial hg ii concentration and then gradually reaches adsorption saturation the langmuir and freundlich models were used to describe the hg ii adsorption process on the adsorbent surface figs 2d and s7 according to the relevant parameters in table s3 the langmuir model can better match the isotherm data of hg ii adsorption by mos2 fe3o4 r2 0 964 indicating that the surface of the adsorbent is dominated by monolayer adsorption fu et al 2022a the theoretical maximum adsorption capacity q m of hg ii by mos2 fe3o4 was calculated to be 1923 5 mg g 1 which exceeds that of a series of mos2 based adsorbents table s5 shahzad et al 2020 song et al 2018a tian et al 2019 xie et al 2018 zhuang et al 2018 although q m of the composites is slightly lower than that of bare mos2 the construction of a hierarchical structure may control the decline in adsorption performance by preventing the agglomeration of external mos2 to a certain extent yang et al 2019 furthermore adopting mos2 fe3o4 nanocomposites can reduce the dosage of mos2 to improve cost effectiveness and advantageously achieve centralized management of hg in practical scenarios the adsorption thermodynamic study was further performed to understand the internal energy change in the adsorption process fig 2e f the thermodynamic parameters were calculated according to the van t hoff equation fu et al 2022a ji et al 2022 including standard gibbs free energy δg enthalpy δh and entropy δs fig s8 and table s4 specifically the negative δg from 17 09 15 c to 19 30 kj mol 1 35 c and positive δh 14 80 kj mol 1 suggest that the hg ii adsorption process by mos2 fe3o4 is spontaneous and endothermic which could be enhanced by improving the reaction temperature moreover the positive δs 110 74 j mol 1 k 1 indicates an increase of the randomness in the adsorption system which may be attributed to the loss of hydrated water from hg ii after adsorption fu et al 2022b 3 3 effect of environmental factors 3 3 1 effect of initial ph to investigate the availability of adsorbents under harsh conditions the effect of solution ph on hg ii adsorption was explored in the ph range of 1 12 fig s9 displays the species distribution of hg ii over the ph range all species were soluble based on the hg ii solubility diagram provided by visual minteq 3 1 approximately 100 of hg ii was efficiently removed by mos2 fe3o4 in the ph range of 2 11 fig 3 a this can be attributed to the dominant chemisorption process combination of s and hg on electroneutral hg ii species which reduces the effect of ph on the adsorption process fu et al 2022a under extremely acidic conditions ph 1 the hg ii removal efficiency of mos2 fe3o4 was slightly decreased maintained at approximately 90 which is related to the more positive charge on the mos2 fe3o4 surface and the large number of competing h fig s10 the above results verify that the as prepared mos2 fe3o4 adsorbent can fulfill the hg ii removal target under broad working ph range 3 3 2 effect of coexisting cations as depicted in fig 3b the anti cation interference ability of the adsorbent was further tested by adding 1 or 10 mg l 1 of individual or mixed metal cations k i na i ca ii mg ii al iii mn ii zn ii cd ii pb ii ni ii and cu ii to 1 mg l 1 hg ii solution the hg ii removal efficiency of mos2 fe3o4 was approximately 100 in the presence of individual interfering cations including hard soft and borderline acid metals even if the above 11 metal cations simultaneously existed in the mixture the removal efficiency of hg ii remained 98 6 according to the lewis acid base theory sulfur interacts strongly with soft acid metals fausey et al 2020 therefore the adsorption selectivity was analyzed by directly comparing the affinity of mos2 fe3o4 toward various soft acid metal cations e g zn ii ni ii cd ii cu ii pb ii and hg ii in particular only the removal efficiency of hg ii was maintained at 99 9 in both the individual and mixed experiments fig 3c which indicates that the mos2 fe3o4 nanocomposites possess a stronger affinity and preferential adsorption behavior toward hg ii as an important parameter for quantifying the selective adsorption performance of the adsorbent the distribution coefficients k d of mos2 fe3o4 for soft acid metal cations were further calculated as shown in fig 3d the k d value of hg ii removal exceeded 1 0 107 mg l 1 which was 2 4 orders of magnitude higher than those for the rest of the soft metal cations moreover it also exceeded those of a series of novel nanomaterial based adsorbents fig 3e and table s5 ding et al 2018 ke et al 2011 liang et al 2016 manos et al 2009 rudd et al 2016 wang et al 2019 including tapb bmttpa cof 7 8 105 ml g 1 huang et al 2017 cocnsp 4 9 106 ml g 1 li et al 2020 mos4 ldh 2 4 106 ml g 1 ma et al 2016 and mos2 rgo 7 5 106 ml g 1 zhuang et al 2018 3 3 3 effect of coexisting anions and dissolved organic matter considering the complexity of a real water environment the effects of typical inorganic anions e g cl so4 2 po4 3 hco3 and dissolved organic matter dom represented by fulvic acid and humic acid on the adsorption process were systematically studied as illustrated in fig s11 the existence of cl so4 2 po4 3 and hco3 in a broad range of concentrations had negligible influence on hg ii removal with a removal efficiency 99 5 in addition the presence of dom exhibited a perceptible impact on hg ii removal when its concentration reached 50 mg l 1 and the removal efficiency was reduced to approximately 90 fig 3f in general the mos2 fe3o4 adsorbent displays excellent anti interference ability indicating its practical applicability in real water matrices 3 4 mechanism of hg ii capture to investigate the mechanism of hg ii adsorption on mos2 fe3o4 a series of characterizations were performed including xrd eds xps tem and raman spectroscopy primarily as shown by the xrd patterns in fig 4 a the change in the 002 plane characteristic peak is related to the decrease in the interlayer spacing of mos2 ai et al 2016 based on the calculation result of the bragg equation the interlayer spacing decreased from 0 96 to 0 65 nm after hg ii adsorption suggesting that hg ii sufficiently diffused to the interior of the mos2 layers to combine with sulfur atoms and then weakened the van der waals force between the s mo s layers the above results are further supported by the hrtem images of hg ii loaded mos2 fe3o4 fig s12b the typical crystal planes of mos2 fe3o4 and the defect rich structure after adsorption are confirmed by the selected area electron diffraction pattern fig s13 which indicates the structural stability of the possible ion diffusion channels and mos2 fe3o4 nanocomposites as revealed by the raman spectra in fig s14 the intensity ratio of a1g and e2g peaks decreases from 1 84 to 1 10 in comparison to the as synthesized mos2 fe3o4 implying the insertion of hg ii after adsorption li et al 2021 subsequently according to the eds mappings in fig s15 partial hg is distributed along the framework of hg ii loaded mos2 fe3o4 in the presence of mo s fe and o xps spectra were obtained to verify the interaction between hg ii and mos2 fe3o4 the wide scan xps spectra fig 4b shows characteristic peaks at 101 and 359 ev after adsorption which are attributed to hg 4f and hg 4d5 respectively fig 4c displays the high resolution hg 4f spectrum in which two new peaks indexed to hg 4f7 2 and hg 4f5 2 are located at binding energies of 101 05 and 105 05 ev respectively which are related to the formation of hg s bonds in surface complexation fu et al 2022a ji et al 2022 in addition a new peak was found at 162 67 ev in the high resolution s 2p spectrum of hg ii loaded mos2 fe3o4 fig 4d further indicating the formation of s hg bonds meanwhile unsaturated sulfur species s2 2 were produced to stabilize the hg atoms on the surface and their peak intensity slightly increased after adsorption zheng et al 2022 as shown in the deconvoluted mo 3d xps spectrum in fig 4e the original mos2 fe3o4 contained 65 1t mos2 compared to 35 2h mos2 and the 1t phase content decreased from 65 to 52 at the end of adsorption this demonstrates that the phase transition of mos2 from 1t to 2h is triggered by the intercalation of hg ii notably the high resolution o 1 s spectrum in fig s16 shows no specific change with the peaks of mo o and fe o occurring after hg ii adsorption only the increased intensity of the ho peak suggesting a negligible interaction between hg ii and o atoms fu et al 2022a a schematic of the hg ii adsorption mechanism by mos2 fe3o4 nanocomposites is shown in fig 5 in brief mos2 fe3o4 is mainly based on the surface complexation of hg s to remove hg ii from water li et al 2022b which may be accompanied by proton exchange of hg ii to release hydrogen atoms ai et al 2016 fu et al 2022b ji et al 2022 the substantial number of sulfur atoms of the enlarged mos2 interlayer in mos2 fe3o4 are significant adsorption active sites for hg ii electrostatic interactions also play a role in the adsorption process because of the negative material surface li et al 2022d in addition the partially conductive 1t phase of mos2 is transformed into the 2h phase which may enhance the transfer of surface charge li et al 2021 eventually the hierarchical microstructure abundant defects and expanded interlayer spacing of mos2 fe3o4 ensure a rapid kinetic process and excellent adsorption capacity for hg ii removal 3 5 practical application potential 3 5 1 regeneration and reusability to confirm the desorption regeneration capacity and structural stability cyclic adsorption desorption experiments were performed in particular the mos2 fe3o4 adsorbent can be easily separated from water by an external magnetic field e g a magnet without high speed centrifugation given the potential danger of a strong acidic reagent ph 1 in realistic scenarios 1 m v thiourea solution prepared with 0 01 mol l 1 hcl was selected to elute the adsorbed hg ii fig 3g shows that the hg ii removal efficiency remained 95 after 10 cycles and was still 90 within consecutive 20 cycles in addition as depicted in figs s12a and s17 the morphology and crystal structure of the reused mos2 fe3o4 hardly changes the alteration of the 002 plane will be discussed in detail in the adsorption mechanism demonstrating the outstanding cycle stability and reusability of mos2 fe3o4 in water treatment 3 5 2 performances in real water matrices the hg ii removal performance of mos2 fe3o4 adsorbent was further evaluated for different water matrices e g natural water and industrial wastewater the concentration level of hg ii in actual contaminated water ranges from 1 to 870 μg l 1 dai et al 2013 richard and biester 2016 song et al 2018b which is significantly higher than that in common surface water groundwater therefore the collected real water samples were spiked with different hg ii concentrations e g 10 100 and 1000 μg l 1 before the adsorption tests for natural water containing a high hg ii concentration 1000 μg l 1 97 of hg ii was effectively removed from tap water groundwater and lake water by mos2 fe3o4 fig 6 a for industrial wastewater with equal hg ii concentrations the hg ii removal efficiencies for desulfurization wastewater dw and cw reached 99 5 using an adsorbent dosage of 0 1 g l 1 fig 6b and all residual hg ii concentrations were particularly low 4 μg l 1 in addition the mos2 fe3o4 adsorbent showed remarkable hg ii removal efficiency 97 at all low concentrations 10 and 100 μg l 1 of hg ii spiked real water samples figs s18 and s19 proving its wide applicability to actual hg contaminated water matrices the amount of mo leached from mos2 fe3o4 for practical applications was further analyzed and a low weight loss 2 of mo was observed after 3 h of adsorption fig s20 this result suggests the relatively good structural stability of the mos2 fe3o4 adsorbent which allows its long term recycling in real water environments to systematically investigate the application potential of the mos2 fe3o4 adsorbent real water samples contaminated with trace amounts of hg ii without spiking were used in the batch adsorption experiments as shown in fig 6c the hg ii removal efficiencies for streams exceed 80 and the residual total hg concentration was lower than the emission limit of the surface water quality standard iii gb3838 2002 china meanwhile 90 of hg ii in desulfurization wastewater was successfully removed by mos2 fe3o4 with an extremely low residual concentration fig 6d which can directly meet the emission requirements of surface water quality standard i consequently the capability to treat various hg ii contaminated waters highlights that mos2 fe3o4 is a promising candidate for the remediation of hg contamination in water 4 conclusions a novel mos2 fe3o4 nanocomposite with a hierarchical structure was synthesized using a facile hydrothermal method which can be readily recycled using an external magnetic field the mos2 fe3o4 had excellent hg ii removal performance with respect to adsorption capacity kinetics selectivity ph application range anti interference ability and reusability the applicability of mos2 fe3o4 in real aquatic environments was verified by its highly effective adsorption of hg ii in various water matrices including natural water and industrial wastewater combining a series of characterization analyses the mechanism of hg ii removal from water by mos2 fe3o4 was elucidated from two aspects the alteration of material structure e g interlayer spacing and phase and the surface coordination of hg s as the reason for the efficient and selective adsorption performance of mos2 fe3o4 overall the recyclable mos2 fe3o4 nanocomposite is a promising adsorbent for the treatment of hg ii in realistic scenarios providing a feasible approach to reduce hg contamination and promote the employment of nano enabled water treatment technologies credit

14898,microbial driven nitrogen removal is a crucial step in modern full scale wastewater treatment plants wwtps and the complexity of nitrogen transformation is integral to the various wastewater treatment processes a full understanding of the overall nitrogen cycling networks in wwtps is therefore a prerequisite for the further enhancement and optimization of wastewater treatment processes in this study metagenomics and metatranscriptomics were used to elucidate the microbial nitrogen removal processes in an ammonium enriched full scale wwtp which was configured as an anaerobic anoxic anaerobic oxic system for efficient nitrogen removal 99 63 on a duck breeding farm a typical simultaneous nitrification anammox denitrification snad process was established in each tank of this wwtp ammonia was oxidized by ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob archaea aoa and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob and the produced nitrite and nitrate were further reduced to dinitrogen gas n2 by anammox and denitrifying bacteria visible red anammox biofilms were formed successfully on the sponge carriers submerged in the anoxic tank and the nitrogen removal rate by anammox reaction was 4 85 times higher than that by denitrification based on 15n isotope labeling and analysis this supports the significant accumulation of anammox bacteria on the carriers responsible for efficient nitrogen removal two distinct anammox bacteria named ca brocadia sp pf01 and ca jettenia sp pf02 were identified from the biofilm in this investigation by recovering their genomic features and their metabolic capabilities our results indicate that the highly active core anammox process found in pf01 suggests extending its niche within the plant with the possible contribution of the dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra reaction enriching pf02 within the biofilm may also be warranted collectively this study highlights the effective design strategies of a full scale wwtp with enrichment of anammox bacteria on the carrier materials for nitrogen removal and therefore the biochemical reaction mechanisms of the contributing members graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nitrogen cycle snad 15n isotope labeling biofilm anammox data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction full scale wastewater treatment plants wwtps are effective means for treating nitrogen containing wastewaters including municipal wastewater industrial wastewater and livestock wastewater alhassan et al 2020 various wastewater treatment processes are in operation including the a o anoxic oxic process the a2 o anaerobic anoxic oxic process the sequencing batch reactor sbr the activated sludge process and the biofilm process chen et al 2019 nie et al 2012 sonune and ghate 2004 the complex microbial community driven by sophisticated nitrogen cycling networks in wwtp is effective for nitrogen removal in the conventional wastewater treatment process ammonium nh4 is finally converted to nitrogen gas n2 through a combination of nitrification and denitrification processes however obstacles such as oxygen and external nutrient supply high energy consumption and excessive sludge production can prevent achievement of high operation efficiency liu et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 the process of anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox is an autotrophic metabolism that combines nh4 and nitrite no2 directly into n2 providing a shortcut strategy for nitrogen removal the anammox reaction is also regarded as a cost effective and sustainable nitrogen removal approach to replace the energy intensive conventional treatment processes kuenen 2008 weralupitiya et al 2021 several configurations containing anammox reactions are available in wastewater treatment e g partial nitrification anammox pn amx partial denitrification anammox pd amx simultaneous nitrification anammox and denitrification snad and partial nitrification anammox and methane dependent nitrite nitrate reduction pnam liu et al 2021 zhuang et al 2022 for instance pn amx shows optimal performance in treating ammonia rich wastewater with a strict ratio of 0 5 for chemical oxygen demand cod to nitrogen in the water daigger 2014 kang et al 2018 lackner et al 2014 biodegradable cod ubiquitous in wastewater with a high c n ratio henze et al 2008 lackner et al 2014 will deteriorate the stable operation of the pn amx system alternatively denitrification can be integrated into the system of pd amx and snad for an effective treatment with a wider range of cod concentrations liu et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 zhuang et al 2022 ammonium is readily available in wastewater but a stable and adequate no2 supply becomes the key factor for efficient application of anammox based processes zhang et al 2019 however pd amx and snad anammox reactions may be blocked under conditions that favor no2 utilizing nob as competitors or denitrifying bacteria thriving under sufficient cod supply jenni et al 2014 xu et al 2015 zhang et al 2019 zhuang et al 2022 most recently a distinct technology pnam has been developed and applied in a single membrane biofilm reactor mbfr to address this problem in such a system nob compete for available nitrite with anammox and nitrite nitrate dependent anaerobic methane oxidation n damo bacteria or archaea growth of n damo microorganisms can be accelerated by introducing methane resulting in lack of the nitrite for nob growth liu et al 2021 even though efficiency of nitrogen removal can be gradually improved and be cost effective it is important to understand the nitrogen cycling pathways and the active microorganisms to better improve the wastewater treatment processe the anammox reaction is a promising nitrogen removal pathway for sustainable removal of both no2 and nh4 by direct autotrophic coupling however anammox bacteria grow slowly and are very sensitive to the harsh environmental conditions of wwtps kuenen 2008 li et al 2021 zhuang et al 2022 from reported results porous carriers can create a favorable micro environment for the survival and enrichment of anammox bacteria thereby increase their biomass li et al 2021 yang et al 2021a 2020 this in turn provides a practical way to stimulate anammox in wwtps in addition the centrality of the anammox reaction in the overall metabolism of nitrogen has been analyzed and the feasibility of inoculation of a high density of anammox bacterial aggregates in sludge into full scale wwtps has been confirmed yang et al 2020 although a straightforward and effective strategy would be to utilize anammox bacterial biomass for inoculation it is very time consuming to produce large quantities of this biomass and there is no guarantee that the inoculation will be successful however visible red granules of anammox bacteria can be observed occasionally in full scale operating wwtps meng et al 2017 and such anammox enriched sludge can be an effective inoculation to establish more anammox processes in additional wwpts comparing two typical carrier material types microporous and macroporous carriers in full scale pn amx reactors anammox enriched biofilms were established on both of them but thicker biofilms and stronger denitrification efficiency were found on the microporous carriers yang et al 2021a recently li et al revealed that the abundance of anammox bacteria on the carrier was mostly influenced by suspended biomass which relieve the pressure from toxicity and inhibition by no2 li et al 2021 recently a granular activated carbon gac anammox biofilm combined with two activated sludge systems was constructed for treating landfill leachate and a new anammox genus ca loosdrechtia was identified yang et al 2021b 2022 in summary utilization of biofilm carriers is a workable strategy for anammox enrichment and nitrogen removal in wastewater treatment processes but most results are currently based on laboratory level bioreactors li et al 2021 zhuang et al 2022 or inoculation of high density anammox bacteria into the full scale wwtps meng et al 2017 yang et al 2020 yang et al 2021 mechanisms contributing to the natural enrichment of anammox bacteria attached to carrier materials in full scale wwtps have not been fully elucidated in this study a high ammonium removal efficiency 99 63 cascading system achieved through the interactions of different microbial groups active in a full scale wwtp was investigated the plant was equipped with a typical continuous anaerobic anoxic anaerobic oxic process for the treatment of cod and ammonium rich duck breeding wastewater additionally anammox bacteria that were naturally enriched in porous material played a significant role in the nitrogen transformation process the objectives of this study were to i understand the underlying mechanisms of high efficiency nitrogen removal through an in depth analysis of the technological characteristics of the targeted wwtp ii construct the complex nitrogen metabolic networks in different wastewater treatment reactors stages based on an in situ metatranscriptomics study and further explain the mechanism of efficient nitrogen removal at the microbial level iii reveal the underlying environmental factors nh4 n and no2 n concentrations ion concentrations and metabolic characteristics that contribute to the natural enrichment of anammox bacteria in the carrier biofilms metagenomics and metatranscriptomics approaches were used to study the microbial communities and activities responsible for nitrogen removal the contributions of anammox and denitrification on nitrogen removal in carrier biofilms were further quantified by the 15n isotope amendment and incubation analysis the overall nitrogen transformation pathways in different stage reactors and biofilms were described by the transcriptional levels of relevant genes the central metabolism by anammox bacteria for nitrogen removal was evaluated with the gene content of reconstructed genomes metatranscriptome and n 15 data 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling nucleic acid extraction and sequencing a full scale wwtp located in guangzhou guangdong province china was designed to treat cod and ammonium rich duck breeding wastewater the full scale wwtp has been operated as a conventional activated sludge system consisting of a primary treatment tank anaerobic 1 a anoxic 1 o 192 m3 of each tank and a second treatment tank anaerobic 2 a oxic 2 o 216 m3 of each tank fig 1 the primary anoxic tank 1 o was divided into two parts y a and y b and polyurethane sponge carriers were introduced to promote the growth of anammox bacteria into visible red granules the effluent wastewater from anoxic tank y b was returned back to anaerobic tank 1 a with an approximate flow of 20 25 m3 h and the effluent wastewater from oxic tank 2 o was pumped back to anaerobic tank 2 a and 1 a with an inflow rate of 10 15 m3 h fig 1 before sampling the wwtp had been operated with the breeding farm wastewater for more than one year some basic parameters including chemical oxygen demand cod salinity hydraulic retention time hrt ph and the concentrate of ammonium nitrite nitrate are analyzed and presented fig 1 table s1 wastewater in the system maintained a flow rate of 13 m3 h resulting in a retention time of 10 14 h in the primary tank 1 a 1 o and 12 16 h in the second tank 2 a 2 o the operating temperature of all tanks in the plant was kept at around 34 c and the ph value was maintained at approximately 8 0 samples in this study were collected from this wwtp in june 2021 for an investigation of nitrogen removal efficiency and the microbial driven nitrogen transformation network fresh activated sludge samples were obtained from anaerobic tank 1 a anoxic tank y a and y b anaerobic tank 2 a and oxic tank 2 o and biofilm samples were collected from the sponge carriers in the two parts of the anoxic tank y a and y b samples were preserved on site after collection in lifeguard soil preservation qiagen shanghai for dna and rna extraction the procedures used for dna and rna extraction were those provided in the kit handbooks qiagen shanghai shotgun metagenomic

nitrogen cycle construction and anammox bacterial mags annotation predicted orfs from scaffolds were analyzed by blastp searches against a custom nitrogen cycle database with the requirements of e value 10e 10 amino acid identities 60 and a minimum alignment length 50 afterward the overall nitrogen cycles in each reactor or biofilm were constructed based on the transcriptional levels of different nitrogen cycle related genes to improve the quality of obtained anammox bacteria mags re assembling was carried out using the previously described protocol yang et al 2020a yang et al 2021 briefly two anammox bacteria mags were mapped onto the clean reads using bbmap bushnell 2014 and the successfully aligned reads were re assembled using spades v3 12 0 bankevich et al 2012 with the k

cepas et al 2016 and against the ncbi non redundant nr database by blastp to compare the genome wide gene expression level of the two anammox mags in each reactor or biofilm gene transcription showed by tpm was standardized by the genome abundance 2 4 phylogenetic and comparative genome analyses the alignment of 43 concatenated markers of all retained mags produced by check m v1 0 6 parks et al

comparem and fastani jain et al 2018 with the default setting to calculate the amino acid identity aai and average nucleotide identity ani respectively raw metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data have been deposited into ncbi under the bioproject prjna815463 the two anammox bacteria mags recovered in this study are available in ncbi genbank with the accession number jamxdf000000000 and jamxdg000000000 2 5 15n isotope tracer experiments to quantify and differentiate the contribution of the anammox reaction and denitrification in anammox enriched biofilm 15n pairing experiments were carried out according to previous descriptions with minor revisions xue et al 2020 yang et al 2020 briefly the fresh sludge obtained from b l biofilm was transferred into a glass vial and centrifuged for 1 min at 1000 rcf the supernatant was discarded and the sludge retained for the next steps 2 g of sludge was then transferred into a serum bottle and preincubated for 24 h at room temperature to remove residual nox and then flushed with high purity helium for 15 min to remove the residual oxygen in samples before downstream treatment subsequently 15no3 99 2 15n in solution without oxygen was introduced into samples resulting in a final concentration of 100 μmol l 15n in each vial sludge incubations were performed at room temperature and the reaction was stopped by injecting 2 ml of 50 zncl2 solution at time points of 0 and 8 h the produced 29n2 and 30n2 over the incubation period were measured by membrane inlet mass spectrometry mims hiden rates of anammox and denitrification were calculated according to the methods and equations described elsewhere shan et al 2016 thamdrupdalsgaard 2002 anammox and denitrification rates were measured in triplicates 3 result and discussion 3 1 rational cascading strategies for breeding wastewater treatment the main influent of the duck breeding farm wastewater was rich in nh4 254 6 mg l and cod 2665 mg l fig 1 table s1 up to 99 63 of nh4 and 79 52 of cod were removed after the anaerobic anoxic anaerobic oxic system and 33 43 of the consumed nh4 was oxidized to no3 and no2 and then discharged into the effluent fig 1 which means a large proportion of the reactive nitrogen was removed through denitrification and anammox processes such a high nitrogen removal efficiency should be attributed to the rational design of the full scale wastewater treatment system more precisely the influent wastewater containing high cod nh4 n ratio 10 45 fig 1 table s1 is an obstacle for creating favorable conditions for ammonium ammonia removal zhang et al 2019 in accordance with many tested processes gu et al 2018 lemasuarez 2017 the anaerobic tank 1 a do 0 01 mg l was designed for cod removal with approximately 83 62 of cod successfully degraded in 1 a which provided a low cod for the following nitrogen removal especially anammox enrichment in the biofilm at the same time 38 64 of nh4 97 74 mg l was removed in the anaerobic tank 1 a via nitrification probably due to the backflow of wastewater from the oxic tank 2 o carrying trace amounts of oxygen in addition 8 21 mg l of nox were detected in the effluent of 1 a likely due to the consumption of the residual nox by denitrifiers to achieve cost effective inorganic nitrogen removal via anammox reactions polyurethane sponge carriers which was used to provide a favourable support structure for anammox bacterial growth yang et al 2021a were introduced into the two parts of anoxic tank 1 o the do concentration in the tank was kept at 0 21 mg l after aeration for one hour with an interval of 10 min moreover approximately a ratio of 1 1 45 for nh4 n no2 n was regulated in the influent wastewater for providing anammox bacteria sufficient substrates although the ratio of cod nh4 n was about 7 34 it did not appear to influence the enrichment of anammox bacteria on the carrier a similar phenomenon was also reported previously in that anammox bacteria were enriched in gca biofilm at a high ratio of cod nh4 n 15 0 yang et al 2021b furthermore the overall conditions for enrichment of anammox bacteria onto the carrier were favourable fan et al 2022 wang et al 2022 with the available ions such as fe2 cu2 zn2 and so4 detected in the anoxic tank 1 o table s1 approximately 42 03 of nh4 19 92 mg l and 40 88 of no2 13 31 mg l were consumed and 0 89 mg l of no3 was produced in the anoxic tank 1 o indicating highly active anammox reactions in the anoxic tank 1 o to further verify this observation based on the 15no3 isotope labeling and pairing analysis and results the nitrogen removal rate by anammox reactions 90 67 μmol kg h was 4 85 times higher than that by denitrification 18 68 μmol kg h in the anammox biofilm of b l this indicates that anammox contributed to 82 88 of total nitrogen transformation in anoxic tank biofilm b l fig 1 table s5 previous studies have found that the rate and contribution of anammox to nitrogen removal in biofilms varies with the anoxic carrier biofilms contributing to nitrogen loss at a rate of 5 41 μmoln gvss d by anammox li et al 2019 also anammox activity up to 295 μmol g ignition loss h has been measured in red biofilms in aeration tanks suto et al 2017 the contribution of anammox activity to total nitrogen removal was estimated at around 20 30 in the biofilm of the carrier in anoxic zones yuan et al 2021 and anammox contributed to 68 of the total nitrogen loss in anoxic carrier biofilms in another study li et al 2020 however in contrast with previous studies on anammox rates and the contribution of nitrogen removal in anammox enriched biofilms the anammox in biofilms of this study exhibited extremely high activity in particular after treatment in the anaerobic tank 1 a and anoxic tank 1 o approximately 89 21 227 16 mg l of nh4 were transformed the aim of the following tanks including anaerobic tank 2 a and oxic tank 2 o was to further remove the residual nh4 n and no2 n in the wastewater and the nh4 removal efficiency of 2 a and 2 o was 57 47 and 86 64 respectively fig 1 table s1 3 2 microbial genome reconstruction and community analysis microbial driven nitrogen transformation reactions are the core engine of nitrogen removal in wwtps therefore metagenomics with metatranscriptomics was combined and used to elucidate the total microbial community composition at the different treatment stages a total of 2 45 billion metagenomic raw reads and 1 08 billion metatranscriptomic non rrna reads were retained from the activated sludge samples of five treatment tanks 1 a y a y b 2 a 2 o and two biofilm samples a l and b l from the anoxic tank 1 o after de novo assembly and binning analysis of the obtained raw reads 170 155 162 172 179 167 and 156 eligible metagenome assembled genomes mags completeness 50 contamination 10 were recovered respectively from these samples table s2 table s3 most mags were assigned to bacteria such as chloroflexota bacteroidota proteobacteria nitrospirota only 23 mags were identified as archaea mainly distributed in four phyla including nanoarchaeota halobacteriota thermoproteota and methanobacteriota table s3 fig s1 actually in all activated sludge samples the top 2 most abundant bacteria belonged to anaerolineae and ignavibacteria fig s1 table s3 it should be pointed out that ignavibacteria can actively participate in dnra processes keren et al 2020 but the role of anaerolineae is still not clear in this plant additionally nitrogen transformation microorganisms namely nitrospiraceae and nitrosomonas were also identified in all samples different from the activated sludge samples ca brocadia and ca jettenia occupied an overwhelmingly dominant abundance in the two biofilm samples which was consistent with the visible red anammox granules observed in the biofilm on the carriers and also the high metabolic reaction rates demonstrated by the 15n labeling experiment 3 3 nitrogen removal related functional genes and organisms the active nitrogen transformation activity of anammox was detected in all samples especially in the carrier biofilms which were dominated by the highly transcribed core anammox bacterial genes namely hox hdh and hzs fig 2 stronger expression and activity of anammox bacteria nitrite oxidoreductase nxr was detected in biofilm compared to the activated sludge fig 2 suggesting that more nitrite was oxidized for electron generation which was then used for the reduction of nitrite to nitric oxide no hu et al 2019 additionally previous studies suggested that a high concentration of nitrite could inhibit the activity of anammox bacteria and deteriorate the nitrogen removal efficiency yang et al 2019 yu et al 2020 thus high expression of nxr likely alleviated such an adverse effect a recent study alternatively pointed out that nxr is a bifunctional enzyme with the catalytic capability of reducing nitrate to nitrite in kuenenia stuttgartiensis chicano et al 2021 thus highly active nxr seems to be essential for maintaining the survival of anammox bacteria by eliminating the accumulation of nitrite nitrite reductase nir in amammox bacteria is associated with nitrite detoxification consistent with our previous study yang et al 2020 and nir was slightly transcribed by anammox bacteria in the current study fig 2 kustc0458 and kustc4574 were implicated in the reduction of nitrite to no in kuenenia stuttgartiensis hu et al 2019 which were also identified in all obtained anammox bacteria mags in this study with considerable transcriptional activities fig 2 high transcriptional activities of ammonia monooxygenase amo and hydroxylamine oxidoreductase hao were also demonstrated fig 2 these enzymes catalyze the rapid oxidation of free ammonia to nitrite which is then further oxidized to nitrate by highly expressed nitrite oxidoreductase nxr fig 2 narg no3 reduced to no2 nirk s no2 reduced to no norb c no reduced to n2o and nosz n2o reduced to n2 were also all highly transcribed fig 2 illustrating a high denitrifying activity in the treatment plant dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra urea degradation and nitrogen fixation related genes could also be detected but with only slight transcription fig 2 nitrosomonas spp were the predominate ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob in all activated sludge and biofilm samples with a relatively high abundance of 6 28 1 a 4 65 y a 4 05 y b 5 85 2 a 5 87 2 o 3 73 a l 4 30 b l fig s2 and table s3 nitrosocosmicus as the sole ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa in the plant was captured in a l 2 a and 2 o with relatively low abundance fig s2 and table s3 the much higher concentration of organic compounds and free ammonia likely inhibited the activity of aoa gwak et al 2020 yin et al 2018 nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob were recovered from all samples with highly varied abundance 6 13 1 a 1 16 y a 1 10 y b 5 49 2 a 5 79 2 o 0 48 a l 1 15 b l growth of nob in the anoxic tank 1 o was severely suppressed 1 16 in y a 1 10 in y b 0 48 in a l and 1 15 in b l likely caused by the oxygen limitation due to the low oxygen affinity of most nob laureni et al 2016 the highly enriched anammox bacteria in the biofilm could efficiently consume the nitrite and lead to substrate limitation for the nob xiao et al 2021 in contrast residual do in the reflux from the oxic tank 2 o likely provided limited oxygen for the growth of nob in 1 a and 2 a the two anaerobic tanks fig 1 the recovered nob mags could only be classified as nitrospiraceae a family level after comparison with the gtdb tk database released 2022 version potentially indicating that they represent a new nob genus in accordance with previous studies that complete ammonia oxidation comammox bacteria favor oligotrophic ecosystems kits et al 2017 sakoula et al 2021 comammox bacteria were not detected in the wwtp mainly due to the high ammonium content only one ca brocadia mag was detected in the activated sludge samples with a relatively low abundance of 0 39 0 56 0 68 0 70 and 0 48 in 1 a y a y b 2 a 2 o respectively fig s2 a high enrichment of anammox bacteria was achieved in the two carrier biofilms a l and b l with relative abundances up to 20 17 and 28 72 respectively fig s2 the results suggest that the unique pore structure of the hydrophilic polyurethane sponge provides a preferable microenvironment for anammox bacteria to attach and proliferate yang et al 2021a 2020 unlike nitrification and anammox reactions denitrification and dnra were carried out by a diverse population of microorganisms in this study the number of mags with at least one dnra functional gene in the activated sludge and biofilm samples was 25 14 71 31 20 28 17 28 26 15 12 21 11 73 18 10 78 and 23 14 74 in 1 a y a y b 2 a 2 o a l and b l respectively dnra related organisms were mainly distributed in phyla actinobacteriota planctomycetota and proteobacteria fig s1 denitrifying bacteria had a wider distribution accounting for 50 59 1 a 55 48 y a 63 58 y b 47 67 2 a 51 95 2 o 47 31 a l 44 87 b l respectively proteobacteria and chloroflexota are two denitrifying bacterial phyla with a high frequency of occurrence fig s1 3 4 construction of the complex nitrogen transformation reaction network through metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data analysis the nitrogen transformation network dominated by ammonia oxidation and nitrate removal was identified and is presented fig 3 a typical snad process was established in each tank with sligh differences in which nitrification and denitrification were the two major components in all tanks specifically the overall activity of ammonia oxidation in two anaerobic tanks 1 a and 2 a was significantly weaker than the anoxic tank 1 a and oxic tank 2 o because of the low availability of oxygen figs 1 and 3 97 74 mg l and 13 21 mg l of nh4 n were removed in the anaerobic tanks of 1 a and 2 a respectively likely due to the slight amount of oxygen carried by reflux from the oxic tank 2 o interestingly only 8 21 mg l of nox was accumulated in the anaerobic tank 1 a and at the same time genes that related to the denitrification such as narg and napa also showed a higher expression level in the anaerobic tank 1 a compared to the other tanks this should lead to a rapid consumption of nox produced by nitrification and carried from the no3 rich wastewater reflux from the oxic tank of 2 o fig 3 in comparison with two anaerobic tanks 1 a and 2 a the transcriptional activity of the amo gene was enhanced by the intervention of oxygen in anoxic tank 1 o and oxic tank 2 o resulting in more consumption of ammonium by nitrification pathways figs 2 and 3 the hao gene however did not show the anticipated activity in all tank suspended sludge samples figs 2 and 3 available results suggest that hydroxylamine could be converted to n2o directly via cytochrome p460 by the typical aob nitrosomonas europaea caranto et al 2016 therefore an open question about the accumulation of hydroxylamine in the system needs to be further confirmed nitrite oxidation was well catalyzed by nxr in each tank fig 3 which supplied sufficient no3 n for denitrifying bacteria and dnra bacteria even if the free ammonia was larger than the inhibition thresholds of nitrospira ushiki et al 2017 the presence of nob in suspended sludge of two anaerobic tanks 1 a and 2 a might be due to microbial migration from influent wastewater and oxic tank 2 o anammox bacteria were detected in all activated sludge samples but transcript levels from anammox core metabolic genes revealed that anammox were not the key drivers for mainstream nitrogen removal fig 3 table s3 in contrast to the activated sludge systems the abundance and activity of anammox bacteria were strikingly high in biofilms on carriers submerged in the anoxic tanks similar phenomena have also been observed in other wastewater treatment systems li et al 2021 yang et al 2020 in which porous materials were regarded as a preferable support for growth of anammox bacteria to thrive in the vibrating wwtp environments the high abundance of anammox bacteria on carriers contributed to the inorganic nitrogen removal in the relevant tanks fig 4 in the two biofilms there were stronger transcriptional activities of hzs hox and hdh of the core anammox reactions which was also supported by 15n isotope results in that the rate of anammox reaction was 90 67 μmol kg h in b l consistent with the results of n 15 labeling except nirk s the activity of almost all genes associated with anammox was significantly higher than that of genes involved with the denitrification process such as napa narg norb c and nosz additionally the activity of nitrification in biofilms was much lower than that in activated sludge likely due to the low oxygen available in the biofilm figs 4 5 and s2 partial denitrification was also detected in the biofilms and high transcriptional activity of nirk s supported the fast conversion of nitrite to no figs 4a and 4b the produced no is then a critical substrate for anammox reactions hu et al 2019 and the high nitrite reduction activity likely stimulates growth of anammox bacteria in addition the high transcriptional activity of nxr in anammox bacteria likely allowed the discharge of no3 to effluent wastewater in contrast in tank 1 a which includes both suspended sludge and the biofilm carrier the abundance of nob decreased sharply and their activities were also weaker than in the other tanks fig 2 likely resulting from the low concentration of dissolved oxygen and high enrichment of anammox bacteria dnra bacteria were also involved in the overall nitrogen transformation in the biofilm but their activity was much lower compared to other pathways dnra bacteria prefer to live in environments with excess electron donors and nitrate limiting conditions additionally the promoter of the nrfa gene could be repressed by the fluctuating oxygen in the complex wastewater treatment systems van den berg et al 2015 3 5 recovery and identification of new anammox bacteria a total of 9 anammox bacterial mags were recovered from different treatment tanks of this wwtp table s6 they were assigned to two groups based on 43 concatenated marked genes using a greater than 99 9 aai similarity with each other in each group so that these 9 mags represent two anammox bacterial species to investigate them further two high quality completeness 97 contamination 3 mags pf01 and pf02 were selected from 1 a and b l table s3 for further taxonomy and potential ecological function analyses pf01 and pf02 were classified into the two different established anammox genera based on the phylogenetic analyses of 16s rrna gene fig 5a and hzsa fig s3 mag pf01shared 99 6 similarity of the 16s rrna identity with ca brocadia sp zmp 3 fig 5a and a 97 37 ani with ca brocadia sp mag 08 fig 5b which are larger than the species cut off based on the 16s rrna gene 98 7 anantharaman et al 2016 hug et al 2016 stackebrandtebers 2006 and ani ani 95 konstantinidis et al 2017 yoon et al 2017 it is therefore concluded that mag pf01 represents a new species in ca brocadia homologous gene comparison results showed that pf01 is not the same as ca brocadia sp zmp 3 or ca brocadia sp mag 08 therefore pf01 was named ca brocadia sp pf01 pf02 formed a separate clade within ca jettenia based on the phylogenetic analyses of 16s rrna gene and 43 concatenated marked genes figs 5a and 5b and the highest 16s rrna gene identity between pf02 and other known ca jettenia genomes is 98 90 which is slightly higher than the species cut off value 98 7 anantharaman et al 2016 hug et al 2016 stackebrandtebers 2006 nevertheless the maximum ani between pf02 and reported ca jettenia strain ca jettenia sp amx3 was 94 58 which is lower than the species cut off value based on ani konstantinidis et al 2017 yoon et al 2017 it was finally consider that pf02 was a new species and therefore named ca jettenia sp pf02 3 6 metabolic versatility and activity of anammox bacteria anammox bacteria was successfully enriched in anoxic tank biofilm a l and b l which benefited from the design of the primary tanks 1 a and 1 o as mentioned above the rich cod in the influent was controlled to an acceptable level creating a ratio of cod nh4 n 2 78 in the effluent conducive for anammox based processes a typical cod nh4 n ratio of 2 0 3 0 is generally considered appropriate for these processes such as partial denitrification anammox pd amx zhang et al 2019 trace amounts of oxygen were supplied into the anoxic tank 1 o to stimulate nitrification processes for additional nitrite replenishment fig 3 and also the low dissolved oxygen severely suppressed the growth of nob fig s2 ma et al 2015a in addition to ensure that there is sufficient substrate to support the growth of anammox bacteria in the anoxic tank 1 a on average 32 56 mg l of no2 n was also introduced into 1 o table s1 moreover 1 o is designed to contain two parts y a and y b separated by a barrier which not only reduces the impact due to high effluent flow rates but also appropriately extends the solids retention time which also provides an opportunity for anammox bacterial enrichment in biofilms islam et al 2021 through characterization and quantitative analysis of the transcriptional expression of the two anammox bacterial mags the stronger transcriptional activities of hzs hdh and hox in biofilm than in activated sludge provided strong support for pf01 s biofilm niche figs 6 and s4 ca jettenia species is typically found in granular sludge anammox bioreactors or in natural environments such as soils groundwater and freshwater sediment mardanov et al 2019a however pf02 was detected in the two biofilms in relatively low abundance and not in the activated sludge previous findings suggested that two identical copies of the hzsabc gene cluster are encoded in ca brocadia ca scalindua and ca kuenenia yang et al 2018 likewise analysis of hzs in the known genome of ca jettenia sp amx49 and ca jettenia caeni brojett041 also shows two identical clusters fig s5 hosokawa et al 2021 mardanov et al 2019a 2019b indeed the coverage of the hzsabc gene cluster in pf01 and pf02 was also double expected compared with their genomes indicating pf01 and pf02 likely contain two identical copies of the hzsabc gene cluster fig s5 this result indicates that duplication of the hzs gene is a widely occurring phenomenon in anammox bacteria but the underlying reasons are not currently known the high nxr kustc0458 reduction of nitrite to no and urea degradation enzyme fig 2 expression activity of pf01 also reinforce the dominance of pf01 in the biofilm furthermore the nitrite reductase gene nrfa was detected only in pf02 which supports the occurrence of pf02 in biofilm fig 6 table s5 discrepancies in the activity of ammonia transport systems such as ammonia transporter protein amt nitrite transporter protein fnt and nitrate transporter nark mardanov et al 2019a yang et al 2021b may also responsible for the abundance of pf01 and pf02 fe2 and fe3 were proposed as anammox bacterial growth promoting factors via induction of the biosynthesis of extracellular polymeric substances eps some nitrogen metabolism genes such as hzs hao and nirs and the shortening of the doubling times of anammox bacteria sindhu et al 2021 wang et al 2021 wang et al 2022 low dosages of cu2 and zn2 also shows a positive effect on the enrichment and nitrogen removal performance of anammox bacteria chen et al 2014 fan et al 2022 fe2 cu2 and zn2 were widely available in anoxic tank 1 a table s1 which possibly facilitated the growth of anammox bacteria and the more active ferric ion transport systems may also assist pf01 to be selectively enriched instead of pf02 fig 6 the low do also secures a stronger competitive advantage for anammox bacteria in this treatment system cho et al 2020 ma et al 2015b in fact oxygen serves as a negative regulator for anammox bacteria reaching 50 inhibition at dissolved oxygen concentrations of 0 03 to 3 8 mg l seuntjens et al 2018 a sophisticated oxygen resistance system composed of superoxide dismutase sod superoxide reductase dfx thioredoxin reductase txra and peroxiredoxin reductase prdx hu et al 2021 lombard et al 2001 sethu et al 2016 tan et al 2019 yang et al 2021b is therefore thought to play a significant role in the survival and growth of pf01 and pf02 in the oxygen fluctuating wastewater treatment system fig 6 4 conclusions high ammonium removal efficiency 99 63 was achieved in the full scale wwtp via an anaerobic anoxic anaerobic oxic system efficient removal was achieved by the enrichment of anammox bacteria in the anoxic tank 1 o by introducing the polyurethane sponge as a carrier material in particular influent ammonia was rapidly consumed by nitrification catalyzed by aob aoa and nob and the denitrifying bacteria and anammox bacteria collectively convert the nox into nitrogen gas for inorganic nitrogen removal the dinitrogen gas formed by the anammox reaction was 4 85 times higher than that by denitrification indicating the effectiveness of the highly enriched anammox bacteria attached on the sponge carriers two distinct anammox bacterial mags were recovered from the treatment plant which achieved significant enrichment in the carrier biofilms appreciable nh4 n and no2 n together with other ions provide anammox bacteria sufficient substrates and stimulate their enrichment and activity moreover low do suppressed the growth of nob in the microbial community improving the nitrite availability for anammox bacteria metabolic analysis revealed that a highly active ammonium nitrite nitrate transport system metal intake capability and oxidative stress system provide pf01 a niche to survive in complex wastewater treatment based on the current results the anammox reaction is an important process in effectively treating breeding wastewater anammox bacteria can be successfully enriched in low do and high cod n environments while nob are maintained in low abundance these results provide a valuable strategy for full scale wwtp anammox bacterial enrichment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

14898,microbial driven nitrogen removal is a crucial step in modern full scale wastewater treatment plants wwtps and the complexity of nitrogen transformation is integral to the various wastewater treatment processes a full understanding of the overall nitrogen cycling networks in wwtps is therefore a prerequisite for the further enhancement and optimization of wastewater treatment processes in this study metagenomics and metatranscriptomics were used to elucidate the microbial nitrogen removal processes in an ammonium enriched full scale wwtp which was configured as an anaerobic anoxic anaerobic oxic system for efficient nitrogen removal 99 63 on a duck breeding farm a typical simultaneous nitrification anammox denitrification snad process was established in each tank of this wwtp ammonia was oxidized by ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob archaea aoa and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob and the produced nitrite and nitrate were further reduced to dinitrogen gas n2 by anammox and denitrifying bacteria visible red anammox biofilms were formed successfully on the sponge carriers submerged in the anoxic tank and the nitrogen removal rate by anammox reaction was 4 85 times higher than that by denitrification based on 15n isotope labeling and analysis this supports the significant accumulation of anammox bacteria on the carriers responsible for efficient nitrogen removal two distinct anammox bacteria named ca brocadia sp pf01 and ca jettenia sp pf02 were identified from the biofilm in this investigation by recovering their genomic features and their metabolic capabilities our results indicate that the highly active core anammox process found in pf01 suggests extending its niche within the plant with the possible contribution of the dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra reaction enriching pf02 within the biofilm may also be warranted collectively this study highlights the effective design strategies of a full scale wwtp with enrichment of anammox bacteria on the carrier materials for nitrogen removal and therefore the biochemical reaction mechanisms of the contributing members graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nitrogen cycle snad 15n isotope labeling biofilm anammox data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction full scale wastewater treatment plants wwtps are effective means for treating nitrogen containing wastewaters including municipal wastewater industrial wastewater and livestock wastewater alhassan et al 2020 various wastewater treatment processes are in operation including the a o anoxic oxic process the a2 o anaerobic anoxic oxic process the sequencing batch reactor sbr the activated sludge process and the biofilm process chen et al 2019 nie et al 2012 sonune and ghate 2004 the complex microbial community driven by sophisticated nitrogen cycling networks in wwtp is effective for nitrogen removal in the conventional wastewater treatment process ammonium nh4 is finally converted to nitrogen gas n2 through a combination of nitrification and denitrification processes however obstacles such as oxygen and external nutrient supply high energy consumption and excessive sludge production can prevent achievement of high operation efficiency liu et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 the process of anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox is an autotrophic metabolism that combines nh4 and nitrite no2 directly into n2 providing a shortcut strategy for nitrogen removal the anammox reaction is also regarded as a cost effective and sustainable nitrogen removal approach to replace the energy intensive conventional treatment processes kuenen 2008 weralupitiya et al 2021 several configurations containing anammox reactions are available in wastewater treatment e g partial nitrification anammox pn amx partial denitrification anammox pd amx simultaneous nitrification anammox and denitrification snad and partial nitrification anammox and methane dependent nitrite nitrate reduction pnam liu et al 2021 zhuang et al 2022 for instance pn amx shows optimal performance in treating ammonia rich wastewater with a strict ratio of 0 5 for chemical oxygen demand cod to nitrogen in the water daigger 2014 kang et al 2018 lackner et al 2014 biodegradable cod ubiquitous in wastewater with a high c n ratio henze et al 2008 lackner et al 2014 will deteriorate the stable operation of the pn amx system alternatively denitrification can be integrated into the system of pd amx and snad for an effective treatment with a wider range of cod concentrations liu et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 zhuang et al 2022 ammonium is readily available in wastewater but a stable and adequate no2 supply becomes the key factor for efficient application of anammox based processes zhang et al 2019 however pd amx and snad anammox reactions may be blocked under conditions that favor no2 utilizing nob as competitors or denitrifying bacteria thriving under sufficient cod supply jenni et al 2014 xu et al 2015 zhang et al 2019 zhuang et al 2022 most recently a distinct technology pnam has been developed and applied in a single membrane biofilm reactor mbfr to address this problem in such a system nob compete for available nitrite with anammox and nitrite nitrate dependent anaerobic methane oxidation n damo bacteria or archaea growth of n damo microorganisms can be accelerated by introducing methane resulting in lack of the nitrite for nob growth liu et al 2021 even though efficiency of nitrogen removal can be gradually improved and be cost effective it is important to understand the nitrogen cycling pathways and the active microorganisms to better improve the wastewater treatment processe the anammox reaction is a promising nitrogen removal pathway for sustainable removal of both no2 and nh4 by direct autotrophic coupling however anammox bacteria grow slowly and are very sensitive to the harsh environmental conditions of wwtps kuenen 2008 li et al 2021 zhuang et al 2022 from reported results porous carriers can create a favorable micro environment for the survival and enrichment of anammox bacteria thereby increase their biomass li et al 2021 yang et al 2021a 2020 this in turn provides a practical way to stimulate anammox in wwtps in addition the centrality of the anammox reaction in the overall metabolism of nitrogen has been analyzed and the feasibility of inoculation of a high density of anammox bacterial aggregates in sludge into full scale wwtps has been confirmed yang et al 2020 although a straightforward and effective strategy would be to utilize anammox bacterial biomass for inoculation it is very time consuming to produce large quantities of this biomass and there is no guarantee that the inoculation will be successful however visible red granules of anammox bacteria can be observed occasionally in full scale operating wwtps meng et al 2017 and such anammox enriched sludge can be an effective inoculation to establish more anammox processes in additional wwpts comparing two typical carrier material types microporous and macroporous carriers in full scale pn amx reactors anammox enriched biofilms were established on both of them but thicker biofilms and stronger denitrification efficiency were found on the microporous carriers yang et al 2021a recently li et al revealed that the abundance of anammox bacteria on the carrier was mostly influenced by suspended biomass which relieve the pressure from toxicity and inhibition by no2 li et al 2021 recently a granular activated carbon gac anammox biofilm combined with two activated sludge systems was constructed for treating landfill leachate and a new anammox genus ca loosdrechtia was identified yang et al 2021b 2022 in summary utilization of biofilm carriers is a workable strategy for anammox enrichment and nitrogen removal in wastewater treatment processes but most results are currently based on laboratory level bioreactors li et al 2021 zhuang et al 2022 or inoculation of high density anammox bacteria into the full scale wwtps meng et al 2017 yang et al 2020 yang et al 2021 mechanisms contributing to the natural enrichment of anammox bacteria attached to carrier materials in full scale wwtps have not been fully elucidated in this study a high ammonium removal efficiency 99 63 cascading system achieved through the interactions of different microbial groups active in a full scale wwtp was investigated the plant was equipped with a typical continuous anaerobic anoxic anaerobic oxic process for the treatment of cod and ammonium rich duck breeding wastewater additionally anammox bacteria that were naturally enriched in porous material played a significant role in the nitrogen transformation process the objectives of this study were to i understand the underlying mechanisms of high efficiency nitrogen removal through an in depth analysis of the technological characteristics of the targeted wwtp ii construct the complex nitrogen metabolic networks in different wastewater treatment reactors stages based on an in situ metatranscriptomics study and further explain the mechanism of efficient nitrogen removal at the microbial level iii reveal the underlying environmental factors nh4 n and no2 n concentrations ion concentrations and metabolic characteristics that contribute to the natural enrichment of anammox bacteria in the carrier biofilms metagenomics and metatranscriptomics approaches were used to study the microbial communities and activities responsible for nitrogen removal the contributions of anammox and denitrification on nitrogen removal in carrier biofilms were further quantified by the 15n isotope amendment and incubation analysis the overall nitrogen transformation pathways in different stage reactors and biofilms were described by the transcriptional levels of relevant genes the central metabolism by anammox bacteria for nitrogen removal was evaluated with the gene content of reconstructed genomes metatranscriptome and n 15 data 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling nucleic acid extraction and sequencing a full scale wwtp located in guangzhou guangdong province china was designed to treat cod and ammonium rich duck breeding wastewater the full scale wwtp has been operated as a conventional activated sludge system consisting of a primary treatment tank anaerobic 1 a anoxic 1 o 192 m3 of each tank and a second treatment tank anaerobic 2 a oxic 2 o 216 m3 of each tank fig 1 the primary anoxic tank 1 o was divided into two parts y a and y b and polyurethane sponge carriers were introduced to promote the growth of anammox bacteria into visible red granules the effluent wastewater from anoxic tank y b was returned back to anaerobic tank 1 a with an approximate flow of 20 25 m3 h and the effluent wastewater from oxic tank 2 o was pumped back to anaerobic tank 2 a and 1 a with an inflow rate of 10 15 m3 h fig 1 before sampling the wwtp had been operated with the breeding farm wastewater for more than one year some basic parameters including chemical oxygen demand cod salinity hydraulic retention time hrt ph and the concentrate of ammonium nitrite nitrate are analyzed and presented fig 1 table s1 wastewater in the system maintained a flow rate of 13 m3 h resulting in a retention time of 10 14 h in the primary tank 1 a 1 o and 12 16 h in the second tank 2 a 2 o the operating temperature of all tanks in the plant was kept at around 34 c and the ph value was maintained at approximately 8 0 samples in this study were collected from this wwtp in june 2021 for an investigation of nitrogen removal efficiency and the microbial driven nitrogen transformation network fresh activated sludge samples were obtained from anaerobic tank 1 a anoxic tank y a and y b anaerobic tank 2 a and oxic tank 2 o and biofilm samples were collected from the sponge carriers in the two parts of the anoxic tank y a and y b samples were preserved on site after collection in lifeguard soil preservation qiagen shanghai for dna and rna extraction the procedures used for dna and rna extraction were those provided in the kit handbooks qiagen shanghai shotgun metagenomic

nitrogen cycle construction and anammox bacterial mags annotation predicted orfs from scaffolds were analyzed by blastp searches against a custom nitrogen cycle database with the requirements of e value 10e 10 amino acid identities 60 and a minimum alignment length 50 afterward the overall nitrogen cycles in each reactor or biofilm were constructed based on the transcriptional levels of different nitrogen cycle related genes to improve the quality of obtained anammox bacteria mags re assembling was carried out using the previously described protocol yang et al 2020a yang et al 2021 briefly two anammox bacteria mags were mapped onto the clean reads using bbmap bushnell 2014 and the successfully aligned reads were re assembled using spades v3 12 0 bankevich et al 2012 with the k

comparem and fastani jain et al 2018 with the default setting to calculate the amino acid identity aai and average nucleotide identity ani respectively raw metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data have been deposited into ncbi under the bioproject prjna815463 the two anammox bacteria mags recovered in this study are available in ncbi genbank with the accession number jamxdf000000000 and jamxdg000000000 2 5 15n isotope tracer experiments to quantify and differentiate the contribution of the anammox reaction and denitrification in anammox enriched biofilm 15n pairing experiments were carried out according to previous descriptions with minor revisions xue et al 2020 yang et al 2020 briefly the fresh sludge obtained from b l biofilm was transferred into a glass vial and centrifuged for 1 min at 1000 rcf the supernatant was discarded and the sludge retained for the next steps 2 g of sludge was then transferred into a serum bottle and preincubated for 24 h at room temperature to remove residual nox and then flushed with high purity helium for 15 min to remove the residual oxygen in samples before downstream treatment subsequently 15no3 99 2 15n in solution without oxygen was introduced into samples resulting in a final concentration of 100 μmol l 15n in each vial sludge incubations were performed at room temperature and the reaction was stopped by injecting 2 ml of 50 zncl2 solution at time points of 0 and 8 h the produced 29n2 and 30n2 over the incubation period were measured by membrane inlet mass spectrometry mims hiden rates of anammox and denitrification were calculated according to the methods and equations described elsewhere shan et al 2016 thamdrupdalsgaard 2002 anammox and denitrification rates were measured in triplicates 3 result and discussion 3 1 rational cascading strategies for breeding wastewater treatment the main influent of the duck breeding farm wastewater was rich in nh4 254 6 mg l and cod 2665 mg l fig 1 table s1 up to 99 63 of nh4 and 79 52 of cod were removed after the anaerobic anoxic anaerobic oxic system and 33 43 of the consumed nh4 was oxidized to no3 and no2 and then discharged into the effluent fig 1 which means a large proportion of the reactive nitrogen was removed through denitrification and anammox processes such a high nitrogen removal efficiency should be attributed to the rational design of the full scale wastewater treatment system more precisely the influent wastewater containing high cod nh4 n ratio 10 45 fig 1 table s1 is an obstacle for creating favorable conditions for ammonium ammonia removal zhang et al 2019 in accordance with many tested processes gu et al 2018 lemasuarez 2017 the anaerobic tank 1 a do 0 01 mg l was designed for cod removal with approximately 83 62 of cod successfully degraded in 1 a which provided a low cod for the following nitrogen removal especially anammox enrichment in the biofilm at the same time 38 64 of nh4 97 74 mg l was removed in the anaerobic tank 1 a via nitrification probably due to the backflow of wastewater from the oxic tank 2 o carrying trace amounts of oxygen in addition 8 21 mg l of nox were detected in the effluent of 1 a likely due to the consumption of the residual nox by denitrifiers to achieve cost effective inorganic nitrogen removal via anammox reactions polyurethane sponge carriers which was used to provide a favourable support structure for anammox bacterial growth yang et al 2021a were introduced into the two parts of anoxic tank 1 o the do concentration in the tank was kept at 0 21 mg l after aeration for one hour with an interval of 10 min moreover approximately a ratio of 1 1 45 for nh4 n no2 n was regulated in the influent wastewater for providing anammox bacteria sufficient substrates although the ratio of cod nh4 n was about 7 34 it did not appear to influence the enrichment of anammox bacteria on the carrier a similar phenomenon was also reported previously in that anammox bacteria were enriched in gca biofilm at a high ratio of cod nh4 n 15 0 yang et al 2021b furthermore the overall conditions for enrichment of anammox bacteria onto the carrier were favourable fan et al 2022 wang et al 2022 with the available ions such as fe2 cu2 zn2 and so4 detected in the anoxic tank 1 o table s1 approximately 42 03 of nh4 19 92 mg l and 40 88 of no2 13 31 mg l were consumed and 0 89 mg l of no3 was produced in the anoxic tank 1 o indicating highly active anammox reactions in the anoxic tank 1 o to further verify this observation based on the 15no3 isotope labeling and pairing analysis and results the nitrogen removal rate by anammox reactions 90 67 μmol kg h was 4 85 times higher than that by denitrification 18 68 μmol kg h in the anammox biofilm of b l this indicates that anammox contributed to 82 88 of total nitrogen transformation in anoxic tank biofilm b l fig 1 table s5 previous studies have found that the rate and contribution of anammox to nitrogen removal in biofilms varies with the anoxic carrier biofilms contributing to nitrogen loss at a rate of 5 41 μmoln gvss d by anammox li et al 2019 also anammox activity up to 295 μmol g ignition loss h has been measured in red biofilms in aeration tanks suto et al 2017 the contribution of anammox activity to total nitrogen removal was estimated at around 20 30 in the biofilm of the carrier in anoxic zones yuan et al 2021 and anammox contributed to 68 of the total nitrogen loss in anoxic carrier biofilms in another study li et al 2020 however in contrast with previous studies on anammox rates and the contribution of nitrogen removal in anammox enriched biofilms the anammox in biofilms of this study exhibited extremely high activity in particular after treatment in the anaerobic tank 1 a and anoxic tank 1 o approximately 89 21 227 16 mg l of nh4 were transformed the aim of the following tanks including anaerobic tank 2 a and oxic tank 2 o was to further remove the residual nh4 n and no2 n in the wastewater and the nh4 removal efficiency of 2 a and 2 o was 57 47 and 86 64 respectively fig 1 table s1 3 2 microbial genome reconstruction and community analysis microbial driven nitrogen transformation reactions are the core engine of nitrogen removal in wwtps therefore metagenomics with metatranscriptomics was combined and used to elucidate the total microbial community composition at the different treatment stages a total of 2 45 billion metagenomic raw reads and 1 08 billion metatranscriptomic non rrna reads were retained from the activated sludge samples of five treatment tanks 1 a y a y b 2 a 2 o and two biofilm samples a l and b l from the anoxic tank 1 o after de novo assembly and binning analysis of the obtained raw reads 170 155 162 172 179 167 and 156 eligible metagenome assembled genomes mags completeness 50 contamination 10 were recovered respectively from these samples table s2 table s3 most mags were assigned to bacteria such as chloroflexota bacteroidota proteobacteria nitrospirota only 23 mags were identified as archaea mainly distributed in four phyla including nanoarchaeota halobacteriota thermoproteota and methanobacteriota table s3 fig s1 actually in all activated sludge samples the top 2 most abundant bacteria belonged to anaerolineae and ignavibacteria fig s1 table s3 it should be pointed out that ignavibacteria can actively participate in dnra processes keren et al 2020 but the role of anaerolineae is still not clear in this plant additionally nitrogen transformation microorganisms namely nitrospiraceae and nitrosomonas were also identified in all samples different from the activated sludge samples ca brocadia and ca jettenia occupied an overwhelmingly dominant abundance in the two biofilm samples which was consistent with the visible red anammox granules observed in the biofilm on the carriers and also the high metabolic reaction rates demonstrated by the 15n labeling experiment 3 3 nitrogen removal related functional genes and organisms the active nitrogen transformation activity of anammox was detected in all samples especially in the carrier biofilms which were dominated by the highly transcribed core anammox bacterial genes namely hox hdh and hzs fig 2 stronger expression and activity of anammox bacteria nitrite oxidoreductase nxr was detected in biofilm compared to the activated sludge fig 2 suggesting that more nitrite was oxidized for electron generation which was then used for the reduction of nitrite to nitric oxide no hu et al 2019 additionally previous studies suggested that a high concentration of nitrite could inhibit the activity of anammox bacteria and deteriorate the nitrogen removal efficiency yang et al 2019 yu et al 2020 thus high expression of nxr likely alleviated such an adverse effect a recent study alternatively pointed out that nxr is a bifunctional enzyme with the catalytic capability of reducing nitrate to nitrite in kuenenia stuttgartiensis chicano et al 2021 thus highly active nxr seems to be essential for maintaining the survival of anammox bacteria by eliminating the accumulation of nitrite nitrite reductase nir in amammox bacteria is associated with nitrite detoxification consistent with our previous study yang et al 2020 and nir was slightly transcribed by anammox bacteria in the current study fig 2 kustc0458 and kustc4574 were implicated in the reduction of nitrite to no in kuenenia stuttgartiensis hu et al 2019 which were also identified in all obtained anammox bacteria mags in this study with considerable transcriptional activities fig 2 high transcriptional activities of ammonia monooxygenase amo and hydroxylamine oxidoreductase hao were also demonstrated fig 2 these enzymes catalyze the rapid oxidation of free ammonia to nitrite which is then further oxidized to nitrate by highly expressed nitrite oxidoreductase nxr fig 2 narg no3 reduced to no2 nirk s no2 reduced to no norb c no reduced to n2o and nosz n2o reduced to n2 were also all highly transcribed fig 2 illustrating a high denitrifying activity in the treatment plant dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra urea degradation and nitrogen fixation related genes could also be detected but with only slight transcription fig 2 nitrosomonas spp were the predominate ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob in all activated sludge and biofilm samples with a relatively high abundance of 6 28 1 a 4 65 y a 4 05 y b 5 85 2 a 5 87 2 o 3 73 a l 4 30 b l fig s2 and table s3 nitrosocosmicus as the sole ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa in the plant was captured in a l 2 a and 2 o with relatively low abundance fig s2 and table s3 the much higher concentration of organic compounds and free ammonia likely inhibited the activity of aoa gwak et al 2020 yin et al 2018 nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob were recovered from all samples with highly varied abundance 6 13 1 a 1 16 y a 1 10 y b 5 49 2 a 5 79 2 o 0 48 a l 1 15 b l growth of nob in the anoxic tank 1 o was severely suppressed 1 16 in y a 1 10 in y b 0 48 in a l and 1 15 in b l likely caused by the oxygen limitation due to the low oxygen affinity of most nob laureni et al 2016 the highly enriched anammox bacteria in the biofilm could efficiently consume the nitrite and lead to substrate limitation for the nob xiao et al 2021 in contrast residual do in the reflux from the oxic tank 2 o likely provided limited oxygen for the growth of nob in 1 a and 2 a the two anaerobic tanks fig 1 the recovered nob mags could only be classified as nitrospiraceae a family level after comparison with the gtdb tk database released 2022 version potentially indicating that they represent a new nob genus in accordance with previous studies that complete ammonia oxidation comammox bacteria favor oligotrophic ecosystems kits et al 2017 sakoula et al 2021 comammox bacteria were not detected in the wwtp mainly due to the high ammonium content only one ca brocadia mag was detected in the activated sludge samples with a relatively low abundance of 0 39 0 56 0 68 0 70 and 0 48 in 1 a y a y b 2 a 2 o respectively fig s2 a high enrichment of anammox bacteria was achieved in the two carrier biofilms a l and b l with relative abundances up to 20 17 and 28 72 respectively fig s2 the results suggest that the unique pore structure of the hydrophilic polyurethane sponge provides a preferable microenvironment for anammox bacteria to attach and proliferate yang et al 2021a 2020 unlike nitrification and anammox reactions denitrification and dnra were carried out by a diverse population of microorganisms in this study the number of mags with at least one dnra functional gene in the activated sludge and biofilm samples was 25 14 71 31 20 28 17 28 26 15 12 21 11 73 18 10 78 and 23 14 74 in 1 a y a y b 2 a 2 o a l and b l respectively dnra related organisms were mainly distributed in phyla actinobacteriota planctomycetota and proteobacteria fig s1 denitrifying bacteria had a wider distribution accounting for 50 59 1 a 55 48 y a 63 58 y b 47 67 2 a 51 95 2 o 47 31 a l 44 87 b l respectively proteobacteria and chloroflexota are two denitrifying bacterial phyla with a high frequency of occurrence fig s1 3 4 construction of the complex nitrogen transformation reaction network through metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data analysis the nitrogen transformation network dominated by ammonia oxidation and nitrate removal was identified and is presented fig 3 a typical snad process was established in each tank with sligh differences in which nitrification and denitrification were the two major components in all tanks specifically the overall activity of ammonia oxidation in two anaerobic tanks 1 a and 2 a was significantly weaker than the anoxic tank 1 a and oxic tank 2 o because of the low availability of oxygen figs 1 and 3 97 74 mg l and 13 21 mg l of nh4 n were removed in the anaerobic tanks of 1 a and 2 a respectively likely due to the slight amount of oxygen carried by reflux from the oxic tank 2 o interestingly only 8 21 mg l of nox was accumulated in the anaerobic tank 1 a and at the same time genes that related to the denitrification such as narg and napa also showed a higher expression level in the anaerobic tank 1 a compared to the other tanks this should lead to a rapid consumption of nox produced by nitrification and carried from the no3 rich wastewater reflux from the oxic tank of 2 o fig 3 in comparison with two anaerobic tanks 1 a and 2 a the transcriptional activity of the amo gene was enhanced by the intervention of oxygen in anoxic tank 1 o and oxic tank 2 o resulting in more consumption of ammonium by nitrification pathways figs 2 and 3 the hao gene however did not show the anticipated activity in all tank suspended sludge samples figs 2 and 3 available results suggest that hydroxylamine could be converted to n2o directly via cytochrome p460 by the typical aob nitrosomonas europaea caranto et al 2016 therefore an open question about the accumulation of hydroxylamine in the system needs to be further confirmed nitrite oxidation was well catalyzed by nxr in each tank fig 3 which supplied sufficient no3 n for denitrifying bacteria and dnra bacteria even if the free ammonia was larger than the inhibition thresholds of nitrospira ushiki et al 2017 the presence of nob in suspended sludge of two anaerobic tanks 1 a and 2 a might be due to microbial migration from influent wastewater and oxic tank 2 o anammox bacteria were detected in all activated sludge samples but transcript levels from anammox core metabolic genes revealed that anammox were not the key drivers for mainstream nitrogen removal fig 3 table s3 in contrast to the activated sludge systems the abundance and activity of anammox bacteria were strikingly high in biofilms on carriers submerged in the anoxic tanks similar phenomena have also been observed in other wastewater treatment systems li et al 2021 yang et al 2020 in which porous materials were regarded as a preferable support for growth of anammox bacteria to thrive in the vibrating wwtp environments the high abundance of anammox bacteria on carriers contributed to the inorganic nitrogen removal in the relevant tanks fig 4 in the two biofilms there were stronger transcriptional activities of hzs hox and hdh of the core anammox reactions which was also supported by 15n isotope results in that the rate of anammox reaction was 90 67 μmol kg h in b l consistent with the results of n 15 labeling except nirk s the activity of almost all genes associated with anammox was significantly higher than that of genes involved with the denitrification process such as napa narg norb c and nosz additionally the activity of nitrification in biofilms was much lower than that in activated sludge likely due to the low oxygen available in the biofilm figs 4 5 and s2 partial denitrification was also detected in the biofilms and high transcriptional activity of nirk s supported the fast conversion of nitrite to no figs 4a and 4b the produced no is then a critical substrate for anammox reactions hu et al 2019 and the high nitrite reduction activity likely stimulates growth of anammox bacteria in addition the high transcriptional activity of nxr in anammox bacteria likely allowed the discharge of no3 to effluent wastewater in contrast in tank 1 a which includes both suspended sludge and the biofilm carrier the abundance of nob decreased sharply and their activities were also weaker than in the other tanks fig 2 likely resulting from the low concentration of dissolved oxygen and high enrichment of anammox bacteria dnra bacteria were also involved in the overall nitrogen transformation in the biofilm but their activity was much lower compared to other pathways dnra bacteria prefer to live in environments with excess electron donors and nitrate limiting conditions additionally the promoter of the nrfa gene could be repressed by the fluctuating oxygen in the complex wastewater treatment systems van den berg et al 2015 3 5 recovery and identification of new anammox bacteria a total of 9 anammox bacterial mags were recovered from different treatment tanks of this wwtp table s6 they were assigned to two groups based on 43 concatenated marked genes using a greater than 99 9 aai similarity with each other in each group so that these 9 mags represent two anammox bacterial species to investigate them further two high quality completeness 97 contamination 3 mags pf01 and pf02 were selected from 1 a and b l table s3 for further taxonomy and potential ecological function analyses pf01 and pf02 were classified into the two different established anammox genera based on the phylogenetic analyses of 16s rrna gene fig 5a and hzsa fig s3 mag pf01shared 99 6 similarity of the 16s rrna identity with ca brocadia sp zmp 3 fig 5a and a 97 37 ani with ca brocadia sp mag 08 fig 5b which are larger than the species cut off based on the 16s rrna gene 98 7 anantharaman et al 2016 hug et al 2016 stackebrandtebers 2006 and ani ani 95 konstantinidis et al 2017 yoon et al 2017 it is therefore concluded that mag pf01 represents a new species in ca brocadia homologous gene comparison results showed that pf01 is not the same as ca brocadia sp zmp 3 or ca brocadia sp mag 08 therefore pf01 was named ca brocadia sp pf01 pf02 formed a separate clade within ca jettenia based on the phylogenetic analyses of 16s rrna gene and 43 concatenated marked genes figs 5a and 5b and the highest 16s rrna gene identity between pf02 and other known ca jettenia genomes is 98 90 which is slightly higher than the species cut off value 98 7 anantharaman et al 2016 hug et al 2016 stackebrandtebers 2006 nevertheless the maximum ani between pf02 and reported ca jettenia strain ca jettenia sp amx3 was 94 58 which is lower than the species cut off value based on ani konstantinidis et al 2017 yoon et al 2017 it was finally consider that pf02 was a new species and therefore named ca jettenia sp pf02 3 6 metabolic versatility and activity of anammox bacteria anammox bacteria was successfully enriched in anoxic tank biofilm a l and b l which benefited from the design of the primary tanks 1 a and 1 o as mentioned above the rich cod in the influent was controlled to an acceptable level creating a ratio of cod nh4 n 2 78 in the effluent conducive for anammox based processes a typical cod nh4 n ratio of 2 0 3 0 is generally considered appropriate for these processes such as partial denitrification anammox pd amx zhang et al 2019 trace amounts of oxygen were supplied into the anoxic tank 1 o to stimulate nitrification processes for additional nitrite replenishment fig 3 and also the low dissolved oxygen severely suppressed the growth of nob fig s2 ma et al 2015a in addition to ensure that there is sufficient substrate to support the growth of anammox bacteria in the anoxic tank 1 a on average 32 56 mg l of no2 n was also introduced into 1 o table s1 moreover 1 o is designed to contain two parts y a and y b separated by a barrier which not only reduces the impact due to high effluent flow rates but also appropriately extends the solids retention time which also provides an opportunity for anammox bacterial enrichment in biofilms islam et al 2021 through characterization and quantitative analysis of the transcriptional expression of the two anammox bacterial mags the stronger transcriptional activities of hzs hdh and hox in biofilm than in activated sludge provided strong support for pf01 s biofilm niche figs 6 and s4 ca jettenia species is typically found in granular sludge anammox bioreactors or in natural environments such as soils groundwater and freshwater sediment mardanov et al 2019a however pf02 was detected in the two biofilms in relatively low abundance and not in the activated sludge previous findings suggested that two identical copies of the hzsabc gene cluster are encoded in ca brocadia ca scalindua and ca kuenenia yang et al 2018 likewise analysis of hzs in the known genome of ca jettenia sp amx49 and ca jettenia caeni brojett041 also shows two identical clusters fig s5 hosokawa et al 2021 mardanov et al 2019a 2019b indeed the coverage of the hzsabc gene cluster in pf01 and pf02 was also double expected compared with their genomes indicating pf01 and pf02 likely contain two identical copies of the hzsabc gene cluster fig s5 this result indicates that duplication of the hzs gene is a widely occurring phenomenon in anammox bacteria but the underlying reasons are not currently known the high nxr kustc0458 reduction of nitrite to no and urea degradation enzyme fig 2 expression activity of pf01 also reinforce the dominance of pf01 in the biofilm furthermore the nitrite reductase gene nrfa was detected only in pf02 which supports the occurrence of pf02 in biofilm fig 6 table s5 discrepancies in the activity of ammonia transport systems such as ammonia transporter protein amt nitrite transporter protein fnt and nitrate transporter nark mardanov et al 2019a yang et al 2021b may also responsible for the abundance of pf01 and pf02 fe2 and fe3 were proposed as anammox bacterial growth promoting factors via induction of the biosynthesis of extracellular polymeric substances eps some nitrogen metabolism genes such as hzs hao and nirs and the shortening of the doubling times of anammox bacteria sindhu et al 2021 wang et al 2021 wang et al 2022 low dosages of cu2 and zn2 also shows a positive effect on the enrichment and nitrogen removal performance of anammox bacteria chen et al 2014 fan et al 2022 fe2 cu2 and zn2 were widely available in anoxic tank 1 a table s1 which possibly facilitated the growth of anammox bacteria and the more active ferric ion transport systems may also assist pf01 to be selectively enriched instead of pf02 fig 6 the low do also secures a stronger competitive advantage for anammox bacteria in this treatment system cho et al 2020 ma et al 2015b in fact oxygen serves as a negative regulator for anammox bacteria reaching 50 inhibition at dissolved oxygen concentrations of 0 03 to 3 8 mg l seuntjens et al 2018 a sophisticated oxygen resistance system composed of superoxide dismutase sod superoxide reductase dfx thioredoxin reductase txra and peroxiredoxin reductase prdx hu et al 2021 lombard et al 2001 sethu et al 2016 tan et al 2019 yang et al 2021b is therefore thought to play a significant role in the survival and growth of pf01 and pf02 in the oxygen fluctuating wastewater treatment system fig 6 4 conclusions high ammonium removal efficiency 99 63 was achieved in the full scale wwtp via an anaerobic anoxic anaerobic oxic system efficient removal was achieved by the enrichment of anammox bacteria in the anoxic tank 1 o by introducing the polyurethane sponge as a carrier material in particular influent ammonia was rapidly consumed by nitrification catalyzed by aob aoa and nob and the denitrifying bacteria and anammox bacteria collectively convert the nox into nitrogen gas for inorganic nitrogen removal the dinitrogen gas formed by the anammox reaction was 4 85 times higher than that by denitrification indicating the effectiveness of the highly enriched anammox bacteria attached on the sponge carriers two distinct anammox bacterial mags were recovered from the treatment plant which achieved significant enrichment in the carrier biofilms appreciable nh4 n and no2 n together with other ions provide anammox bacteria sufficient substrates and stimulate their enrichment and activity moreover low do suppressed the growth of nob in the microbial community improving the nitrite availability for anammox bacteria metabolic analysis revealed that a highly active ammonium nitrite nitrate transport system metal intake capability and oxidative stress system provide pf01 a niche to survive in complex wastewater treatment based on the current results the anammox reaction is an important process in effectively treating breeding wastewater anammox bacteria can be successfully enriched in low do and high cod n environments while nob are maintained in low abundance these results provide a valuable strategy for full scale wwtp anammox bacterial enrichment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

the degradation of bisphenol a bpa via the nh2cl activation by graphitic carbon nitride g c3n4 photocatalysis using visible light leds at 420 nm termed as the vis420 g c3n4 nh2cl process the process

availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction monochloramine nh2cl is widely used as a primary and secondary disinfectant to inactivate pathogens in water and wastewater treatment processes and to prevent membrane biofouling especially in potable water reuse and cooling water systems bu et al 2018 patton et al 2017 chloramination is often implemented together with uvc irradiation to enhance the disinfection performance although nh2cl is a weak oxidant that is unable to degrade micropollutants the photolysis of nh2cl by uvc irradiation breaks the n cl bonds via the energy and electron transfer reactions to produce reactive chlorine species rcs reactive nitrogen species rns and hydroxyl radicals ho eqs 1 3 for the micropollutant degradation chuang et al 2017 wu et al 2019b zhang et al 2019 the de facto uvc nh2cl process has been applied in various scenarios including the uvc treatment of the chlorinated ammonia containing water and the reverse osmosis permeate with nh2cl applied in upstream chen et al 2021a and was reported to have a lower tendency to form disinfection byproducts dbps compared with the uvc chlorine process sun et al 2019 nh2cl has a molar absorbance coefficient of 371 m 1 cm 1 at λ 254 nm and cannot absorb light at the wavelength higher than 300 nm zhang et al 2019 hence nh2cl photolysis is mostly driven by fragile uvc lamps containing hazardous mercury making the uvc nh2cl process energy intensive and possess a potential risk to environment li et al 2018 the uvc irradiation alone was reported to contribute approximately 60 90 of the total ee o in the uvc nh2cl process tian et al 2020 more importantly the need for uvc irradiation creates huge barriers to degrade micropollutants using residual nh2cl formed or applied in scenarios where the uvc irradiation is largely wasted e g in water with high uvc absorbance or is difficult to access e g off grid domestic systems an alternative strategy for the nh2cl activation

micropollutant degradation in these processes compared with those in the absence of oxidants or photocatalysts the combined use of oxidants and photocatalysts allows oxidants to be activated indirectly by high wall plug efficiency blue light leds or even solar light which is impossible if these oxidants are irradiated directly the nh2cl activation driven by visible light has never been reported before the energy consumption for the micropollutant degradation would be significantly reduced if the mercury containing uvc lamps are replaced by the highly efficient and environmental friendly visible light leds hydrated electrons e a q and o 2 were reported to activate nh2cl and organic chloramines rnhcl to produce nh2 and rnh eqs 4 and 5 respectively hawkins et al 2002

potential of 1 3 v pati and acharya 2021 we hypothesize that e cb and o 2 produced from the g c3n4 photocatalysis may activate residual nh2cl in water to produce highly reactive radicals to degrade micropollutants using the high wall plug efficiency blue light leds or even solar light as the irradiation sources thus largely reducing the energy consumption and expanding the application scenarios of nh2cl based processes based on eqs 4 and 5 the nh2cl activation by e cb and o 2 may selectively break the n cl bonds in nh2cl under the electron attack to produce rns which can degrade electron

detailed procedures and instrumental parameters in text s6 3 results and discussion 3 1 nh2cl activation by g c3n4 photocatalysis for bpa degradation fig 1 a and b show the bpa degradation and nh2cl decay in various processes neither bpa degradation nor nh2cl decay was observed in the vis420 nh2cl and g c3n4 nh2cl processes indicating that nh2cl was not activated by either visible light or g c3n4 alone to produce reactive species this was further confirmed by the dft calculations details in text s7 and figure s1 the bpa degradation by the vis420 g c3n4 nh2cl process reached 86 9 and followed pseudo first order kinetics with a rate constant k bpa of 2 058 0 006 h 1 while the nh2cl decay reached 52 9 with a rate constant k n h 2 cl of 0 684 0 018 h 1 the bpa degradation was partially attributed to the photocatalysis generated o 2 and h vb at a rate constant of 1 008 0 066 h 1 details in text s8 and fig s2 more importantly the nh2cl addition increased the bpa degradation rate from 62 9 to 86 9 within 60 min and led to an approximately 100 enhancement in the k bpa in the vis420 g c3n4 nh2cl process compared with that in the vis420 g c3n4 process nevertheless adding ethanol etoh quenched the enhanced portion of the bpa degradation by the vis420 g c3n4 nh2cl process fig 1c but it did not affect the bpa degradation by the vis420 g c3n4 process details in text s9 and fig s3 as

nh2cl suggests that the enhanced bpa degradation in the vis420 g c3n4 nh2cl process was attributed to the reactive species generated from the nh2cl activation by the g c3n4 photocatalysis tests were then conducted to identify the radical species i e ho rcs and rns generated from the nh2cl activation using tert butyl alcohol tba dmob benzoic acid ba and deet as the scavengers and probes the generation of ho in the vis420 g c3n4 nh2cl process was excluded because adding excessive tba an ho scavenger k ho tba 5 108 m 1 s 1 did not affect the bpa degradation fig 1c ma and graham 2000 since etoh was used as the scavengers of ho rcs and rns in the vis420 g c3n4 nh2cl process the difference between tba and etoh addition suggests that the vis420 g c3n4 nh2cl process might produce rcs and rns the generation of rcs was also excluded using dmob k cl dmob 18 0 109 m 1 s 1 k clo dmob 2 1 109 m 1 s 1 and ba k ho ba 5 9 109 m 1 s 1 k cl ba 1 8 1010 m 1 s 1 as the probe compounds fang et al 2014 guo et al 2017 zhao et al 2021 the nh2cl addition did not enhance the dmob degradation fig 1d compared with that in the vis420 g c3n4 process suggesting that the reactive species generated from the nh2cl activation in the vis420 g c3n4 nh2cl process were not cl or clo adding ba did not affect the dmob degradation by the vis420 g c3n4 nh2cl process further excluding the generation of ho and cl in the process in addition the epr tests were further used to exclude the generation of cl in the vis420 g c3n4 nh2cl process using dpph as the spin trapping agent as shown in fig s4 however no spectrum of the trapping adduct between dpph and cl i e no centrosymmetric six peak spectrum for dpph cl was detected in the vis420 g c3n4 nh2cl process therefore cl was not produced by the nh2cl activation via the g c3n4 photocatalysis as shown in fig 1e the vis420 g c3n4 nh2cl process was found to degrade deet which was a probe compound for ho rcs and rns lu et al 2023 neta et al 1988 zhang et al 2018 while neither the vis420 g c3n4 process nor nh2cl alone could since neither ho nor rcs was generated in the vis420 g c3n4 nh2cl process the reactive species generated from the nh2cl activation were proposed to be rns which contributed to the enhanced bpa degradation in addition the epr measurement was carried out to further verify the formation of rns given that no is a critical transformative nitrogenous radical which is involved in the generation of other rns e g nh2 nh2oo and no2 cao et al 2021 2022 ptio was used as the spin trapping agent of no to further form 2 phenyl 4 4 5 5 tetramethylimidazoline 1 oxyl pti the trapping adduct of no wang et al 2023 as shown in fig 1f a five peak spectrum with an intensity ratio of 1 2 3 2 1 which was the characteristic spectrum of ptio appeared in the nh2cl g c3n4 nh2cl and vis420 g c3n4 processes while a nine peak spectrum including five peaks from ptio and additional four peaks from pti was obtained in the vis420 g c3n4 nh2cl process the signal intensities of the four peaks increased with the increasing nh2cl dosage from 5 to 20 mgcl2 l indicating that the nh2cl activation by the g c3n4 photocatalysis produced no therefore the epr experiments of no further verified the formation of rns in the vis420 g c3n4 nh2cl process thus the inhibition of bpa degradation by etoh addition in the vis420 g c3n4 nh2cl process as shown in fig 1c was mainly attributed to the rns scavenging which was also further confirmed by additional experiments details in text s10 and figure s5 3 2 mechanisms of nh2cl activation by g c3n4 photocatalysis 3 2 1 roles of photoinduced primary reactive species in rns generation since rns were identified as the major reactive species generated from the nh2cl activation the roles of the photoinduced primary reactive species in the rns generation were then determined in the vis420 g c3n4 nh2cl process o 2 h vb and rns were produced and collectively contributed to the bpa degradation thus the k bpa is calculated as follows 6 k bpa k o 2 bpa k h vb bpa k rns bpa where k o 2 bpa k h vb bpa and k rns bpa represent the apparent rate constants of the bpa degradation by o 2 h vb and rns respectively k rns bpa was calculated to be 1 050 h 1 because the k bpa increased by 1 050 h 1 from 1 008 0 066 h 1 in the vis420 g c3n4 process to 2 058 0 006 h 1 in the vis420 g c3n4 nh2cl process due to the rns generation by the nh2cl activation fig 2 a in the presence of oxalate a h vb scavenger which did not affect o 2 and rns the bpa degradation by the vis420 g c3n4 process was attributed to o 2 with a rate constant of 0 522 0 024 h 1 and the bpa degradation by the vis420 g c3n4 nh2cl processes was attributed to o 2 and rns generated from the nh2cl activation by e cb and o 2 hereafter denoted as e cb and o 2 induced rns respectively with a rate constant of 1 206 0 042 h 1 in this case the bpa degradation rate constant by e cb and o 2 induced rns was calculated to be 0 684 h 1 fig 2a which was lower than the k rns bpa 1 050 h 1 suggesting that the h vb generated from the g c3n4 photocatalysis also activated nh2cl to generate rns hereafter denoted as h vb induced rns to degrade bpa the bpa degradation rate constant by the h vb induced rns was thus determined to be 0 366 h 1 the contributions of different reactive species to the bpa degradation in the vis420 g c3n4 nh2cl process were then determined based on their calculated apparent rate constants as shown in figure s6 e cb and o 2 induced rns h vb induced rns o 2 and h vb contributed approximately 33 2 17 8 25 4 and 23 6 to the bpa degradation respectively 3 2 2 photoinduced primary reactive species induced nh2cl activation pathways the e cb and o 2 induced nh2cl activation pathways to generate rns are proposed in eqs 7 11 based on the interaction of inorganic and organic chloramines with e a q and o 2 eqs 4 and 5 hawkins et al 2002 poskrebyshev et al 2003 e cb and o 2 break the n cl bonds in nh2cl to generate nh2 eqs 7 and 8 which was further expressed in detail in text s11 subsequently the produced nh2 combines with do to form nh2oo at a rate constant of 1 2 11 108 m 1 s 1 eq 9 cao et al 2022 nh2oo is unstable and rapidly decomposes to no at a rate constant of 1 2 109 m 1 s 1 eq 10 wu et al 2019b and further reacts with do to form no2 eq 11 lewis and deen 1994 lewis et al 1995 therefore nh2 nh2oo no and no2 are proposed as the formed e cb and o 2 induced rns collectively degrading bpa in the vis420 g c3n4 nh2cl process 7 n h 2 cl e cb n h 2 c l 8 n h 2 cl o 2 n h 2 c l o 2 9 n h 2 o 2 n h 2 oo k 1 2 11 1 0 8 m 1 s 1 10 n h 2 oo h n ooh no h 2 o k 1 2 1 0 9 m 1 s 1 11 2 no o 2 2 n o 2 k 2 1 1 0 6 m 2 s 1 dft calculations were conducted to verify the proposed e cb and o 2 induced nh2cl activation pathways by simulating the transient states involved in these pathways in the vis420 g c3n4 nh2cl process as shown in fig 2b and 2c the corresponding n cl bond lengths l n cl in nh2cl and atomic charges are listed in table s2 in the e cb induced nh2cl activation pathway fig 2b the presence of e cb near the nh2cl molecule significantly enlarged the n cl bond and increased the l n cl from 1 118 to 3 323 å leading to an immediate cleavage of the n cl bond with no energy barrier the cleavage produced an nh2 moiety covered by the spin cloud density and a cl atom with a negative charge of 0 960 indicating the generation of nh2 and cl in the process while in the o 2 induced nh2cl activation pathway fig 2c o 2 as an electron donor attacked on the n cl bond in nh2cl to generate nh2 cl and o2 at an e bar 4 227 kcal mol through an endothermic process e reac 4 073 kcal mol in this pathway do essentially served as an electron mediator to capture e cb to form o 2 and subsequently transfer the electron on the o 2 to nh2cl the role of o 2 in the rns generation was further confirmed experimentally by the tests conducted at low do concentrations in the presence of the h vb scavenger oxalate on the degradation of deet the probe of rns details in text s12 compared with the activation energy barrier between e cb and nh2cl at an e bar 0 kcal mol the higher energy barrier in the initiation step of the o 2 induced nh2cl activation pathway suggests that e cb may activate nh2cl more efficiently than o 2 the nh2 formed in the e cb and o 2 induced nh2cl activation pathways then reacted spontaneously with o2 to generate nh2oo at an e bar 1 427 kcal mol through an exothermic process e reac 21 729 kcal mol these dft calculations well support the proposed e cb and o 2 induced nh2cl activation pathways for the generation of e cb and o 2 induced rns eqs 7 9 h vb as an electron acceptor may oxidize nh2cl to nhcl by abstracting one electron from the n h bond in nh2cl eq 12 similar to nh2 the formed nhcl tends to combine with do to produce nhcloo eq 13 at a rate constant of 1 2 108 m 1 s 1 zhang et al 2019 while nhcloo would not be further converted to no details in text s13 the formed h vb induced rns including nhcl and nhcloo are proposed to collectively contribute to the bpa degradation in the vis420 g c3n4 nh2cl process 12 n h 2 cl h vb nhcl h 13 nhcl o 2 nhcloo k 1 2 1 0 8 m 1 s 1 the proposed h vb induced nh2cl activation pathway was also verified by the dft calculations as shown in fig 2d the n h bond in nh2cl was cleaved by the h vb to form an nhcl moiety covered by the spin cloud density and an h atom at an e bar 8 986 kcal mol through an endothermic process e reac 6 919 kcal mol further confirming the generation of nhcl in the h vb induced nh2cl activation pathway eq 12 the released h atom was immediately absorbed onto the g c3n4 surface to avoid its recombination with the formed nhcl indicating the essential role of g c3n4 in the h vb induced rns generation the highest energy barrier suggests that the proposed h vb induced nh2cl activation pathway has the lowest efficiency among the three activation pathways this finding fits with our experimental results that the contribution of h vb induced rns 17 8 to the bpa degradation was lower than that of e cb and o 2 induced rns 33 2 in the vis420 g c3n4 nh2cl process as shown in fig 2a in addition tests on the deet degradation and nh2cl decay in the process conducted in the presence of oxalate further support our findings that e cb and o 2 induced rns may be more reactive than h vb induced rns mostly nhcl and nhcloo details in text s12 3 2 3 transformation of nitrogen species the involvement of various nitrogen containing radicals in the h vb e cb and o 2 induced nh2cl activation pathways suggests that it is worth evaluating the fates of nitrogen species in the vis420 g c3n4 nh2cl process tests were then conducted to study the decomposition of nh2cl and the formation of no 3 no 2 and ammonia in the process fig 2e shows that 52 8 of nh2cl 0 521 mgn l was decomposed during the bpa degradation in the vis420 g c3n4 nh2cl process the decomposed nh2cl was partially transformed into no 3 and no 2 with the concentrations of 0 050 and 0 005 mgn l respectively through eqs 14 and 15 the higher yield of no 3 than that of no 2 was due to the reaction between no 2 and nh2cl to no 3 eq 15 details in text s14 the nh2cl decomposition also produced 0 083 mgn l of ammonia mainly through the reactions of nh2cl towards no 2 eq 15 and nh2 eq 16 wu et al 2019b yin et al 2020 of great significance around 73 5 of the decomposed nh2cl was transformed into nitrogen containing gas such as n2 and n2o via the recombination of nhcl eq 17 and self decomposition of nh2oo and nhcloo cao et al 2022 compared with the uvc nh2cl process which converted only 20 of the decomposed nh2cl into nitrogen containing gas de laat et al 2010 li and blatchley 2009 the vis420 g c3n4 nh2cl process left much less nitrite nitrate and ammonia in water and has a potential to remove ammonia in actual water treatment through transforming it to nh2cl by chlorine addition 14 n o 2 n o 2 o h no 2 no 3 h k 2 0 1 0 8 m 2 s 1 15 n h 2 cl no 2 o h n h 3 no 3 c l k 7 6 1 0 6 m 2 s 1 16 n h 2 cl n h 2 nhcl n h 3 k 1 0 1 0 5 m 1 s 1 17 nhcl n 2 2 h 2 c l k 1 0 1 0 9 m 1 s 1 the contributions of h vb e cb and o 2 induced nh2cl activation pathways in transforming nitrogen species in the vis420 g c3n4 nh2cl process were further investigated by scavenging h vb in the presence of oxalate less nh2cl was decomposed 0 499 mgn l and larger amounts of no 3 0 067 mgn l no 2 0 007 mgn l and ammonia 0 137 mgn l were produced fig 2e in this case nh2cl was only activated by e cb and o 2 to generate nh2 and no2 with higher concentrations suggesting that the production of no 3 no 2 and ammonia in the vis420 g c3n4 nh2cl process was mainly contributed by the e cb and o 2 induced nh2cl activation pathways while a lower percentage of the decomposed nh2cl was converted to nitrogen containing gas from 73 5 to 57 7 compared with that in the absence of oxalate which may be due to the significant decrease in the nhcl production because the h vb induced nh2cl activation pathway was excluded therefore the h vb induced nh2cl activation pathway is likely to play a major role in the conversion of decomposed nh2cl to nitrogen containing gas in the vis420 g c3n4 nh2cl process 3 2 4 mechanisms of g c3n4 photocatalytic nh2cl activation and subsequent bpa degradation and nitrogen transformation scheme 1 illustrates the proposed mechanisms of the nh2cl activation and subsequent bpa degradation and the corresponding transformation of nitrogen species in the vis420 g c3n4 nh2cl process under the visible light irradiation electrons from the vb of g c3n4 are excited to the cb to produce e cb and h vb e cb reacts with do to generate o 2 toward the bpa degradation pathway i meanwhile both e cb and o 2 activate nh2cl to generate nh2 via the n cl bond cleavage the produced nh2 reacts with do to form nh2oo then to no and no2 i e e cb and o 2 induced rns which contributed to 33 2 of the bpa degradation pathway ii h vb also degrades bpa directly because of its relatively high redox potential pathway iii and breaks the n h bonds in nh2cl to generate nhcl which further reacts with do to form nhcloo nhcl and nhcloo i e h vb induced rns contributed to 17 8 of the bpa degradation pathway iv in the vis420 g c3n4 nh2cl process the decomposed nh2cl mainly transforms into nitrogen containing gas via the recombination of nhcl and the self decomposition of nh2oo and nhcloo no2 recombines to produce no 3 and no 2 and the formed no 2 is mostly oxidized by nh2cl to no 3 in addition the formed nh2 and no 2 also react with nh2cl to produce ammonia 3 3 influencing factors on bpa degradation 3 3 1 effects of g c3n4 dosages nh2cl dosages and irradiation intensities fig 3 a shows the increasing g c3n4 dosages from 0 1 to 0 7 g l increased the k bpa by 88 2 from 1 218 0 048 to 2 292 0 162 h 1 p 0 05 due to the production of larger amounts of rns however the increasing g c3n4 dosages reduced the utilization rate of nh2cl as shown by the decreasing reaction stoichiometric efficiency rse details in text s15 and figure s9 s10 fig 3b shows the k bpa increased linearly by 47 3 from 1 458 0 132 to 2 058 0 006 h 1 p 0 05 with the increasing nh2cl dosages from 1 0 to 5 0 mgcl2 l because higher concentrations of nh2cl were available to be activated by the photoinduced primary reactive species for the rns generation to enhance the bpa degradation the k bpa almost remained the same with the increasing nh2cl dosages from 5 to 10 mgcl2 l because the limited active sites on the g c3n4 were not able to produce more photoinduced primary reactive species to drive the nh2cl activation process and the nh2cl at high concentrations scavenged the produced rns when further increasing the nh2cl dosages to 15 mgcl2 l the k bpa decreased instead due to the scavenging of the produced rns by the excessive nh2cl eqs 16 18 fig 3c shows that the increasing irradiation intensities from 6 3 to 13 5 mw cm2 by 1 14 times increased the k bpa proportionally by 1 18 times from 0 948 0 036 to 2 058 0 006 h 1 p 0 05 the higher irradiation intensities enabled the generation of larger amounts of photoinduced primary reactive species via the g c3n4 photocatalysis to promote the rns generation from the nh2cl activation and the subsequent bpa degradation which was further elucidated by the calculations of the intensity normalized rate constants for the bpa degradation k hv bpa details in text s16 and figure s11 18 n h 2 n h 2 h 2 nn h 2 k 4 4 1 0 9 m 1 s 1 3 3 2 reusability of g c3n4 and degradation of various micropollutants in this work reusability experiments were conducted on g c3n4 in four consecutive bpa degradation tests under the same condition the used g c3n4 after reaction was collected by suction filtration and dried in a vacuum drying oven for 12 h then the as prepared g c3n4 was used to activate nh2cl under the visible light irradiation for the bpa degradation as shown in fig 4 a the bpa degradation efficiencies in 60 min remained the same after four cycles while its degradation rate constants only decreased by 9 3 suggesting the high stability and potential reusability of g c3n4 in the process because the produced reactive species e g h vb o 2 and rns in the process react faster with organic pollutants in water than with functional groups on the surface of g c3n4 fig 4b shows the performances of vis420 g c3n4 nh2cl process on degrading three other phenolic compounds i e atp bps and 2 4 dcp and a widely used broad spectrum antibiotic compound tc the nh2cl addition to the vis420 g c3n4 process significantly enhanced the degradation rate constants of atp bps 2 4 dcp and tc by 151 to 3 384 0 229 147 to 2 544 0 051 198 to 3 531 0 233 and 95 to 1 677 0 013 h 1 respectively compared with those in the vis420 g c3n4 process figure s12 the degradation rate constants of atp bps and 2 4 dcp in the vis420 g c3n4 nh2cl process were higher than the fitted k bpa while that of tc is lower than the fitted k bpa suggesting that the process degrade phenolic compounds faster but still performs well towards other micropollutant that are reactive towards rns 3 3 3 impacts of ph hco 3 nom cu ii and fe iii fig 5 a shows the impacts of ph and concentrations of bicarbonate hco 3 nom and copper cu ii and ferric fe iii ions on the bpa degradation by the vis420 g c3n4 nh2cl process increasing ph from 5 0 to 7 0 showed no impact on the fitted k bpa in the process while further increasing the ph values to 8 0 9 0 slightly decreased the k bpa due to the change of the g c3n4 surface charge at its point of zero charge phpzc of 7 2 details in text s17 and fig s13 zhang et al 2014 the limited impact of ph on the bpa degradation by the vis420 g c3n4 nh2cl process enables the process to be implemented within the ph range of common potable water hco 3 and nom exist ubiquitously in natural water at concentrations of 0 4 6 6 mm and 2 10 mgdoc l respectively and were reported to scavenge reactive species in the nh2cl based aops chen et al 2021c khan et al 2013 levchuk et al 2018 sun et al 2019 in the vis420 g c3n4 nh2cl process the k bpa decreased by 26 6 from 2 058 0 006 to 1 512 0 030 h 1 p 0 05 with the increasing hco 3 concentrations from 0 to 2 mm mainly because of the scavenging of photoinduced primary reactive species by hco 3 details in text s18 and fig s14 the increase in the nom concentrations from 0 to 5 0 mgdoc l only reduced the k bpa by 13 1 from 2 058 0 006 to 1 788 0 006 h 1 p 0 05 mainly due to the scavenging of rns by nom details in text s19 and figure s15 s16 in the conventional uvc nh2cl process hco 3 and nom generally act as radical scavengers to decrease the degradation rate constants of target micropollutants by 46 80 due to the rapid reactions with the produced ho and rcs bu et al 2018 buxton et al 1988 jiang et al 2020 li et al 2020a wu et al 2021 2019b as aforementioned neither ho nor rcs was produced in the vis420 g c3n4 nh2cl process and the less significant matrix impacts on the process indicate that the higher selectivity of rns towards micropollutants allows the process to have a robust performance even in the presence of hco 3 and nom cu ii in surface water ranges from 0 0005 to 1 mg l and may coexist with nh2cl in the municipal distribution systems and household plumbing due to the aging and corrosion of pipelines donohue 2004 the presence of 0 2 mg l of cu ii increased the k bpa by 134 9 from 2 058 0 006 to 4 836 0 240 h 1 mainly attributed to the role of cu ii as an electron shuttle eq 19 by accepting e cb and transforming it to nh2cl cu ii has a higher affinity toward the g c3n4 surface and serves as a more efficient mediator than do for the electron transfer cheng et al 2020 offering an alternative pathway for the nh2cl activation to enhance the bpa degradation details in text s20 and figure s17 s18 when further increasing the cu ii concentrations to 0 5 and 1 0 mg l the k bpa gradually reached a plateau i e the k bpa increased by only 29 5 6 258 0 264 h 1 and 3 2 6 456 0 180 h 1 respectively the limited sites on the g c3n4 only allowed a certain amount of cu ii adsorbed on the surface leading to the nonlinear increase of the k bpa with a plateau at the high cu ii concentrations 19 n h 2 cl e cb cu ii n h 2 c l iron has higher concentrations in water than copper and may coexist with nh2cl the redox potential of fe iii is 0 77 v suggesting it cannot serve as the electron shuttle to accelerate the process we further verify this point by investigating the effect of fe iii on the bpa degradation by the vis420 g c3n4 nh2cl process at fe iii concentrations of 0 2 0 mg l given that fe iii concentrations in rivers are 3 0 4 0 mg l khatri et al 2017 as shown in fig 5 and fig s19 the degradation of bpa by the vis420 g c3n4 nh2cl process was not affected by the fe iii addition at 0 2 0 mg l indicating that fe iii did not perform the similar enhancing effect to cu ii 3 4 evaluation of dbp formation dbps are commonly produced from the interaction between reactive species and ubiquitous and natural organics e g nom and anthropogenic pollutants the formation of dbps during bpa degradation was evaluated by adding nom 5 mgdoc l to the vis420 g c3n4 nh2cl process and is compared with that in the uvc chlorine and uvc nh2cl processes eight dbps including chloroform tcm dichloroacetonitrile dcan trichloroacetonitrile tcan dichloroacetone dcat trichloroacetone tcat trichloronitromethane tcnm chloroacetonitrile can and trichloroacetamide tcam were measured in the process as shown in fig 5b however only four dbps i e dcan tcan tcm and tcnm were detected in the vis420 g c3n4 nh2cl process the concentrations of dcan tcan tcm and tcnm after 120 min irradiation were 0 057 0 161 0 029 and 0 017 µg l respectively which were up to 6 2 2 74 42 5 and 6 8 µg l in the uvc nh2cl process in addition the uvc chlorine process was reported to produce dcan tcm and tcnm whose concentrations were in the ranges of 10 28 27 34 and 7 5 12 5 µg l respectively chen et al 2021b li et al 2020b wu et al 2019a 2019b the concentrations of dbps formed in the vis420 g c3n4 nh2cl process are two orders of magnitudes lower compared with those produced in the uvc nh2cl or uvc chlorine processes the low dbp concentrations produced in the vis420 g c3n4 nh2cl process is because less hydrophilic precursors were produced under visible light irradiation and the produced rns had a much lower tendency than rcs to form dbps via the reactions with electron rich moieties in nom cao et al 2021 deng et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 the vis420 g c3n4 nh2cl process showed an excellent performance in controlling the dbp formation during the micropollutant degradation 4 conclusions the activation of nh2cl by visible light driven photocatalysis is a practically relevant easily implementable and environmentally friendly process to produce rns for the micropollutant degradation within the ph range of common potable water experiments and dft calculations together confirmed the production of nh2 nh2oo no and no2 via the e cb and o 2 induced activation pathways and that of nhcl and nhcloo via the h vb induced activation pathway to enhance 100 of the bpa degradation compared with the vis420 g c3n4 the vis420 g c3n4 nh2cl process allows the use of high wall plug efficiency blue light leds or even solar light to activate nh2cl and the process is less affected by aqueous components e g hco 3 and nom than the uvc nh2cl process due to the high selectivity of rns towards micropollutants the presence of low concentrations of cu ii in water will significantly accelerate the rns formation and the pollutant degradation in the process thus the combined use of visible light leds g c3n4 and nh2cl greatly extends the application scenarios of nh2cl based aops e g off grid domestic systems in addition the novel aop transformed 73 5 of the decomposed nh2cl into nitrogen containing gas suggesting that the photocatalytic nh2cl activation may potentially drive a process for ammonia removal in real water treatment through transforming ammonia into nh2cl by chlorine addition the vis420 g c3n4 nh2cl process forms much lower concentrations of dbps than the uvc chlorine or uvc nh2cl processes by replacing uvc irradiation with visible light demonstrating its excellent performances in controlling emerging environmental risk during the micropollutant degradation in addition rns was reported to destroy dna and suppressed the viable but nonculturable states and reactivation of bacteria shaw et al 2018 wang et al 2022 and thus may allow the vis420 g c3n4 nh2cl process overcome the limits of the conventional

14899,the photolysis of monochloramine nh2cl a widely used disinfectant under uvc irradiation produces different radicals for the micropollutant degradation for the first time this study demonstrates the degradation of bisphenol a bpa via the nh2cl activation by graphitic carbon nitride g c3n4 photocatalysis using visible light leds at 420 nm termed as the vis420 g c3n4 nh2cl process the process produces nh2 nh2oo no and no2 via the e cb and o 2 induced activation pathways and nhcl and nhcloo via the h vb induced activation pathway the produced reactive nitrogen species rns enhanced 100 of the bpa degradation compared with the vis420 g c3n4 density functional theory calculations confirmed the proposed nh2cl activation pathways and further demonstrated that e cb o 2 and h vb induced the

availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction monochloramine nh2cl is widely used as a primary and secondary disinfectant to inactivate pathogens in water and wastewater treatment processes and to prevent membrane biofouling especially in potable water reuse and cooling water systems bu et al 2018 patton et al 2017 chloramination is often implemented together with uvc irradiation to enhance the disinfection performance although nh2cl is a weak oxidant that is unable to degrade micropollutants the photolysis of nh2cl by uvc irradiation breaks the n cl bonds via the energy and electron transfer reactions to produce reactive chlorine species rcs reactive nitrogen species rns and hydroxyl radicals ho eqs 1 3 for the micropollutant degradation chuang et al 2017 wu et al 2019b zhang et al 2019 the de facto uvc nh2cl process has been applied in various scenarios including the uvc treatment of the chlorinated ammonia containing water and the reverse osmosis permeate with nh2cl applied in upstream chen et al 2021a and was reported to have a lower tendency to form disinfection byproducts dbps compared with the uvc chlorine process sun et al 2019 nh2cl has a molar absorbance coefficient of 371 m 1 cm 1 at λ 254 nm and cannot absorb light at the wavelength higher than 300 nm zhang et al 2019 hence nh2cl photolysis is mostly driven by fragile uvc lamps containing hazardous mercury making the uvc nh2cl process energy intensive and possess a potential risk to environment li et al 2018 the uvc irradiation alone was reported to contribute approximately 60 90 of the total ee o in the uvc nh2cl process tian et al 2020 more importantly the need for uvc irradiation creates huge barriers to degrade micropollutants using residual nh2cl formed or applied in scenarios where the uvc irradiation is largely wasted e g in water with high uvc absorbance or is difficult to access e g off grid domestic systems an alternative strategy for the nh2cl activation

micropollutant degradation in these processes compared with those in the absence of oxidants or photocatalysts the combined use of oxidants and photocatalysts allows oxidants to be activated indirectly by high wall plug efficiency blue light leds or even solar light which is impossible if these oxidants are irradiated directly the nh2cl activation driven by visible light has never been reported before the energy consumption for the micropollutant degradation would be significantly reduced if the mercury containing uvc lamps are replaced by the highly efficient and environmental friendly visible light leds hydrated electrons e a q and o 2 were reported to activate nh2cl and organic chloramines rnhcl to produce nh2 and rnh eqs 4 and 5 respectively hawkins et al 2002 poskrebyshev et al 2003 in the visible light photocatalysis using graphitic carbon nitride g c3n4 whose response wavelength is up to 450 nm zhao et al 2012 e cb and o 2 are produced with a cb potential of 1 3 v pati and acharya 2021 we hypothesize that e cb and o 2 produced from the g c3n4 photocatalysis may activate residual nh2cl in water to produce highly reactive radicals to degrade micropollutants using the high wall plug efficiency blue light leds or even solar light as the irradiation sources thus largely reducing the energy consumption and expanding the application scenarios of nh2cl based processes based on eqs 4 and 5 the nh2cl activation by e cb and o 2 may selectively break the n cl bonds in nh2cl under the electron attack to produce rns which can degrade electron

detailed procedures and instrumental parameters in text s6 3 results and discussion 3 1 nh2cl activation by g c3n4 photocatalysis for bpa degradation fig 1 a and b show the bpa degradation and nh2cl decay in various processes neither bpa degradation nor nh2cl decay was observed in the vis420 nh2cl and g c3n4 nh2cl processes indicating that nh2cl was not activated by either visible light or g c3n4 alone to produce reactive species this was further confirmed by the dft calculations details in text s7 and figure s1 the bpa degradation by the vis420 g c3n4 nh2cl process reached 86 9 and followed pseudo first order kinetics with a rate constant k bpa of 2 058 0 006 h 1 while the nh2cl decay reached 52 9 with a rate constant k n h 2 cl of 0 684 0 018 h 1 the bpa degradation was partially attributed to the photocatalysis generated o 2 and h vb at a rate constant of 1 008 0 066 h 1 details in text s8 and fig s2 more importantly the nh2cl addition increased the bpa degradation rate from 62 9 to 86 9 within 60 min and led to an approximately 100 enhancement in the k bpa in the vis420 g c3n4 nh2cl process compared with that in the vis420 g c3n4 process nevertheless adding ethanol etoh quenched the enhanced portion of the bpa degradation by the vis420 g c3n4 nh2cl process fig 1c but it did not affect the bpa degradation by the vis420 g c3n4 process details in text s9 and fig s3 as etoh only reacts with highly reactive species i e ho rcs and rns barizao et al 2016 cheng et al 2017 tan et al 2020 the difference in the effects of etoh on the k bpa in the absence and presence of nh2cl suggests that the enhanced bpa degradation in the vis420 g c3n4 nh2cl process was attributed to the reactive species generated from the nh2cl activation by the g c3n4 photocatalysis tests were then conducted to identify the radical species i e ho rcs and rns generated from the nh2cl activation using tert butyl alcohol tba dmob benzoic acid ba and deet as the scavengers and probes the generation of ho in the vis420 g c3n4 nh2cl process was excluded because adding excessive tba an ho scavenger k ho tba 5 108 m 1 s 1 did not affect the bpa degradation fig 1c ma and graham 2000 since etoh was used as the scavengers of ho rcs and rns in the vis420 g c3n4 nh2cl process the difference between tba and etoh addition suggests that the vis420 g c3n4 nh2cl process might produce rcs and rns the generation of rcs was also excluded using dmob k cl dmob 18 0 109 m 1 s 1 k clo dmob 2 1 109 m 1 s 1 and ba k ho ba 5 9 109 m 1 s 1 k cl ba 1 8 1010 m 1 s 1 as the probe compounds fang et al 2014 guo et al 2017 zhao et al 2021 the nh2cl addition did not enhance the dmob degradation fig 1d compared with that in the vis420 g c3n4 process suggesting that the reactive species generated from the nh2cl activation in the vis420 g c3n4 nh2cl process were not cl or clo adding ba did not affect the dmob degradation by the vis420 g c3n4 nh2cl process further excluding the generation of ho and cl in the process in addition the epr tests were further used to exclude the generation of cl in the vis420 g c3n4 nh2cl process using dpph as the spin trapping agent as shown in fig s4 however no spectrum of the trapping adduct between dpph and cl i e no centrosymmetric six peak spectrum for dpph cl was detected in the vis420 g c3n4 nh2cl process therefore cl was not produced by the nh2cl activation via the g c3n4 photocatalysis as shown in fig 1e the vis420 g c3n4 nh2cl process was found to degrade deet which was a probe compound for ho rcs and rns lu et al 2023 neta et al 1988 zhang et al 2018 while neither the vis420 g c3n4 process nor nh2cl alone could since neither ho nor rcs was generated in the vis420 g c3n4 nh2cl process the reactive species generated from the nh2cl activation were proposed to be rns which contributed to the enhanced bpa degradation in addition the epr measurement was carried out to further verify the formation of rns given that no is a critical transformative nitrogenous radical which is involved in the generation of other rns e g nh2 nh2oo and no2 cao et al 2021 2022 ptio was used as the spin trapping agent of no to further form 2 phenyl 4 4 5 5 tetramethylimidazoline 1 oxyl pti the trapping adduct of no wang et al 2023 as shown in fig 1f a five peak spectrum with an intensity ratio of 1 2 3 2 1 which was the characteristic spectrum of ptio appeared in the nh2cl g c3n4 nh2cl and vis420 g c3n4 processes while a nine peak spectrum including five peaks from ptio and additional four peaks from pti was obtained in the vis420 g c3n4 nh2cl process the signal intensities of the four peaks increased with the increasing nh2cl dosage from 5 to 20 mgcl2 l indicating that the nh2cl activation by the g c3n4 photocatalysis produced no therefore the epr experiments of no further verified the formation of rns in the vis420 g c3n4 nh2cl process thus the inhibition of bpa degradation by etoh addition in the vis420 g c3n4 nh2cl process as shown in fig 1c was mainly attributed to the rns scavenging which was also further confirmed by additional experiments details in text s10 and figure s5 3 2 mechanisms of nh2cl activation by g c3n4 photocatalysis 3 2 1 roles of photoinduced primary reactive species in rns generation since rns were identified as the major reactive species generated from the nh2cl activation the roles of the photoinduced primary reactive species in the rns generation were then determined in the vis420 g c3n4 nh2cl process o 2 h vb and rns were produced and collectively contributed to the bpa degradation thus the k bpa is calculated as follows 6 k bpa k o 2 bpa k h vb bpa k rns bpa where k o 2 bpa k h vb bpa and k rns bpa represent the apparent rate constants of the bpa degradation by o 2 h vb and rns respectively k rns bpa was calculated to be 1 050 h 1 because the k bpa increased by 1 050 h 1 from 1 008 0 066 h 1 in the vis420 g c3n4 process to 2 058 0 006 h 1 in the vis420 g c3n4 nh2cl process due to the rns generation by the nh2cl activation fig 2 a in the presence of oxalate a h vb scavenger which did not affect o 2 and rns the bpa degradation by the vis420 g c3n4 process was attributed to o 2 with a rate constant of 0 522 0 024 h 1 and the bpa degradation by the vis420 g c3n4 nh2cl processes was attributed to o 2 and rns generated from the nh2cl activation by e cb and o 2 hereafter denoted as e cb and o 2 induced rns respectively with a rate constant of 1 206 0 042 h 1 in this case the bpa degradation rate constant by e cb and o 2 induced rns was calculated to be 0 684 h 1 fig 2a which was lower than the k rns bpa 1 050 h 1 suggesting that the h vb generated from the g c3n4 photocatalysis also activated nh2cl to generate rns hereafter denoted as h vb induced rns to degrade bpa the bpa degradation rate constant by the h vb induced rns was thus determined to be 0 366 h 1 the contributions of different reactive species to the bpa degradation in the vis420 g c3n4 nh2cl process were then determined based on their calculated apparent rate constants as shown in figure s6 e cb and o 2 induced rns h vb induced rns o 2 and h vb contributed approximately 33 2 17 8 25 4 and 23 6 to the bpa degradation respectively 3 2 2 photoinduced primary reactive species induced nh2cl activation pathways the e cb and o 2 induced nh2cl activation pathways to generate rns are proposed in eqs 7 11 based on the interaction of inorganic and organic chloramines with e a q and o 2 eqs 4 and 5 hawkins et al 2002 poskrebyshev et al 2003 e cb and o 2 break the n cl bonds in nh2cl to generate nh2 eqs 7 and 8 which was further expressed in detail in text s11 subsequently the produced nh2 combines with do to form nh2oo at a rate constant of 1 2 11 108 m 1 s 1 eq 9 cao et al 2022 nh2oo is unstable and rapidly decomposes to no at a rate constant of 1 2 109 m 1 s 1 eq 10 wu et al 2019b and further reacts with do to form no2 eq 11 lewis and deen 1994 lewis et al 1995 therefore nh2 nh2oo no and no2 are proposed as the formed e cb and o 2 induced rns collectively degrading bpa in the vis420 g c3n4 nh2cl process 7 n h 2 cl e cb n h 2 c l 8 n h 2 cl o 2 n h 2 c l o 2 9 n h 2 o

nh2cl activation pathways by simulating the transient states involved in these pathways in the vis420 g c3n4 nh2cl process as shown in fig 2b and 2c the corresponding n cl bond lengths l n cl in nh2cl and atomic charges are listed in table s2 in the e cb induced nh2cl activation pathway fig 2b the presence of e cb near the nh2cl molecule significantly enlarged the n cl bond and increased the l n cl from 1 118 to 3 323 å leading to an immediate cleavage of the n cl bond with no energy barrier the cleavage produced an nh2 moiety covered by the spin cloud density and a cl atom with a negative charge of 0 960 indicating the generation of nh2 and cl in the process while in the o 2 induced nh2cl activation pathway fig 2c o 2 as an electron donor attacked on the n cl bond in nh2cl to generate nh2 cl and o2 at an e bar 4 227 kcal mol through an endothermic process e reac 4 073 kcal mol in this pathway do essentially served as an electron mediator to capture e cb to form o 2 and subsequently transfer the electron on the o 2 to nh2cl the role of o 2 in the rns generation was further confirmed experimentally by the tests conducted at low do concentrations in the presence of the h vb scavenger oxalate on the degradation of deet the probe of rns details in text s12 compared with the activation energy barrier between e cb and nh2cl at an e bar 0 kcal mol the higher energy barrier in the initiation step of the o 2 induced nh2cl activation pathway suggests that e cb may activate nh2cl more efficiently than o 2 the nh2 formed in the e cb and o 2 induced nh2cl activation pathways then reacted spontaneously with o2 to generate nh2oo at an e bar 1 427 kcal mol through an exothermic process e reac 21 729 kcal mol these dft calculations well support the proposed e cb and o 2 induced nh2cl activation pathways for the generation of e cb and o 2 induced rns eqs 7 9 h vb as an electron acceptor may oxidize nh2cl to nhcl by abstracting one electron from the n h bond in nh2cl eq 12 similar to nh2 the formed nhcl tends to combine with do to produce nhcloo eq 13 at a rate constant of 1 2 108 m 1 s 1 zhang et al 2019 while nhcloo would not be further converted to no details in text s13 the formed h vb induced rns including nhcl and nhcloo are proposed to collectively contribute to the bpa degradation in the vis420 g c3n4 nh2cl process 12 n h 2 cl h vb nhcl h 13 nhcl o 2 nhcloo k 1 2 1 0 8 m 1 s 1 the proposed h vb induced nh2cl activation pathway was also verified by the dft calculations as shown in fig 2d the n h bond in nh2cl was cleaved by the h vb to form an nhcl moiety covered by the spin cloud density and an h atom at an e bar 8 986 kcal mol through an endothermic process e reac 6 919 kcal mol further confirming the generation of nhcl in the h vb induced nh2cl activation pathway eq 12 the released h atom was immediately absorbed onto the g c3n4 surface to avoid its recombination with the formed nhcl indicating the essential role of g c3n4 in the h vb induced rns generation the highest energy barrier suggests that the proposed h vb induced nh2cl activation pathway has the lowest efficiency among the three activation pathways this finding fits with our experimental results that the contribution of h vb induced rns 17 8 to the bpa degradation was lower than that of e cb and o 2 induced rns 33 2 in the vis420 g c3n4 nh2cl process as shown in fig 2a in addition tests on the deet degradation and nh2cl decay in the process conducted in the presence of oxalate further support our findings that e cb and o 2 induced rns may be more reactive than h vb induced rns mostly nhcl and nhcloo details in text s12 3 2 3 transformation of nitrogen species the involvement of various nitrogen containing radicals in the h vb e cb and o 2 induced nh2cl activation pathways suggests that it is worth evaluating the fates of nitrogen species in the vis420 g c3n4 nh2cl process tests were then conducted to study the decomposition of nh2cl and the formation of no 3 no 2 and ammonia in the process fig 2e shows that 52 8 of nh2cl 0 521 mgn l was decomposed during the bpa degradation in the vis420 g c3n4 nh2cl process the decomposed nh2cl was partially transformed into no 3 and no 2 with the concentrations of 0 050 and 0 005 mgn l respectively through eqs 14 and 15 the higher yield of no 3 than that of no 2 was due to the reaction between no 2 and nh2cl to no 3 eq 15 details in text s14 the nh2cl decomposition also produced 0 083 mgn l of ammonia mainly through the reactions of nh2cl towards no 2 eq 15 and nh2 eq 16 wu et al 2019b yin et al 2020 of great significance around 73 5 of the decomposed nh2cl was transformed into nitrogen containing gas such as n2 and n2o via the recombination of nhcl eq 17 and self decomposition of nh2oo and nhcloo cao et al 2022 compared with the uvc nh2cl process which converted only 20 of the decomposed nh2cl into nitrogen containing gas de laat et al 2010 li and blatchley 2009 the vis420 g c3n4 nh2cl process left much less nitrite nitrate and ammonia in water and has a potential to remove ammonia in actual water treatment through transforming it to nh2cl by chlorine addition 14 n o 2 n o 2 o

of h vb e cb and o 2 induced nh2cl activation pathways in transforming nitrogen species in the vis420 g c3n4 nh2cl process were further investigated by scavenging h vb in the presence of oxalate less nh2cl was decomposed 0 499 mgn l and larger amounts of no 3 0 067 mgn l no 2 0 007 mgn l and ammonia 0 137 mgn l were produced fig 2e in this case nh2cl was only activated by e cb and o 2 to generate nh2 and no2 with higher concentrations suggesting that the production of no 3 no 2 and ammonia in the vis420 g c3n4 nh2cl process was mainly contributed by the e cb and o 2 induced nh2cl activation pathways while a lower percentage of the decomposed nh2cl was converted to nitrogen containing gas from 73 5 to 57 7 compared with that in the absence of oxalate which may be due to the significant decrease in the nhcl production because the h vb induced nh2cl activation pathway was excluded therefore the h vb induced nh2cl activation pathway is likely to play a major role in the conversion of decomposed nh2cl to nitrogen containing gas in the vis420 g c3n4 nh2cl process 3 2 4 mechanisms of g c3n4 photocatalytic nh2cl activation and subsequent bpa degradation and nitrogen transformation scheme 1 illustrates the proposed mechanisms of the nh2cl activation and subsequent bpa degradation and the corresponding transformation of nitrogen species in the vis420 g c3n4 nh2cl process under the visible light irradiation electrons from the vb of g c3n4 are excited to the cb to produce e cb and h vb e cb reacts with do to generate o 2 toward the bpa degradation pathway i meanwhile both e cb and o 2 activate nh2cl to generate nh2 via the n cl bond cleavage the produced nh2 reacts with do to form nh2oo then to no and no2 i e e cb and o 2 induced rns which contributed to 33 2 of the bpa degradation pathway ii h vb also degrades bpa directly because of its relatively high redox potential pathway iii and breaks the n h bonds in nh2cl to generate nhcl which further reacts with do to form nhcloo nhcl and nhcloo i e h vb induced rns contributed to 17 8 of the bpa degradation pathway iv in the vis420 g c3n4 nh2cl process the decomposed nh2cl mainly transforms into nitrogen containing gas via the recombination of nhcl and the self decomposition of nh2oo and nhcloo no2 recombines to produce no 3 and no 2 and the formed no 2 is mostly oxidized by nh2cl to no 3 in addition the formed nh2 and no 2 also react with nh2cl to produce ammonia 3 3 influencing factors on bpa degradation 3 3 1 effects of g c3n4 dosages nh2cl dosages and irradiation intensities fig 3 a shows the increasing g c3n4 dosages from 0 1 to 0 7 g l increased the k bpa by 88 2 from 1 218 0 048 to 2 292 0 162 h 1 p 0 05 due to the production of larger amounts of rns however the increasing g c3n4 dosages reduced the utilization rate of nh2cl as shown by the decreasing reaction stoichiometric efficiency rse details in text s15 and figure s9 s10 fig 3b shows the k bpa increased linearly by 47 3 from 1 458 0 132 to 2 058 0 006 h 1 p 0 05 with the increasing nh2cl dosages from 1 0 to 5 0 mgcl2 l because higher concentrations of nh2cl were available to be activated by the photoinduced primary reactive species for the rns generation to enhance the bpa degradation the k bpa almost remained the same with the increasing nh2cl dosages from 5 to 10 mgcl2 l because the limited active sites on the g c3n4 were not able to produce more photoinduced primary reactive species to drive the nh2cl activation process and the nh2cl at high concentrations scavenged the produced rns when further increasing the nh2cl dosages to 15 mgcl2 l the k bpa decreased instead due to the scavenging of the produced rns by the excessive nh2cl eqs 16 18 fig 3c shows that the increasing irradiation intensities from 6 3 to 13 5 mw cm2 by 1 14 times increased the k bpa proportionally by 1 18 times from 0 948 0 036 to 2 058 0 006 h 1 p 0 05 the higher irradiation intensities enabled the generation of larger amounts of photoinduced primary reactive species via the g c3n4 photocatalysis to promote the rns generation from the nh2cl activation and the subsequent bpa degradation which was further elucidated by the calculations of the intensity normalized rate constants for the bpa degradation k hv bpa details in text s16 and figure s11 18 n h 2 n h 2 h 2 nn h 2 k 4 4 1 0 9 m 1 s 1 3 3 2 reusability of g c3n4 and degradation of various micropollutants in this work reusability experiments were conducted on g c3n4 in four consecutive bpa degradation tests under the same condition the used g c3n4 after reaction was collected by suction filtration and dried in a vacuum drying oven for 12 h then the as prepared g c3n4 was used to activate nh2cl under the visible light irradiation for the bpa degradation as shown in fig 4 a the bpa degradation efficiencies in 60 min remained the same after four cycles while its degradation rate constants only decreased by 9 3 suggesting the high stability and potential reusability of g c3n4 in the process because the produced reactive species e g h vb o 2 and rns in the process react faster with organic pollutants in water than with functional groups on the surface of g c3n4 fig 4b shows the performances of vis420 g c3n4 nh2cl process on degrading three other phenolic compounds i e atp bps and 2 4 dcp and a widely used broad spectrum antibiotic compound tc the nh2cl addition to the vis420 g c3n4 process significantly enhanced the degradation rate constants of atp bps 2 4 dcp and tc by 151 to 3 384 0 229 147 to 2 544 0 051 198 to 3 531 0 233 and 95 to 1 677 0 013 h 1 respectively compared with those in the vis420 g c3n4 process figure s12 the degradation rate constants of atp bps and 2 4 dcp in the vis420 g c3n4 nh2cl process were higher than the fitted k bpa while that of tc is lower than the fitted k bpa suggesting that the process degrade phenolic compounds faster but still performs well towards other micropollutant that are reactive towards rns 3 3 3 impacts of ph hco 3 nom cu ii and fe iii fig 5 a shows the impacts of ph and concentrations of bicarbonate hco 3 nom and copper cu ii and ferric fe iii ions on the bpa degradation by the vis420 g c3n4 nh2cl process increasing ph from 5 0 to 7 0 showed no impact on the fitted k bpa in the process while further increasing the ph values to 8 0 9 0 slightly decreased the k bpa due to the change of the g c3n4 surface charge at its point of zero charge phpzc of 7 2 details in text s17 and fig s13 zhang et al 2014 the limited impact of ph on the bpa degradation by the vis420 g c3n4 nh2cl process enables the process to be implemented within the ph range of common potable water hco 3 and nom exist ubiquitously in natural water at concentrations of 0 4 6 6 mm and 2 10 mgdoc l respectively and were reported to scavenge reactive species in the nh2cl based aops chen et al 2021c khan et al 2013 levchuk et al 2018 sun et al 2019 in the vis420 g c3n4 nh2cl process the k bpa decreased by 26 6 from 2 058 0 006 to 1 512 0 030 h 1 p 0 05 with the increasing hco 3 concentrations from 0 to 2 mm mainly because of the scavenging of photoinduced primary reactive species by hco 3 details in text s18 and fig s14 the increase in the nom concentrations from 0 to 5 0 mgdoc l only reduced the k bpa by 13 1 from 2 058 0 006 to 1 788 0 006 h 1 p 0 05 mainly due to the scavenging of rns by nom details in text s19 and figure s15 s16 in the conventional uvc nh2cl process hco 3 and nom generally act as radical scavengers to decrease the degradation rate constants of target micropollutants by 46 80 due to the rapid reactions with the produced ho and rcs bu et al 2018 buxton et al 1988 jiang et al 2020 li et al 2020a wu et al 2021 2019b as aforementioned neither ho nor rcs was produced in the vis420 g c3n4 nh2cl process and the less significant matrix impacts on the process indicate that the higher selectivity of rns towards micropollutants allows the process to have a robust performance even in the presence of hco 3 and nom cu ii in surface water ranges from 0 0005 to 1 mg l and may coexist with nh2cl in the municipal distribution systems and household plumbing due to the aging and corrosion of pipelines donohue 2004 the presence of 0 2 mg l of cu ii increased the k bpa by 134 9 from 2 058 0 006 to 4 836 0 240 h 1 mainly attributed to the role of cu ii as an electron shuttle eq 19 by accepting e cb and transforming it to nh2cl cu ii has a higher affinity toward the g c3n4 surface and serves as a more efficient mediator than do for the electron transfer cheng et al 2020 offering an alternative pathway for the nh2cl activation to enhance the bpa degradation details in text s20 and figure s17 s18 when further increasing the cu ii concentrations to 0 5 and 1 0 mg l the k bpa gradually reached a plateau i e the k bpa increased by only 29 5 6 258 0 264 h 1 and 3 2 6 456 0 180 h 1 respectively the limited sites on the g c3n4 only allowed a certain amount of cu ii adsorbed on the surface leading to the nonlinear increase of the k bpa with a plateau at the high cu ii concentrations 19 n h 2 cl e cb cu ii n h 2 c l iron has higher concentrations in water than copper and may coexist with nh2cl the redox potential of fe iii is 0 77 v suggesting it cannot serve as the electron shuttle to accelerate the process we further verify this point by investigating the effect of fe iii on the bpa degradation by the vis420 g c3n4 nh2cl process at fe iii concentrations of 0 2 0 mg l given that fe iii concentrations in rivers are 3 0 4 0 mg l khatri et al 2017 as shown in fig 5 and fig s19 the degradation of bpa by the vis420 g c3n4 nh2cl process was not affected by the fe iii addition at 0 2 0 mg l indicating that fe iii did not perform the similar enhancing effect to cu ii 3 4 evaluation of dbp formation dbps are commonly produced from the interaction between reactive species and ubiquitous and natural organics e g nom and anthropogenic pollutants the formation of dbps during bpa degradation was evaluated by adding nom 5 mgdoc l to the vis420 g c3n4 nh2cl process and is compared with that in the uvc chlorine and uvc nh2cl processes eight dbps including chloroform tcm dichloroacetonitrile dcan trichloroacetonitrile tcan dichloroacetone dcat trichloroacetone tcat trichloronitromethane tcnm chloroacetonitrile can and trichloroacetamide tcam were measured in the process as shown in fig 5b however only four dbps i e dcan tcan tcm and tcnm were detected in the vis420 g c3n4 nh2cl process the concentrations of dcan tcan tcm and tcnm after 120 min irradiation were 0 057 0 161 0 029 and 0 017 µg l respectively which were up to 6 2 2 74 42 5 and 6 8 µg l in the uvc nh2cl process in addition the uvc chlorine process was reported to produce dcan tcm and tcnm whose concentrations were in the ranges of 10 28 27 34 and 7 5 12 5 µg l respectively chen et al 2021b li et al 2020b wu et al 2019a 2019b the concentrations of dbps formed in the vis420 g c3n4 nh2cl process are two orders of magnitudes lower compared with those produced in the uvc nh2cl or uvc chlorine processes the low dbp concentrations produced in the vis420 g c3n4 nh2cl process is because less hydrophilic precursors were produced under visible light irradiation and the produced rns had a much lower tendency than rcs to form dbps via the reactions with electron rich moieties in nom cao et al 2021 deng et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 the vis420 g c3n4 nh2cl process showed an excellent performance in controlling the dbp formation during the micropollutant degradation 4 conclusions the activation of nh2cl by visible light driven photocatalysis is a practically relevant easily implementable and environmentally friendly process to produce rns for the micropollutant degradation within the ph range of common potable water experiments and dft calculations together confirmed the production of nh2 nh2oo no and no2 via the e cb and o 2 induced activation pathways and that of nhcl and nhcloo via the h vb induced activation pathway to enhance 100 of the bpa degradation compared with the vis420 g c3n4 the vis420 g c3n4 nh2cl process allows the use of high wall plug efficiency blue light leds or even solar light to activate nh2cl and the process is less affected by aqueous components e g hco 3 and nom than the uvc nh2cl process due to the high selectivity of rns towards micropollutants the presence of low concentrations of cu ii in water will significantly accelerate the rns formation and the pollutant degradation in the process thus the combined use of visible light leds g c3n4 and nh2cl greatly extends the application scenarios of nh2cl based aops e g off grid domestic systems in addition the novel aop transformed 73 5 of the decomposed nh2cl into nitrogen containing gas suggesting that the photocatalytic nh2cl activation may potentially drive a process for ammonia removal in real water treatment through transforming ammonia into nh2cl by chlorine addition the vis420 g c3n4 nh2cl process forms much lower concentrations of dbps than the uvc chlorine or uvc nh2cl processes by replacing uvc irradiation with visible light demonstrating its excellent performances in controlling emerging environmental risk during the micropollutant degradation in addition rns was reported to destroy dna and suppressed the viable but nonculturable states and reactivation of bacteria shaw et al 2018 wang et al 2022 and thus may allow the vis420 g c3n4 nh2cl process overcome the limits of the conventional uvc or chlor am ine disinfection when inactivating pathogenic microorganisms e g escherichia coli k 12 staphylococcus aureus and spingopyxis sp bm1 1 in water declaration of competing interest the
