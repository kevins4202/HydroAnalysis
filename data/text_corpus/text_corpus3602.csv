18010,microplastics are very complex pollutants they can be made of many polymer types and exist in various shapes and sizes when they enter the environment they are affected by biotic and abiotic factors that cause their properties to change in this context the aim of our study was to evaluate the extent to which biofouling affects the properties and toxicity of microplastics cosmetic polyethylene microbeads were incubated in stream water for four weeks resulting in biofouling and aging subsequently the changes in properties sinking particle size adsorption and leaching of model metal silver and the microplastics toxicity to daphnids daphnia magna and duckweed lemna minor were evaluated pristine microplastics did not affect daphnids but they significantly affected the root growth of duckweed on the other hand reference natural particles beech sawdust did not show any negative effects we observed significant differences in the properties of aged versus pristine microplastics when compared to pristine microplastics aged microplastics adsorbed more silver and the subsequent leaching of silver was more intensive especially in the medium with an acidic ph microplastics with adsorbed silver had a high ecotoxicological potential and at environmentally relevant concentrations affected both daphnids and duckweed this study suggests that biofouling is an important parameter that affects microplastics properties pollutant adsorption and release into the environment and toxicity overall there are significant alterations of the microplastics properties behaviour and fate in the environment graphical abstract image 1 keywords adsorption biofilm leaching macrophytes microbeads metals 1 introduction in the last decade microplastic research has become far more significant due to these particles having been found practically everywhere around the globe rezania et al 2018 they have been localised in all environmental compartments in water di and wang 2018 sediment horton et al 2017 soil zhang and liu 2018 air gasperi et al 2018 in biota bellas et al 2016 and even in human food rainieri and barranco 2018 and drinking water pivokonsky et al 2018 the fragmentation of larger plastic objects in water is the main source of microplastics andrady 2011 in addition microfibers released during the washing of synthetic clothes de falco et al 2018 and microbeads from cosmetic products kalčíková et al 2017a entering into the sewage system considerably increase the concentration of microplastics in freshwaters although these microplastics end up in wastewaters and wastewater treatment plants can retain up to 98 of them the large volumes of wastewater being released into the environment can contribute up to 65 million microplastic particles a day murphy et al 2016 abrasion of various plastic coated products and abrasion from car tires also needs to be taken into account as these are a large and continuous source of micro and possibly nanoplastics kole et al 2017 the complexity of the microplastic issue lies in the complex interactions of microplastics with their surrounding environment when microplastics enter the environment they are exposed to natural processes that significantly affect their properties behaviour and fate weathering of the plastic material causes a loss of physical integrity due to the combined action of uv radiation oxidants and mechanical stresses liu et al 2020 most of the chemical changes occur at the polymers surface and can be visually observed as changes in colour and crazing of the surface acosta coley et al 2019 deeper cracks expose the inside of the plastics and promote further degradation leading to disintegration and fragmentation ter halle et al 2017 degradation of microplastics proceeds faster in comparison to larger plastics as microplastics have a higher surface to volume ratio gewert et al 2015 various microorganisms almost immediately inhabit the microplastics surface and can form a biofilm rummel et al 2017 an analysis of a microbial community attached to microplastics revealed that plastic decomposing microorganisms e g pseudomonas sp are very abundant and probably further increase the rate of microplastic degradation mccormick et al 2014 furthermore the formation of a biofilm has significant implications for the microplastics distribution in water biofilms increase the density of the microplastic particles and lead to them sinking morét ferguson et al 2010 eventually they are deposited into sediment kooi et al 2017 moreover microplastics interact with organic and inorganic components in their surrounding environment along with anthropogenic pollutants which can be adsorbed onto the microplastics surface liu et al 2019 this can be important especially for wastewaters where microplastics coexist with various pollutants enfrin et al 2019 sun et al 2019 in particular metals can be of critical importance due to their excessive abundance in wastewaters and high ecotoxicological potential hargreaves et al 2018 overall there are a multitude of processes that occur simultaneously they affect each other and alter the fate behaviour and toxicity of microplastics in this context the aim of this study was to investigate how the development of a biofilm on microplastics affects its pollutant metal adsorption characteristics and toxicity to selected aquatic organisms cosmetic polyethylene microbeads were selected as model microplastic particles because they have an irregular shape and a rough surface that can be comparable to commonly found fragments in the environment napper et al 2015 polyethylene is also one of the most abundant polymers of plastic litter morét ferguson et al 2010 due to its widespread production and its employment in single use plastics europe 2017 as a model compound for the adsorption study silver was selected due to its high ecotoxicological potential and because it has recently been detected in wastewaters and freshwaters in high concentrations due to the increased production of consumer products containing silver as an antimicrobial agent zhang et al 2016 in the last part of this study the ecotoxicity of pristine microplastics and of microplastics with a developed biofilm and adsorbed silver were evaluated and compared using duckweed lemna minor and daphnia magna these two organisms are common ecotoxicity test organisms and have previously been successfully used in the testing of microplastics eltemsah and bøhn 2019 kalčíková et al 2017b 2 materials and methods 2 1 microplastics extraction and characterisation microplastics were acquired from a proprietary body scrub 5 which is widely available for consumers it was bought in an international store polyethylene was listed among ingredients as a third component microplastics were extracted according to the procedure described by kalčíková et al 2017a around 20 ml of the body scrub was dissolved in 1000 ml of warm deionised water 50 c and then filtered via vacuum filtration using whatman filter paper pore size 4 12 μm the microplastics were washed by deionised water several times on the filter paper and then washed from the filter into glass beakers and dried overnight in a laboratory dryer kambič slovenia at 60 c the microplastics were then analysed to determine the average particle size and standard deviation using a microtrac s3500 bluewave laser diffraction particle size analyser the number of particles per mg of microplastics was calculated according to kalčíková et al 2017a the morphology of the microplastics was observed by a field emission scanning electron microscope fe sem zeiss ultra plus carl zeiss germany 2 2 development of biofilm on microplastics extracted microplastics pristine microplastics mp were exposed to simulated natural conditions by incubation in stream water containing microorganisms that can develop a biofilm on the microplastics surface aged microplastics mpbio in the experiment the stream water was replaced every week to sustain a high number of microorganisms for a period of four weeks stream water was sampled from a local stream glinščica slovenia 46 051131 14 467769 and immediately transported to the laboratory microplastics 0 15 g were added into 150 ml of stream water in an erlenmeyer flask and put to the orbital shaker at 160 rpm for one week after this period microplastics were distributed in the whole volume of the erlenmeyer flask and thus they had to be filtered out of the water via vacuum filtration using 0 45 μm mf millipore membrane filters every week 150 ml of freshly sampled stream water from the same sampling point was added to the filtered microplastics the experiment proceeded under controlled laboratory conditions at 22 2 c with a photoperiod of 16 8 h light dark at the end of the experiment four weeks the developed biofilm was immediately checked under the light microscope zeiss option axioskop camera leica dfc290 hd and zeiss axio imager germany microplastics with and without a developed biofilm were stored at 20 c for further analysis stream water was analysed for ammonium nitrogen n nh4 nitrate n no3 nitrite n no2 orthophosphate p po4 3 chlorides cl total organic carbon toc and the number of microorganisms expressed as colony forming units cfu each analysis was performed in duplicate and the standard deviation sd was calculated all measurements were validated by using reference materials and performed according to established protocols baird et al 2017 2 3 adsorption of silver onto microplastics and subsequent leaching mp and mpbio were placed 1 g l separately into a ag solution 10 mg ag l prepared from agno3 in erlenmeyer flasks the ag solution was prepared in standardised medium international organization for standardization iso medium iso 2012 which is a typical reconstructed freshwater also used as a medium for toxicity tests with daphnids explanation of the test is given in the next chapter control samples with mp and mpbio in iso medium without ag were also prepared all flasks were placed to the orbital shaker at 160 rpm for one week during the experiment the concentration of ag in the solution was monitored every second or third day afterward microplastics were removed from the solution by vacuum filtration 0 45 μm mf millipore membrane filters and washed several times with deionised water to remove the rest of the unadsorbed ag from the microplastic surface and consequently microplastics were analysed for ag content in order to evaluate the leaching of ag from microplastics 100 mg l of mp and mpbio with adsorbed ag mpag and mpbioag respectively were placed into two different types of freshwater media first was the iso medium ph 7 3 iso 2012 and the second was steinberg medium ph 5 8 typically used for the cultivation of freshwater duckweeds explanation of the test is given in the next chapter iso 2005 concentrations of ag released into the iso medium were monitored after 24 and 48 h the iso recommended duration for acute toxicity tests with daphnids while leaching of ag into steinberg medium was monitored until 168 h the total duration of the iso recommended duckweed toxicity test for the determination of the ag concentrations leached into each medium water samples were acidified with 1 hno3 and diluted 100 fold before measurements microplastics with adsorbed ag were digested using a wet digestion procedure consisting of weighing approximately 30 mg of dried sample adding 1 ml of h2so4 98 and 2 ml hno3 65 and then heating the solution using a bunsen burner until carbonisation of the samples was observed afterward 1 ml aliquots of h2o2 30 were consecutively added to the solution while it was being heated until the solution became transparent samples were quantitatively transferred into 50 ml flasks and diluted with 1 hno3 solution the ag concentration was determined by icp ms agilent 7900ce agilent technologies palo alto ca usa with the use of an internal standard the limit of detection was calculated as the concentration corresponding to a 3 fold standard deviation 3s n 6 of blank determinations results were calculated as mg of ag per l the data are presented as means n 3 with standard deviations sd 2 4 microplastics toxicity testing the impact of pristine microplastics mp aged microplastics with a biofilm mpbio pristine microplastics with adsorbed silver mpag and aged microplastics with a biofilm and adsorbed silver mpbioag on duckweed lemna minor and the water flea daphnia magna was studied duckweed l minor used in this study was cultivated under controlled laboratory conditions the toxicity test with l minor was carried out according to standard procedure iso 2005 it was conducted in 100 ml beakers filled with 50 ml of steinberg medium each type of microplastic mp mpbio mpag and mpbioag was weighed and added into a beaker to obtain concentrations of 10 and 100 mg l these concentrations were chosen based on the concentration range used in our previous study kalčíková et al 2017b control tests contained only 50 ml of steinberg medium with no addition of microplastics prior to the experiment we carefully removed the roots from each plant to ensure a similar initial condition then ten fronds five plants were placed into the beaker the experiment was performed in a climate test chamber at 24 2 c with high humidity 70 to minimize evaporation of the test medium all treatments were illuminated by daylight fluorescent lamps with a photoperiod of 16 8 h light dark the experiment proceeded for seven days and at the end of the experiment the number of fronds were counted and the lengths of roots were measured with mm paper each experiment included three replicates of the same exposure concentration and each experiment was repeated twice since pristine microplastics have previously been shown to have had a mechanical impact on the roots of duckweed kalčíková et al 2017b we also compared the ecotoxicological potential of natural particles without aging or without adsorbed ag as model natural particles we prepared beech fagus sp sawdust with similar properties as tested microplastics most of the incubation time they floated on the water s surface and the selected fraction of the beech saw dust were of a similar size to the tested microplastics confirmed by a particle size analyser they were prepared by drilling 10 mm holes in a beech wood slab the chips were then separated with standard round sieves with a 200 mm frame diameter to obtain particles with sizes above 125 μm natural particles were tested only at the highest concentration of 100 mg l but the test was performed under the same conditions as the experiment with microplastics described above toxicity tests with d magna were carried out according to standard procedure iso 2012 using daphtoxkit f magna and as described in our previous study jemec kokalj et al 2018 daphnids were pre fed with algae desmodesmus subspicatus 24 h old daphnids were exposed for 48 h at 21 1 c under a photoperiod of 16 8 h light dark controls containing only iso test medium were included in all experiments daphnids were exposed in 6 well microplates tpp switzerland each exposure included 20 daphnids four replicates with five daphnids after 48 h of exposure daphnids were inspected for immobility and their mortality was confirmed by the absence of heartbeat 2 5 data analysis the average specific growth rate over the seven days was calculated according to iso 2005 as follows 1 μ l n n j l n n i t where μ d 1 is the average specific growth rate n j is the number of fronds at the end of the experiment n i is the number of fronds at the beginning of the experiment and t d is the time period of exposure 7 days the statistical significances of the differences between the control and exposed groups were assessed by the mann whitney u test where differences were considered significant if p 0 05 using originpro 8 0 software originlab corp northampton ma usa 3 results 3 1 characterisation of microplastics and biofilm development microplastics recovered from the cosmetic product were in the form of a white powder and made of polyethylene as indicated on the cosmetic product they had an irregular shape fig 1 which is typical for many cosmetic microplastics enfrin et al 2020 kalčíková et al 2017a napper et al 2015 the mean particle size by number distribution of the pristine microplastics 180 5 118 7 μm table 1 was similar to microplastics from other cosmetic products that were previously investigated in our laboratory kalčíková et al 2017a and elsewhere e g fendall and sewell 2009 and they can be considered typical widespread cosmetic microplastics pristine microplastics were exposed weekly to water from a natural stream water parameters are given in table 2 over a period of four weeks initially upon addition of microplastics to the water the microplastics floated on the water s surface however microorganisms rapidly colonised their surface and the development of a biofilm was visible after one week the biofilm was greenish brown and formed on the microplastics surface which caused the particles to start to sink after two weeks all particles were covered by a biofilm fig 2 which significantly altered the density of the particles they were distributed throughout the solution with some also settling on the bottom the mean particle size of the aged microplastics was almost double that of the pristine microplastics while the average number of particles more than halved this could be a consequence of particle aggregation table 1 3 2 adsorption of silver onto microplastics and subsequent leaching adsorption of ag on pristine mp and aged microplastics mpbio proceeded very quickly with most of the available ag being adsorbed during the first day fig 3 however the solutions reduced ag concentration was likely not solely due to the adsorption of ag on the microplastics as the reduction of ag to ag0 is also a possibility in the flask containing mp grey pieces of reduced silver metal were visible after one day of the experiment while in flasks with mpbio no such precipitate was observed after 7 days the amount of adsorbed silver on mpbio was significantly higher than on mp 3 51 0 50 mg g and 2 44 0 22 mg g respectively the leaching experiment showed that ag quickly leached out from both types of microplastics when they were introduced into the steinberg medium while in the iso medium the leaching was minimal table 3 after 48 h only 1 and 2 of adsorbed ag had leached out into the iso medium from mpag and mpbioag respectively in all experiments more ag was leached from mpbio which was probably due to the weak adsorption of ag on the algal and bacterial biomass of the formed biofilm leaching of ag from mpbioag into the steinberg medium was almost linear with time r2 0 94 and reached 71 of the total amount of adsorbed ag on mpbio after 168 h in the case of mpag leaching was comparatively slower and after 72 h plateaued with 29 of the total amount of adsorbed ag being leached after 168 h 3 3 ecotoxicity testing of microplastics all types of microplastics pristine microplastics mp mp with developed biofilm mpbio mp and mpbio with adsorbed silver mpag and mpbioag respectively were subjected to ecotoxicological testing figs 4 and 5 results with duckweed l minor showed that both tested concentrations 10 and 100 mg l of mp and mpbio did not affect the specific growth rate of duckweed l minor fig 4 mpag and mpbioag did cause a significant decrease of the specific growth rate 36 and 44 inhibition respectively but only at the highest concentration 100 mg l the root length was affected by 100 mg l of mp fig 5 which is in accordance with our previous study kalčíková et al 2017b where we revealed that irregularly shaped microplastics with sharp edges fig 1 can decrease the root length and root cell viability of duckweed in this study we also noticed that all types of particles adhered to the duckweed roots fig 7 in the case of mpag and mpbioag the impact on roots was significant at both 10 mg l and 100 mg l of microplastics fig 5 natural particles beech sawdust had comparable properties with the pristine microplastics table 1 the mean particle size was 133 2 77 6 μm and they mainly floated on the water s surface however even at the highest concentration of 100 mg l they did not cause any measurable effect on specific growth rate or the length of roots fig 6 in the test with water fleas d magna both concentrations 10 mg l and 100 mg l of mp and mpbio did not cause any measurable effect after 48 h of incubation on the other hand both concentrations of microplastics with adsorbed ag mpag and mpbioag caused 100 inhibition of mobility of daphnids data not shown 4 discussion in the last decade microplastics have attracted increasing attention and became a very important issue due to the potential risk for the environment and human health numerous reports revealed that microplastics can interact with various anthropogenic pollutants which can be adsorbed onto the microplastics surface and transported far away microplastics can also interact and affect biota and many researchers have investigated the impact of microplastics on various marine and freshwater organisms sapea 2019 however microplastic research is often criticised for its lack of environmentally relevant data mostly in terms of type size and concentrations of tested microplastics to our knowledge this is the first study addressing how biofilm formation on microplastics affects metal adsorption and the aquatic toxicity arising from this adsorption we used microplastics extracted from a common cosmetic product also called microbeads such cosmetic microplastics are prepared by ultrafine grinding in mills wirth and korte 2009 leading to the production of fragments fig 1 that have similar properties to environmental microplastics i g irregular shape coarse surface and various sizes in comparison to designed size defined plastic spheres that are often tested despite the intensive campaign against them e g beat the microbead by plastic soup foundation and legislative measures e g microbeads free water act of 2015 microplastics can be still found in many cosmetic products for example latest recent market analysis in spain from the year 2019 showed that the majority of body and foot scrubs 63 and 80 respectively still contains polyethylene microplastics godoy et al 2019 our research along with the majority of other studies e g godoy et al 2019 napper et al 2015 found that the cosmetic products contained microplastics a few micrometers in size the most recent work by enfrin et al 2020 revealed some cosmetic products can contain nanoplastics as small as 10 nm this difference could also be caused by the inconsistency in microplastic extraction and characterisation for example in our study we used filter with a pore size of 4 μm and a laser diffraction particle size analyser while enfrin et al 2020 used a 0 22 μm filter and dynamic light scattering enfrin et al 2020 suggested that nanoplastics are aggregated and or adsorbed onto bigger particles and then subsequently released when these particles are dispersed in water after the use of such a cosmetic product microplastics and possibly nanoplastics are washed into the sewerage system leading to high amounts of cosmetic microplastics being found in wastewaters ziajahromi et al 2017 and consequently in freshwaters isobe 2016 when microplastics enter the aquatic environment they are rapidly within hours colonised by microorganisms and algae oberbeckmann et al 2015 rummel et al 2017 therefore it is plausible that pristine microplastics that are primarily used in microplastic research practically do not exist in the environment this is supported by the recent paper of mincer et al 2019 who highlighted that plastics in the environment are instantaneously colonised by a microbial biofilm and estimated that between 1 000 and 15 000 metric tons of microbial biomass are harbored on plastic marine debris as also shown in our study biofilm formation proceeded very quickly and the biofilm had an important impact on the microplastics properties and fate the most noticeable transformation was the increase in particle size table 2 that led to the sinking and sedimentation of the microplastics the wider distribution in the water body also increases the likelihood of microplastic ingestion by various organisms a biofilm can hide the plastic particles and zooplankton can easily mistake them for food vroom et al 2017 microplastics both pristine and aged without adsorbed silver were observed to have no toxic effects on daphnids at concentrations up to 100 mg l a result in accordance with previous microplastic studies jemec kokalj et al 2019 on the other hand duckweed root length was affected by pristine microplastics we previously reported the same findings kalčíková et al 2017b and at the time suggested that the shape and smoothness of the microplastics were contributing factors to the microplastics observed toxicity in this latest study we showed that irregularly shaped microplastics with sharp surface protrusions had a greater effect on the roots than smooth surfaced aged microplastics with a biofilm these findings are further corroborated by jemec kokalj et al 2019 where it was observed that microplastics that had been aged in different types of water had no effect on duckweed roots therefore it is possible that the observed abrasive effect from pristine particles fig 5 mp 100 mg l will be reduced under natural conditions besides surface roughness the material composition of particles may also play an important role this was confirmed in our experiment with beech saw dust our results showed that they did not affect the root length although they had sharp surfaces obviously the softness of the natural material wood is responsible for the lack of abrasive mechanical effects on roots in comparison to the hard polyethylene particles it is therefore important to include natural particle controls into microplastic toxicity tests to distinguish the effect of plastic particles from natural background particles furthermore both pristine and aged particles with a biofilm were attached to the roots fig 7 and fronds of duckweed similar behaviour has also been observed in various aquatic plants and macroalgae goss et al 2018 gutow et al 2016 kalčíková et al 2017b mateos cárdenas et al 2019 although not systematically investigated it is plausible that microplastics are attracted to cellulose constituents of plant cells due to the electrostatic forces and then they are additionally captured by the developed periphyton layer on plants surfaces goss et al 2018 gutow et al 2016 if this behaviour is common in nature aquatic plants may play a crucial role in the transport distribution and fate of microplastics in the aquatic environment they may also represent a route for microplastics to enter into the food web when plants with adsorbed microplastics are ingested gutow et al 2016 the presence of a developed biofilm significantly affected the adsorption of ag on the microplastics surface as microplastics with a biofilm adsorbed about 44 more ag than pristine ones this is in agreement with holmes et al 2014 who studied the adsorption of metals cd co cr cu ni pb on pristine and aged pellets under estuarine conditions and the adsorption of metals on aged particles was always greater in comparison to pristine ones the authors discussed that weathering and modification of the microplastics surface were important factors that provided a suitable and charged surface for the adsorption of various metal ions however richard et al 2019 showed that biofilms play a crucial role in microplastic metal adsorption and thus the biofilm mediated sorption needs to be taken into account together with the sorption capacity of the polymer itself leaching of metals from adsorbed microplastics has not yet been systematically investigated within the scope of microplastic research but the results of our study showed that the leaching of ag from aged particles was more intensive than pristine particles table 3 this is in agreement with kurniawan et al 2012 who investigated the sorption of various ions from lake water on biofilms and observed that ions were less intensively bound to biofilms than to ion exchange polymers and thus ions are then more easily desorbed leached from the biofilm our results also showed that the chemical properties of the medium are very important in terms of leaching in the iso medium the leaching was minimal which is likely caused by the higher ph ph 7 3 which could lead to precipitation of ag i oxide on the surface of the microplastics which is in accordance with lower solubility of ag2o reported for higher ph molleman and hiemstra 2017 steinberg medium has a ph value almost two orders of magnitude lower ph 5 8 than the iso medium which enables significantly more ag to be released into the solution presumably as hydrated ag ions and or in the form of soluble metal complexes since mp and mpbio did not cause any measurable effect on d magna and l minor except 100 mg l of mp affecting root length of l minor the observed effect of mpag and mpbioag cannot be attributed to the impact of microplastics themselves but to the leaching of adsorbed silver into the mediums this is supported by the measured concentration of silver after 168 h in the steinberg medium being 73 5 μg l and 247 5 μg l for mpag and mpbioag respectively this is in the range of a previously reported concentrations of silver that significantly affect growth rate of l minor 168hec50 81 μg l naumann et al 2007 therefore the most plausible explanation is that the negative effect of mpag and mpbioag observed in this study was caused by leached silver on the other hand the concentrations of ag leached after 48 h from mpag and mpbioag into the iso medium were very low 2 9 μg l and 6 6 μg l respectively however this was enough to cause the immobility of daphnids since these organisms are very sensitive to silver 48hec50 of ag is 2 μg l cui et al 2018 overall aged microplastics with a biofilm have the potential to adsorb a significant amount of metals and further transport them to more acidic waters where they would leach out at a much higher rate than has so far been assumed for pristine microplastics microplastics are widely distributed in the environment and their concentrations are highly heterogeneous temporally variable rodrigues et al 2018 and even within one site can fluctuate greatly dris et al 2015 environmental concentrations of microplastics are from almost zero to several thousand particles per m3 rezania et al 2018 in our study the lowest concentration of microplastics that caused an impact on tested organisms was 10 mg l of mpag and mpbioag fig 5 in the case of microplastics with a biofilm that better represent environmental microplastics than pristine ones the concentration in this study was equal to 420 particles l table 1 1 mg of mpbio contains 42 particles this concentration is close to concentrations of microplastics that have been detected lately in various freshwater environments e g 3 4 25 8 particles l in taihu lake china su et al 2016 100 particles l in amsterdam canals the netherlands leslie et al 2017 or up to 1473 3605 particles l in various water reservoirs in the czech republic pivokonsky et al 2018 5 conclusions in summary the aging of microplastics in stream water and especially the development of a biofilm significantly changes the characteristics of microplastics their distribution in test medium adsorption and desorption of silver and consequently their ecotoxicological potential the higher concentration of pristine microplastics negatively affected the roots of duckweed but biofilm development after aging negated this effect on the other hand aged microplastics adsorbed more silver that is also leached to a higher extent into medium especially if the medium has an acidic ph adsorption of ag on microplastics significantly changed their ecotoxicological potential for d magna and l minor although our laboratory research cannot be directly applied to the real environmental situation it may help to highlight the future focus of microplastic research the microplastic issue is very complex and it seems that over the last few decades of microplastic research we have just scratched the surface of the whole problem microplastics exist in many sizes shapes are made of numerous materials and their properties can change over time as they interact with other pollutants and biota as well all these parameters can affect the microplastics properties behaviour and fate therefore we need to deal with the microplastic issue in its whole complexity and try to consider all possible aspects that may affect the

18010,microplastics are very complex pollutants they can be made of many polymer types and exist in various shapes and sizes when they enter the environment they are affected by biotic and abiotic factors that cause their properties to change in this context the aim of our study was to evaluate the extent to which biofouling affects the properties and toxicity of microplastics cosmetic polyethylene microbeads were incubated in stream water for four weeks resulting in biofouling and aging subsequently the changes in properties sinking particle size adsorption and leaching of model metal silver and the microplastics toxicity to daphnids daphnia magna and duckweed lemna minor were evaluated pristine microplastics did not affect daphnids but they significantly affected the root growth of duckweed on the other hand reference natural particles beech sawdust did not show any negative effects we observed significant differences in the properties of aged versus pristine microplastics when compared to pristine microplastics aged microplastics adsorbed more silver and the subsequent leaching of silver was more intensive especially in the medium with an acidic ph microplastics with adsorbed silver had a high ecotoxicological potential and at environmentally relevant concentrations affected both daphnids and duckweed this study suggests that biofouling is an important parameter that affects microplastics properties pollutant adsorption and release into the environment and toxicity overall there are significant alterations of the microplastics properties behaviour and fate in the environment graphical abstract image 1 keywords adsorption biofilm leaching macrophytes microbeads metals 1 introduction in the last decade microplastic research has become

microbeads from cosmetic products kalčíková et al 2017a entering into the sewage system considerably increase the concentration of microplastics in freshwaters although these microplastics end up in wastewaters and wastewater treatment plants can retain up to 98 of them the large volumes of wastewater being released into the environment can contribute up to 65 million microplastic particles a day murphy et al 2016 abrasion of various plastic coated products and abrasion from car tires also needs to be taken into account as these are a large and continuous source of micro and possibly nanoplastics kole et al 2017 the complexity of the microplastic issue lies in the complex interactions of microplastics with their surrounding environment when microplastics enter the environment they are exposed to natural processes that significantly affect their properties behaviour and fate weathering of the plastic material causes a loss of physical integrity due to the combined action of uv radiation oxidants and mechanical stresses liu et al 2020 most of the chemical changes occur at the polymers surface and can be visually observed as changes in colour and crazing of the surface acosta coley et al 2019 deeper cracks expose the inside of the plastics and promote further degradation leading to disintegration and fragmentation ter halle et al 2017 degradation of microplastics proceeds faster in comparison to larger plastics as microplastics have a higher surface to volume ratio gewert et al 2015 various microorganisms almost immediately inhabit the microplastics surface and can form a biofilm rummel et al 2017 an analysis of a microbial community attached to microplastics revealed that plastic decomposing microorganisms e g pseudomonas sp are very abundant and probably further increase the rate of microplastic degradation mccormick et al 2014 furthermore the formation of a biofilm has significant implications for the microplastics distribution in water biofilms increase the density of the microplastic particles and lead to them sinking morét ferguson et al 2010 eventually they are deposited into sediment kooi et al 2017 moreover microplastics interact with organic and inorganic components in their surrounding environment along with anthropogenic pollutants which can be adsorbed onto the microplastics surface liu et al 2019 this can be important especially for wastewaters where microplastics coexist with various pollutants enfrin et al 2019 sun et al 2019 in particular metals can be of critical importance due to their excessive abundance in wastewaters and high ecotoxicological potential hargreaves et al 2018 overall there are a multitude of processes that occur simultaneously they affect each other and alter the fate behaviour and toxicity of microplastics in this context the aim of this study was to investigate how the development of a biofilm on microplastics affects its pollutant metal adsorption characteristics and toxicity to selected aquatic organisms cosmetic polyethylene microbeads were selected as model microplastic particles because they have an irregular shape and a rough surface that can be comparable to commonly found fragments in the environment napper et al 2015 polyethylene is also one of the most abundant polymers of plastic litter morét ferguson et al 2010 due to its widespread production and its employment in single use plastics europe 2017 as a model compound for the adsorption study silver was selected due to its high ecotoxicological potential and because it has recently been detected in wastewaters and freshwaters in high concentrations due to the increased production of consumer products containing silver as an antimicrobial agent zhang et al 2016 in the last part of this study the ecotoxicity of pristine microplastics and of microplastics with a developed biofilm and adsorbed silver were evaluated and compared using duckweed lemna minor and daphnia magna these two organisms are common ecotoxicity test organisms and have previously been successfully used in the testing of microplastics eltemsah and bøhn 2019 kalčíková et al 2017b 2 materials and methods 2 1 microplastics extraction and characterisation microplastics were acquired from a proprietary body scrub 5 which is widely available for consumers it was bought in an international store polyethylene was listed among ingredients as a third component microplastics were extracted according to the procedure described by kalčíková et al 2017a around 20 ml of the body scrub was dissolved in 1000 ml of warm deionised water 50 c and then filtered via vacuum filtration using whatman filter paper pore size 4 12 μm the microplastics were washed by deionised water several times on the filter paper and then washed from the filter into glass beakers and dried overnight in a laboratory dryer kambič slovenia at 60 c the microplastics were then analysed to determine the average particle size and standard deviation using a microtrac s3500 bluewave laser diffraction particle size analyser the number of particles per mg of microplastics was calculated according to kalčíková et al 2017a the morphology of the microplastics was observed by a field emission scanning electron microscope fe sem zeiss ultra plus carl zeiss germany 2 2 development of biofilm on microplastics extracted microplastics pristine microplastics mp were exposed to simulated natural conditions by incubation in stream water containing microorganisms that can develop a biofilm on the microplastics surface aged microplastics mpbio in the experiment the stream water was replaced every week to sustain a high number of microorganisms for a period of four weeks stream water was sampled from a local stream glinščica slovenia 46 051131 14 467769 and immediately transported to the laboratory microplastics 0 15 g were added into 150 ml of stream water in an erlenmeyer flask and put to the orbital shaker at 160 rpm for one week after this period microplastics were distributed in the whole volume of the erlenmeyer flask and thus they had to be filtered out of the water via vacuum filtration using 0 45 μm mf millipore membrane filters every week 150 ml of freshly sampled stream water from the same sampling point was added to the filtered microplastics the experiment proceeded under controlled laboratory conditions at 22 2 c with a photoperiod of 16 8 h light dark at the end of the experiment four weeks the developed biofilm was immediately checked under the light microscope zeiss option axioskop camera leica dfc290 hd and zeiss axio imager germany microplastics with and without a developed biofilm were stored at 20 c for further analysis stream water was analysed for ammonium nitrogen n nh4 nitrate n no3 nitrite n no2 orthophosphate p po4 3 chlorides cl total organic carbon toc and the number of microorganisms expressed as colony forming units cfu each analysis was performed in duplicate and the standard deviation sd was calculated all measurements were validated by using reference materials and performed according to established protocols baird et al 2017 2 3 adsorption of silver onto microplastics and subsequent leaching mp and mpbio were placed 1 g l separately into a ag solution 10 mg ag l prepared from agno3 in erlenmeyer flasks the ag solution was prepared in standardised medium international organization for standardization iso medium iso 2012 which is a typical reconstructed freshwater also used as a medium for toxicity tests with daphnids explanation of the test is given in the next chapter control samples with mp and mpbio in iso medium without ag were also prepared all flasks were placed to the orbital shaker at 160 rpm for one week during the experiment the concentration of ag in the solution was monitored every second or third day afterward microplastics were removed from the solution by vacuum filtration 0 45 μm mf millipore membrane filters and washed several times with deionised water to remove the rest of the unadsorbed ag from the microplastic surface and consequently microplastics were analysed for ag content in order to evaluate the leaching of ag from microplastics 100 mg l of mp and mpbio with adsorbed ag mpag and mpbioag respectively were placed into two different types of freshwater media first was the iso medium ph 7 3 iso 2012 and the second was steinberg medium ph 5 8 typically used for the cultivation of freshwater duckweeds explanation of the test is given in the next chapter iso 2005 concentrations of ag released into the iso medium were monitored after 24 and 48 h the iso recommended duration for acute toxicity tests with daphnids while leaching of ag into steinberg medium was monitored until 168 h the total duration of the iso recommended duckweed toxicity test for the determination of the ag concentrations leached into each medium water samples were acidified with 1 hno3 and diluted 100 fold before measurements microplastics with adsorbed ag were digested using a wet digestion procedure consisting of weighing approximately 30 mg of dried sample adding 1 ml of h2so4 98 and 2 ml hno3 65 and then heating the solution using a bunsen burner until carbonisation of the samples was observed afterward 1 ml aliquots of h2o2 30 were consecutively added to the solution while it was being heated until the solution became transparent samples were quantitatively transferred into 50 ml flasks and diluted with 1 hno3 solution the ag concentration was determined by icp ms agilent 7900ce agilent technologies palo alto ca usa with the use of an internal standard the limit of detection was calculated as the concentration corresponding to a 3 fold standard deviation 3s n 6 of blank determinations results were calculated as mg of ag per l the data are presented as means n 3 with standard deviations sd 2 4 microplastics toxicity testing the impact of pristine microplastics mp aged microplastics with a biofilm mpbio pristine microplastics with adsorbed silver mpag and aged microplastics with a biofilm and adsorbed silver mpbioag on duckweed lemna minor and the water flea daphnia magna was studied duckweed l minor used in this study was cultivated under controlled laboratory conditions the toxicity test with l minor was carried out according to standard procedure iso 2005 it was conducted in 100 ml beakers filled with 50 ml of steinberg medium each type of microplastic mp mpbio mpag and mpbioag was weighed and added into a beaker to obtain concentrations of 10 and 100 mg l these concentrations were chosen based on the concentration range used in our previous study kalčíková et al 2017b control tests contained only 50 ml of steinberg medium with no addition of microplastics prior to the experiment we carefully removed the roots from each plant to ensure a similar initial condition then ten fronds five plants were placed into the beaker the experiment was performed in a climate test chamber at 24 2 c with high humidity 70 to minimize evaporation of the test medium all treatments were illuminated by daylight fluorescent lamps with a photoperiod of 16 8 h light dark the experiment proceeded for seven days and at the end of the experiment the number of fronds were counted and the lengths of roots were measured with mm paper each experiment included three replicates of the same exposure concentration and each experiment was repeated twice since pristine microplastics have previously been shown to have had a mechanical impact on the roots of duckweed kalčíková et al 2017b we also compared the ecotoxicological potential of natural particles without aging or without adsorbed ag as model natural particles we prepared beech fagus sp sawdust with similar properties as tested microplastics most of the incubation time they floated on the water s surface and the selected fraction of the beech saw dust were of a similar size to the tested microplastics confirmed by a particle size analyser they were prepared by drilling 10 mm holes in a beech wood slab the chips were then separated with standard round sieves with a 200 mm frame diameter to obtain particles with sizes above 125 μm natural particles were tested only at the highest concentration of 100 mg l but the test was performed under the same conditions as the experiment with microplastics described above toxicity tests with d magna were carried out according to standard procedure iso 2012 using daphtoxkit f magna and as described in our previous study jemec kokalj et al 2018 daphnids were pre fed with algae desmodesmus subspicatus 24 h old daphnids were exposed for 48 h at 21 1 c under a photoperiod of 16 8 h light dark controls containing only iso test medium were included in all experiments daphnids were exposed in 6 well microplates tpp switzerland each exposure included 20 daphnids four replicates with five daphnids after 48 h of exposure daphnids were inspected for immobility and their mortality was confirmed by the absence of heartbeat 2 5 data analysis the average specific growth rate over the seven days was calculated according to iso 2005 as follows 1 μ l n n j l n n i t where μ d 1 is the average specific growth rate n j is the number of fronds at the end of the experiment n i is the number of fronds at the beginning of the experiment and t d is the time period of exposure 7 days the statistical significances of the differences between the control and exposed groups were assessed by the mann whitney u test where differences were considered significant if p 0 05 using originpro 8 0 software originlab corp northampton ma usa 3 results 3 1 characterisation of microplastics and biofilm development microplastics recovered from the cosmetic product were in the form of a white powder and made of polyethylene as indicated on the cosmetic product they had an irregular shape fig 1 which is typical for many cosmetic microplastics enfrin et al 2020 kalčíková et al 2017a napper et al 2015 the mean particle size by number distribution of the pristine microplastics 180 5 118 7 μm table 1 was similar to microplastics from other cosmetic products that were previously investigated in our laboratory kalčíková et al 2017a and elsewhere e g fendall and sewell 2009 and they can be considered typical widespread cosmetic microplastics pristine microplastics were exposed weekly to water from a natural stream water parameters are given in table 2 over a period of four weeks initially upon addition of microplastics to the water the microplastics floated on the water s surface however microorganisms rapidly colonised their surface and the development of a biofilm was visible after one week the biofilm was greenish brown and formed on the microplastics surface which caused the particles to start to sink after two weeks all particles were covered by a biofilm fig 2 which significantly altered the density of the particles they were distributed throughout the solution with some also settling on the bottom the mean particle size of the aged microplastics was almost double that of the pristine microplastics while the average number of particles more than halved this could be a consequence of particle aggregation table 1 3 2 adsorption of silver onto microplastics and subsequent leaching adsorption of ag on pristine mp and aged microplastics mpbio proceeded very quickly with most of the available ag being adsorbed during the first day fig 3 however the solutions reduced ag concentration was likely not solely due to the adsorption of ag on the microplastics as the reduction of ag to ag0 is also a possibility in the flask containing mp grey pieces of reduced silver metal were visible after one day of the experiment while in flasks with mpbio no such precipitate was observed after 7 days the amount of adsorbed silver on mpbio was significantly higher than on mp 3 51 0 50 mg g and 2 44 0 22 mg g respectively the leaching experiment showed that ag quickly leached out from both types of microplastics when they were introduced into the steinberg medium while in the iso medium the leaching was minimal table 3 after 48 h only 1 and 2 of adsorbed ag had leached out into the iso medium from mpag and mpbioag respectively in all experiments more ag was leached from mpbio which was probably due to the weak adsorption of ag on the algal and bacterial biomass of the formed biofilm leaching of ag from mpbioag into the steinberg medium was almost linear with time r2 0 94 and reached 71 of the total amount of adsorbed ag on mpbio after 168 h in the case of mpag leaching was comparatively slower and after 72 h plateaued with 29 of the total amount of adsorbed ag being leached after 168 h 3 3 ecotoxicity testing of microplastics all types of microplastics pristine microplastics mp mp with developed biofilm mpbio mp and mpbio with adsorbed silver mpag and mpbioag respectively were subjected to ecotoxicological testing figs 4 and 5 results with duckweed l minor showed that both tested concentrations 10 and 100 mg l of mp and mpbio did not affect the specific growth rate of duckweed l minor fig 4 mpag and mpbioag did cause a significant decrease of the specific growth rate 36 and 44 inhibition respectively but only at the highest concentration 100 mg l the root length was affected by 100 mg l of mp fig 5 which is in accordance with our previous study kalčíková et al 2017b where we revealed that irregularly shaped microplastics with sharp edges fig 1 can decrease the root length and root cell viability of duckweed in this study we also noticed that all types of particles adhered to the duckweed roots fig 7 in the case of mpag and mpbioag the impact on roots was significant at both 10 mg l and 100 mg l of microplastics fig 5 natural particles beech sawdust had comparable properties with the pristine microplastics table 1 the mean particle size was 133 2 77 6 μm and they mainly floated on the water s surface however even at the highest concentration of 100 mg l they did not cause any measurable effect on specific growth rate or the length of roots fig 6 in the test with water fleas d magna both concentrations 10 mg l and 100 mg l of mp and mpbio did not cause any measurable effect after 48 h of incubation on the other hand both concentrations of microplastics with adsorbed ag mpag and mpbioag caused 100 inhibition of mobility of daphnids data not shown 4 discussion in the last decade microplastics have attracted increasing attention and became a very important issue due to the potential risk for the environment and human health numerous reports revealed that microplastics can interact with various anthropogenic pollutants which can be adsorbed onto the microplastics surface and transported far away microplastics can also interact and affect biota and many researchers have investigated the impact of microplastics on various marine and freshwater organisms sapea 2019 however microplastic research is often criticised for its lack of environmentally relevant data mostly in terms of type size and concentrations of tested microplastics to our knowledge this is the first study addressing how biofilm formation on microplastics affects metal adsorption and the aquatic toxicity arising from this adsorption we used microplastics extracted from a common cosmetic product also called microbeads such cosmetic microplastics are prepared by ultrafine grinding in mills wirth and korte 2009 leading to the production of fragments fig 1 that have similar properties to environmental microplastics i g irregular shape coarse surface and various sizes in comparison to designed size defined plastic spheres that are often tested despite the intensive campaign against them e g beat the microbead by plastic soup foundation and legislative measures e g microbeads free water act of 2015 microplastics can be still found in many cosmetic products for example latest recent market analysis in spain from the year 2019 showed that the majority of body and foot scrubs 63 and 80 respectively still contains polyethylene microplastics godoy et al 2019 our research along with the majority of other studies e g godoy et al 2019 napper et al 2015 found that the cosmetic products contained microplastics a few micrometers in size the most recent work by enfrin et al 2020 revealed some cosmetic products can contain nanoplastics as small as 10 nm this difference could also be caused by the inconsistency in microplastic extraction and characterisation for example in our study we used filter with a pore size of 4 μm and a laser diffraction particle size analyser while enfrin et al 2020 used a 0 22 μm filter and dynamic light scattering enfrin et al 2020 suggested that nanoplastics are aggregated and or adsorbed onto bigger particles and then subsequently released when these particles are dispersed in water after the use of such a cosmetic product microplastics and possibly nanoplastics are washed into the sewerage system leading to high amounts of cosmetic microplastics being found in wastewaters ziajahromi et al 2017 and consequently in freshwaters isobe 2016 when microplastics enter the aquatic environment they are rapidly within hours colonised by microorganisms and algae oberbeckmann et al 2015 rummel et al 2017 therefore it is plausible that pristine microplastics that are primarily used in microplastic research practically do not exist in the environment this is supported by the recent paper of mincer et al 2019 who highlighted that plastics in the environment are instantaneously colonised by a microbial biofilm and estimated that between 1 000 and 15 000 metric tons of microbial biomass are harbored on plastic marine debris as also shown in our study biofilm formation proceeded very quickly and the biofilm had an important impact on the microplastics properties and fate the most noticeable transformation was the increase in particle size table 2 that led to the sinking and sedimentation of the microplastics the wider distribution in the water body also increases the likelihood of microplastic ingestion by various organisms a biofilm can hide the plastic particles and zooplankton can easily mistake them for food vroom et al 2017 microplastics both pristine and aged without adsorbed silver were observed to have no toxic effects on daphnids at concentrations up to 100 mg l a result in accordance with previous microplastic studies jemec kokalj et al 2019 on the other hand duckweed root length was affected by pristine microplastics we previously reported the same findings kalčíková et al 2017b and at the time suggested that the shape and smoothness of the microplastics were contributing factors to the microplastics observed toxicity in this latest study we showed that irregularly shaped microplastics with sharp surface protrusions had a greater effect on the roots than smooth surfaced aged microplastics with a biofilm these findings are further corroborated by jemec kokalj et al 2019 where it was observed that microplastics that had been aged in different types of water had no effect on duckweed roots therefore it is possible that the observed abrasive effect from pristine particles fig 5 mp 100 mg l will be reduced under natural conditions besides surface roughness the material composition of particles may also play an important role this was confirmed in our experiment with beech saw dust our results showed that they did not affect the root length although they had sharp surfaces obviously the softness of the natural material wood is responsible for the lack of abrasive mechanical effects on roots in comparison to the hard polyethylene particles it is therefore important to include natural particle controls into microplastic toxicity tests to distinguish the effect of plastic particles from natural background particles furthermore both pristine and aged particles with a biofilm were attached to the roots fig 7 and fronds of duckweed similar behaviour has also been observed in various aquatic plants and macroalgae goss et al 2018 gutow et al 2016 kalčíková et al 2017b mateos cárdenas et al 2019 although not systematically investigated it is plausible that microplastics are attracted to cellulose constituents of plant cells due to the electrostatic forces and then they are additionally captured by the developed periphyton layer on plants surfaces goss et al 2018 gutow et al 2016 if this behaviour is common in nature aquatic plants may play a crucial role in the transport distribution and fate of microplastics in the aquatic environment they may also represent a route for microplastics to enter into the food web when plants with adsorbed microplastics are ingested gutow et al 2016 the presence of a developed biofilm significantly affected the adsorption of ag on the microplastics surface as microplastics with a biofilm adsorbed about 44 more ag than pristine ones this is in agreement with holmes et al 2014 who studied the adsorption of metals cd co cr cu ni pb on pristine and aged pellets under estuarine conditions and the adsorption of metals on aged particles was always greater in comparison to pristine ones the authors discussed that weathering and modification of the microplastics surface were important factors that provided a suitable and charged surface for the adsorption of various metal ions however richard et al 2019 showed that biofilms play a crucial role in microplastic metal adsorption and thus the biofilm mediated sorption needs to be taken into account together with the sorption capacity of the polymer itself leaching of metals from adsorbed microplastics has not yet been systematically investigated within the scope of microplastic research but the results of our study showed that the leaching of ag from aged particles was more intensive than pristine particles table 3 this is in agreement with kurniawan et al 2012 who investigated the sorption of various ions from lake water on biofilms and observed that ions were less intensively bound to biofilms than to ion exchange polymers and thus ions are then more easily desorbed leached from the biofilm our results also showed that the chemical properties of the medium are very important in terms of leaching in the iso medium the leaching was minimal which is likely caused by the higher ph ph 7 3 which could lead to precipitation of ag i oxide on the surface of the microplastics which is in accordance with lower solubility of ag2o reported for higher ph molleman and hiemstra 2017 steinberg medium has a ph value almost two orders of magnitude lower ph 5 8 than the iso medium which enables significantly more ag to be released into the solution presumably as hydrated ag ions and or in the form of soluble metal complexes since mp and mpbio did not cause any measurable effect on d magna and l minor except 100 mg l of mp affecting root length of l minor the observed effect of mpag and mpbioag cannot be attributed to the impact of microplastics themselves but to the leaching of adsorbed silver into the mediums this is supported by the measured concentration of silver after 168 h in the steinberg medium being 73 5 μg l and 247 5 μg l for mpag and mpbioag respectively this is in the range of a previously reported concentrations of silver that significantly affect growth rate of l minor 168hec50 81 μg l naumann et al 2007 therefore the most plausible explanation is that the negative effect of mpag and mpbioag observed in this study was caused by leached silver on the other hand the concentrations of ag leached after 48 h from mpag and mpbioag into the iso medium were very low 2 9 μg l and 6 6 μg l respectively however this was enough to cause the immobility of daphnids since these organisms are very sensitive to silver 48hec50 of ag is 2 μg l cui et al 2018 overall aged microplastics with a biofilm have the potential to adsorb a significant amount of metals and further transport them to more acidic waters where they would leach out at a much higher rate than has so far been assumed for pristine microplastics microplastics are widely distributed in the environment and their concentrations are highly heterogeneous temporally variable rodrigues et al 2018 and even within one site can fluctuate greatly dris et al 2015 environmental concentrations of microplastics are from almost zero to several thousand particles per m3 rezania et al 2018 in our study the lowest concentration of microplastics that caused an impact on tested organisms was 10 mg l of mpag and mpbioag fig 5 in the case of microplastics with a biofilm that better represent environmental microplastics than pristine ones the concentration in this study was equal to 420 particles l table 1 1 mg of mpbio contains 42 particles this concentration is close to concentrations of microplastics that have been detected lately in various freshwater environments e g 3 4 25 8 particles l in taihu lake china su et al 2016 100 particles l in amsterdam canals the netherlands leslie et al 2017 or up to 1473 3605 particles l in various water reservoirs in the czech republic pivokonsky et al 2018 5 conclusions in summary the aging of microplastics in stream water and especially the development of a biofilm significantly changes the characteristics of microplastics their distribution in test medium adsorption and desorption of silver and consequently their ecotoxicological potential the higher concentration of pristine microplastics negatively affected the roots of duckweed but biofilm development after aging negated this effect on the other hand aged microplastics adsorbed more silver that is also leached to a higher extent into medium especially if the medium has an acidic ph adsorption of ag on microplastics significantly changed their ecotoxicological potential for d magna and l minor although our laboratory research cannot be directly applied to the real environmental situation it may help to highlight the future focus of microplastic research the microplastic issue is very complex and it seems that over the last few decades of microplastic research we have just scratched the surface of the whole problem microplastics exist in many sizes shapes are made of numerous materials and their properties can change over time as they interact with other pollutants and biota as well all these parameters can affect the microplastics properties behaviour and fate therefore we need to deal with the microplastic issue in its whole complexity and try to consider all possible aspects that may affect the

18011,although there are numerous studies concerning the occurrence of microplastics mp in the environment and its impact on the ecosystem dissolved organic matter dom leached from mp mp dom has received little attention and its characteristics have been rarely examined it is presumed that the dom leaching from plastics could be accelerated when plastics lost their protective additives during their transport and weathering processes in aquatic systems in this study two additive free mps or micro sized plastic polymers were leached in artificial freshwater under uv irradiation and dark conditions the leached dom was characterized by typical analyses for naturally occurring dom n dom such as dissolved organic carbon doc size exclusion chromatography sec and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir the potential to generate trihalomethanes thms a well known environmental impact of n dom was also explored for the dom with plastic origins for the first time the leaching results demonstrated that uv irradiation promoted the leaching of dom from the plastic polymers with an amount corresponding to 3 of the total mass of the polymers the leached amounts were much greater than those previously reported using commercial plastics which presumably contained protective additives the sec results revealed that different from typical aquatic n dom mp dom is mostly composed of low molecular weight fractions 350 da for the two polymer types polyethylene and polypropylene the mp dom exhibited a high potential to form thms upon chlorination which was comparable to those of typical aquatic n dom this study highlighted an overlooked contribution of uv irradiation to the dom leaching from additive free plastics and the potential risk of mp dom to produce toxic disinfection byproducts dbps upon chlorination graphical abstract image 1 keywords microplastics dissolved organic matter polymers molecular size distribution trihalomethanes thms 1 introduction the massive production of plastics poses serious risks for the environment and the global ecosystems due to the limited recycling and improper disposal approximately 270 000 tons of plastics and more than 5 trillion plastic pieces are currently floating in the world s oceans eriksen et al 2014 during its transport to the ocean through rivers or coastal systems most disposed plastics are subjected to natural abiotic degradation processes involving chemical and mechanical reactions which are collectively called weathering leading to the fragmentation of the plastics weinstein et al 2016 song et al 2017 plastic particles with the size of 5 mm the so called microplastics mps have received tremendous attention in recent years law and thompson 2014 jambeck et al 2015 siegfried et al 2017 these small sized plastic debris are ubiquitous in natural aquatic systems such as freshwater coastal systems and open oceans wagner et al 2014 eerkes medrano et al 2015 su et al 2016 alimi et al 2018 li et al 2018 as well as in water treatment facilities mason et al 2016 in addition to the main polymer chains commercial plastics commonly contain various types of plasticizers and or antioxidants termed additives that protect the principal polymeric chain from breakdown caused by irradiation and weathering the additives also help to improve the product quality like ductility and structural stability it was previously reported that when plastics are in long contact with water the additives plus the oligomers or monomers from the main polymer chains could be released to the aquatic media suhrhoff and scholz böttcher 2016 furthermore with the progress of the fragmentation of plastics the more production of such nano sized materials and the more leaching of dissolved organic substances from plastics could occur lambert and wagner 2016 chemical modifications promoted by uv irradiation may produce structural damage to plastic materials accelerating the release of dissolved organic compounds i e additives and or polymer derived organic substances potthoff et al 2017 previous studies have demonstrated the vulnerable property of polymer chains containing low or zero amount of antioxidant additives by tracking the changes in the infrared spectra of the plastic after photo oxidation gardette et al 2013 or through the mechanical tension test ojeda et al 2011 to date most mp studies have focused on particle counting without paying much attention to its potential leaching capacity romera castillo et al 2018 have provided a new insight into the overlooked phenomenon by demonstrating that substantial amounts of dissolved organic matter dom were leached from mps in ambient seawater it is easily presumed that microplastic derived dom mp dom can be widespread in natural and engineered aquatic systems while much still remains unknown about the characteristics of the leached dom and the environmental impacts it was previously reported that a substantial amount 65 million particles per day of mps were released from one treatment facility through effluent water everyday murphy et al 2016 moreover there is a possibility that the actual occurrence of mp dom could be more pronounced than presumed from the observed number of the mp particles remaining in treatment facilities because weathering of mps followed by the release of dom might already take place prior to the removal of mp particles in the treatment systems chlorine is the most widely used disinfection agent in water treatment processes around the world due to its high effectiveness and affordability for the control of pathogens many wastewater treatment plants operate a chlorine disinfection treatment prior to the final discharge krasner et al 2008 however the formation of toxic disinfection byproducts dbps following chlorination of treated water wastewater is an unavoidable consequence and arguably constitutes one of the most critical risks of dom to aquatic ecosystems and human health while the dbp formation potentials of naturally occurring dom n dom from different origins have been much studied and well documented wang et al 2017 zhai et al 2017 no effort has been made to examine the potential of mp dom to form dbps upon chlorination in addition considering that mp dom co exist with n dom in the aquatic environment it is an intriguing question whether or not mp dom would behave similarly with aquatic n dom in terms of dbp formation potential to answer all the questions this study aimed at characterizing the dom leached from mp polymers under different environmental settings and the formation potential of dbps to the best of the authors knowledge there has not been any previous study that examined the dom derived from additive free mps i e mp polymers the specific tasks of this study were to 1 compare the amounts of dom leached from mp polymers under dark and uv irradiation conditions 2 characterize the mp dom using the analytical tools for n dom including fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir and size exclusion chromatography with organic carbon detection sec ocd and 3 explore the possibility of mp dom serving as a precursor of trihalomethanes thms upon chlorination 2 materials and methods 2 1 microplastic polymers two types of plastic polymers or additive free plastics were used for this study they are based on polyethylene pe and polypropylene pp materials which were obtained from sigma aldrich and polyscience companies asia pacific inc taiwan branch respectively two particle sizes were selected for each mp polymer as 40 48 μm for pe and 25 85 μm for pp the choice of the plastic polymers used in this study is based on the previous report of the highest consumption discharge rate in the world geyer et al 2017 pe 36 pp 21 furthermore the two materials have been widely used in the refined forms for many polymer studies beckingham and ghosh 2017 paço et al 2017 2 2 microplastic polymer leaching experiments three different factors which might affect the leached amounts of dom from the two polymers were taken into account for the leaching experiments they were i the mass of mp per water volume 0 1 2 0 g mp l 1 ii contact time with water or leaching time 1 h 14 days and iii uv irradiation the applied amounts of the plastic polymers which are expressed by the mass per water volume were referred to the observed ranges previously reported in relevant studies suhrhoff and scholz böttcher 2016 since this study aimed to characterize the dom leached from plastic polymers the added amounts of mp were intentionally designed to be higher than the values reported in natural water environment alimi et al 2018 for the experiments an aqueous solution was prepared to have the ion composition similar to a typical freshwater which consists of nahco3 96 mg l 1 caso4 47 4 mg l 1 mgso4 7h2o 122 86 mg l 1 and kcl 4 mg l 1 according to the u s environmental protection agency epa protocol epa 821 r 02 013 edition 2002 the mp polymers were added in powder like form to 50 ml of the artificial freshwater in sterilized glass vials n 237 which were autoclaved at 120 c for 15 min the vials were placed in the dark on a shaker at 150 rpm and each vial was sacrificed for sampling at designated contact times during the 14 days of the leaching test controls were also prepared following the same procedure without the addition of the polymers the mixing solution with the suspended particles was filtered through a pre ashed whatman gf f filter to obtain the mp dom in the filtration step a glassware vacuum filtration device was used instead of a syringe filter to minimize further contact with other plastic materials all the experiments were performed in triplicate for a uv irradiation setup 50 ml of the artificial freshwater solution containing 50 mg of pe or pp polymers with 100 μm particle diameter were prepared in 14 autoclaved cylindrical quartz tubes 125 ml with an inner diameter of 4 5 cm and a height of 8 cm a stirrer was placed in the bottom of each quartz tube to achieve continual mixing throughout the 14 day leaching test the tubes were placed in the middle of a close cabinet surrounded inside by six 8w uva lamps with the characteristic wavelengths at 320 400 nm sankyo denki f8t5bl as light sources fig s1 the light intensity in the closed cabinet was equivalent to that of natural solar light at noon time in may seoul south korea lee et al 2018b which was approximately 4000 μw cm 2 based on an ultraviolet uv meter model 850009 sper scientific the reactor temperature was maintained at 25 3 c by circulating cooling air with fans attached to the system phong and hur 2015 2 3 analytical measurements 2 3 1 ftir spectroscopy fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir nicolet is10 thermo scientific was used to confirm the mp origins of the dom samples obtained from the leaching experiments the ftir analysis for this study was based on the procedure previously described in chen et al 2018 briefly 10 ml of the filtered dom sample was mixed with 100 mg of kbr powder sigma aldrich ft ir grade and freeze dried for further analysis as a blank clean kbr pellets were prepared after a drying step at 105 c for 2 h the blank was corrected with a clean kbr pellet and the scanned wavenumber range was set at 650 to 4000 cm 1 each ftir spectrum was corrected for baseline shifts and was smoothed using origin 9 0 software 12 point savitzky golay method ftir peak intensities were normalized by the summed value of all peaks yang et al

molecular weight acids lmwa and low molecular weight neutrals lmwn were based on an established procedure huber et al 2011 and the in built software the sec analysis was performed on one representative sample for the three replicates 2 4 trihalomethanes formation potential thmfp measurement for mp dom the trihalomethanes thm formation potentials thmfp of mp dom samples were determined following the standard methods 5710b 6232b and 6251b but with some modifications lee et al 2018a the mp dom samples obtained under uv irradiation condition were diluted with ultrapure water to have a constant doc concentration i e 1 mg c l 1 while those under dark condition were used as they were because of the low concentrations the ph was adjusted to 7 0 with the addition of 1 ml of phosphate buffer per 50 ml of sample chlorination was performed by adding sodium hypochlorite to the dom samples to achieve a sufficient chlorine dosage naocl sigma aldrich 6 14 available chlorine of 5 mg cl2

species were extracted using liquid liquid extraction based on methyl tert butyl ether with 1 3 dipromoprophane 200 μg l 1 added as an internal standard the concentrations of extracted thms were determined using a gas chromatography agilent 7890a usa with a micro electron capture detector in accordance with modified versions of us epa methods 551 1 and 552 3 following the method described in park et al 2016 3 results and discussion 3 1 identification of the origins of mp dom infrared spectroscopy is a proven and reliable analytical technique for identifying the polymeric composition of mps gorassini et al 2016 jung et al 2018 the two mp polymers used in this study presented distinct spectral features with the appearance of a b c and f peaks for pe and a b c d and e peaks for pp in the ftir spectra fig 1 a and table s1 a b and c peaks which originate from the carbon chains of repeating ch2 units were commonly observed for the spectra of both mp polymers meanwhile structural differences were found between pe and pp which were characterized by the exclusive presence of d i e ch3 band and f i e ch2 rock band peaks for pp and pe respectively the ftir spectra of the dom samples from leaching experiments evidenced the origins of the two mp polymers fig 1 and s2 regardless of the polymer type the c h bands were observed in the dom samples with a slight increasing trend of the peak intensity with leaching time under the dark condition fig 1b d the same approach using ftir spectra for the identification of mp dom has been adopted in a previous study using polymer powders jung et al 2018 for this study unlike the polymers presenting distinct spectral features between pe and pp the mp dom did not exhibit any obvious difference between the ir spectra of the two polymer types these results indicate that the carbon structures of the mp dom might be similar despite the different plastic origins or polymer types according to a previous report on the photo chemically induced oxidation of polyolefin bracco et al 2018 uv irradiation is likely to induce various modifications on polymer structures such as cross linking chain branching and oxidative degradation in this study peaks a b and c were observed in the mp dom samples after uv irradiation as well as in the dark treatments even though the peaks were less prominent than those in the dark the most striking difference in the ftir spectra between the two treatments was the unique appearance of peak g consisting of the vinyl unsaturated bands at 973 and 996 cm 1 in the irradiated samples peak g showed an increasing trend with irradiation time indicative of its association with uv irradiation the observation can be attributed to the generation of photolytic byproducts from the mp polymers by photochemical cleavage fig 1c e or the so called norrish reactions gardette et al 2013 however there were no notable changes in the range of double bonds h peak 1640 1780 cm 1 ketones carboxylic acids esters and lactones of the mp dom along the irradiation time even though the bands have been reported to be related to typical routes of the norrish reactions figs s2b and s2d gardette et al 2013 bracco et al 2018 further studies are warranted to examine the exact photochemical reactions involving the dom leaching under uv irradiation 3 2 factors affecting the amounts of mp dom 3 2 1 effects of mp dose polymer type and leaching time dom leaching behavior under dark condition was evaluated in terms of mp concentration and different polymer types fig s3 the released dom amounts showed a general increasing trend with a higher dose of plastic for example the doc concentrations of the mp dom changed from 66 5 to 390 4 μg c l 1 with increasing dose from 0 1 g l 1 to 2 0 g l 1 of the pe polymer after 7 days of leaching the enhancing effect of mp dose on dom leaching was further supported by the significant correlations between the doc concentrations and the doses of the mp polymers with the r 2 values of 0 871 p 0 001 n 20 for pe and 0 784 p 0 001 n 20 for pp fig s3 the average released amounts of mp dom after 7 days of leaching were 368 17 μg c g 1 for pe n 10 and 93 4 μg c g 1 n 10 for pp in doc per gram of polymers which were equivalent to 0 03 of the total mass of the mp polymers used although the leached amount is very small per mps it cannot be neglected considering the tremendous occurrence of mps in the aquatic environments romera castillo et al 2018 have reported that globally up to 23 600 metric tons of doc might be leached from plastic entering the ocean per year meanwhile the released doc concentrations from pe i e pe dom was nearly four times higher than those from pp i e pp dom at all polymer doses fig s3 suggesting the dom leaching concentrations are highly dependent upon the polymer types the pe chains appear to be more vulnerable in a water environment than the pp chains this trend agreed well with a previous report romera castillo et al 2018 in which low density pe ldpe and high density pe hdpe released higher concentrations of doc between 2 79 and 8 92 μg c cm 2 than pp 1 61 μg c cm 2 in the dark for both polymer types leaching time or contact time was not likely to be a critical factor to influence the amounts of mp dom released since no significant difference paired t test p 0 07 n 40 were observed in the leached doc concentrations after an instantaneous contact with water versus a 7 days contact for example the instantaneously leached doc concentrations were equivalent to 84 90 of the total amounts leached after 7 days fig s3 the same trend was also reported in a previous study romera castillo et al 2018 which demonstrated that instantaneously leached dom amounts from commercial plastics corresponded to 60 26 of those after 7 days in some cases the immediately released doc concentration was even higher than that observed after 7 days of leaching e g 302 8 μg c l 1 versus 226 1 μg c l 1 when 1 g of the pe polymer per liter was used the reversed doc concentration trend for longer time of contact between mps and water might be explained by the adsorption of the initially released doc onto the surface of the mps bakir et al 2014 curran and strlič 2015 3 2 2 effect of uv irradiation in contrast to the dark treatment changes in the mp dom concentrations with leaching time was more obvious and dramatic under uv irradiation fig 2 which indicates the stimulating effect of uv light on the production of mp dom from the two polymers after 14 days of irradiation the doc concentrations of the mp dom became nearly 100 times greater than those under the dark condition fig 2a versus 2b suggesting that uv irradiation might play a role in changing the mp polymers into more vulnerable structures to dissolution the released amounts of mp dom after 7 days of leaching were 22 8 mg c g 1 for pe and 42 1 mg c g 1 for pp in doc per gram of polymers which were equivalent to an average of 3 2 of the total mass of the mp polymers similar structural instability of the polymer materials under uv light was previously reported in a study that documented substantial changes in the ir spectra of polymer film after direct uv irradiation gardette et al 2013 for this study the additional mp dom leaching upon uv irradiation was more pronounced for the pp versus the pe polymer with the leached concentrations corresponding to 42 1 mg c l 1 pp dom versus 22 9 mg c l 1 pe dom at the end of the irradiation i e 14 days song et al 2017 also demonstrated the similar trend in the fragmentation of plastics establishing a higher rate for pp versus pe materials under uv exposure lasting for 12 months the difference was attributed to the presence of alkyl groups on the pp polymer as alkyl radicals are more likely to be formed from the polymers with longer alkyl chains under uv irradiation aslanzadeh and haghighat kish 2010 rajakumar et al 2012 it is notable that such a uv irradiation stimulated mp dom leaching was not previously reported for additive containing plastics suhrhoff and scholz böttcher 2016 it is likely that the antioxidants serving as the main component of the additives in commercial plastics might protect the basic polymer chains from being broken down by the uv light the accelerated mp dom leaching under uv irradiation in this study strongly imply that the absence or partial loss of additives from mps could promote the production of mp dom in aquatic systems under uv irradiation since commercial plastics contain 20 additives on average which constitutes 1 60 of the total mass of the plastic material bilitewski et al 2012 the released amounts of mp dom per mass of plastic could be highly variable across different types of plastics 3 3 molecular size characteristics of mp dom three different size fractions were identified in the mp dom from the polymers fig 3 which included operationally defined hs bb lmwa and lmwn size fractions irrespective of the polymer type and the experimental conditions i e dark light lmwn 350 da was the predominant fraction constituting 61 87 of the total leached dom fig s5 this observation was in contrast with a typical pattern of aquatic n dom characterized by a lower distribution of lmwn suwannee river nom 14 paldang lake 38 han river 29 versus hs fraction fig s4 the sec result of the mp dom was in line with a previous study using mass spectroscopy that detected the occurrence of homogeneous n alkanes between c 12 and c 32 in an aqueous phase when commercial pe was placed in contact with water suhrhoff and scholz böttcher 2016 these chains represent low molecular weight oligomers simoneit et al 2005 under uv irradiation the concentrations of all identified size fractions increased with the irradiation time for both pp dom and pe dom fig 3e and f the most pronounced increasing trend was observed in the lmwn fraction which led to changes in the proportion of the lmwn from 61 to 80 for pe dom and from 77 to 87 for pp dom over 14 days of leaching correspondingly the larger molecular size fraction i e hs bb exhibited slowly decreasing trends in their relative abundance with irradiation time figs s5a and s5b these results suggest that among the identified fractions the lmwn one might be the most associated with the structures of plastics which are vulnerable to photo oxidation the large sized molecules e g hs bb fraction particularly from pe dom seem to undergo partial degradation to smaller size species under uv irradiation as indicated by a strong negative correlation between hs bb and lmwn r 2 0 9259 p 0 001 n 26 fig s5c this explanation is consistent with many prior studies that reported that uv radiation preferentially attacked double bonded structures of organic matters and ultimately altered large sized molecules into smaller fractions sanly et al 2007 choi and choi 2010 maizel and remucal 2017 the relatively greater abundance of lmwn fractions in dom from reservoirs and wetland versus rivers has been ascribed to strong photo degradation of large sized dom molecules in the shallow and transparent freshwater environments liu et al 2010 3 4 potential impacts about mp dom as dbps precursor in this study thmfp of the mp dom was examined for the first time and the measured values were compared with those of aquatic n dom previously reported this investigation deserves special attention because mps are ubiquitous in substantial quantities in many aquatic systems including water wastewater treatment facilities carr et al 2016 murphy et al 2016 it was surprising to observe substantial levels of thms detected upon chlorination of the mp dom independently of whether the polymers were previously irradiated or not fig 4 chloroform chcl3 was the only thm species detected from the mp dom furthermore similar to the trends of doc the thmfp values were much higher for the mp dom under the uv irradiation versus the dark condition after 14 days of irradiation the thmfp values became 7697 75 μg thm l 1 for pe dom and 15 990 42 μg thm l 1 for pp dom while the values under the dark condition were 21 2 μg thm l 1 for pe dom and 22 4 μg thm l 1 for pp dom at the same leaching time the leached doc obtained under uv irradiation either with pe or pp presented a strong positive correlation with the total thmfp r 2 0 9799 p 0 001 n 26 fig 4a in contrast there was no significant correlation between the two parameters in the dark treatments p 0 570 which can be attributed in part to the very low doc concentrations and the large uncertainties associated with the values fig 4a these results indicate that uv irradiation can play a critical role in raising the risk associated with dbp formation from mp dom such positive linear relationships for the total thmfp were also observed for the individual size fractions of mp dom i e hs bb lmwa and lmwn fig 4b table s2 among the size fractions the lmwa exhibited the strongest correlation between the leached doc and the total thmfp r 2 0 9301 p 0 001 n 52 interestingly a similar trend has also been reported in a previous study based on aquatic n dom which showed that the lmw fractions of river dom obtained using ultra filtration 500 da produced more thms than other larger size mw fractions did zhao et al 2006 the doc normalized thm formation potential or specific thmfp of the mp dom were compared with those of other aquatic n dom in previous literatures table 1 under a similar chlorination condition i e 5 mg cl mg c 1 for a 3 day incubation at 25 c and irrespective of the leaching conditions i e light or dark the mp dom presented comparable or even greater potentials towards thm formation per doc than those of typical aquatic n dom independently of whether they were sourced from rivers or from lakes hao et al 2017 the mp dom obtained under uv irradiation exhibited a higher range of thmfps per doc than those under dark conditions 40 3 440 vs 3 8 84 μg thm mg c 1 for pe dom and 29 2 453 3 vs 1 9 109 6 μg thm mg c 1 for pp dom paired t test p 0 001 the result suggests that the organic byproducts from the photochemical breakdown of the mp polymers probably have a strong tendency to form thms upon chlorination meanwhile no significant differences were found in the specific thmfps between the two mp polymers paired t test p 0 109 signifying no discrimination between the polymer types in the thmfp 3 5 environmental implications this study highlights the critical protective role of plastic additives in dom leaching from plastic materials under uv irradiation as indicated by the higher leaching under uv irradiation versus dark condition the finding is significant because plastics may lose their additives due to physical and chemical abrasion during their transport in aqueous environments uv irradiation condition can be a common feature of sunlit freshwater systems such as lake and wetland or water treatment systems employing uv irradiation this study is the first report quantifying the dbpfp of mp dom which revealed a range of values comparable to those of aquatic n dom this novel finding underscores the need to critically evaluate potable water sources or wastewaters that might contain substantial amounts of mps prior to the disinfection step the undesirable generation of dbps can be even more serious when uv irradiation processes are involved for mps containing water on the other hand this new finding calls for a re evaluation of the dbpfp previously attributed to pure n dom in the aquatic systems in long contact with plastics under uv light this study provided a new insight into the unique characteristics of dom from mp polymers and raised awareness of the environmental risk associated with the formation of dbps upon disinfection in treatment facilities however to generate more concrete evidence for the reported results comparative leaching experiments are warranted in future studies with identical settings as reported in this study but using physically or chemically weathered commercial mps this effort would further clarify the differences in the degree of the dom leaching from mps with versus without additives and in the related environmental impacts 4 conclusions leaching behaviors of pe and pp plastic polymers were examined under uv light and dark conditions and the leached mp dom was characterized in terms of doc concentrations functional groups molecular size distributions and thmfps the characteristics were compared with those of typical aquatic n dom the following main conclusions can be drawn based on the results of this study 1 uv irradiation accelerated the dom leaching from two common plastic polymers the vulnerable property to uv light was more pronounced for pp versus pe polymer 2 irrespective of polymer type uv irradiation induced mp dom exhibited the presence of a unique functional group related to vinyl unsaturated bond in the structure which showed an increasing trend with irradiation 3 mp dom was characterized by a predominant distribution of lmwn size fraction 350 da and small presence of hs bb fraction which contrasts with the typical feature of aquatic n dom with prevailing distribution of large size molecules among the three size fractions the lmwn was the most associated with the production of mp dom molecules accelerated by uv irradiation 4 mp dom exhibited a high potential to 411 generate thms and the doc normalized thmfp was comparable to those of aquatic n dom reported in the literature suggesting that mp dom can act as a significant precursor of dbps upon chlorination the specific thmfp values tended to be higher for mp dom produced under uv irradiation compared to those under dark conditions declaration of

18011,although there are numerous studies concerning the occurrence of microplastics mp in the environment and its impact on the ecosystem dissolved organic matter dom leached from mp mp dom has received little attention and its characteristics have been rarely examined it is presumed that the dom leaching from plastics could be accelerated when plastics lost their protective additives during their transport and weathering processes in aquatic systems in this study two additive free mps or micro sized plastic polymers were leached in artificial freshwater under uv irradiation and dark conditions the leached dom was characterized by typical analyses for naturally occurring dom n dom such as dissolved organic carbon doc size exclusion chromatography sec and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir the potential to generate trihalomethanes thms a well known environmental impact of n dom was also explored for the dom with plastic origins for the first time the leaching results demonstrated that uv irradiation promoted the leaching of dom from the plastic polymers with an amount corresponding to 3 of the total mass of the polymers the leached amounts were much greater than those previously reported using commercial plastics which presumably contained protective additives the sec results revealed that different from typical aquatic n dom mp dom is mostly composed of low molecular weight fractions 350 da for the two polymer types polyethylene and polypropylene the mp dom exhibited a high potential to form thms upon chlorination which was comparable to those of typical aquatic n dom this study highlighted an overlooked contribution of uv irradiation to the dom leaching from additive free plastics and the potential risk of mp dom to produce toxic disinfection byproducts dbps upon chlorination graphical abstract image 1 keywords microplastics dissolved organic matter polymers molecular size distribution trihalomethanes thms 1 introduction the massive production of plastics poses serious risks for the environment and the global ecosystems due to the limited recycling and improper disposal approximately 270 000 tons of plastics and more than 5 trillion plastic pieces are currently floating in the world s oceans eriksen et al 2014 during its transport to the ocean through rivers or coastal systems most disposed plastics are subjected to natural abiotic degradation processes involving chemical and mechanical reactions which are collectively called weathering leading to the fragmentation of the plastics weinstein et al 2016 song et al 2017 plastic particles with the size of 5 mm the so called microplastics mps have received tremendous attention in recent years law and thompson 2014 jambeck et al 2015 siegfried et al 2017 these small sized plastic debris are ubiquitous in natural aquatic systems such as freshwater coastal systems and open oceans wagner et al 2014 eerkes medrano et al 2015 su et al 2016 alimi et al 2018 li et al 2018 as well as in water treatment facilities mason et al 2016 in addition to the main polymer chains commercial plastics commonly contain various types of plasticizers and or antioxidants termed additives that protect the principal polymeric chain from breakdown caused by irradiation and weathering the additives also help to improve the product quality like ductility and structural stability it was previously reported that when plastics are in long contact with water the additives plus the oligomers or monomers from the main polymer chains could be released to the aquatic media suhrhoff and scholz böttcher 2016 furthermore with the progress of the fragmentation of plastics the more production of such nano sized materials and the more leaching of dissolved organic substances from plastics could occur lambert and wagner 2016 chemical modifications promoted by uv irradiation may produce structural damage to plastic materials accelerating the release of dissolved organic compounds i e additives and or polymer derived organic substances potthoff et al 2017 previous studies have demonstrated the vulnerable property of polymer chains containing low or zero amount of antioxidant additives by tracking the changes in the infrared spectra of the plastic after photo oxidation gardette et al 2013 or through the mechanical tension test ojeda et al 2011 to date most mp studies have focused on particle counting without paying much attention to its potential leaching capacity romera castillo et al 2018 have provided a new insight into the overlooked phenomenon by demonstrating that substantial amounts of dissolved organic matter dom were leached from mps in ambient seawater it is easily presumed that microplastic derived dom mp dom can be widespread in natural and engineered aquatic systems while much still remains unknown about the characteristics of the leached dom and the environmental impacts it was previously reported that a substantial amount 65 million particles per day of mps were released from one treatment facility through effluent water everyday murphy et al 2016 moreover there is a possibility that the actual occurrence of mp dom could be more pronounced than presumed from the observed number of the mp particles remaining in treatment facilities because weathering of mps followed by the release of dom might already take place prior to the removal of mp particles in the treatment systems chlorine is the most widely used disinfection agent in water treatment processes around the world due to its high effectiveness and affordability for the control of pathogens many wastewater treatment plants operate a chlorine disinfection treatment prior to the final discharge krasner et al 2008 however the formation of toxic disinfection byproducts dbps following chlorination of treated water wastewater is an unavoidable consequence and arguably constitutes one of the most critical risks of dom to aquatic ecosystems and human health while the dbp formation potentials of naturally occurring dom n dom from different origins have been much studied and well documented wang et al 2017 zhai et al 2017 no effort has been made to examine the potential of mp dom to form dbps upon chlorination in addition considering that mp dom co exist with n dom in the aquatic environment it is an intriguing question whether or not mp dom would behave similarly with aquatic n dom in terms of dbp formation potential to answer all the questions this study aimed at characterizing the dom leached from mp polymers under different environmental settings and the formation potential of dbps to the best of the authors knowledge there has not been any previous study that examined the dom derived from additive free mps i e mp polymers the specific tasks of this study were to 1 compare the amounts of dom leached from mp polymers under dark and uv irradiation conditions 2 characterize the mp dom using the analytical tools for n dom including fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir and size exclusion chromatography with organic carbon detection sec ocd and 3 explore the possibility of mp dom serving as a precursor of trihalomethanes thms upon chlorination 2 materials and methods 2 1 microplastic polymers two types of plastic polymers or additive free plastics were used for this study they are based on polyethylene pe and polypropylene pp materials which were obtained from sigma aldrich and polyscience companies asia pacific inc taiwan branch respectively two particle sizes were selected for each mp polymer as 40 48 μm for pe and 25 85 μm for pp the choice of the plastic polymers used in this study is based on the previous report of the highest consumption discharge rate in the world geyer et al 2017 pe 36 pp 21 furthermore the two materials have been widely used in the refined forms for many polymer studies beckingham and ghosh 2017 paço et al 2017 2 2 microplastic polymer leaching experiments three different factors which might affect the leached amounts of dom from the two polymers were taken into account for the leaching experiments they were i the mass of mp per water volume 0 1 2 0 g mp l 1 ii contact time with water or leaching time 1 h 14 days and iii uv irradiation the applied amounts of the plastic polymers which are expressed by the mass per water volume were referred to the observed ranges previously reported in relevant studies suhrhoff and scholz böttcher 2016 since this study aimed to characterize the dom leached from plastic polymers the added amounts of mp were intentionally designed to be higher than the values reported in natural water environment alimi et al 2018 for the experiments an aqueous solution was prepared to have the ion composition similar to a typical freshwater which consists of nahco3 96 mg l 1 caso4 47 4 mg l 1 mgso4 7h2o 122 86 mg l 1 and kcl 4 mg l 1 according to the u s environmental protection agency epa protocol epa 821 r 02 013 edition 2002 the mp polymers were added in powder like form to 50 ml of the artificial freshwater in sterilized glass vials n 237 which were autoclaved at 120 c for 15 min the vials were placed in the dark on a shaker at 150 rpm and each vial was sacrificed for sampling at designated contact times during the 14 days of the leaching test controls were also prepared following the same procedure without the addition of the polymers the mixing solution with the suspended particles was filtered through a pre ashed whatman gf f filter to obtain the mp dom in the filtration step a glassware vacuum filtration device was used instead of a syringe filter to minimize further contact with other plastic materials all the experiments were performed in triplicate for a uv irradiation setup 50 ml of the artificial freshwater solution containing 50 mg of pe or pp polymers with 100 μm particle diameter were prepared in 14 autoclaved cylindrical quartz tubes 125 ml with an inner diameter of 4 5 cm and a height of 8 cm a stirrer was placed in the bottom of each quartz tube to achieve continual mixing throughout the 14 day leaching test the tubes were placed in the middle of a close cabinet surrounded inside by six 8w uva lamps with the characteristic wavelengths at 320 400 nm sankyo denki f8t5bl as light sources fig s1 the light intensity in the closed cabinet was equivalent to that of natural solar light at noon time in may seoul south korea lee et al 2018b which was approximately 4000 μw cm 2 based on an ultraviolet uv meter model 850009 sper scientific the

molecular weight acids lmwa and low molecular weight neutrals lmwn were based on an established procedure huber et al 2011 and the in built software the sec analysis was performed on one representative sample for the three replicates 2 4 trihalomethanes formation potential thmfp measurement for mp dom the trihalomethanes thm formation potentials thmfp of mp dom samples were determined following the standard methods 5710b 6232b and 6251b but with some modifications lee et al 2018a the mp dom samples obtained under uv irradiation condition were diluted with ultrapure water to have a constant doc concentration i e 1 mg c l 1 while those under dark condition were used as they were because of the low concentrations the ph was adjusted to 7 0 with the addition of 1 ml of phosphate buffer per 50 ml of sample chlorination was performed by adding sodium hypochlorite to the dom samples to achieve a sufficient chlorine dosage naocl sigma aldrich 6 14 available chlorine of 5 mg cl2

park et al 2016 3 results and discussion 3 1 identification of the origins of mp dom infrared spectroscopy is a proven and reliable analytical technique for identifying the polymeric composition of mps gorassini et al 2016 jung et al 2018 the two mp polymers used in this study presented distinct spectral features with the appearance of a b c and f peaks for pe and a b c d and e peaks for pp in the ftir spectra fig 1 a and table s1 a b and c peaks which originate from the carbon chains of repeating ch2 units were commonly observed for the spectra of both mp polymers meanwhile structural differences were found between pe and pp which were characterized by the exclusive presence of d i e ch3 band and f i e ch2 rock band peaks for pp and pe respectively the ftir spectra of the dom samples from leaching experiments evidenced the origins of the two mp polymers fig 1 and s2 regardless of the polymer type the c h bands were observed in the dom samples with a slight increasing trend of the peak intensity with leaching time under the dark condition fig 1b d the same approach using ftir spectra for the identification of mp dom has been adopted in a previous study using polymer powders jung et al 2018 for this study unlike the polymers presenting distinct spectral features between pe and pp the mp dom did not exhibit any obvious difference between the ir spectra of the two polymer types these results indicate that the carbon structures of the mp dom might be similar despite the different plastic origins or polymer types according to a previous report on the photo chemically induced oxidation of polyolefin bracco et al 2018 uv irradiation is likely to induce various modifications on polymer structures such as cross linking chain branching and oxidative degradation in this study peaks a b and c were observed in the mp dom samples after uv irradiation as well as in the dark treatments even though the peaks were less prominent than those in the dark the most striking difference in the ftir spectra between the two treatments was the unique appearance of peak g consisting of the vinyl unsaturated bands at 973 and 996 cm 1 in the irradiated samples peak g showed an increasing trend with irradiation time indicative of its association with uv irradiation the observation can be attributed to the generation of photolytic byproducts from the mp polymers by photochemical cleavage fig 1c e or the so called norrish reactions gardette et al 2013 however there were no notable changes in the range of double bonds h peak 1640 1780 cm 1 ketones carboxylic acids esters and lactones of the mp dom along the irradiation time even though the bands have been reported to be related to typical routes of the norrish reactions figs s2b and s2d gardette et al 2013 bracco et al 2018 further studies are warranted to examine the exact photochemical reactions involving the dom leaching under uv irradiation 3 2 factors affecting the amounts of mp dom 3 2 1 effects of mp dose polymer type and leaching time dom leaching behavior under dark condition was evaluated in terms of mp concentration and different polymer types fig s3 the released dom amounts showed a general increasing trend with a higher dose of plastic for example the doc concentrations of the mp dom changed from 66 5 to 390 4 μg c l 1 with increasing dose from 0 1 g l 1 to 2 0 g l 1 of the pe polymer after 7 days of leaching the enhancing effect of mp dose on dom leaching was further supported by the significant correlations between the doc concentrations and the doses of the mp polymers with the r 2 values of 0 871 p 0 001 n 20 for pe and 0 784 p 0 001 n 20 for pp fig s3 the average released amounts of mp dom after 7 days of leaching were 368 17 μg c g 1 for pe n 10 and 93 4 μg c g 1 n 10 for pp in doc per gram of polymers which were equivalent to 0 03 of the total mass of the mp polymers used although the leached amount is very small per mps it cannot be neglected considering the tremendous occurrence of mps in the aquatic environments romera castillo et al 2018 have reported that globally up to 23 600 metric tons of doc might be leached from plastic entering the ocean per year meanwhile the released doc concentrations from pe i e pe dom was nearly four times higher than those from pp i e pp dom at all polymer doses fig s3 suggesting the dom leaching concentrations are highly dependent upon the polymer types the pe chains appear to be more vulnerable in a water environment than the pp chains this trend agreed well with a previous report romera castillo et al 2018 in which low density pe ldpe and high density pe hdpe released higher concentrations of doc between 2 79 and 8 92 μg c cm 2 than pp 1 61 μg c cm 2 in the dark for both polymer types leaching time or contact time was not likely to be a critical factor to influence the amounts of mp dom released since no significant difference paired t test p 0 07 n 40 were observed in the leached doc concentrations after an instantaneous contact with water versus a 7 days contact for example the instantaneously leached doc concentrations were equivalent to 84 90 of the total amounts leached after 7 days fig s3 the same trend was also reported in a previous study romera castillo et al 2018 which demonstrated that instantaneously leached dom amounts from commercial plastics corresponded to 60 26 of those after 7 days in some cases the immediately released doc concentration was even higher than that observed after 7 days of leaching e g 302 8 μg c l 1 versus 226 1 μg c l 1 when 1 g of the pe polymer per liter was used the reversed doc concentration trend for longer time of contact between mps and water might be explained by the adsorption of the initially released doc onto the surface of the mps bakir et al 2014 curran and strlič 2015 3 2 2 effect of uv irradiation in contrast to the dark treatment changes in the mp dom concentrations with leaching time was more obvious and dramatic under uv irradiation fig 2 which indicates the stimulating effect of uv light on the production of mp dom from the two polymers after 14 days of irradiation the doc concentrations of the mp dom became nearly 100 times greater than those under the dark condition fig 2a versus 2b suggesting that uv irradiation might play a role in changing the mp polymers into more vulnerable structures to dissolution the released amounts of mp dom after 7 days of leaching were 22 8 mg c g 1 for pe and 42 1 mg c g 1 for pp in doc per gram of polymers which were equivalent to an average of 3 2 of the total mass of the mp polymers similar structural instability of the polymer materials under uv light was previously reported in a study that documented substantial changes in the ir spectra of polymer film after direct uv irradiation gardette et al 2013 for this study the additional mp dom leaching upon uv irradiation was more pronounced for the pp versus the pe polymer with the leached concentrations corresponding to 42 1 mg c l 1 pp dom versus 22 9 mg c l 1 pe dom at the end of the irradiation i e 14 days song et al 2017 also demonstrated the similar trend in the fragmentation of plastics establishing a higher rate for pp versus pe materials under uv exposure lasting for 12 months the difference was attributed to the presence of alkyl groups on the pp polymer as alkyl radicals are more likely to be formed from the polymers with longer alkyl chains under uv irradiation aslanzadeh and haghighat kish 2010 rajakumar et al 2012 it is notable that such a uv irradiation stimulated mp dom leaching was not previously reported for additive containing plastics suhrhoff and scholz böttcher 2016 it is likely that the antioxidants serving as the main component of the additives in commercial plastics might protect the basic polymer chains from being broken down by the uv light the accelerated mp dom leaching under uv irradiation in this study strongly imply that the absence or partial loss of additives from mps could promote the production of mp dom in aquatic systems under uv irradiation since commercial plastics contain 20 additives on average which constitutes 1 60 of the total mass of the plastic material bilitewski et al 2012 the released amounts of mp dom per mass of plastic could be highly variable across different types of plastics 3 3 molecular size characteristics of mp dom three different size fractions were identified in the mp dom from the polymers fig 3 which included operationally defined hs bb lmwa and lmwn size fractions irrespective of the polymer type and the experimental conditions i e dark light lmwn 350 da was the predominant fraction constituting 61 87 of the total leached dom fig s5 this observation was in contrast with a typical pattern of aquatic n dom characterized by a lower distribution of lmwn suwannee river nom 14 paldang lake 38 han river 29 versus hs fraction fig s4 the sec result of the mp dom was in line with a previous study using mass spectroscopy that detected the occurrence of homogeneous n alkanes between c 12 and c 32 in an aqueous phase when commercial pe was placed in contact with water suhrhoff and scholz böttcher 2016 these chains represent low molecular weight oligomers simoneit et al 2005 under uv irradiation the concentrations of all identified size fractions increased with the irradiation time for both pp dom and pe dom fig 3e and f the most pronounced increasing trend was observed in the lmwn fraction which led to changes in the proportion of the lmwn from 61 to 80 for pe dom and from 77 to 87 for pp dom over 14 days of leaching correspondingly the larger molecular size fraction i e hs bb exhibited slowly decreasing trends in their relative abundance with irradiation time figs s5a and s5b these results suggest that among the identified fractions the lmwn one might be the most associated with the structures of plastics which are vulnerable to photo oxidation the large sized molecules e g hs bb fraction particularly from pe dom seem to undergo partial degradation to smaller size species under uv irradiation as indicated by a strong negative correlation between hs bb and lmwn r 2 0 9259 p 0 001 n 26 fig s5c this explanation is consistent with many prior studies that reported that uv radiation preferentially attacked double bonded structures of organic matters and ultimately altered large sized molecules into smaller fractions sanly et al 2007 choi and choi 2010 maizel and remucal 2017 the relatively greater abundance of lmwn fractions in dom from reservoirs and wetland versus rivers has been ascribed to strong photo degradation of large sized dom molecules in the shallow and transparent freshwater environments liu et al 2010 3 4 potential impacts about mp dom as dbps precursor in this study thmfp of the mp dom was examined for the first time and the measured values were compared with those of aquatic n dom previously reported this investigation deserves special attention because mps are ubiquitous in substantial quantities in many aquatic systems including water wastewater treatment facilities carr et al 2016 murphy et al 2016 it was surprising to observe substantial levels of thms detected upon chlorination of the mp dom independently of whether the polymers were previously irradiated or not fig 4 chloroform chcl3 was the only thm species detected from the mp dom furthermore similar to the trends of doc the thmfp values were much higher for the mp dom under the uv irradiation versus the dark condition after 14 days of irradiation the thmfp values became 7697 75 μg thm l 1 for pe dom and 15 990 42 μg thm l 1 for pp dom while the values under the dark condition were 21 2 μg thm l 1 for pe dom and 22 4 μg thm l 1 for pp dom at the same leaching time the leached doc obtained under uv irradiation either with pe or pp presented a strong positive correlation with the total thmfp r 2 0 9799 p 0 001 n 26 fig 4a in contrast there was no significant correlation between the two parameters in the dark treatments p 0 570 which can be attributed in part to the very low doc concentrations and the large uncertainties associated with the values fig 4a these results indicate that uv irradiation can play a critical role in raising the risk associated with dbp formation from mp dom such positive linear relationships for the total thmfp were also observed for the individual size fractions of mp dom i e hs bb lmwa and lmwn fig 4b table s2 among the size fractions the lmwa exhibited the strongest correlation between the leached doc and the total thmfp r 2 0 9301 p 0 001 n 52 interestingly a similar trend has also been reported in a previous study based on aquatic n dom which showed that the lmw fractions of river dom obtained using ultra filtration 500 da produced more thms than other larger size mw fractions did zhao et al 2006 the doc normalized thm formation potential or specific thmfp of the mp dom were compared with those of other aquatic n dom in previous literatures table 1 under a similar chlorination condition i e 5 mg cl mg c 1 for a 3 day incubation at 25 c and irrespective of the leaching conditions i e light or dark the mp dom presented comparable or even greater potentials towards thm formation per doc than those of typical aquatic n dom independently of whether they were sourced from rivers or from lakes hao et al 2017 the mp dom obtained under uv irradiation exhibited a higher range of thmfps per doc than those under dark conditions 40 3 440 vs 3 8 84 μg thm mg c 1 for pe dom and 29 2 453 3 vs 1 9 109 6 μg thm mg c 1 for pp dom paired t test p 0 001 the result suggests that the organic byproducts from the photochemical breakdown of the mp polymers probably have a strong tendency to form thms upon chlorination meanwhile no significant differences were found in the specific thmfps between the two mp polymers paired t test p 0 109 signifying no discrimination between the polymer types in the thmfp 3 5 environmental implications this study highlights the critical protective role of plastic additives in dom leaching from plastic materials under uv irradiation as indicated by the higher leaching under uv irradiation versus dark condition the finding is significant because plastics may lose their additives due to physical and chemical abrasion during their transport in aqueous environments uv irradiation condition can be a common feature of sunlit freshwater systems such as lake and wetland or water treatment systems employing uv irradiation this study is the first report quantifying the dbpfp of mp dom which revealed a range of values comparable to those of aquatic n dom this novel finding underscores the need to critically evaluate potable water sources or wastewaters that might contain substantial amounts of mps prior to the disinfection step the undesirable generation of dbps can be even more serious when uv irradiation processes are involved for mps containing water on the other hand this new finding calls for a re evaluation of the dbpfp previously attributed to pure n dom in the aquatic systems in long contact with plastics under uv light this study provided a new insight into the unique characteristics of dom from mp polymers and raised awareness of the environmental risk associated with the formation of dbps upon disinfection in treatment facilities however to generate more concrete evidence for the reported results comparative leaching experiments are warranted in future studies with identical settings as reported in this study but using physically or chemically weathered commercial mps this effort would further clarify the differences in the degree of the dom leaching from mps with versus without additives and in the related environmental impacts 4 conclusions leaching behaviors of pe and pp plastic polymers were examined under uv light and dark conditions and the leached mp dom was characterized in terms of doc concentrations functional groups molecular size distributions and thmfps the characteristics were compared with those of typical aquatic n dom the following main conclusions can be drawn based on the results of this study 1 uv irradiation accelerated the dom leaching from two common plastic polymers the vulnerable property to uv light was more pronounced for pp versus pe polymer 2 irrespective of polymer type uv irradiation induced mp dom exhibited the presence of a unique functional group related to vinyl unsaturated bond in the structure which showed an increasing trend with irradiation 3 mp dom was characterized by a predominant distribution of lmwn size fraction 350 da and small presence of hs bb fraction which contrasts with the typical feature of aquatic n dom with prevailing distribution of large size molecules among the three size fractions the lmwn was the most associated with the production of mp dom molecules accelerated by uv irradiation 4 mp dom exhibited a high potential to 411 generate thms and the doc normalized thmfp was comparable to those of aquatic n dom reported in the literature suggesting that mp dom can act as a significant precursor of dbps upon chlorination the specific thmfp values tended to be higher for mp dom produced under uv irradiation compared to those under dark conditions declaration of

18012,ion exchange is widely used to treat nitrate contaminated groundwater but high salt usage for resin regeneration and management of waste brine residuals increase treatment costs and add environmental burdens development of palladium based catalytic nitrate treatment systems for brine treatment and reuse has showed promising activity for nitrate reduction and selectivity towards the n2 over the alternative product ammonia but this strategy overlooks the potential value of nitrogen resources here we evaluated a hybrid catalytic hydrogenation membrane distillation process for nitrogen resource recovery during treatment and reuse of nitrate contaminated waste ion exchange brines in the first step of the hybrid process a ru c catalyst with high selectivity towards ammonia was found to be effective for nitrate hydrogenation under conditions representative of waste brines including expected salt buildup that would occur with repeated brine reuse cycles the apparent rate

distillation was applied to recover the ammonia product from the brine matrix capturing nitrogen as ammonium sulfate a commercial fertilizer product solution ph significantly influenced the rate of ammonia mass transfer through the gas permeable membrane by controlling the fraction of free ammonia species nh3 present in the solution the rate of ammonia recovery was not affected by increasing salt levels in the brine indicating the feasibility of membrane distillation for recovering ammonia over repeated reuse cycles finally high rates of nitrate hydrogenation apparent rate constant 1 80 0 04 mm min 1 gru 1 and ammonia recovery overall mass transfer coefficient 0 20 m h 1 with the hybrid treatment process were demonstrated when treating a real waste ion exchange brine obtained from a

contaminated groundwater graphical abstract image 1 keywords oxyanion ion exchange waste brine catalytic hydrogenation membrane distillation resource recovery 1 introduction over the last century industrial n2 fixation enabled by the haber bosch process has played a critical role in sustaining the world s food supplies in the face of population growth however the process is energy intensive and a significant fraction of nitrogen fertilizer products are released from agricultural and industrial activities and enter surface and ground waters endangering aquatic environments and ecosystems camargo and alonso 2006 in particular nitrate in drinking water has been recognized as a human health hazard for which health guidelines and regulations have been established to protect populations and limit adverse effects as a result there has been a considerable interest in developing effective and sustainable treatment technologies for nitrate impacted drinking water sources chen et al 2019 garcia segura et al 2018 huo et al 2017 martínez et al 2017 ion exchange ix is an effective process for nitrate contaminated groundwater documented at many drinking water treatment plants kapoor and viraraghavan 1997 one of the major challenges of using ix is brine management due to their finite exchange capacities anion exchange resins aer require periodic regeneration using a concentrated salt brine solution commonly sodium chloride or sodium bicarbonate this process consumes large quantities of salt since only a fraction of the nacl used to prepare fresh brine solutions adsorbs to the resin during regeneration pintar et al 2001 in addition the regeneration step produces a nitrate contaminated waste brine stream that requires disposal or further treatment bergquist et al 2017a jensen and darby 2016 the low salt use efficiency and waste brine disposal are significant contributors to operation and maintenance o m costs for ix treatment wang et al 2011 thus strategies to increase salt use efficiency i e percentage of the salt applied ending up on the regenerated resin and minimize brine waste volumes are critical to improving the economics and environmental

et al 2013 mellor et al 1992 wang et al 2006 yang and lee 2005 ye et al 2017 in recent years catalytic hydrogenation has emerged as a promising technology for nitrate reduction wherein supported metal catalysts most often palladium based bimetallic catalysts chen et al 2003 constantinou et al 2006 jung et al 2014 sá and vinek 2005 xie et al 2011 promote nitrate reduction using h2 as a bulk reductant advantages of this technology include short start up times fast reactions use of a clean reducing agent that can be produced renewably h2 low risk of bacterial contamination and minimal production of contaminated disposals bergquist et al 2016 chen et al 2003 choe et al 2013 2015 martínez et al 2017 papa et al 2014 many research efforts have focused on identifying catalysts and operating conditions that selectively convert nitrate to gaseous n2 while minimizing formation of the alternative end product ammonia supported bimetallic pd catalysts e g pd cu pd in pd sn have been most extensively studied due to their high activity and tunable selectivity towards n2 chen et al 2003 constantinou et al 2006 jung et al 2014 sá and vinek 2005 xie et al 2011 while generally effective for treatment of a variety of nitrate containing water matrices recent studies show that nitrate reactions with some catalysts can be markedly inhibited by some natural water constituents that competitively adsorb to reactive surface sites chaplin et al 2006 pintar et al 1998 wang et al 2009 and reduced reaction rates for pd in catalysts have been documented in recent studies examining treatment of ix waste brine matrices bergquist et al 2016 2017a choe et al 2015 while catalytic nitrate reduction to gaseous n2 eliminates nitrogen residuals from the treated water this strategy represents a downcycling step that fails to capture any value embedded in the fixed nitrogen species present in the contaminated water nitrate reduction to the alternative product ammonia has typically been deemed undesirable bergquist et al 2016 dortsiou et al 2009 pintar et al 2001 yang et al 2013 but ammonia has potential value as fertilizer products e g anhydrous ammonia ammonium sulfate if a suitable process for recovering the endproduct can be identified e g volatilization and trapping of nh3 opportunities for recovering ammonia are most practical in matrices where nitrate has been concentrated like ix waste brines where nitrogen concentrations can reach 1000 mg l 1 bae et al 2002 mcadam and judd 2008 yang et al 2013 thus selective reduction of nitrate in ix waste brines to ammonia provides a potential pathway for recycling fixed nitrogen species as fertilizer products during water treatment at the same time removal of nitrate from the waste brine can enable reuse of the waste brine and significantly reduce net salt input requirements for the overall ix treatment processes in this work we introduce a hybrid ion exchange catalytic hydrogenation membrane distillation ix ch md pathway to simultaneously reduce salt input requirements and waste brine discharge volume while recovering nitrogen resources when treating nitrate contaminated water sources fig 1 here we focused on characterizing the waste brine management steps in the hybrid process specifically we assessed 1 treatment of nitrate contaminated ix waste brines using ru c an alternative to more costly pd based catalysts which we recently reported exhibits complete selectivity to ammonia when treating nitrate in freshwater matrices huo et al 2017 and 2 recovery of the resulting ammonia product from brine as ammonium sulfate a potentially valuable fertilizer product amaral et al 2016 garcia gonzález and vanotti 2015 li et al 2018 using membrane distillation experiments were conducted using both synthetic waste brine mimicking conditions reported in earlier studies as well as a real waste brine obtained from a drinking water utility that uses ix to treat nitrate contaminated groundwater the influence of key operating variables on the individual steps in the hybrid process were examined and findings provide a path forward for development of the hybrid process to simultaneously enable reuse of waste ix brines and reduce waste discharges while recovering a potentially valuable product stream 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials a commercial ru catalyst immobilized on carbon powder ru c nominal 5 wt ru was purchased from sigma aldrich and used as received previous characterization showed that the catalyst exhibits high surface area 860 m2 g 1 and ru metal dispersion 38 and h2 temperature programmed reduction and co chemisorption indicate surface ru is present predominantly in the metallic state under reaction conditions detailed characterization of this material was described elsewhere huo et al 2017 sodium nitrate and ammonium chloride were also obtained from sigma aldrich acs grade sodium sulfate sodium bicarbonate ammonium hydroxide

air waste ix brine was collected from a drinking water treatment plant in california composition of the waste brine is summarized in table 1 2 2 catalytic hydrogenation experiments to determine the influence of operating parameters on nitrate hydrogenation reactions kinetic studies were first conducted in synthetic brine solutions using a procedure adapted from a previous study huo et al 2017 a predetermined mass of ru c and a test solution 120 ml with desired background salt nacl nahco3 and or na2so4 concentrations were added to a 250 ml three neck flask equipped with rubber stoppers and a teflon coated magnetic stir bar fig 2 a initial rates were collected for the ru c loading ranging from 1 to 7 5 g l 1 to identify the conditions under which external mass transfer limitations are absent at the selected stirring speed 1100 rpm prior to initiating the reaction with nitrate ru c in aqueous suspension was maintained under 1 atm h2 headspace overnight by flowing excess h2 gas through the reactor 300 ml min 1 while continuously stirring the pretreatment duration was chosen to accommodate reactor schedule and a shorter duration will likely be acceptable and can be confirmed in future process optimization studies reaction was initiated by adding a small volume of concentrated nano3 stock solution 5 m to achieve the designed initial nitrate concentration 50 200 mm and reaction progress was tracked by periodically collecting aliquots of the catalyst suspension 1 5 ml for analysis collected aliquots were immediately filtered 0 45 μm cellulose acetate to quench the reaction reaction temperature was maintained with a circulating external water bath calibrated by an external thermometer the change of solution ph over the course of reaction was monitored orion double junction combination ph electrode calibrated by standard nist buffers apparent ph values were reported in the case where the effect of ph on reactions was evaluated solution ph was maintained by an automatic ph stat metrohm using hcl the collected filtrate aliquots were diluted with deionized water and analyzed for nitrate nitrite and or ammonia concentrations all experiments were performed in duplicate and uncertainties are reported as standard deviations the procedure for measuring catalytic hydrogenation of nitrate in real waste brine was modified to avoid the complication of nitrate reduction occurring during the period where the catalyst was pre exposed to h2 gas overnight prior to the reaction a small volume ru c slurry 0 6 g ru c in 10 ml deionized water was reduced overnight under h2 flow 300 ml min 1 at room temperature reaction was then initiated by introducing 100 ml of the waste brine to a flask containing the pre reduced catalyst as a control experiments were also conducted in a synthetic brine prepared to mimic the major ion composition of the real waste brine table 1 for tests where co2 g was used to buffer ph of the brine during treatment co2 gas was introduced to the reactor at 65 ml min 1 the rest of the procedure follows the description provided above a catalyst recycle experiment was also carried out to evaluate the reusability of ru c for waste brine treatment at the end of the reaction the catalyst was collected by filtering the suspension with a membrane filter 0 45 μm cellulose acetate rinsed with deionized water several times and dried in air at 70 c before reusing in the next reaction cycle 2 3 membrane distillation experiments a bench scale membrane distillation assembly was operated in direct contact batch mode to recover ammonia from synthetic brine and real waste brine that was first catalytically treated to reduce nitrate to ammonia fig 2b ammonia containing brine solutions were on the feed side and sulfuric acid 0 25 m was used on the absorbent side of the membrane assembly the membrane cell was custom made acrylic plastic cell and spacers were used in both the feed and the acid absorbent channels of the cell the cell was outfitted with a hydrophobic microporous membrane provided by bha altair llc ql822 the membrane is a polypropylene backed ptfe material with a nominal pore size of 0 45 μm with the functional layer in contact with the feed three cells each with a surface area of 195 cm2 were used in series the experiments were performed using co current flow to minimize the local pressure differential across the membrane the feed stream was pumped continuously during operation using a positive displacement gear pump micropump integral series idex corp vancouver wa the acid absorbent stream was also pumped continuously using a peristaltic pump masterflex l s series cole parmer usa flow rates of the feed and the acid absorbent were kept equal a heat exchanger was used to control the temperature of the feed brine stream tests were conducted prior to ammonia recovery experiments to validate membrane integrity and ensure that the membranes were not wetted four liters of brine feed solution was used for each experiment the concentration of h2so4 in the acid absorbent 0 25 m 1 2 l was designed to be excessive to ensure complete capture of ammonia passing through the membrane as nh4 2so4 kinetic studies were conducted with synthetic solutions to examine the impact of operating parameters on ammonia recovery the synthetic solutions were prepared by dissolving predetermined amount of salts nacl nahco3 and or na2so4 ammonia aqueous solution and base naoh in deionized water the amount of ammonia in aqueous solutions and naoh was determined by assuming complete

hydrogenation catalytic hydrogenation with ru c was initially evaluated in synthetic brine solutions prepared at conditions representative of nitrate contaminated waste ix brines designed to assess the influence of major anions and operating conditions tests showed that the initial rate of nitrate hydrogenation increased linearly with the catalyst loading ranging from 1 to 7 5 g l 1 fig s1 consistent with negligible external mass transfer limitations huo et al 2017 rao et al 1998 ruppert et al 2009 however the possibility of internal mass transfer limitations within the catalyst particles cannot be ruled out which is an inherent challenge for porous catalyst materials choe et al 2015 a catalyst loading of 5 g l 1 was then selected for use in subsequent experiments fig 3 shows the time profile of nitrate hydrogenation observed under the baseline testing conditions 100 mm initial nitrate concentration 5 g l 1 ru c in 5 wt nacl 100 mm nahco3 100 mm na2so4 30 c no ph control the rate of nitrate hydrogenation appeared to be constant for the first half life although this observation alone is not sufficient to formally establish reaction order we calculated apparent zero order rate constants using data collected for the first half life to facilitate comparison of catalyst activity under different feed solution chemistries and operating conditions within the given system and also with catalyst activities reported in literature bergquist et al 2016 choe et al 2015 2 n o 3 n o 3 0 k 0 m r u t where no 3 o is the initial aqueous nitrate concentration mm no 3 is the aqueous nitrate concentration at reaction time t min and k 0 is the apparent zero order rate constant normalized to ru metal mass in the reactor suspension mm min 1 gru 1 and m ru is the mass loading of active ru metal in the aqueous suspension gru l 1 under the baseline testing condition k 0 was found to be 0 30 0 03 mm min 1 gru 1 this value falls within the same order of magnitude as values reported for pd in c catalysts using a similar semi batch reactor 0 18 0 81 mm min 1 gpd 1 choe et al 2015 indicating comparable activity and feasibility for treating waste ix brine with ru based catalysts this finding is also notable because market costs for ru have historically been much lower than pd chen et al 2017 huo et al 2017 vardon et al 2017 ammonia was the only product in the liquid phase but nitrogen mass balance closure was hindered by nh3 transfer to the flowing h2 in the headspace we confirmed the selective nitrate reduction to ammonia based on real ix waste brine treatment results as shown later the values of k 0 measured in synthetic brines of varying composition are summarized in table 2 an inverse dependence was observed between k 0 and initial nitrate concentration reducing the initial nitrate concentration from 100 mm to 50 mm resulted in k 0 increasing from 0 30 to 0 70 mm min 1 gru 1 while increasing the initial nitrate concentration to 200 mm resulted in k 0 decreasing to 0 08 mm min 1 gru 1 this trend suggests that the zero order behavior observed for individual batch reactions may not represent the inherent nitrate hydrogenation kinetics considering the potential influence of products on reaction rates a more formal approach to study kinetics in batch reactor is to examine the relationship between initial rate and initial concentrations ngo et al 2018 tadepalli et al 2007 3 d n o 3 0 d t k n o 3 0 a h 2 0 b 4 ln d n o 3 0 d t a ln n o 3 0 b ln h 2 0 ln k where k is the rate constant a and b are the reaction orders for nitrate and hydrogen respectively and h 2 o is the initial aqueous concentration of hydrogen which is proportional to hydrogen partial pressure in the gas phase according to henry s law because k and h 2 o are constant in the current system a can be obtained from the slope of plotting the natural log of initial nitrate hydrogenation rate versus the natural log of initial nitrate concentration a value of 1 5 was obtained for a over the range of nitrate concentration tested in this study fig s2 which indicates the saturation of the catalyst surface with nitrate and therefore blocking h2 adsorption nijhuis et al 2002 the non integer is challenging to be completely rationalized and further study of initial rates with well controlled system free of non target ions e g nacl is needed to develop a more formal kinetic model for catalytic nitrate reduction in brine solutions because the nitrate hydrogenation reaction generates oh as a product eq 1 solution ph increases as nitrate hydrogenation proceeds in the absence of an appropriate buffer under the baseline condition solution ph increased from an initial value of 9 5 to a final value of 12 6 by the end of the reaction fig 3 to evaluate the potential influence of solution ph on nitrate hydrogenation apparent zero order rate constants were determined for reactions where ph was maintained at circumneutral ph conditions ph 7 5 and basic ph conditions ph 11 by automatic ph stat with hcl addition similar reaction rate constants were observed at both ph conditions table 2 with k 0 only increasing by 20 at the higher ph conditions at first glance the limited effect of changing solution ph appears to contradict findings reported previously for the same catalyst reacting with lower initial nitrate concentrations e g 1 6 mm instead of 100 mm where the first order reaction constant decreased at basic conditions huo et al 2017 however the differing ph dependent trends can be attributed to how ph affects the concentration of nitrate adsorbing to catalyst surfaces at different nitrate concentrations with increasing ph the catalyst surfaces become more negatively charged due to deprotonation of acidic surface functional groups on the support and accumulation of oh on the metal surface abdelrahman et al 2015 inhibiting electrostatic attraction and decreasing affinity for adsorption of oxyanions like nitrate at lower nitrate concentrations in the solution phase this can inhibit reaction of nitrate with adsorbed atomic hydrogen by decreasing the pre equilibrium concentrations of adsorbed nitrate chen et al 2010 epron et al 2002 wang et al 2014 while the intrinsic affinity of nitrate for adsorption to the surface is still likely reduced when higher initial nitrate concentrations are used the very high concentration of nitrate in the solution 100 mm is still sufficient to drive the nitrate adsorption to achieve high nitrate surface coverage as a result the apparent rate of nitrate hydrogenation is little affected by the change in solution ph conditions three major non target anions in waste brines and reused brines i e chloride bicarbonate and sulfate table 1 were then systematically evaluated for their influence on nitrate hydrogenation activity with ru c removal of all three anions from the solution led to a 50 decrease in k 0 from 0 30 to 0 15 mm min 1 gru 1 table 2 similar reductions in k 0 were found in the ph buffered experiments mentioned above where the three ions had also been removed from the matrix collectively these observations indicate that either increases in overall salinity of the water promotes catalyst reactivity with nitrate or that more specific interaction involving one or more of the major anions acts to promote nitrate reactions subsequent experiments suggest that the bicarbonate anion component is particularly important to catalytic reactions with nitrate the rate constant measured in brine prepared without the bicarbonate component 0 16 mm min 1 gru 1 was similar to the value measured in the absence of all three major anions 0 15 mm min 1 gru 1 whereas the rate constant measured in solution containing only the bicarbonate component 0 58 mm min 1 gru 1 was nearly four times the value measured with no brine components and twice the value measured in the baseline brine condition where all three major anions were present on the other hand doubling the chloride and sulfate components decreased k 0 from 0 30 to 0 10 mm min 1 gru 1 collectively these findings indicate that chloride and sulfate anions competitively inhibit nitrate reactions with ru c but bicarbonate anions serve to promote increased catalytic reactions of nitrate the inhibitory effects of chloride and sulfate are consistent with observations reported for pd based catalysts bergquist et al 2016 choe et al 2015 pintar et al 1998 which are attributed to competitive inhibition of nitrate adsorption the reason for enhanced reactivity in the presence of elevated concentrations of bicarbonate is less clear this ion differs from the other two in that it possesses a labile proton 5 hco 3 h co 3 2 p k a 10 33 nitrate reduction to ammonia consumes h eq 1 so it is possible that bicarbonate can serve as a proton donor in the rate determining step on the overall reaction thereby increasing the apparent rate of nitrate hydrogenation lastly increasing solution temperature from 25 to 35 c showed a positive effect on k 0 table 2 similar to reports of nitrate reduction with pd based catalysts kim et al 2016 soares et al 2012 arrhenius plot of the data yielded an apparent activation energy ea of 45 6 kj mol 1 comparable to ea reported for nitrate hydrogenation with a pd cu al2o3 catalyst pintar et al 1996 in sum the nitrate hydrogenation experiments conducted in synthetic brine solutions support the technical feasibility of applying ru c catalyst for reduction of nitrate ions present in ix waste brines the effects of different constituents and operating conditions on reaction kinetics will inform future process design efforts for example waste heat sources if present may be leveraged to improve reaction rates which can also benefit subsequent recovery of ammonia by membrane distillation as discussed below 3 2 synthetic brine ammonia recovery by membrane distillation catalytic nitrate hydrogenation with ru c generates an ammonia rich brine the ammonia is then removed from the brine by membrane distillation and recovered as nh4 2so4 in a h2so4 trap solution fig 2b a similar approach to that used for catalytic hydrogenation studies was employed to evaluate ammonia recovery from synthetic waste ix brines by membrane distillation and identify the effects of important operating factors under the baseline testing conditions a synthetic brine feed was designed to have the same composition as the baseline testing solution for catalytic hydrogenation with the exception that nitrate is assumed to be hydrogenated stoichiometrically to ammonia according to eq 1 solution conditions including salt levels solution ph initial ammonia concentration and temperature were evaluated for their impact on ammonia recovery efficiency initial testing was used to select 1 5 l min 1 feed flow rate to allow for good mixing conditions at the boundary layer qu et al 2013 while maintaining the system at low pressure 7 5 psig to reduce the risk of wetting the membranes qi and cussler 1985 under the baseline conditions the kinetics of ammonia removal from the feed followed a first order rate law over the entire reaction time course fig 4 nitrogen mass balance closure was achieved when summing the total ammonia concentrations in the feed and acid absorbent sides of the membrane indicating that the system was well sealed and loss of ammonia to void spaces in the system was negligible the membranes employed in membrane distillation process are hydrophobic allowing vapor phase species to permeate while rejecting ionic constituents in the aqueous feed also because the temperatures of the feed and absorbent solutions were the same in the baseline testing conditions the driving force for ammonia mass transfer was only the difference in ammonia partial vapor pressure between the feed and the acid absorbent the latter was maintained at a minimum by trapping the absorbed ammonia in the protonated ammonium state that predominates in acidic solutions 6 nh4 h nh3 pk a 9 25 the feed solution ph decreased from 11 2 to 10 8 as the ammonia was removed consistent with removal of a base species from solution tao and ukwuani 2015 with very few exceptions feed solution ph remained 10 7 during the tests where free ammonia species predominates 96 table 3 due to the relatively low temperatures studied no higher than 35 c for all tests water evaporation through the membranes was not expected to be significant therefore the mass flux of ammonia j nh3 gnh3 n m 2 h 1 from the feed to the acid absorbent can be represented by the following equation 7 j n h 3 k m d n h 3 f where k md is the overall mass transfer coefficient m h 1 and nh 3 f is the concentration of free ammonia in the feed solution mgnh3 n l 1 the overall mass transfer coefficient comprises three resistances i e feed liquid side boundary resistance membrane resistance and acid absorbent side boundary resistance and depends on the membrane and operating conditions zarebska et al 2014 practically the value of k md can be determined by the following equation du preez et al 2005 el bourawi et al 2007 zarebska et al 2014 8 k m d v a t ln n h 3 f 0 n h 3 f where v is the total volume of the feed m3 a is the membrane area m2 nh 3 f 0 is the initial concentration of ammonia in the feed mm and nh 3 f is the ammonia concentration in the feed at time t h by plotting ln nh 3 f 0 nh 3 f versus time a straight line with the slope of k md a v was obtained and subsequently k md was determined the initial j n h 3 was then calculated from eq 7 under the baseline condition the initial j nh3 was found to be 268 gnh3 n m 2 h 1 with the corresponding k md of 0 19 m h 1 table 3 direct comparison of kinetic parameters observed in this study with those reported in the literature is challenging because rates of ammonia mass transfer strongly depend on several factors including system configuration and geometry membrane properties and hydrodynamic characteristics of the system arogo et al 1999 bennett and myers 1983 lauterböck et al 2013 qi and cussler 1985 consequently ammonia mass transfer coefficients using model ammonia aqueous solution by membrane contactors vary over a few orders of magnitude e g 10 5 m s 1 10 4 m h 1 ding et al 2006 zhu et al 2005 10 3 m h 1 ahn et al 2011 and 0 62 cm s 1 0 37 m h 1 qi and cussler 1985 the k md values measured in this study fall on the higher end of values reported even so ammonia recovery under different feed solution chemistry and operating conditions can be compared within the given system variable salt concentration and composition in the brine feed solutions 0 10 wt for nacl 0 200 mm for na2so4 had only a minor effect on ammonia mass transfer table 3 increasing ionic strength has slightly negative effect on the fraction of free ammonia species present at a given ph condition bower and bidwell 1978 however at the relatively high ph conditions 10 7 1 45 ph units above the pk a used in these tests the fraction of free ammonia species remained high rendering the effect of ionic strength insignificant during catalytic nitrate hydrogenation solution ph and free ammonia concentration were inherently coupled due to the hydroxide generated during the reaction eq 1 in addition ph of the brine solution was influenced by the buffering capacity of the solution during catalytic hydrogenation accordingly four test conditions were designed that combined two factors relevant to solution ph i e ammonia concentration and bicarbonate concentration each at two levels to simplify the synthetic solution preparation we added pre determined amounts of ammonia bicarbonate and hydroxide following reaction stoichiometry eq 1 assuming complete nitrate hydrogenation without loss of ammonia to the gas phase at relatively low buffering capacity e g 50 mm initial ammonia and 50 mm initial bicarbonate feed solution ph was 11 and measured k md 0 20 m h 1 was similar to that observed for the baseline testing condition table 3 on the other hand when the brine was initially more strongly buffered at circumneutral ph conditions e g 50 mm initial ammonia and 200 mm initial bicarbonate feed solution for membrane distillation had a lower initial ph value with an apparent solution ph of 9 2 a condition wherein only 50 of the ammonia is present as the free ammonia species and 50 as nh4 the measured value of k md calculated based upon total ammonia concentration decreased 51 table 3 suggesting that feed solution ph can strongly influence rates of ammonia mass transfer for brines with higher initial ammonia concentration e g 200 mm solution ph was generally higher 11 and measured k md values were again comparable with that observed for the baseline testing condition table 3 the initial j nh3 was observed to increase with the initial ammonia concentration which was expected from eq 8 as expected increasing temperature of the feed solution also had a positive effect on ammonia mass transfer for example k md decreased from the baseline condition 30 c to 0 16 m h 1 when temperature was reduced to 25 c and increased to 0 23 m h 1 when temperature was increased to 35 c table 3 this influence of temperature observed was consistent with literature findings with various membrane distillation configurations including vacuum and sweep gas membrane distillation ding et al 2006 wu et al 2016 xie et al 2009 with increasing feed solution temperature solute diffusivity increases ammonia solubility decreases and dissociation equilibrium is disturbed to favor dissociation which all can contribute to higher mass transfer rates arogo et al 1999 however increasing feed temperature to accelerate ammonia mass transfer will be increasingly limited at higher temperatures because the mass transfer of water vapor through the membrane is intensified compromising ammonia selectivity xie et al 2009 although membrane distillation has previously been explored for ammonia removal from wastewater its application in a concentrated brine matrix such as waste ix brine was evaluated for the first time in this study the relatively high k md values reported here indicate that the chosen membrane has desirable properties for such applications and the system geometry and liquid flow rate imparted thin liquid boundary layer to minimize mass transfer resistance similar to previous studies high feed solution ph and temperature were identified as critical variable for ammonia mass transfer further sensitivity analysis will be useful to optimize process operation by determining the relative changes of ammonia mass transfer coefficient per unit change of operating factor arogo et al 1999 3 3 demonstration of nitrate removal and ammonia recovery from real waste brine based on the results obtained in synthetic brines we conducted a demonstration of nitrate reduction and ammonia recovery with a real ion exchange waste brine obtained from a utility in california treating nitrate contaminated groundwater table 1 catalytic nitrate hydrogenation in the waste brine followed a zero order rate law fig 5 similar to synthetic brine solutions however the measured k 0 value was found to be significantly higher 1 80 0 04 mm min 1 gru 1 than the values measured in the synthetic brines table 2 as a control reaction was conducted in a synthetic waste brine with the same concentrations of major anions chloride nitrate and sulfate alkalinity by adding sodium bicarbonate and initial solution ph adjusted with naoh as the real waste brine interestingly the k 0 value measured in this synthetic mimic waste brine was 30 lower 1 24 0 02 mm min 1 gru 1 than the value measured in the real waste brine these results verify the technical feasibility of applying ru c for nitrate hydrogenation in ion exchange waste brine still further research is needed to identify the origin of the faster nitrate hydrogenation kinetics observed in the real waste brine it is noted that the real waste brine contains multiple minor constituents that are absent in the synthetic waste brine for example the sole cation used in the preparation of synthetic waste brine is na while the real waste brine contains several divalent and trivalent cations e g ca2 mg2 which have previously been shown to enhance rates of nitrate hydrogenation pintar et al 1998 in addition trace organics and metals in the real waste brine may interact with catalyst surfaces to enhance nitrate reactivity hörold et al 1993 liu et al 2014 moyer and meyer 1979 considering that bicarbonate showed positive influence on nitrate hydrogenation kinetics table 2 tests were conducted to co feed co2 with h2 which is a common practice for ph control when treating nitrate with pd based catalysts bergquist et al 2016 choe et al 2015 the nitrate hydrogenation rate was comparable with that in the absence of co2 for the first 0 5 h but the rate gradually decreased with further reaction time fig 5 this observation could be a result of lower hydrogen partial pressure and the accumulation of anionic bicarbonate and carbonate over time to compete with nitrate for active site adsorption for example the inorganic carbon concentration increased from 238 mm to 466 mm after 12 h of treatment on the other hand co feeding co2 significantly improved retention of ammonia in the open reactor system by maintaining solution ph between 7 6 and 7 9 where ionic nh4 predominates over the free ammonia species after 8 h of reaction 85 of the ammonia was retained in the liquid phase when co feeding co2 compared to only 51 in the absence of co2 buffer where ph increased to 10 0 allowing conversion of nh4 to the volatile nh3 species fig s3 to provide sufficient feed solution for the membrane distillation experiments catalytic hydrogenation of real waste brine was scaled up in 1 l reactors from 0 25 l flasks in experiments discussed to this point reaction was conducted for up to 24 h while co feeding co2 to maximize ammonia retention in the liquid phase these conditions resulted in near complete nitrate hydrogenation and the liquid phase retained 90 of the ammonia reaction product table 4 salt composition analysis showed no loss of chloride and sulfate while inorganic carbon concentration increased due to co2 absorption table 4 further reactor optimization can be used to improve reaction kinetics but this is beyond the scope of the present proof of concept study following catalytic reaction and just prior to beginning the membrane distillation experiment the solution ph was adjusted to 10 0 with naoh to better reflect the ph conditions observed when ph was allowed to drift without co2 buffer fig 6 a shows the observed kinetics of ammonia removal from the catalytically treated real waste brine and a synthetic brine prepared with the same major ion composition total ammonia and ph as the treated real waste brine ammonia removal in both brine matrices were similar and followed a first order model model fit of data collected in real waste brine yielded k md and j nh3 values of 0 11 m h 1 and 199 gnh3 n m 2 h 1 respectively limited supplies of the catalytically treated waste brine prevented replicate experiments this is similar to values measured in the synthetic brine k md 0 12 0 01 m h 1 and j nh3 225 4 gnh3 n m 2 h 1 and the k md value was of the same order of values obtained with other synthetic solutions table 3 good nitrogen mass balance closure was also observed by summing the total ammonia concentrations in the waste brine feed and acid absorbent solutions fig 6b salt composition and concentrations after membrane distillation were almost invariant table 4 verifying membrane integrity within tested operation time and high selectivity for transfer of ammonia these results indicate that membrane distillation can be an effective process for recovering ammonia from real waste brine matrices overall the hybrid catalytic hydrogenation membrane distillation process resulted in 99 removal of nitrate from the waste brine and 80 nitrogen recovery in form of aqueous nh4 2so4 small quantities of nitrogen 7 remained in the treated brine as either ammonia or nitrate and the remainder was presumed to be lost to the gas phase during semi batch catalytic reactions while further improvements in system efficiency are likely through reactor optimization findings reported here provide a proof of concept demonstration that the hybrid process can simultaneously treat nitrate contaminated waste brines and recover nitrogen as commercially viable fertilizer product 3 4 application considerations of the hybrid process compared with conventional brine treatment systems the hybrid catalytic hydrogenation membrane distillation process enables brine reuse and provides potentially valuable product through nitrogen transformation and recovery nitrogen in the form of dilute nitrate contamination present in the source water was transformed to a much more concentrated and pure nh4 2so4 solution fig 1 which can be used as a liquid fertilizer or a precursor for production of solid fertilizer amaral et al 2016 garcia gonzález and vanotti 2015 li et al 2018 this process leverages chemical potential difference as the driving force e g nitrate adsorption to ion exchange resin nitrate hydrogenation on ru surface and ammonia mass transfer across membrane and has minimal thermal energy requirement therefore it likely has higher energy efficiency compared to the traditional high energy haber bosch ammonia synthesis from n2 g the revenue from selling the nh4 2so4 product may be approximated from the quantity and market price of nh4 2so4 as an example a medium size water treatment plant 10 mgd that removes 30 mgno3 n l recovers 415 tonne nh3 n year yielding 1960 tonne nh4 2so4 year which equates an annual revenue of 284 000 with an nh4 2so4 price at 145 tonne world sulphuric acid weekly 2017 although producing nh4 2so4 through the hybrid catalytic hydrogenation membrane distillation process requires capital investment and consumption of h2 and sulfuric acid this process also reduces the costs for ix treatment by improving salt use efficiency and drastically reducing waste brine disposal costs while also limiting downstream environmental releases of nitrate wang et al 2011 therefore a full techno economic analysis and life cycle environmental impact assessment of the overall process are required to more rigorously evaluate the economics and environmental sustainability of the hybrid process demonstrated here this analysis should include important factors such as process scale and potential reductions in overall salt usage and waste discharge costs an initial conceptual evaluation of the economic and environmental viability of the catalytic hydrogenation process may be achieved by comparing the current system with a more developed brine treatment system using pd based catalysts bergquist et al 2016 choe et al 2015 previous work showed that both the o m costs and environmental impacts of recycling ix brines by treating nitrate with pd in c catalysts can be lower than those of conventional ix processes choe et al 2015 a critical factor to delivering these benefits is reducing the catalyst cost particularly the use of pd chiueh et al 2011 catalyst cost is directly associated with the cost of the active metal dominated by pd for pd in c catalysts and catalyst quantity which is determined by catalyst activity less catalyst material is required for catalysts that exhibit higher activity along this line of consideration ru catalysts have an advantage over pd based catalysts due to the historically lower cost of ru chen et al 2017 huo et al 2017 vardon et al 2017 in addition ru catalysts have been reported to have high activity for nitrate reduction similar to pd cu c catalysts huo et al 2017 this study further confirmed that ru c is active for nitrate hydrogenation in various brine conditions although comparison between ru c activity determined in this study and that of pd in c catalysts in the literature is not straightforward under different reaction conditions their apparent zero order rate constants normalized to metal mass are of similar magnitude when treating synthetic brine solutions and the rate constant with ru c for treating a real waste brine is approximately two fold higher than the highest value reported for pd in c catalysts bergquist et al 2016 choe et al 2015 all suggesting that ru catalysts have a potential to improve the economic and environmental sustainability of the catalytic treatment step of the hybrid process a less studied but critically important consideration for catalytic processes is catalyst stability and longevity catalyst longevity is ultimately required to fulfill the assumptions of catalyst lifetime usually years during techno economic analysis and life cycle assessment choe et al 2013 2015 hutchison et al 2017 catalyst stability also affects catalyst loading design for a fixed volume of waste brine and vice versa brine regeneration cycle design with a fixed loading of catalyst generally the higher the total volume of waste brine that can be treated with the catalyst the more savings that can be gained from brine reuse bergquist et al 2016 ru c stability for waste brine hydrogenation was initially assessed using a batch recycle test after the first use catalyst activity increased in the following cycles fig s4 this increase in activity is likely related to catalyst activation as shown in a previous study elevated temperature pretreatment of catalysts with either inert n2 or reducing h2 gas environment improved the activity of ru c by desorbing synthesis residue and exposing redox labile ru species huo et al 2017 icp analysis of the filtrate from catalyst suspension after the reaction detected trace amounts of ru 0 2 of the total amount of ru however it is unclear whether the detected ru resulted from metal dissolution or the release of loosely bound ru nanoparticles from attrition these results demonstrated that ru c can be recycled in a semi batch reactor and catalyst deactivation through leaching or fouling is insignificant over four use cycles further study ideally in packed bed continuous flow reactors is required to more thoroughly determine the longer term stability of ru c as well as process consumables and wastes during brine treatment and resource recovery applications the time on stream performance of catalytic hydrogenation in flow reactors bergquist et al 2017b chaplin et al 2009 mendow et al 2011 including measures of nitrate hydrogenation activity ammonia selectivity and catalyst deactivation rates will also be valuable for techno economic analysis to optimize process design and identify critical cost drivers to guide further process development and optimization efforts it has been reported that hydrogenation metal catalysts strongly adsorb sulfide species angeles wedler et al 2008 chaplin et al 2006 which would lead to rapid catalyst poisoning if it were occurring in the system therefore prevention of biological sulfate reduction in the brine recycling system will be critical to sustained operation membrane distillation or membrane contactor has been considered a cost effective energy efficient technology for removing ammonia from industrial and agricultural wastewater darestani et al 2017 xie et al 2009 this study provided the first demonstration of its successful application to recovering ammonia from ix waste brine the high ammonia removal efficiency observed in this study is related to the large membrane surface area high feed flow rate and prevailing high solution ph as nitrate hydrogenation naturally raises solution ph eq 1 the membrane distillation process can benefit from an upstream catalytic reactor operated without ph control which also saves the cost on alkali for adjusting ph for membrane distillation alternative membrane distillation configuration should be assessed to further improve unit efficiency and reduce membrane cost qu et al 2013 a major concern during membrane distillation implementation is membrane fouling such as by particulate and organics tijing et al 2015 warsinger et al 2015 zarebska et al 2014 the risk of particulate fouling caused by catalyst particle can be reduced by filtration which is also an effective method for removing scalants that might precipitate at higher solution ph conditions e g calcium carbonate on the acid absorbent side of the membrane no solid precipitation is expected due to the high water solubility of nh4 2so4 organic fouling is of less concern for the ion exchange waste brine considering its low organic carbon content table 1 but the accumulation of organic carbon over several brine regenerant cycles may lead to fouling over long term operation and needs to be evaluated further studies of membrane fouling during long term operation of the hybrid treatment system is recommended 4 conclusions this work demonstrated a hybrid catalytic hydrogenation membrane distillation process that potentially enables ion exchange waste brine reuse and captures nitrogen in the form of fertilizer product a commercial ru c catalyst much lower in cost than widely studied pd based catalysts was found to be active and selectively reducing nitrate to ammonia in both synthetic and real waste brine matrices the resulting ammonia product was efficiently recovered from the brine by membrane distillation as aqueous nh4 2so4 a commercial fertilizer product increased ph and temperature conditions in the feed solution increased rates of ammonia mass transfer through the gas permeable membrane while salt composition and concentrations in the brine had little effect the catalytic nitrate hydrogenation reaction naturally increases ph of treated brine thereby facilitating ammonia recovery in the subsequent membrane distillation step low grade waste heat sources if available can also be leveraged to enhance rates of both catalytic hydrogenation and membrane distillation steps demonstration of the hybrid process with a real ion exchange waste brine showed higher nitrate hydrogenation rates and similar rates of ammonia recovery compared to synthetic waste brines the higher rates of catalytic nitrate hydrogenation observed in the real waste brine suggests that trace brine components not reflected in the major ion composition can act to enhance reaction rates further studies are recommended to evaluate these factors specifically assess repeated reuse of brines for ix resin regeneration and optimize continuous flow reactor design to maximize brine treatment

18012,ion exchange is widely used to treat nitrate contaminated groundwater but high salt usage for resin regeneration and management of waste brine residuals increase treatment costs and add environmental burdens development of palladium based catalytic nitrate treatment systems for brine treatment and reuse has showed promising activity for nitrate reduction and selectivity towards the n2 over the alternative product ammonia but this strategy overlooks the potential value of nitrogen resources here we evaluated a hybrid catalytic hydrogenation membrane distillation process for nitrogen resource recovery during treatment and reuse of nitrate contaminated waste ion exchange brines in the first step of the hybrid process a ru c catalyst with high selectivity towards ammonia was found to be effective for nitrate hydrogenation under conditions representative of waste brines including expected salt buildup that would occur with repeated brine reuse cycles the apparent rate constants normalized to metal mass 0 30 0 03 mm min 1 gru 1 under baseline condition were comparable to the state of the art bimetallic pd catalyst in the second stage of the hybrid process membrane distillation was applied to recover the ammonia product from the brine matrix capturing nitrogen as ammonium sulfate a commercial fertilizer product solution ph significantly influenced the rate of ammonia mass transfer through the gas permeable membrane by controlling the fraction of free ammonia species nh3 present in the solution the rate of ammonia recovery was not affected by increasing salt levels in the brine indicating the feasibility of membrane distillation for recovering ammonia over repeated reuse cycles finally high rates of nitrate hydrogenation apparent rate constant 1 80 0

camargo and alonso 2006 in particular nitrate in drinking water has been recognized as a human health hazard for which health guidelines and regulations have been established to protect populations and limit adverse effects as a result there has been a considerable interest in developing effective and sustainable treatment technologies for nitrate impacted drinking water sources chen et al 2019 garcia segura et al 2018 huo et al 2017 martínez et al 2017 ion exchange ix is an effective process for nitrate contaminated groundwater documented at many drinking water treatment plants kapoor and viraraghavan 1997 one of the major challenges of using ix is brine management due to their finite exchange capacities anion exchange resins aer require periodic regeneration using a concentrated salt brine solution commonly sodium chloride or sodium bicarbonate this process consumes large quantities of salt since only a fraction of the nacl used to prepare fresh brine solutions adsorbs to the resin during regeneration pintar et al 2001 in addition the regeneration step produces a nitrate contaminated waste brine stream that requires disposal or further treatment bergquist et al 2017a jensen and darby 2016 the low salt use efficiency and waste brine disposal are significant contributors to operation and maintenance o m costs for ix treatment wang et al 2011 thus strategies to increase salt use efficiency i e percentage of the salt applied ending up on the regenerated resin and minimize brine waste volumes are critical to improving the economics and environmental sustainability of ix processes for drinking water treatment transforming nitrate to gaseous species e g n2 or aqueous species that have much lower affinity for the aer e g cationic nh4 can potentially enable brine recycling and minimize net salt inputs the highly oxidized state of nitrogen in nitrate v allows it to be reductively transformed either biologically chemically or catalytically doudrick et al 2013 mellor et al 1992 wang et al 2006 yang and lee 2005 ye et al 2017 in recent years catalytic hydrogenation has emerged as a promising technology for nitrate reduction wherein supported metal catalysts most often palladium based bimetallic catalysts chen et al 2003 constantinou et al 2006 jung et al 2014 sá and vinek 2005 xie et al 2011 promote nitrate reduction using h2 as a bulk reductant advantages of this technology include short start up times fast reactions use of a clean reducing agent that can be produced renewably h2 low risk of bacterial contamination and minimal production of contaminated disposals bergquist et al 2016 chen et al 2003 choe et al 2013 2015 martínez et al 2017 papa et al 2014 many research efforts have focused on identifying catalysts and operating conditions that selectively convert nitrate to gaseous n2 while minimizing formation of the alternative end product ammonia supported bimetallic pd catalysts e g pd cu pd in pd sn have been most extensively studied due to their high activity and tunable selectivity towards n2 chen et al 2003 constantinou et al 2006 jung et al 2014 sá and vinek 2005 xie et al 2011 while generally effective for treatment of a variety of nitrate containing water matrices recent studies show that nitrate reactions with some catalysts can be markedly inhibited by some natural water constituents that competitively adsorb to reactive surface sites chaplin et al 2006 pintar et al 1998 wang et al 2009 and reduced reaction rates for pd in catalysts have been documented in recent studies examining treatment of ix waste brine matrices bergquist et al 2016 2017a choe et al 2015 while catalytic nitrate reduction to gaseous n2 eliminates nitrogen residuals from the treated water this strategy represents a downcycling step that fails to capture any value embedded in the fixed nitrogen species present in the contaminated water nitrate reduction to the alternative product ammonia has typically been deemed undesirable bergquist et al 2016 dortsiou et al 2009 pintar et al 2001 yang et al 2013 but ammonia has potential value as fertilizer products e g anhydrous ammonia ammonium sulfate if a suitable process for recovering the endproduct can be identified e g volatilization and trapping of nh3 opportunities for recovering ammonia are most practical in matrices where nitrate has been concentrated like ix waste brines where nitrogen concentrations can reach 1000 mg l 1 bae et al 2002 mcadam and judd 2008 yang et al 2013 thus selective reduction of nitrate in ix waste brines to ammonia provides a potential pathway for recycling fixed nitrogen species as fertilizer products during water treatment at the same time removal of nitrate from the waste brine can enable reuse of the waste brine and significantly reduce net salt input requirements for the overall ix treatment processes in this work we introduce a hybrid ion exchange catalytic hydrogenation membrane distillation ix ch md pathway to simultaneously reduce salt input requirements and waste brine discharge volume while recovering nitrogen resources when treating nitrate contaminated water sources fig 1 here we focused on characterizing the waste brine management steps in the hybrid process specifically we assessed 1 treatment of nitrate contaminated ix waste brines using ru c an alternative to more costly pd based catalysts which we recently reported exhibits complete selectivity to ammonia when treating nitrate in freshwater matrices huo et al 2017 and 2 recovery of the resulting ammonia product from brine as ammonium sulfate a potentially valuable fertilizer product amaral et al 2016 garcia gonzález and vanotti 2015 li et al 2018 using membrane distillation experiments were conducted using both synthetic waste brine mimicking conditions reported in earlier studies as well as a real waste brine obtained from a drinking water utility that uses ix to treat nitrate contaminated groundwater the influence of key operating variables on the individual steps in the hybrid process were examined and findings provide a path forward for development of the hybrid process to simultaneously enable reuse of waste ix brines and reduce waste discharges while recovering a potentially valuable product stream 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials a commercial ru catalyst immobilized on carbon powder ru c nominal 5 wt ru was purchased from sigma aldrich and used as received previous characterization showed that the catalyst exhibits high surface area 860 m2 g 1 and ru metal dispersion 38 and h2 temperature programmed reduction and co chemisorption indicate surface ru is present predominantly in the metallic state under reaction conditions detailed characterization of this material was described elsewhere huo et al 2017 sodium nitrate and ammonium chloride were also obtained from sigma aldrich acs grade sodium sulfate sodium bicarbonate ammonium hydroxide

air waste ix brine was collected from a drinking water treatment plant in california composition of the waste brine is summarized in table 1 2 2 catalytic hydrogenation experiments to determine the influence of operating parameters on nitrate hydrogenation reactions kinetic studies were first conducted in synthetic brine solutions using a procedure adapted from a previous study huo et al 2017 a predetermined mass of ru c and a test solution 120 ml with desired background salt nacl nahco3 and or na2so4 concentrations were added to a 250 ml three neck flask equipped with rubber stoppers and a teflon coated magnetic stir bar fig 2 a initial rates were collected for the ru c loading ranging from 1 to 7 5 g l 1 to identify the conditions under which external mass transfer limitations are absent at the selected stirring speed 1100 rpm prior to initiating the reaction with nitrate ru c in aqueous suspension was maintained under 1 atm h2 headspace overnight by flowing excess h2 gas through the reactor 300 ml min 1 while continuously stirring the pretreatment duration was chosen to accommodate reactor schedule and a shorter duration will likely be acceptable and can be confirmed in future process optimization studies reaction was initiated by adding a small volume of concentrated nano3 stock solution 5 m to achieve the designed initial nitrate concentration 50 200 mm and reaction progress was tracked by periodically collecting aliquots of the catalyst suspension 1 5 ml for analysis collected aliquots were immediately filtered 0 45 μm cellulose acetate to quench the reaction reaction temperature was maintained with a circulating external water bath calibrated by an external thermometer the change of solution ph over the course of reaction was monitored orion double junction combination ph electrode calibrated by standard nist buffers apparent ph values were reported in the case where the effect of ph on reactions was evaluated solution ph was maintained by an automatic ph stat metrohm using hcl the collected filtrate aliquots were diluted with deionized water and analyzed for nitrate nitrite and or ammonia concentrations all experiments were performed in duplicate and uncertainties are reported as standard deviations the procedure for measuring catalytic hydrogenation of nitrate in real waste brine was modified to avoid the complication of nitrate reduction occurring during the period where the catalyst was pre exposed to h2 gas overnight prior to the reaction a small volume ru c slurry 0 6 g ru c in 10 ml deionized water was reduced overnight under h2 flow 300 ml min 1 at room temperature reaction was then initiated by introducing 100 ml of the waste brine to a flask containing the pre reduced catalyst as a control experiments were also conducted in a synthetic brine prepared to mimic the major ion composition of the real waste brine table 1 for tests where co2 g was used to buffer ph of the brine during treatment co2 gas was introduced to the reactor at 65 ml min 1 the rest of the procedure follows the description provided above a catalyst recycle experiment was also carried out to evaluate the reusability of ru c for waste brine treatment at the end of the reaction the catalyst was collected by filtering the suspension with a membrane filter 0 45 μm cellulose acetate rinsed with deionized water several times and dried in air at 70 c before reusing in the next reaction cycle 2 3 membrane distillation experiments a bench scale membrane distillation assembly was operated in direct contact batch mode to recover ammonia from synthetic brine and real waste brine that was first catalytically treated to reduce nitrate to ammonia fig 2b ammonia containing brine solutions were on the feed side and sulfuric acid 0 25 m was used on the absorbent side of the membrane assembly the membrane cell was custom made acrylic plastic cell and spacers were used in both the feed and the acid absorbent channels of the cell the cell was outfitted with a hydrophobic microporous membrane provided by bha altair llc ql822 the membrane is a polypropylene backed ptfe material with a nominal pore size of 0 45 μm with the functional layer in contact with the feed three cells each with a surface area of 195 cm2 were used in series the experiments were performed using co current flow to minimize the local pressure differential across the membrane the feed stream was pumped continuously during operation using a positive displacement gear pump micropump integral series idex corp vancouver wa the acid absorbent stream was also pumped continuously using a peristaltic pump masterflex l s series cole parmer usa flow rates of the feed and the acid absorbent were kept equal a heat exchanger was used to control the temperature of the feed brine stream tests were conducted prior to ammonia recovery experiments to validate membrane integrity and ensure that the membranes were not wetted four liters of brine feed solution was used for each experiment the concentration of h2so4 in the acid absorbent 0 25 m 1 2 l was designed to be excessive to ensure complete capture of ammonia passing through the membrane as nh4 2so4 kinetic studies were conducted with synthetic solutions to examine the impact of operating parameters on ammonia recovery the synthetic solutions were prepared by dissolving predetermined amount of salts nacl nahco3 and or na2so4 ammonia aqueous solution and base naoh in deionized water the amount of ammonia in aqueous solutions and naoh was determined by assuming complete hydrogenation of nitrate according to the following stoichiometry eq 1 1 no 3 4 h 2 nh 3 oh 2 h 2 o time zero was recorded once the feed reached the designed temperature heat up time 1 2 min and the test duration was 60 min feed solution was sampled 8 10 ml periodically to track the change of total ammonia concentration i e nh4 nh3 for selected tests acid absorbent solution was also sampled 1 ml to quantify the mass balance on ammonia in the system the initial and final ph values of the feed were also recorded batch experiments were performed in duplicate and uncertainties are reported as standard deviations the procedure for catalytically treated real waste brine was the same as for synthetic brine 2 4 aqueous analysis anions including cl no3 so4 2 no2 and po4 3 were quantified by ion chromatography with conductivity detection ics 90 dionex sunnyvale ca metals were quantified by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy icp aes optima 5300 perkinelmer fremont ca icp aes samples were acidified with nitric acid to a ph 2 before analysis total ammonia nh3 nh4 was analyzed by colorimetric analysis hach salicylate method alkalinity was measured by titration with 1 n h2so4 total organic carbon toc and inorganic carbon were determined using a total organic carbon analyzer shimadzu toc l columbia md 3 results and discussion 3 1 synthetic brine catalytic nitrate hydrogenation catalytic hydrogenation with ru c was initially evaluated in synthetic brine solutions prepared at conditions representative of nitrate contaminated waste ix brines designed to assess the influence of major anions and operating conditions tests showed that the initial rate of nitrate hydrogenation increased linearly with the catalyst loading ranging from 1 to 7 5 g l 1 fig s1 consistent with negligible external mass transfer limitations huo et al 2017 rao et al 1998 ruppert et al 2009 however the possibility of internal mass transfer limitations within the catalyst particles cannot be ruled out which is an inherent challenge for porous catalyst materials choe et al 2015 a catalyst loading of 5 g l 1 was then selected for use in subsequent experiments fig 3 shows the time profile of nitrate hydrogenation observed under the baseline testing conditions 100 mm initial nitrate concentration 5 g l 1 ru c in 5 wt nacl 100 mm nahco3 100 mm na2so4 30 c no ph control the rate of nitrate hydrogenation appeared to be constant for the first half life although this observation alone is not sufficient to formally establish reaction order we calculated apparent zero order rate constants using data collected for the first half life to facilitate comparison of catalyst activity under different feed solution chemistries and operating conditions within the given system and also with catalyst activities reported in literature bergquist et al 2016 choe et al 2015 2 n o 3 n o 3 0 k 0 m r u t where no 3 o is the initial aqueous nitrate concentration mm no 3 is the aqueous nitrate concentration at reaction time t min and k 0 is the apparent zero order rate constant normalized to ru metal mass in the reactor suspension mm min 1 gru 1 and m ru is the mass loading of active ru metal in the aqueous suspension gru l 1 under the baseline testing condition k 0 was found to be 0 30 0 03 mm min 1 gru 1 this value falls within the same order of magnitude as values reported for pd in c catalysts using a similar semi batch reactor 0 18 0 81 mm min 1 gpd 1 choe et al 2015 indicating comparable activity and feasibility for treating waste ix brine with ru based catalysts this finding is also notable because market costs for ru have historically been much lower than pd chen et al 2017 huo et al 2017 vardon et al 2017 ammonia was the only product in the liquid phase but nitrogen mass balance closure was hindered by nh3 transfer to the flowing h2 in the headspace we confirmed the selective nitrate reduction to ammonia based on real ix waste brine treatment results as shown later the values of k 0 measured in synthetic brines of varying composition are summarized in table 2 an inverse dependence was observed between k 0 and initial nitrate concentration reducing the initial nitrate concentration from 100 mm to 50 mm resulted in k 0 increasing from 0 30 to 0 70 mm min 1 gru 1 while increasing the initial nitrate concentration to 200 mm resulted in k 0 decreasing to 0 08 mm min 1 gru 1 this trend suggests that the zero order behavior observed for individual batch reactions may not represent the inherent nitrate hydrogenation kinetics considering the potential influence of products on reaction rates a more formal approach to study kinetics in batch reactor is to examine the relationship between initial rate and initial concentrations ngo et al 2018 tadepalli et al 2007 3 d n o 3 0 d t k n o 3 0 a h 2 0 b 4 ln d n o 3 0 d t a ln n o 3 0 b ln h 2 0 ln k where k is the rate constant a and b are the reaction orders for nitrate and hydrogen respectively and h 2 o is the initial aqueous concentration of hydrogen which is proportional to hydrogen partial pressure in the gas phase according to henry s law because k and h 2 o are constant in the current system a can be obtained from the slope of plotting the natural log of initial nitrate hydrogenation rate versus the natural log of initial nitrate concentration a value of 1 5 was obtained for a over the range of nitrate concentration tested in this study fig s2 which indicates the saturation of the catalyst surface with nitrate and therefore blocking h2 adsorption nijhuis et al 2002 the non integer is challenging to be completely rationalized and further study of initial rates with well controlled system free of non target ions e g nacl is needed to develop a more formal kinetic model for catalytic nitrate reduction in brine solutions because the nitrate hydrogenation reaction generates oh as a product eq 1 solution ph increases as nitrate hydrogenation proceeds in the absence of an appropriate buffer under the baseline condition solution ph increased from an initial value of 9 5 to a final value of 12 6 by the end of the reaction fig 3 to evaluate the potential influence of solution ph on nitrate hydrogenation apparent zero order rate constants were determined for reactions where ph was maintained at circumneutral ph conditions ph 7 5 and basic ph conditions ph 11 by automatic ph stat with hcl addition similar reaction rate constants were observed at both ph conditions table 2 with k 0 only increasing by 20 at the higher ph conditions at first glance the limited effect of changing solution ph appears to contradict findings reported previously for the same catalyst reacting with lower initial nitrate concentrations e g 1 6 mm instead of 100 mm where the first order reaction constant decreased at basic conditions huo et al 2017 however the differing ph dependent trends can be attributed to how ph affects the concentration of nitrate adsorbing to catalyst surfaces at different nitrate concentrations with increasing ph the catalyst surfaces become more negatively charged due to deprotonation of acidic surface functional groups on the support and accumulation of oh on the metal surface abdelrahman et al 2015 inhibiting electrostatic attraction and decreasing affinity for adsorption of oxyanions like nitrate at lower nitrate concentrations in the solution phase this can inhibit reaction of nitrate with adsorbed atomic hydrogen by decreasing the pre equilibrium concentrations of adsorbed nitrate chen et al 2010 epron et al 2002 wang et al 2014 while the intrinsic affinity of nitrate for adsorption to the surface is still likely reduced when higher initial nitrate concentrations are used the very high concentration of nitrate in the solution 100 mm is still sufficient to drive the nitrate adsorption to achieve high nitrate surface coverage as a result the apparent rate of nitrate hydrogenation is little affected by the change in solution ph conditions three major non target anions in waste brines and reused brines i e chloride bicarbonate and sulfate table 1 were then systematically evaluated for their influence on nitrate hydrogenation activity with ru c removal of all three anions from the solution led to a 50 decrease in k 0 from 0 30 to 0 15 mm min 1 gru 1 table 2 similar reductions in k 0 were found in the ph buffered experiments mentioned above where the three ions had also been removed from the matrix collectively these observations indicate that either increases in overall salinity of the water promotes catalyst reactivity with nitrate or that more specific interaction involving one or more of the major anions acts to promote nitrate reactions subsequent experiments suggest that the bicarbonate anion component is particularly important to catalytic reactions with nitrate the rate constant measured in brine prepared without the bicarbonate component 0 16 mm min 1 gru 1 was similar to the value measured in the absence of all three major anions 0 15 mm min 1 gru 1 whereas the rate constant measured in solution containing only the bicarbonate component 0 58 mm min 1 gru 1 was nearly four times the value measured with no brine components and twice the value measured in the baseline brine condition where all three major anions were present on the other hand doubling the chloride and sulfate components decreased k 0 from 0 30 to 0 10 mm min 1 gru 1 collectively these findings indicate that chloride and sulfate anions competitively inhibit nitrate reactions with ru c but bicarbonate anions serve to promote increased catalytic reactions of nitrate the inhibitory effects of chloride and sulfate are consistent with observations reported for pd based catalysts bergquist et al 2016 choe et al 2015 pintar et al 1998 which are attributed to competitive inhibition of nitrate adsorption the reason for enhanced reactivity in the presence of elevated concentrations of bicarbonate is less clear this ion differs from the other two in that it possesses a labile proton 5 hco 3 h co 3 2 p k a 10 33 nitrate reduction to ammonia consumes h eq 1 so it is possible that bicarbonate can serve as a proton donor in the rate determining step on the overall reaction thereby increasing the apparent rate of nitrate hydrogenation lastly increasing solution temperature from 25 to 35 c showed a positive effect on k 0 table 2 similar to reports of nitrate reduction with pd based catalysts kim et al 2016 soares et al 2012 arrhenius plot of the data yielded an apparent activation energy ea of 45 6 kj mol 1 comparable to ea reported for nitrate hydrogenation with a pd cu al2o3 catalyst pintar et al 1996 in sum the nitrate hydrogenation experiments conducted in synthetic brine solutions support the technical feasibility of applying ru c catalyst for reduction of nitrate ions present in ix waste brines the effects of different constituents and operating conditions on reaction kinetics will inform future process design efforts for example waste heat sources if present may be leveraged to improve reaction rates which can also benefit subsequent recovery of ammonia by membrane distillation as discussed below 3 2 synthetic brine ammonia recovery by membrane distillation catalytic nitrate hydrogenation with ru c generates an ammonia rich brine the ammonia is then removed from the brine by membrane distillation and recovered as nh4 2so4 in a h2so4 trap solution fig 2b a similar approach to that used for catalytic hydrogenation studies was employed to evaluate ammonia recovery from synthetic waste ix brines by membrane distillation and identify the effects of important operating factors under the baseline testing conditions a synthetic brine feed was designed to have the same composition as the baseline testing solution for catalytic hydrogenation with the exception that nitrate is assumed to be hydrogenated stoichiometrically to ammonia according to eq 1 solution conditions including salt levels solution ph initial ammonia concentration and temperature were evaluated for their impact on ammonia recovery efficiency initial testing was used to select 1 5 l min 1 feed flow rate to allow for good mixing conditions at the boundary layer qu et al 2013 while maintaining the system at low pressure 7 5 psig to reduce the risk of wetting the membranes qi and cussler 1985 under the baseline conditions the kinetics of ammonia removal from the feed followed a first order rate law over the entire reaction time course fig 4 nitrogen mass balance closure was achieved when summing the total ammonia concentrations in the feed and acid absorbent sides of the membrane indicating that the system was well sealed and loss of ammonia to void spaces in the system was negligible the membranes employed in membrane distillation process are hydrophobic allowing vapor phase species to permeate while rejecting ionic constituents in the aqueous feed also because the temperatures of the feed and absorbent solutions were the same in the baseline testing conditions the driving force for ammonia mass transfer was only the difference in ammonia partial vapor pressure between the feed and the acid absorbent the latter was maintained at a minimum by trapping the absorbed ammonia in the protonated ammonium state that predominates in acidic solutions 6 nh4 h nh3 pk a 9 25 the feed solution ph decreased from 11 2 to 10 8 as the ammonia was removed consistent with removal of a base species from solution tao and ukwuani 2015 with very few exceptions feed solution ph remained 10 7 during the tests where free ammonia species predominates 96 table 3 due to the relatively low temperatures studied no higher than 35 c for all tests water evaporation through the membranes was not expected to be significant therefore the mass flux of ammonia j nh3 gnh3 n m 2 h 1 from the feed to the acid absorbent can be represented by the following equation 7 j n h 3 k m d n h 3 f where k md is the overall mass transfer coefficient m h 1 and nh 3 f is the concentration of free ammonia in the feed solution mgnh3 n l 1 the overall mass transfer coefficient comprises three resistances i e feed liquid side boundary resistance membrane resistance and acid absorbent side boundary resistance and depends on the membrane and operating conditions zarebska et al 2014 practically the value of k md can be determined by the following equation du preez et al 2005 el bourawi et al 2007 zarebska et al 2014 8 k m d v a t ln n h 3 f 0 n h 3 f where v is the total volume of the feed m3 a is the membrane area m2 nh 3 f 0 is the initial concentration of ammonia in the feed mm and nh 3 f is the ammonia concentration in the feed at time t h by plotting ln nh 3 f 0 nh 3 f versus time a straight line with the slope of k md a v was obtained and subsequently k md was determined the initial j n h 3 was then calculated from eq 7 under the baseline condition the initial j nh3 was found to be 268 gnh3 n m 2 h 1 with the corresponding k md of 0 19 m h 1 table 3 direct comparison of kinetic parameters observed in this study with those reported in the literature is challenging because rates of ammonia mass transfer strongly depend on several factors including system configuration and geometry membrane properties and hydrodynamic characteristics of the system arogo et al 1999 bennett and myers 1983 lauterböck et al 2013 qi and cussler 1985 consequently ammonia mass transfer coefficients using model ammonia aqueous solution by membrane contactors vary over a few orders of magnitude e g 10 5 m s 1 10 4 m h 1 ding et al 2006 zhu et al 2005 10 3 m h 1 ahn et al 2011 and 0 62 cm s 1 0 37 m h 1 qi and cussler 1985 the k md values measured in this study fall on the higher end of values reported even so ammonia recovery under different feed solution chemistry and operating conditions can be compared within the given system variable salt concentration and composition in the brine feed solutions 0 10 wt for nacl 0 200 mm for na2so4 had only a minor effect on ammonia mass transfer table 3 increasing ionic strength has slightly negative effect on the fraction of free ammonia species present at a given ph condition bower and bidwell 1978 however at the relatively high ph conditions 10 7 1 45 ph units above the pk a used in these tests the fraction of free ammonia species remained high rendering the effect of ionic strength insignificant during catalytic nitrate hydrogenation solution ph and free ammonia concentration were inherently coupled due to the hydroxide generated during the reaction eq 1 in addition ph of the brine solution was influenced by the buffering capacity of the solution during catalytic hydrogenation accordingly four test conditions were designed that combined two factors relevant to solution ph i e ammonia concentration and bicarbonate concentration each at two levels to simplify the synthetic solution preparation we added pre determined amounts of ammonia bicarbonate and hydroxide following reaction stoichiometry eq 1 assuming complete nitrate hydrogenation without loss of ammonia to the gas phase at relatively low buffering capacity e g 50 mm initial ammonia and 50 mm initial bicarbonate feed solution ph was 11 and measured k md 0 20 m h 1 was similar to that observed for the baseline testing condition table 3 on the other hand when the brine was initially more strongly buffered at circumneutral ph conditions e g 50 mm initial ammonia and 200 mm initial bicarbonate feed solution for membrane distillation had a lower initial ph value with an apparent solution ph of 9 2 a condition wherein only 50 of the ammonia is present as the free ammonia species and 50 as nh4 the measured value of k md calculated based upon total ammonia concentration decreased 51 table 3 suggesting that feed solution ph can strongly influence rates of ammonia mass transfer for brines with higher initial ammonia concentration e g 200 mm solution ph was generally higher 11 and measured k md values were again comparable with that observed for the baseline testing condition table 3 the initial j nh3 was observed to increase with the initial ammonia concentration which was expected from eq 8 as expected increasing temperature of the feed solution also had a positive effect on ammonia mass transfer for example k md decreased from the baseline condition 30 c to 0 16 m h 1 when temperature was reduced to 25 c and increased to 0 23 m h 1 when temperature was increased to 35 c table 3 this influence of temperature observed was consistent with literature findings with various membrane distillation configurations including vacuum and sweep gas membrane distillation ding et al 2006 wu et al 2016 xie et al 2009 with increasing feed solution temperature solute diffusivity increases ammonia solubility decreases and dissociation equilibrium is disturbed to favor dissociation which all can contribute to higher mass transfer rates arogo et al 1999 however increasing feed temperature to accelerate ammonia mass transfer will be increasingly limited at higher temperatures because the mass transfer of water vapor through the membrane is intensified compromising ammonia selectivity xie et al 2009 although membrane distillation has previously been explored for ammonia removal from wastewater its application in a concentrated brine matrix such as waste ix brine was evaluated for the first time in this study the relatively high k md values reported here indicate that the chosen membrane has desirable properties for such applications and the system geometry and liquid flow rate imparted thin liquid boundary layer to minimize mass transfer resistance similar to previous studies high feed solution ph and temperature were identified as critical variable for ammonia mass transfer further sensitivity analysis will be useful to optimize process operation by determining the relative changes of ammonia mass transfer coefficient per unit change of operating factor arogo et al 1999 3 3 demonstration of nitrate removal and ammonia recovery from real waste brine based on the results obtained in synthetic brines we conducted a demonstration of nitrate reduction and ammonia recovery with a real ion exchange waste brine obtained from a utility in california treating nitrate contaminated groundwater table 1 catalytic nitrate hydrogenation in the waste brine followed a zero order rate law fig 5 similar to synthetic brine solutions however the measured k 0 value was found to be significantly higher 1 80 0 04 mm min 1 gru 1 than the values measured in the synthetic brines table 2 as a control reaction was conducted in a synthetic waste brine with the same concentrations of major anions chloride nitrate and sulfate alkalinity by adding sodium bicarbonate and initial solution ph adjusted with naoh as the real waste brine interestingly the k 0 value measured in this synthetic mimic waste brine was 30 lower 1 24 0 02 mm min 1 gru 1 than the value measured in the real waste brine these results verify the technical feasibility of applying ru c for nitrate hydrogenation in ion exchange waste brine still further research is needed to identify the origin of the faster nitrate hydrogenation kinetics observed in the real waste brine it is noted that the real waste brine contains multiple minor constituents that are absent in the synthetic waste brine for example the sole cation used in the preparation of synthetic waste brine is na while the real waste brine contains several divalent and trivalent cations e g ca2 mg2 which have previously been shown to enhance rates of nitrate hydrogenation pintar et al 1998 in addition trace organics and metals in the real waste brine may interact with catalyst surfaces to enhance nitrate reactivity hörold et al 1993 liu et al 2014 moyer and meyer 1979 considering that bicarbonate showed positive influence on nitrate hydrogenation kinetics table 2 tests were conducted to co feed co2 with h2 which is a common practice for ph control when treating nitrate with pd based catalysts bergquist et al 2016 choe et al 2015 the nitrate hydrogenation rate was comparable with that in the absence of co2 for the first 0 5 h but the rate gradually decreased with further reaction time fig 5 this observation could be a result of lower hydrogen partial pressure and the accumulation of anionic bicarbonate and carbonate over time to compete with nitrate for active site adsorption for example the inorganic carbon concentration increased from 238 mm to 466 mm after 12 h of treatment on the other hand co feeding co2 significantly improved retention of ammonia in the open reactor system by maintaining solution ph between 7 6 and 7 9 where ionic nh4 predominates over the free ammonia species after 8 h of reaction 85 of the ammonia was retained in the liquid phase when co feeding co2 compared to only 51 in the absence of co2 buffer where ph increased to 10 0 allowing conversion of nh4 to the volatile nh3 species fig s3 to provide sufficient feed solution for the membrane distillation experiments catalytic hydrogenation of real waste brine was scaled up in 1 l reactors from 0 25 l flasks in experiments discussed to this point reaction was conducted for up to 24 h while co feeding co2 to maximize ammonia retention in the liquid phase these conditions resulted in near complete nitrate hydrogenation and the liquid phase retained 90 of the ammonia reaction product table 4 salt composition analysis showed no loss of chloride and sulfate while inorganic carbon concentration increased due to co2 absorption table 4 further reactor optimization can be used to improve reaction kinetics but this is beyond the scope of the present proof of concept study following catalytic reaction and just prior to beginning the membrane distillation experiment the solution ph was adjusted to 10 0 with naoh to better reflect the ph conditions observed when ph was allowed to drift without co2 buffer fig 6 a shows the observed kinetics of ammonia removal from the catalytically treated real waste brine and a synthetic brine prepared with the same major ion composition total ammonia and ph as the treated real waste brine ammonia removal in both brine matrices were similar and followed a first order model model fit of data collected in real waste brine yielded k md and j nh3 values of 0 11 m h 1 and 199 gnh3 n m 2 h 1 respectively limited supplies of the catalytically treated waste brine prevented replicate experiments this is similar to values measured in the synthetic brine k md 0 12 0 01 m h 1 and j nh3 225 4 gnh3 n m 2 h 1 and the k md value was of the same order of values obtained with other synthetic solutions table 3 good nitrogen mass balance closure was also observed by summing the total ammonia concentrations in the waste brine feed and acid absorbent solutions fig 6b salt composition and concentrations after membrane distillation were almost invariant table 4 verifying membrane integrity within tested operation time and high selectivity for transfer of ammonia these results indicate that membrane distillation can be an effective process for recovering ammonia from real waste brine matrices overall the hybrid catalytic hydrogenation membrane distillation process resulted in 99 removal of nitrate from the waste brine and 80 nitrogen recovery in form of aqueous nh4 2so4 small quantities of nitrogen 7 remained in the treated brine as either ammonia or nitrate and the remainder was presumed to be lost to the gas phase during semi batch catalytic reactions while further improvements in system efficiency are likely through reactor optimization findings reported here provide a proof of concept demonstration that the hybrid process can simultaneously treat nitrate contaminated waste brines and recover nitrogen as commercially viable fertilizer product 3 4 application considerations of the hybrid process compared with conventional brine treatment systems the hybrid catalytic hydrogenation membrane distillation process enables brine reuse and provides potentially valuable product through nitrogen transformation and recovery nitrogen in the form of dilute nitrate contamination present in the source water was transformed to a much more concentrated and pure nh4 2so4 solution fig 1 which can be used as a liquid fertilizer or a precursor for production of solid fertilizer amaral et al 2016 garcia gonzález and vanotti 2015 li et al 2018 this process leverages chemical potential difference as the driving force e g nitrate adsorption to ion exchange resin nitrate hydrogenation on ru surface and ammonia mass transfer across membrane and has minimal thermal energy requirement therefore it likely has higher energy efficiency compared to the traditional high energy haber bosch ammonia synthesis from n2 g the revenue from selling the nh4 2so4 product may be approximated from the quantity and market price of nh4 2so4 as an example a medium size water treatment plant 10 mgd that removes 30 mgno3 n l recovers 415 tonne nh3 n year yielding 1960 tonne nh4 2so4 year which equates an annual revenue of 284 000 with an nh4 2so4 price at 145 tonne world sulphuric acid weekly 2017 although producing nh4 2so4 through the hybrid catalytic hydrogenation membrane distillation process requires capital investment and consumption of h2 and sulfuric acid this process also reduces the costs for ix treatment by improving salt use efficiency and drastically reducing waste brine disposal costs while also limiting downstream environmental releases of nitrate wang et al 2011 therefore a full techno economic analysis and life cycle environmental impact assessment of the overall process are required to more rigorously evaluate the economics and environmental sustainability of the hybrid process demonstrated here this analysis should include important factors such as process scale and potential reductions in overall salt usage and waste discharge costs an initial conceptual evaluation of the economic and environmental viability of the catalytic hydrogenation process may be achieved by comparing the current system with a more developed brine treatment system using pd based catalysts bergquist et al 2016 choe et al 2015 previous work showed that both the o m costs and environmental impacts of recycling ix brines by treating nitrate with pd in c catalysts can be lower than those of conventional ix processes choe et al 2015 a critical factor to delivering these benefits is reducing the catalyst cost particularly the use of pd chiueh et al 2011 catalyst cost is directly associated with the cost of the active metal dominated by pd for pd in c catalysts and catalyst quantity which is determined by catalyst activity less catalyst material is required for catalysts that exhibit higher activity along this line of consideration ru catalysts have an advantage over pd based catalysts due to the historically lower cost of ru chen et al 2017 huo et al 2017 vardon et al 2017 in addition ru catalysts have been reported to have high activity for nitrate reduction similar to pd cu c catalysts huo et al 2017 this study further confirmed that ru c is active for nitrate hydrogenation in various brine conditions although comparison between ru c activity determined in this study and that of pd in c catalysts in the literature is not straightforward under different reaction conditions their apparent zero order rate constants normalized to metal mass are of similar magnitude when treating synthetic brine solutions and the rate constant with ru c for treating a real waste brine is approximately two fold higher than the highest value reported for pd in c catalysts bergquist et al 2016 choe et al 2015 all suggesting that ru catalysts have a potential to improve the economic and environmental sustainability of the catalytic treatment step of the hybrid process a less studied but critically important consideration for catalytic processes is catalyst stability and longevity catalyst longevity is ultimately required to fulfill the assumptions of catalyst lifetime usually years during techno economic analysis and life cycle assessment choe et al 2013 2015 hutchison et al 2017 catalyst stability also affects catalyst loading design for a fixed volume of waste brine and vice versa brine regeneration cycle design with a fixed loading of catalyst generally the higher the total volume of waste brine that can be treated with the catalyst the more savings that can be gained from brine reuse bergquist et al 2016 ru c stability for waste brine hydrogenation was initially assessed using a batch recycle test after the first use catalyst activity increased in the following cycles fig s4 this increase in activity is likely related to catalyst activation as shown in a previous study elevated temperature pretreatment of catalysts with either inert n2 or reducing h2 gas environment improved the activity of ru c by desorbing synthesis residue and exposing redox labile ru species huo et al 2017 icp analysis of the filtrate from catalyst suspension after the reaction detected trace amounts of ru 0 2 of the total amount of ru however it is unclear whether the detected ru resulted from metal dissolution or the release of loosely bound ru nanoparticles from attrition these results demonstrated that ru c can be recycled in a semi batch reactor and catalyst deactivation through leaching or fouling is insignificant over four use cycles further study ideally in packed bed continuous flow reactors is required to more thoroughly determine the longer term stability of ru c as well as process consumables and wastes during brine treatment and resource recovery applications the time on stream performance of catalytic hydrogenation in flow reactors bergquist et al 2017b chaplin et al 2009 mendow et al 2011 including measures of nitrate hydrogenation activity ammonia selectivity and catalyst deactivation rates will also be valuable for techno economic analysis to optimize process design and identify critical cost drivers to guide further process development and optimization efforts it has been reported that hydrogenation metal catalysts strongly adsorb sulfide species angeles wedler et al 2008 chaplin et al 2006 which would lead to rapid catalyst poisoning if it were occurring in the system therefore prevention of biological sulfate reduction in the brine recycling system will be critical to sustained operation membrane distillation or membrane contactor has been considered a cost effective energy efficient technology for removing ammonia from industrial and agricultural wastewater darestani et al 2017 xie et al 2009 this study provided the first demonstration of its successful application to recovering ammonia from ix waste brine the high ammonia removal efficiency observed in this study is related to the large membrane surface area high feed flow rate and prevailing high solution ph as nitrate hydrogenation naturally raises solution ph eq 1 the membrane distillation process can benefit from an upstream catalytic reactor operated without ph control which also saves the cost on alkali for adjusting ph for membrane distillation alternative membrane distillation configuration should be assessed to further improve unit efficiency and reduce membrane cost qu et al 2013 a major concern during membrane distillation implementation is membrane fouling such as by particulate and organics tijing et al 2015 warsinger et al 2015 zarebska et al 2014 the risk of particulate fouling caused by catalyst particle can be reduced by filtration which is also an effective method for removing scalants that might precipitate at higher solution ph conditions e g calcium carbonate on the acid absorbent side of the membrane no solid precipitation is expected due to the high water solubility of nh4 2so4 organic fouling is of less concern for the ion exchange waste brine considering its low organic carbon content table 1 but the accumulation of organic carbon over several brine regenerant cycles may lead to fouling over long term operation and needs to be evaluated further studies of membrane fouling during long term operation of the hybrid treatment system is recommended 4 conclusions this work demonstrated a hybrid catalytic hydrogenation membrane distillation process that potentially enables ion exchange waste brine reuse and captures nitrogen in the form of fertilizer product a commercial ru c catalyst much lower in cost than widely studied pd based catalysts was found to be active and selectively reducing nitrate to ammonia in both synthetic and real waste brine matrices the resulting ammonia product was efficiently recovered from the brine by membrane distillation as aqueous nh4 2so4 a commercial fertilizer product increased ph and temperature conditions in the feed solution increased rates of ammonia mass transfer through the gas permeable membrane while salt composition and concentrations in the brine had little effect the catalytic nitrate hydrogenation reaction naturally increases ph of treated brine thereby facilitating ammonia recovery in the subsequent membrane distillation step low grade waste heat sources if available can also be leveraged to enhance rates of both catalytic hydrogenation and membrane distillation steps demonstration of the hybrid process with a real ion exchange waste brine showed higher nitrate hydrogenation rates and similar rates of ammonia recovery compared to synthetic waste brines the higher rates of catalytic nitrate hydrogenation observed in the real waste brine suggests that trace brine components not reflected in the major ion composition can act to enhance reaction rates further studies are recommended to evaluate these factors specifically assess repeated reuse of brines for ix resin regeneration and optimize continuous flow reactor design to maximize brine treatment

18013,numerous genetic markers have been developed to establish microbial source tracking mst assays in the last decade however the selection of suitable markers is challenging due to a lack of understanding of fundamental factors such as sensitivity specificity and concentration in target nontarget hosts especially in east asia in this study a total of 506 faecal samples comprised of human and 12 nonhuman hosts were collected from 28 cities across china and tested for marker performance characteristics we firstly tested 40 host associated markers based on a binary presence absence criterion here 15 markers 7 human associated 4 pig associated 3 ruminant associated and 1 poultry associated showed potential applicability in our study area the selected 15 markers were then tested using qualitative and quantitative methods to characterise their performance overall bacteroidales markers presented higher sensitivity and concentrations in target samples compared to other bacterial or viral markers but their specificity was low among nontarget samples pets accounted for 43 7 and 35 7 of cross reactivity with human associated and poultry associated markers respectively noncommon animals including horse and donkey contributed 61 3 of cross reactivity with ruminant associated markers when considering the quantitative distribution of markers their concentration in nontarget samples were 1 3 orders of magnitude lower than in target samples moreover a novel classification method was proposed to classify the nontarget hosts into four groups spanning no cross reactivity weak cross reactivity moderate cross reactivity and strong cross reactivity animal hosts there were 77 9 nontarget samples identified as no cross reactivity and weak cross reactivity hosts suggesting that these nontarget hosts produce little interference for corresponding markers our findings elucidate the performance of host associated markers around china in a qualitative and quantitative manner and reveal the interference degree of cross reactivity from nontarget animals to genetic markers which will facilitate tracking of multiple faecal pollution sources and planning timely remedial strategies in china graphical abstract image 1 keywords faecal pollution microbial source tracking genetic marker quantitative pcr china 1 introduction microbial source tracking mst is a tool used to discriminate faecal pollution from different source hosts this method presents an advantage over the traditional faecal indicator bacteria fib approach fib approach generally cannot determine the source of faecal pollution because fib are widely present in most warm blooded animal faeces reischer et al 2013 mayer et al 2018 another limitation of monitoring fib is that these bacteria can reproduce in aquatic environments alongside aquatic bacteria zhang et al 2018 which may confound pollution assessment therefore library independent mst methods which rely on the measurement of genetic markers targeting certain host associated gut microorganisms have become increasingly prominent reischer et al 2013 harwood et al 2014 feng and mclellan 2019 the presence of these genetic markers in a watershed indicates faecal pollution from specific hosts in environmental waters ahmed et al 2019a b furthermore most genetic markers were developed from obligate anaerobes and therefore degrade rapidly outside a host intestine bonjoch et al 2005 specific genetic markers such as host associated bacteroidales 16s rrna gene markers have been developed to discriminate the sources of faecal pollution from humans ahmed et al 2010a pigs mieszkin et al 2009 ruminants bernhard and field 2000 poultry green et al 2012 common pets kildare et al 2007 seagulls lu et al 2008 and other animals the performance of these markers is a key determinant in accurately identifying the source of faecal contamination moreover the suitability and accuracy of these genetic markers are susceptible to regional variability for example hf183 is known to be highly sensitive and specific to human sourced faecal pollution in belgium seurinck et al 2005 and usa boehm et al 2013 but performed poorly in singapore and india nshimyimana et al 2017 odagiri et al 2015 the bac305 marker also exhibits high specificity to ruminant faecal pollution in one particular region but not in others bernhard and field 2000 malla et al 2018 thus the search for high performance host associated marker genes in new and varied geographical regions has become a major focus of mst research in recent years the widespread applicability of genetic markers has also been limited by the often narrow regional nature of many seminal studies that evaluated the performance of faecal markers to our knowledge only one study has reported the efficacy of gene markers two human associated two ruminant associated and one bovine associated beyond a regional context collecting faecal samples from sixteen countries across six continents reischer et al 2013 this lack of data on genetic marker performance in a broad geographical context increases the difficulty of selecting mst markers for validation in new areas with certainty the performance of markers in different locations relies on repeated testing of reference faecal samples ahmed et al 2009 bernhard and field 2000 shanks et al 2010a sensitivity and specificity the most typical evaluation endpoints are usually determined by testing the presence absence of specific markers in host samples however this approach fails to quantify the abundance of said markers in individual sources the variation of marker abundance in different host species has significant implications for accurate and in depth assessment of marker performance thus characterising these variations is of great importance reischer et al 2013 to investigate the characteristics of a range of previously reported mst markers in hosts beyond a regional context china was selected as our study area china is the second largest country in asia spanning five temperature zones from cold to tropical climates until 2018 more than 1390 billion people inhabited china moreover chinese animal husbandry rapidly developed throughout the economic great leap forward period nonetheless few studies have validated mst assays across china in the present study more than 500 faecal samples were collected from 28 cities across different regions in china when considering the composition of samples faecal pollution from human common livestock and poultry are the greatest concern moreover the markers selected for our study included but were not limited to the widely well acknowledged bacteroidales genetic markers the objectives of this study were to i characterise the performance of host associated markers based on qualitative and quantitative analysis in a broad geographical area ii determine cross reactivity between hosts and the resulting level of false positive signals for each marker and iii provide a novel classification method to quantitatively assess the degree of cross reactivity between hosts 2 materials and methods 2 1 faecal sample collection from 2018 to 2019 a total of 506 faecal samples were collected from human volunteers and nonhuman hosts in 28 cities across china the sampling cities are shown in fig 1 most of the sample sites were distributed across seven major river systems in china except for those in lhasa city and urumqi city which were distributed across the continental river system of tibet and north western china respectively twenty two sampling cities were selected in south eastern china obeying the heihe tengchong geo demographic demarcation line the cities located east of said line account for the vast majority of the chinese population and consequently contribute far more faecal pollution to nearby watersheds in total 506 faecal samples were collected 117 of which were of human source 76 from pigs 102 from ruminants including cattle sheep and camels 104 from poultry including chickens ducks and geese 70 from common pet animals including dogs cats and rabbits and 37 from uncommon animals including horses and donkeys the number of faecal samples collected from each city along with their respective source species are summarized in table s1 fresh faecal samples were collected from volunteers in hospitals and from families in highly urbanised areas although some human faecal samples were collected from hospitals we applied to the doctors for faecal samples from healthy people who went to the hospital for routine physical examination rather than from patients most dog cat and rabbit faecal samples were collected from the same urban households that donated human faecal samples however a few dog cat and rabbit faeces were collected from rural households and as these animals were also living with humans they were considered as pets in this study the rest of the animal faecal material was collected from rural families livestock farms and zoos to ensure each sample came from a known source and to avoid contamination from other hosts unified sampling guidelines were defined and sent to all research partners prior to sampling in each city all faecal samples were collected using 60 ml sterile tubes collected samples were immediately placed in a sealed icebox then transported to the laboratory protected from the sunlight upon arrival to the laboratory the faecal samples were stored at 80 c until dna was extracted 2 2 dna extraction the tianamp stool dna kit tiangen beijing china was used to extract genomic dna from all faecal samples following the manufacturer recommendations for simplicity 0 25 g wet weight of each faecal sample was added into bead tubes with a lysis buffer then the samples were vigorously homogenized using a tgrinder h24 tissue homogenizer tiangen beijing china afterwards the universal dna purification kit tiangen beijing china was employed to remove polymerase chain reaction pcr inhibitors and ensure dna purity the concentration and quality of genomic dna were then measured using a nanodrop nd 1000 uv spectrophotometer maestrogen usa dna concentrations in the purified extracts were between 15 and 120 ng μl in reference to a previous study reischer et al 2013 purified dna extracts with concentrations 30 ng μl were diluted tenfold to ensure that all the purified dna extract concentrations ranged from 3 to 30 ng μl for downstream analyses and the concentrations of most dna templates were within 10 ng μl fig s1 2 3 qpcr assays and preliminary experiments all qpcr reactions were performed in triplicate on a roche lightcycler 480 ii system roche diagnostics ltd rotkreuz switzerland because we used different commercial reaction components e g polymerases than those reported in original publications all assays were run according to the recommended reaction mixtures and procedure of the used commercial kit tiangen china probe based host associated gene marker assays were performed using 20 μl qpcr mixtures containing 10 μl of 2 superreal probe premix tiangen china and 2 μl of dna template the quantities of probe and primer added were determined by their intended final concentration in the mixtures for sybr based marker assays 20 μl qpcr mixtures were prepared incorporating 10 μl 2 talent qpcr premix tiangen china 2 μl of dna template and 10 μm of each primer the protocol for probe based qpcr assays was executed according to the superreal probe premix manufacturer s instructions 95 c for 15 min followed by 40 cycles of 95 c for 3 s and 60 c for 30 s the sybr based qpcr protocol consisted of a step at 95 c for 30 min followed by 40 cycles of 95 c for 5 s and 60 c for 10 s as described in previous studies the general bacteroidetes marker allbac assay was performed to confirm the amplification of dna templates and the absence of pcr inhibition reischer et al 2013 mayer et al 2018 the detail of allbac was shown in table s2 to identify suitable host associated markers for an in depth analysis we adopted the validation method of a previous study to perform pre screening experiments targeting 40 markers table s2 fan et al 2017 these genetic markers 21 human associated 8 pig associated 7 ruminant associated and 4 poultry associated included but were not limited to the often used bacteroidales genetic markers the host associated marker selection criteria in this study were i that they targeted human pig ruminant and poultry hosts and ii that they had precedence of good performance either in the region where they were developed or in other locations the performance of the 40 markers were shown in table s3 markers with sensitivity and specificity greater than 50 were selected for further analysis among these 40 markers only fifteen markers met this criterion including 7 human associated 4 pig associated 3 ruminant associated and 1 poultry associated table 1 after pre screening experiments we performed in depth assessment for these fifteen markers quantitative analysis of these 15 markers was based on plasmid standard dilutions plasmid dna for different hosts was prepared with the respective target pcr product and primers the pgem t easy vector bgi china was used for the crassphage marker all other assays were performed with the pmd 19 t vector standard curves for all assays were generated using seven 10 fold serial dilutions of plasmid dna i e 100 106 gene copies gc the resulting qpcr efficiencies were between 90 and 110 the limits of detection lods for individual markers were calculated at 99 confidence intervals as previously described nshimyimana et al 2014 every qpcr incorporated dna template triplicates and non template controls table s4 to ensure reproducibility between different plates two standards from 102 and 103 copies μl diluted positive controls plasmid dna of each marker were tested in different plates as described in a previous study nshimyimana et al 2017 the average coefficient of variability cv was 3 87 0 87 for the 103 copies μl standard and 3 75 0 80 for the 102 copies μl standard table s5 2 4 data analysis sensitivity r and specificity s were determined according to the following equations kildare et al 2007 odagiri et al 2015 1 r tp tp fn 2 s tn tn fp tp represents positive results for target reference samples and fn represents negative results for target reference samples conversely tn indicates negative results for nontarget reference samples and fp represents positive results for nontarget reference samples in preliminary experiments the mean reaction with 31 0 cq is considered as a positive result in the 15 selected markers the qualitative performance was strictly re assessed based on the lower limit of detection lod boehm et al 2013 layton et al 2013 the concentrations of the 15 markers in target and nontarget samples were evaluated with standard curves we employed a 25th 75th metric to classify nontarget animal marker specificity and abundance into 4 groups the 25th 75th metric was determined by subtracting the 75th percentile concentration in the nontarget hosts from the 25th percentile concentration in the target hosts for each marker i e 25th 75th metric 25th percentiletarget 75th percentilenontarget reischer et al 2013 the four aforementioned groups were 1 no cross reactivity ncr the marker did not produce any positive signals in the nontarget animal 2 weak cross reactivity wcr the 25th 75th metric rendered a positive value 3 moderate cross reactivity mcr the 25th 75th metric rendered a negative value and 4 strong cross reactivity scr the disparity between the mean concentrations of target and nontarget samples was below 1 order of magnitude qpcr data were converted into a log10 format and statistical significance was determined via the t test or one way anova all data analysis was performed using microsoft excel 2010 spss 22 and the r statistical computing software 3 results to understand the potential challenges of applying markers in a wide range of geographical regions the performance of 15 promising pre selected markers was mainly discussed in the subsequent analysis of this study interestingly the results of qualitative analysis for cow specific bacteroidales bac708 and baccow markers were not only detected in cattle samples but were also highly prevalent in sheep and camel samples therefore baccow and bobac should be more generally considered ruminant associated markers rather than cow specific markers 3 1 qualitative analysis the sensitivities of all the markers tested ranged from 61 to 100 table 2 among these human associated markers had the most variable sensitivity 61 98 followed by pig associated markers 68 100 in contrast ruminant associated marker sensitivity was in the 96 100 range table 2 in human associated markers bacteroidales markers including bach bachum and sybr hf183 were the most prevalent genetic markers exhibiting host sensitivity values of 98 82 and 74 respectively mitochondrial dna markers hum2 hum 163 and crassphage markers cpq 056 cpq 064 exhibited relatively low sensitivity 59 67 moreover pig associated bacteroidales markers pig 1 bac pig 2 bac and mitochondrial marker p nd5 exhibited significantly higher sensitivity 95 100 compared to lactobacillus amylovorus markers 68 all ruminant associated markers targeted bacteroidales and showed the highest prevalence in target samples compared to other host associated markers 96 unfortunately only one poultry associated marker gfd was selected for applicability in our study from preliminary screens and the sensitivity of this marker 68 was low compared to other bacteroidales markers the specificity of the evaluated markers ranged from 50 to 91 no marker exhibited absolute host specificity but most host associated markers presented limited cross reactivity to nontarget samples except for pig 1 bac rum 2 bac and bac708 human associated markers presented the highest number of false positives occurring with pets i e 43 7 of the pet samples tested positive for seven human associated markers similarly the pets also contributed many false positive signals to the poultry associated marker gfd i e 35 7 of pet samples tested positive for the gfd marker similarly ruminant associated markers yielded the highest numbers of non common animal horse and donkey false positives with 61 3 of non common animal samples testing positive for ruminant associated markers in human associated markers bacteroidales markers exhibited lower specificity compared to mitochondrial dna markers and crassphage markers this trend was especially true for bach and bachum which exhibited host specificity values of 51 and 55 respectively among the pig associated markers the specificity value of both pig 2 bac and p nd5 were 0 90 but pig 1 bac showed relatively lower specificity 68 compared to other pig associated markers ruminant associated markers all presented low specificity 80 especially bac708 which exhibited a specificity of barely 50 in contrast gfd showed the highest specificity 91 compared to other host associated markers overall there was an apparent trade off between sensitivity and specificity in mst markers whereby an improvement in one parameter usually translated to a decrease in the other 3 2 quantitative analysis marker abundance in faecal material was characterised per gram of wet faeces as discussed in previous studies ahmed et al 2019a b nshimyimana et al 2017 layton et al 2013 the abundance of markers in target and nontarget samples were assessed based on the 25th 75th percentiles and mean concentrations mean concentrations of human associated markers in target samples ranged from 3 57 0 77 log10 gc g to 5 27 1 25 log10 gc g while the range in pig associated markers in target samples ranged from 4 99 1 79 log10 gc g to 6 58 1 59 log10 gc g ruminant associated markers had the highest concentrations ranging from 6 19 1 26 log10 gc g to 7 15 0 89 log10 gc g the poultry associated marker gfd exhibited relatively low concentrations 4 09 0 96 log10 gc g in target samples bacteroidales markers generally presented significantly higher concentrations in target samples compared to most of the other markers paired t test p 0 05 meanwhile mitochondrial marker p nd5 also exhibited high concentrations and showed no statistically significant differences in abundance with pig 1 bac paired t test p 0 05 moreover the concentrations of tested markers in target samples presented much broader distributions 25th and 75th percentiles of marker concentrations were separated by 1 4 orders of magnitude fig 2 in human associated markers 25th and 75th percentiles of bacteroidales markers were separated by 3 4 orders of magnitude which evidences a relatively broad distribution compared to mitochondrial dna and crassphage markers in contrast all ruminant associated markers presented a relatively narrow gap of 25th and 75th percentile distribution which were separated by 1 3 orders of magnitude the 25th and 75th percentiles of pig associated markers were separated by 1 4 orders of magnitude but bacteroidales markers only showed 1 2 orders of magnitude differences in 25th and 75th percentile distribution the 25th and 75th percentiles of poultry associated marker gfd were only separated by 2 orders of magnitude the concentrations of 15 host associated markers in nontarget samples were also determined the mean concentration in nontarget samples ranged from 2 48 0 48 log10 gc g for hum163 to 4 09 0 90 log10 gc g for baccow which revealed that marker concentrations in nontarget samples were nearly 1 3 order of magnitude lower compared to target samples in nontarget samples the 25th and 75th percentiles of markers were separated only 1 2 order of magnitude these results indicate relatively limited distributions for the markers in nontarget samples fig 2 to investigate the contribution of different nontarget animals to marker concentrations the distribution of markers in each nontarget host was calculated based on a corresponding standard curve figs s2 s5 3 3 classification of nontarget samples based on the distribution of false positives in nontarget samples we classified nontarget hosts into 4 groups fig 3 the concentration ranges of no cross reactivity ncr class weak cross reactivity wcr class moderate cross reactivity mcr class and strong cross reactivity scr class for each marker were showed in tables s6 s9 the results of said classification revealed that there were 47 1 nontarget animals assigned to the weak cross reactivity wcr class and 30 8 fell into the no cross reactivity ncr the moderate cross reactivity class mcr 14 5 and strong cross reactivity class scr 7 6 were much less frequent fig 3 overall this classification method indicates that most nontarget samples 77 9 were found to have little or no impact on mst assays wcr and ncr the distribution of wcr and scr were significantly different between human and nonhuman hosts paired t test p 0 05 for instance 40 5 of nontarget hosts were classified as ncr in human associated markers however of the nonhuman associated markers 52 9 of nontarget samples were classified as wcr fewer nontarget animal hosts fell into the strongly affected category in human associated markers bacteroidales and mitochondrial markers resulted in high mean concentrations in rabbit samples ranging from 5 37 1 03 log10 gc g for bachum to 3 11 0 72 log10 gc g for hum163 which were similar in target samples moreover of the ruminant associated markers bac708 and baccow the level of false positive signals from donkey were similar to those of ruminant faecal samples 4 discussion 4 1 evaluation of genetic markers beyond a regional context suitable genetic markers spanning a wide variety of geographical regions were selected from a preliminary literature review rather than conducting a blind validation study for a range of genetic markers the performance of markers typically declines dramatically when validation studies are performed beyond the regional context in which the markers were originally developed moreover it is difficult to meet the 80 requirement for both sensitivity and specificity usepa 2005 at which point the marker is considered useful for example previously published studies reported bach and bachum to be the best performing markers kildare et al 2007 reischer et al 2010 but performed poorly in our study one study also consistently found the specificity of bach and bachum to be 53 and 68 respectively even in the context of a study area that spanned sixteen countries reischer et al 2013 several possibly factors such as different diet climate animal health and lifestyle may lead to the inconsistent performance of genetic markers stewart et al 2013 shanks et al 2010b 2011 ahmed et al 2019a b in addition different dna isolation procedures and qpcr parameters e g qpcr reagent dna load are other influencing factor that cannot be ignored which may also contribute to the observed variable outcomes in different locations reischer et al 2013 boehm et al 2013 for example in the verification of bach bachum and baccow all qpcr reactions were run in a total volume of 20 μl in our study whereas the previous study performed qpcr reactions in a total volume of 25 μl kildare et al 2007 reischer et al 2010 reischer et al 2013 and the temperature settings of qpcr assays were also different among these studies this discrepancy was due to the application of different commercial reaction components for each study leading to different qpcr protocols and affecting the performance of these markers therefore we postulate that there is no single performance threshold that determines a genetic marker s applicability for mst in a wide array of regions rather the performance requirements are subject to each mst challenge and the conditions present within each particular study area 4 2 variation of source sensitivity quantitative data for host associated concentrations of markers in target samples is critical to detect their presence in aquatic environments a previous study proposes that if markers have a high qualitative sensitivity but their quantitative sensitivity i e abundance in target samples is low they are unlikely to detect faecal pollution in water samples or will otherwise tend to underestimate the level of contamination due to dilution or losses by sample processing steps ahmed et al 2019a b based on our results we propose that sensitivity may also be positively associated with the concentrations of specific markers in the target samples for example the human associated markers hum2 hum163 cpq 056 and cpq 064 exhibited poor sensitivity 59 67 and their concentrations in the target samples were also lower than the other human associated markers by 1 3 orders of magnitude a similar trend was reported by previous studies that evaluated the performance of human associated markers in singapore and australia nshimyimana et al 2017 ahmed et al 2019a b these observations suggest that a higher mean concentration of markers allow for a higher likelihood of obtaining true positive signals above the lod in target hosts thus the sensitivity of genetic markers could be used to predict the quantitative performance in target hosts when conducting preliminary screens to select promising markers based on binary data i e presence absence the population distribution of target microorganisms in the host intestines which is another factor considered in the development of genetic markers may also be linked to marker sensitivity and concentrations in target samples in the present study bacteroidales markers typically exhibited higher sensitivity and concentrations compared to other bacteria and virus markers this may be because bacteroidales are a dominant microbial population compared to most other microorganisms in mammal intestines ahmed et al 2010a the pig associated mitochondrial dna mtdna marker p nd5 also exhibited high sensitivity in our study this is consistent with several earlier studies on the abundance of mtdna markers which suggest that multiple copies of mtdna are contained in exfoliated epithelial cells he et al 2016 tambalo et al 2012 caldwell and levine 2009 thus these mtdna copies could provide strong positive signals comparable to those of the bacteroidales 16s rrna genes we also found that human associated bacteroidales markers had lower sensitivity and concentrations in target samples than nonhuman associated bacteroidales markers moreover human associated bacteroidales markers in target samples exhibited a relatively broad concentration distribution as far as we know although an investigation of the widespread distribution and stability of most bacteroidales markers has not been systematically performed to date our partial results are consistent with previous study that reported that baccow has a broader target host distribution and greater stability than bach and bachum reischer et al 2013 this can be attributed to less dominant and more variable target bacteroidales in the human gut compared to that in other mammals this was illustrated in a previous study where target bacteroidales in pig and cow faeces showed higher and more stable relative abundances than human associated bacteroidales including b fragilis b caccae b uniformis and b vulgatus hong 2010 overall the data suggests that the distribution of target microorganism populations has a significant effect on the sensitivity performance and concentrations of genetic markers a previous study reported that a highly abundant bacteriophage crassphage was discovered in human faeces dutilh et al 2014 however in our study sensitivity and concentrations of the cpq 056 and cpq 064 crassphage markers in target samples were relatively low compared to other evaluated markers one study also consistently found lower sensitivity of cpq 056 and cpq 064 both were at 46 1 in faecal samples ahmed et al 2018 this may be explained by uneven distribution of crassphage in human faeces ahmed et al 2018 previous studies have suggested that host age health or other factors may influence dispersion or aggregation of crassphage in the faeces liang et al 2016 cinek et al 2018 ahmed et al 2018 thereby affecting their detection using qpcr ahmed et al 2018 however as this experiment did not consider the age information from donors and lacked of faecal samples from patients the reason for low sensitivity of cpq 056 and cpq 064 needs to be further confirmed in future studies in addition the difference in crassphage abundance among the chinese europeans and americans may also be the reason for the low sensitivity of cpq 056 and cpq 064 in this study a previous study has reported that crassphage was less abundant in sewage from asia compared to that in united states and europe in a survey of 86 publicly available metagenomes stachler and bibby 2014 4 3 cross reactivity the occurrence of cross reactivity from nontarget samples leads to poor marker specificity to our knowledge there are no genetic markers with absolute host specificity to date the mechanisms for cross reactivity are unclear and require further investigation some genome regions of host associated genetic markers may have homology to microorganisms among different animals stachler et al 2018 cohabitation may also be an important factor explaining cross reactivity in our study frequent contact between humans and pets in urbanised areas lead to a higher proportion of false positive signals from pets in human associated markers similar observations were found in other asian areas for instance a previous study reported that rabbits contribute a large proportion of cross reactivity to human associated markers among nontarget samples in singapore due to their widespread adoption as common pets in this area nshimyimana et al 2017 moreover in rural areas free roaming poultry and pets especially dogs that are not isolated from each other might also explain the large proportion of cross reactivity from pets to the poultry associated gfd marker however as we did not collect faecal samples from pet like animals which present habitat isolation with humans and poultry such as wild rabbits the influence of cohabitation needs to be further confirmed in future studies by using animals from different habitats besides the factor of cohabitation diet and physiology may also explain cross reactivity for instance the high proportion of cross reactivity from non common animals in ruminant associated markers observed in our study might be attributed to the relatively similar diets and physiologies between these animals despite the observations mentioned above most genetic markers exhibit a limited cross reactivity with nontarget samples this may help to correctly identify sources of contamination if two or more markers are used simultaneously ahmed et al 2019a b this highlights the importance of characterising the species cross reactivity of each marker to effectively combine them for optimized target identification for example based on our results if the hum2 and cpq 056 human associated markers are used simultaneously the potential false positive signals due to the presence of hum2 in donkey may be identified when tracking the source of faecal contamination in water bodies similarly hum2 could also be used to resolve the false positive results associated with duck and dog which derive from the cpq 056 marker fig s1 4 4 low level of false positive signals the inconsistent species cross reactivity for genetic markers in different locations poses another significant challenge for the application of mst assays for instance hum2 was previously identified to cross react with chicken sheep cattle and goose in some parts of the united states layton et al 2013 shanks et al 2009 but did not amplify with these faecal samples in our study although cross reactivity was observed in pigs donkeys and rabbits fig s2 this geographical variability in cross reactivity suggests that markers may produce solely negative results for some animals if tested in a different place or region however our study revealed that most false positive signals in nontarget hosts were significantly lower than in target hosts fig 2 this observation could provide beneficial help to exclude the cross reactivity this is consistent with several earlier studies which reported that the mean concentrations of markers in target sources were generally 1 5 orders of magnitude higher than in nontarget sources reischer et al 2013 ahmed et al 2019a b such low levels of these nontarget hosts may not significantly interfere with the interpretation of results due to dilution factors and loss of gene copies through sample concentration and dna extraction in water samples ahmed et al 2019a b moreover we observed that most of the highly sensitive markers such as pig 1 bac pig 2 bac and ruminant associated markers appeared to have a greater gap between true positive and false positive signals the mean concentrations in target samples of these markers were 3 4 orders of magnitude higher than that in nontarget samples this may also provide more possibilities for detecting the potential source of faecal pollution while eliminating false positive signals it should be noted that though most false positive signals were significantly lower compared to true positive signals there will still be individual cross reactive species with a higher likelihood to exhibit false positive signals and influence the results of mst for example in our study rabbit and donkey exhibited a high degree of cross reactivity with human and ruminant associated markers respectively these false positive signals are likely to confound the detection of true positive signals therefore if false positive signals are suspected to be present in water samples the species known to be cross reacting i e those that show similar concentrations to target samples should be prioritised for higher scrutiny or otherwise excluded from the study adopting other markers instead 4 5 implication of classification for host specificity although the mean concentrations of markers were lower in nontarget samples than in target samples it would be difficult to predict whether the resulting lower false positive signals from cross reactive animals will accordingly have little impact on the mst results we proposed a novel way to address this problem based on a 25th 75th metric if the 25th percentile concentration of target samples is not overlapped by the 75th percentile concentration of nontarget samples markers usually present the clearest gap of distributions between true positive and false positive signals a small proportion of positive signals in nontarget samples may further reduce the likelihood of a false positive signal interfering with the interpretation of results our recommendations provide opportunities for policymakers and managers to select suitable markers according to specific requirements such as land use patterns for instance in highly urbanised areas there may not be significant faecal contamination input from livestock and poultry farming to justify their monitoring rather the main pollution sources in here would be humans and pets according to the classification of our results the application of the human specific sybr hf183 marker could provide high sensitivity to human originated pollution furthermore the cross reactivity from most nontarget animals could be masked due to their marker s low level abundance in nontarget hosts i e the animals which were assigned into wcr additionally pairing the hum2 and cpq 064 markers could accurately rule out the interference of cats mcr since there were no false positive signals presented in these animals moreover pig 2 bac or baccow could also be used to rule out cross reactivity from rabbits scr it is important to note that the acquisition of reliable 25th 75th metrics and mean concentrations in target and nontarget samples require a large number of validation samples from various animals there is no established guideline on how many nontarget hosts must be validated in specificity testing however the usepa mst guidelines suggest that more than 10 species of animals should be used for evaluating host specificity which would place our study well within an acceptable range however the number of nontarget host species and sample size should be increased when testing host specificity beyond a regional context due to the variability of the markers in different geographic locations also when tracking the source of faecal contamination in environmental waters the level of true positive signals may critically mask false positive signals from wcr if high concentrations of markers occur in water samples potential false positive signals from wcr may also be increased and interfere with mst results therefore markers with high concentrations in water samples should be diluted to ensure that the lower false positive signals from wcr cannot be detected this study validated the performance of a range of host associated genetic markers based on qualitative and quantitative tests for mst in china and proposed a novel classification method for comprehensive characterization of the specificity of markers our findings provide opportunities for policymakers and managers to gain access to key background information for selecting suitable markers to address the challenges of accurately tracking faecal pollution sources in a quantitative manner unfortunately in our pre screening experiments only one poultry marker gfd was found to have applicability in china and a single marker is hard to validate for accuracy of mst results the ability to develop reliable genetic markers for the specific detection of poultry faecal contaminations is still a worldwide challenge this could be due to different distributions of gut microbes in poultry compared to mammals bacteroides and its associated organisms are commonly used to develop host associated genetic markers vadde et al 2019 but a previous study revealed that bacteroides were not frequently detected in poultry gut or faeces zhu et al 2002 scupham et al 2008 thus further research needs to focus on developing reliable methods for poultry associated source tracking moreover the varying persistence of various genetic markers could also affect mst results a recent study established decay models for hf183 and cpq 056 in fresh and seawater as a function of temperature the results showed that the decay rate of hf183 was significantly faster than for cpq 056 balleste et al 2019 this difference in decay rate may affect the coupling of hf183 with cpq 056 to determine cross reactivity from nontarget hosts therefore identification of decay rates of suitable markers is equally important for mst validation 5 conclusions fifteen host associated markers presented potential suitability for mst of human pig ruminant and poultry derived faecal contamination in china overall bacteroidales markers exhibited higher sensitivity and concentrations compared to other bacterial and viral markers in target samples but their specificity was low suggesting that it might be necessary to use multiple markers when tracking the sources of faecal contamination the observed high proportion of cross reactivity from pets to human and poultry associated markers was likely due to cohabitation likewise similarities in diet and physiology may explain cross reactivity from noncommon animals horse and donkey to ruminant associated markers our novel animal cross reactivity classification method has broad implications for identifying the degree of impact of false positive results according to this method there were 77 9 nontarget samples considered to be unlikely

18013,numerous genetic markers have been developed to establish microbial source tracking mst assays in the last decade however the selection of suitable markers is challenging due to a lack of understanding of fundamental factors such as sensitivity specificity and concentration in target nontarget hosts especially in east asia in this study a total of 506 faecal samples comprised of human and 12 nonhuman hosts were collected from 28 cities across china and tested for marker performance characteristics we firstly tested 40 host associated markers based on a binary presence absence criterion here 15 markers 7 human associated 4 pig associated 3 ruminant associated and 1 poultry associated showed potential applicability in our study area the selected 15 markers were then tested using qualitative and quantitative methods to characterise their performance overall bacteroidales markers presented higher sensitivity and concentrations in target samples compared to other bacterial or viral markers but their specificity was low among nontarget samples pets accounted for 43 7 and 35 7 of cross reactivity with human associated and poultry associated markers respectively noncommon animals including horse and donkey contributed 61 3 of cross reactivity with ruminant associated markers when considering the quantitative distribution of markers their concentration in nontarget samples were 1 3 orders of magnitude lower than in target samples moreover a novel classification method was proposed to classify the nontarget hosts into four groups spanning no cross reactivity weak cross reactivity moderate cross reactivity and strong cross reactivity animal hosts there were 77 9 nontarget samples identified as no cross reactivity and weak cross reactivity hosts suggesting that these nontarget hosts produce little interference for corresponding markers our findings elucidate the performance of host associated markers around china in a qualitative and quantitative manner and reveal the interference degree of cross reactivity from nontarget animals to genetic markers which will facilitate tracking of multiple faecal pollution sources and planning timely remedial strategies in china graphical abstract image 1 keywords faecal pollution microbial source tracking genetic marker quantitative pcr china 1 introduction microbial source tracking mst is a tool used to discriminate faecal pollution from different source hosts this method presents an advantage over the traditional faecal indicator bacteria fib approach fib approach generally cannot determine the source of faecal pollution because fib are widely present in most warm blooded animal faeces reischer et al 2013 mayer et al 2018 another limitation of monitoring fib is that these bacteria can reproduce in aquatic environments alongside aquatic bacteria zhang et al 2018 which may confound pollution assessment therefore library independent mst methods which rely on the measurement of genetic markers targeting certain host associated gut microorganisms have become increasingly prominent reischer et al 2013 harwood et al 2014 feng and mclellan 2019 the presence of these genetic markers in a watershed indicates faecal pollution from specific hosts in environmental waters ahmed et al 2019a b furthermore most genetic markers were developed from obligate anaerobes and therefore degrade rapidly outside a host intestine bonjoch et al 2005 specific genetic markers such as host associated bacteroidales 16s rrna gene markers have been developed to discriminate the sources of faecal pollution from humans ahmed et al 2010a pigs mieszkin et al 2009 ruminants bernhard and field 2000 poultry green et al 2012 common pets kildare et al 2007 seagulls lu et al 2008 and other animals the performance of these markers is a key determinant in accurately identifying the source of faecal contamination moreover the suitability and accuracy of these genetic markers are susceptible to regional variability for example hf183 is known to be highly sensitive and specific to human sourced faecal pollution in belgium seurinck et al 2005 and usa boehm et al 2013 but performed poorly in singapore and india nshimyimana et al 2017 odagiri et al 2015 the bac305 marker also exhibits high specificity to ruminant faecal pollution in one particular region but not in others bernhard and field 2000 malla et al 2018 thus the search for high performance host associated marker genes in new and varied geographical regions has become a major focus of mst research in recent years the widespread applicability of genetic markers has also been limited by the often narrow regional nature of many seminal studies that evaluated the performance of faecal markers to our knowledge only one study has reported the efficacy of gene markers two human associated two ruminant associated and one bovine associated beyond a regional context collecting faecal samples from sixteen countries across six continents reischer et al 2013 this lack of data on genetic marker performance in a broad geographical context increases the difficulty of selecting mst markers for validation in new areas with certainty the performance of markers in different locations relies on repeated testing of reference faecal samples ahmed et al 2009 bernhard and field 2000 shanks et al 2010a sensitivity and specificity the most typical evaluation endpoints are usually determined by testing the presence absence of specific markers in host samples however this approach fails to quantify the abundance of said markers in individual sources the variation of marker abundance in different host species has significant implications for accurate and in depth assessment of marker performance thus characterising these variations is of great importance reischer et al 2013 to investigate the characteristics of a range of previously reported mst markers in hosts beyond a regional context china was selected as our study area china is the second largest country in asia spanning five temperature zones from cold to tropical climates until 2018 more than 1390 billion people inhabited china moreover chinese animal husbandry rapidly developed throughout the economic great leap forward period nonetheless few studies have validated mst assays across china in the present study more than 500 faecal samples were collected from 28 cities across different regions in china when considering the composition of samples faecal pollution from human common livestock and poultry are the greatest concern moreover the markers selected for our study included but were not limited to the widely well acknowledged bacteroidales genetic markers the objectives of this study were to i characterise the performance of host associated markers based on qualitative and quantitative analysis in a broad geographical area ii determine cross reactivity between hosts and the resulting level of false positive signals for each marker and iii provide a novel classification method to quantitatively assess the degree of cross reactivity between hosts 2 materials and methods 2 1 faecal sample collection from 2018 to 2019 a total of 506 faecal samples were collected from human volunteers and nonhuman hosts in 28 cities across china the sampling cities are shown in fig 1 most of the sample sites were distributed across seven major river systems in china except for those in lhasa city and urumqi city which were distributed across the continental river system of tibet and north western china respectively twenty two sampling cities were selected in south eastern china obeying the heihe tengchong geo demographic demarcation line the cities located east of said line account for the vast majority of the chinese population and consequently contribute far more faecal pollution to nearby watersheds in total 506 faecal samples were collected 117 of which were of human source 76 from pigs 102 from ruminants including cattle sheep and camels 104 from poultry including chickens ducks and geese 70 from common pet animals including dogs cats and rabbits and 37 from uncommon animals including horses and donkeys the number of faecal samples collected from each city along with their respective source species are summarized in table s1 fresh faecal samples were collected from volunteers in hospitals and from families in highly urbanised areas although some human faecal samples were collected from hospitals we applied to the doctors for faecal samples from healthy people who went to the hospital for routine physical examination rather than from patients most dog cat and rabbit faecal samples were collected from the same urban households that donated human faecal samples however a few dog cat and rabbit faeces were collected from rural households and as these animals were also living with humans they were considered as pets in this study the rest of the animal faecal material was collected from rural families livestock farms and zoos to ensure each sample came from a known source and to avoid contamination from other hosts unified sampling guidelines were defined and sent to all research partners prior to sampling in each city all faecal samples were collected using 60 ml sterile tubes collected samples were immediately placed in a sealed icebox then transported to the laboratory protected from the sunlight upon arrival to the laboratory the faecal samples were stored at 80 c until dna was extracted 2 2 dna extraction the tianamp stool dna kit tiangen beijing china was used to extract genomic dna from all faecal samples following the manufacturer recommendations for simplicity 0 25 g wet weight of each faecal sample was added into bead tubes with a lysis buffer then the samples were vigorously homogenized using a tgrinder h24 tissue homogenizer tiangen beijing china afterwards the universal dna purification kit tiangen beijing china was employed to remove polymerase chain reaction pcr inhibitors and ensure dna purity the concentration and quality of genomic dna were then measured using a nanodrop nd 1000 uv spectrophotometer maestrogen usa dna concentrations in the purified extracts were between 15 and 120 ng μl in reference to a previous study reischer et al 2013 purified dna extracts with concentrations 30 ng μl were diluted tenfold to ensure that all the purified dna extract concentrations ranged from 3 to 30 ng μl for downstream analyses and the concentrations of most dna templates were within 10 ng μl fig s1 2 3 qpcr assays and preliminary experiments all qpcr reactions were performed in triplicate on a roche lightcycler 480 ii system roche diagnostics ltd rotkreuz switzerland because we used different commercial reaction components e g polymerases than those reported in original publications all assays were run according to the recommended reaction mixtures and procedure of the used commercial kit tiangen china probe based host associated gene marker assays were performed using 20 μl qpcr mixtures containing 10 μl of 2 superreal probe premix tiangen china and 2 μl of dna template the quantities of probe and primer added were determined by their intended final concentration in the mixtures for sybr based marker assays 20 μl qpcr mixtures were prepared incorporating 10 μl 2 talent qpcr premix tiangen china 2 μl of dna template and 10 μm of each primer the protocol for probe based qpcr assays was executed according to the superreal probe premix manufacturer s instructions 95 c for 15 min followed by 40 cycles of 95 c for 3 s and 60 c for 30 s the sybr based qpcr protocol consisted of a step at 95 c for 30 min followed by 40 cycles of 95 c for 5 s and 60 c for 10 s as described in previous studies the general bacteroidetes marker allbac assay was performed to confirm the amplification of dna templates and the absence of pcr inhibition reischer et al 2013 mayer et al 2018 the detail of allbac was shown in table s2 to identify suitable host associated markers for an in depth analysis we adopted the validation method of a previous study to perform pre screening experiments targeting 40 markers table s2 fan et al 2017 these genetic markers 21 human associated 8 pig associated 7 ruminant associated and 4 poultry associated included but were not limited to the often used bacteroidales genetic markers the host associated marker selection criteria in this study were i that they targeted human pig ruminant and poultry hosts and ii that they had precedence of good performance either in the region where they were developed or in other locations the performance of the 40 markers were shown in table s3 markers with sensitivity and specificity greater than 50 were selected for further analysis among these 40 markers only fifteen markers met this criterion including 7 human associated 4 pig associated 3 ruminant associated and 1 poultry associated table 1 after pre screening experiments we performed in depth assessment for these fifteen markers quantitative analysis of these 15 markers was based on plasmid standard dilutions plasmid dna for different hosts was prepared with the respective target pcr product and primers the pgem t easy vector bgi china was used for the crassphage marker all other assays were performed with the pmd 19 t vector standard curves for all assays were generated using seven 10 fold serial dilutions of plasmid dna i e 100 106 gene copies gc the resulting qpcr efficiencies were between 90 and 110 the limits of detection lods for individual markers were calculated at 99 confidence intervals as previously described nshimyimana et al 2014 every qpcr incorporated dna template triplicates and non template controls table s4 to ensure reproducibility between different plates two standards from 102 and 103 copies μl diluted positive controls plasmid dna of each marker were tested in different plates as described in a previous study nshimyimana et al 2017 the average coefficient of variability cv was 3 87 0 87 for the 103 copies μl standard and 3 75 0 80 for the 102 copies μl standard table s5 2 4 data analysis sensitivity r and specificity s were determined according to the following equations kildare et al 2007 odagiri et al 2015 1 r tp tp fn 2 s tn tn fp tp represents positive results for target reference samples and fn represents negative results for target reference samples conversely tn indicates negative results for nontarget reference samples and fp represents positive results for nontarget reference samples in preliminary experiments the mean reaction with 31 0 cq is considered as a positive result in the 15 selected markers the qualitative performance was strictly re assessed based on the lower limit of detection lod boehm et al 2013 layton et al 2013 the concentrations of the 15 markers in target and nontarget samples were evaluated with standard curves we employed a 25th 75th metric to classify nontarget animal marker specificity and abundance into 4 groups the 25th 75th metric was determined by subtracting the 75th percentile concentration in the nontarget hosts from the 25th percentile concentration in the target hosts for each marker i e 25th 75th metric 25th percentiletarget 75th percentilenontarget reischer et al 2013 the four aforementioned groups were 1 no cross reactivity ncr the marker did not produce any positive signals in the nontarget animal 2 weak cross reactivity wcr the 25th 75th metric rendered a positive value 3 moderate cross reactivity mcr the 25th 75th metric rendered a negative value and 4 strong cross reactivity scr the disparity between the mean concentrations of target and nontarget samples was below 1 order of magnitude qpcr data were converted into a log10 format and statistical significance was determined via the t test or one way anova all data analysis was performed using microsoft excel 2010 spss 22 and the r statistical computing software 3 results to understand the potential challenges of applying markers in a wide range of geographical regions the performance of 15 promising pre selected markers was mainly discussed in the subsequent analysis of this study interestingly the results of qualitative analysis for cow specific bacteroidales bac708 and baccow markers were not only detected in cattle samples but were also highly prevalent in sheep and camel samples therefore baccow and bobac should be more generally considered ruminant associated markers rather than cow specific markers 3 1 qualitative analysis the sensitivities of all the markers tested ranged from 61 to 100 table 2 among these human associated markers had the most variable sensitivity 61 98 followed by pig associated markers 68 100 in contrast ruminant associated marker sensitivity was in the 96 100 range table 2 in human associated markers bacteroidales markers including bach bachum and sybr hf183 were the most prevalent genetic markers exhibiting host sensitivity values of 98 82 and 74 respectively mitochondrial dna markers hum2 hum 163 and crassphage markers cpq 056 cpq 064 exhibited relatively low sensitivity 59 67 moreover pig associated bacteroidales markers pig 1 bac pig 2 bac and mitochondrial marker p nd5 exhibited significantly higher sensitivity 95 100 compared to lactobacillus amylovorus markers 68 all ruminant associated markers targeted bacteroidales and showed the highest prevalence in target samples compared to other host associated markers 96 unfortunately only one poultry associated marker gfd was selected for applicability in our study from preliminary screens and the sensitivity of this marker 68 was low compared to other bacteroidales markers the specificity of the evaluated markers ranged from 50 to 91 no marker exhibited absolute host specificity but most host associated markers presented limited cross reactivity to nontarget samples except for pig 1 bac rum 2 bac and bac708 human associated markers presented the highest number of false positives occurring with pets i e 43 7 of the pet samples tested positive for seven human associated markers similarly the pets also contributed many false positive signals to the poultry associated marker gfd i e 35 7 of pet samples tested positive for the gfd marker similarly ruminant associated markers yielded the highest numbers of non common animal horse and donkey false positives with 61 3 of non common animal samples testing positive for ruminant associated markers in human associated markers bacteroidales markers exhibited lower specificity compared to mitochondrial dna markers and crassphage markers this trend was especially true for bach and bachum which exhibited host specificity values of 51 and 55 respectively among the pig associated markers the specificity value of both pig 2 bac and p nd5 were 0 90 but pig 1 bac showed relatively lower specificity 68 compared to other pig associated markers ruminant associated markers all presented low specificity 80 especially bac708 which exhibited a specificity of barely 50 in contrast gfd showed the highest specificity 91 compared to other host associated markers overall there was an apparent trade off between sensitivity and specificity in mst markers whereby an improvement in one parameter usually translated to a decrease in the other 3 2 quantitative analysis marker abundance in faecal material was characterised per gram of wet faeces as discussed in previous studies ahmed et al 2019a b nshimyimana et al 2017 layton et al 2013 the abundance of markers in target and nontarget samples were assessed based on the 25th 75th percentiles and mean concentrations mean concentrations of human associated markers in target samples ranged from 3 57 0 77 log10 gc g to 5 27 1 25 log10 gc g while the range in pig associated markers in target samples ranged from 4 99 1 79 log10 gc g to 6 58 1 59 log10 gc g ruminant associated markers had the highest concentrations ranging from 6 19 1 26 log10 gc g to 7 15 0 89 log10 gc g the poultry associated marker gfd exhibited relatively low concentrations 4 09 0 96 log10 gc g in target samples bacteroidales markers generally presented significantly higher concentrations in target samples compared to most of the other markers paired t test p 0 05 meanwhile mitochondrial marker p nd5 also exhibited high concentrations and showed no statistically significant differences in abundance with pig 1 bac paired t test p 0 05 moreover the concentrations of tested markers in target samples presented much broader distributions 25th and 75th percentiles of marker concentrations were separated by 1 4 orders of magnitude fig 2 in human associated markers 25th and 75th percentiles of bacteroidales markers were separated by 3 4 orders of magnitude which evidences a relatively broad distribution compared to mitochondrial dna and crassphage markers in contrast all ruminant associated markers presented a relatively narrow gap of 25th and 75th percentile distribution which were separated by 1 3 orders of magnitude the 25th and 75th percentiles of pig associated markers were separated by 1 4 orders of magnitude but bacteroidales markers only showed 1 2 orders of magnitude differences in 25th and 75th percentile distribution the 25th and 75th percentiles of poultry associated marker gfd were only separated by 2 orders of magnitude the concentrations of 15 host associated markers in nontarget samples were also determined the mean concentration in nontarget samples ranged from 2 48 0 48 log10 gc g for hum163 to 4 09 0 90 log10 gc g for baccow which revealed that marker concentrations in nontarget samples were nearly 1 3 order of magnitude lower compared to target samples in nontarget samples the 25th and 75th percentiles of markers were separated only 1 2 order of magnitude these results indicate relatively limited distributions for the markers in nontarget samples fig 2 to investigate the contribution of different nontarget animals to marker concentrations the distribution of markers in each nontarget host was calculated based on a corresponding standard curve figs s2 s5 3 3 classification of nontarget samples based on the distribution of false positives in nontarget samples we classified nontarget hosts into 4 groups fig 3 the concentration ranges of no cross reactivity ncr class weak cross reactivity wcr class moderate cross reactivity mcr class and strong cross reactivity scr class for each marker were showed in tables s6 s9 the results of said classification revealed that there were 47 1 nontarget animals assigned to the weak cross reactivity wcr class and 30 8 fell into the no cross reactivity ncr the moderate cross reactivity class mcr 14 5 and strong cross reactivity class scr 7 6 were much less frequent fig 3 overall this classification method indicates that most nontarget samples 77 9 were found to have little or no impact on mst assays wcr and ncr the distribution of wcr and scr were significantly different between human and nonhuman hosts paired t test p 0 05 for instance 40 5 of nontarget hosts were classified as ncr in human associated markers however of the nonhuman associated markers 52 9 of nontarget samples were classified as wcr fewer nontarget animal hosts fell into the strongly affected category in human associated markers bacteroidales and mitochondrial markers resulted in high mean concentrations in rabbit samples ranging from 5 37 1 03 log10 gc g for bachum to 3 11 0 72 log10 gc g for hum163 which were similar in target samples moreover of the ruminant associated markers bac708 and baccow the level of false positive signals from donkey were similar to those of ruminant faecal samples 4 discussion 4 1 evaluation of genetic markers beyond a regional context suitable genetic markers spanning a wide variety of geographical regions were selected from a preliminary literature review rather than conducting a blind validation study for a range of genetic markers the performance of markers typically declines dramatically when validation studies are performed beyond the regional context in which the markers were originally developed moreover it is difficult to meet the 80 requirement for both sensitivity and specificity usepa 2005 at which point the marker is considered useful for example previously published studies reported bach and bachum to be the best performing markers kildare et al 2007 reischer et al 2010 but performed poorly in our study one study also consistently found the specificity of bach and bachum to be 53 and 68 respectively even in the context of a study area that spanned sixteen countries reischer et al 2013 several possibly factors such as different diet climate animal health and lifestyle may lead to the inconsistent performance of genetic markers stewart et al 2013 shanks et al 2010b 2011 ahmed et al 2019a b in addition different dna isolation procedures and qpcr parameters e g qpcr reagent dna load are other influencing factor that cannot be ignored which may also contribute to the observed variable outcomes in different locations reischer et al 2013 boehm et al 2013 for example in the verification of bach bachum and baccow all qpcr reactions were run in a total volume of 20 μl in our study whereas the previous study performed qpcr reactions in a total volume of 25 μl kildare et al 2007 reischer et al 2010 reischer et al 2013 and the temperature settings of qpcr assays were also different among these studies this discrepancy was due to the application of different commercial reaction components for each study leading to different qpcr protocols and affecting the performance of these markers therefore we postulate that there is no single performance threshold that determines a genetic marker s applicability for mst in a wide array of regions rather the performance requirements are subject to each mst challenge and the conditions present within each particular study area 4 2 variation of source sensitivity quantitative data for host associated concentrations of markers in target samples is critical to detect their presence in aquatic environments a previous study proposes that if markers have a high qualitative sensitivity but their quantitative sensitivity i e abundance in target samples is low they are unlikely to detect faecal pollution in water samples or will otherwise tend to underestimate the level of contamination due to dilution or losses by sample processing steps ahmed et al 2019a b based on our results we propose that sensitivity may also be positively associated with the concentrations of specific markers in the target samples for example the human associated markers hum2 hum163 cpq 056 and cpq 064 exhibited poor sensitivity 59 67 and their concentrations in the target samples were also lower than the other human associated markers by 1 3 orders of magnitude a similar trend was reported by previous studies that evaluated the performance of human associated markers in singapore and australia nshimyimana et al 2017 ahmed et al 2019a b these observations suggest that a higher mean concentration of markers allow for a higher likelihood of obtaining true positive signals above the lod in target hosts thus the sensitivity of genetic markers could be used to predict the quantitative performance in target hosts when conducting preliminary screens to select promising markers based on binary data i e presence absence the population distribution of target microorganisms in the host intestines which is another factor considered in the development of genetic markers may also be linked to marker sensitivity and concentrations in target samples in the present study bacteroidales markers typically exhibited higher sensitivity and concentrations compared to other bacteria and virus markers this may be because bacteroidales are a dominant microbial population compared to most other microorganisms in mammal intestines ahmed et al 2010a the pig associated mitochondrial dna mtdna marker p nd5 also exhibited high sensitivity in our study this is consistent with several earlier studies on the abundance of mtdna markers which suggest that multiple copies of mtdna are contained in exfoliated epithelial cells he et al 2016 tambalo et al 2012 caldwell and levine 2009 thus these mtdna copies could provide strong positive signals comparable to those of the bacteroidales 16s rrna genes we also found that human associated bacteroidales markers had lower sensitivity and concentrations in target samples than nonhuman associated bacteroidales markers moreover human associated bacteroidales markers in target samples exhibited a relatively broad concentration distribution as far as we know although an investigation of the widespread distribution and stability of most bacteroidales markers has not been systematically performed to date our partial results are consistent with previous study that reported that baccow has a broader target host distribution and greater stability than bach and bachum reischer et al 2013 this can be attributed to less dominant and more variable target bacteroidales in the human gut compared to that in other mammals this was illustrated in a previous study where target bacteroidales in pig and cow faeces showed higher and more stable relative abundances than human associated bacteroidales including b fragilis b caccae b uniformis and b vulgatus hong 2010 overall the data suggests that the distribution of target microorganism populations has a significant effect on the sensitivity performance and concentrations of genetic markers a previous study reported that a highly abundant bacteriophage crassphage was discovered in human faeces dutilh et al 2014 however in our study sensitivity and concentrations of the cpq 056 and cpq 064 crassphage markers in target samples were relatively low compared to other evaluated markers one study also consistently found lower sensitivity of cpq 056 and cpq 064 both were at 46 1 in faecal samples ahmed et al 2018 this may be explained by uneven distribution of crassphage in human faeces ahmed et al 2018 previous studies have suggested that host age health or other factors may influence dispersion or aggregation of crassphage in the faeces liang et al 2016 cinek et al 2018 ahmed et al 2018 thereby affecting their detection using qpcr ahmed et al 2018 however as this experiment did not consider the age information from donors and lacked of faecal samples from patients the reason for low sensitivity of cpq 056 and cpq 064 needs to be further confirmed in future studies in addition the difference in crassphage abundance among the chinese europeans and americans may also be the reason for the low sensitivity of cpq 056 and cpq 064 in this study a previous study has reported that crassphage was less abundant in sewage from asia compared to that in united states and europe in a survey of 86 publicly available metagenomes stachler and bibby 2014 4 3 cross reactivity the occurrence of cross reactivity from nontarget samples leads to poor marker specificity to our knowledge there are no genetic markers with absolute host specificity to date the mechanisms for cross reactivity are unclear and require further investigation some genome regions of host associated genetic markers may have homology to microorganisms among different animals stachler et al 2018 cohabitation may also be an important factor explaining cross reactivity in our study frequent contact between humans and pets in urbanised areas lead to a higher proportion of false positive signals from pets in human associated markers similar observations were found in other asian areas for instance a previous study reported that rabbits contribute a large proportion of cross reactivity to human associated markers among nontarget samples in singapore due to their widespread adoption as common pets in this area nshimyimana et al 2017 moreover in rural areas free roaming poultry and pets especially dogs that are not isolated from each other might also explain the large proportion of cross reactivity from pets to the poultry associated gfd marker however as we did not collect faecal samples from pet like animals which present habitat isolation with humans and poultry such as wild rabbits the influence of cohabitation needs to be further confirmed in future studies by using animals from different habitats besides the factor of cohabitation diet and physiology may also explain cross reactivity for instance the high proportion of cross reactivity from non common animals in ruminant associated markers observed in our study might be attributed to the relatively similar diets and physiologies between these animals despite the observations mentioned above most genetic markers exhibit a limited cross reactivity with nontarget samples this may help to correctly identify sources of contamination if two or more markers are used simultaneously ahmed et al 2019a b this highlights the importance of characterising the species cross reactivity of each marker to effectively combine them for optimized target identification for example based on our results if the hum2 and cpq 056 human associated markers are used simultaneously the potential false positive signals due to the presence of hum2 in donkey may be identified when tracking the source of faecal contamination in water bodies similarly hum2 could also be used to resolve the false positive results associated with duck and dog which derive from the cpq 056 marker fig s1 4 4 low level of false positive signals the inconsistent species cross reactivity for genetic markers in different locations poses another significant challenge for the application of mst assays for instance hum2 was previously identified to cross react with chicken sheep cattle and goose in some parts of the united states layton et al 2013 shanks et al 2009 but did not amplify with these faecal samples in our study although cross reactivity was observed in pigs donkeys and rabbits fig s2 this geographical variability in cross reactivity suggests that markers may produce solely negative results for some animals if tested in a different place or region however our study revealed that most false positive signals in nontarget hosts were significantly lower than in target hosts fig 2 this observation could provide beneficial help to exclude the cross reactivity this is consistent with several earlier studies which reported that the mean concentrations of markers in target sources were generally 1 5 orders of magnitude higher than in nontarget sources reischer et al 2013 ahmed et al 2019a b such low levels of these nontarget hosts may not significantly interfere with the interpretation of results due to dilution factors and loss of gene copies through sample concentration and dna extraction in water samples ahmed et al 2019a b moreover we observed that most of the highly sensitive markers such as pig 1 bac pig 2 bac and ruminant associated markers appeared to have a greater gap between true positive and false positive signals the mean concentrations in target samples of these markers were 3 4 orders of magnitude higher than that in nontarget samples this may also provide more possibilities for detecting the potential source of faecal pollution while eliminating false positive signals it should be noted that though most false positive signals were significantly lower compared to true positive signals there will still be individual cross reactive species with a higher likelihood to exhibit false positive signals and influence the results of mst for example in our study rabbit and donkey exhibited a high degree of cross reactivity with human and ruminant associated markers respectively these false positive signals are likely to confound the detection of true positive signals therefore if false positive signals are suspected to be present in water samples the species known to be cross reacting i e those that show similar concentrations to target samples should be prioritised for higher scrutiny or otherwise excluded from the study adopting other markers instead 4 5 implication of classification for host specificity although the mean concentrations of markers were lower in nontarget samples than in target samples it would be difficult to predict whether the resulting lower false positive signals from cross reactive animals will accordingly have little impact on the mst results we proposed a novel way to address this problem based on a 25th 75th metric if the 25th percentile concentration of target samples is not overlapped by the 75th percentile concentration of nontarget samples markers usually present the clearest gap of distributions between true positive and false positive signals a small proportion of positive signals in nontarget samples may further reduce the likelihood of a false positive signal interfering with the interpretation of results our recommendations provide opportunities for policymakers and managers to select suitable markers according to specific requirements such as land use patterns for instance in highly urbanised areas there may not be significant faecal contamination input from livestock and poultry farming to justify their monitoring rather the main pollution sources in here would be humans and pets according to the classification of our results the application of the human specific sybr hf183 marker could provide high sensitivity to human originated pollution furthermore the cross reactivity from most nontarget animals could be masked due to their marker s low level abundance in nontarget hosts i e the animals which were assigned into wcr additionally pairing the hum2 and cpq 064 markers could accurately rule out the interference of cats mcr since there were no false positive signals presented in these animals moreover pig 2 bac or baccow could also be used to rule out cross reactivity from rabbits scr it is important to note that the acquisition of reliable 25th 75th metrics and mean concentrations in target and nontarget samples require a large number of validation samples from various animals there is no established guideline on how many nontarget hosts must be validated in specificity testing however the usepa mst guidelines suggest that more than 10 species of animals should be used for evaluating host specificity which would place our study well within an acceptable range however the number of nontarget host species and sample size should be increased when testing host specificity beyond a regional context due to the variability of the markers in different geographic locations also when tracking the source of faecal contamination in environmental waters the level of true positive signals may critically mask false positive signals from wcr if high concentrations of markers occur in water samples potential false positive signals from wcr may also be increased and interfere with mst results therefore markers with high concentrations in water samples should be diluted to ensure that the lower false positive signals from wcr cannot be detected this study validated the performance of a range of host associated genetic markers based on qualitative and quantitative tests for mst in china and proposed a novel classification method for comprehensive characterization of the specificity of markers our findings provide opportunities for policymakers and managers to gain access to key background information for selecting suitable markers to address the challenges of accurately tracking faecal pollution sources in a quantitative manner unfortunately in our pre screening experiments only one poultry marker gfd was found to have applicability in china and a single marker is hard to validate for accuracy of mst results the ability to develop reliable genetic markers for the specific detection of poultry faecal contaminations is still a worldwide challenge this could be due to different distributions of gut microbes in poultry compared to mammals bacteroides and its associated organisms are commonly used to develop host associated genetic markers vadde et al 2019 but a previous study revealed that bacteroides were not frequently detected in poultry gut or faeces zhu et al 2002 scupham et al 2008 thus further research needs to focus on developing reliable methods for poultry associated source tracking moreover the varying persistence of various genetic markers could also affect mst results a recent study established decay models for hf183 and cpq 056 in fresh and seawater as a function of temperature the results showed that the decay rate of hf183 was significantly faster than for cpq 056 balleste et al 2019 this difference in decay rate may affect the coupling of hf183 with cpq 056 to determine cross reactivity from nontarget hosts therefore identification of decay rates of suitable markers is equally important for mst validation 5 conclusions fifteen host associated markers presented potential suitability for mst of human pig ruminant and poultry derived faecal contamination in china overall bacteroidales markers exhibited higher sensitivity and concentrations compared to other bacterial and viral markers in target samples but their specificity was low suggesting that it might be necessary to use multiple markers when tracking the sources of faecal contamination the observed high proportion of cross reactivity from pets to human and poultry associated markers was likely due to cohabitation likewise similarities in diet and physiology may explain cross reactivity from noncommon animals horse and donkey to ruminant associated markers our novel animal cross reactivity classification method has broad implications for identifying the degree of impact of false positive results according to this method there were 77 9 nontarget samples considered to be unlikely mismatched to the selected 15 markers due to their absence or low concentrations in nontarget samples declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

18014,photocatalysis provides a green strategy to produce the clean energy of h2 however the realization of efficient h2 production is usually accomplished by the consumption of electron donors which are costly energy carriers themselves here we attempted to utilize the naturally abundant humic acid ha a representative natural organic matter nom as the source of electron donor in a cascading oxic anoxic photocatalytic system results showed that degradation of ha and remarkable h2 yield 1660 9 μmol g 1 h 1 at optimal condition were obtained successively whereas the anoxic photocatalytic treatment of pristine ha did not improve h2 yield but substantially eliminated the h2 production and ha degradation efficiency these phenomena suggested the preoxidation process played a vital role in counteracting the detrimental effect of ha on photocatalytic h2 production electrochemical measurement indicated that the preoxidized ha harbored more redox active moieties than the untreated ha and thus leading to a higher photo induced charge carrier separation efficiency a variety of advanced spectroscopic analyses revealed that the photocatalytic oxic pre treatment resulted in breakdown of chemically inert electron mediating and chromophoric aromatic macrostructure of ha to form smaller sized oxygenated organic intermediates these intermediates were more nucleophilic than the pristine ha and acted as sacrificial reagent in the subsequent anoxic process for boosting h2 production this study showcases an energy recovering water remediation process and paves the way for the design of novel photocatalytic technologies for environmental application graphical abstract image 1 keywords natural organic matter photocatalysis hydrogen production photocatalytic oxic anoxic process 1 introduction hydrogen h2 is being intensively investigated as an environmentally benign energy carrier for industry and daily life dunn 2002 to date however h2 is mainly derived from gas steam reforming from fossil fuels and natural gas at high temperature which in turn consume huge energy and emit large amount of greenhouse gas of co2 making the effective implementation of h2 economically and environmentally unsustainable hosseini and wahid 2016 thus cost effective and green h2 production methods are being actively sought to mitigate the environmental and energy issues an appealing method is solar h2 production from water splitting driven by photocatalysis ni et al 2007 the principles of photocatalytic water splitting are well documented and typically employs semiconductors e g tio2 as the photocatalyst upon irradiation the photogenerated electrons of the photocatalysts migrate to the conduction band or a cocatalyst e g pt which then reduce protons h or water molecules to generate h2 ni et al 2007 puga 2016 however the process employing pure water is usually rather inefficient or is not even operative for application schneider and bahnemann 2013 to improve the h2 yield numerous researches have been carried out in the presence of an excess of electron donors e g alcohols namely the sacrificial reagents as photogenerated holes are irreversibly scavenged by these sacrificial molecules and electron hole recombination can be greatly reduced resulting in higher conversion efficiency furthermore as o2 is not produced the thermodynamically favored backward reaction of h2 with o2 to form h2o is suppressed puga 2016 various organic substances such as alcohols fu et al 2011 organic acids zielinska et al 2008 and hydrocarbons hashimoto et al 1984 have been tested as sacrificial donors with different photocatalysts for h2 production in recent years however it is worth noting that these commonly used sacrificial reagents are valuable energy carriers themselves and obtained costly which hinders the application of such photocatalytic system in industry to address this challenge efforts ought to be devoted to replacing the expensive electron donors with naturally abundant materials or waste that must be disposed of puga 2016 indeed the effectiveness of photocatalysis has been intensively studied in water remediation and found to be successful in achieving degradation of numerous organic compounds in water tanaka et al 2000 gaya and abdullah 2008 ahmed et al 2011 it is therefore very attractive to develop photocatalytic technologies that combine water treatment with h2 production this approach is economically and environmentally sensible since h2 can be recovered as a fuel to reduce the total costs associated with water treatment the key for establishing such single step system lies in the synergy between the photocatalysts and the pollutants in which the electrons reduce the water protons and the hole or hole derived ros oxidize the pollutants selectively analogous to the situation when using standard sacrificial reagent kim et al 2012 however it should be noted that the characteristics of organic contaminants are very different from those of standard sacrificial reagents schneider and bahnemann 2013 for example typical sacrificial reagents e g alcohol aldehydes and carboxylic acids are small molecules with a tendency to donate electron whereas organic contaminants e g dyes hormones and pesticides are commonly both chemically inert and biologically recalcitrant baban et al 2010 ghattas et al 2017 therefore organic contaminants are commonly found to be inefficiently oxidized by photocatalysis in the absence of o2 anoxic condition kim and choi 2010 most reported values for the efficiencies of photocatalytic pollutant degradation and simultaneous h2 production were relatively low and even this technique was reported to be infeasible when using tio2 as the photocatalyst puga 2016 romao et al 2016 a few literature has reported that the realization of water remediation with simultaneous h2 production can be attained by surface modification of tio2 hybrid photocatalysts or using novel photocatalysts such as metal organic framework kim et al 2012 jiang et al 2018 kampouri et al 2018 despite their dual function in such single step system it is not known yet the key factors that determine their success in such system and how these photocatalysts distinguish from the other photocatalysts that did not perform well in such system moreover the fabrication of the dual function photocatalysts is generally a challenging process therefore it would be of great merit to develop new strategies to achieve energy recovering water treatment process that is applicable to universal photocatalysts such as tio2 which can be commercially available in large scale previously a research conducted by kim and choi 2010 has highlighted the possible benefits of combining the photocatalytic anoxic and oxic treatment in sequence which resembles the biological wastewater treatment process that comprised of cascading anaerobic and aerobic phases they demonstrated that the photocatalytic energy recovering water treatment process can be accomplished in two steps 1 anoxic degradation organic pollution in which h2 is produced and 2 the post phase of oxic degradation where the organic intermediates were mineralized as a matter of fact sequential adaptation of anoxic and oxic treatment is a commonly applied strategy in biological treatment of municipal wastewater treatment plants to achieve a combination of goals including organic degradation nitrification denitrification as well as energy production baeza et al 2004 zhao et al 2009 despite the advantage of simultaneous production of h2 and degradation of organic pollutants this photocatalytic anoxic oxic approach may not be applicable to photocatalysts that cannot achieve simultaneous pollutant degradation and h2 production in the first phase furthermore the organic intermediates were wasted without profitable output in the post phase of oxic degradation a recent study by our research group indicated that the organic intermediates other than the pristine organic pollutant could contribute to enhanced h2 production chu et al 2017 drawing inspiration from these studies it would be of great interest to switch the sequential treatment process to an alignment of photocatalytic oxic anoxic treatment in which the organic intermediates from the oxic treatment can be used as sacrificial reagent in the post anoxic phase for h2 production in addition organic pollutants are often encountered as multicomponent mixtures dao et al 2010 for example the natural organic matter nom are complex organic macromolecules that ubiquitously present in various environment including soils waters sediments matilainen et al 2011 nom is objectionable to water supplier and water end users because nom is resistant to biological oxidation and present a hazard as a precursor of potential harmful disinfection byproduct dbp e g trihalomethanes formed by water chlorination kitis et al 2001 in a typical water treatment plant the removal of nom is achieved in the coagulation process where the nom is transferred from the liquid to the solid phase as flocs using coagulants however it is often difficult to achieve reliable and effective coagulation particularly for water conditions that are highly variable sharp et al 2006 moreover there is always a significant fraction of nom recalcitrant to removal by coagulation processes fabris et al 2004 previous studies have proven that photocatalysis can be used as an effective method to degrade nom because of its potential to use sunlight to drive the process using a reusable catalyst bekbölet 1996 valencia et al 2013 besides nom is naturally abundant and plays a significant role in the global carbon cycle as one of the largest reservoirs of reduced carbon on the earth surface kujawinski et al 2009 for example the carbon in soil nom is estimated from 700 1015 to 3000 1015 g c which is in magnitude comparable to the atmospheric carbon aiken 1995 therefore nom is attractive as an easily available electron source for photocatalytic h2 production because of its high carbon content low cost and large availability previously klauson et al 2014 has used humic acid ha a representative nom as the substrate for photocatalytic h2 production under simulated solar light however the ha they used is a pure chemical with a specific characteristic structure which cannot reflect the complex nature of the multicomponent ha despite the wide presence of ha in the environment no literature has employed naturally derived and multicomponent ha as the substrate for photocatalytic h2 production in this work we explore an innovative cascading oxic anoxic photocatalytic system for the oxic degradation of ha and the successive anoxic h2 production using the intermediates from the post oxic phases model photocatalyst tio2 was used as the catalyst under uva led irradiation results show that the oxic pretreatment could counteract the inhibitory effect of ha on photocatalytic h2 production the corresponding mechanism was systematically probed by electrochemical measurements and a variety of advanced spectroscopic analyses this study may provide useful information to guide the future design and optimization of photocatalytic energy recovering water treatment processes and is intended to encourage more thinking and research on photocatalytic oxic and anoxic treatment technologies 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents and solution preparation all solutions were prepared using reagent grade chemicals and milli q water 18 2 mω

anoxic photocatalytic treatment process ha were firstly treated in the oxic phase and then transfer to the successive anoxic treatment the preoxidized ha samples were filtered through a 0 45 μm nitrocellulose membrane to remove the tio2 nanoparticles since tio2 pt was used as photocatalysts in the anoxic phase in addition the time profiles of h2 production in the presence or absence of preoxidized ha 6h were measured through repeated cycles of photocatalytic anoxic treatment the suspension was purged with nitrogen prior to between each cycle to remove accumulated h2 2 3 bulk

some ha were absorbed by tio2 when irradiation started uv254 decreased linearly along with oxic photocatalytic reaction time and reached a minimum of 1 3 m 1 after 8 h which is much lower than that of the untreated ha 86 8 m 1 this implied that the aromatic structure can be substantially degraded under oxic photocatalytic pretreatment conversely the toc followed a gradual decrease trend during the initial 6 h from 14 27 to 12 14 mg c l and then underwent a relatively fast drop to 9 07 mg c l at 8 h compared with the removal degree of uv254 99 the toc had a significantly lower removal degree 36 at 8 h these results implied that the transformation of organic pollutants mainly occurred during the initial of oxic photocatalytic process and the mineralization would need a relatively longer reaction time as compared with their degradation breakdown of pristine structure interestingly the spectrum of ha fig s1 was found to be shifted to the lower wavelength and a new shoulder peak ca 250 nm could be detected especially after 6 h oxic treatment this could be related to the formation of formation of new intermediate products in addition the photocatalytic degradation of ha under anoxic environment was also conducted for comparison fig s2 as shown in fig s3 the suva254 value of the untreated ha 6 2 l mg 1 m 1 underwent a significant decline to 0 4 l mg 1 m 1 an indication of nom of low aromaticity suva 2 mg 1 m 1 after 6 h photocatalytic oxic treatment after 8 h the suva254 further decreased to 0 1 mg 1 m 1 this value is much lower than the reported suva254 values 1 5 and 1 2 mg 1 m 1 of the finished water in two drinking water treatment trains that applied coagulation and filtration to remove nom baghoth et al 2011 this finding suggested the photocatalytic oxic treatment can significantly reduce the aromatic character of the ha in the treated water it was found that no obvious decrease in both uv254 and toc occurred in the de aerated suspension suggesting that oxygen is required for efficient degradation of ha this conclusion was further corroborated by the results of scavenger studies fig s4 which indicated that the o2 were predominantly involved in the degradation of ha considering the relatively low reactivity of o2 the contributing role of o2 in the degradation of ha could be attributed to the generation of highly oxidative oh derived from it long et al 2017 in short these results indicated that the oxic photocatalytic pretreatment was effective in the decomposition of ha but not the mineralization of ha this is of particular importance since the decomposed ha is assumed to serve as electron donors in the subsequent h2 production next the cascading photocatalytic h2 production experiments were conducted in the presence of the various pre oxidized ha under anoxic environment fig 2 the h2 production experiments using pure water and untreated ha were also carried out as references firstly the h2 evolution profiles for all the samples follow a linear trend as a function of irradiation time secondly the photocatalytic production of h2 in the absence of organic substrates i e in pure water was observed with a h2 generation rate of 116 0 μmol g 1 h 1 whereas no h2 was detected in the presence of untreated ha this indicated that the untreated ha could not serve as sacrificial reagent for boosting photocatalytic h2 production but substantially impeding the generation of h2 this could be ascribed to the fact that the untreated ha would compete with the photocatalysts for the uva light peak at 365 nm source fig s5 as the untreated ha t 0 h had strong absorbance in the region of 200 400 nm fig s1 as such the light attenuation by the untreated ha could be a reason for the inhibited h2 production thirdly in comparison with the control case without any organic substrate the photocatalytic h2 production was enhanced to different extent in the presence of preoxidized substrates and the h2 generation rates improved with increased preoxidation time and peaked at 1660 9 μmol g 1 h 1 during the initial 6 h however a marked decayed of h2 yield with the preoxidation time prolonged to 8 h 452 8 μmol g 1 h 1 this decrease of the h2 yield could be ascribed to decrease of preoxidized organic intermediates contents as reflected by the corresponding decrease in toc at 8 h fig 1 hence the preoxidation time of 6 h is the optimal condition for the subsequent h2 production in which the intermediates can be further mineralized as revealed by the toc evolution under anoxic condition fig s6 this h2 production profile highlighted the significance of preoxidation process and the preoxidized organic intermediates in enhancing the photocatalytic h2 production from ha to appreciate the significance of the photocatalytic h2 production from ha in the cascading oxic anoxic process photocatalytic h2 production experiments using other substrates were carried out table 1 for comparison standard aqueous solutions of methanol glucose phenol and edta were prepared at toc concentrations equivalent to that of the preoxidized ha for 6 h 12 mg ml results show that the h2 yields and the apparent quantum yields by the preoxidized ha are comparable to those of the typical sacrificial agents i e methanol glucose and edta when phenol was used as substrate the h2 yield and apparent quantum yield was similar to that of the pure water suggesting that aromatic organic contaminants could not play a role of sacrificial reagent in addition the h2 production under optimal condition was repeated up for 5 cycles as shown in fig s7 the h2 production in the initial four cycles were obviously higher than the control experiment without organic substrates but the difference decreased with increasing number of cycles after the 5th cycle the h2 production was similar to that of the control suggesting negligible h2 was produced owing to the consumption of the intermediates 3 2 enhanced electron transfer by preoxidized ha in this study we demonstrate the degradation of ha and efficient photocatalytic h2 production on ha can be achieved in cascading two steps 1 the pre phase of oxic degradation and partial mineralization of ha 2 the post phase of anoxic photocatalytic reaction where h2 is produced using the organic intermediates on the contrast the untreated ha cannot improve h2 yield but substantially eliminate the photocatalytic h2 production activity suggesting the preoxidation process play a vital role in counteracting the detrimental effect of ha on the photocatalytic h2 production the underneath mechanism accounting for these observed effects are of great merit for the potential application of photocatalysis in h2 production generally the photocatalytic h2 production is related to the electron transfer from the conduction band cb of semiconductor photocatalysts to protons or water molecules which is usually denoted as water splitting therefore one possible mechanism for the improved h2 yield could be ascribed to the effect of the modification on the electron transfer process it is very plausible that the preoxidized ha played a role of sacrificial electron donors to promote the charge separation on the contrary in addition to light attenuation the untreated ha would likely adsorb on the tio2 surface and react directly with the photogenerated e thus quenching the reactivity before water could be split brame et al 2015 zhao et al 2019 the abilities of the untreated and preoxidized ha to mediate electron transfer were probed by measuring the photocurrent fig 3 a unless otherwise stated the preoxidized ha for 6 h which exhibited the best photocatalytic h2 production ability was selected for comparison the preoxidized ha displayed the highest steady state photocurrent density of 17 μa followed by the pure water 5 μa and then the untreated ha 2 μa the high photocurrent density indicated a high photo induced carrier separation efficiency in the preoxidized ha solution meanwhile the lower steady state photocurrent in the presence of untreated ha can be attributed to the limited light penetration as abovementioned this phenomena presumably support the hypothesis that the preoxidized organic substrates serve primarily as hole scavenger that enhance the reduction of water for a typical hole scavenger the inherent property is its high capacity to donate electron which means that it should have redox active functional groups that have high propensity to donate electron the presence of redox active functional in the preoxidized and untreated ha samples were further verified by cyclic voltammetry analysis fig 3b pure water produced cvs with no useful structure because of the lack of electrode activity as the applied potential increase from 0 6 v to 0 6 v vs ag agcl a well defined peak was obtained for the untreated ha on the basis of the correction to the peak potentials the redox potential of the untreated ha was estimated at 679 mv vs she however untreated ha substantially eliminate the h2 yield as compared with the pure water this can be ascribed to the negative effect of light blocking by untreated ha in the preoxidized ha solution two peaks were observed with the corrected redox potential of 599 mv and 524 mv vs she respectively the increased peak number signified the increased types of electron donors in the preoxidized ha samples moreover the lower redox potential implied that the intermediates in the preoxidized ha were more easily oxidized than that of the untreated ha we therefore can postulate that the redox active moieties in preoxidized ha as well as the elimination of the light blocking effect contribute to the improved h2 production in the successive anoxic phase 3 3 spectroscopic analyses 3 3 1 spectral slope ratio ultraviolet visible absorption spectral slope ratios sr is an index reversely correlated with average molecular weight and is routinely used as a proxy for nom samples helms et al 2008 ha is widely accepted as a high molecular weight macropolymer though ha do not have one specific characteristic structure a theoretical structure has been proposed by scientists to comprehend the complex structure of ha as illustrated in fig s8 hudson et al 2007 as shown in fig s9 under oxic condition the sr value of the untreated ha t 0 h increased progressively during the initial reaction time and underwent drastic drop from 5 h onward suggesting the reaction of high molecular weight compounds breaking into lower molecular weight compounds mainly occurred after 5 h corresponding to a uv fluence of 108 72 mj cm2 this result is consistent with previous report that photocatalytic oxic treatment was found to preferentially break down molecules with high molecular weights to form lower molecular weights molecules valencia et al 2014 phong and hur 2015 this phenomena also coincides with the photocatalytic h2 production results in the anoxic phase in which the preoxidized ha for 6 h yielding the maximum h2 it is very plausible that the transformation of molecular size play a role in boosting the h2 yield because smaller size molecules are considered to have more chance to interact with the photocatalysts under soluble diffusion limited conditions and thus leading to higher reactivity sun et al 2013 although a variety of organic substrates have been tested to replace the standard sacrificial reagent the effect of their molecular sizes have seldom been considered our results suggest that one advantage of preoxidation is to break down the macro structure of the pollutant to form smaller sized molecules that can be easily used in the subsequent h2 production phase 3 3 2 fluorescence eem fluorescence eem is a well established tool to get insights into the nature of the ha fig 4 illustrates the changes in eem spectra of ha during the oxic and anoxic photocatalytic treatment for the untreated ha t 0 h a prominent peak with ex em centered at 250 270 430 490 nm and a shoulder peak at 320 350 430 480 nm were identified which was corresponded to the peak a and peak c respectively in the literature hudson et al 2007 both the peak intensities decreased along with the oxic photocatalytic treatment indicating the decomposition of the structure of fluorophore in ha in the successive anoxic treatment using preoxidized ha for 6h as sacrificial reagent the eem fingerprints continued to disappear suggesting the remaining fluorophores were degraded in the anoxic phase the parafac modeling results in fig s10 supporting information resolve two independent components peaked at ex em 260 460 c1 and 230 320 435 c2 nm respectively c1 and c2 could be ascribed to the phenolic like and carboxylic like flurophores under oxic photocatalytic treatment the maximum fluorescence intensity fmax of c1 increased in the initial 1h and then decreased whereas the fmax of c2 decreased drastically in the initial 1h and then fluctuated fig s11 the increase of c1 in the initial 1 h can be attributed to the oxidation of the macro aromatic structure of ha to form phenolic like intermediates nevertheless both the fmax of c1 and c2 drop close to zero after 6 h this result together with the h2 production profile fig 2 suggested the fluorophore aromatic structure are not favorable for h2 production indeed ha are well documented to be excellent electron acceptors keller et al 2009 the decomposition of the aromatic structure in ha would likely improve the transfer of photo generated electron to proton instead of ha and contributed to the improved h2 yield 3 3 3 ftir and xps to examine the changes in the functional aspects of ha during the oxic anoxic photocatalytic treatment the structural and functional aspects of ha were analyzed by ftir and xps fig 5 presents the ftir spectra of ha samples the vibrations were mostly in the regions of 1750 950 cm 1 and assignment of major peaks are listed in table s2 we found that photocatalytic oxic pre treatment resulted in considerably decreased in the major peaks in 1570 1380 and 1085 cm 1 which were attributed to aromatic cc c o in phenolic oh and aromatic c h deformation hay and myneni 2007 yang et al 2009 chen et al 2014b wu et al 2017 meanwhile the peak intensities in 1700 1647 1155 and 1070 cm 1 corresponding to co in protonated carboxylic acid cooh co stretching in carboxylate coo c o alcohols carboxylic acids esters or ethers and aliphatic oh respectively were found to increase this is in line with previous reports that photocatalytic oxidation resulted in the oxygenation of the humic substances birben et al 2017 wu et al 2017 after the cascading photocatalytic anoxic treatment the peak intensities in 1700 1647 and 1115 cm 1 decreased indicating that the carboxyl and hydroxyl intermediates in the preoxidized ha were consumed in the anoxic photocatalytic h2 production process thus it can be speculated that hydroxyl and carboxylic groups were vital in facilitating the cascading photocatalytic h2 production process fig s12 of the supporting information presents the xps spectra recorded in the energy range 0 1100 ev for the ha samples the core level peaks of the xps spectra were c 1s 284 8 ev o 1s 532 0 ev and n 1s 400 0 ev high resolution scans of c 1s were performed to obtain the functional groups associated with these core level peaks fig 6 the c 1s peak can be decomposed into four individual peaks 1 the peak at 284 8 ev is an indicator of the presence of c c c h and aromatic c 2 the peak at 286 2 ev is attributed to c o from ether or alcohol 3 the peak at 287 8 ev is attributed to co or o c o as can be found in carboxylate amide carbonyl and acetal and 4 the peak at 289 0 ev results from the oc oh or oc or such as in ester or carboxyl groups the individually resolved peaks were numerically integrated to calculate concentration ratios and summarized in table s3 over an oxic photocatalytic degradation period of 6 h the c 1s peaks at 284 8 ev experienced reductions of 12 however the area of the c 1s peak at 286 2 287 8 and 289 0 ev increased by 7 3 and 2 respectively the c 1s data indicated that oxygen was enriched significantly in the functional groups of the ha during the pre oxidation period which might be due to the aerobic transformation of some functional groups for example aromatic c was transformed to co or c o after 1 h cascading anoxic photocatalytic treatment oxygenated c1s peaks at 286 2 and 287 8 ev decreased in peak area approximately 7 and 5 respectively and peak at the 289 0 ev remained unchanged additionally the concentrations of two typical oxygenated organics i e formic acid and oxalic acid were measured during the process fig 7 results indicated that the preoxidation process gave rise to both formic acid and oxalic acid concentration while these oxygenated compounds were significantly reduced after photocatalytic anoxic treatment these results were consistent with the ftir data and suggested that the photocatalytic oxic pre treatment lead to the oxidation of aromatic fractions in the ha to form carboxyl and hydroxyl containing intermediates and these oxygen rich intermediates possibly serve as sacrificial reagent in the subsequent anoxic photocatalytic process which promotes interfacial electron transfer and thus contributing to the enhanced h2 production indeed the oxygenated organic compounds with carboxyl or hydroxyl moieties such as methanol and carboxylic acids were widely used as sacrificial reagents in the photocatalytic systems due to their high propensity to donate electron while the alkylic or aromatic structures are weakly electron donating moieties due to their relatively low electrostatic potential remya and suresh 2016 in addition the aromatic structure in ha had been reported to have lower affinity to tio2 nanoparticles than carboxyl and hydroxyl groups as revealed by ftir analysis chen et al 2014a wu et al 2017 more specifically the high affinity of the tio2 surface for carboxylic acids is well studied and can be attributed to their bidentate binding balajka et al 2018 an illustration of typical carboxylic acids formic acid and oxalic acid can be found in fig s13 in the supporting information li et al 2003 the direct adsorption of sacrificial reagents on the tio2 surfaces is undoubtedly important for h2 production by photocatalysis because the scavenging of photo generated hole need direct interaction between the organic substrates and photocatalyst the formation of the oxygenated compounds such as formic acid and oxalic acid in the photocatalytic oxic process may enhance interaction between organic substrates and tio2 surface and thus enhanced the subsequent their oxidation and corresponding h2 production under anoxic condition although ha contains oxygenated side chains the macro structure of aromatic backbone in ha would decrease the nucleophiles of the electron donating moieties because of the large size and the corresponding steric hindrance effect hoffman 2004 which renders the approach of electron donating moieties to the photogenerated hole difficult moreover ha are redox active organic compounds that can be either oxidized or reduced by photocatalysis minero et al 1999 it is also possible that the adsorbed ha on the tio2 surface can block active sites for h2 evolution by scavenging the photo generated electrons as such it is very unlikely that the ha can be served as an efficient sacrificial reagent for photocatalytic h2 production our results herein showcase the advantages of preoxidation phase in which the ha were transformed to nucleophilic electron donating oxygenated intermediates notably there is also possibility that photocatalytic h2 production was proceeded by the partial conversion of the preoxidized organic substrates to produce molecular h2 as a result of the dehydrogenation of organic substrates in this case the generated h2 gas was originated from the hydrogen atoms on the organic substrates other than the water generally the discrimination between the two reaction routes can be achieved through isotopic labelling deuteration of either the organic substrates or water for instance kandiel et al 2014 employed deuterated water or deuterated methanol to study the photocatalytic h2 production on platinized tio2 photocatalysts they found that the h2 was mainly produced by the reduction of protons originating from water and the methanol only acted as a sacrificial reagent in such system however due to the lack of deuterated ha samples and the proxidation process can generate water from the ha which may interfere the isotopic study in the anoxic phase the discrimination between the two routes is challenging in this study nevertheless whatever the h2 production routes was proceeded the enhanced molecular h2 can be regarded as the reforming of the preoxidized organic substrates and the overall equation for the two pathways were identical which can be depicted as follow 2 preoxidized cxhyoz 2x z h2o xco2 2x 0 5y z h2 collectively the mechanisms by which the preoxidation counteracts the inhibitory effect of ha on photocatalytic h2 production can be rationalized by formation of smaller sized oxygenated organic intermediates which served as the sacrificial reagent to promote h2 production 3 4 technological implication the undesired role of sacrificial reagent has limited the application of photocatalysis for h2 production considerable efforts have also been devoted to replacing the valued sacrificial reagent with the organic pollutant in water to accomplish sustainable development in this study we envision a sustainable water remediation strategy based on a cascading oxic and anoxic photocatalytic treatment of ha specifically the photocatalytic oxic treatment preoxidation counteract the detrimental effect of ha by transforming the inert macrostructure of ha into electron donating intermediates whereas the toc content was slightly decreased the post phase of anoxic photocatalytic reaction generated h2 effectively using the preoxidized intermediates despite its notorious role in water industry ha is naturally obtained and abundant and thus can be regarded as a renewable resource for h2 production this means that the utilization of ha as electron donor feedstock for photocatalytic h2 production is a carbon neutral process in which the carbon dioxides produced from the oxidation of ha can be again recycled back to nature via plant photosynthesis within the time shorter than our lifetime shimura and yoshida 2011 while we acknowledge that the application of this photocatalytic oxic anoxic technology is still far from real practical application owing to the involvement of energy intensive uv facilities and the difficulty to capturing h2 at this relatively low pressure however this study showcased a perspective photocatalytic technology to achieve water treatment with h2 as a byproduct which can be capture through novel membrane technology perry et al 2006 ockwig and nenoff 2007 and dictate a new direction of future efforts to realize a sustainable photocatalytic water treatment technology yet tio2 is definitely not the best active photocatalyst to harvest the solar energy rational design and application of proper photocatalysts especially visible light driven photocatalysts will be of great value to assess their applicability for such system in the future furthermore 6 h of preoxidation treatment is also unrealistic in practical application however it should be noted that the light source used in this study is the long wavelength uv uva 315 400 nm while shorter wavelength uvc 100 280 nm is preferred and has been widely used in practical water treatment train phong and hur 2016 photocatalytic water treatment under uvc irradiation has been reported to be shown superior oxidation ability than under uva irradiation pigeot remy et al 2012 meanwhile it has been reported that uvc irradiation alone can greatly oxidize the nom as a result of photolysis parkinson et al 2003 therefore the time for preoxidation step is expected to be greatly reduced in practical application given that uvc facility is easily available in the water treatment plant and used as the light source on the other hand the findings are likely to be dependent on type of organics in various water environment for example dissolved effluent organic matter defom and textile dye waste are two common organic waste produced by human the defom typically comprises a heterogeneous mixture of refractory organic compounds such as soluble microbial products smp which are biologically derived and consists of mainly high molecular weight organics michael kordatou et al 2015 the textile dye waste are usually colored aromatic organics that have low biodegradability fu and viraraghavan 2001 provided that the low molecular weight oxygenated organics are better electron donor as demonstrated in this study it is very unlikely that these organic wastes can be directly used as effective sacrificial reagent for photocatalytic h2 production fortunately photocatalysis is well documented to be effective in degrading organics such as dyes houas et al 2001 and smp yu and huang 2020 to low molecular weight oxygenated intermediates in the presence of oxygen therefore the photocatalytic oxic anoxic treatment processes are also expected to shed light on the photocatalytic energy recovering treatment of wastewater such as textile wastewater and sewage wastewater effluent 4 conclusions this study envisions a sustainable water remediation strategy based on a cascading oxic and anoxic photocatalytic treatment of the naturally abundant ha a representative nom the major conclusions can be drawn as follows the untreated ha cannot serve as effective sacrificial reagent for photocatalytic h2 production but substantially inhibited h2 production the inhibitory effect can be ascribed to light attenuation and electron accepting by ha photocatalytic oxic pre treatment counteract the detrimental effect of ha due to the formation of low molecular weight oxygenated organic intermediates these intermediates acted as effective sacrificial reagent in the subsequent anoxic process the suitable alignment of photocatalytic oxic and anoxic processes which resemble the biological waste water treatment process pave a new way for energy recovering water purification process and have significant implication for future design of photocatalytic technologies declaration

18014,photocatalysis provides a green strategy to produce the clean energy of h2 however the realization of efficient h2 production is usually accomplished by the consumption of electron donors which are costly energy carriers themselves here we attempted to utilize the naturally abundant humic acid ha a representative natural organic matter nom as the source of electron donor in a cascading oxic anoxic photocatalytic system results showed that degradation of ha and remarkable h2 yield 1660 9 μmol g 1 h 1 at optimal condition were obtained successively whereas the anoxic photocatalytic treatment of pristine ha did not improve h2 yield but substantially eliminated the h2 production and ha degradation efficiency these phenomena suggested the preoxidation process played a vital role in counteracting the detrimental effect of ha on photocatalytic h2 production electrochemical measurement indicated that the preoxidized ha harbored more redox active moieties than the untreated ha and thus leading to a higher photo induced charge carrier separation efficiency a variety of advanced spectroscopic analyses revealed that the photocatalytic oxic pre treatment resulted in breakdown of chemically inert electron mediating and chromophoric aromatic macrostructure of ha to form smaller sized oxygenated organic intermediates these intermediates were more nucleophilic than the pristine ha and acted as sacrificial reagent in the subsequent anoxic process for boosting h2 production this study showcases an energy recovering water remediation process and paves the way for the design of novel photocatalytic technologies for environmental application graphical abstract image 1 keywords natural organic matter photocatalysis hydrogen production photocatalytic oxic anoxic process 1 introduction hydrogen h2 is being intensively investigated as an environmentally benign energy carrier for industry and daily life dunn 2002 to date however h2 is mainly derived from gas steam reforming from fossil fuels and natural gas at high temperature which in turn consume huge energy and emit large amount of greenhouse gas of co2 making the effective implementation of h2 economically and environmentally unsustainable hosseini and wahid 2016 thus cost effective and green h2 production methods are being actively sought to mitigate the environmental and energy issues an appealing method is solar h2 production from water splitting driven by photocatalysis ni et al 2007 the principles of photocatalytic water splitting are well documented and typically employs semiconductors e g tio2 as the photocatalyst upon irradiation the photogenerated electrons of the photocatalysts migrate to the conduction band or a cocatalyst e g pt which then reduce protons h or water molecules to generate h2 ni et al 2007 puga 2016 however the process employing pure water is usually rather inefficient or is not even operative for application schneider and bahnemann 2013 to improve the h2 yield numerous researches have been carried out in the presence of an excess of electron donors e g alcohols namely the sacrificial reagents as photogenerated holes are irreversibly scavenged by these sacrificial molecules and electron hole recombination can be greatly reduced resulting in higher conversion efficiency furthermore as o2 is not produced the thermodynamically favored backward reaction of h2 with o2 to form h2o is suppressed puga 2016 various organic substances such as alcohols fu et al 2011 organic acids zielinska et al 2008 and hydrocarbons hashimoto et al 1984 have been tested as sacrificial donors with different photocatalysts for h2 production in recent years however it is worth noting that these commonly used sacrificial reagents are valuable energy carriers themselves and obtained costly which hinders the application of such photocatalytic system in industry to address this challenge efforts ought to be devoted to replacing the expensive electron donors with naturally abundant materials or waste that must be disposed of puga 2016 indeed the effectiveness of photocatalysis has been intensively studied in water remediation and found to be successful in achieving degradation of numerous organic compounds in water tanaka et al 2000 gaya and abdullah 2008 ahmed et al 2011 it is therefore very attractive to develop photocatalytic technologies that combine water treatment with h2 production this approach is economically and environmentally sensible since h2 can be recovered as a fuel to reduce the total costs associated with water treatment the key for establishing such single step system lies in the synergy between the photocatalysts and the pollutants in which the electrons reduce the water protons and the hole or hole derived ros oxidize the pollutants selectively analogous to the situation when using standard sacrificial reagent kim et al 2012 however it should be noted that the characteristics of organic contaminants are very different from those of standard sacrificial reagents schneider and bahnemann 2013 for example typical sacrificial reagents e g alcohol aldehydes and carboxylic acids are small molecules with a tendency to donate electron whereas organic contaminants e g dyes hormones and pesticides are commonly both chemically inert and biologically recalcitrant baban et al 2010 ghattas et al 2017 therefore organic contaminants are commonly found to be inefficiently oxidized by photocatalysis in the absence of o2 anoxic condition kim and choi 2010 most reported values for the efficiencies of photocatalytic pollutant degradation and simultaneous h2 production were relatively low and even this technique was reported to be infeasible when using tio2 as the photocatalyst puga 2016 romao et al 2016 a few literature has reported that the realization of water remediation with simultaneous h2 production can be attained by surface modification of tio2 hybrid photocatalysts or using novel photocatalysts such as metal organic framework kim et al 2012 jiang et al 2018 kampouri et al 2018 despite their dual function in such single step system it is not known yet the key factors that determine their success in such system and how these photocatalysts distinguish from the other photocatalysts that did not perform well in such system moreover the fabrication of the dual function photocatalysts is generally a challenging process therefore it would be of great merit to develop new strategies to achieve energy recovering water treatment process that is applicable to universal photocatalysts such as tio2 which can be commercially available in large scale previously a research conducted by kim and choi 2010 has highlighted the possible benefits of combining the photocatalytic anoxic and oxic treatment in sequence which resembles the biological wastewater treatment process that comprised of cascading anaerobic and aerobic phases they demonstrated that the photocatalytic energy recovering water treatment process can be accomplished in two steps 1 anoxic degradation organic pollution in which h2 is produced and 2 the post phase of oxic degradation where the organic intermediates were mineralized as a matter of fact sequential adaptation of anoxic and oxic treatment is a commonly applied strategy in biological treatment of municipal wastewater treatment plants to achieve a combination of goals including organic degradation nitrification denitrification as well as energy production baeza et al 2004 zhao et al 2009 despite the advantage of simultaneous production of h2 and degradation of organic pollutants this photocatalytic anoxic oxic approach may not be applicable to photocatalysts that cannot achieve simultaneous pollutant degradation and h2 production in the first phase furthermore the organic intermediates were wasted without profitable output in the post phase of oxic degradation a recent study by our research group indicated that the organic intermediates other than the pristine organic pollutant could contribute to enhanced h2 production chu et al 2017 drawing inspiration from these studies it would be of great interest to switch the sequential treatment process to an alignment of photocatalytic oxic anoxic treatment in which the organic intermediates from the oxic treatment can be used as sacrificial reagent in the post anoxic phase for h2 production in addition organic pollutants are often encountered as multicomponent mixtures dao et al 2010 for example the natural organic matter nom are complex organic macromolecules that ubiquitously present in various environment including soils waters sediments matilainen et al 2011 nom is objectionable to water supplier and water end users because nom is resistant to biological oxidation and present a hazard as a precursor of potential harmful disinfection byproduct dbp e g trihalomethanes formed by water chlorination kitis et al 2001 in a typical water treatment plant the removal of nom is achieved in the coagulation process where the nom is transferred from the liquid to the solid phase as flocs using coagulants however it is often difficult to achieve reliable and effective coagulation particularly for water conditions that are highly variable sharp et al 2006 moreover there is always a significant fraction of nom recalcitrant to removal by coagulation processes fabris et al 2004 previous studies have proven that photocatalysis can be used as an effective method to degrade nom because of its potential to use sunlight to drive the process using a reusable catalyst bekbölet 1996 valencia et al 2013 besides nom is naturally abundant and plays a significant role in the global carbon cycle as one of the largest reservoirs of reduced carbon on the earth surface kujawinski et al 2009 for example the carbon in soil nom is estimated from 700 1015 to 3000 1015 g c which is in magnitude comparable to the atmospheric carbon aiken 1995 therefore nom is attractive as an easily available electron source for photocatalytic h2 production because of its high carbon content low cost and large availability previously klauson et al 2014 has used humic acid ha a representative nom as the substrate for photocatalytic h2 production under simulated solar light however the ha they used is a pure chemical with a specific characteristic structure which cannot reflect the complex nature of the multicomponent ha despite the wide presence of ha in the environment no literature has employed naturally derived and multicomponent ha as the substrate for photocatalytic h2 production in this work we explore an innovative cascading oxic anoxic photocatalytic system for the oxic degradation of ha and the successive anoxic h2 production using the intermediates from the post oxic phases model photocatalyst tio2 was used as the catalyst under uva led irradiation results show that the oxic pretreatment could counteract the inhibitory effect of ha on photocatalytic h2 production the corresponding mechanism was systematically probed by electrochemical measurements and a variety of advanced spectroscopic analyses this study may

anoxic photocatalytic treatment process ha were firstly treated in the oxic phase and then transfer to the successive anoxic treatment the preoxidized ha samples were filtered through a 0 45 μm

the freeze dried samples the major element composition was obtained via a broad survey scan with a 20 ev pass energy specific elements speciation was achieved via a high resolution scan with an 80 ev pass energy meng et al 2012 3 results and discussion 3 1 preoxidation reverses the inhibitory effect of ha the degree of ha degradation can be expressed by the change of uv254 which is attributable to the π π transitions of aromatic ring matilainen et al 2011 the evolution of ha and toc under photocatalytic oxic condition is shown in fig 1 prior to irradiation uv254 decreased slightly suggesting some ha were absorbed by tio2 when irradiation started uv254 decreased linearly along with oxic photocatalytic reaction time and reached a minimum of 1 3 m 1 after 8 h which is much lower than that of the untreated ha 86 8 m 1 this implied that the aromatic structure can be substantially degraded under oxic photocatalytic pretreatment conversely the toc followed a gradual decrease trend during the initial 6 h from 14 27 to 12 14 mg c l and then underwent a relatively fast drop to 9 07 mg c l at 8 h compared with the removal degree of uv254 99 the toc had a significantly lower removal degree 36 at 8 h these results implied that the transformation of organic pollutants mainly occurred during the initial of oxic photocatalytic process and the mineralization would need a relatively longer reaction time as compared with their degradation breakdown of pristine structure interestingly the spectrum of ha fig s1 was found to be shifted to the lower wavelength and a new shoulder peak ca 250 nm could be detected especially after 6 h oxic treatment this could be related to the formation of formation of new intermediate products in addition the photocatalytic degradation of ha under anoxic environment was also conducted for comparison fig s2 as shown in fig s3 the suva254 value of the untreated ha 6 2 l mg 1 m 1 underwent a significant decline to 0 4 l mg 1 m 1 an indication of nom of low aromaticity suva 2 mg 1 m 1 after 6 h photocatalytic oxic treatment after 8 h the suva254 further decreased to 0 1 mg 1 m 1 this value is much lower than the reported suva254 values 1 5 and 1 2 mg 1 m 1 of the finished water in two drinking water treatment trains that applied coagulation and filtration to remove nom baghoth et al 2011 this finding suggested the photocatalytic oxic treatment can significantly reduce the aromatic character of the ha in the treated water it was found that no obvious decrease in both uv254 and toc occurred in the de aerated suspension suggesting that oxygen is required for efficient degradation of ha this conclusion was further corroborated by the results of scavenger studies fig s4 which indicated that the o2 were predominantly involved in the degradation of ha considering the relatively low reactivity of o2 the contributing role of o2 in the degradation of ha could be attributed to the generation of highly oxidative oh derived from it long et al 2017 in short these results indicated that the oxic photocatalytic pretreatment was effective in the decomposition of ha but not the mineralization of ha this is of particular importance since the decomposed ha is assumed to serve as electron donors in the subsequent h2 production next the cascading photocatalytic h2 production experiments were conducted in the presence of the various pre oxidized ha under anoxic environment fig 2 the h2 production experiments using pure water and untreated ha were also carried out as references firstly the h2 evolution profiles for all the samples follow a linear trend as a function of irradiation time secondly the photocatalytic production of h2 in the absence of organic substrates i e in pure water was observed with a h2 generation rate of 116 0 μmol g 1 h 1 whereas no h2 was detected in the presence of untreated ha this indicated that the untreated ha could not serve as sacrificial reagent for boosting photocatalytic h2 production but substantially impeding the generation of h2 this could be ascribed to the fact that the untreated ha would compete with the photocatalysts for the uva light peak at 365 nm source fig s5 as the untreated ha t 0 h had strong absorbance in the region of 200 400 nm fig s1 as such the light attenuation by the untreated ha could be a reason for the inhibited h2 production thirdly in comparison with the control case without any organic substrate the photocatalytic h2 production was enhanced to different extent in the presence of preoxidized substrates and the h2 generation rates improved with increased preoxidation time and peaked at 1660 9 μmol g 1 h 1 during the initial 6 h however a marked decayed of h2 yield with the preoxidation time prolonged to 8 h 452 8 μmol g 1 h 1 this decrease of the h2 yield could be ascribed to decrease of preoxidized organic intermediates contents as reflected by the corresponding decrease in toc at 8 h fig 1 hence the preoxidation time of 6 h is the optimal condition for the subsequent h2 production in which the intermediates can be further mineralized as revealed by the toc evolution under anoxic condition fig s6 this h2 production profile highlighted the significance of preoxidation process and the preoxidized organic intermediates in enhancing the photocatalytic h2 production from ha to appreciate the significance of the photocatalytic h2 production from ha in the cascading oxic anoxic process photocatalytic h2 production experiments using other substrates were carried out table 1 for comparison standard aqueous solutions of methanol glucose phenol and edta were prepared at toc concentrations equivalent to that of the preoxidized ha for 6 h 12 mg ml results show that the h2 yields and the apparent quantum yields by the preoxidized ha are comparable to those of the typical sacrificial agents i e methanol glucose and edta when phenol was used as substrate the h2 yield and apparent quantum yield was similar to that of the pure water suggesting that aromatic organic contaminants could not play a role of sacrificial reagent in addition the h2 production under optimal condition was repeated up for 5 cycles as shown in fig s7 the h2 production in the initial four cycles were obviously higher than the control experiment without organic substrates but the difference decreased with increasing number of cycles after the 5th cycle the h2 production was similar to that of the control suggesting negligible h2 was produced owing to the consumption of the intermediates 3 2 enhanced electron transfer by preoxidized ha in this study we demonstrate the degradation of ha and efficient photocatalytic h2 production on ha can be achieved in cascading two steps 1 the pre phase of oxic degradation and partial mineralization of ha 2 the post phase of anoxic photocatalytic reaction where h2 is produced using the organic intermediates on the contrast the untreated ha cannot improve h2 yield but substantially eliminate the photocatalytic h2 production activity suggesting the preoxidation process play a vital role in counteracting the detrimental effect of ha on the photocatalytic h2 production the underneath mechanism accounting for these observed effects are of great merit for the potential application of photocatalysis in h2 production generally the photocatalytic h2 production is related to the electron transfer from the conduction band cb of semiconductor photocatalysts to protons or water molecules which is usually denoted as water splitting therefore one possible mechanism for the improved h2 yield could be ascribed to the effect of the modification on the electron transfer process it is very plausible that the preoxidized ha played a role of sacrificial electron donors to promote the charge separation on the contrary in addition to light attenuation the untreated ha would likely adsorb on the tio2 surface and react directly with the photogenerated e thus quenching the reactivity before water could be split brame et al 2015 zhao et al 2019 the abilities of the untreated and preoxidized ha to mediate electron transfer were probed by measuring the photocurrent fig 3 a unless otherwise stated the preoxidized ha for 6 h which exhibited the best photocatalytic h2 production ability was selected for comparison the preoxidized ha displayed the highest steady state photocurrent density of 17 μa followed by the pure water 5 μa and then the untreated ha 2 μa the high photocurrent density indicated a high photo induced carrier separation efficiency in the preoxidized ha solution meanwhile the lower steady state photocurrent in the presence of untreated ha can be attributed to the limited light penetration as abovementioned this phenomena presumably support the hypothesis that the preoxidized organic substrates serve primarily as hole scavenger that enhance the reduction of water for a typical hole scavenger the inherent property is its high capacity to donate electron which means that it should have redox active functional groups that have high propensity to donate electron the presence of redox active functional in the preoxidized and untreated ha samples were further verified by cyclic voltammetry analysis fig 3b pure water produced cvs with no useful structure because of the lack of electrode activity as the applied potential increase from 0 6 v to 0 6 v vs ag agcl a well defined peak was obtained for the untreated ha on the basis of the correction to the peak potentials the redox potential of the untreated ha was estimated at 679 mv vs she however untreated ha substantially eliminate the h2 yield as compared with the pure water this can be ascribed to the negative effect of light blocking by untreated ha in the preoxidized ha solution two peaks were observed with the corrected redox potential of 599 mv and 524 mv vs she respectively the increased peak number signified the increased types of electron donors in the preoxidized ha samples moreover the lower redox potential implied that the intermediates in the preoxidized ha were more easily oxidized than that of the untreated ha we therefore can postulate that the redox active moieties in preoxidized ha as well as the elimination of the light blocking effect contribute to the improved h2 production in the successive anoxic phase 3 3 spectroscopic analyses 3 3 1 spectral slope ratio ultraviolet visible absorption spectral slope ratios sr is an index reversely correlated with average molecular weight and is routinely used as a proxy for nom samples helms et al 2008 ha is widely accepted as a high molecular weight macropolymer though ha do not have one specific characteristic structure a theoretical structure has been proposed by scientists to comprehend the complex structure of ha as illustrated in fig s8 hudson et al 2007 as shown in fig s9 under oxic condition the sr value of the untreated ha t 0 h increased progressively during the initial reaction time and underwent drastic drop from 5 h onward suggesting the reaction of high molecular weight compounds breaking into lower molecular weight compounds mainly occurred after 5 h corresponding to a uv fluence of 108 72 mj cm2 this result is consistent with previous report that photocatalytic oxic treatment was found to preferentially break down molecules with high molecular weights to form lower molecular weights molecules valencia et al 2014 phong and hur 2015 this phenomena also coincides with the photocatalytic h2 production results in the anoxic phase in which the preoxidized ha for 6 h yielding the maximum h2 it is very plausible that the transformation of molecular size play a role in boosting the h2 yield because smaller size molecules are considered to have more chance to interact with the photocatalysts under soluble diffusion limited conditions and thus leading to higher reactivity sun et al 2013 although a variety of organic substrates have been tested to replace the standard sacrificial reagent the effect of their molecular sizes have seldom been considered our results suggest that one advantage of preoxidation is to break down the macro structure of the pollutant to form smaller sized molecules that can be easily used in the subsequent h2 production phase 3 3 2 fluorescence eem fluorescence eem is a well established tool to get insights into the nature of the ha fig 4 illustrates the changes in eem spectra of ha during the oxic and anoxic photocatalytic treatment for the untreated ha t 0 h a prominent peak with ex em centered at 250 270 430 490 nm and a shoulder peak at 320 350 430 480 nm were identified which was corresponded to the peak a and peak c respectively in the literature hudson et al 2007 both the peak intensities decreased along with the oxic photocatalytic treatment indicating the decomposition of the structure of fluorophore in ha in the successive anoxic treatment using preoxidized ha for 6h as sacrificial reagent the eem fingerprints continued to disappear suggesting the remaining fluorophores were degraded in the anoxic phase the parafac modeling results in fig s10 supporting information resolve two independent components peaked at ex em 260 460 c1 and 230 320 435 c2 nm respectively c1 and c2 could be ascribed to the phenolic like and carboxylic like flurophores under oxic photocatalytic treatment the maximum fluorescence intensity fmax of c1 increased in the initial 1h and then decreased whereas the fmax of c2 decreased drastically in the initial 1h and then fluctuated fig s11 the increase of c1 in the initial 1 h can be attributed to the oxidation of the macro aromatic structure of ha to form phenolic like intermediates nevertheless both the fmax of c1 and c2 drop close to zero after 6 h this result together with the h2 production profile fig 2 suggested the fluorophore aromatic structure are not favorable for h2 production indeed ha are well documented to be excellent electron acceptors keller et al 2009 the decomposition of the aromatic structure in ha would likely improve the transfer of photo generated electron to proton instead of ha and contributed to the improved h2 yield 3 3 3 ftir and xps to examine the changes in the functional aspects of ha during the oxic anoxic photocatalytic treatment the structural and functional aspects of ha were analyzed by ftir and xps fig 5 presents the ftir spectra of ha samples the vibrations were mostly in the regions of 1750 950 cm 1 and assignment of major peaks are listed in table s2 we found that photocatalytic oxic pre treatment resulted in considerably decreased in the major peaks in 1570 1380 and 1085 cm 1 which were attributed to aromatic cc c o in phenolic oh and aromatic c h deformation hay and myneni 2007 yang et al 2009 chen et al 2014b wu et al 2017 meanwhile the peak intensities in 1700 1647 1155 and 1070 cm 1 corresponding to co in protonated carboxylic acid cooh co stretching in carboxylate coo c o alcohols carboxylic acids esters or ethers and aliphatic oh respectively were found to increase this is in line with previous reports that photocatalytic oxidation resulted in the oxygenation of the humic substances birben et al 2017 wu et al 2017 after the cascading photocatalytic anoxic treatment the peak intensities in 1700 1647 and 1115 cm 1 decreased indicating that the carboxyl and hydroxyl intermediates in the preoxidized ha were consumed in the anoxic photocatalytic h2 production process thus it can be speculated that hydroxyl and carboxylic groups were vital in facilitating the cascading photocatalytic h2 production process fig s12 of the supporting information presents the xps spectra recorded in the energy range 0 1100 ev for the ha samples the core level peaks of the xps spectra were c 1s 284 8 ev o 1s 532 0 ev and n 1s 400 0 ev high resolution scans of c 1s were performed to obtain the functional groups associated with these core level peaks fig 6 the c 1s peak can be decomposed into four individual peaks 1 the peak at 284 8 ev is an indicator of the presence of c c c h and aromatic c 2 the peak at 286 2 ev is attributed to c o from ether or alcohol 3 the peak at 287 8 ev is attributed to co or o c o as can be found in carboxylate amide carbonyl and acetal and 4 the peak at 289 0 ev results from the oc oh or oc or such as in ester or carboxyl groups the individually resolved peaks were numerically integrated to calculate concentration ratios and summarized in table s3 over an oxic photocatalytic degradation period of 6 h the c 1s peaks at 284 8 ev experienced reductions of 12 however the area of the c 1s peak at 286 2 287 8 and 289 0 ev increased by 7 3 and 2 respectively the c 1s data indicated that oxygen was enriched significantly in the functional groups of the ha during the pre oxidation period which might be due to the aerobic transformation of some functional groups for example aromatic c was transformed to co or c o after 1 h cascading anoxic photocatalytic treatment oxygenated c1s peaks at 286 2 and 287 8 ev decreased in peak area approximately 7 and 5 respectively and peak at the 289 0 ev remained unchanged additionally the concentrations of two typical oxygenated organics i e formic acid and oxalic acid were measured during the process fig 7 results indicated that the preoxidation process gave rise to both formic acid and oxalic acid concentration while these oxygenated compounds were significantly reduced after photocatalytic anoxic treatment these results were consistent with the ftir data and suggested that the photocatalytic oxic pre treatment lead to the oxidation of aromatic fractions in the ha to form carboxyl and hydroxyl containing intermediates and these oxygen rich intermediates possibly serve as sacrificial reagent in the subsequent anoxic photocatalytic process which promotes interfacial electron transfer and thus contributing to the enhanced h2 production indeed the oxygenated organic compounds with carboxyl or hydroxyl moieties such as methanol and carboxylic acids were widely used as sacrificial reagents in the photocatalytic systems due to their high propensity to donate electron while the alkylic or aromatic structures are weakly electron donating moieties due to their relatively low electrostatic potential remya and suresh 2016 in addition the aromatic structure in ha had been reported to have lower affinity to tio2 nanoparticles than carboxyl and hydroxyl groups as revealed by ftir analysis chen et al 2014a wu et al 2017 more specifically the high affinity of the tio2 surface for carboxylic acids is well studied and can be attributed to their bidentate binding balajka et al 2018 an illustration of typical carboxylic acids formic acid and oxalic acid can be found in fig s13 in the supporting information li et al 2003 the direct adsorption of sacrificial reagents on the tio2 surfaces is undoubtedly important for h2 production by photocatalysis because the scavenging of photo generated hole need direct interaction between the organic substrates and photocatalyst the formation of the oxygenated compounds such as formic acid and oxalic acid in the photocatalytic oxic process may enhance interaction between organic substrates and tio2 surface and thus enhanced the subsequent their oxidation and corresponding h2 production under anoxic condition although ha contains oxygenated side chains the macro structure of aromatic backbone in ha would decrease the nucleophiles of the electron donating moieties because of the large size and the corresponding steric hindrance effect hoffman 2004 which renders the approach of electron donating moieties to the photogenerated hole difficult moreover ha are redox active organic compounds that can be either oxidized or reduced by photocatalysis minero et al 1999 it is also possible that the adsorbed ha on the tio2 surface can block active sites for h2 evolution by scavenging the photo generated electrons as such it is very unlikely that the ha can be served as an efficient sacrificial reagent for photocatalytic h2 production our results herein showcase the advantages of preoxidation phase in which the ha were transformed to nucleophilic electron donating oxygenated intermediates notably there is also possibility that photocatalytic h2 production was proceeded by the partial conversion of the preoxidized organic substrates to produce molecular h2 as a result of the dehydrogenation of organic substrates in this case the generated h2 gas was originated from the hydrogen atoms on the organic substrates other than the water generally the discrimination between the two reaction routes can be achieved through isotopic labelling deuteration of either the organic substrates or water for instance kandiel et al 2014 employed deuterated water or deuterated methanol to study the photocatalytic h2 production on platinized tio2 photocatalysts they found that the h2 was mainly produced by the reduction of protons originating from water and the methanol only acted as a sacrificial reagent in such system however due to the lack of deuterated ha samples and the proxidation process can generate water from the ha which may interfere the isotopic study in the anoxic phase the discrimination between the two routes is challenging in this study nevertheless whatever the h2 production routes was proceeded the enhanced molecular h2 can be regarded as the reforming of the preoxidized organic substrates and the overall equation for the two pathways were identical which can be depicted as follow 2 preoxidized cxhyoz 2x z h2o xco2 2x 0 5y z h2 collectively the mechanisms by which the preoxidation counteracts the inhibitory effect of ha on photocatalytic h2 production can be rationalized by formation of smaller sized oxygenated organic intermediates which served as the sacrificial reagent to promote h2 production 3 4 technological implication the undesired role of sacrificial reagent has limited the application of photocatalysis for h2 production considerable efforts have also been devoted to replacing the valued sacrificial reagent with the organic pollutant in water to accomplish sustainable development in this study we envision a sustainable water remediation strategy based on a cascading oxic and anoxic photocatalytic treatment of ha specifically the photocatalytic oxic treatment preoxidation counteract the detrimental effect of ha by transforming the inert macrostructure of ha into electron donating intermediates whereas the toc content was slightly decreased the post phase of anoxic photocatalytic reaction generated h2 effectively using the preoxidized intermediates despite its notorious role in water industry ha is naturally obtained and abundant and thus can be regarded as a renewable resource for h2 production this means that the utilization of ha as electron donor feedstock for photocatalytic h2 production is a carbon neutral process in which the carbon dioxides produced from the oxidation of ha can be again recycled back to nature via plant photosynthesis within the time shorter than our lifetime shimura and yoshida 2011 while we acknowledge that the application of this photocatalytic oxic anoxic technology is still far from real practical application owing to the involvement of energy intensive uv facilities and the difficulty to capturing h2 at this relatively low pressure however this study showcased a perspective photocatalytic technology to achieve water treatment with h2 as a byproduct which can be capture through novel membrane technology perry et al 2006 ockwig and nenoff 2007 and dictate a new direction of future efforts to realize a sustainable photocatalytic water treatment technology yet tio2 is definitely not the best active photocatalyst to harvest the solar energy rational design and application of proper photocatalysts especially visible light driven photocatalysts will be of great value to assess their applicability for such system in the future furthermore 6 h of preoxidation treatment is also unrealistic in practical application however it should be noted that the light source used in this study is the long wavelength uv uva 315 400 nm while shorter wavelength uvc 100 280 nm is preferred and has been widely used in practical water treatment train phong and hur 2016 photocatalytic water treatment under uvc irradiation has been reported to be shown superior oxidation ability than under uva irradiation pigeot remy et al 2012 meanwhile it has been reported that uvc irradiation alone can greatly oxidize the nom as a result of photolysis parkinson et al 2003 therefore the time for preoxidation step is expected to be greatly reduced in practical application given that uvc facility is easily available in the water treatment plant and used as the light source on the other hand the findings are likely to be dependent on type of organics in various water environment for example dissolved effluent organic matter defom and textile dye waste are two common organic waste produced by human the defom typically comprises a heterogeneous mixture of refractory organic compounds such as soluble microbial products smp which are biologically derived and consists of mainly high molecular weight organics michael kordatou et al 2015 the textile dye waste are usually colored aromatic organics that have low biodegradability fu and viraraghavan 2001 provided that the low molecular weight oxygenated organics are better electron donor as demonstrated in this study it is very unlikely that these organic wastes can be directly used as effective sacrificial reagent for photocatalytic h2 production fortunately photocatalysis is well documented to be effective in degrading organics such as dyes houas et al 2001 and smp yu and huang 2020 to low molecular weight oxygenated intermediates in the presence of oxygen therefore the photocatalytic oxic anoxic treatment processes are also expected to shed light on the photocatalytic energy recovering treatment of wastewater such as textile wastewater and sewage wastewater effluent 4 conclusions this study envisions a sustainable water remediation strategy based on a cascading oxic and anoxic photocatalytic treatment of the naturally abundant ha a representative nom the major conclusions can be drawn as follows the untreated ha cannot serve as effective sacrificial reagent for photocatalytic h2 production but substantially inhibited h2 production the inhibitory effect can be ascribed to light attenuation and electron accepting by ha photocatalytic oxic pre treatment counteract the detrimental effect of ha due to the formation of low molecular weight oxygenated organic intermediates these intermediates acted as effective sacrificial reagent in the subsequent anoxic process the suitable alignment of photocatalytic oxic and anoxic processes which resemble the biological waste water treatment process pave a new way for energy recovering water purification process and have significant implication for future design of photocatalytic technologies declaration
