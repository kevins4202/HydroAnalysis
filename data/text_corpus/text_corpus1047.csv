5235,sandified soil slope in the semiarid ecosystems can affect overland flow velocity to accelerate soil erosion and increase sandification for a better understanding of flow hydraulics in wind water erosion zone of loess plateau a computation method was suggested to estimate rill flow velocities over sand incorporation slope surface of sand loess soil mixture the sandified slopes involved three sand incorporation rates of 10 20 50 as light medium and severe levels of sandification under four inflow discharges 1 2 4 and 8 l min 1 and four slope gradients 5 10 15 and 25 the measured electrolyte signals over sand incorporation surfaces were found to be initially smooth in the rising limbs after the electrolyte solution arrived at the measurement location part of the solute infiltrated into the surface sand layer the electrolyte solute was absorbed by the sand layer before being slowly released into the water flow this part should be deleted before overland flow velocity estimation compared with published data over loess slopes velocities over sand incorporation surface were increased by an average of 69 54 30 for sand incorporation rates of 10 20 and 50 respectively incorporation of sand particles into soil could have protected soil surface from being eroded to form rougher rill morphology to increased flow velocity but higher sand content also could have increased the surface frictional resistance to reduce the increase rate of overland flow velocity for aeolian sand incorporated loess slope both linear regression and stepwise regression implied a positive dependency of velocities on flow rates and slope gradients but a negative dependency on sand incorporation rates the results will improve the understanding of overland flow hydraulics on sandified slopes keywords flow velocity electrolyte tracing method sandified soil soil erosion overland flow 1 introduction overland flow velocity over hillslope has direct influences on soil erosion and sediment transportation which is an important hydrodynamic parameter of process based soil water erosion modelling gimenez et al 2004 govers 1992 muegler et al 2011 wirtz et al 2012 soils become sandified in semiarid and arid regions especially in degraded farmlands under conditions affected by long term wind and water erosion the fraction of coarse textured particles was increased after fine textured soil was eroded by water and aeolian sand particles by wind erosion cumulatively deposited and incorporated into the surface soil under conditions of possible sand intrusion farmlands are more likely become sandified sandified rangelands are widely distributed in mid east asia northwestern china northern america sub sahara africa and australia d odorico et al 2013 covering approximately 41 of the earth s land territory and home to approximately 35 of the global population reynolds et al 2007 those lands in arid and semi arid regions are particularly susceptible to both wind and water erosion leading to different levels of desertification van pelt et al 2017 land degradation is associated with soil being increasingly coarser textured in china severe land sandification has caused various socioeconomic problems shifted land utilization from cropland to rangeland or desert during the last several decades especially in the agro pastoral transition zones farmlands are seriously impacted by both wind and water erosions this region is characterized by strong wind erosion in winter and spring and water erosion in summer and autumn tuo et al 2018 the total area under this situation reaches an area of about 0 81 million km2 high and alternative wind and water erosions can cause removal of fine particles and intrusion of coarser particles therefore both the erosions have the impacts to accelerate the process of soil sandification these can cause change in soil physical properties and lead to low soil fertility and decreased vegetation cover tuo et al 2018 recent research has identified the water wind erosion region as one of the major sediment sources of yellow river and aeolian sand from mu us sandy land and other nearby deserts accelerated the erosion rate in this region zhang et al 2017 coarse aeolian sand intrusion into farmland can also be incorporated into loess soil of plough layer by tillage operation and may lead agricultural soil to be coarsely textured accordingly soil particle compositions change due to coarse particle accumulation and incorporation is associated with land degradation processes the coarse particles in soil could also affect overland water flow velocity and soil erosion and sediment delivery rate by water flow depths of overland flow are of the same order of size as roughness elements in the flume bed and the flow conditions from laminar regime to turbulent regime are typically found nearing et al 1997 to quantify the hydraulic behavior of overland flow flow velocity is the most important and commonly used parameter many methods have been practiced to estimate the velocity of overland water flow tracing techniques are widely adopted in flow velocity measurement nearing et al 1999 such as the overland flow velocities on rock incorporated slope surface ban et al 2017b nearing et al 2017 rieke zapp et al 2007 synthetic mulch incorporated slope surface poesen and lavee 1991 straw mulch covered slope surface rahma et al 2013 common techniques applied in the literature were based on the travel time of a tracer across a certain distance abrantes et al 2018 legout et al 2012 zhang et al 2010 a variety of tracers were used such as the salt electrolyte tracing abrantes et al 2018 fluorescent dye tracing zhang et al 2010 infrared thermography de lima and abrantes 2014 radioactive isotopes payne 1988 magnetized materials adrian 1991 fluorescent particles tauro et al 2012 and floating objects tauro and grimaldi 2017 measurement accuracy of tracing technique can be affected by retention of tracer in water flow according to flury and wai 2003 an ideal tracer for shallow flow hydraulic researches should not be degraded or absorbed by substances such as the soil and sand particles in water flow during the measurement in fact most commonly used tracers are not ideal on erodible slope surfaces exchanges of tracer between the soil and water flow exist as long as sediment detachment and deposition continue as soil particles both in the flow and in the slope bed can absorb and release the tracer substances by solute convection and dispersion transport dye tracer retention in background environment makes tracer less clearly distinguishable and accurate determination of centroid and peak value of dye tracer plume is challenged it also involves complex data acquisition procedures and sophisticated image processing zhang et al 2010 dye tracing correction factor for overland flow velocity varies from 0 233 to 0 783 and is inversely related to sediment load and slope gradient on non erodible slope surface zhang et al 2010 and positively related to grain size ali et al 2012 when the flow velocity is higher than 0 4 m s 1 the correction factor of dye tracing results unacceptable large errors in velocity estimation ali et al 2012 different tracing correction factors indicate a significant effect of sediment particle size distribution on rill flow velocity gimenez et al 2004 nearing et al 1997 therefore the determination of correction factor could be complicated and it seems unreasonable to apply correction factor based tracing techniques on sandified slopes flow velocity measurements have been practiced over a variety of sedimentary conditions such as rock incorporated slope surface ban et al 2017b nearing et al 2017 rieke zapp et al 2007 synthetic mulch incorporated slope surface poesen and lavee 1991 straw mulch covered slope surface rahma et al 2013 and so on but on sand incorporated slope surface it is yet to be done recently electrolyte solution as an alternative of dye tracer has been widely applied in tracing overland flow electrolyte solution dispersed and absorbed in water and soil interface is presumably to cause tracer retention especially on erodible beds such electrolyte tracers of high solubility as nacl and kcl are easy to get and are non intrusive to the overland flow hydrological processes abrantes et al 2018 calkins and dunne 1970 gonzalez pinzon et al 2013 nearing et al 2017 and electrolyte tracers are applied in the automatic flow tracing systems and erosion modeling lei et al 2005 rahma et al 2013 recently the applications of electrolyte tracing technique with analytical solute transport model gave precise predictions of overland flow velocities on loamy soil surface which was protected by strong crust of polyester resin and acetone planchon et al 2005 on loess soil mulched by straw rahma et al 2013 on non erodible gravel layers shi et al 2015 on non erodible sandpapers dong et al 2014 on frozen soil slopes ban et al 2017a those slope surfaces are characterized by a low erodibility and a limited interaction with the water flow on eroding bed the strong erosion would lead to a loose sediment deposition layer near bed surface the sediment deposition layer facilitates a higher infiltration rate and solute advective transport into soil solute transport data in the soil which is adjacent to bed water interface does not represent the solute transport of overland flow but is detected by the sensors of measurement system and therefore comprises a series of retention data in the measured solute transport process the retention data prompt the hypothesis that analytical solute transport modelling in overland flow would be influenced by solute transport in soil media and only by omitting retention data could the model give reasonable estimates of overland flow velocities on erodible bed overland flow velocities have been investigated on a variety of sedimentary conditions on rock covered slopes flow velocities are reduced as a function of increased rock coverage because of increased hydraulic roughness abrahams and parsons 1994 nearing et al 2017 for soil mixed with rock fragments rocks act as form roughness elements in overland flow and thus create drag and dissipate flow energy lawrence 2000 rieke zapp et al 2007 on well sorted non cohesive sand slopes mean flow velocities are progressively lower with the increase in sediment size abrahams et al 1996 ali et al 2012 however to our knowledge researches of the flow hydraulics over sand incorporated loess slopes are not reported yet electrolyte tracer method by lei et al 2005 is an alternative in rill flow velocity measurement however the applicability of this method for measuring flow velocity on sand incorporated loess slope is yet to be tested overland flow velocity measurement on sand incorporated loess slope will help to understand the effects of soil particle sizes on hydraulics and provide required datasets for soil erosion dynamic process the present study used the electrolyte tracer method under pulse boundary condition to 1 suggest a method for estimating water flow velocity from measured solute transport process over sandified slopes with bias errors 2 measure rill flow velocity soil slopes with different sand incorporation rates slope gradients and water flow discharges 3 identify that the flow velocity on sand incorporated slope was significantly higher than that on slope of loess soil and higher sand incorporation rate produced lower increase rate in flow velocity 2 methodology 2 1 experiment materials and method rill flumes in fig 1 were constructed on a slope adjustable platform in the hydraulic experimental hall of china agricultural university steel sheets 0 3 m high and 2 m long were used to build the rills on the platform 8 m long and 1 2 m wide at a 0 1 m interval distance four steel sheets were connected end to end i to form an 8 m long rill wall eleven rill walls were made from steel sheets on the platform to divide the entire frame into 12 rill flumes each 8 m long 0 1 m wide and 0 3 m high net surface area of 0 8 m2 steel sheets were reinforced by steel tubes to maintain a constant 0 1 m width between flume walls all rill flumes were filled with the prepared soil sand mixture to a depth of 0 2 m afterward each flume soil surface was covered by a gauze cloth sheet before water was sprayed to the soil layer until it was fully saturated saturated soils in rill flumes were equilibrated for 12 h to minimize the effect of un even distribution of soil water content on erosion processes the gauze cloth was removed before the experimental platform was set to the designated slope gradients to conduct an experiment water flow at designated rate was supplied by a peristaltic pump flow rate to run the experiment a gauze cloth 20 cm long and 0 1 m wide was laid beneath water pipe outlet to prevent immediate strong erosion of the soil surface to compensate the loss of water flow rate the lost water amount due to infiltration was estimated by the saturated conductivity of the soil sand mixture in the area the infiltration amount was added to the designed flow rate to ensure that the flow rates at the flume outlet reached the experimental designated flow rates the rotation speeds of the peristatic pump was adjusted in accordance with the final required flow rates table 1 lists the saturated hydraulic conductivity and water contents of the different soil sand mixture materials four slope gradients 5 10 15 and 25 and four flow rates 1 2 4 8 and l min 1 were used in the experiments with three replicates the experimental soil materials were collected from ansai county 37 32 n and 108 24 e which is a typical silt loam widely distributed in the agro pastoral joint zone in northern china the aeolian sand materials were collected from the nearby qubqi desert 38 54 n and 110 22 e from sand dunes near the abandoned farmlands and therefore could be representative of the sand materials incorporated into the plow layer soil of the agro pastoral joint zone soil and sand materials were air dried before being passed through 4 mm sieve to remove crop residues and rocks afterward the soil and sand materials at three mass based rates namely 9 1 8 2 and 5 5 were mixed evenly by using a mechanical cement blender these three types of prepared soil sand mixtures with median grain diameters of 0 047 0 066 and 0 310 mm consisted 10 20 and 50 incorporated sand contents respectively the sand soil mixtures were filled into experimental flumes to a depth of 20 cm by four layers with 5 cm interval each surface between soil layers was raked before another layer was laid to maintain soil consistency the final soil surface was smoothed with a lever to simulate a well prepared seedling bed as soon as rill flow was stabilized the measurement was initiated and the concentrated salt solution was injected into the water flow the electrolyte conductivity signal was measured by the sensors located at nine positions before using a computer software to estimate rill flow velocities 2 2 solute transport model electrolyte tracer method based on the convection and dispersion mechanism of salt transport in flowing water was suggested by lei et al 2005 in estimating overland flow velocities electrolyte conductivity were detected by nine sensors in the rill at 0 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 and 8 m distances from flume inlet each sensor had two electrodes made of stainless needles and was inserted into the soil about 4 cm deep all sensors were linked to data logger by cable wires a solenoid valve which controlled the injection of high concentration salt solution kcl was also linked to the data logger the whole system was controlled by a specially designed computer software once the water flow in the rill flume stabilized and produced sediment laden mixtures at rill outlet the solenoid valve opened and released salt solutions about 3 ml into the rill flow electrolyte conductivity data were recorded by the data logger and calculated into the electrolyte concentration data by software and solute transfer modelling by equations 1 3 was done by the software too lei et al 2005 the overland flow on sandified slopes was assumed as steady flow and treated as one dimensional along the flow path the convectional and dispersion transportation of the solute was described by a partial differential equation as eq 1 based on fick s law and mass conservation law the flow velocities as equation parameters were determined by regressing the measured data with the solution of eq 1 by the least square method 1 c t u c x x d h c x where c is the electrolyte concentration kg m 3 x represents the slope length m t is the time s dh is the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient m2 s 1 and u is the flow velocity m s 1 to solve eq 1 the upper boundary condition is given as a pulse function and the initial and the lower boundary conditions for eq 1 are given as the following 2a c x t c 0 δ t x 0 2b c x t 0 x 2c c x t 0 t 0 the solution of eq 2 is given by lei et al 2015 as a time dependent function 3 c x t c 0 x 2 t π d h t exp x u t 2 4 d h t fitting the experimentally obtained data with eq 3 can determine the initial concentration c0 and the flow velocity u as well as the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient dh 2 3 method for computing flow velocity from measured data with bias errors for electrolyte tracing on non erodible rills there is no significant electrolyte retention because the fraction of solute transport from the overland flow to the soil media is small therefore solute advective transport in rill bed soils does not influence the solute transport in overland flow the solution transport process is denoted here as perfect when part of the solution transport process is used for flow velocity estimation as given in fig 2 b the fitting process produces a set of estimated values of c0 u and dh they are the same as those produced by fitting with the whole solute transport process in fig 2 a the computed flow velocities given in table 2 were virtually the same this demonstrates that fitting the whole solute transport process or part of the process is equally tables 3 and 4 feasible the analytical solute transport model by lei et al 2005 is applicable under perfect pulse boundary condition which cannot solve the problem when infiltration is fast such as in sandified soils i e sand soil mixture a sandified soil itself has high infiltration rate when water flows over a sandified slope fine soil particles may be eroded and coarser sand particles remain to cause even higher infiltration rate therefore the water flow infiltrates the sandified soil layer so does the solute component in the flowing water this happens during the rising limb fig 3 a of the solute movement till the concentration peak after the peak point solute transport in the water flow starts its recession limb to reduce its concentration electrolyte solution in water flow starts to reduce its concentration and the solutes previously infiltrated into the sandified soil layer become gradually higher than that in the water flow due to lower hydraulic conductivity of the sandified soil layer the salt solution in the sandified soil layer was released relatively slowly into the flowing water the slow release of solution from the soil layer to the water flow causes the recession limb of solute transport process to reduce slowly to produce higher solute concentration than without solute release from sandified soil layer this phenomenon is shown in the red circles of fig 3 and fig 4 this part needs a very long time to end and the recession limb of solute transport cannot rapidly get to balance status the process is affected by the hydraulic conductivity of the sandified soil and its depth when this imperfectly measured solute transport process is used to estimated velocity of the water flow by fitting it with the analytic solution to partial differential equation of solute transport in water flow high bias errors can be expected as shown in fig 3 and fig 4 the regressed recession limb as shown by the dash curve is much affected by the bias errors which is far away from the actual recession part of solute transport as the curve of white circles the curve as affected by this phenomenon did not represent the actual solute transport in water flow itself but also it cause imperfect solute transport curve when fitting a curve of this kind can cause systematic error in estimated velocity as indicated by fig 3 and fig 4 when part of the solute transport process affected by slow release of infiltrated salt solute is not used during the process to estimate the flow velocity by fitting measured data with the analytic solution the estimated water flow velocity is not affected in consideration of the problem discussed above a method is suggested in this study to estimate flow velocity the group of data points polluted by the infiltration release process of solute should be excluded from the data set for velocity estimation this means only the data set which form the smooth rising part and the initial and smooth part of the recession limb was used for flow velocity estimation therefore the data set in the recession part which was not significantly affected by solute release from the sandified soil layer shown in fig 3 and fig 4 was used to fit the analytical solution equation eq 3 to produce the water flow velocity fig 3 is for the slope of 15 under flow rate of 4 l min and 50 sand content and fig 4 is for the slope of 25 under flow rate of 1 l min and 50 sand content the black colored data points were those used for flow velocity estimation fig 3 shows both the measured data set used to estimate water flow velocity the white circle curve and the fitting curve by the analytical solution as the smooth curve the fitted curve is also plotted in fig 4 both fig 3 and fig 4 show that the fitted curves by using mainly the rising limb and a small part of recession part fig 3a and 4a the rising limb and major part of recession limb fig 3b and 4b or the rising limb and recession limb with some bias data points fig 3c 3d and 4c 4d follow well with the main parts of the solute transport process but not follow the bias error curves the computed flow velocities by the rising limb and part of recession limb were basically the same especially when all the recession or falling limbs were exclusive to computational data set only the rising limb such as the cases in fig 3a and 3b was used for velocity estimation the measured velocity is almost identical this demonstrated that the proposed method of estimating flow velocity is feasible and the data set of the rising limb is the best part to be used for flow velocity estimation but when part of the data set in the falling limb was included in the computation the estimated velocity though with some error was still very good approximation of the accurate velocity with the methodology for velocity estimation from measured data sets with bias measurement errors supplied the flow velocity was estimated with one more step required which is to identify the critical point between the rising and falling limbs of the electrolyte transport curve upon the determination of this critical point the data set which was not polluted by solute release from infiltrated soil profile can be used to accurately estimate the water flow velocity 3 results 3 1 electrolyte transport process modeling from imperfectly measured data part of the experimentally measured data at all slope gradients and incorporated sand contents under 2 l min flow rate were presented in figs 5 and those under 4 l min were in figs 6 with bias data points excluded from the entire measured dataset for flow velocity computation the normalized electrolyte processes and fitted curves of 2 l min 1 flow rate under different combinations of slope gradients and incorporated sand contents in figs 5a and 5b showed good agreement with the analytical solute transport model without the part of the imperfectly measured processes the normalized salt solution transport signals were shown as circles the normalized concentration values were fitted with eq 1 and modelling results were presented as smooth curves nine normalized concentration curves with decreasing peak values represented a time dependent solute transport process at flume locations of 0 1 m from rill inlet and 1 8 m at 1 m increment from rill inlet all the coefficients of determination were higher than 0 8 to show good applicability and feasibility of newly suggested procedures in rill flow velocity modelling as soil erosion along the rill flume developed the velocity values in rill positions from 3 m to 8 m stabilized and were revealed by the uniform distribution of fitted curves along the time axis the stabilized velocity values from various positions had minimal variance due to the equilibrium between gravitational force acceleration and rill surface roughness resistance dong et al 2013 3 2 impacts of incorporated sand contents on flow velocity the measured flow velocities under different slope gradients flow rates and incorporated sand contents are presented in table 5 standard deviations are presented underneath velocity variations among different replicates are possibly due to rill channel meandering and the stochastic nature of rill flow wright and webster 1991 as rills over an erodible bed are characterized with irregularity in profile and cross section and rarely have any regular geometrical shape foster et al 1984 based on the estimated velocities in table 5 the reynold s number re and the froude number fr were calculated as proposed by nearing et al 1997 4 r qw 2 q w 2 u 5 re ru ν 6 fr u gh where w is the flow width m which is deemed as 0 1 m of the flume width q is the flow rate l min 1 u is the averaged flow velocity m s 1 r is the hydraulic radius m ν is the kinematic viscosity h is the flow depth m g is the gravitational acceleration m s 2 the reynolds s number is a dimensionless number to characterize flow regimes the laminar flow or turbulent flow the froude number characterizes the subcritical flow for fr 1 and supercritical flow for fr greater than 1 indicating the interaction between the flow depth and velocity in this research the reynold s number ranged from 150 to 1350 and all the froude numbers larger than 1 the flow conditions in the experiments are determined to be super critical laminar and super critical turbulent flows according to the classification by nearing et al 1997 flow velocities were regressed to slope gradients by a linear function as 7 u k s b where u is the flow velocity m s 1 s is the slope gradient k is the slope of the fitted line and b is the intercept fig 7 shows the data points and fitted lines and table 6 lists the regression parameters k and b in fig 7 each regressed line represents the effect of slope gradients on flow velocities and a steep regression line indicated a considerable effect by slope gradients for each incorporated sand content group the regression line became steeper and the effect of slope gradients on flow velocities increased under increased flow rates for a given flow rate the increase in flow velocity over a low sand content rill surface was fast the fitted parameters listed in table 6 showed a consistent trend with flow rates and sand contents parameters k and b for each sand content increased with flow rates thereby indicating a fast increase in flow velocities the k values from 2 82 to 1 16 under 10 sand content were higher than values under 20 from 1 68 to 0 92 and higher than the values from 2 39 to 0 65 under 10 incorporated sand contents except for k of 2 84 under 20 sand content large values of k indicated that low sand content had a considerable effect on flow velocities under a certain flow rate with the increase in slope gradient from 5 to 25 the b values also increased with the flow rates 0 123 to 0 311 0 128 to 0 258 0 141 to 0 222 and decreased when the incorporated sand content was high except for b under a flow rate of 1 l min 1 as shown in fig 8 rill velocity increased with flow rate and slope gradient in all treatments on sand incorporated loess slope rill velocity decreased with incorporated sand content tables 7a and 7b list the increased proportions in flow velocities of adjacent flow rates and adjacent slope gradients respectively the proportions were positive from 4 to 60 indicating that flow velocities increased with flow rates and slope gradients different increased proportions also indicated that the effects of incorporated sand contents on flow velocities varied under various slope gradients and flow rates for flow rates from 1 l min 1 to 2 l min 1 the increased proportions over 50 sand content were lower than those over 10 and 20 sand contents as flow rates increased to 4 and 8 l min 1 the increased proportions over 50 sand content were higher than 30 and mostly higher than those over 10 and 20 sand contents for slope gradients from 5 to 10 the increased proportions over 50 sand content were lower than 10 and lower than those over 10 and 20 sand contents as slope gradients increased from 10 to 15 the increased proportions increased with the largest proportion of 55 3 3 flow velocity variations with down slope distance after the rill flow stabilized an equilibrium between rill hydraulics and sediment transport was established the flow velocities in figs 9 11 from sensor numbers 4 9 theoretically would be relatively similar and very little the errors introduced by differences in bias data points among various incorporated sand contents were considered to be negligible infiltration rates of all three sand mixtures were small compared with the total flow discharge therefore electrolyte transport process on sand incorporated loess slope was reasonable to estimate flow velocity by the rising part of the electrolyte conductivity this method was recommended to improve model results for velocity measurement 4 discussion 4 1 quantitative analysis of influential factors flow velocities over sandified soil slope showed significant dependency on sand content slope gradient and flow rate a multiple variable analysis was conducted via step wise regression method by using pasw statistic software to differentiate all influential factors a quadratic multiple variable regression equation with all influential factors and their combined terms was used as follows 8 u a 0 a 1 c a 2 s a 3 q a 4 c s a 5 c q a 6 s q a 7 c 2 a 8 s 2 a 9 q 2 where u represents the flow velocities m s 1 c is the incorporated sand content s is the slope gradient q is the flow rate l min 1 a1 a2 a3 a4 a5 a6 a7 a8 and a9 stand for regression coefficients and a0 is the constant term a0 0 188 a1 0 269 a2 0 009 a3 0 019 a6 0 002 in eq 6 f 183 47 p 0 01 and a4 a5 a7 a8 and a9 were all omitted in the stepwise regression regressed the experimental data with eq 8 yields the following equation 9 u 0 188 0 269 c 0 009 s 0 019 q 0 002 q s the dataset was effectively fitted using the regression equation with a coefficient of determination of 0 93 eq 9 indicates that rill velocities over sand incorporated loess slope were positively correlated with slope gradients and flow rates and their interaction term with positive coefficients but it is negatively correlated with incorporated sand contents fig 12 presents that the predicted flow velocities by eq 9 are well correlated with the measured dataset linear correlation between the measured and predicted datasets suggested that eq 9 can well predict the flow velocities with a linear fitting parameter of 0 94 the decrease of flow velocity with higher sand incorporation rate in our research is consistent with results by ali et al 2012 for sandified loess slope of higher sand incorporation rate the fraction of coarse texture sand particles is increased which implies a larger median grain size diameter in research of ali et al 2012 overland flow velocity is lower with the median grain size increasing from 0 23 to 1 02 mm but the non significant effect of slope on overland flow velocity by ali et al 2012 does not agree with the conclusions of this research the possible reason is that the well sorted non cohesive sand particles used by ali et al 2012 are quite different from the loess sand mixtures in terms of grain size distribution another possible reason is the gentle slopes 3 10 from which velocity data are derived by ali et al 2012 are quite different from the slope degrees 5 25 in this experiment the estimated velocities over sandified loess surface range from 0 18 to 0 96 m s 1 which is similar to the velocity reported by huang et al 2018 the research by huang et al 2018 also indicates a significant dependency of overland flow velocity on slope degree which agrees with results suggested by eq 9 4 2 increased in flow velocity over sandified and non sandified loess slopes velocities of water flow on sand incorporated rill surface were significantly higher than those on loess soil slope linear regression showed that flow velocities increased with decreased incorporated sand contents or decreased with increase in sand content but loess soil slope without sand incorporation maintained the lowest rill velocities as shown in fig 13 flow velocities on loess slopes by ban et al 2017 were plotted in fig 13 against datasets over sand incorporated loess slopes for comparing purposes linear regression parameters of 1 69 1 54 and 1 30 indicated that rill velocities over sandified loess slopes with 10 20 and 50 sand incorporated contents were 1 69 1 54 and 1 30 times of that on bare loess slope respectively increase in flow velocities over sandified loess slopes could be explained by exposure of deposited sand particles in the eroded rill bed in fig 4 and in fig 14 the sand incorporated soil rills were eroded by concentrated water flow the finer soil particles were selectively eroded by the water flow the coarse sand particle fraction was remained seen in fig 14 with erosion impacts increasing more fine soil particles was eroded and delivered by water flow more sand particles deposited or exposed at the surface of the soil slope fig 14 the sand layer armored slope surface to make it even more difficult to be eroded or scoured water flow tended to erode the surface soil materials from a wider area so that the rill spread wider fig 14 and smoother as a result there were not many headcuts along the rill as in fig 1 exposure of sand particles at the soil surface may increase frictional force component that can result in reduction in flow velocity as indicated by eq 9 but less occurrence of headcuts in the rill reduced local energy consumption by waterfalls better and straight rill morphology is beneficial for water flow to increase its velocity all these seem explain the reasons that sandified soil slope promote higher flow velocity and higher sand content with higher friction to water flow reduces the magnitude of increase in water flow velocity the armoring effect of sand particles on eroding surface was consistent the results by blom et al 2008 in which vertical winnowing resulted a selectively removement of fine particles and left a subsurface layer material richer in fine particles for interrill erosion on slope surface which was incorporated with coarse textured particles the process of soil armoring by selective removal of finer particles was shown to reduce soil loss by cochrane et al 2019 and the lower energy consumption by reduced soil loss tended to accelerated water flow velocity ali et al 2012 willgoose and sharmeen 2006 with sand incorporated into loess soil the mean diameter of eroded materials increased as shown in fig 15 and the probability for concentrated water flow to detach and transport large particles increased rill flow energy was preferentially consumed through sediment particle detachment and transportation instead of increasing flow velocity ali et al 2012 the gravitational momentum transferred to sediment transportation rather than flow acceleration would increase with increasing sand content moreover decreased flow velocities with increased sand content were reasonable 5 conclusion land degradation caused by aeolian sand incorporation into farmland soil in arid and semi arid areas poses a great threat to sustainable ecosystem and catchment management with fine soil particles detached and coarse aeolian sand deposited and incorporated into plough layer soil along tillage soil particle size distributions are progressively dominated by coarse particle fractions by which sedimentary conditions of rill erosion are altered on sandified slope surface with different incorporated sand contents salt tracing processes with analytical solute transport method for shallow flow velocity measurement was influenced by water tracer retention in the soil and sand mixture layer and therefore can not give reasonable estimates of flow velocities by comparing model results of whole perfect measured processes with those of partial perfect measured processes analytical solute transport model was testified to give accurate velocity measurements when solute conductivity data in the recessing limb were omitted from whole dataset and was later used in bias measured transport processes with lag data points influenced by tracer retention to be omitted the analytical solute transport model was first applied on sandified soil flumes and estimated rill flow velocities well modelling results showed that rill flow velocities were positively correlated with flow rates and slope gradients whereas negatively correlated with incorporated sand contents due to increased coarse particle roughness but rill flow velocities on sand incorporated slopes were higher than those on bare loess slope surface under the same hydraulic conditions possible explanations were that sand particles deposited and accumulated as an armor layer to prevent rill incision and reduce rill surface morphologic variations by less headcuts developed with erosion processes as a key hydraulic parameter of concentrated flow routing and sediment transportation research rill velocities on aeolian incorporated sand slopes give new insight in the understanding of sandified soil erosion dynamics and initial data interpretation would further optimize the strategies of catchment management and ecosystem restoration in wind water compound erosion areas future work with a focus on effect of aeolian sand on soil

5235,sandified soil slope in the semiarid ecosystems can affect overland flow velocity to accelerate soil erosion and increase sandification for a better understanding of flow hydraulics in wind water erosion zone of loess plateau a computation method was suggested to estimate rill flow velocities over sand incorporation slope surface of sand loess soil mixture the sandified slopes involved three sand incorporation rates of 10 20 50 as light medium and severe levels of sandification under four inflow discharges 1 2 4 and 8 l min 1 and four slope gradients 5 10 15 and 25 the measured electrolyte signals over sand incorporation surfaces were found to be initially smooth in the rising limbs after the electrolyte solution arrived at the measurement location part of the solute infiltrated into the surface sand layer the electrolyte solute was absorbed by the sand layer before being slowly released into the water flow this part should be deleted before overland flow velocity estimation compared with published data over loess slopes velocities over sand incorporation surface were increased by an average of 69 54 30 for sand incorporation rates of 10 20 and 50 respectively incorporation of sand particles into soil could have protected soil surface from being eroded to form rougher rill morphology to increased flow velocity but higher sand content also could have increased the surface frictional resistance to reduce the increase rate of overland flow velocity for aeolian sand incorporated loess slope both linear regression and stepwise regression implied a positive dependency of velocities on flow rates and slope gradients but a negative dependency on sand incorporation rates the results will improve the understanding of overland flow hydraulics on sandified slopes keywords flow velocity electrolyte tracing method sandified soil soil erosion overland flow 1 introduction overland flow velocity over hillslope has direct influences on soil erosion and sediment transportation which is an important hydrodynamic parameter of process based soil water erosion modelling gimenez et al 2004 govers 1992 muegler et al 2011 wirtz et al 2012 soils become sandified in semiarid and arid regions especially in degraded farmlands under conditions affected by long term wind and water erosion the fraction of coarse textured particles was increased after fine textured soil was eroded by water and aeolian sand particles by wind erosion cumulatively deposited and incorporated into the surface soil under conditions of possible sand intrusion farmlands are more likely become sandified sandified rangelands are widely distributed in mid east asia northwestern china northern america sub sahara africa and australia d odorico et al 2013 covering approximately 41 of the earth s land territory and home to approximately 35 of the global population reynolds et al 2007 those lands in arid and semi arid regions are particularly susceptible to both wind and water erosion leading to different levels of desertification van pelt et al 2017 land degradation is associated with soil being increasingly coarser textured in china severe land sandification has caused various socioeconomic problems shifted land utilization from cropland to rangeland or desert during the last several decades especially in the agro pastoral transition zones farmlands are seriously impacted by both wind and water erosions this region is characterized by strong wind erosion in winter and spring and water erosion in summer and autumn tuo et al 2018 the total area under this situation reaches an area of about 0 81 million km2 high and alternative wind and water erosions can cause removal of fine particles and intrusion of coarser particles therefore both the erosions have the impacts to accelerate the process of soil sandification these can cause change in soil physical properties and lead to low soil fertility and decreased vegetation cover tuo et al 2018 recent research has identified the water wind erosion region as one of the major sediment sources of yellow river and aeolian sand from mu us sandy land and other nearby deserts accelerated the erosion rate in this region zhang et al 2017 coarse aeolian sand intrusion into farmland can also be incorporated into loess soil of plough layer by tillage operation and may lead agricultural soil to be coarsely textured accordingly soil particle compositions change due to coarse particle accumulation and incorporation is associated with land degradation processes the coarse particles in soil could also affect overland water flow velocity and soil erosion and sediment delivery rate by water flow depths of overland flow are of the same order of size as roughness elements in the flume bed and the flow conditions from laminar regime to turbulent regime are typically found nearing et al 1997 to quantify the hydraulic behavior of overland flow flow velocity is the most important and commonly used parameter many methods have been practiced to estimate the velocity of overland water flow tracing techniques are widely adopted in flow velocity measurement nearing et al 1999 such as the overland flow velocities on rock incorporated slope surface ban et al 2017b nearing et al 2017 rieke zapp et al 2007 synthetic mulch incorporated slope surface poesen and lavee 1991 straw mulch covered slope surface rahma et al 2013 common techniques applied in the literature were based on the travel time of a tracer across a certain distance abrantes et al 2018 legout et al 2012 zhang et al 2010 a variety of tracers were used such as the salt electrolyte tracing abrantes et al 2018 fluorescent dye tracing zhang et al 2010 infrared thermography de lima and abrantes 2014 radioactive isotopes payne 1988 magnetized materials adrian 1991 fluorescent particles tauro et al 2012 and floating objects tauro and grimaldi 2017 measurement accuracy of tracing technique can be affected by retention of tracer in water flow according to flury and wai 2003 an ideal tracer for shallow flow hydraulic researches should not be degraded or absorbed by substances such as the soil and sand particles in water flow during the measurement in fact most commonly used tracers are not ideal on erodible slope surfaces exchanges of tracer between the soil and water flow exist as long as sediment detachment and deposition continue as soil particles both in the flow and in the slope bed can absorb and release the tracer substances by solute convection and dispersion transport dye tracer retention in background environment makes tracer less clearly distinguishable and accurate determination of centroid and peak value of dye tracer plume is challenged it also involves complex data acquisition procedures and sophisticated image processing zhang et al 2010 dye tracing correction factor for overland flow velocity varies from 0 233 to 0 783 and is inversely related to sediment load and slope gradient on non erodible slope surface zhang et al 2010 and positively related to grain size ali et al 2012 when the flow velocity is higher than 0 4 m s 1 the correction factor of dye tracing results unacceptable large errors in velocity estimation ali et al 2012 different tracing correction factors indicate a significant effect of sediment particle size distribution on rill flow velocity gimenez et al 2004 nearing et al 1997 therefore the determination of correction factor could be complicated and it seems unreasonable to apply correction factor based tracing techniques on sandified slopes flow velocity measurements have been practiced over a variety of sedimentary conditions such as rock incorporated slope surface ban et al 2017b nearing et al 2017 rieke zapp et al 2007 synthetic mulch incorporated slope surface poesen and lavee 1991 straw mulch covered slope surface rahma et al 2013 and so on but on sand incorporated slope surface it is yet to be done recently electrolyte solution as an alternative of dye tracer has been widely applied in tracing overland flow electrolyte solution dispersed and absorbed in water and soil interface is presumably to cause tracer retention especially on erodible beds such electrolyte tracers of high solubility as nacl and kcl are easy to get and are non intrusive to the overland flow hydrological processes abrantes et al 2018 calkins and dunne 1970 gonzalez pinzon et al 2013 nearing et al 2017 and electrolyte tracers are applied in the automatic flow tracing systems and erosion modeling lei et al 2005 rahma et al 2013 recently the applications of electrolyte tracing technique with analytical solute transport model gave precise predictions of overland flow velocities on loamy soil surface which was protected by strong crust of polyester resin and acetone planchon et al 2005 on loess soil mulched by straw rahma et al 2013 on non erodible gravel layers shi et al 2015 on non erodible sandpapers dong et al 2014 on frozen soil slopes ban et al 2017a those slope surfaces are characterized by a low erodibility and a limited interaction with the water flow on eroding bed the strong erosion would lead to a loose sediment deposition layer near bed surface the sediment deposition layer facilitates a higher infiltration rate and solute advective transport into soil solute transport data in the soil which is adjacent to bed water interface does not represent the solute transport of overland flow but is detected by the sensors of measurement system and therefore comprises a series of retention data in the measured solute transport process the retention data prompt the hypothesis that analytical solute transport modelling in overland flow would be influenced by solute transport in soil media and only by omitting retention data could the model give reasonable estimates of overland flow velocities on erodible bed overland flow velocities have been investigated on a variety of sedimentary conditions on rock covered slopes flow velocities are reduced as a function of increased rock coverage because of increased hydraulic roughness abrahams and parsons 1994 nearing et al 2017 for soil mixed with rock fragments rocks act as form roughness elements in overland flow and thus create drag and dissipate flow energy lawrence 2000 rieke zapp et al 2007 on well sorted non cohesive sand slopes mean flow velocities are progressively lower with the increase in sediment size abrahams et al 1996 ali et al 2012 however to our knowledge researches of the flow hydraulics over sand incorporated loess slopes are not reported yet electrolyte tracer method by lei et al 2005 is an alternative in rill flow velocity measurement however the applicability of this method for measuring flow velocity on sand incorporated loess slope is yet to be tested overland flow velocity measurement on sand incorporated loess slope will help to understand the effects of soil particle sizes on hydraulics and provide required datasets for soil erosion dynamic process the present study used the electrolyte tracer method under pulse boundary condition to 1 suggest a method for estimating water flow velocity from measured solute transport process over sandified slopes with bias errors 2 measure rill flow velocity soil slopes with different sand incorporation rates slope gradients and water flow discharges 3 identify that the flow velocity on sand incorporated slope was significantly higher than that on slope of loess soil and higher sand incorporation rate produced lower increase rate in flow velocity 2 methodology 2 1 experiment materials and method rill flumes in fig 1 were constructed on a slope adjustable platform in the hydraulic experimental hall of china agricultural university steel sheets 0 3 m high and 2 m long were used to build the rills on the platform 8 m long and 1 2 m wide at a 0 1 m interval distance four steel sheets were connected end to end i to form an 8 m long rill wall eleven rill walls were made from steel sheets on the platform to divide the entire frame into 12 rill flumes each 8 m long 0 1 m wide and 0 3 m high net surface area of 0 8 m2 steel sheets were reinforced by steel tubes to maintain a constant 0 1 m width between flume walls all rill flumes were filled with the prepared soil sand mixture to a depth of 0 2 m afterward each flume soil surface was covered by a gauze cloth sheet before water was sprayed to the soil layer until it was fully saturated saturated soils in rill flumes were equilibrated for 12 h to minimize the effect of un even distribution of soil water content on erosion processes the gauze cloth was removed before the experimental platform was set to the designated slope gradients to conduct an experiment water flow at designated rate was supplied by a peristaltic pump flow rate to run the experiment a gauze cloth 20 cm long and 0 1 m wide was laid beneath water pipe outlet to prevent immediate strong erosion of the soil surface to compensate the loss of water flow rate the lost water amount due to infiltration was estimated by the saturated conductivity of the soil sand mixture in the area the infiltration amount was added to the designed flow rate to ensure that the flow rates at the flume outlet reached the experimental designated flow rates the rotation speeds of the peristatic pump was adjusted in accordance with the final required flow rates table 1 lists the saturated hydraulic conductivity and water contents of the different soil sand mixture materials four slope gradients 5 10 15 and 25 and four flow rates 1 2 4 8 and l min 1 were used in the experiments with three replicates the experimental soil materials were collected from ansai county 37 32 n and 108 24 e which is a typical silt loam widely distributed in the agro pastoral joint zone in northern china the aeolian sand materials were collected from the nearby qubqi desert 38 54 n and 110 22 e from sand dunes near the abandoned farmlands and therefore could be representative of the sand materials incorporated into the plow layer soil of the agro pastoral joint zone soil and sand materials were air dried before being passed through 4 mm sieve to remove crop residues and rocks afterward the soil and sand materials at three mass based rates namely 9 1 8 2 and 5 5 were mixed evenly by using a mechanical cement blender these three types of prepared soil sand mixtures with median grain diameters of 0 047 0 066 and 0 310 mm consisted 10 20 and 50 incorporated sand contents respectively the sand soil mixtures were filled into experimental flumes to a depth of 20 cm by four layers with 5 cm interval each surface between soil layers was raked before another layer was laid to maintain soil consistency the final soil surface was smoothed with a lever to simulate a well prepared seedling bed as soon as rill flow was stabilized the measurement was initiated and the concentrated salt solution was injected into the water flow the electrolyte conductivity signal was measured by the sensors located at nine positions before using a computer software to estimate rill flow velocities 2 2 solute transport model electrolyte tracer method based on the convection and dispersion mechanism of salt transport in flowing water was suggested by lei et al 2005 in estimating overland flow velocities electrolyte conductivity were detected by nine sensors in the rill at 0 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 and 8 m distances from flume inlet each sensor had two electrodes made of stainless needles and was inserted into the soil about 4 cm deep all sensors were linked to data logger by cable wires a solenoid valve which controlled the injection of high concentration salt solution kcl was also linked to the data logger the whole system was controlled by a specially designed computer software once the water flow in the rill flume stabilized and produced sediment laden mixtures at rill outlet the solenoid valve opened and released salt solutions about 3 ml into the rill flow electrolyte conductivity data were recorded by the data logger and calculated into the electrolyte concentration data by software and solute transfer modelling by equations 1 3 was done by the software too lei et al 2005 the overland flow on sandified slopes was assumed as steady flow and treated as one dimensional along the flow path the convectional and dispersion transportation of the solute was described by a partial differential equation as eq 1 based on fick s law and mass conservation law the flow velocities as equation parameters were determined by regressing the measured data with the solution of eq 1 by the least square method 1 c t u c x x d h c x where c is the electrolyte concentration kg m 3 x represents the slope length m t is the time s dh is the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient m2 s 1 and u is the flow velocity m s 1 to solve eq 1 the upper boundary condition is given as a pulse function and the initial and the lower boundary conditions for eq 1 are given as the following 2a c x t c 0 δ t x 0 2b c x t 0 x 2c c x t 0 t 0 the solution of eq 2 is given by lei et al 2015 as a time dependent function 3 c x t c 0 x 2 t π d h t exp x u t 2 4 d h t fitting the experimentally obtained data with eq 3 can determine the initial concentration c0 and the flow velocity u as well as the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient dh 2 3 method for computing flow velocity from measured data with bias errors for electrolyte tracing on non erodible rills there is no significant electrolyte retention because the fraction of solute transport from the overland flow to the soil media is small therefore solute advective transport in rill bed soils does not influence the solute transport in overland flow the solution transport process is denoted here as perfect when part of the solution transport process is used for flow velocity estimation as given in fig 2 b the fitting process produces a set of estimated values of c0 u and dh they are the same as those produced by fitting with the whole solute transport process in fig 2 a the computed flow velocities given in table 2 were virtually the same this demonstrates that fitting the whole solute transport process or part of the process is equally tables 3 and 4 feasible the analytical solute transport model by lei et al 2005 is applicable under perfect pulse boundary condition which cannot solve the problem when infiltration is fast such as in sandified soils i e sand soil mixture a sandified soil itself has high infiltration rate when water flows over a sandified slope fine soil particles may be eroded and coarser sand particles remain to cause even higher infiltration rate therefore the water flow infiltrates the sandified soil layer so does the solute component in the flowing water this happens during the rising limb fig 3 a of the solute movement till the concentration peak after the peak point solute transport in the water flow starts its recession limb to reduce its concentration electrolyte solution in water flow starts to reduce its concentration and the solutes previously infiltrated into the sandified soil layer become gradually higher than that in the water flow due to lower hydraulic conductivity of the sandified soil layer the salt solution in the sandified soil layer was released relatively slowly into the flowing water the slow release of solution from the soil layer to the water flow causes the recession limb of solute transport process to reduce slowly to produce higher solute concentration than without solute release from sandified soil layer this phenomenon is shown in the red circles of fig 3 and fig 4 this part needs a very long time to end and the recession limb of solute transport cannot rapidly get to balance status the process is affected by the hydraulic conductivity of the sandified soil and its depth when this imperfectly measured solute transport process is used to estimated velocity of the water flow by fitting it with the analytic solution to partial differential equation of solute transport in water flow high bias errors can be expected as shown in fig 3 and fig 4 the regressed recession limb as shown by the dash curve is much affected by the bias errors which is far away from the actual recession part of solute transport as the curve of white circles the curve as affected by this phenomenon did not represent the actual solute transport in water flow itself but also it cause imperfect solute transport curve when fitting a curve of this kind can cause systematic error in estimated velocity as indicated by fig 3 and fig 4 when part of the solute transport process affected by slow release of infiltrated salt solute is not used during the process to estimate the flow velocity by fitting measured data with the analytic solution the estimated water flow velocity is not affected in consideration of the problem discussed above a method is suggested in this study to estimate flow velocity the group of data points polluted by the infiltration release process of solute should be excluded from the data set for velocity estimation this means only the data set which form the smooth rising part and the initial and smooth part of the recession limb was used for flow velocity estimation therefore the data set in the recession part which was not significantly affected by solute release from the sandified soil layer shown in fig 3 and fig 4 was used to fit the analytical solution equation eq 3 to produce the water flow velocity fig 3 is for the slope of 15 under flow rate of 4 l min and 50 sand content and fig 4 is for the slope of 25 under flow rate of 1 l min and 50 sand content the black colored data points were those used for flow velocity estimation fig 3 shows both the measured data set used to estimate water flow velocity the white circle curve and the fitting curve by the analytical solution as the smooth curve the fitted curve is also plotted in fig 4 both fig 3 and fig 4 show that the fitted curves by using mainly the rising limb and a small part of recession part fig 3a and 4a the rising limb and major part of recession limb fig 3b and 4b or the rising limb and recession limb with some bias data points fig 3c 3d and 4c 4d follow well with the main parts of the solute transport process but not follow the bias error curves the computed flow velocities by the rising limb and part of recession limb were basically the same especially when all the recession or falling limbs were exclusive to computational data set only the rising limb such as the cases in fig 3a and 3b was used for velocity estimation the measured velocity is almost identical this demonstrated that the proposed method of estimating flow velocity is feasible and the data set of the rising limb is the best part to be used for flow velocity estimation but when part of the data set in the falling limb was included in the computation the estimated velocity though with some error was still very good approximation of the accurate velocity with the methodology for velocity estimation from measured data sets with bias measurement errors supplied the flow velocity was estimated with one more step required which is to identify the critical point between the rising and falling limbs of the electrolyte transport curve upon the determination of this critical point the data set which was not polluted by solute release from infiltrated soil profile can be used to accurately estimate the water flow velocity 3 results 3 1 electrolyte transport process modeling from imperfectly measured data part of the experimentally measured data at all slope gradients and incorporated sand contents under 2 l min flow rate were presented in figs 5 and those under 4 l min were in figs 6 with bias data points excluded from the entire measured dataset for flow velocity computation the normalized electrolyte processes and fitted curves of 2 l min 1 flow rate under different combinations of slope gradients and incorporated sand contents in figs 5a and 5b showed good agreement with the analytical solute transport model without the part of the imperfectly measured processes the normalized salt solution transport signals were shown as circles the normalized concentration values were fitted with eq 1 and modelling results were presented as smooth curves nine normalized concentration curves with decreasing peak values represented a time dependent solute transport process at flume locations of 0 1 m from rill inlet and 1 8 m at 1 m increment from rill inlet all the coefficients of determination were higher than 0 8 to show good applicability and feasibility of newly suggested procedures in rill flow velocity modelling as soil erosion along the rill flume developed the velocity values in rill positions from 3 m to 8 m stabilized and were revealed by the uniform distribution of fitted curves along the time axis the stabilized velocity values from various positions had minimal variance due to the equilibrium between gravitational force acceleration and rill surface roughness resistance dong et al 2013 3 2 impacts of incorporated sand contents on flow velocity the measured flow velocities under different slope gradients flow rates and incorporated sand contents are presented in table 5 standard deviations are presented underneath velocity variations among different replicates are possibly due to rill channel meandering and the stochastic nature of rill flow wright and webster 1991 as rills over an erodible bed are characterized with irregularity in profile and cross section and rarely have any regular geometrical shape foster et al 1984 based on the estimated velocities in table 5 the reynold s number re and the froude number fr were calculated as proposed by nearing et al 1997 4 r qw 2 q w 2 u 5 re ru ν 6 fr u gh where w is the flow width m which is deemed as 0 1 m of the flume width q is the flow rate l min 1 u is the averaged flow velocity m s 1 r is the hydraulic radius m ν is the kinematic viscosity h is the flow depth m g is the gravitational acceleration m s 2 the reynolds s number is a dimensionless number to characterize flow regimes the laminar flow or turbulent flow the froude number characterizes the subcritical flow for fr 1 and supercritical flow for fr greater than 1 indicating the interaction between the flow depth and velocity in this research the reynold s number ranged from 150 to 1350 and all the froude numbers larger than 1 the flow conditions in the experiments are determined to be super critical laminar and super critical turbulent flows according to the classification by nearing et al 1997 flow velocities were regressed to slope gradients by a linear function as 7 u k s b where u is the flow velocity m s 1 s is the slope gradient k is the slope of the fitted line and b is the intercept fig 7 shows the data points and fitted lines and table 6 lists the regression parameters k and b in fig 7 each regressed line represents the effect of slope gradients on flow velocities and a steep regression line indicated a considerable effect by slope gradients for each incorporated sand content group the regression line became steeper and the effect of slope gradients on flow velocities increased under increased flow rates for a given flow rate the increase in flow velocity over a low sand content rill surface was fast the fitted parameters listed in table 6 showed a consistent trend with flow rates and sand contents parameters k and b for each sand content increased with flow rates thereby indicating a fast increase in flow velocities the k values from 2 82 to 1 16 under 10 sand content were higher than values under 20 from 1 68 to 0 92 and higher than the values from 2 39 to 0 65 under 10 incorporated sand contents except for k of 2 84 under 20 sand content large values of k indicated that low sand content had a considerable effect on flow velocities under a certain flow rate with the increase in slope gradient from 5 to 25 the b values also increased with the flow rates 0 123 to 0 311 0 128 to 0 258 0 141 to 0 222 and decreased when the incorporated sand content was high except for b under a flow rate of 1 l min 1 as shown in fig 8 rill velocity increased with flow rate and slope gradient in all treatments on sand incorporated loess slope rill velocity decreased with incorporated sand content tables 7a and 7b list the increased proportions in flow velocities of adjacent flow rates and adjacent slope gradients respectively the proportions were positive from 4 to 60 indicating that flow velocities increased with flow rates and slope gradients different increased proportions also indicated that the effects of incorporated sand contents on flow velocities varied under various slope gradients and flow rates for flow rates from 1 l min 1 to 2 l min 1 the increased proportions over 50 sand content were lower than those over 10 and 20 sand contents as flow rates increased to 4 and 8 l min 1 the increased proportions over 50 sand content were higher than 30 and mostly higher than those over 10 and 20 sand contents for slope gradients from 5 to 10 the increased proportions over 50 sand content were lower than 10 and lower than those over 10 and 20 sand contents as slope gradients increased from 10 to 15 the increased proportions increased with the largest proportion of 55 3 3 flow velocity variations with down slope distance after the rill flow stabilized an equilibrium between rill hydraulics and sediment transport was established the flow velocities in figs 9 11 from sensor numbers 4 9 theoretically would be relatively similar and very little the errors introduced by differences in bias data points among various incorporated sand contents were considered to be negligible infiltration rates of all three sand mixtures were small compared with the total flow discharge therefore electrolyte transport process on sand incorporated loess slope was reasonable to estimate flow velocity by the rising part of the electrolyte conductivity this method was recommended to improve model results for velocity measurement 4 discussion 4 1 quantitative analysis of influential factors flow velocities over sandified soil slope showed significant dependency on sand content slope gradient and flow rate a multiple variable analysis was conducted via step wise regression method by using pasw statistic software to differentiate all influential factors a quadratic multiple variable regression equation with all influential factors and their combined terms was used as follows 8 u a 0 a 1 c a 2 s a 3 q a 4 c s a 5 c q a 6 s q a 7 c 2 a 8 s 2 a 9 q 2 where u represents the flow velocities m s 1 c is the incorporated sand content s is the slope gradient q is the flow rate l min 1 a1 a2 a3 a4 a5 a6 a7 a8 and a9 stand for regression coefficients and a0 is the constant term a0 0 188 a1 0 269 a2 0 009 a3 0 019 a6 0 002 in eq 6 f 183 47 p 0 01 and a4 a5 a7 a8 and a9 were all omitted in the stepwise regression regressed the experimental data with eq 8 yields the following equation 9 u 0 188 0 269 c 0 009 s 0 019 q 0 002 q s the dataset was effectively fitted using the regression equation with a coefficient of determination of 0 93 eq 9 indicates that rill velocities over sand incorporated loess slope were positively correlated with slope gradients and flow rates and their interaction term with positive coefficients but it is negatively correlated with incorporated sand contents fig 12 presents that the predicted flow velocities by eq 9 are well correlated with the measured dataset linear correlation between the measured and predicted datasets suggested that eq 9 can well predict the flow velocities with a linear fitting parameter of 0 94 the decrease of flow velocity with higher sand incorporation rate in our research is consistent with results by ali et al 2012 for sandified loess slope of higher sand incorporation rate the fraction of coarse texture sand particles is increased which implies a larger median grain size diameter in research of ali et al 2012 overland flow velocity is lower with the median grain size increasing from 0 23 to 1 02 mm but the non significant effect of slope on overland flow velocity by ali et al 2012 does not agree with the conclusions of this research the possible reason is that the well sorted non cohesive sand particles used by ali et al 2012 are quite different from the loess sand mixtures in terms of grain size distribution another possible reason is the gentle slopes 3 10 from which velocity data are derived by ali et al 2012 are quite different from the slope degrees 5 25 in this experiment the estimated velocities over sandified loess surface range from 0 18 to 0 96 m s 1 which is similar to the velocity reported by huang et al 2018 the research by huang et al 2018 also indicates a significant dependency of overland flow velocity on slope degree which agrees with results suggested by eq 9 4 2 increased in flow velocity over sandified and non sandified loess slopes velocities of water flow on sand incorporated rill surface were significantly higher than those on loess soil slope linear regression showed that flow velocities increased with decreased incorporated sand contents or decreased with increase in sand content but loess soil slope without sand incorporation maintained the lowest rill velocities as shown in fig 13 flow velocities on loess slopes by ban et al 2017 were plotted in fig 13 against datasets over sand incorporated loess slopes for comparing purposes linear regression parameters of 1 69 1 54 and 1 30 indicated that rill velocities over sandified loess slopes with 10 20 and 50 sand incorporated contents were 1 69 1 54 and 1 30 times of that on bare loess slope respectively increase in flow velocities over sandified loess slopes could be explained by exposure of deposited sand particles in the eroded rill bed in fig 4 and in fig 14 the sand incorporated soil rills were eroded by concentrated water flow the finer soil particles were selectively eroded by the water flow the coarse sand particle fraction was remained seen in fig 14 with erosion impacts increasing more fine soil particles was eroded and delivered by water flow more sand particles deposited or exposed at the surface of the soil slope fig 14 the sand layer armored slope surface to make it even more difficult to be eroded or scoured water flow tended to erode the surface soil materials from a wider area so that the rill spread wider fig 14 and smoother as a result there were not many headcuts along the rill as in fig 1 exposure of sand particles at the soil surface may increase frictional force component that can result in reduction in flow velocity as indicated by eq 9 but less occurrence of headcuts in the rill reduced local energy consumption by waterfalls better and straight rill morphology is beneficial for water flow to increase its velocity all these seem explain the reasons that sandified soil slope promote higher flow velocity and higher sand content with higher friction to water flow reduces the magnitude of increase in water flow velocity the armoring effect of sand particles on eroding surface was consistent the results by blom et al 2008 in which vertical winnowing resulted a selectively removement of fine particles and left a subsurface layer material richer in fine particles for interrill erosion on slope surface which was incorporated with coarse textured particles the process of soil armoring by selective removal of finer particles was shown to reduce soil loss by cochrane et al 2019 and the lower energy consumption by reduced soil loss tended to accelerated water flow velocity ali et al 2012 willgoose and sharmeen 2006 with sand incorporated into loess soil the mean diameter of eroded materials increased as shown in fig 15 and the probability for concentrated water flow to detach and transport large particles increased rill flow energy was preferentially consumed through sediment particle detachment and transportation instead of increasing flow velocity ali et al 2012 the gravitational momentum transferred to sediment transportation rather than flow acceleration would increase with increasing sand content moreover decreased flow velocities with increased sand content were reasonable 5 conclusion land degradation caused by aeolian sand incorporation into farmland soil in arid and semi arid areas poses a great threat to sustainable ecosystem and catchment management with fine soil particles detached and coarse aeolian sand deposited and incorporated into plough layer soil along tillage soil particle size distributions are progressively dominated by coarse particle fractions by which sedimentary conditions of rill erosion are altered on sandified slope surface with different incorporated sand contents salt tracing processes with analytical solute transport method for shallow flow velocity measurement was influenced by water tracer retention in the soil and sand mixture layer and therefore can not give reasonable estimates of flow velocities by comparing model results of whole perfect measured processes with those of partial perfect measured processes analytical solute transport model was testified to give accurate velocity measurements when solute conductivity data in the recessing limb were omitted from whole dataset and was later used in bias measured transport processes with lag data points influenced by tracer retention to be omitted the analytical solute transport model was first applied on sandified soil flumes and estimated rill flow velocities well modelling results showed that rill flow velocities were positively correlated with flow rates and slope gradients whereas negatively correlated with incorporated sand contents due to increased coarse particle roughness but rill flow velocities on sand incorporated slopes were higher than those on bare loess slope surface under the same hydraulic conditions possible explanations were that sand particles deposited and accumulated as an armor layer to prevent rill incision and reduce rill surface morphologic variations by less headcuts developed with erosion processes as a key hydraulic parameter of concentrated flow routing and sediment transportation research rill velocities on aeolian incorporated sand slopes give new insight in the understanding of sandified soil erosion dynamics and initial data interpretation would further optimize the strategies of catchment management and ecosystem restoration in wind water compound erosion areas future work with a focus on effect of aeolian sand on soil

5236,ecosystem service approaches to watershed management have grown quickly increasing the importance of understanding the streamflow response to realistic land cover change previous work has investigated the relationship between watershed characteristics and streamflow in catchments around the world but little has focused on systematic relationships between watershed characteristics and streamflow change after land cover restoration to address this gap we simulate streamflow responses to restoring 10 of watershed area from agricultural land to forest and natural pasture in 29 watersheds around the world this change is consistent with that performed in watershed service programs we calculate the change in a broad array of streamflow indices for each site and use a graph connectedness approach to cluster the sites based on the sign of the index value changes we find three primary clusters with distinct responses to restoration permutation tests and effect sizes demonstrate the difference in watershed characteristics and streamflow indices across clusters the low flow intensifying sites have shallower soils and smaller saturated soil volumes after restoration simulated streamflow in these sites increases during relatively dry periods and declines during high flow periods the high flow intensifying sites have larger saturated soil volumes after restoration simulated dry season flow in these sites decreases the high flow enhancing sites have larger soil hydraulic conductivities than the high flow intensifying sites after restoration simulated dry season flow in these sites decreases less than in high flow intensifying sites the soil depth and hydraulic conductivity appear to be the characteristics that determine clusters as clusters are not statistically related to climate watershed location proximity size and shape elevation or pre existing land cover this study provides valuable understanding of land cover restoration and the watershed characteristics that most impact streamflow change keywords watershed services land cover change restoration graph cluster analysis watershed simulation soil depth 1 introduction scientifically supported watershed management requires predicting how changes in land cover will affect a watershed s response to precipitation land cover change may alter watershed discharge and water balance and thus have significant consequences for cities agriculture and the environment bennett and ruef 2016 damania et al 2017 however hydrologic science has not identified clear and simple rules and hydrologic understanding to predict the impact of land cover change on streamflow in many important contexts dennedy frank et al 2016 dennedy frank and gorelick 2019 guswa et al 2014 hamel et al 2017 site specific models can estimate the hydrologic response to land cover changes khoi and suetsugi 2014a b piniewski et al 2014 strauch and volk 2013 but that approach is not easily extended to regions where data scientific capacity and funding are limited bremer et al 2016 daily et al 2009 guswa et al 2014 naeem et al 2015 scientifically supported watershed management is becoming particularly important as ecosystem services become a major conservation driver and watershed services are widely recognized bennett and ruef 2016 bremer et al 2016 vogl et al 2016b vogl et al 2017 it is noteworthy that watershed service investments have often occurred opportunistically rather than by targeting areas where they provide the most value for example early water funds in colombia and ecuador have led to further such funds in brazil and mexico but only recently has work has tried to assess where such investments could provide the most benefit to people chaplin kramer et al 2019 dennedy frank and gorelick 2019 conservation planners and water managers would benefit from better tools to understand and quantify how watershed characteristics affect streamflow responses to land cover change there is a pressing need for watershed service analyses that can support decisions about restoring land cover to conditions with less human impact by reliably estimating the consequent changes in hydrologic behavior even simple rules about the effects of land cover change could help target more in depth analyses for example suppose land cover restoration decreases baseflow in sites where the warm and wet season are out of phase and increases baseflow where these seasons are in phase then restoration to enhance dry season flow could be targeted to sites where the seasons are in phase these would serve the same role as the indicators of hydrologic alteration have for many ecological stream integrity analyses kennen et al 2007 richter et al 1996 such analyses and rules are needed particularly in arid and tropical regimes where watershed services management approaches have seen the strongest adoption bremer et al 2016 lacc tnc 2013 vogl et al 2016b these needs are not well addressed by classic hydrologic approaches to understanding watershed behavior that focus on 1 predicting the discharge response to precipitation often without historical gauge records brauman 2015 carrillo et al 2011 laaha et al 2013 sawicz et al 2011 and 2 temperate and cold climates duan et al 2006 newman et al 2014 2015 peel et al 2000 2010 we present an analysis of predicted streamflow change after restoring land cover to pre development conditions in 29 sites around the world site hydrologic response to simulated restoration is represented by the percent change in a broad set of streamflow indices and a graph connectedness approach is employed to identify similarities and differences in hydrologic responses across sites finally we discuss how the identified responses compare with those seen in paired catchment and catchment classification studies although quantifying the effects of land cover change on streamflow is an important topic to science and society previous hydrologic studies have not systematically studied such effects scientists have used computational hydrologic models in a wide variety of cases the models have varied in complexity from very simple hamel et al 2017 zhang et al 2001 to very complex condon and maxwell 2017 moffett et al 2012 such models have been run at spatial scales from local moffett et al 2012 van liew et al 2007 to global döll et al 2016 wada et al 2011 and at temporal scales from sub daily to multi annual these models have assessed land cover change with different levels of sophistication from inspection of scenarios to trend analysis based on machine learning and cellular automata fisher et al 2017 kepner et al 2012 khoi and suetsugi 2014b kim et al 2017 logsdon and chaubey 2013 similarly models have integrated important socioeconomic elements with different levels of complexity from deeply interdisciplinary studies to watershed modeling exercises akhavan et al 2010 suliman et al 2015 yoon 2017 many hydrologic models have been effectively used for watershed management and planning by reflecting human impacts on watersheds ficklin et al 2013 kroeger et al 2019 zhang et al 2015 but to our knowledge no work has synthesized the results across such studies in particular previous hydrologic simulations have not systematically identified the streamflow response to land cover change though some studies have found important site specific effects of land cover on local water resources khoi and suetsugi 2014b kroeger et al 2017 vogl et al 2016b many land management studies rely on computational hydrologic simulators to estimate the effects of land cover change but they 1 are strongly biased towards the cold and temperate watersheds of the united states and europe e g in gassman et al 2007 and 2 sometimes suffer from sufficient inaccuracies or lack of robustness to make their use in decision making questionable e g zaherpour et al 2018 the computational hydrologic simulators used by academic researchers are more complex and more advanced kollet and maxwell 2006 strauch and volk 2013 therrien and sudicky 1996 white et al 2011 but are not easily applied for management they have not led the way to simpler broadly pertinent rules that describe the hydrologic impacts of land cover change the alternative catchment classification approach wagener et al 2007 has similarly failed to find strong relationships between streamflow and watershed characteristics and has often found that such relationships cannot be extended beyond the study region hamel et al 2017 this approach seeks to statistically relate runoff characteristics with watershed characteristics across a broad range of sites e g carrillo et al 2011 laaha et al 2013 sawicz et al 2011 smith et al 2018 in doing so it does not isolate the streamflow change after shifts in land cover instead looking solely at the relationships between land cover and many other variables and streamflow before any shift these studies too are generally biased towards temperate and cold climates this work addresses the gap between readily applicable rules needed by land managers and the computationally intensive simulations or sophisticated statistical investigations performed in research settings that have not previously been simplified or generalized our effort seeks to use moderately complex hydrologic simulations in many sites to assess the effects of land cover restoration on streamflow change for a broad suite of environments a novel approach in the hydrology literature this differs from the detailed computational simulations by investigating many sites with a simpler model it differs from the catchment classification approach in focusing on streamflow change after land cover shifts and isolating these shifts in a more detailed analysis of fewer catchments instead by comparing changes across many sites to understand hydrologic drivers our approach combines the ability of hydrologic simulation to isolate the effects of land cover shifts on streamflow change and the discriminatory power through comparison of catchment classification we search for simple rules that describe the effects of land cover restoration in these well controlled simulations to address this long standing challenge 2 methods we present a systematic study of the effects of land cover restoration on hydrologic behavior changes at 29 sites from around the world and across climatic zones from the peer reviewed literature we collected site specific watershed models obtaining data and rigorously recalibrating the simulations to improve their performance we simulated all site models under consistent and locally realistic scenarios of restoring pre development land cover we then calculated the percent change in 141 streamflow indices describing different aspects of the hydrograph for each site a graph based clustering algorithm was used to group sites with similar hydrologic responses based on a minimally correlated subset of streamflow indices we call our algorithm a graph connectedness approach permutation tests were then used to relate these clusters to the pre restoration streamflow indices and watershed characteristics 2 1 hydrologic modeling the selected watersheds were simulated using the soil and water assessment tool swat a model of moderate complexity often used to quantify the hydrologic impacts of land cover change arnold et al 1998 de bressiani et al 2015 gassman et al 2007 swat represents many hydrologic processes including splitting runoff and infiltration flow through many soil layers and an unsaturated zone and baseflow from a shallow aquifer as well as resource responsive plant growth and time varying plant water use to do so swat includes characteristics such as the depth hydraulic conductivity and porosity of up to 10 soil layers a recession constant for a shallow aquifer and plant growth and leaf area parameters our approach integrates local high resolution data and hydrologic understanding from carefully constructed site models across the globe in a suite of geographic and climatic zones swat was selected for this study because its widespread use for water resource and ecosystem service assessment in many contexts francesconi et al 2016 gassman et al 2007 indicates acceptance by the water and land management communities and allows the collection of consistent simulations from basins around the globe swat includes two key features to investigate land cover change effects explicit land cover representation that can be easily changed arnold et al 2010 and a phenological vegetation model that responds to both climate and nutrient stresses williams 1995 the watersheds in this study cover a broad range of land cover types pedologic environments and management contexts this novel use of existing local high resolution site models represents a middle way between poorly constrained global hydrologic models döll et al 2016 wada et al 2011 and site specific assessments that provide strong conceptual understanding and predictive power for a single site vogl et al 2016b yoon 2017 the watershed simulations allow us to isolate the impacts of land cover change on streamflow while accounting for differences in climate soil properties and topography the site models were obtained from the authors of peer reviewed studies after selecting a subset from over 2500 site studies texas a m usda ars 2017 based on a number of key characteristics discussed here sites were chosen such that they cover köppen geiger climate zones peel et al 2007 to avoid oversampling temperate and cold sites in the us and europe the watersheds lie on 6 continents and in 11 second order köppen geiger climate zones fig 1 other simulation criteria included an area between 50 km2 and 20 000 km2 and at least five years of calibration data a nash sutcliffe efficiency nash and sutcliffe 1970 of 0 5 for daily discharge data or 0 7 for monthly discharge data and a bias of 20 accounting for groundwater abstraction and known point sources ensured satisfactory model performance per moriasi et al 2007 most sites had significantly more than 5 years of data and only 3 sites had solely monthly data with the others having daily calibration data available from the authors or publicly accessible government sites table 1 provides details about the site models for references see supplement si 1 all watershed site models were rebuilt in swat2012 rev 637 to eliminate differences in model structure calibration was performed via a split sample approach with approximately half of the data being used for simulation training and the other half reserved for verification re calibrations typically reduced over parameterization of spatially variable parameter values while conforming to the hydrologic processes formulated by the original site model authors for sites for which calibration was performed on a monthly basis but for which daily data were available the daily calibration statistics were checked and these models were re calibrated to improve daily statistics more detail on the calibration statistics can be found in supplement si 1 we refer to these re calibrated models as baseline scenarios throughout the paper 2 2 restoration scenario representation land cover change was simulated as restoration of 10 of the watershed area to pre development conditions pre development land cover was selected based on known ecological suitability in the watershed from current land cover and previous estimates ramankutty and foley 1999 land cover change was restricted to increasing one land cover and decreasing a second see supplement si 2 for details if 10 of the land cover could not be changed index value changes were linearly extrapolated to 10 from a baseline of 0 index change for 0 land cover change the sites were required to have at least 4 land cover change to avoid over interpreting this extrapolation 2 3 clustering with streamflow indices we assess the similarities and differences between the watersheds responses to restoration using a graph connectedness approach to define clusters of watersheds that respond in similar ways to do so we build a graph that has watersheds as the nodes and defines these nodes distance from each other by the similarity of the change in numerous streamflow index values after simulated restoration in the resulting graph watersheds that are close to each other have a similar response to restoration and those far from each other different responses to restoration that graph connectedness approach is detailed in the following subsections first we define a broad set of streamflow indices and calculate the index value changes between baseline and restoration scenarios we develop measures to reduce the effect of a small number of anomalously large index value changes second we use a dimension reduction approach to select a set of minimally correlated index value changes that still have clear meanings finally we construct a graph such that the watersheds with more similar responses to restoration are closer to each other we designate groups of close watersheds a cluster 2 3 1 streamflow indices a set of 141 streamflow indices is gathered from published literature that investigated changes in river discharge tested the similarities and differences in behavior across catchments and assessed local water resources for planning purposes these indices include many of those from the indicators of hydrologic alteration richter et al 1997 richter et al 1996 and extensions to that work gao et al 2009 kennen et al 2007 olden and poff 2003 catchment classification work carrillo et al 2011 sawicz et al 2011 and current guidance that summarizes classic water resources approaches used by the usgs and wmo hortness 2006 martin et al 2016 risley et al 2008 world meteorological organization 2009 ziegeweid et al 2015 these indices are selected because of their use in water resource planning and in describing flow differences across watersheds a full list of the indices and their literature citations are presented in supplement si 3 for each site the percent change in each of the 141 streamflow index values is calculated after calculating the index for both the existing land cover and the pre development land cover restoration scenario the percent change normalizes the effects of total discharge magnitude and watershed size and it readily permits statistical tests and other simple analyses percent change is defined such that an increase in the index value results in a positive percent change and vice versa preliminary analyses with these index value changes found that a small percentage 0 5 of them had anomalously large errors that dominated regression or dimension reduction approaches we address this by adopting two measures that remove the effect of these anomalously large changes in index values to build the graph discussed presently we use the index sign change i s which simply applies the sign function to the index value change with a tolerance that sets very small values to 0 see supplement si 4 hereafter we simply reference the sign of the index value change for statistical tests of the indices across different clusters in the graph we use a truncated index value change i t i t simply takes the percent change of the index value and truncates it to 25 so that all index values are within the range 25 25 this approach reduces the magnitude of the 0 5 of anomalously large index value changes to reduce their influence 2 3 2 selecting a minimally correlated subset of indices many of the streamflow index values and their changes are strongly correlated to one another gao et al 2009 olden and poff 2003 therefore we use principle component analysis pca pedregosa et al 2011 on the index sign change i s to avoid overweighting components in the graph analysis components were selected to cover 99 of the variance to ensure that important components are not ignored the principal components and their major contributing indices are shown in si 5 because the pca components are linear combinations of the streamflow index value changes these components are difficult to interpret thus they do not provide useful guidance for predicting hydrologic response to land cover change to address the challenge of interpreting the pca components we use varimax rotation varimax rotation finds the set of streamflow index value changes that maximizes the sum of the variance of the square loadings that is it seeks to have each component represented by one or a few very large loadings from streamflow index value changes and no loadings from other streamflow index value changes these strongly loaded streamflow index value changes of the same dimension as the pca represent the set of index value changes most similar to the purely orthogonal pca components varimax rotation is performed with python s factor rotation package van der schans 2015 these index value changes represent the same variance in the system as the pca components but provide a clearer interpretation at the cost of increased correlation between the indices here these reduced dimension index value changes are used to construct the graph the 26 streamflow index value changes selected through pca and varimax rotation are shown in table 2 along with basic definitions and their primary source we group them into 6 families low flow monthly flow monthly flow variance integrated signal daily flow and high flow the low flow family describes the changes in magnitude frequency duration and variability of low flows low flow here is defined alternately as all flows less than 1 the 75 exceedance flow 2 the minimum 30 day average flow or 3 the minimum 7 day average flow in addition a digital filter is run to estimate the baseflow recession arnold and allen 1999 and the resulting change in recession constant is included the monthly flow family describes the change in maximum or minimum flow in a given month the monthly flow variance family describes the changes in variability in the monthly average flow for a given month or the variance among monthly flows the integrated signal family brings together multiple years of flow through the flow duration curve the daily flow family deals with either the daily change of flow or with particular days when criteria are met the high flow family describes the changes in the magnitude timing and duration of high flow periods defined as larger than 3 or 7 median 25 exceedance or the average maximum daily or 7 day flow 2 3 3 clustering approach we use a graph connectedness approach with a spring based visualization kamada and kawai 1989 to cluster and investigate the similarities and differences among the watersheds streamflow changes after simulated land cover restoration the approach is then extended to help identify watershed characteristics that cluster in the same manner as the changes in streamflow index values and thus are likely related to the hydrologic responses to land cover change although graph based clustering has been used in other fields e g hartuv et al 2000 to our knowledge our application of the graph connectedness approach in searching for watershed similarity is novel as shown it yields useful multi dimensional similarity in clusters based on relatively few assumptions we discuss the graph connectedness approach to clustering here and statistical tests of features correlation with the graph based clusters in section 2 4 note that the term features as used here refers to both streamflow index values not their changes and watershed characteristics the graph connectedness approach builds a network with each site serving as a node the distance between the nodes is set by a measure of similarity between the change in streamflow index values at each site and implemented as a graph link sometime referred to as an edge in other applications between the nodes with a length proportional to this distance we define the similarity as l 1 r where r is the correlation of the signs of the observed change in streamflow index values discussed presently thus smaller distances represent more similar sites and larger distances less similar sites the graph shape is determined by a model that minimizes the energy in a spring kamada and kawai 1989 this model is analogous to a physical system in which springs with different resting lengths are linked between nodes with the energy in each spring increasing as the square of the link s length away from the resting 0 energy distance consistent with a simple spring obeying hooke s law once all the springs are linked the system is set free and it eventually comes to rest in a minimum energy state hagberg et al 2010 this enables easy visualization of the relationships between nodes and the delineation of clusters the graph is built using the sign correlation as the similarity measure this is the broadest measure of index value change similarity we could determine and was selected to reduce the effects of the 0 5 of anomalously large index value changes that otherwise dominate measures of similarity the sign correlation simply represents the percentage of streamflow indices showing value changes of the same sign between two sites under land cover restoration the sign correlations can take any value between 0 no index value changes have the same sign between two sites to 100 all index value changes have the same sign between the two sites three signs are possible for each index value change 1 is an increase 1 is a decrease and 0 is no change see si 4 for details we assume that sites that have the same direction of change of an index value are more likely to behave similarly a graph with links between each pair of nodes would include near random connections between many sites which we address by including only links that connect sites more strongly weakly than would be expected by chance to determine the chance level of connection between the streamflow index value changes for two watersheds we develop a simple null model with the same structure discussed in supplement si 6 2 4 permutation tests and effect size to identify watershed characteristics related to clusters permutation tests are employed to investigate which features might be associated with which clusters permutation tests are a non parametric statistical test good 2005 consider a group of watershed feature metric values v split into two clusters with sizes c 1 and c 2 the difference between the mean value of the v in each cluster is calculated this difference is then checked against clusters of the same size created from permutations of all of the values v from a large number of permutations we estimate the probability that the mean feature values are statistically distinct across the observed clusters we use the null hypothesis that the means of the features in the two clusters are the same the test provides a probability that an observed difference of feature metric values across clusters is statistically significant suggesting that the feature is related to the clusters permutation tests are run on three different features against the clusters determined through the graph connectedness approach 1 the changes in streamflow index values as determined previously the signs of which are used to build the graph 2 the watershed characteristics and 3 the streamflow index values based on pre restoration land cover permutation tests on the changes in streamflow index values help determine which indices drive the clustering the python package permute stark et al 2015 is used for permutation tests the effect sizes of the feature differences across clusters indicate the degree to which clusters are distinguishable by that feature distinguishable features likely contribute to watershed responses to land cover change we use cohen s d a standard effect size metric welkowitz et al 2012 that reflects the difference in the means of the clusters 1 d x 1 x 2 s with x c the mean of cluster c and s the pooled standard deviation between the two clusters s is defined as 2 s m 1 1 s 1 2 m 2 1 s 2 2 m 1 m 2 2 with m c the number of members of cluster c and s c 2 the sample variance for cluster c we search for effect sizes greater than 1 so that the means differ by more than the pooled standard deviation which we expect indicates that such a feature is substantially different and thus distinct across the clusters this indicates that the feature likely contributes to differences in hydrologic behavior cohen s d is similar to the inverse of the coefficient of variation seeking to make sure that the difference in means is large relative to the standard deviation 3 results we first discuss the graph and define the three identified clusters of watershed response to land cover change the low flow intensifying sites the high flow intensifying sites and the high flow enhancing sites next permutation test results are presented for three categories a changes in streamflow index values after land cover change b watershed characteristics and c pre restoration streamflow index values in the low flow intensifying sites simulated streamflow increases during low flow periods and decreases during high flow periods the opposite occurs in the high flow intensifying sites the low flow intensifying sites contain shallower soils and smaller soil water volumes than the high flow intensifying sites the high flow enhancing sites have soil depths similar to the high flow intensifying sites but also larger hydraulic conductivity as a result the high flow enhancing sites change in the same direction as the high flow intensifying sites but with a smaller magnitude finally we explain additional features of different clusters of watersheds for which streamflow responds similarly to land cover change 3 1 graph connectedness clustering 3 1 1 sign correlation of restoration scenario shows three coherent clusters fig 2 shows the graph built from the sign correlation of the changes in streamflow index values for 10 restoration of pre development land there are three primary clusters shown as red brown and yellow in addition there are small clusters consisting of 2 or 3 sites and several sites that are not in a cluster with weak similarity to any other site which we designate in dark grey shades and light grey shades respectively we define the three primary clusters apparent by visual inspection fig 2 low flow intensifying high flow enhancing and high flow intensifying the clusters are named after the behavior of related sets of indices as shown in fig 3 and discussed below the clusters and graph shape are determined by the sign correlations noted next to the links in fig 2 as discussed in the methods clusters were identified as those watersheds showing sign correlations with a significance level α of 0 05 in the random null model this corresponds to a sign correlation of 61 watersheds with sign correlations that were all 61 were set aside as outside the three primary clusters see supplement si 6 there are 7 9 and 5 sites in the low flow intensifying high flow intensifying and high flow enhancing clusters respectively the graph as shown uses a stronger significance level α 0 025 for clarity links stronger than the random null model with significance level α 0 025 a sign correlation 63 are shown as solid black lines links with a sign correlation 63 but still included per the methods section criteria are noted with dotted grey lines in addition sign correlations weaker than the random null model with α 0 025 22 push away dissimilar watersheds in the graph but are not shown for clarity they are included in supplement si 7 which lists all sign correlations used to construct the graph sites falling in between clusters that met the 61 sign correlation threshold were assigned to only one of the clusters based on their highest sign correlation to all members of the competing clusters we identified the yass river catchment in australia as a member of the low flow intensifying cluster based on its status as a hub with the strongest connection for many sites the reda catchment in poland was identified as a member of the high flow intensifying cluster based on its links to two high flow intensifying cluster members of about the same strength as its connection to the yass the nam ou in laos was identified as a member of the high flow intensifying cluster because of its stronger link to the po ko in vietnam than the shibetsu in japan the shibetsu was selected as a member of the high flow enhancing cluster because of its stronger connections to the upper upatoi in georgia us and the s fork of the cour d alene in idaho us 3 1 2 cluster similarities and membership the differences in the clusters are fundamentally multivariate and there is no single streamflow index that individually defines them however there are a number of consistent streamflow responses that vary across clusters table 3 shows the mean change of a set of streamflow index values that are statistically different across clusters fig 3 shows that the watersheds in each cluster have different responses to land cover change the figure shows the rank order of values for a subset 8 of 10 of the indices from table 3 including the median flow value as radar plots the signs of the index values were reversed for low flow occurrence and monthly flow variability because a reduction in these index values leads to increasing low flow the values were ranked from smallest to largest as 1 to 3 the outer rim of the radar plot axis is 3 and the center point is 1 ties resulted in repeated rank values the baseflow recession and high flow volume were omitted because they are unintuitive and do not change the results the median flow is one of the 141 pre dimension reduction indices and was included because it provides a simple measure of central tendency comparing the pre restoration simulation to the restoration land cover simulation the low flow intensifying cluster generally sees a rise in the flow during relatively dry and average periods and a decline in the discharge during high flow periods this is a regulating behavior that is typically desired for watershed services shifting discharge from high flow periods to low flow periods both to reduce the chance of flood damage and to provide consistent dry season flow this can be seen clearly by the largest rank in low flow index value changes including low flow occurrence and increase in low summer flow and the smallest rank in high flow indices such as high flow seasonality the high flow intensifying cluster in contrast sees a decrease in discharge during low flow periods and an increase in the relative high flows as well as flow variability the high flow value changes show a large rank including the largest rank for high flow magnitude and high flow seasonality and the second largest for pre peak flow this cluster generally has the smallest rank in the low flow and intermediate flow indices including 10 more low flow occurrences and 8 less low summer flow this reduction in low flow is sometimes a concern when considering the hydrologic effects of restoration the high flow enhancing cluster sees similar responses to the high flow intensifying cluster but the magnitudes are smaller so the enhancing cluster generally has the middle rank it does have the largest value change for pre peak flow and is the only cluster that has a positive mean value change for that index however it has the middle rank for high flow magnitude high flow seasonality and low flow occurrence 3 1 3 indices across clusters the clusters are further distinguishable by their marked differences in mean value changes of specific indices first consider the high flow magnitude response to land cover restoration the low flow intensifying cluster has a decline of 6 of the high flow magnitude see table 3 which is statistically different α 0 05 from the high flow intensifying and high flow enhancing clusters that show rises of 5 and 1 respectively the permutation tests show particularly low p values p 0 0025 see methods section for null hypothesis as well as effect sizes of 2 4 and 1 7 for the low flow intensifying cluster compared to the high flow intensifying and high flow enhancing clusters since the difference between the rise in the high flow magnitude in the high flow intensifying and low flow intensifying clusters is more than twice their variability we argue they represent fundamentally different responses second changes in the average flow also highlights the hydrologic response differences of the three clusters resulting from restoration land cover change consider the median flow or 50 exceedance flow of the sites within each cluster from the list of 141 indices the median flow value in the high flow intensifying and high flow enhancing clusters show a decline of 6 and 2 respectively while the low flow intensifying cluster shows a rise of 4 the high flow intensifying and low flow intensifying clusters have statistically different means with p 0 0003 and the high flow intensifying and high flow enhancing clusters have different means with p 0 008 these clusters have effect sizes of 1 7 and 1 5 respectively it is noteworthy that the change in median flow is found to be statistically different across the three clusters but was not selected by the dimension reduction approach third index value changes reflecting land cover restoration impact on low flow show statistically significant differences across clusters see table 3 specifically comparing to the pre restoration case the low flow intensifying cluster has reduced mean of low flow occurrences rather than the increased mean of low flow occurrences in the high flow intensifying cluster with p value 0 0026 and effect size 1 9 the high flow enhancing cluster has a mean change that differs from the high flow intensifying cluster with a p value of 0 03 and effect size of 1 2 together the differences and similarities across clusters reveal a consistent set of themes as shown in fig 3 in the low flow intensifying cluster the high flow decreases while in the high flow intensifying cluster and less so in the high flow enhancing cluster high flow increases relative to the median flow in each watershed in the low flow intensifying cluster watersheds the water that went to high flow in the pre restoration land cover case is instead stored and released during low flow periods in the high flow intensifying and high flow enhancing clusters restoration affects the modeled flow in one of two ways 1 the water that comprises low flow and average flow are each diminished because that water is routed more quickly to the high flow regime and 2 greater evapotranspiration lowers both high flow and median flow in both of these cases there is a higher proportion of high flow to median flow 3 2 soil characteristics and slope of flow duration curve are strongly related to clusters we explored which watershed characteristics and streamflow index values based on pre restoration land cover are most strongly related to the three clusters as determined by permutation tests the most obvious characteristics such as geographic location and climate zone do not show strong relationships to the clusters as shown in fig 1 for example the high flow intensifying cluster includes sites from vietnam iran brazil poland and indiana the high flow enhancing cluster includes sites from brazil japan idaho and georgia usa fig 4 shows the values of watershed characteristics and streamflow indices for each site while table 4 presents the results of statistical tests and effect sizes in each section of fig 4 each column represents a site and the columns are grouped according to the clusters each box shows the value of the feature defined on the left at that site through both color and the printing of the value in the box the color scale on the right side of the boxes corresponds to these values these color scales are sometimes truncated to better represent the distribution table 4 provides the permutation test p value and the effect size across clusters 3 2 1 importance of soil depth hydraulic conductivity and water content soil characteristics are the only watershed characteristics that predict cluster membership fig 4a the soil depth and saturated water content are both significantly smaller α 0 05 in the low flow intensifying sites than in either the high flow intensifying or high flow enhancing sites with effect sizes greater than 1 these results show that in our simulations high flow is reduced and low flow increased in only those sites that have relatively thin soils which might be improved through restoration of land cover soil clay percentage and sand percentage differ statistically α 0 05 between the low flow intensifying and high flow enhancing clusters the high flow enhancing cluster has sandier soils and the low flow intensifying cluster has more clay rich soils this suggests that in our simulations increasing infiltration in low flow intensifying cluster sites may lead to a diminution in high flow and rise in low flow under land cover restoration these soil characteristics are not independent but all are presented here to show the differences and similarities soil hydraulic conductivity in contrast is significantly smaller α 0 05 in the high flow intensifying cluster than the high flow enhancing cluster and is the only physical characteristic that separates these two clusters this suggests that the primary difference between the sets of watersheds in their respective clusters is simply how fast water moves through the soils in the high flow enhancing cluster sites the water moves quickly through the soil and recharges groundwater so the response to land cover restoration is lower than that in the high flow intensifying cluster sites the high flow intensifying cluster sites in contrast have slower flow through the soil which leads to a larger low flow decrease and smaller high flow decline as the restored land cover can transpire water that has a longer soil residence time many other characteristics were tested including watershed shape elevation and slope climate and pre restoration land cover but none of these showed a significant difference among the clusters 3 2 2 hydrologic behavior under pre restoration land cover shows strong relationships to restored watershed response in addition to the watershed characteristics we also analyzed pre restoration streamflow index values to determine which indices might correlate with the graph based clusters and thus provide useful information about the similarities and differences in watershed behavior across these clusters fig 4b and c show the pre restoration streamflow index values arranged by cluster and table 4 the results of permutation tests and effect sizes across the clusters there are significant differences between clusters in the hydrologic response as measured by the flow duration curve duration curve which shows how often flow exceeds any given value and thus serves as an integrated measure of the likelihood of experiencing flow conditions in the long term here we represent the duration curve by the average flow variability technically the concavity index which is the slope of the line connecting the 33 and 66 exceedance daily flows and the slope of the duration curve in the range from 1 to 10 exceedance high flow duration index a high value of average flow variability means that there is large mid range flow variability of the duration curve a duration curve with a large high flow duration index has a smaller number of extremely large events and fewer moderately large events we found that average flow variability in the low flow intensifying cluster is significantly smaller than in the high flow intensifying cluster fig 4b table 4b there are 11 440 possible combinations of the 16 average flow variability samples comprised by the seven watersheds in the low flow intensifying cluster and the nine watersheds in the high flow intensifying cluster we found a perfect sorting with the high flow intensifying cluster having the largest values of average flow variability and the low flow intensifying cluster having the smallest values and an effect size of 2 6 between the two this perfect sorting is one of the two most extreme cases of the 11 440 combinations the average flow variability value does not have the same perfect sorting between the low flow intensifying and high flow enhancing clusters but the difference is still significant α 0 05 with effect size 1 8 regarding the high flow duration index there were extreme differences between the low flow intensifying and high flow intensifying clusters again with perfect sorting the effect size for the high flow duration index is slightly smaller than that for the average flow variability but it is still above 2 the low flow intensifying cluster s steeper slope indicates that the streams are flashier as there is a larger range between the few extreme flows and the moderately large events the high flow intensifying cluster s smaller slope indicates more consistent values between extreme and more common high flows or less flashy behavior the low flow intensifying and high flow enhancing clusters also show a significant difference α 0 05 in this high flow duration index and have an effect size of 1 5 but lack perfect sorting further results also suggests that the low flow intensifying cluster sites are predominately governed by a few very large flows and have more constant low flows during the rest of the year when compared to the high flow intensifying and high flow enhancing cluster sites specifically we found that mean daily flow median daily flow index values have a structure similar to that of the high flow duration index values with the low flow intensifying cluster sites having large values and the high flow intensifying and high flow enhancing cluster sites having smaller values the difference is significant α 0 05 but the effect size is only 1 a few additional indices that describe flow variability show distinctions between the clusters though not as strongly as duration curve indices which describe long term integrated watershed response these daily flow variability indices are also shown in fig 4b and table 4b the coefficient of variation cv of daily flow has perfect sorting between the low flow intensifying and high flow intensifying clusters with an effect size of 1 7 the low flow intensifying cluster watersheds have a larger cv only one site in the high flow enhancing cluster has a cv of daily flow value larger than any site in the low flow intensifying cluster the low flow intensifying cluster sites also have a more variable number of flow reversals across years than the high flow intensifying cluster sites with effect size 1 though they are not distinguishable from the high flow enhancing cluster sites due to one highly variable site in the latter cluster the cv in the rate of flow change during periods of increasing flow is larger in the low flow intensifying cluster watersheds than the high flow intensifying cluster watersheds finally the median flow change for consecutive days of increasing flow is significantly larger in the high flow enhancing cluster than the high flow intensifying cluster this suggests that discharge increases more quickly in the watersheds in the high flow enhancing cluster than those in the high flow intensifying cluster consistent with the former cluster s larger hydraulic conductivity the low flow intensifying cluster has smaller and relatively more variable pre restoration low flow than the high flow enhancing or high flow intensifying clusters as shown in fig 4c and table 4c the baseflow fraction index value is larger in both the high flow intensifying and the high flow enhancing clusters than in the low flow intensifying cluster α 0 05 with effect sizes 2 2 and 1 5 respectively the high flow intensifying cluster only has one out of nine values that are lower than any in the low flow intensifying cluster associated with its lower baseflow fraction the low flow intensifying cluster has a larger variance in the daily baseflow estimated using a digital filter arnold and allen 1999 and a larger cv in the date of the annual minimum flow supplement si 8 shows that there is a similar difference across clusters in a number of high flow index values calculated for the pre restoration simulation other indices did not show significant differences between clusters these similarities may also be important for interpreting the similarities and differences in watershed response to land cover change and are discussed in supplement si 9 these indices include the average flow change during periods of rising flow and the slope of the duration curve from 75 to 99 exceedance 4 discussion 4 1 indicators of watershed response we employed 29 hydrologic site models to investigate the change in a variety of streamflow indices after simulated land cover restoration these results provide useful information about the types of watersheds where watershed service investments in land cover restoration might provide valuable water resource improvements and where they might instead disrupt local flow benefits in particular sites in the low flow intensifying cluster display the behavior desired from watershed service investment for land cover restoration spreading stream discharge over time even if the penalty is a loss of annual water yield sites in the high flow intensifying cluster instead see a decline in water yield with a particularly notable decline during low flow periods sites in the high flow enhancing cluster show the same basic responses as those in the high flow intensifying cluster but less so to the point that declines in water yield and particularly low flow might not be noticed our analysis is distinct from the spatial targeting of land cover change inside a watershed which has been the focus of other work guswa et al 2014 jackson et al 2013 vogl et al 2016a b instead we investigate the general conditions under which land cover change might provide tangible watershed services 4 1 1 watershed characteristics soil depth saturated water content and hydraulic conductivity have significantly different values across the delineated clusters this suggests that watersheds with relatively thin soils that cannot hold significant amounts of water may be more likely to transfer water from high flow to low flow regimes upon land cover restoration this outcome could be beneficial even though it is likely to also produce a reduction in total water yield among sites with thicker soils and higher saturated water contents those sites with relatively high hydraulic conductivities may be likely to see smaller reductions in low flow and smaller relative increases in high flow as the water can flow quickly through the soil profile and thus is affected less by vegetation in contrast similar sites but having low hydraulic conductivity soils may be likely to see a decrease in low flow as well as a relative rise in high flow representing a significant water resource cost to land cover restoration 4 1 2 flow duration curve the average flow variability and the high flow duration indices based on the flow duration curve for the pre restoration case also showed significant differences across clusters this led us to further investigate the features of the flow duration curves for sites in each cluster in fig 5 we plot the 29 duration curves where flow y axis is normalized by the maximum flow for each site lines are color coded by the clusters identified in fig 2 the inset panel provides a simple summary by displaying the median curves for all sites in each cluster there are 8 sites that are not in the three primary clusters which are colored light grey there is a clear difference in the nature of the duration curves for each cluster the watersheds in the low flow intensifying cluster tend to have much more concave duration curves than those in the high flow intensifying or high flow enhancing clusters as seen in fig 5 this is consistent with the observations above wherein the watersheds with more concave normalized pre restoration duration curves shift more water from the high flow period to low flow periods after restoration in contrast the watersheds with less concave normalized pre restoration duration curves transfer water to low flow periods efficiently before restoration after restoration these watersheds experience increased evapotranspiration and consequently provide less discharge during low flow periods overall those watersheds with stronger variability in flow are more likely to have restoration of pre development land cover increase low flows while those with a smoother distribution of flows are not 4 2 field studies despite significant effort by many hydrologists a clear understanding of the factors that drive the hydrologic response to land cover change remains elusive field studies remain key constraints on such understanding and our results are consistent with a number of field studies however many field studies have focused on land cover changes that are not directly applicable to watershed service investment for several reasons 1 many investigate annual water yield which is not the most relevant measure for most water resource considerations 2 many focus on small scale experimental catchments of 1 1000 ha with extreme land cover change often approaching 100 to achieve statistical power but which are not necessarily realistic for watershed investments that change smaller fractions of larger watersheds with areas in the 100s 1000s km2 3 others address differences in hydrologic response with land cover across catchments but do not provide clear guidance for the response to change and 4 many studies have a strong bias towards temperate and cold climates where most data are available bosch and hewlett 1982 brown et al 2005 2013 carrillo et al 2011 hamel et al 2017 ogden et al 2013 price et al 2011 sahin and hall 1996 sawicz et al 2011 scott and lesch 1997 stednick 1996 wagener et al 2007 whitehead and robinson 1993 yadav et al 2007 the broad paired catchment literature is consistent with our results showing a reduction in annual water yield under afforestation brown et al 2005 farley et al 2005 filoso et al 2017 previous work has suggested that changes in water yield cannot be detected experimentally with changes of 20 of the watershed because of the natural variability bosch and hewlett 1982 stednick 1996 however brown et al 2005 suggest it is still possible to predict the response of smaller land cover changes such prediction is consistent with the small reductions in water yield for almost all sites and in all three clusters that are apparent because the watershed simulations hold all conditions identical except for land cover studies of low flow changes due to land cover change find more variability than those of annual water yield consistent with our results paired catchment studies have found that afforestation decreases low flow farley et al 2005 particularly that forested catchments had 90 exceedance flows that were 10 90 lower than the 90 exceedance flows of non forested catchments brown et al 2013 scott and lesch 1997 this result is similar to that from our high flow intensifying and high flow enhancing clusters though stronger because they often represent the watershed response to much larger land cover change than the 10 we simulated other work has found that forested watersheds had larger low flows from 1 to 50 ogden et al 2013 and 6 24 price et al 2011 which could be consistent with our low flow intensifying cluster note that these were not however experimental land cover changes but rather comparisons across paired watersheds with different amounts of forest from previous disturbance price et al 2011 tested the effect of the percent area of colluvium on baseflow in the presence of different amounts of forest cover and found that increased colluvium and forest cover were positively related to increases in baseflow metrics if we assume that increased colluvium corresponds with decreased soil depth this is consistent with our findings that sites with smaller soil depth were in the low flow intensifying cluster the variable low flow effects of land cover are consistent with the distinct and differing direction responses seen in the watersheds in the low flow intensifying versus high flow intensifying clusters however it is not possible to draw robust links between these field studies and our models because of the lack of data on the field study conditions none of the sites in this study have significant fog capture so we do not see the potential increased low flow because of increased water input from forests in these uncommon circumstances bruijnzeel et al 2011 ellison et al 2012 4 3 analysis caveats as a moderate complexity model swat includes structural limitations that may affect the results of this work most importantly swat s hydrologic response units hrus are not fully spatially connected within subbasins the hrus are spatially discontiguous units that connect to the stream and subbasins are connected through the stream network the lack of connectivity may be particularly important for land cover change in riparian zones where tree removal may have large effects on streamflow everson et al 2007 scott 1999 scott et al 2004 our analysis assumed a uniform land cover restoration across the watershed with shifts from a single land cover to another sensitivity analyses assessed the effects of both localized restoration and more complex land cover shifts and showed that the differences were small dennedy frank and gorelick 2019 appendices a 7 a 8 however the lack of full spatial connectivity does mean that riparian zones in particular may not be appropriately sensitive to these changes there was no relationship between the streamflow changes after restoration and either the size or number of either hrus or subbasins across sites 5 conclusions we investigated the similarities and differences of streamflow changes after the restoration of pre development land cover in 29 sites around the world the sites represent a novel database of previously peer reviewed hydrologic models simulated using swat a tool used extensively by the land and water management communities we find three primary clusters sharing common hydrologic responses to restoration 1 low flow intensifying cluster 2 high flow intensifying cluster and 3 high flow enhancing cluster under restoration the low flow intensifying cluster sites show enhanced discharge during low flow periods and a decline in discharge during high flow periods shifting discharge from high flow to low flow periods is typically a desired outcome for watershed services in contrast the high flow intensifying cluster is characterized by sites in which there is a decrease in discharge during low flow periods and an increased variability of discharge in the near average flow regime similarly the high flow enhancing cluster sites exhibit a decrease in discharge during the low flow periods though of smaller magnitude than the high flow intensifying cluster among watershed characteristics soil depth and saturated soil water content show statistically significant differences across these clusters our results suggest that these soil properties may be a primary driver in watershed response to land cover restoration no non soil watershed characteristics showed a statistically significant difference across the three clusters in sites where the soils are relatively thin restoration results in watershed responses that generate a more even temporal distribution of flow which is often desired in contrast where soils are thick and hydraulic conductivity is low there may instead be a loss of watershed service because of the increased opportunity for evapotranspiration soil depth and hydraulic properties serve as aggregate indicators of effects such as land cover climate and source material and may serve as a particularly valuable indicator of coevolution state troch et al 2015 we show that several flow indices particularly those describing attributes of the flow duration curve have statistically significant differences across clusters the average flow variability index and the high flow duration index are most important the flow duration curves for sites in the low flow intensifying cluster are generally more concave than those in the high flow intensifying and high flow enhancing clusters which indicates that under land cover restoration the water in the high flow periods of the low flow intensifying cluster sites is shifted to low flow periods in the high flow intensifying and high flow enhancing clusters land cover restoration does not transfer additional water to low flow instead increasing water loss to evapotranspiration these results provide a key step in the systematic understanding of how land cover shifts change streamflow and watershed services and inform better prediction of sites where restoration will add value as natural capital credit authorship contribution statement p james dennedy frank

5236,ecosystem service approaches to watershed management have grown quickly increasing the importance of understanding the streamflow response to realistic land cover change previous work has investigated the relationship between watershed characteristics and streamflow in catchments around the world but little has focused on systematic relationships between watershed characteristics and streamflow change after land cover restoration to address this gap we simulate streamflow responses to restoring 10 of watershed area from agricultural land to forest and natural pasture in 29 watersheds around the world this change is consistent with that performed in watershed service programs we calculate the change in a broad array of streamflow indices for each site and use a graph connectedness approach to cluster the sites based on the sign of the index value changes we find three primary clusters with distinct responses to restoration permutation tests and effect sizes demonstrate the difference in watershed characteristics and streamflow indices across clusters the low flow intensifying sites have shallower soils and smaller saturated soil volumes after restoration simulated streamflow in these sites increases during relatively dry periods and declines during high flow periods the high flow intensifying sites have larger saturated soil volumes after restoration simulated dry season flow in these sites decreases the high flow enhancing sites have larger soil hydraulic conductivities than the high flow intensifying sites after restoration simulated dry season flow in these sites decreases less than in high flow intensifying sites the soil depth and hydraulic conductivity appear to be the characteristics that determine clusters as clusters are not statistically related to climate watershed location proximity size and shape elevation or pre existing land cover this study provides valuable understanding of land cover restoration and the watershed characteristics that most impact streamflow change keywords watershed services land cover change restoration graph cluster analysis watershed simulation soil depth 1 introduction scientifically supported watershed management requires predicting how changes in land cover will affect a watershed s response to precipitation land cover change may alter watershed discharge and water balance and thus have significant consequences for cities agriculture and the environment bennett and ruef 2016 damania et al 2017 however hydrologic science has not identified clear and simple rules and hydrologic understanding to predict the impact of land cover change on streamflow in many important contexts dennedy frank et al 2016 dennedy frank and gorelick 2019 guswa et al 2014 hamel et al 2017 site specific models can estimate the hydrologic response to land cover changes khoi and suetsugi 2014a b piniewski et al 2014 strauch and volk 2013 but that approach is not easily extended to regions where data scientific capacity and funding are limited bremer et al 2016 daily et al 2009 guswa et al 2014 naeem et al 2015 scientifically supported watershed management is becoming particularly important as ecosystem services become a major conservation driver and watershed services are widely recognized bennett and ruef 2016 bremer et al 2016 vogl et al 2016b vogl et al 2017 it is noteworthy that watershed service investments have often occurred opportunistically rather than by targeting areas where they provide the most value for example early water funds in colombia and ecuador have led to further such funds in brazil and mexico but only recently has work has tried to assess where such investments could provide the most benefit to people chaplin kramer et al 2019 dennedy frank and gorelick 2019 conservation planners and water managers would benefit from better tools to understand and quantify how watershed characteristics affect streamflow responses to land cover change there is a pressing need for watershed service analyses that can support decisions about restoring land cover to conditions with less human impact by reliably estimating the consequent changes in hydrologic behavior even simple rules about the effects of land cover change could help target more in depth analyses for example suppose land cover restoration decreases baseflow in sites where the warm and wet season are out of phase and increases baseflow where these seasons are in phase then restoration to enhance dry season flow could be targeted to sites where the seasons are in phase these would serve the same role as the indicators of hydrologic alteration have for many ecological stream integrity analyses kennen et al 2007 richter et al 1996 such analyses and rules are needed particularly in arid and tropical regimes where watershed services management approaches have seen the strongest adoption bremer et al 2016 lacc tnc 2013 vogl et al 2016b these needs are not well addressed by classic hydrologic approaches to understanding watershed behavior that focus on 1 predicting the discharge response to precipitation often without historical gauge records brauman 2015 carrillo et al 2011 laaha et al 2013 sawicz et al 2011 and 2 temperate and cold climates duan et al 2006 newman et al 2014 2015 peel et al 2000 2010 we present an analysis of predicted streamflow change after restoring land cover to pre development conditions in 29 sites around the world site hydrologic response to simulated restoration is represented by the percent change in a broad set of streamflow indices and a graph connectedness approach is employed to identify similarities and differences in hydrologic responses across sites finally we discuss how the identified responses compare with those seen in paired catchment and catchment classification studies although quantifying the effects of land cover change on streamflow is an important topic to science and society previous hydrologic studies have not systematically studied such effects scientists have used computational hydrologic models in a wide variety of cases the models have varied in complexity from very simple hamel et al 2017 zhang et al 2001 to very complex condon and maxwell 2017 moffett et al 2012 such models have been run at spatial scales from local moffett et al 2012 van liew et al 2007 to global döll et al 2016 wada et al 2011 and at temporal scales from sub daily to multi annual these models have assessed land cover change with different levels of sophistication from inspection of scenarios to trend analysis based on machine learning and cellular automata fisher et al 2017 kepner et al 2012 khoi and suetsugi 2014b kim et al 2017 logsdon and chaubey 2013 similarly models have integrated important socioeconomic elements with different levels of complexity from deeply interdisciplinary studies to watershed modeling exercises akhavan et al 2010 suliman et al 2015 yoon 2017 many hydrologic models have been effectively used for watershed management and planning by reflecting human impacts on watersheds ficklin et al 2013 kroeger et al 2019 zhang et al 2015 but to our knowledge no work has synthesized the results across such studies in particular previous hydrologic simulations have not systematically identified the streamflow response to land cover change though some studies have found important site specific effects of land cover on local water resources khoi and suetsugi 2014b kroeger et al 2017 vogl et al 2016b many land management studies rely on computational hydrologic simulators to estimate the effects of land cover change but they 1 are strongly biased towards the cold and temperate watersheds of the united states and europe e g in gassman et al 2007 and 2 sometimes suffer from sufficient inaccuracies or lack of robustness to make their use in decision making questionable e g zaherpour et al 2018 the computational hydrologic simulators used by academic researchers are more complex and more advanced kollet and maxwell 2006 strauch and volk 2013 therrien and sudicky 1996 white et al 2011 but are not easily applied for management they have not led the way to simpler broadly pertinent rules that describe the hydrologic impacts of land cover change the alternative catchment classification approach wagener et al 2007 has similarly failed to find strong relationships between streamflow and watershed characteristics and has often found that such relationships cannot be extended beyond the study region hamel et al 2017 this approach seeks to statistically relate runoff characteristics with watershed characteristics across a broad range of sites e g carrillo et al 2011 laaha et al 2013 sawicz et al 2011 smith et al 2018 in doing so it does not isolate the streamflow change after shifts in land cover instead looking solely at the relationships between land cover and many other variables and streamflow before any shift these studies too are generally biased towards temperate and cold climates this work addresses the gap between readily applicable rules needed by land managers and the computationally intensive simulations or sophisticated statistical investigations performed in research settings that have not previously been simplified or generalized our effort seeks to use moderately complex hydrologic simulations in many sites to assess the effects of land cover restoration on streamflow change for a broad suite of environments a novel approach in the hydrology literature this differs from the detailed computational simulations by investigating many sites with a simpler model it differs from the catchment classification approach in focusing on streamflow change after land cover shifts and isolating these shifts in a more detailed analysis of fewer catchments instead by comparing changes across many sites to understand hydrologic drivers our approach combines the ability of hydrologic simulation to isolate the effects of land cover shifts on streamflow change and the discriminatory power through comparison of catchment classification we search for simple rules that describe the effects of land cover restoration in these well controlled simulations to address this long standing challenge 2 methods we present a systematic study of the effects of land cover restoration on hydrologic behavior changes at 29 sites from around the world and across climatic zones from the peer reviewed literature we collected site specific watershed models obtaining data and rigorously recalibrating the simulations to improve their performance we simulated all site models under consistent and locally realistic scenarios of restoring pre development land cover we then calculated the percent change in 141 streamflow indices describing different aspects of the hydrograph for each site a graph based clustering algorithm was used to group sites with similar hydrologic responses based on a minimally correlated subset of streamflow indices we call our algorithm a graph connectedness approach permutation tests were then used to relate these clusters to the pre restoration streamflow indices and watershed characteristics 2 1 hydrologic modeling the selected watersheds were simulated using the soil and water assessment tool swat a model of moderate complexity often used to quantify the hydrologic impacts of land cover change arnold et al 1998 de bressiani et al 2015 gassman et al 2007 swat represents many hydrologic processes including splitting runoff and infiltration flow through many soil layers and an unsaturated zone and baseflow from a shallow aquifer as well as resource responsive plant growth and time varying plant water use to do so swat includes characteristics such as the depth hydraulic conductivity and porosity of up to 10 soil layers a recession constant for a shallow aquifer and plant growth and leaf area parameters our approach integrates local high resolution data and hydrologic understanding from carefully constructed site models across the globe in a suite of geographic and climatic zones swat was selected for this study because its widespread use for water resource and ecosystem service assessment in many contexts francesconi et al 2016 gassman et al 2007 indicates acceptance by the water and land management communities and allows the collection of consistent simulations from basins around the globe swat includes two key features to investigate land cover change effects explicit land cover representation that can be easily changed arnold et al 2010 and a phenological vegetation model that responds to both climate and nutrient stresses williams 1995 the watersheds in this study cover a broad range of land cover types pedologic environments and management contexts this novel use of existing local high resolution site models represents a middle way between poorly constrained global hydrologic models döll et al 2016 wada et al 2011 and site specific assessments that provide strong conceptual understanding and predictive power for a single site vogl et al 2016b yoon 2017 the watershed simulations allow us to isolate the impacts of land cover change on streamflow while accounting for differences in climate soil properties and topography the site models were obtained from the authors of peer reviewed studies after selecting a subset from over 2500 site studies texas a m usda ars 2017 based on a number of key characteristics discussed here sites were chosen such that they cover köppen geiger climate zones peel et al 2007 to avoid oversampling temperate and cold sites in the us and europe the watersheds lie on 6 continents and in 11 second order köppen geiger climate zones fig 1 other simulation criteria included an area between 50 km2 and 20 000 km2 and at least five years of calibration data a nash sutcliffe efficiency nash and sutcliffe 1970 of 0 5 for daily discharge data or 0 7 for monthly discharge data and a bias of 20 accounting for groundwater abstraction and known point sources ensured satisfactory model performance per moriasi et al 2007 most sites had significantly more than 5 years of data and only 3 sites had solely monthly data with the others having daily calibration data available from the authors or publicly accessible government sites table 1 provides details about the site models for references see supplement si 1 all watershed site models were rebuilt in swat2012 rev 637 to eliminate differences in model structure calibration was performed via a split sample approach with approximately half of the data being used for simulation training and the other half reserved for verification re calibrations typically reduced over parameterization of spatially variable parameter values while conforming to the hydrologic processes formulated by the original site model authors for sites for which calibration was performed on a monthly basis but for which daily data were available the daily calibration statistics were checked and these models were re calibrated to improve daily statistics more detail on the calibration statistics can be found in supplement si 1 we refer to these re calibrated models as baseline scenarios throughout the paper 2 2 restoration scenario representation land cover change was simulated as restoration of 10 of the watershed area to pre development conditions pre development land cover was selected based on known ecological suitability in the watershed from current land cover and previous estimates ramankutty and foley 1999 land cover change was restricted to increasing one land cover and decreasing a second see supplement si 2 for details if 10 of the land cover could not be changed index value changes were linearly extrapolated to 10 from a baseline of 0 index change for 0 land cover change the sites were required to have at least 4 land cover change to avoid over interpreting this extrapolation 2 3 clustering with streamflow indices we assess the similarities and differences between the watersheds responses to restoration using a graph connectedness approach to define clusters of watersheds that respond in similar ways to do so we build a graph that has watersheds as the nodes and defines these nodes distance from each other by the similarity of the change in numerous streamflow index values after simulated restoration in the resulting graph watersheds that are close to each other have a similar response to restoration and those far from each other different responses to restoration that graph connectedness approach is detailed in the following subsections first we define a broad set of streamflow indices and calculate the index value changes between baseline and restoration scenarios we develop measures to reduce the effect of a small number of anomalously large index value changes second we use a dimension reduction approach to select a set of minimally correlated index value changes that still have clear meanings finally we construct a graph such that the watersheds with more similar responses to restoration are closer to each other we designate groups of close watersheds a cluster 2 3 1 streamflow indices a set of 141 streamflow indices is gathered from published literature that investigated changes in river discharge tested the similarities and differences in behavior across catchments and assessed local water resources for planning purposes these indices include many of those from the indicators of hydrologic alteration richter et al 1997 richter et al 1996 and extensions to that work gao et al 2009 kennen et al 2007 olden and poff 2003 catchment classification work carrillo et al 2011 sawicz et al 2011 and current guidance that summarizes classic water resources approaches used by the usgs and wmo hortness 2006 martin et al 2016 risley et al 2008 world meteorological organization 2009 ziegeweid et al 2015 these indices are selected because of their use in water resource planning and in describing flow differences across watersheds a full list of the indices and their literature citations are presented in supplement si 3 for each site the percent change in each of the 141 streamflow index values is calculated after calculating the index for both the existing land cover and the pre development land cover restoration scenario the percent change normalizes the effects of total discharge magnitude and watershed size and it readily permits statistical tests and other simple analyses percent change is defined such that an increase in the index value results in a positive percent change and vice versa preliminary analyses with these index value changes found that a small percentage 0 5 of them had anomalously large errors that dominated regression or dimension reduction approaches we address this by adopting two measures that remove the effect of these anomalously large changes in index values to build the graph discussed presently we use the index sign change i s which simply applies the sign function to the index value change with a tolerance that sets very small values to 0 see supplement si 4 hereafter we simply reference the sign of the index value change for statistical tests of the indices across different clusters in the graph we use a truncated index value change i t i t simply takes the percent change of the index value and truncates it to 25 so that all index values are within the range 25 25 this approach reduces the magnitude of the 0 5 of anomalously large index value changes to reduce their influence 2 3 2 selecting a minimally correlated subset of indices many of the streamflow index values and their changes are strongly correlated to one another gao et al 2009 olden and poff 2003 therefore we use principle component analysis pca pedregosa et al 2011 on the index sign change i s to avoid overweighting components in the graph analysis components were selected to cover 99 of the variance to ensure that important components are not ignored the principal components and their major contributing indices are shown in si 5 because the pca components are linear combinations of the streamflow index value changes these components are difficult to interpret thus they do not provide useful guidance for predicting hydrologic response to land cover change to address the challenge of interpreting the pca components we use varimax rotation varimax rotation finds the set of streamflow index value changes that maximizes the sum of the variance of the square loadings that is it seeks to have each component represented by one or a few very large loadings from streamflow index value changes and no loadings from other streamflow index value changes these strongly loaded streamflow index value changes of the same dimension as the pca represent the set of index value changes most similar to the purely orthogonal pca components varimax rotation is performed with python s factor rotation package van der schans 2015 these index value changes represent the same variance in the system as the pca components but provide a clearer interpretation at the cost of increased correlation between the indices here these reduced dimension index value changes are used to construct the graph the 26 streamflow index value changes selected through pca and varimax rotation are shown in table 2 along with basic definitions and their primary source we group them into 6 families low flow monthly flow monthly flow variance integrated signal daily flow and high flow the low flow family describes the changes in magnitude frequency duration and variability of low flows low flow here is defined alternately as all flows less than 1 the 75 exceedance flow 2 the minimum 30 day average flow or 3 the minimum 7 day average flow in addition a digital filter is run to estimate the baseflow recession arnold and allen 1999 and the resulting change in recession constant is included the monthly flow family describes the change in maximum or minimum flow in a given month the monthly flow variance family describes the changes in variability in the monthly average flow for a given month or the variance among monthly flows the integrated signal family brings together multiple years of flow through the flow duration curve the daily flow family deals with either the daily change of flow or with particular days when criteria are met the high flow family describes the changes in the magnitude timing and duration of high flow periods defined as larger than 3 or 7 median 25 exceedance or the average maximum daily or 7 day flow 2 3 3 clustering approach we use a graph connectedness approach with a spring based visualization kamada and kawai 1989 to cluster and investigate the similarities and differences among the watersheds streamflow changes after simulated land cover restoration the approach is then extended to help identify watershed characteristics that cluster in the same manner as the changes in streamflow index values and thus are likely related to the hydrologic responses to land cover change although graph based clustering has been used in other fields e g hartuv et al 2000 to our knowledge our application of the graph connectedness approach in searching for watershed similarity is novel as shown it yields useful multi dimensional similarity in clusters based on relatively few assumptions we discuss the graph connectedness approach to clustering here and statistical tests of features correlation with the graph based clusters in section 2 4 note that the term features as used here refers to both streamflow index values not their changes and watershed characteristics the graph connectedness approach builds a network with each site serving as a node the distance between the nodes is set by a measure of similarity between the change in streamflow index values at each site and implemented as a graph link sometime referred to as an edge in other applications between the nodes with a length proportional to this distance we define the similarity as l 1 r where r is the correlation of the signs of the observed change in streamflow index values discussed presently thus smaller distances represent more similar sites and larger distances less similar sites the graph shape is determined by a model that minimizes the energy in a spring kamada and kawai 1989 this model is analogous to a physical system in which springs with different resting lengths are linked between nodes with the energy in each spring increasing as the square of the link s length away from the resting 0 energy distance consistent with a simple spring obeying hooke s law once all the springs are linked the system is set free and it eventually comes to rest in a minimum energy state hagberg et al 2010 this enables easy visualization of the relationships between nodes and the delineation of clusters the graph is built using the sign correlation as the similarity measure this is the broadest measure of index value change similarity we could determine and was selected to reduce the effects of the 0 5 of anomalously large index value changes that otherwise dominate measures of similarity the sign correlation simply represents the percentage of streamflow indices showing value changes of the same sign between two sites under land cover restoration the sign correlations can take any value between 0 no index value changes have the same sign between two sites to 100 all index value changes have the same sign between the two sites three signs are possible for each index value change 1 is an increase 1 is a decrease and 0 is no change see si 4 for details we assume that sites that have the same direction of change of an index value are more likely to behave similarly a graph with links between each pair of nodes would include near random connections between many sites which we address by including only links that connect sites more strongly weakly than would be expected by chance to determine the chance level of connection between the streamflow index value changes for two watersheds we develop a simple null model with the same structure discussed in supplement si 6 2 4 permutation tests and effect size to identify watershed characteristics related to clusters permutation tests are employed to investigate which features might be associated with which clusters permutation tests are a non parametric statistical test good 2005 consider a group of watershed feature metric values v split into two clusters with sizes c 1 and c 2 the difference between the mean value of the v in each cluster is calculated this difference is then checked against clusters of the same size created from permutations of all of the values v from a large number of permutations we estimate the probability that the mean feature values are statistically distinct across the observed clusters we use the null hypothesis that the means of the features in the two clusters are the same the test provides a probability that an observed difference of feature metric values across clusters is statistically significant suggesting that the feature is related to the clusters permutation tests are run on three different features against the clusters determined through the graph connectedness approach 1 the changes in streamflow index values as determined previously the signs of which are used to build the graph 2 the watershed characteristics and 3 the streamflow index values based on pre restoration land cover permutation tests on the changes in streamflow index values help determine which indices drive the clustering the python package permute stark et al 2015 is used for permutation tests the effect sizes of the feature differences across clusters indicate the degree to which clusters are distinguishable by that feature distinguishable features likely contribute to watershed responses to land cover change we use cohen s d a standard effect size metric welkowitz et al 2012 that reflects the difference in the means of the clusters 1 d x 1 x 2 s with x c the mean of cluster c and s the pooled standard deviation between the two clusters s is defined as 2 s m 1 1 s 1 2 m 2 1 s 2 2 m 1 m 2 2 with m c the number of members of cluster c and s c 2 the sample variance for cluster c we search for effect sizes greater than 1 so that the means differ by more than the pooled standard deviation which we expect indicates that such a feature is substantially different and thus distinct across the clusters this indicates that the feature likely contributes to differences in hydrologic behavior cohen s d is similar to the inverse of the coefficient of variation seeking to make sure that the difference in means is large relative to the standard deviation 3 results we first discuss the graph and define the three identified clusters of watershed response to land cover change the low flow intensifying sites the high flow intensifying sites and the high flow enhancing sites next permutation test results are presented for three categories a changes in streamflow index values after land cover change b watershed characteristics and c pre restoration streamflow index values in the low flow intensifying sites simulated streamflow increases during low flow periods and decreases during high flow periods the opposite occurs in the high flow intensifying sites the low flow intensifying sites contain shallower soils and smaller soil water volumes than the high flow intensifying sites the high flow enhancing sites have soil depths similar to the high flow intensifying sites but also larger hydraulic conductivity as a result the high flow enhancing sites change in the same direction as the high flow intensifying sites but with a smaller magnitude finally we explain additional features of different clusters of watersheds for which streamflow responds similarly to land cover change 3 1 graph connectedness clustering 3 1 1 sign correlation of restoration scenario shows three coherent clusters fig 2 shows the graph built from the sign correlation of the changes in streamflow index values for 10 restoration of pre development land there are three primary clusters shown as red brown and yellow in addition there are small clusters consisting of 2 or 3 sites and several sites that are not in a cluster with weak similarity to any other site which we designate in dark grey shades and light grey shades respectively we define the three primary clusters apparent by visual inspection fig 2 low flow intensifying high flow enhancing and high flow intensifying the clusters are named after the behavior of related sets of indices as shown in fig 3 and discussed below the clusters and graph shape are determined by the sign correlations noted next to the links in fig 2 as discussed in the methods clusters were identified as those watersheds showing sign correlations with a significance level α of 0 05 in the random null model this corresponds to a sign correlation of 61 watersheds with sign correlations that were all 61 were set aside as outside the three primary clusters see supplement si 6 there are 7 9 and 5 sites in the low flow intensifying high flow intensifying and high flow enhancing clusters respectively the graph as shown uses a stronger significance level α 0 025 for clarity links stronger than the random null model with significance level α 0 025 a sign correlation 63 are shown as solid black lines links with a sign correlation 63 but still included per the methods section criteria are noted with dotted grey lines in addition sign correlations weaker than the random null model with α 0 025 22 push away dissimilar watersheds in the graph but are not shown for clarity they are included in supplement si 7 which lists all sign correlations used to construct the graph sites falling in between clusters that met the 61 sign correlation threshold were assigned to only one of the clusters based on their highest sign correlation to all members of the competing clusters we identified the yass river catchment in australia as a member of the low flow intensifying cluster based on its status as a hub with the strongest connection for many sites the reda catchment in poland was identified as a member of the high flow intensifying cluster based on its links to two high flow intensifying cluster members of about the same strength as its connection to the yass the nam ou in laos was identified as a member of the high flow intensifying cluster because of its stronger link to the po ko in vietnam than the shibetsu in japan the shibetsu was selected as a member of the high flow enhancing cluster because of its stronger connections to the upper upatoi in georgia us and the s fork of the cour d alene in idaho us 3 1 2 cluster similarities and membership the differences in the clusters are fundamentally multivariate and there is no single streamflow index that individually defines them however there are a number of consistent streamflow responses that vary across clusters table 3 shows the mean change of a set of streamflow index values that are statistically different across clusters fig 3 shows that the watersheds in each cluster have different responses to land cover change the figure shows the rank order of values for a subset 8 of 10 of the indices from table 3 including the median flow value as radar plots the signs of the index values were reversed for low flow occurrence and monthly flow variability because a reduction in these index values leads to increasing low flow the values were ranked from smallest to largest as 1 to 3 the outer rim of the radar plot axis is 3 and the center point is 1 ties resulted in repeated rank values the baseflow recession and high flow volume were omitted because they are unintuitive and do not change the results the median flow is one of the 141 pre dimension reduction indices and was included because it provides a simple measure of central tendency comparing the pre restoration simulation to the restoration land cover simulation the low flow intensifying cluster generally sees a rise in the flow during relatively dry and average periods and a decline in the discharge during high flow periods this is a regulating behavior that is typically desired for watershed services shifting discharge from high flow periods to low flow periods both to reduce the chance of flood damage and to provide consistent dry season flow this can be seen clearly by the largest rank in low flow index value changes including low flow occurrence and increase in low summer flow and the smallest rank in high flow indices such as high flow seasonality the high flow intensifying cluster in contrast sees a decrease in discharge during low flow periods and an increase in the relative high flows as well as flow variability the high flow value changes show a large rank including the largest rank for high flow magnitude and high flow seasonality and the second largest for pre peak flow this cluster generally has the smallest rank in the low flow and intermediate flow indices including 10 more low flow occurrences and 8 less low summer flow this reduction in low flow is sometimes a concern when considering the hydrologic effects of restoration the high flow enhancing cluster sees similar responses to the high flow intensifying cluster but the magnitudes are smaller so the enhancing cluster generally has the middle rank it does have the largest value change for pre peak flow and is the only cluster that has a positive mean value change for that index however it has the middle rank for high flow magnitude high flow seasonality and low flow occurrence 3 1 3 indices across clusters the clusters are further distinguishable by their marked differences in mean value changes of specific indices first consider the high flow magnitude response to land cover restoration the low flow intensifying cluster has a decline of 6 of the high flow magnitude see table 3 which is statistically different α 0 05 from the high flow intensifying and high flow enhancing clusters that show rises of 5 and 1 respectively the permutation tests show particularly low p values p 0 0025 see methods section for null hypothesis as well as effect sizes of 2 4 and 1 7 for the low flow intensifying cluster compared to the high flow intensifying and high flow enhancing clusters since the difference between the rise in the high flow magnitude in the high flow intensifying and low flow intensifying clusters is more than twice their variability we argue they represent fundamentally different responses second changes in the average flow also highlights the hydrologic response differences of the three clusters resulting from restoration land cover change consider the median flow or 50 exceedance flow of the sites within each cluster from the list of 141 indices the median flow value in the high flow intensifying and high flow enhancing clusters show a decline of 6 and 2 respectively while the low flow intensifying cluster shows a rise of 4 the high flow intensifying and low flow intensifying clusters have statistically different means with p 0 0003 and the high flow intensifying and high flow enhancing clusters have different means with p 0 008 these clusters have effect sizes of 1 7 and 1 5 respectively it is noteworthy that the change in median flow is found to be statistically different across the three clusters but was not selected by the dimension reduction approach third index value changes reflecting land cover restoration impact on low flow show statistically significant differences across clusters see table 3 specifically comparing to the pre restoration case the low flow intensifying cluster has reduced mean of low flow occurrences rather than the increased mean of low flow occurrences in the high flow intensifying cluster with p value 0 0026 and effect size 1 9 the high flow enhancing cluster has a mean change that differs from the high flow intensifying cluster with a p value of 0 03 and effect size of 1 2 together the differences and similarities across clusters reveal a consistent set of themes as shown in fig 3 in the low flow intensifying cluster the high flow decreases while in the high flow intensifying cluster and less so in the high flow enhancing cluster high flow increases relative to the median flow in each watershed in the low flow intensifying cluster watersheds the water that went to high flow in the pre restoration land cover case is instead stored and released during low flow periods in the high flow intensifying and high flow enhancing clusters restoration affects the modeled flow in one of two ways 1 the water that comprises low flow and average flow are each diminished because that water is routed more quickly to the high flow regime and 2 greater evapotranspiration lowers both high flow and median flow in both of these cases there is a higher proportion of high flow to median flow 3 2 soil characteristics and slope of flow duration curve are strongly related to clusters we explored which watershed characteristics and streamflow index values based on pre restoration land cover are most strongly related to the three clusters as determined by permutation tests the most obvious characteristics such as geographic location and climate zone do not show strong relationships to the clusters as shown in fig 1 for example the high flow intensifying cluster includes sites from vietnam iran brazil poland and indiana the high flow enhancing cluster includes sites from brazil japan idaho and georgia usa fig 4 shows the values of watershed characteristics and streamflow indices for each site while table 4 presents the results of statistical tests and effect sizes in each section of fig 4 each column represents a site and the columns are grouped according to the clusters each box shows the value of the feature defined on the left at that site through both color and the printing of the value in the box the color scale on the right side of the boxes corresponds to these values these color scales are sometimes truncated to better represent the distribution table 4 provides the permutation test p value and the effect size across clusters 3 2 1 importance of soil depth hydraulic conductivity and water content soil characteristics are the only watershed characteristics that predict cluster membership fig 4a the soil depth and saturated water content are both significantly smaller α 0 05 in the low flow intensifying sites than in either the high flow intensifying or high flow enhancing sites with effect sizes greater than 1 these results show that in our simulations high flow is reduced and low flow increased in only those sites that have relatively thin soils which might be improved through restoration of land cover soil clay percentage and sand percentage differ statistically α 0 05 between the low flow intensifying and high flow enhancing clusters the high flow enhancing cluster has sandier soils and the low flow intensifying cluster has more clay rich soils this suggests that in our simulations increasing infiltration in low flow intensifying cluster sites may lead to a diminution in high flow and rise in low flow under land cover restoration these soil characteristics are not independent but all are presented here to show the differences and similarities soil hydraulic conductivity in contrast is significantly smaller α 0 05 in the high flow intensifying cluster than the high flow enhancing cluster and is the only physical characteristic that separates these two clusters this suggests that the primary difference between the sets of watersheds in their respective clusters is simply how fast water moves through the soils in the high flow enhancing cluster sites the water moves quickly through the soil and recharges groundwater so the response to land cover restoration is lower than that in the high flow intensifying cluster sites the high flow intensifying cluster sites in contrast have slower flow through the soil which leads to a larger low flow decrease and smaller high flow decline as the restored land cover can transpire water that has a longer soil residence time many other characteristics were tested including watershed shape elevation and slope climate and pre restoration land cover but none of these showed a significant difference among the clusters 3 2 2 hydrologic behavior under pre restoration land cover shows strong relationships to restored watershed response in addition to the watershed characteristics we also analyzed pre restoration streamflow index values to determine which indices might correlate with the graph based clusters and thus provide useful information about the similarities and differences in watershed behavior across these clusters fig 4b and c show the pre restoration streamflow index values arranged by cluster and table 4 the results of permutation tests and effect sizes across the clusters there are significant differences between clusters in the hydrologic response as measured by the flow duration curve duration curve which shows how often flow exceeds any given value and thus serves as an integrated measure of the likelihood of experiencing flow conditions in the long term here we represent the duration curve by the average flow variability technically the concavity index which is the slope of the line connecting the 33 and 66 exceedance daily flows and the slope of the duration curve in the range from 1 to 10 exceedance high flow duration index a high value of average flow variability means that there is large mid range flow variability of the duration curve a duration curve with a large high flow duration index has a smaller number of extremely large events and fewer moderately large events we found that average flow variability in the low flow intensifying cluster is significantly smaller than in the high flow intensifying cluster fig 4b table 4b there are 11 440 possible combinations of the 16 average flow variability samples comprised by the seven watersheds in the low flow intensifying cluster and the nine watersheds in the high flow intensifying cluster we found a perfect sorting with the high flow intensifying cluster having the largest values of average flow variability and the low flow intensifying cluster having the smallest values and an effect size of 2 6 between the two this perfect sorting is one of the two most extreme cases of the 11 440 combinations the average flow variability value does not have the same perfect sorting between the low flow intensifying and high flow enhancing clusters but the difference is still significant α 0 05 with effect size 1 8 regarding the high flow duration index there were extreme differences between the low flow intensifying and high flow intensifying clusters again with perfect sorting the effect size for the high flow duration index is slightly smaller than that for the average flow variability but it is still above 2 the low flow intensifying cluster s steeper slope indicates that the streams are flashier as there is a larger range between the few extreme flows and the moderately large events the high flow intensifying cluster s smaller slope indicates more consistent values between extreme and more common high flows or less flashy behavior the low flow intensifying and high flow enhancing clusters also show a significant difference α 0 05 in this high flow duration index and have an effect size of 1 5 but lack perfect sorting further results also suggests that the low flow intensifying cluster sites are predominately governed by a few very large flows and have more constant low flows during the rest of the year when compared to the high flow intensifying and high flow enhancing cluster sites specifically we found that mean daily flow median daily flow index values have a structure similar to that of the high flow duration index values with the low flow intensifying cluster sites having large values and the high flow intensifying and high flow enhancing cluster sites having smaller values the difference is significant α 0 05 but the effect size is only 1 a few additional indices that describe flow variability show distinctions between the clusters though not as strongly as duration curve indices which describe long term integrated watershed response these daily flow variability indices are also shown in fig 4b and table 4b the coefficient of variation cv of daily flow has perfect sorting between the low flow intensifying and high flow intensifying clusters with an effect size of 1 7 the low flow intensifying cluster watersheds have a larger cv only one site in the high flow enhancing cluster has a cv of daily flow value larger than any site in the low flow intensifying cluster the low flow intensifying cluster sites also have a more variable number of flow reversals across years than the high flow intensifying cluster sites with effect size 1 though they are not distinguishable from the high flow enhancing cluster sites due to one highly variable site in the latter cluster the cv in the rate of flow change during periods of increasing flow is larger in the low flow intensifying cluster watersheds than the high flow intensifying cluster watersheds finally the median flow change for consecutive days of increasing flow is significantly larger in the high flow enhancing cluster than the high flow intensifying cluster this suggests that discharge increases more quickly in the watersheds in the high flow enhancing cluster than those in the high flow intensifying cluster consistent with the former cluster s larger hydraulic conductivity the low flow intensifying cluster has smaller and relatively more variable pre restoration low flow than the high flow enhancing or high flow intensifying clusters as shown in fig 4c and table 4c the baseflow fraction index value is larger in both the high flow intensifying and the high flow enhancing clusters than in the low flow intensifying cluster α 0 05 with effect sizes 2 2 and 1 5 respectively the high flow intensifying cluster only has one out of nine values that are lower than any in the low flow intensifying cluster associated with its lower baseflow fraction the low flow intensifying cluster has a larger variance in the daily baseflow estimated using a digital filter arnold and allen 1999 and a larger cv in the date of the annual minimum flow supplement si 8 shows that there is a similar difference across clusters in a number of high flow index values calculated for the pre restoration simulation other indices did not show significant differences between clusters these similarities may also be important for interpreting the similarities and differences in watershed response to land cover change and are discussed in supplement si 9 these indices include the average flow change during periods of rising flow and the slope of the duration curve from 75 to 99 exceedance 4 discussion 4 1 indicators of watershed response we employed 29 hydrologic site models to investigate the change in a variety of streamflow indices after simulated land cover restoration these results provide useful information about the types of watersheds where watershed service investments in land cover restoration might provide valuable water resource improvements and where they might instead disrupt local flow benefits in particular sites in the low flow intensifying cluster display the behavior desired from watershed service investment for land cover restoration spreading stream discharge over time even if the penalty is a loss of annual water yield sites in the high flow intensifying cluster instead see a decline in water yield with a particularly notable decline during low flow periods sites in the high flow enhancing cluster show the same basic responses as those in the high flow intensifying cluster but less so to the point that declines in water yield and particularly low flow might not be noticed our analysis is distinct from the spatial targeting of land cover change inside a watershed which has been the focus of other work guswa et al 2014 jackson et al 2013 vogl et al 2016a b instead we investigate the general conditions under which land cover change might provide tangible watershed services 4 1 1 watershed characteristics soil depth saturated water content and hydraulic conductivity have significantly different values across the delineated clusters this suggests that watersheds with relatively thin soils that cannot hold significant amounts of water may be more likely to transfer water from high flow to low flow regimes upon land cover restoration this outcome could be beneficial even though it is likely to also produce a reduction in total water yield among sites with thicker soils and higher saturated water contents those sites with relatively high hydraulic conductivities may be likely to see smaller reductions in low flow and smaller relative increases in high flow as the water can flow quickly through the soil profile and thus is affected less by vegetation in contrast similar sites but having low hydraulic conductivity soils may be likely to see a decrease in low flow as well as a relative rise in high flow representing a significant water resource cost to land cover restoration 4 1 2 flow duration curve the average flow variability and the high flow duration indices based on the flow duration curve for the pre restoration case also showed significant differences across clusters this led us to further investigate the features of the flow duration curves for sites in each cluster in fig 5 we plot the 29 duration curves where flow y axis is normalized by the maximum flow for each site lines are color coded by the clusters identified in fig 2 the inset panel provides a simple summary by displaying the median curves for all sites in each cluster there are 8 sites that are not in the three primary clusters which are colored light grey there is a clear difference in the nature of the duration curves for each cluster the watersheds in the low flow intensifying cluster tend to have much more concave duration curves than those in the high flow intensifying or high flow enhancing clusters as seen in fig 5 this is consistent with the observations above wherein the watersheds with more concave normalized pre restoration duration curves shift more water from the high flow period to low flow periods after restoration in contrast the watersheds with less concave normalized pre restoration duration curves transfer water to low flow periods efficiently before restoration after restoration these watersheds experience increased evapotranspiration and consequently provide less discharge during low flow periods overall those watersheds with stronger variability in flow are more likely to have restoration of pre development land cover increase low flows while those with a smoother distribution of flows are not 4 2 field studies despite significant effort by many hydrologists a clear understanding of the factors that drive the hydrologic response to land cover change remains elusive field studies remain key constraints on such understanding and our results are consistent with a number of field studies however many field studies have focused on land cover changes that are not directly applicable to watershed service investment for several reasons 1 many investigate annual water yield which is not the most relevant measure for most water resource considerations 2 many focus on small scale experimental catchments of 1 1000 ha with extreme land cover change often approaching 100 to achieve statistical power but which are not necessarily realistic for watershed investments that change smaller fractions of larger watersheds with areas in the 100s 1000s km2 3 others address differences in hydrologic response with land cover across catchments but do not provide clear guidance for the response to change and 4 many studies have a strong bias towards temperate and cold climates where most data are available bosch and hewlett 1982 brown et al 2005 2013 carrillo et al 2011 hamel et al 2017 ogden et al 2013 price et al 2011 sahin and hall 1996 sawicz et al 2011 scott and lesch 1997 stednick 1996 wagener et al 2007 whitehead and robinson 1993 yadav et al 2007 the broad paired catchment literature is consistent with our results showing a reduction in annual water yield under afforestation brown et al 2005 farley et al 2005 filoso et al 2017 previous work has suggested that changes in water yield cannot be detected experimentally with changes of 20 of the watershed because of the natural variability bosch and hewlett 1982 stednick 1996 however brown et al 2005 suggest it is still possible to predict the response of smaller land cover changes such prediction is consistent with the small reductions in water yield for almost all sites and in all three clusters that are apparent because the watershed simulations hold all conditions identical except for land cover studies of low flow changes due to land cover change find more variability than those of annual water yield consistent with our results paired catchment studies have found that afforestation decreases low flow farley et al 2005 particularly that forested catchments had 90 exceedance flows that were 10 90 lower than the 90 exceedance flows of non forested catchments brown et al 2013 scott and lesch 1997 this result is similar to that from our high flow intensifying and high flow enhancing clusters though stronger because they often represent the watershed response to much larger land cover change than the 10 we simulated other work has found that forested watersheds had larger low flows from 1 to 50 ogden et al 2013 and 6 24 price et al 2011 which could be consistent with our low flow intensifying cluster note that these were not however experimental land cover changes but rather comparisons across paired watersheds with different amounts of forest from previous disturbance price et al 2011 tested the effect of the percent area of colluvium on baseflow in the presence of different amounts of forest cover and found that increased colluvium and forest cover were positively related to increases in baseflow metrics if we assume that increased colluvium corresponds with decreased soil depth this is consistent with our findings that sites with smaller soil depth were in the low flow intensifying cluster the variable low flow effects of land cover are consistent with the distinct and differing direction responses seen in the watersheds in the low flow intensifying versus high flow intensifying clusters however it is not possible to draw robust links between these field studies and our models because of the lack of data on the field study conditions none of the sites in this study have significant fog capture so we do not see the potential increased low flow because of increased water input from forests in these uncommon circumstances bruijnzeel et al 2011 ellison et al 2012 4 3 analysis caveats as a moderate complexity model swat includes structural limitations that may affect the results of this work most importantly swat s hydrologic response units hrus are not fully spatially connected within subbasins the hrus are spatially discontiguous units that connect to the stream and subbasins are connected through the stream network the lack of connectivity may be particularly important for land cover change in riparian zones where tree removal may have large effects on streamflow everson et al 2007 scott 1999 scott et al 2004 our analysis assumed a uniform land cover restoration across the watershed with shifts from a single land cover to another sensitivity analyses assessed the effects of both localized restoration and more complex land cover shifts and showed that the differences were small dennedy frank and gorelick 2019 appendices a 7 a 8 however the lack of full spatial connectivity does mean that riparian zones in particular may not be appropriately sensitive to these changes there was no relationship between the streamflow changes after restoration and either the size or number of either hrus or subbasins across sites 5 conclusions we investigated the similarities and differences of streamflow changes after the restoration of pre development land cover in 29 sites around the world the sites represent a novel database of previously peer reviewed hydrologic models simulated using swat a tool used extensively by the land and water management communities we find three primary clusters sharing common hydrologic responses to restoration 1 low flow intensifying cluster 2 high flow intensifying cluster and 3 high flow enhancing cluster under restoration the low flow intensifying cluster sites show enhanced discharge during low flow periods and a decline in discharge during high flow periods shifting discharge from high flow to low flow periods is typically a desired outcome for watershed services in contrast the high flow intensifying cluster is characterized by sites in which there is a decrease in discharge during low flow periods and an increased variability of discharge in the near average flow regime similarly the high flow enhancing cluster sites exhibit a decrease in discharge during the low flow periods though of smaller magnitude than the high flow intensifying cluster among watershed characteristics soil depth and saturated soil water content show statistically significant differences across these clusters our results suggest that these soil properties may be a primary driver in watershed response to land cover restoration no non soil watershed characteristics showed a statistically significant difference across the three clusters in sites where the soils are relatively thin restoration results in watershed responses that generate a more even temporal distribution of flow which is often desired in contrast where soils are thick and hydraulic conductivity is low there may instead be a loss of watershed service because of the increased opportunity for evapotranspiration soil depth and hydraulic properties serve as aggregate indicators of effects such as land cover climate and source material and may serve as a particularly valuable indicator of coevolution state troch et al 2015 we show that several flow indices particularly those describing attributes of the flow duration curve have statistically significant differences across clusters the average flow variability index and the high flow duration index are most important the flow duration curves for sites in the low flow intensifying cluster are generally more concave than those in the high flow intensifying and high flow enhancing clusters which indicates that under land cover restoration the water in the high flow periods of the low flow intensifying cluster sites is shifted to low flow periods in the high flow intensifying and high flow enhancing clusters land cover restoration does not transfer additional water to low flow instead increasing water loss to evapotranspiration these results provide a key step in the systematic understanding of how land cover shifts change streamflow and watershed services and inform better prediction of sites where restoration will add value as natural capital credit authorship contribution statement p james dennedy frank

5237,effective soil thermal conductivity λeff is required by a variety of science and engineering studies and associated numerical simulations because water content is the dominant factor determining the magnitude of λeff modeling of λeff is usually based on the measured water content θ or degree of saturation sr however these approaches are largely soil dependent and no model was found for universal application prediction of λeff from energy states of soil water i e ψ the matric potential or matric suction provides a unique way that takes pore size and geometry of soil into account and the resultant λeff ψ relationship is less sensitive to soil types compared to the λeff θ and λeff sr relationships the λeff ψ relationship developed by mccumber and pielke 1981 mp1981 has been incorporated into over 10 land surface climate or hydrological models for wide applications but the mp1981 model was reported to give unreasonable estimates especially at low ψ range lu et al 2019 ls2019 proposed an improved λeff ψ model but limited to applications in high ψ range the objective of this study was to develop a new λeff ψ model for applications across the full range of matric potential experimental measurements of λeff ψ taken on 26 soils from four studies were used for the model development a comparison of the new model with the mp1981 ls2019 and three other literature models showed the new model gave satisfactory estimates rmse 0 2 w m 1 c 1 ad 0 w m 1 c 1 and nse 0 9 that outperformed all the other models however there is a lack of experimental measurements of

effective thermal conductivity of soil λeff w m 1 c 1 describes the soil s ability to conduct heat along a temperature gradient it is a critical thermo physical parameter required in many disciplines

soil thermal conductivity noborio and mcinnes 1993 abu hamdeh and reeder 2000 wang et al 2019 water content has been proved to play a vital role in determining the magnitude of λeff johansen 1975 farouki 1981 he et al 2017 yan et al 2019 he et al 2020 because the water status of a soil can be expressed as volumetric or gravimetric water content the degree of saturation or energy status i e matric suction ψ the negative of matric potential predictive models of λeff can also be based on them these soil thermal conductivity models are also referred as porosity or saturation dependent models ghanbarian et al 2015 ghanbarian and daigle 2016 sadeghi et al 2018 or thermal conductivity dry out curves in engineering smits et al 2010 likos 2014 wu et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 numerous predictive models for soil thermal conductivity are available in the literature cheng and hsu 1999 dong et al 2015 zhang et al 2018a he et al 2020 wang et al 2020a but a majority of them are based on volumetric water content θ or λeff θ relationship de vries 1963 he et al 2017 gravimetric water content θg or λeff θg relationship kersten 1949 or degree of saturation sr or λeff sr relationship johansen 1975 côté and konrad 2005 only a few predictive models of λeff were developed by relating λeff to soil independent matric potential ψ or hereafter referred to as λeff ψ relationships mccumber and pielke 1981 reece 1996 nichol et al 2003 kroener et al 2018 lu et al 2019 the virtue of the λeff ψ relationship is that it accounts for soil pore size distribution and geometry and it enables the study of coupled water and heat transport in soil the first example of λeff ψ relationships is the model of mccumber and pielke 1981 hereafter mp1981 which is one of the most widely applied soil thermal conductivity models the mp1981 model has been incorporated in over 10 hydrological models land surface models earth system models and climate models including ecmwf eta lss isba leaf olam ncep noah osu caps svats uvmm wrf to predict soil temperature and surface heat flux noilhan and mahfouf 1996 smirnova et al 1997 chen and dudhia 2001 fernando et al 2013 massey et al 2014 however a large discrepancy was found between the measured and predicted λeff ψ peters lidard et al 1998 and even physically unreasonable estimates of λeff ψ at high ψ range were reported chen and dudhia 2001 béhaegel et al 2007 lu et al 2019 the unsatisfactory performance of mp1981 model may be attributed to a lack of measurements of λeff ψ the empirical thermal conductivity models cannot be extrapolated for applications beyond soil types or water content range used to develop the model he et al 2017 only a small dataset of al nakshabandi and kohnke 1965 consisting of three soils i e fine sand silt loam and clay were used to develop the mp1981 model in addition the λeff ψ were not measured across the full matric potential range i e 2 1 pf 7 pf lg ψ the common logarithm of ψ in cm for fine sand pf 2 9 pf 7 for silt loam and 3 8 pf 7 for clay moreover the data points of λeff ψ were possibly not measured on the same sample for each soil because varied bulk densities were given no details on the measurements were found in the paper i e 1 40 1 43 g cm 3 for fine sand 1 15 1 30 g cm 3 for silt loam and 0 89 1 00 g cm 3 for clay al nakshabandi and kohnke 1965 based on a much larger dataset with λeff and ψ measured on the same soil samples lu et al 2019 proposed a new model similar to that of mp1981 hereafter ls2019 the ls2019 model significantly improved the ability of predicting the λeff ψ relationship compared to the mp1981 model however the ls2019 model is limited to pf 3 and variations still exist between the modeled and measured λeff ψ because they found a highly nonlinear λeff ψ relationship and it varied strongly with soil texture and bulk density the objective of this study was to develop a new λeff ψ model that can be used to estimate λeff across the full range of matric potential a performance comparison was made between the proposed new model and other λeff ψ models available in the literature with published dataset 2 material and methods 2 1 predictive models for estimating λeff ψ 2 1 1 mccumber and pielke 1981 mp1981 model based on experimental measurements on three soils i e clay silt loam and fine sand made by al nakshabandi and kohnke 1965 mccumber and pielke 1981 developed an exponential relationship between λeff and soil matric potential 1 λ eff 418 4 exp p f 2 7 0 1715 pf 5 1 p f 5 1 a b where the coefficient 418 4 is used to convert cal s 1 cm 1 c 1 to si unit w m 1 c 1 and ψ is soil water matric potential cm h2o and pf lg ψ is the common logarithm of ψ in cm a single probe heat pulse sphp probe was used to measure λeff the mp1981 assumed that ψ θ was nearly independent of soil texture class 2 1 2 reece 1996 rc1996 model reece 1996 developed a λeff ψ relationship for measuring ψ with a line heat dissipation sensor which consisted of a sphp probe embedded in a cylindrical porous ceramic 2 λ eff λ dry s e n s o r 1 a 1 a 2 ln 10 10 pf 1 where 10 10pf is used to convert pf back to j kg 1 to keep constant with the original study fitting parameters a1 0 032 and a2 0 127 r2 0 996 were suggested in the original work λdry sensor is the thermal conductivity of ceramic sensor body when no water exists eq 2 was slightly different from eqs 9 and 10 in reece 1996 because it was expressed as relative thermal resistivity m k w 1 as a function of matric potential j kg 1 2 1 3 nichol et al 2003 nc2003 model nichol et al 2003 proposed an equation accounting for the effects of soil thermal conductivity stc sensors on the measured λeff 3 λ eff t ψ λ dry s e n s o r f ψ λ w t where λdry sensor is the thermal conductivity of ceramic sensor body when no water exists nichol et al 2003 used λdry sensor 0 15 w m 1 c 1 based on study of shuai et al 1998 f ψ is the fractional contribution of water as a function of matric potential to λeff eq 2 of reece 1996 and shuai et al 1998 was used the λ w t is temperature dependent thermal conductivity of water for calculating the temperature correction for different matric potentials nichol et al 2003 λ w t is calculated by 4 λ w t 8 10 6 t 2 0 002 t 0 5607 where t is temperature c 2 1 4 kroener et al 2018 ke2018 model kroener et al 2018 developed an λeff ψ relationship based on five soils i e quincy fine sand ritzville silt loam walla walla silt loam palouse silt loam and naff silt loam of mcinnes 1981 and campbell 1988 5 λ eff 1 28 1 14 1 10 pf 22 7 0 588 the constants in eq 5 are fitting parameters the ke2018 model produced an s shaped λeff ψ and it also assumed that the λeff ψ relationship is independent of soil texture similar to the mp1981 model 2 1 5 lu et al 2019 ls2019 model lu et al 2019 proposed an exponential relationship to predict λeff for pf 3 based on measurement of repacked and intact samples 6 λ eff exp 1 12 0 38 p f the constants in eq 6 are fitting parameters 2 1 6 new model previous studies showed that it is possible to obtain a nearly soil texture independent λeff ψ relationship but they generally failed to model λeff at high soil matric potential i e high water content the exponential functions they used can only capture the exponential increase of soil water content and λeff as of function of matric potential at the first three soil water retention regimes of hydration i e water attracted by intermolecular forces provided by van der waals attraction cations and anions or hydrogen bond of water pendular i e water froms discrete menisci near particle contacts and funicular i e menisci are interconnected to each other however the water content and λeff remain little change at the capillary regime i e air phase become occluded bubbles or when matric potential is less than the air entry point likos 2014 lu and dong 2015 he et al 2017 therefore the exponential function alone cannot simulate the sigmoidal shape of λeff ψ across the full range of matric potential or all four soil water retention regimes given the similarity between λeff ψ and soil water retention characteristics we proposed an air entry point ψb dependent two segmented functions 7 λ eff ψ λ sat a 1 p f a 2 pf ψ b p f ψ b a b where a1 and a2 are fitting parameters that are associated with a power function in eq 7b 2 2 data collection and analysis simultaneous measurements of λeff θ and ψ were made on the same sample intact or repacked providing a unique opportunity to analyze the λeff ψ relationship an extensive literature search showed that only a few such studies were conducted over the past decades 1960s to 2020 measured λeff ψ on 26 soils from five studies were obtained by digitizing the figures and tables in the literature or by personal communications al nakshabandi and kohnke 1965 mcinnes 1981 lu et al 2007 nguyen et al 2017 lu et al 2019 the selected soil physical properties were tabulated table 1 and detailed descriptions of the experimental setup can be found in the respective studies a brief introduction of the measurement methods for the compiled dataset is given below 1 λeff was measured with the transient heat pulse method including the single probe heat pulse sphp and the dual probe heat pulse method dphp with customized al nakshabandi and kohnke 1965 mcinnes 1981 lu et al 2007 lu et al 2019 or commercially available sensors nguyen et al 2017 2 water content θ was measured by time domain reflectometry tdr thermo tdr or by weighing 3 matric potential ψ was measured by a suction table with a hanging water column setup lu et al 2019 sandbox or similar with matric potential sensor nguyen et al 2017 lu et al 2019 pressure plate and dew point potentiometer lu et al 2019 and 4 measurements of λeff θ and ψ were made on the same soil sample the abovementioned data were made either on repacked soil samples al nakshabandi and kohnke 1965 mcinnes 1981 intact samples nguyen et al 2017 or on both lu et al 2019 2 3 performance measure of models the similarity between predicted and actual values of five literature models and the new model was assessed by plotting them on 1 1 diagrams with 10 and 30 lines and by using three metrics 1 root mean square error rmse 8 rmse j 1 n y j y j 2 n 2 average deviation ad 9 ad 1 n i 1 n y j y j and 3 nash sutcliff efficiency nse 10 nse 1 j 1 n y j y j 2 j 1 n y j y 2 where y j is the jth measured value y j is the jth predicted value y is the mean of measured values and n is the number of measured values nse 1 indicates perfect match between y j and y j nse 0 indicates y j is accurate as y while nse 0 indicates y is a better predictor rmse indicates the absolute difference between y j and y j the closer of rmse value to zero the better of the predictor 3 results and discussion 3 1 model development and determination of parameters fig 1 shows three approaches to express the relationship between λeff and water status use of model form of λeff sr fig 1b provides additional information on porosity p compared to λeff θ relationships fig 1a which in turn provides additional information on bulk density ρb compared to the traditional model form of λeff θg kersten 1949 because the conversion relationships of θ θg ρb and sr θ p however none of the λeff sr λeff θ or λeff θg relationships can be applied universally they may only work well on certain soil types or water content range cheng and hsu 1999 lu and dong 2015 he et al 2020 wang et al 2020a wang et al 2020b while the λeff ψ relationship can provide additional information on energy states which make the changes of λeff ψ more sensitive than that of λeff θ and λeff sr the span of λeff is significantly narrowed for soils from clay to sand fig 1c vs a and b this unique feature of λeff ψ may explain the development of the soil independent mp1981 model mccumber and pielke 1981 for a wide range of applications however unsatisfactory estimation of λeff from ψ peters lidard et al 1998 was generally reported when using λeff ψ relationships chen and dudhia 2001 béhaegel et al 2007 lu et al 2019 a possible explanation is that their dataset is small and measurements were not made across the full range of matric potential e g fig 1c the inclusion of λeff measurements at pf 2 makes the λeff ψ relationship more complicated lu et al 2019 however a closer check reveals that the λeff ψ at pf 2 could be the porosity or bulk density dependent saturated soil thermal conductivity λsat that varies from soil to soil the dotted purple lines fig 2 indicates that they are the possible plateaus of the λeff ψ before the air entry point ψb determination of ψb has been well documented for soil water retention characteristics brooks and corey 1964 hadas 1987 nemati et al 2002 slowik et al 2008 sakaki et al 2014 regressing λeff ψ data at pf ψb results in a power function relationship with r2 0 92 11 λ eff ψ λ sat 5 2522 p f 1 731 pf ψ b p f ψ b a b where saturated soil thermal conductivity λsat can be determined experimentally he et al 2018b empirically or easily calculated yan et al 2019 wang et al 2020b 3 2 test of λeff ψ model on independent measurements fig 3 shows the comparison of the six models on ls2019 soils f1 f5 that sampled at various times at the field sites after rainfall events and they also varied in soil texture structure water content organic matter content and bulk densities lu et al 2019 the ls2019 model performed the best on this dataset followed by the new model which slightly underestimated the measurements but within an acceptable range 30 and performed much better than the four remaining models i e mp1981 mccumber and pielke 1981 rc1996 reece 1996 nc2003 nichol et al 2003 and ke2018 kroener et al 2018 the less satisfactory performance of the new model may result from 1 the effects of hysteresis from different wetting drying curves the effects of hysteresis will be further discussed in section 3 3 2 unmatched measurements of λeff and ψ i e the measurements of λeff were taken on ring samples while ψ were taken on subsamples with a wp4 t dewpoint potentiometer in addition the ls2019 was developed for pf 3 while the new model was for the whole range of pf moreover an empirical model with potential for wide applications does not necessarily mean it can be applied universally or suit every soil additional data is required to calibrate or improve the model for application for new soils the same phenomena can be found in modeling of other soil physical properties with empirical relationships such as the widely applied topp et al 1980 equation for determination of soil dielectric permittivity and volumetric water contnet and the van genuchten 1980 equation for determination of soil water retention characteristics nonetheless there is a gap between the available and required measurements of λeff ψ and more discussion pertaining to the data availability can be found in section 3 4 3 3 comparison with other λeff ψ models with the whole dataset fig 4 shows the performance of six λeff ψ models based on the whole dataset in table 2 the new model fig 4f performed best among the six models investigated with overall rmse 0 19 w m 1 c 1 ad 0 04 w m 1 c 1 and nse 0 92 table 2 this is followed by the ls2019 model fig 4e with overall rmse 0 35 w m 1 c 1 ad 0 00 w m 1 c 1 and nse 0 76 the ls2019 model fig 4e performed much better compared to the models of mp1981 rc1996 nc2013 and ke2018 fig 4a d with satisfactory performance on most of the data from ak1965 and ls2007 ls2019 i e 0 λeff 1 5 w m 1 c 1 it underestimated λeff of ls2007 2019 data when λeff 1 5 w m 1 c 1 i e pf 2 and generally overestimated data of mk1981 table 2 the ls2019 model also generally overestimated λeff when ψ ψb symbols in purple this is apparent in table 2 where the nse values are 0 76 and 0 77 for the ak1965 and ls2007 ls2019 dataset respectively the mp1981 model fig 4a performed the worst table 2 and generally overestimated λeff except at range of λeff 1 w m 1 c 1 for the mk1981 data this agrees well with previous studies that reported higher than normal estimates of λeff with the mp1981 model peters lidard et al 1998 chen and dudhia 2001 béhaegel et al 2007 lu et al 2019 the models rc1996 fig 4b and its modified form of nc2003 fig 4c significantly underestimated λeff across the whole ψ range the underlying reason is unknown but may be due to 1 these two models were designed to estimate matric potential from measured thermal conductivity of a porous ceramic that equilibrates with the soils reece 1996 nichol et al 2003 and 2 the low thermal conductivity and a high porosity of the sensor material reece 1996 also reported a measured λeff ranging from 0 67 w m 1 c 1 at pf 2 to 0 25 w m 1 c 1 at pf 4 similarly to rc1996 and nc2013 the ke2018 model fig 4d underestimated λeff which is attributed to the fact that this model was based on the mk1981 data the mk1981 data showed a smaller λeff ψ at ranges from pf 3 to 7 fig 2 right triangles in pink however no information on the measurement errors was given in the original study of mcinnes 1981 and no further analysis could be made lu et al 2019 notably the performance of all five previous models i e mp1981 rc1996 nc2003 ke2018 ls2019 was significantly improved when data less than air entry point were excluded table 2 which indicates that the fundamental limitation of these models to estimate λeff at high water content it is also noted that all the models performed worst on the nv2017 dataset table 2 whether the data greater than air entry point were considered or excluded which might be due to hysteresis associated with the λeff ψ relationship because nguyen et al 2017 measured λeff ψ of a clay on the drying rewetting drying cycles the ls2007 2019 data were measured on the drying curve lu et al 2008 lu et al 2019 while the data of al nakshabandi and kohnke 1965 was possibly measured on the wetting curve according to the description in their original study the effects of hysteresis associated with the data of al nakshabandi and kohnke 1965 remarkably affected the new model at the range 2 5 pf 3 2 for silt loam and fine sand i e five red squares outside of the 30 line in fig 4f the range of pf 2 5 3 2 is mainly controlled by the funicular regime that is most sensitive to hysteresis than the other soil water retention regimes e g capillary and hydration regimes hysteresis was found to be critical to interpret the difference in hydraulic properties basile et al 2003 modeling of hysteresis on soil water retention characteristics has been well documented pham et al 2005 abbasi et al 2012 likos et al 2014 however few studies pertaining to hysteresis effects on frozen soil λeff as a function of temperature exist suzuki et al 2002 zhang et al 2018b and no such study was found for modeling λeff ψ therefore future studies on this topic are recommended 3 4 limitations of the λeff ψ model and perspective on future studies as an empirical model the overall performance of the new model is satisfactory for the full range of matric potential compared to five other models it should be noted that the empirical model theoretically cannot be extrapolated to soil types other than those used for the development of the model he et al 2017 calibration with a larger dataset would potentially improve the model for more accurate and wider applications he et al 2017 yan et al 2019 however despite the fact that the λeff ψ relationship could be applied widely for studies of coupled water and heat transport and associated numerical simulations there is a lack of experimental measurements of λeff ψ campbell 1988 lu et al 2019 compared to available measurements of λeff θ or hydraulic properties leij 1996 nemes et al 2001 nemes 2002 this lack of experimental data may be due to the fact that it is time consuming and laborious to take these measurements in practice no single method can be used to measure λeff ψ across the full matric potential range and multiple methods apparatus are required for instance use of the hanging water column method to measure λeff ψ at pf 2 requires a pressure plate for 2 pf 4 and a dew point potentiometer for pf 4 dane and hopmans 2002 lu et al 2008 lu et al 2014 lu et al 2019 nonetheless in order to fill the knowledge gap future studies that aim to take λeff ψ measurements across full range of matric potential on soils with various texture classes organic matter content and bulk densities are highly recommended in theory a quantitative relationship can be established using a similar approach used to study the effects of air entry and hysteresis for soil water retention characteristics if more measurements are available brooks and corey 1964 hadas 1987 nemati et al 2002 pham et al 2005 slowik et al 2008 abbasi et al 2012 likos et al 2014 sakaki et al 2014 moreover similar to standardized procedures to measure thermal conductivity of soil and rocks e g astm d5334 14 standard test method for determination of thermal conductivity of soil and soft rock by thermal needle probe procedure and ieee std 442 2017 ieee draft guide for thermal resistivity measurements of soils and backfill materials protocols should be established for λeff ψ measurements for quality control purposes he et al 2018a he et al 2018b 4 conclusion this study proposed a new λeff ψ model for predicting effective soil thermal conductivity from matric potential the new model has potential for wide applications across the full range of matric potential however there is a lack of experimental measurements of λeff ψ to further validate and calibrate this model future efforts on measurements of λeff ψ should be conducted and studies that investigate the effects of air entry point and hysteresis on the behavior of λeff ψ are recommended credit authorship contribution statement hailong he

soil thermal conductivity noborio and mcinnes 1993 abu hamdeh and reeder 2000 wang et al 2019 water content has been proved to play a vital role in determining the magnitude of λeff johansen 1975

matric suction ψ the negative of matric potential predictive models of λeff can also be based on them these soil thermal conductivity models are also referred as porosity or saturation dependent models ghanbarian et al 2015 ghanbarian and daigle 2016 sadeghi et al 2018 or thermal conductivity dry out curves in engineering smits et al 2010 likos 2014 wu et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 numerous predictive models for soil thermal conductivity are available in the literature cheng and hsu 1999 dong et al 2015 zhang et al 2018a he et al 2020 wang et al 2020a but a majority of them are based on volumetric water content θ or λeff θ relationship de vries 1963 he et al 2017 gravimetric water content θg or λeff θg relationship kersten 1949 or degree of saturation sr or λeff sr relationship johansen 1975 côté and konrad 2005 only a few predictive models of λeff were developed by relating λeff to soil independent matric potential ψ or hereafter referred to as λeff ψ relationships mccumber and pielke 1981 reece 1996 nichol et al 2003 kroener et al 2018 lu et al 2019 the virtue of the λeff ψ relationship is that it accounts for soil pore size distribution and geometry and it enables the study of coupled water and heat transport in soil the first example of λeff ψ relationships is the model of mccumber and pielke 1981 hereafter mp1981 which is one of the most widely applied soil thermal conductivity models the mp1981 model has been incorporated in over 10 hydrological models land surface models earth system models and climate models including ecmwf eta lss isba leaf olam ncep noah osu caps svats uvmm wrf to predict soil temperature and surface heat flux noilhan and mahfouf 1996 smirnova et al 1997 chen and dudhia 2001 fernando et al 2013 massey et al 2014 however a large discrepancy was found between the measured and predicted λeff ψ peters lidard et al 1998 and even physically unreasonable estimates of λeff ψ at high ψ range were reported chen and dudhia 2001 béhaegel et al 2007 lu et al 2019 the unsatisfactory performance of mp1981 model may be attributed to a lack of measurements of λeff ψ the empirical thermal conductivity models cannot be extrapolated for applications beyond soil types or water content range used to develop the model he et al 2017 only a small dataset of al nakshabandi and kohnke 1965 consisting of three soils i e fine sand silt loam and clay were used to develop the mp1981 model in addition the λeff ψ were not measured across the full matric potential range i e 2 1 pf 7 pf lg ψ the common logarithm of ψ in cm for fine sand pf 2 9 pf 7 for silt loam and 3 8 pf 7 for clay moreover the data points of λeff ψ were possibly not measured on the same sample for each soil because varied bulk densities were given no details on the measurements were found in the paper i e 1 40 1 43 g cm 3 for fine sand 1 15 1 30 g cm 3 for silt loam and 0 89 1 00 g cm 3 for clay al nakshabandi and kohnke 1965 based on a much larger dataset with λeff and ψ measured on the same soil samples lu et al 2019 proposed a new model similar to that of mp1981 hereafter ls2019 the ls2019 model significantly improved the ability of predicting the λeff ψ relationship compared to the mp1981 model however the ls2019 model is limited to pf 3 and variations still exist between the modeled and measured λeff ψ because they found a highly nonlinear λeff ψ relationship and it varied strongly with soil texture and bulk density the objective of this study was to develop a new λeff ψ model that can be used to estimate λeff across the full range of matric potential a performance comparison was made between the proposed new model and other λeff ψ models available in the literature with published dataset 2 material and methods 2 1 predictive models for estimating λeff ψ 2 1 1 mccumber and pielke 1981 mp1981 model based on experimental measurements on three soils i e clay silt loam and fine sand made by al nakshabandi and kohnke 1965 mccumber and pielke 1981 developed an exponential relationship between λeff and soil matric potential 1 λ eff 418 4 exp p f 2 7 0 1715 pf 5 1 p f 5 1 a b where the coefficient 418 4 is used to convert cal s 1 cm 1 c 1 to si unit w m 1 c 1 and ψ is soil water matric potential cm h2o and pf lg ψ is the common logarithm of ψ in cm a single probe heat pulse sphp probe was used to measure λeff the mp1981 assumed that ψ θ was nearly independent of soil texture class 2 1 2 reece 1996 rc1996 model reece 1996 developed a λeff ψ relationship for measuring ψ with a line heat dissipation sensor which consisted of a sphp probe embedded in a cylindrical porous ceramic 2 λ eff λ dry s e n s o r 1 a 1 a 2 ln 10 10 pf 1 where 10 10pf is used to convert pf back to j kg 1 to keep constant with the original study fitting parameters a1 0 032 and a2 0 127 r2 0 996 were suggested in the original work λdry sensor is the thermal conductivity of ceramic sensor body when no water exists eq 2 was slightly different from eqs 9 and 10 in reece 1996 because it was expressed as relative thermal resistivity m k w 1 as a function of matric potential j kg 1 2 1 3 nichol et al 2003 nc2003 model nichol et al 2003 proposed an equation accounting for the effects of soil thermal conductivity stc sensors on the measured λeff 3 λ eff t ψ λ dry s e n s o r f ψ λ w t where λdry sensor is the thermal conductivity of ceramic sensor body when no water exists nichol et al 2003 used λdry sensor 0 15 w m 1 c 1 based on study of shuai et al 1998 f ψ is the fractional contribution of water as a function of matric potential to λeff eq 2 of reece 1996 and shuai et al 1998 was used the λ w t is temperature dependent thermal conductivity of water for calculating the temperature correction for different matric potentials nichol et al 2003 λ w t is calculated by 4 λ w t 8 10 6 t 2 0 002 t 0 5607 where t is temperature c 2 1 4 kroener et al 2018 ke2018 model kroener et al 2018 developed an λeff ψ relationship based on five soils i e quincy fine sand ritzville silt loam walla walla silt loam palouse silt loam and naff silt loam of mcinnes 1981 and campbell 1988 5 λ eff 1 28 1 14 1 10 pf 22 7 0 588 the constants in eq 5 are fitting parameters the ke2018 model produced an s shaped λeff ψ and it also assumed that the λeff ψ relationship is independent of soil texture similar to the mp1981 model 2 1 5 lu et al 2019 ls2019 model lu et al 2019 proposed an exponential relationship to predict λeff for pf 3 based on measurement of repacked and intact samples 6 λ eff exp 1 12 0 38 p f the constants in eq 6 are fitting parameters 2 1 6 new model previous studies showed that it is possible to obtain a nearly soil texture independent λeff ψ relationship but they generally failed to model λeff at high soil matric potential i e high water content the exponential functions they used can only capture the exponential increase of soil water content and λeff as of function of matric potential at the first three soil water retention regimes of hydration i e water attracted by intermolecular forces provided by van der waals attraction cations and anions or hydrogen bond of water pendular i e water froms discrete menisci near particle contacts and funicular i e menisci are interconnected to each other however the water content and λeff remain little change at the capillary regime i e air phase become occluded bubbles or when matric potential is less than the air entry point likos 2014 lu and dong 2015 he et al 2017 therefore the exponential function alone cannot simulate the sigmoidal shape of λeff ψ across the full range of matric potential or all four soil water retention regimes given the similarity between λeff ψ and soil water retention characteristics we proposed an air entry point ψb dependent two segmented functions 7 λ eff ψ λ sat a 1 p f a 2 pf ψ b p f ψ b a b where a1 and a2 are fitting parameters that are associated with a power function in eq 7b 2 2 data collection and analysis simultaneous measurements of λeff θ and ψ were made on the same sample intact or repacked providing a unique opportunity to analyze the λeff ψ relationship an extensive literature search showed that only a few such studies were conducted over the past decades 1960s to 2020 measured λeff ψ on 26 soils from five studies were obtained by digitizing the figures and tables in the literature or by personal communications al nakshabandi and kohnke 1965 mcinnes 1981 lu et al 2007 nguyen et al 2017 lu et al 2019 the selected soil physical properties were tabulated table 1 and detailed descriptions of the experimental setup can be found in the respective studies a brief introduction of the measurement methods for the compiled dataset is given below 1 λeff was measured with the transient heat pulse method including the single probe heat pulse sphp and the dual probe heat pulse method dphp with customized al nakshabandi and kohnke 1965 mcinnes 1981 lu et al 2007 lu et al 2019 or commercially available sensors nguyen et al 2017 2 water content θ was measured by time domain reflectometry tdr thermo tdr or by weighing 3 matric potential ψ was measured by a suction table with a hanging water column setup lu et al 2019 sandbox or similar with matric potential sensor nguyen et al 2017 lu et al 2019 pressure plate and dew point potentiometer lu et al 2019 and 4 measurements of λeff θ and ψ were made on the same soil sample the abovementioned data were made either on repacked soil samples al nakshabandi and kohnke 1965 mcinnes 1981 intact samples nguyen et al 2017 or on both lu et al 2019 2 3 performance measure of models the similarity between predicted and actual values of five literature models and the new model was assessed by plotting them on 1 1 diagrams with 10 and 30 lines and by using three metrics 1 root mean square error rmse 8 rmse j 1 n y j y j 2 n 2 average deviation ad 9 ad 1 n i 1 n y j y j and 3 nash sutcliff efficiency nse 10 nse 1 j 1 n y j y j 2 j 1 n y j y 2 where y j is the jth measured value y j is the jth predicted value y is the mean of measured values and n is the number of measured values nse 1 indicates perfect match between y j and y j nse 0 indicates y j is accurate as y while nse 0 indicates y is a better predictor rmse indicates the absolute difference between y j and y j the closer of rmse value to zero the better of the predictor 3 results and discussion 3 1 model development and determination of parameters fig 1 shows three approaches to express the relationship between λeff and water status use of model form of λeff sr fig 1b provides additional information on porosity p compared to λeff θ relationships fig 1a which in turn provides additional information on bulk density ρb compared to the traditional model form of λeff θg kersten 1949 because the conversion relationships of θ θg ρb and sr θ p however none of the λeff sr λeff θ or λeff θg relationships can be applied universally they may only work well on certain soil types or water content range cheng and hsu 1999 lu and dong 2015 he et al 2020 wang et al 2020a wang et al 2020b while the λeff ψ relationship can provide additional information on energy states which make the changes of λeff ψ more sensitive than that of λeff θ and λeff sr the span of λeff is significantly narrowed for soils from clay to sand fig 1c vs a and b this unique feature of λeff ψ may explain the development of the soil independent mp1981 model mccumber and pielke 1981 for a wide range of applications however unsatisfactory estimation of λeff from ψ peters lidard et al 1998 was generally reported when using λeff ψ relationships chen and dudhia 2001 béhaegel et al 2007 lu et al 2019 a possible explanation is that their dataset is small and measurements were not made across the full range of matric potential e g fig 1c the inclusion of λeff measurements at pf 2 makes the λeff ψ relationship more complicated lu et al 2019 however a closer check reveals that the λeff ψ at pf 2 could be the porosity or bulk density dependent saturated soil thermal conductivity λsat that varies from soil to soil the dotted purple lines fig 2 indicates that they are the possible plateaus of the λeff ψ before the air entry point ψb determination of ψb has been well documented for soil water retention characteristics brooks and corey 1964 hadas 1987 nemati et al 2002 slowik et al 2008 sakaki et al 2014 regressing λeff ψ data at pf ψb results in a power function relationship with r2 0 92 11 λ eff ψ λ sat 5 2522 p f 1 731 pf ψ b p f ψ b a b where saturated soil thermal conductivity λsat can be determined experimentally he et al 2018b empirically or easily calculated yan et al 2019 wang et al 2020b 3 2 test of λeff ψ model on independent measurements fig 3 shows the comparison of the six models on ls2019 soils f1 f5 that sampled at various times at the field sites after rainfall events and they also varied in soil texture structure water content organic matter content and bulk densities lu et al 2019 the ls2019 model performed the best on this dataset followed by the new model which slightly underestimated the measurements but within an acceptable range 30 and performed much better than the four remaining models i e mp1981 mccumber and pielke 1981 rc1996 reece 1996 nc2003 nichol et al 2003 and ke2018 kroener et al 2018 the less satisfactory performance of the new model may result from 1 the effects of hysteresis from different wetting drying curves the effects of hysteresis will be further discussed in section 3 3 2 unmatched measurements of λeff and ψ i e the measurements of λeff were taken on ring samples while ψ were taken on subsamples with a wp4 t dewpoint potentiometer in addition the ls2019 was developed for pf 3 while the new model was for the whole range of pf moreover an empirical model with potential for wide applications does not necessarily mean it can be applied universally or suit every soil additional data is required to calibrate or improve the model for application for new soils the same phenomena can be found in modeling of other soil physical properties with empirical relationships such as the widely applied topp et al 1980 equation for determination of soil dielectric permittivity and volumetric water contnet and the van genuchten 1980 equation for determination of soil water retention characteristics nonetheless there is a gap between the available and required measurements of λeff ψ and more discussion pertaining to the data availability can be found in section 3 4 3 3 comparison with other λeff ψ models with the whole dataset fig 4 shows the performance of six λeff ψ models based on the whole dataset in table 2 the new model fig 4f performed best among the six models investigated with overall rmse 0 19 w m 1 c 1 ad 0 04 w m 1 c 1 and nse 0 92 table 2 this is followed by the ls2019 model fig 4e with overall rmse 0 35 w m 1 c 1 ad 0 00 w m 1 c 1 and nse 0 76 the ls2019 model fig 4e performed much better compared to the models of mp1981 rc1996 nc2013 and ke2018 fig 4a d with satisfactory performance on most of the data from ak1965 and ls2007 ls2019 i e 0 λeff 1 5 w m 1 c 1 it underestimated λeff of ls2007 2019 data when λeff 1 5 w m 1 c 1 i e pf 2 and generally overestimated data of mk1981 table 2 the ls2019 model also generally overestimated λeff when ψ ψb symbols in purple this is apparent in table 2 where the nse values are 0 76 and 0 77 for the ak1965 and ls2007 ls2019 dataset respectively the mp1981 model fig 4a performed the worst table 2 and generally overestimated λeff except at range of λeff 1 w m 1 c 1 for the mk1981 data this agrees well with previous studies that reported higher than normal estimates of λeff with the mp1981 model peters lidard et al 1998 chen and dudhia 2001 béhaegel et al 2007 lu et al 2019 the models rc1996 fig 4b and its modified form of nc2003 fig 4c significantly underestimated λeff across the whole ψ range the underlying reason is unknown but may be due to 1 these two models were designed to estimate matric potential from measured thermal conductivity of a porous ceramic that equilibrates with the soils reece 1996 nichol et al 2003 and 2 the low thermal conductivity and a high porosity of the sensor material reece 1996 also reported a measured λeff ranging from 0 67 w m 1 c 1 at pf 2 to 0 25 w m 1 c 1 at pf 4 similarly to rc1996 and nc2013 the ke2018 model fig 4d underestimated λeff which is attributed to the fact that this model was based on the mk1981 data the mk1981 data showed a smaller λeff ψ at ranges from pf 3 to 7 fig 2 right triangles in pink however no information on the measurement errors was given in the original study of mcinnes 1981 and no further analysis could be made lu et al 2019 notably the performance of all five previous models i e mp1981 rc1996 nc2003 ke2018 ls2019 was significantly improved when data less than air entry point were excluded table 2 which indicates that the fundamental limitation of these models to estimate λeff at high water content it is also noted that all the models performed worst on the nv2017 dataset table 2 whether the data greater than air entry point were considered or excluded which might be due to hysteresis associated with the λeff ψ relationship because nguyen et al 2017 measured λeff ψ of a clay on the drying rewetting drying cycles the ls2007 2019 data were measured on the drying curve lu et al 2008 lu et al 2019 while the data of al nakshabandi and kohnke 1965 was possibly measured on the wetting curve according to the description in their original study the effects of hysteresis associated with the data of al nakshabandi and kohnke 1965 remarkably affected the new model at the range 2 5 pf 3 2 for silt loam and fine sand i e five red squares outside of the 30 line in fig 4f the range of pf 2 5 3 2 is mainly controlled by the funicular regime that is most sensitive to hysteresis than the other soil water retention regimes e g capillary and hydration regimes hysteresis was found to be critical to interpret the difference in hydraulic properties basile et al 2003 modeling of hysteresis on soil water retention characteristics has been well documented pham et al 2005 abbasi et al 2012 likos et al 2014 however few studies pertaining to hysteresis effects on frozen soil λeff as a function of temperature exist suzuki et al 2002 zhang et al 2018b and no such study was found for modeling λeff ψ therefore future studies on this topic are recommended 3 4 limitations of the λeff ψ model and perspective on future studies as an empirical model the overall performance of the new model is satisfactory for the full range of matric potential compared to five other models it should be noted that the empirical model theoretically cannot be extrapolated to soil types other than those used for the development of the model he et al 2017 calibration with a larger dataset would potentially improve the model for more accurate and wider applications he et al 2017 yan et al 2019 however despite the fact that the λeff ψ relationship could be applied widely for studies of coupled water and heat transport and associated numerical simulations there is a lack of experimental measurements of λeff ψ campbell 1988 lu et al 2019 compared to available measurements of λeff θ or hydraulic properties leij 1996 nemes et al 2001 nemes 2002 this lack of experimental data may be due to the fact that it is time consuming and laborious to take these measurements in practice no single method can be used to measure λeff ψ across the full matric potential range and multiple methods apparatus are required for instance use of the hanging water column method to measure λeff ψ at pf 2 requires a pressure plate for 2 pf 4 and a dew point potentiometer for pf 4 dane and hopmans 2002 lu et al 2008 lu et al 2014 lu et al 2019 nonetheless in order to fill the knowledge gap future studies that aim to take λeff ψ measurements across full range of matric potential on soils with various texture classes organic matter content and bulk densities are highly recommended in theory a quantitative relationship can be established using a similar approach used to study the effects of air entry and hysteresis for soil water retention characteristics if more measurements are available brooks and corey 1964 hadas 1987 nemati et al 2002 pham et al 2005 slowik et al 2008 abbasi et al 2012 likos et al 2014 sakaki et al 2014 moreover similar to standardized procedures to measure thermal conductivity of soil and rocks e g astm d5334 14 standard test method for determination of thermal conductivity of soil and soft rock by thermal needle probe procedure and ieee std 442 2017 ieee draft guide for thermal resistivity measurements of soils and backfill materials protocols should be established for λeff ψ measurements for quality control purposes he et al 2018a he et al 2018b 4 conclusion this study proposed a new λeff ψ model for predicting effective soil thermal conductivity from matric potential the new model has potential for wide applications across the full range of matric potential however there is a lack of experimental measurements of λeff ψ to further validate and calibrate this model future efforts on measurements of λeff ψ should be conducted and studies that investigate the effects of air entry point and hysteresis on the behavior of λeff ψ are recommended credit authorship contribution statement hailong he

5238,peatland ecosystem processes are strongly influenced by hydrology linked to climate change however how transpiration as major water loss pathway in closed peatland responds to climate change and then regulates ecosystem water balance that remains poorly understood here we reported an 18 000 year fossil phytolith record from an herbaceous community dominated mountain peatland in central china to reconstruct climate changes and vegetation evolution and reveal the interactions between regional climate changes and peatland ecosystem the abundance of bulliform phytoliths a silicified type of cells that regulate the movements of plant leaves to reduce light exposure and transpiration rate shows close correlations with the holocene climate variations with higher bulliform abundance in response to warm dry climate 11 500 9600 cal yr bp 7500 3000 cal yr bp and lower values associated with cold wet climate 13 000 11 500 cal yr bp 3000 cal yr bp present spectral analysis reveals that bulliform abundance andreconstructed climate vary with a major 1000 year periodicity during the holocene suggesting a possible causal relationship to solar activity a high bulliform abundance and warm dry climate correspond with enhanced solar activity and vice versa we interpret that the resultant leaf water deficit resulted from greater light interception high temperature anddrought promoted the production of bulliform cells to fold leaf for water conservation which is an effective protective mechanism of peatland grasses from the environmental stress these results expand our understanding of how grass dominated peatland plant water regulation recorded by bulliform phytoliths responds to solar radiation and local hydroclimate during geological period keywords phytolith water regulation 1000 year periodicity solar activity holocene peat central china 1 introduction transpiration representing 80 90 of terrestrial evapotranspiration globally recycles 62000 8000 km3 of water every year from the world s continents to the atmosphere and is an important process responsible for soil water losses daly et al 2004 jasechko et al 2013 moro et al 2004 it also provides vital links between vegetation soil and atmosphere and directly affects plant production yang et al 1990 and ecosystem productivity schlesinger jasechko 2014 peatlands are one of the largest terrestrial biosphere carbon pools containing 500 700 billion tons gt of carbon on only 3 of the earth s land area yu et al 2010 transpiration is the primary hydroclimatic factor influencing peatland ecosystem processes and the carbon cycle as enhanced transpiration can trigger a decrease in the peatland water table leading to the decomposition of organic matter and the release of carbon to the atmosphere cubasch et al 2001 a model simulation in northern manitoba canada showed that an experimental warming of 4 c could cause an abrupt decline in depth to water table dwt the depth from the peat surface to the water table 40 loss of organic carbon from the shallow peats and 86 from the deep peats ise et al 2008 therefore transpiration related with temperature is an important environmental variable affecting peatlands hydrological processes exploring transpiration processes under the background of past hydroclimatic changes is therefore crucial for understanding peatland vegetation dynamics ecohydrology carbon cycle and predicting the peatland s response to global climate change peatland plants such as cyperaceae sedges and poaceae grasses produce phytoliths notably in the bulliform cells supplementary fig 1 of their epidermis metcalfe 1960 parry smithson 1958 bulliform cells are involved in rolling and unrolling of the leaves a mechanism that protects the leaf from overheating and dehydration by reducing the transpiring surface and minimizing light exposure and water transpiration in unfavourable conditions clarke 1986 moulia 1994 studies on plant samples showed that abundance of bulliform phytoliths sensitively responds to the plant leaves dehydration induced by aridity issaharou matchi et al 2016 sangster parry 1969 1971 or excessive evaporation novello et al 2012 but palaeo climate responses and impacts on peatland water loss of bulliform cells remain unclear here we present a phytolith record over the past 18 000 cal yr bp derived from a peatland in the shennongjia mountain in central china to examine the interactions among the palaeo transpiration palaeo climate changes and peatland water loss previous studies have shown that phytolith assemblages from 243 surface soil samples along ecological and climatic gradients throughout china can be used to develop phytolith climate transfer functions based on weighted averaging partial least squares regression wa pls to reconstruct temperature and precipitation such transfer functions were applied to the weinan profile in the chinese loess plateau documenting palaeoclimate changes in northern china over the last 136 ka lu et al 2006 2007 using a smaller phytolith dataset of 43 surface soil samples collected along a hydrological gradient throughout dajiuhu peatland another phytolith based transfer function was established to reconstruct dwt variations over the last 13 000 years liu et al 2018 2019 studies of peat phytoliths show that the surface soil phytolith assemblages from different peatlands in northeast of china are influenced by latitudinal gradients of climate guo et al 2012 zhang et al 2007 and temperature and humidity were reconstructed successfully using fossil phytoliths from peat cores li et al 2013a zhang et al 2019 therefore temperature and local hydrology are two important environmental variables closely related to peat phytolith assemblages which can be reconstructed over a long time scale based on the controversy of palaeo hydroclimate since the last deglaciation in study region sun et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 we do extend the study interval from present to 18 000 cal yr bp and attempt to provide new quantified palaeoclimate records over the past 18 000 years based on phytolith database of china lu et al 2006 we also interpret holocene peatland water loss regulated by plant transpiration response to periodical climate changes 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the dajiuhu peatland in central china that covers an area of about 16 km2 is located at an

from china have generally suggested that the period of the warm condition occurred in the early and middle holocene from 10 000 to 3000 cal yr bp xiao et al 2002 zhao et al 2011 despite these differences in absolute temperatures the palaeo temperature pattern inferred from phytoliths has a similar trend to bna15 huang et al 2013a and pollen zhu et al 2008 derived temperature curves in

hydrological changes in dajiuhu peatland liu et al 2019 huang et al 2013b 2018 xie et al 2013 are closely linked with the precipitation changes recorded by stalagmites zhang et al 2018 zhu et al 2017 the postglacial hydrothermal climate patterns of dajiuhu peatland therefore could be summarized as follows an overall cold and slightly wet stage 18 000 13 000 cal yr bp two prominent warm dry stages 11 500 9600 cal yr bp and 7500 3000 cal yr bp two evident cold wet stages 13 000 11 500 cal yr bp and 3000 cal yr bp present and a warm wet stage 9600 7500 cal yr bp fig 3 4 discussion 4 1 regional vegetation history correlated with hydroclimate the vegetation history since the past 18 000 years indicated by phytoliths pollens and biomarkers indicates a mixed forest landscape mainly dominated by coniferous and deciduous broad leaved trees during 18 000 13 000 cal yr bp poaceae mainly pooideae and cyperaceae made great contribution on herbaceous community leaf wax molecular ratios of peat indicated high submerged macrophyte biomass huang et al 2018 and the δ13c values showed a c3 plant dominated vegetation community li et al 2013b corresponding to the cold and slightly wet last deglaciation in dajiuhu peatland evident increases in trilites and poaceae followed by sphagnum were observed since 13 000 cal yr bp which could be correlated with cold wet younger dryas and then peatland expansion li et al 2013b zhu et al 2010 supporting the idea of higher submerged macrophyte biomass at 12 000 10 000 cal yr bp he et al 2015 li et al 2013b since 11 000 cal yr bp mixed forests of warm temperate deciduous and evergreen taxa become more abundant and seem to progressively replace coniferous trees li et al 2013b warmer and wetter conditions indicate the onset of the holocene warmer and drier mid holocence in central china recorded by peats huang et al 2013a b 2018 liu et al 2019 xie et al 2013 zhu et al 2008 and stalagmites zhu et al 2017 occurred at 7500 3000 cal yr bp the warm temperate deciduous and evergreen broadleaved trees became dominant with lower cool temperate taxa and conifers li et al 2013b zhu et al 2010 the proportion of pooideae decreased in poaceae community the terrestrial plant source and lower sphagnum percentage indicate the expansion of terrestrial dominated peat over sphagnum dominated peat he et al 2015 huang et al 2018 after 3000 cal yr bp the major component of regional forests showed a regression of arboreal plants li et al 2013b increasing submerged macrophyte biomass high sphagnum percentage he et al 2015 huang et al 2018 and pooideae percentage were consistent with a cool and wet late holocene therefore the vegetation succession in dajiuhu peatland over the past 18 000 years sensitively responds to the local climate changes the warm temperate deciduous and evergreen broadleaved trees were dominant throughout warm periods and more conifers and deciduous trees were observed during cold periods regarding the herbaceous community cold and wet intervals are inferred from the increased abundance of submerged macrophyte biomass sphagnum and pooideae 4 2 response of peatland plants water regulation to warm dry conditions the occurrence of complex climate patterns in dajiuhu peatland and the water saving physiology of modern bulliform cells provide an opportunity to explore the relationship between peatland water regulation and palaeo climate changes the results indicate that the bulliform abundance and climate changes temperature and hydrology show concordant general trends fig 3 high values corresponded to synchronously high temperature and dry conditions 11 500 9600 cal yr bp and 7500 3000 cal yr bp in contrast to the low values in cold wet conditions between 13 000 11 500 cal yr bp and 3000 cal yr bp present as mentioned above the bulliform cells can reduce the width when the leaf is dehydrated as a reaction of leaf folding response of grasses to moisture loss clarke 1986 moulia 1994 moreover the monitoring results of daily net radiation air temperature and evapotranspiration in the dajiuhu peatland suggest that greater evapotranspiration occurs at a high air temperature and net radiation condition supplementary fig 5 peng et al 2017 so the increased air temperature and insolation during early and middle holocene enhanced transpiration water loss and light exposure of leaf which lead to increased transpiration flow and consequently increased silicification of bulliform cells sangster parry 1971 meanwhile the modern surface soil survey of dajiuhu peatland confirmed that vegetation community changes and increasing bulliform phytoliths occur along with declining water table liu et al 2018 consequently superimposed leaf dehydration induced by coupling of overheat and drought particularly in mid holocene resulted in the loss of pressure potential in the bulliform cells of the upper epidermis moulia 1994 sangster parry 1969 increase in bulliform cells occurred parry smithson 1958 to maintain moisture around stomata and prevent further loss of water to the atmosphere redmann 1985 ristic cass 1991 omarova et al 1995 the cold wet conditions 13 000 11 500 cal yr bp and 3000 cal yr bp present can be just the opposite therefore bulliform abundance discovered in peat sediments may reflect periods when peat plants suffered particular leaf water deficit caused by both the lack of water at the root level hydrology and hot air the close relationship between bulliform abundance and climate over the past 18 000 cal yr bp indicates close correlation between the environmental forcing and plant physiological compensation and provides a historical analogy for predicting how peatland ecosystems may respond to future global warming 4 3 a 1000 year periodicity of plants water regulation and climate change linked to solar activity in order to compare centennial millennial timescale periodical changes between time series of bulliform abundance palaeo climate and solar activity and to further trace the responses of peatland ecosystem to the periodical climate and solar activity over the past 18 000 cal yr bp we performed spectral and wavelet analyses on bulliform abundance palaeo climate and total solar irradiance tsi steinhilber et al 2012 to determine their periods and periodic stabilities fig 4 and supplementary fig 6 the spectral analyses of detrended bulliform abundance palaeo climate and solar activity revealed a millennial cycle of 1000 year oscillations with a confidence level of 95 a further wavelet analysis and filtering analysis showed that the 1000 year quasi periodic oscillations were completely stable and dominant over the past 10 000 years they also showed that the cycles of bulliform abundance and palaeo climate were generally in an in phase relationship with solar activity where higher bulliform abundance palaeo temperature and dwt drier condition were associated with high solar irradiance fig 4 the precipitation variations induced by increased storm frequency probably caused the tiny hydrological shifts at early and late holocene zhu et al 2017 which affect the bulliform abundance oscillations our results certainly indicate a postglacial cold wet and warm dry climate pattern in agreement with previous studies liu et al 2019 rao et al 2016 xiao et al 2002 xiao et al 2015 zhao et al 2011 zhu et al 2017 at millennial timescale highlighting the impacts of boreal summer insolation berger loutre 1991 the asian monsoon climate dykoski et al 2005 hu et al 2008 xie et al 2003 andcoupled ocean atmosphericsystem on hydroclimatic changes in central china liu et al 2019 zhu et al 2017 climate modelling and observation data revealed the mechanism by which solar irradiance triggered the changes in earth surface systems and atmospheric dynamics haigh 1996 if solar irradiance increases the upward propagating effects triggered by changes in the stratospheric ozone cause the warming of the global land surface temperature moreover a previous study interpreted higher dwt drier condition induced by subdued rainfall of central china as the influences of enhanced enso corresponding with increased solar activity zhu et al 2017 alhough the speleothems record from heshang cave in central china shows 500 year storm oscillations during the middle and late holocene however the declined peat accumulation rate induced by drier conditions in mid holocene huang et al 2018 highlighted the millennial oscillations the coupling of high insolation and warm dry climate changes amplified vegetation transpiration and water stress of peatland plant leaves pieruschka et al 2010 damage caused by increased leaf water deficit can be minimized by reducing the effective leaf area consequently high bulliform abundance was induced to fold leaves and reduce the transpiration for conserving scarce water resources and vice versa our study provides new evidence for the influence of 1000 year solar variability on climate and terrestrial ecosystems the solar variability could regulate earth climatic variations and trigger periodic ecological responses in the dajiuhu peatland 5 conclusions holocene hydrological variations of dajiuhu peatland have been further studied and reconstructed based on independent proxies and mainly responded to regional precipitation however transpiration is also responsible for hydrological processes as major water loss pathway of a closed peatland our results show the relationship of the plants physiological compensation and peatland water balance and provide new geological record for occurrence of enhanced ecosystem transpiration under high insolation and temperature conditions therefore the water table drawdown and increased carbon emission of the dajiuhu peatland caused by decreased precipitation in mid holocene might have been amplified by the water loss resulting from enhanced ecosystem transpiration the water deficit induced by high insolation and warm dry climate enhanced leaves water loss strong peatland plants water physiological compensation mechanism was triggered consequently increasing bulliform abundance to fold leaves for reducing the transpiration rate and reserving water resources through creating a micro climate with both humidity and boundary layer resistance near the leaf surfaces which might explain their values plateau in mid holocene the reduction of transpiration rate due to changes in leaf structure not only protects plant tissues from water stress but also diminishes ecosystem water loss rate and relieved peatland drought extent induced by warm dry climate a 1000 year cyclic transpiration and climatic oscillation during the holocene indicates the major influence of periodic solar variability on earth climate and terrestrial ecosystems the relationship was not always in phase since terrestrial ecosystems responded to the superimposed environmental changes which might have interfered slightly the accuracy of geological records as a certain climate factor these findings interpret the interaction of peatland ecosystem and climate change and shed light on the role of solar activity

5238,peatland ecosystem processes are strongly influenced by hydrology linked to climate change however how transpiration as major water loss pathway in closed peatland responds to climate change and then regulates ecosystem water balance that remains poorly understood here we reported an 18 000 year fossil phytolith record from an herbaceous community dominated mountain peatland in central china to reconstruct climate changes and vegetation evolution and reveal the interactions between regional climate changes and peatland ecosystem the abundance of bulliform phytoliths a silicified type of cells that regulate the movements of plant leaves to reduce light exposure and transpiration rate shows close correlations with the holocene climate variations with higher bulliform abundance in response to warm dry climate 11 500 9600 cal yr bp 7500 3000 cal yr bp and lower values associated with cold wet climate 13 000 11 500 cal yr bp 3000 cal yr bp present spectral analysis reveals that bulliform abundance andreconstructed climate vary with a major 1000 year periodicity during the holocene suggesting a possible causal relationship to solar activity a high bulliform abundance and warm dry climate correspond with enhanced solar activity and vice versa we interpret that the resultant leaf water deficit resulted from greater light interception high temperature anddrought promoted the production of bulliform cells to fold leaf for water conservation which is an effective protective mechanism of peatland grasses from the environmental stress these results expand our understanding of how grass dominated peatland plant water regulation recorded by bulliform phytoliths responds to solar radiation and local hydroclimate during geological period keywords phytolith water regulation 1000 year periodicity solar activity holocene peat central china 1 introduction transpiration representing 80 90 of terrestrial evapotranspiration globally recycles 62000 8000 km3 of water every year from the world s continents to the atmosphere and is an important process responsible for soil water losses daly et al 2004 jasechko et al 2013 moro et al 2004 it also provides vital links between vegetation soil and atmosphere and directly affects plant production yang et al 1990 and ecosystem productivity schlesinger jasechko 2014 peatlands are one of the largest terrestrial biosphere carbon pools containing 500 700 billion tons gt of carbon on only 3 of the earth s land area yu et al 2010 transpiration is the primary hydroclimatic factor influencing peatland ecosystem processes and the carbon cycle as enhanced transpiration can trigger a decrease in the peatland water table leading to the decomposition of organic matter and the release of carbon to the atmosphere cubasch et al 2001 a model simulation in northern manitoba canada showed that an experimental warming of 4 c could cause an abrupt decline in depth to water table dwt the depth from the peat surface to the water table 40 loss of organic carbon from the shallow peats and 86 from the deep peats ise et al 2008 therefore transpiration related with temperature is an important environmental variable affecting peatlands hydrological processes exploring transpiration processes under the background of past hydroclimatic changes is therefore crucial for understanding peatland vegetation dynamics ecohydrology carbon cycle and predicting the peatland s response to global climate change peatland plants such as cyperaceae sedges and poaceae grasses produce phytoliths notably in the bulliform cells supplementary fig 1 of their epidermis metcalfe 1960 parry smithson 1958 bulliform cells are involved in rolling and unrolling of the leaves a mechanism that protects the leaf from overheating and dehydration by reducing the transpiring surface and minimizing light exposure and water transpiration in unfavourable conditions clarke 1986 moulia 1994 studies on plant samples showed that abundance of bulliform phytoliths sensitively responds to the plant leaves dehydration induced by aridity issaharou matchi et al 2016 sangster parry 1969 1971 or excessive evaporation novello et al 2012 but palaeo climate responses and impacts on peatland water loss of bulliform cells remain unclear here we present a phytolith record over the past 18 000 cal yr bp derived from a peatland in the shennongjia mountain in central china to examine the interactions among the palaeo transpiration palaeo climate changes and peatland water loss previous studies have shown that phytolith assemblages from 243 surface soil samples along ecological and climatic gradients throughout china can be used to develop phytolith climate transfer functions based on weighted averaging partial least squares regression wa pls to reconstruct temperature and precipitation such transfer functions were applied to the weinan profile in the chinese loess plateau documenting palaeoclimate changes in northern china over the last 136 ka lu et al 2006 2007 using a smaller phytolith dataset of 43 surface soil samples collected along a hydrological gradient throughout dajiuhu peatland another phytolith based transfer function was established to reconstruct dwt variations over the last 13 000 years liu et al 2018 2019 studies of peat phytoliths show that the surface soil phytolith assemblages from different peatlands in northeast of china are influenced by latitudinal gradients of climate guo et al 2012 zhang et al 2007 and temperature and humidity were reconstructed successfully using fossil phytoliths from peat cores li et al 2013a zhang et al 2019 therefore temperature and local hydrology are two important environmental variables closely related to peat phytolith assemblages which can be reconstructed over a long time scale based on the controversy of palaeo hydroclimate since the last deglaciation in study region sun et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 we do extend the study interval from present to 18 000 cal yr bp and attempt to provide new quantified palaeoclimate records over the past 18 000 years based on phytolith database of china lu et al 2006 we also interpret holocene peatland water loss regulated by plant transpiration response to periodical climate changes 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the dajiuhu peatland in central china that covers an area of about 16 km2 is located at an

the warm temperate deciduous and evergreen broadleaved trees became dominant with lower cool temperate taxa and conifers li et al 2013b zhu et al 2010 the proportion of pooideae decreased in poaceae community the terrestrial plant source and lower sphagnum percentage indicate the expansion of terrestrial dominated peat over sphagnum dominated peat he et al 2015 huang et al 2018 after 3000 cal yr bp the major component of regional forests showed a regression of arboreal plants li et al 2013b increasing submerged macrophyte biomass high sphagnum percentage he et al 2015 huang et al 2018 and pooideae percentage were consistent with a cool and wet late holocene therefore the vegetation succession in dajiuhu peatland over the past 18 000 years sensitively responds to the local climate changes the warm temperate deciduous and evergreen broadleaved trees were dominant throughout warm periods and more conifers and deciduous trees were observed during cold periods regarding the herbaceous community cold and wet intervals are inferred from the increased abundance of submerged macrophyte biomass sphagnum and pooideae 4 2 response of peatland plants water regulation to warm dry conditions the occurrence of complex climate patterns in dajiuhu peatland and the water saving physiology of modern bulliform cells provide an opportunity to explore the relationship between peatland water regulation and palaeo climate changes the results indicate that the bulliform abundance and climate changes temperature and hydrology show concordant general trends fig 3 high values corresponded to synchronously high temperature and dry conditions 11 500 9600 cal yr bp and 7500 3000 cal yr bp in contrast to the low values in cold wet conditions between 13 000 11 500 cal yr bp and 3000 cal yr bp present as mentioned above the bulliform cells can reduce the width when the leaf is dehydrated as a reaction of leaf folding response of grasses to moisture loss clarke 1986 moulia 1994 moreover the monitoring results of daily net radiation air temperature and evapotranspiration in the dajiuhu peatland suggest that greater evapotranspiration occurs at a high air temperature and net radiation condition supplementary fig 5 peng et al 2017 so the increased air temperature and insolation during early and middle holocene enhanced transpiration water loss and light exposure of leaf which lead to increased transpiration flow and consequently increased silicification of bulliform cells sangster parry 1971 meanwhile the modern surface soil survey of dajiuhu peatland confirmed that vegetation community changes and increasing bulliform phytoliths occur along with declining water table liu et al 2018 consequently superimposed leaf dehydration induced by coupling of overheat and drought particularly in mid holocene resulted in the loss of pressure potential in the bulliform cells of the upper epidermis moulia 1994 sangster parry 1969 increase in bulliform cells occurred parry smithson 1958 to maintain moisture around stomata and prevent further loss of water to the atmosphere redmann 1985 ristic cass 1991 omarova et al 1995 the cold wet conditions 13 000 11 500 cal yr bp and 3000 cal yr bp present can be just the opposite therefore bulliform abundance discovered in peat sediments may reflect periods when peat plants suffered particular leaf water deficit caused by both the lack of water at the root level hydrology and hot air the close relationship between bulliform abundance and climate over the past 18 000 cal yr bp indicates close correlation between the environmental forcing and plant physiological compensation and provides a historical analogy for predicting how peatland ecosystems may respond to future global warming 4 3 a 1000 year periodicity of plants water regulation and climate change linked to solar activity in order to compare centennial millennial timescale periodical changes between time series of bulliform abundance palaeo climate and solar activity and to further trace the responses of peatland ecosystem to the periodical climate and solar activity over the past 18 000 cal yr bp we performed spectral and wavelet analyses on bulliform abundance palaeo climate and total solar irradiance tsi steinhilber et al 2012 to determine their periods and periodic stabilities fig 4 and supplementary fig 6 the spectral analyses of detrended bulliform abundance palaeo climate and solar activity revealed a millennial cycle of 1000 year oscillations with a confidence level of 95 a further wavelet analysis and filtering analysis showed that the 1000 year quasi periodic oscillations were completely stable and dominant over the past 10 000 years they also showed that the cycles of bulliform abundance and palaeo climate were generally in an in phase relationship with solar activity where higher bulliform abundance palaeo temperature and dwt drier condition were associated with high solar irradiance fig 4 the precipitation variations induced by increased storm frequency probably caused the tiny hydrological shifts at early and late holocene zhu et al 2017 which affect the bulliform abundance oscillations our results certainly indicate a postglacial cold wet and warm dry climate pattern in agreement with previous studies liu et al 2019 rao et al 2016 xiao et al 2002 xiao et al 2015 zhao et al 2011 zhu et al 2017 at millennial timescale highlighting the impacts of boreal summer insolation berger loutre 1991 the asian monsoon climate dykoski et al 2005 hu et al 2008 xie et al 2003 andcoupled ocean atmosphericsystem on hydroclimatic changes in central china liu et al 2019 zhu et al 2017 climate modelling and observation data revealed the mechanism by which solar irradiance triggered the changes in earth surface systems and atmospheric dynamics haigh 1996 if solar irradiance increases the upward propagating effects triggered by changes in the stratospheric ozone cause the warming of the global land surface temperature moreover a previous study interpreted higher dwt drier condition induced by subdued rainfall of central china as the influences of enhanced enso corresponding with increased solar activity zhu et al 2017 alhough the speleothems record from heshang cave in central china shows 500 year storm oscillations during the middle and late holocene however the declined peat accumulation rate induced by drier conditions in mid holocene huang et al 2018 highlighted the millennial oscillations the coupling of high insolation and warm dry climate changes amplified vegetation transpiration and water stress of peatland plant leaves pieruschka et al 2010 damage caused by increased leaf water deficit can be minimized by reducing the effective leaf area consequently high bulliform abundance was induced to fold leaves and reduce the transpiration for conserving scarce water resources and vice versa our study provides new evidence for the influence of 1000 year solar variability on climate and terrestrial ecosystems the solar variability could regulate earth climatic variations and trigger periodic ecological responses in the dajiuhu peatland 5 conclusions holocene hydrological variations of dajiuhu peatland have been further studied and reconstructed based on independent proxies and mainly responded to regional precipitation however transpiration is also responsible for hydrological processes as major water loss pathway of a closed peatland our results show the relationship of the plants physiological compensation and peatland water balance and provide new geological record for occurrence of enhanced ecosystem transpiration under high insolation and temperature conditions therefore the water table drawdown and increased carbon emission of the dajiuhu peatland caused by decreased precipitation in mid holocene might have been amplified by the water loss resulting from enhanced ecosystem transpiration the water deficit induced by high insolation and warm dry climate enhanced leaves water loss strong peatland plants water physiological compensation mechanism was triggered consequently increasing bulliform abundance to fold leaves for reducing the transpiration rate and reserving water resources through creating a micro climate with both humidity and boundary layer resistance near the leaf surfaces which might explain their values plateau in mid holocene the reduction of transpiration rate due to changes in leaf structure not only protects plant tissues from water stress but also diminishes ecosystem water loss rate and relieved peatland drought extent induced by warm dry climate a 1000 year cyclic transpiration and climatic oscillation during the holocene indicates the major influence of periodic solar variability on earth climate and terrestrial ecosystems the relationship was not always in phase since terrestrial ecosystems responded to the superimposed environmental changes which might have interfered slightly the accuracy of geological records as a certain climate factor these findings interpret the interaction of peatland ecosystem and climate change and shed light on the role of solar activity

product the evaluation is performed using in situ measurements for 2013 2015 and one month standardized precipitation index spi 1 for 1982 2016 focusing on four major river basins in south korea the kldas outperforms all benchmark products in capturing soil moisture states and variability at a basin scale compared to gldas and fldas products the eas cci product is not feasible for long term

south korea keywords agricultural drought soil moisture precipitation land surface model 1 introduction drought is commonly characterized by the deficits of hydrologic budget variables i e precipitation soil moisture groundwater evapotranspiration and streamflow from average conditions anderson et al 2013 kumar et al 2014 drought can develop into a natural disaster depending on its severity duration and frequency which leads to an increased need for drought monitoring and water resource management systems anderson et al 2011 2013 under the east asian monsoonal circulation the korean peninsula has been experiencing a 4 6 year cycle of extreme droughts at a nationwide scale since 1960 kwon et al 2016 south korea recently faced a severe drought during 2014 2015 when the annual rainfall was less than half of the historical average for two consecutive years which was regarded as the worst drought in the past 50 years kwon et al 2016 hong et al 2016 that drought resulted in the lowest recorded water level of most multi purpose dams and downstream reservoirs nearly depleted as a result of the decreased inflow in the han river and geum river basins over northern and western south korea kwon et al 2016 hong et al 2016 the 2014 2015 drought also ruined 60 km2 of agricultural area including 25 km2 of rice paddies equivalent to 0 3 of total rice paddy area hong et al 2016 currently the need for a national level drought monitoring system has received considerable attention and efforts are being made to improve the early detection of drought and the efficiency of mitigation responses jang 2018 the decision making for drought mitigation in south korea has been mainly supported by a dense network of rainfall data in meteorological stations and water storage in agricultural reservoirs the current actions and measures in the drought system have been carried out based on a meteorological drought index considering precipitation deficit water supply and demand however there has been no attempt to produce spatially distributed hydrological drought indices with the state of the art land surface models reporting an agricultural drought i e deficit in soil moisture states over south korea soil moisture plays an important role in our understanding of the interaction between the atmosphere and earth s surface and reflects agricultural and hydrological drought conditions sheffield and wood 2007 spennemann et al 2015 li et al 2018 compared to precipitation soil moisture is more spatially heterogeneous and an excellent proxy indicator to represent local drought conditions controlled by topography and land cover chaney et al 2015 recently in situ measurements and remote sensing products have provided soil moisture estimation which can serve as important short term drought monthly to seasonal indicators spennemann et al 2015 but long term 30 years records of soil moisture measurements in their spatial and temporal coverages are not available in many parts of the world to represent the average conditions and figure out the extremes anderson et al 2011 spennemann et al 2015 remote sensing instruments have been important to provide spatiotemporally continuous soil moisture for agricultural drought monitoring since the 1970 s jackson et al 2010 pietroniro and prowse 2002 but their coarse spatial scales and limited operation period of these satellite sensors have prevented their widespread application in drought monitoring for studying long term trend and variability of soil moisture the european space agency climate change initiative esa cci combined multiple passive and active microwave soil moisture satellite products along with a consistent climatology loew et al 2013 dorigo et al 2015 several studies have demonstrated that the use of land surface models lsms driven by observed meteorological forcing datasets produce spatially and temporally continuous estimation of agricultural drought across scales at a global scale the global land data assimilation system gldas provides products related to soil moisture and drought conditions in near real time from multiple lsms and different meteorological forcing datasets at 1 resolution for version 1 and 0 25 resolutions for version 2 products rodell et al 2004 other studies focused on agricultural droughts in south america e g spennemann et al 2015 and china e g yuan et al 2015 from gldas the united states e g kumar et al 2014 from the north american land data assimilation system nldas mitchell et al 2004 and africa e g mcnally et al 2016 from the famine early warning systems network fews net land data assimilation system fldas mcnally et al 2017 however few studies have attempted to use lsms and investigate agricultural drought over south korea where high resolution soil moisture data are necessary to identify detailed spatial drought conditions due to complex topography and heterogenous soil moisture texture types park et al 2017 for instance though gldas version 2 products can represent most inland areas in south korea with an intermediate spatial resolution 25 km gldas version 1 products including simulations of multiple lsms and passive microwave products i e smmr ssm i and tmi with a coarse spatial resolution 60 100 km are limited to capture the complete coverage of south korea excluding most coastal regions of the korean peninsula model based soil moisture has not been fully served as an agricultural drought index in south korea where rice paddy agriculture is an important sector as a major source of livelihood similar to south and southeast asian countries most of the agricultural drought analysis in south korea have been carried out using remote sensing data and re analysis data without a modeling framework e g ryu et al 2019 yoon et al 2020 park et al 2017 sur et al 2015 therefore this study 1 establishes the korea land data assimilation system kldas with the added value of local precipitation forcing dataset and soil texture maps to produce soil moisture estimates and their drought estimates at a 1 km spatial resolution 2 evaluates soil moisture estimates and drought estimates from kldas against in situ measurements for 2013 2015 and the one month standardized precipitation index spi 1 for 1982 2016 3 compares kldas products with two benchmark ldas products gldas version 2 and fldas and one remote sensing product esa cci and 4 examines the performance of kldas agricultural drought area percentages in the four major river basins of south korea the focus here is to evaluate surface soil moisture estimates due to the data availability of the remote sensing product and in situ measurements though agriculture drought is more related to shortages of root zone soil moisture this study serves to support the use of kldas as an agricultural drought indicator to facilitate continuous regional high resolution soil moisture monitoring for the analysis of droughts over south korea the findings of this study serves as an important baseline and support for the upcoming kldas development driven by a broad range of improved local meteorological forcing datasets 2 data and methods 2 1 study area the study area covers the southern part of the korean peninsula between 33 8 n to 39 n and 124 5 e to 130 e climatologically this domain represents the asian monsoon region which has a wet summer season from june to august when nearly half of the annual precipitation of 1350 mm falls with summer typhoons and heavy rains jang 2018 sur et al 2015 the country frequently experiences droughts during crop growing seasons between april and october due to absolute shortage of rainfall park et al 2017 over 60 of the domain consists of mixed forest deciduous broadleaf forest and woody savanna whereas cropland covers 30 mainly over the western and southwestern regions sur et al 2015 the agriculture area of south korea is 16 000 km2 mafra 2017 agricultural reservoirs 17 000 groundwater pumping stations 7 000 irrigation canals 120 000 km2 serve to offer water to the cropland ryu et al 2019 mafra 2017 this study focuses on the four major river basins which current national drought management framework has been mainly oriented to han river basin 26 000 km2 over north geum river basin 10 000 km2 over west nakdong river basin 24 000 km2 over southeast and yeongsan river basin 8 000 km2 over southwest of south korea 100 000 km2 2 2 kldas kldas was established using the noah land surface model with multi parameterization version 3 6 noah mp cai et al 2014 at a 0 01 spatial resolution grid with a 15 min timestep to generate daily energy and water balance variables the kldas domain covers the korean peninsula including north and south korea between 33 n to 44 n and 124 e to 132 e noah mp was selected because of its ability to explicitly represent groundwater dynamic vegetation phenology and a multilayer snowpack in this study we used the modified international geosphere biosphere programme 20 category landuse data from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis friedl et al 2002 monthly climatologies of leaf area index lai and greenness fraction from the noaa advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr gutman and ignatov 1998 for model physical processes we used the simple groundwater model simgm runoff and groundwater option monthly lai with constant shade fraction for vegetation model and the ball berry for canopy stomatal resistance niu et al 2007 we ran the simulation from 1980 to 2016 and reinitialized it in 1980 for the lsm variables to reach equilibrium soil moisture estimates from the first soil layer 0 10 cm out of four soil layers were extracted for our analysis the choice of the soil depth was matched with the average soil layer depth of in situ measurements used in this study as well as gldas and fldas products the modern era retrospective analysis for research and applications version 2 merra 2 reichle et al 2017 datasets were used to force the model merra 2 is available globally at the hourly time step and horizontal resolution of 2 3 longitude by 1 2 latitude specifically precipitation observations from 101 automated synoptic observing system asos stationsof korean meteorological administration kma in south korea and 27 global telecommunication system gts stations in north korea were processed into 12 hourly and 0 01 gridded data using inverse distance weighting locations of the asos stations used in this study are shown in fig 1 a the combined asos and gts precipitation dataset replaced the merra 2 precipitation fields the elevation data from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm rodriguez et al 2005 was used to derive the topography datasets of elevation slope and aspect other meteorological inputs i e air temperature humidity pressure winds radiation from merra 2 were adjusted for the elevation differences through lapse rate and slope aspect correction methods kumar et al 2013 and downscaled to 0 01 gridded data instead of employing global soil texture datasets 16 category soil texture maps at a 30 meter spatial resolution grid over south korea combined with 8 category soil texture maps at a scale of 1 500 000 for the border between north and south korea from the korea water resources corporation k water more details can be found in jung et al 2017 were rescaled into 0 01 gridded data as inputs to the kldas over 70 of the soil type consists of sand and loam which are more dominant than clay and silt in the study area 2 3 comparison datasets 2 3 1 gldas the soil moisture products from gldas version 2 0 1948 2010 and version 2 1 2000 present datasets from the noah version 3 3 model on a 0 25 gridded data were used in this study rodell et al 2004 in contrast to the same lsm used in the two versions gldas 2 0 was entirely forced with the princeton meteorological forcing data on a 1 gridded data sheffield et al 2006 whereas gldas 2 1 was forced with a combination of national center for environmental prediction s global data assimilation system gdas atmospheric analysis fields on a 0 2 gridded data derber et al 1991 and global precipitation climatology project gpcp precipitation field on a 1 gridded data adler et al 2003 gldas version 2 1 starts in january 2000 so the bias corrected gldas version 2 0 for years 1982 1999 are merged into gldas version 2 1 to match the long term kldas outputs for 1982 2016 we used the mean and standard deviation of the two version datasets during the overlapped years 2000 2010 to correct the bias between the two products the soil texture maps were derived from 5 min resolution global soil datasets with 16 category soil texture of food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao more details can be found in reynolds et al 2000 rodell et al 2004 the global soil texture map shows a constant class of loam in the study area 2 3 2 fldas fldas recently released global monthly products in 0 10 resolution from the noah version 3 6 1 model ranging from january 1982 to present mcnally et al 2017 the soil moisture estimates in the first layer 0 10 cm from the fldas products were used for this study the simulation was forced by a combination of the merra 2 data and climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station chirps funk et al 2015 6 hourly rainfall data note that compared to spatial resolution differences amongst the three ldas products the fao s global soil texture maps used in gldas and the merra 2 meteorological forcing dataset used in kldas were rescaling into 0 10 gridded data to inputs to the fldas 2 3 3 esa cci the esa cci surface soil moisture dataset version 4 2 from november 1978 to december 2016 was used in this study dorigo et al 2015 the global product combined satellite soil moisture retrievals from four passive i e the nimbus 7 scanning multi channel microwave radiometer smmr the special sensor microwave imagers ssm i of the defense meteorological satellite program the tropical rainfall measuring mission microwave imager tmi and the advanced microwave scanning radiometer earth observing system amsr e sensor on nasa s aqua satellite and two active the european remote sensing satellites 1 and 2 active microwave instrument ami wind scatterometer and the advanced scatterometer ascat onboard the meteorological operational platform the active products were merged into a combined dataset since august 1991 this long term product enables climate studies and drought analysis which is available daily on a 0 25 spatial resolution on a global coverage 2 4 evaluation procedure we evaluate kldas soil moisture estimates for the use of drought monitoring during the crop growing seasons from april to october also we employ gldas fldas and esa cci as benchmark datasets and intercompare them with kldas these benchmark products were downscaled into 0 01 using nearest liner interpolation for our evaluation and comparison first precipitation datasets gpcp used to force gldas and chirps used to force fldas were evaluated against the asos gridded dataset used in kldas for years 1982 2016 since precipitation is the most important input data into the lsms to estimate soil moisture we calculated their spatial distribution maps of annual rates the average monthly rates and the cumulative distribution functions cdf for monthly precipitation during crop growing seasons second soil moisture estimates were evaluated against 78 in situ observations for short term 3 years 2013 2015 there are 17 stations used for evaluation in the han river basin 19 in the geum river basin 13 in the nakdong river basin and 9 in the yeongsan river basin daily soil moisture observations were obtained from the korea meteorological administration kma and rural development administration rda and were aggregated into monthly values for the evaluation more details can be found in jung et al 2017 at the stations soil moisture was measured using time domain reflectometry tdr at an average depth of 10 cm though the sensing depth of satellite data e g esa cci is only a few centimeters surface soil moisture is closely related to soil moisture in the upper 10 cm albergel et al 2008 which is the depth of the first soil layer for our selected lsms in this study considering that there are large biases between the model and satellite soil moisture datasets koster et al 2009 we computed anomalies for all soil moisture values the pearson correlation coefficient r and the root mean squared error rmse of the soil moisture anomalies were calculated to investigate the similarity between the soil moisture products and ground observations third for evaluation of long term soil moisture estimates soil moisture datasets were converted into standardized soil moisture index ssmi and were evaluated against the 1 month standardized precipitation index spi 1 mckee et al 1993 using 35 years of historical data measured at 101 asos stations for 1982 2016 in this study the spi 1 was used because of limited soil moisture measurements for a long period of records the spi on a time scale of 1 3 months gives the highest correlation with surface soil moisture whereas deeper soil layers show better correlation with longer time scales sims et al 2002 previous studies sur et al 2015 choi et al 2013 demonstrated that the short term spi shows similar spatial and temporal patterns as ssmi and can be used as a drought index in south korea also the short term spi has been used to quantify agricultural droughts in other regions such as south america spennemann et al 2015 and china li et al 2018 yuan et al 2015 finally probability of detection pod false alarm rate far and equitable threat score ets were calculated to evaluate drought estimates from four soil moisture products against spi 1 drought area from the gridded asos dataset wilks et al 2011 surface soil moisture is so responsive to precipitation that the precipitation based index can be used as independent dourght evaluation the drought condition is defined as the monthly ssmi and spi 1 less than 0 8 yuan et al 2015 this has the highest applicability in south korea and corresponds to moderate drought percentile 20 classified in the u s drought monitor usdm svoboda et al 2002 also we calculate the yearly drought area percentages for years 1982 2016 and compare the four soil moisture products at a basin scale 3 results and discussion 3 1 evaluation of precipitation datasets the gpcp and chirps datasets are evaluated against the observation based precipitation asos dataset obs in fig 1 in terms of the average annual precipitation rates for years 1982 2016 gpcp 1193 mm yr is lower than obs 1268 mm yr but shows the similar spatial pattern as the obs chirps shows the highest annual precipitation rates 1316 mm yr and represents higher rates particularly over southern and mid eastern regions both domain averaged temporal correlation coefficients of obsvgpcp and obsvchirps are 0 95 but their spatial distributions are different see fig 1 d 1e the correlation coefficient map between asos and gpcp presents pointwise local patterns with lower values in areas near to asos precipitation stations i e the bulls eye features due to its coarser resolution compared to chirps in terms of the average monthly precipitation rates there are larger differences during wet seasons from july to august with almost half of the annual precipitation rates the cumulative distribution functions cdf of three precipitation products in fig 1 g 1 h 1i are similar during spring april to june but shows the discrepancies during late summer july to august and early autumn september to october as a result gldas forced by gpcp is likely to underestimate soil moisture whereas fldas forced by chirps may overestimate soil moisture over the study area this suggests that bias correction of the global precipitation datasets could improve their forced lsms or hydrological models particularly during wet season in south korea 3 2 evaluation of soil moisture estimates soil moisture estimates from kldas gldas fldas and esa cci are evaluated against 78 in situ observations between april and october during 2013 2015 in fig 2 overall kldas shows the best performance for all river basins in terms of anomaly r and anomaly rmse metrics the order of the evaluation metrics from highest to lowest is kldas esa cci gldas and fldas this supports that kldas at 0 01 spatial resolution better represents in situ soil moisture measurements than gldas at 0 25 resolution fldas at 0 1 resolution and esa cci at 0 25 resolution with the added value of local precipitation forcing dataset and soil texture maps they provide more accurate and higher resolution datasets compared to the corresponding inputs to the other ldas products for example soil texture maps from k water accommodate more detailed categories of sandy loam 73 clay loam 14 and silty clay loam 5 whereas the fao s global soil texture maps occupy dominantly loam 96 three additional noah mp experiments at 0 01 spatial resolution were carried out to separate out the effect of precipitation soil texture and downscaled meteorological forcing datasets on the kldas soil moisture estimates table 1 shows that an experiment without local precipitation and soil texture map i e ex3 outperforms the other ldas soil moisture estimates by downscaling merra 2 meteorological forcing datasets through lapse rate and slope aspect correction methods and running the lsm at higher spatial resolution also the local precipitation effect is larger than the local soil texture map when comparing the evaluation metric r and ubrmse values of these experiments the kldas forced by both local precipitation and soil texture map shows the highest domain averaged r value whereas the lowest domain averaged ubrmse value occurs in an experiment using only local precipitation dataset at a basin scale the nakdong river basin shows the highest r and lowest rmse values than the other river basins except for rmse in esa cci this is related to the fact that compared to the nakdong river basin the han river basin is located over mixed forests and built up areas and shows more spatial heterogeneity in soil moisture estimates the geum and yeongsan river basins are mostly composed of cropland i e rice paddy agriculture where irrigated areas may not be well modeled for their regional irrigation rates the kldas gldas and fldas products used in this study do not consider irrigation modules in the modeling framework to generate their hydrological variables 3 3 evaluation of standardized soil moisture index monthly ssmi maps from the four soil moisture products are evaluated against monthly spi 1 from the asos precipitation dataset for 1982 2016 in south korea where long term records of in situ soil moisture measurements are limited fig 3 represents the spatial distribution maps of the ssmi and spi 1 values for a recent may 2015 drought event in south korea overall ssmi maps show dry status with negative values in northern south korea and relatively wet status in southern south korea the spi 1 maps from the asos observations gpcp and chirps were expected to show the similar spatial pattern of the ssmi maps from kldas gldas and fldas respectively this supports that despite the similar lsms used in the three ldas products and the same merra 2 forcing dataset used in the two ldas products changes in precipitation can serve as the main driver of the modeled soil moisture variability it is noteworthy that most products show the may 2015 drought condition in the central region but the gldas and esa cci products present mild conditions compared to gldas and esa cci fldas seems to better capture the may 2015 drought with the similar spatial pattern as the kldas map fig 4 shows the correlation coefficients between the asos spi 1 and each of the four monthly ssmis for 1982 2016 the order of the evaluation metric from highest to lowest is kldas gldas fldas and esa cci kldas shows the best result which is in agreement with evaluation of soil moisture estimates in fig 2 but the lowest performance is found in esa cci with the second best in fig 2 this indicates that though esa cci better captures recent soil moisture behavior it is not feasible to detect historical drought conditions this can be related to the fact that the quality of esa cci product depends on the quality of the data used in its algorithm the esa cci products with more recent satellite observations can provide improved soil moisture estimates along with an increase of the spatio temporal coverages note that only a single passive microwave retrieval was used to produce soil moisture estimates in the early period 1979 1991 of the esa cci merged product dorigo et al 2015 mcnally et al 2016 interestingly kldas presents more detailed spatial patterns due to higher resolution soil texture maps as the model inputs the border between north and south korea at latitudes 38 39 appears with a coarser spatial scale as a result of the coarser soil texture maps and lower precipitation sampling rates compared to the domain of south korea gldas and eas cci show the lowest performance in the midwestern region particularly with the bulls eye pattern in gldas this localized lower performance is found in the seoul metropolitan area a location with heterogeneous land cover this can be also explained by the fact that these two coarser global products are limited to capture local scale spatiotemporal variability of hydrological variables at a basin scale the yeongsan river basin shows the highest r values in kldas and esa cci but the lowest values in gldas product which is similar to the results in fig 2 the correlation coefficients between the asos spi 1 and each of the four monthly ssmis are calculated by months from april to october in fig 5 overall all soil moisture products show similar r values in both dry and wet seasons kldas shows higher r values 0 6 during all crop growing seasons with lower standard deviations than the other soil moisture products this supports that their agricultural drought estimates have little seasonal variation and bias which can be useful to monitor droughts during all crop growing seasons between april and october 3 4 evaluation of drought estimates the spatial maps of probability of detection pod false alarm rate far and equitable threat score ets for monthly agricultural drought estimates are calculated in fig 6 monthly agricultural droughts ssmi less than 0 8 detect 50 of monthly precipitation droughts spi 1 less than 0 8 over south korea with an average pod of 0 45 0 67 and ets of 0 19 0 43 in the four major river basins except for esa cci the order of evaluation metrics pod and ets from highest to lowest is kldas gldas fldas and esa cci which follows the same order of the ssmi evaluation in fig 4 it is noteworthy that gldas outperforms eas cci products with the same spatial resolution and shows the similar performance as fldas at a higher spatial resolution in evaluation of drought estimates compared to far both pod and ets show more similar spatial patterns at a basin scale the order of basins from highest to lowest in evaluation of drought estimates are different from the results in figs 2 and 4 this can be explained by the fact that the evaluations of soil moistures estimates and their ssmi indices include the whole range of values but this evaluation of drought estimates consider only a range of the lowest values time series of the drought area percentages are calculated for each of the four river basins for 1982 2016 in fig 7 the drought area percentages from the four soil moisture products are evaluated against the asos spi 1 in terms of r and rmse values as expected kldas shows the best performance in all river basins the order of evaluation metrics r and rmse from highest to lowest is the similar order as both evaluations in figs 4 and 6 but fldas slightly outperforms gldas except in the geum river basin overall kldas and fldas provide higher r 0 63 and lower rmse 17 values in all four river basins it is interesting to note that overestimation of the agricultural drought areas is found in the nakdong river and yeongsan river basins during 1982 200 in the gldas products which leads to produce lower performance than the other han river and geum river basins all four major river basins also appear to experience periodic droughts related to the impact of regional monsoon circulation over the east asia ssmi from kldas shows that these basins have wet status with lower drought area percentages 20 for years 1983 1987 1990 1991 1993 1998 1999 2002 2007 2010 2011 2013 and dry status with higher drought area percentages 40 for years 1982 1988 1994 2001 2015 in fig 7 the most recent 2015 drought event leads to the highest drought area percentage 74 of the han river basin and 69 of the geum river basin in the past 35 years for our study period 4 conclusions regional land surface models are required to facilitate continuous hydrological monitoring for the analysis of droughts and their characteristics of spatial variation intensity and frequency under climate change but model based soil moisture has not been fully served as an agricultural drought index to monitor long term drought conditions in south korea in this study we describe the development of a 0 01 resolution ldas using the noah mp model with the added value of local precipitation forcing dataset and high resolution soil texture maps in south korea where rugged topography and heterogeneous land covers make coarse resolution lsm and satellite retrieval difficult to capture agricultural droughts this study examines the potential of kldas soil moisture estimates for long term drought monitoring during crop growing seasons for 1982 2016 the kldas soil moisture estimates are evaluated using two reference datasets 3 year in situ soil moisture measurements and 35 year observed precipitation based spi 1 also we employ gldas fldas and esa cci as benchmark datasets and intercompare them with kldas because these soil moisture products have been investigated for good quality drought monitoring in other regions these datasets are the only available resource to provide long term soil moisture estimates over south korea kldas outperforms the benchmark soil moisture estimates and their drought estimates in south korea for drought detectability kldas has higher pod and ets than the other ldas and satellite retrieval products in all four major river basins the gpcp used to force gldas and chirps used to force fldas datasets are under and overestimated than the observation based asos dataset in south korea for 1982 2016 particularly during wet seasons the gldas and esa cci products show the lowest performance in the metropolitan area with heterogeneous land covers this work suggests that improved precipitation soil texture maps and model spatial resolution are crucial for agricultural drought estimation over south korea esa cci shows the second best in the recent soil moisture estimates against in situ measurements for a shorter period of time 2013 2015 but our results indicate that the esa cci products are not feasible for long term drought monitoring over south korea due to lower data quality for early periods 1979 1991 of the esa cci merged product from a basin scale perspective the nakdong river basin in the southeast of south korea shows the best results in the soil moisture estimation for 2013 2015 because the mid eastern region is high in elevation with rugged topography and the western and southern regions are more occupied with cropland where irrigation modules need to be considered but were not included by any of these ldas products improved forcing datasets and additional model development can meet the full potential of the kldas as agricultural drought monitoring tools currently the other asos meteorological forcing datasets i e wind air temperature pressure humidity than the precipitation are being processed into a 0 01 gridded data and are set to force high resolution kldas coupled with a river routing scheme getirana et al 2012 2017 assimilating land surface data into lsms can improve poorly represented processes over irrigated and vegetation covered areas kumar et al 2015 jung et al 2019 which cannot be supported by simpler models and ground observation based spi and ssmi approaches in addition to the enhanced drought monitoring system kldas is expected to provide important information on water resources as a valuable tool for key stakeholders to manage natural resources and develop water supply guidelines and best practices in south korea credit authorship contribution statement hahn chul jung writing original draft conceptualization methodology

5239,the korea land data assimilation system kldas has been established for agricultural drought i e soil moisture deficit monitoring in south korea running the noah mp land surface model within the nasa land information system lis framework with the added value of local precipitation forcing dataset and soil texture maps kldas soil moisture is benchmarked against three global products the global land data assimilation system gldas the famine early warning systems network fews net land data assimilation system fldas and the european space agency climate change initiative esa cci satellite product the evaluation is performed using in situ measurements for 2013 2015 and one month standardized precipitation index spi 1 for 1982 2016 focusing on four major river basins in south korea the kldas outperforms all benchmark products in capturing soil moisture states and variability at a basin scale compared to gldas and fldas products the eas cci product is not feasible for long term agricultural monitoring due to lower data quality for early periods 1979 1991 of soil moisture estimates kldas shows that the most recent 2015 drought event leads to highest drought areas in the han and geum river basins in the past 35 years this work supports kldas as an effective agricultural drought monitoring system to provide continuous regional high resolution soil moisture estimates in south korea keywords agricultural drought soil moisture precipitation land surface model 1 introduction drought is commonly characterized by the deficits of hydrologic budget variables i e precipitation soil moisture groundwater evapotranspiration and streamflow from average conditions anderson et al 2013 kumar et al 2014 drought can develop into a natural disaster depending on its severity duration and frequency which leads to an increased need for drought monitoring and water resource management systems anderson et al 2011 2013 under the east asian monsoonal circulation the korean peninsula has been experiencing a 4 6 year cycle of extreme droughts at a nationwide scale since 1960 kwon et al 2016 south korea recently faced a severe drought during 2014 2015 when the annual rainfall was less than half of the historical average for two consecutive years which was regarded as the worst drought in the past 50 years kwon et al 2016 hong et al 2016 that drought resulted in the lowest recorded water level of most multi purpose dams and downstream reservoirs nearly depleted as a result of the decreased inflow in the han river and geum river basins over northern and western south korea kwon et al 2016 hong et al 2016 the 2014 2015 drought also ruined 60 km2 of agricultural area including 25 km2 of rice paddies equivalent to 0 3 of total rice paddy area hong et al 2016 currently the need for a national level drought monitoring system has received considerable attention and efforts are being made to improve the early detection of drought and the efficiency of mitigation responses jang 2018 the decision making for drought mitigation in south korea has been mainly supported by a dense network of rainfall data in meteorological stations and water storage in agricultural reservoirs the current actions and measures in the drought system have been carried out based on a meteorological drought index considering precipitation deficit water supply and demand however there has been no attempt to produce spatially distributed hydrological drought indices with the state of the art land surface models reporting an agricultural drought i e deficit in soil moisture states over south korea soil moisture plays an important role in our understanding of the interaction between the atmosphere and earth s surface and reflects agricultural and hydrological drought conditions sheffield and wood 2007 spennemann et al 2015 li et al 2018 compared to precipitation soil moisture is more spatially heterogeneous and an excellent proxy indicator to represent local drought conditions controlled by topography and land cover chaney et al 2015 recently in situ measurements and remote sensing products have provided soil moisture estimation which can serve as important short term drought monthly to seasonal indicators spennemann et al 2015 but long term 30 years records of soil moisture measurements in their spatial and temporal coverages are not available in many parts of the world to represent the average conditions and figure out the extremes anderson et al 2011 spennemann et al 2015 remote sensing instruments have been important to provide spatiotemporally continuous soil moisture for agricultural drought monitoring since the 1970 s jackson et al 2010 pietroniro and prowse 2002 but their coarse spatial scales and limited operation period of these satellite sensors have prevented their widespread application in drought monitoring for studying long term trend and variability of soil moisture the european space agency climate change initiative esa cci combined multiple passive and active microwave soil moisture satellite products along with a consistent climatology loew et al 2013 dorigo et al 2015 several studies have demonstrated that the use of land surface models lsms driven by observed meteorological forcing datasets produce spatially and temporally continuous estimation of agricultural drought across scales at a global scale the global land data assimilation system gldas provides products related to soil moisture and drought conditions in near real time from multiple lsms and different meteorological forcing datasets at 1 resolution for version 1 and 0 25 resolutions for version 2 products rodell et al 2004 other studies focused on agricultural droughts in south america e g spennemann et al 2015 and china e g yuan et al 2015 from gldas the united states e g kumar et al 2014 from the north american land data assimilation system nldas mitchell et al 2004 and africa e g mcnally et al 2016 from the famine early warning systems network fews net land data assimilation system fldas mcnally et al 2017 however few studies have attempted to use lsms and investigate agricultural drought over south korea where high resolution soil moisture data are necessary to identify detailed spatial drought conditions due to complex topography and heterogenous soil moisture texture types park et al 2017 for instance though gldas version 2 products can represent most inland areas in south korea with an intermediate spatial resolution 25 km gldas version 1 products including simulations of multiple lsms and passive microwave products i e smmr ssm i and tmi with a coarse spatial resolution 60 100 km are limited to capture the complete coverage of south korea excluding most coastal regions of the korean peninsula model based soil moisture has not been fully served as an agricultural drought index in south korea where rice paddy agriculture is an important sector as a major source of livelihood similar to south and southeast asian countries most of the agricultural drought analysis in south korea have been carried out using remote sensing data and re analysis data without a modeling framework e g ryu et al 2019 yoon et al 2020 park et al 2017 sur et al 2015 therefore this study 1 establishes the korea land data assimilation system kldas with the added value of local precipitation forcing dataset and soil texture maps to produce soil moisture estimates and their drought estimates at a 1 km spatial resolution 2 evaluates soil moisture estimates and drought estimates from kldas against in situ measurements for 2013 2015 and the one month standardized precipitation index spi 1 for 1982 2016 3 compares kldas products with two benchmark ldas products gldas version 2 and fldas and one remote sensing product esa cci and 4 examines the performance of kldas agricultural drought area percentages in the four major river basins of south korea the focus here is to evaluate surface soil moisture estimates due to the data availability of the remote sensing product and in situ measurements though agriculture drought is more related to shortages of root zone soil moisture this study serves to support the use of kldas as an agricultural drought indicator to facilitate continuous regional high resolution soil moisture monitoring for the analysis of droughts over south korea the findings of this study serves as an important baseline and support for the upcoming kldas development driven by a broad range of improved local meteorological forcing datasets 2 data and methods 2 1 study area the study area covers the southern part of the korean peninsula between 33 8 n to 39 n and 124 5 e to 130 e climatologically this domain represents the asian monsoon region which has a wet summer season from june to august when nearly half of the annual precipitation of 1350 mm falls with summer typhoons and heavy rains jang 2018 sur et al 2015 the country frequently experiences droughts during crop growing seasons between april and october due to absolute shortage of rainfall park et al 2017 over 60 of the domain consists of mixed forest deciduous broadleaf forest and woody savanna whereas cropland covers 30 mainly over the western and southwestern regions sur et al 2015 the agriculture area of south korea is 16 000 km2 mafra 2017 agricultural reservoirs 17 000 groundwater pumping stations 7 000 irrigation canals 120 000 km2 serve to offer water to the cropland ryu et al 2019 mafra 2017 this study focuses on the four major river basins which current national drought management framework has been mainly oriented to han river basin 26 000 km2 over north geum river basin 10 000 km2 over west nakdong river basin 24 000 km2 over southeast and yeongsan river basin 8 000 km2 over southwest of south korea 100 000 km2 2 2 kldas kldas was established using the noah land surface model with multi parameterization version 3 6 noah mp cai et al 2014 at a 0 01 spatial resolution grid with a 15 min timestep to generate daily energy and water balance variables the kldas domain covers the korean peninsula including north and south korea between 33 n to 44 n and 124 e to 132 e noah mp was selected because of its ability to explicitly represent groundwater dynamic vegetation phenology and a multilayer snowpack in this study we used the modified international geosphere biosphere programme 20 category landuse data from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis friedl et al 2002 monthly climatologies of leaf area index lai and greenness fraction from the noaa advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr gutman and ignatov 1998 for model physical processes we used the simple groundwater model simgm runoff and groundwater option monthly lai with constant shade fraction for vegetation model and the ball berry for canopy stomatal resistance niu et al 2007 we ran the simulation from 1980 to 2016 and reinitialized it in 1980 for the lsm variables to reach equilibrium soil moisture estimates from the first soil layer 0 10 cm out of four soil layers were extracted for our analysis the choice of the soil depth was matched with the average soil layer depth of in situ measurements used in this study as well as gldas and fldas products the modern era retrospective analysis for research and applications version 2 merra 2 reichle et al 2017 datasets were used to force the model merra 2 is available globally at the hourly time step and horizontal resolution of 2 3 longitude by 1 2 latitude specifically precipitation observations from 101 automated synoptic observing system asos stationsof korean meteorological administration kma in south korea and 27 global telecommunication system gts stations in north korea were processed into 12 hourly and 0 01 gridded data using inverse distance weighting locations of the asos stations used in this study are shown in fig 1 a the combined asos and gts precipitation dataset replaced the merra 2 precipitation fields the elevation data from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm rodriguez et al 2005 was used to derive the topography datasets of elevation slope and aspect other meteorological inputs i e air temperature humidity pressure winds radiation from merra 2 were adjusted for the elevation differences through lapse rate and slope aspect correction methods kumar et al 2013 and downscaled to 0 01 gridded data instead of employing global soil texture datasets 16 category soil texture maps at a 30 meter spatial resolution grid over south korea combined with 8 category soil texture maps at a scale of 1 500 000 for the border between north and south korea from the korea water resources corporation k water more details can be found in jung et al 2017 were rescaled into 0 01 gridded data as inputs to the kldas over 70 of the soil type consists of sand and loam which are more dominant than clay and silt in the study area 2 3 comparison datasets 2 3 1 gldas the soil moisture products from gldas version 2 0 1948 2010 and version 2 1 2000 present datasets from the noah version 3 3 model on a 0 25 gridded data were used in this study rodell et al 2004 in contrast to the same lsm used in the two versions gldas 2 0 was entirely forced with the princeton meteorological forcing data on a 1 gridded data sheffield et al 2006 whereas gldas 2 1 was forced with a combination of national center for environmental prediction s global data assimilation system gdas atmospheric analysis fields on a 0 2 gridded data derber et al 1991 and global precipitation climatology project gpcp precipitation field on a 1 gridded data adler et al 2003 gldas version 2 1 starts in january 2000 so the bias corrected gldas version 2 0 for years 1982 1999 are merged into gldas version 2 1 to match the long term kldas outputs for 1982 2016 we used the mean and standard deviation of the two version datasets during the overlapped years 2000 2010 to correct the bias between the two products the soil texture maps were derived from 5 min resolution global soil datasets with 16 category soil texture of food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao more details can be found in reynolds et al 2000 rodell et al 2004 the global soil texture map shows a constant class of loam in the study area 2 3 2 fldas fldas recently released global monthly products in 0 10 resolution from the noah version 3 6 1 model ranging from january 1982 to present mcnally et al 2017 the soil moisture estimates in the first layer 0 10 cm from the fldas products were used for this study the simulation was forced by a combination of the merra 2 data and climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station chirps funk et al 2015 6 hourly rainfall data note that compared to spatial resolution differences amongst the three ldas products the fao s global soil texture maps used in gldas and the merra 2 meteorological forcing dataset used in kldas were rescaling into 0 10 gridded data to inputs to the fldas 2 3 3 esa cci the esa cci surface soil moisture dataset version 4 2 from november 1978 to december 2016 was used in this study dorigo et al 2015 the global product combined satellite soil moisture retrievals from four passive i e the nimbus 7 scanning multi channel microwave radiometer smmr the special sensor microwave imagers ssm i of the defense meteorological satellite program the tropical rainfall measuring mission microwave imager tmi and the advanced microwave scanning radiometer earth observing system amsr e sensor on nasa s aqua satellite and two active the european remote sensing satellites 1 and 2 active microwave instrument ami wind scatterometer and the advanced scatterometer ascat onboard the meteorological operational platform the active products were merged into a combined dataset since august 1991 this long term product enables climate studies and drought analysis which is available daily on a 0 25 spatial resolution on a global coverage 2 4 evaluation procedure we evaluate kldas soil moisture estimates for the use of drought monitoring during the crop growing seasons from april to october also we employ gldas fldas and esa cci as benchmark datasets and intercompare them with kldas these benchmark products were downscaled into 0 01 using nearest liner interpolation for our evaluation and comparison first precipitation datasets gpcp used to force gldas and chirps used to force fldas were evaluated against the asos gridded dataset used in kldas for years 1982 2016 since precipitation is the most important input data into the lsms to estimate soil moisture we calculated their spatial distribution maps of annual rates the average monthly rates and the cumulative distribution functions cdf for monthly precipitation during crop growing seasons second soil moisture estimates were evaluated against 78 in situ observations for short term 3 years 2013 2015 there are 17 stations used for evaluation in the han river basin 19 in the geum river basin 13 in the nakdong river basin and 9 in the yeongsan river basin daily soil moisture observations were obtained from the korea meteorological administration kma and rural development administration rda and were aggregated into monthly values for the evaluation more details can be found in jung et al 2017 at the stations soil moisture was measured using time domain reflectometry tdr at an average depth of 10 cm though the sensing depth of satellite data e g esa cci is only a few centimeters surface soil moisture is closely related to soil moisture in the upper 10 cm albergel et al 2008 which is the depth of the first soil layer for our selected lsms in this study considering that there are large biases between the model and satellite soil moisture datasets koster et al 2009 we computed anomalies for all soil moisture values the pearson correlation coefficient r and the root mean squared error rmse of the soil moisture anomalies were calculated to investigate the similarity between the soil moisture products and ground observations third for evaluation of long term soil moisture estimates soil moisture datasets were converted into standardized soil moisture index ssmi and were evaluated against the 1 month standardized precipitation index spi 1 mckee et al 1993 using 35 years of historical data measured at 101 asos stations for 1982 2016 in this study the spi 1 was used because of limited soil moisture measurements for a long period of records the spi on a time scale of 1 3 months gives the highest correlation with surface soil moisture whereas deeper soil layers show better correlation with longer time scales sims et al 2002 previous studies sur et al 2015 choi et al 2013 demonstrated that the short term spi shows similar spatial and temporal patterns as ssmi and can be used as a drought index in south korea also the short term spi has been used to quantify agricultural droughts in other regions such as south america spennemann et al 2015 and china li et al 2018 yuan et al 2015 finally probability of detection pod false alarm rate far and equitable threat score ets were calculated to evaluate drought estimates from four soil moisture products against spi 1 drought area from the gridded asos dataset wilks et al 2011 surface soil moisture is so responsive to precipitation that the precipitation based index can be used as independent dourght evaluation the drought condition is defined as the monthly ssmi and spi 1 less than 0 8 yuan et al 2015 this has the highest applicability in south korea and corresponds to moderate drought percentile 20 classified in the u s drought monitor usdm svoboda et al 2002 also we calculate the yearly drought area percentages for years 1982 2016 and compare the four soil moisture products at a basin scale 3 results and discussion 3 1 evaluation of precipitation datasets the gpcp and chirps datasets are evaluated against the observation based precipitation asos dataset obs in fig 1 in terms of the average annual precipitation rates for years 1982 2016 gpcp 1193 mm yr is lower than obs 1268 mm yr but shows the similar spatial pattern as the obs chirps shows the highest annual precipitation rates 1316 mm yr and represents higher rates particularly over southern and mid eastern regions both domain averaged temporal correlation coefficients of obsvgpcp and obsvchirps are 0 95 but their spatial distributions are different see fig 1 d 1e the correlation coefficient map between asos and gpcp presents pointwise local patterns with lower values in areas near to asos precipitation stations i e the bulls eye features due to its coarser resolution compared to chirps in terms of the average monthly precipitation rates there are larger differences during wet seasons from july to august with almost half of the annual precipitation rates the cumulative distribution functions cdf of three precipitation products in fig 1 g 1 h 1i are similar during spring april to june but shows the discrepancies during late summer july to august and early autumn september to october as a result gldas forced by gpcp is likely to underestimate soil moisture whereas fldas forced by chirps may overestimate soil moisture over the study area this suggests that bias correction of the global precipitation datasets could improve their forced lsms or hydrological models particularly during wet season in south korea 3 2 evaluation of soil moisture estimates soil moisture estimates from kldas gldas fldas and esa cci are evaluated against 78 in situ observations between april and october during 2013 2015 in fig 2 overall kldas shows the best performance for all river basins in terms of anomaly r and anomaly rmse metrics the order of the evaluation metrics from highest to lowest is kldas esa cci gldas and fldas this supports that kldas at 0 01 spatial resolution better represents in situ soil moisture measurements than gldas at 0 25 resolution fldas at 0 1 resolution and esa cci at 0 25 resolution with the added value of local precipitation forcing dataset and soil texture maps they provide more accurate and higher resolution datasets compared to the corresponding inputs to the other ldas products for example soil texture maps from k water accommodate more detailed categories of sandy loam 73 clay loam 14 and silty clay loam 5 whereas the fao s global soil texture maps occupy dominantly loam 96 three additional noah mp experiments at 0 01 spatial resolution were carried out to separate out the effect of precipitation soil texture and downscaled meteorological forcing datasets on the kldas soil moisture estimates table 1 shows that an experiment without local precipitation and soil texture map i e ex3 outperforms the other ldas soil moisture estimates by downscaling merra 2 meteorological forcing datasets through lapse rate and slope aspect correction methods and running the lsm at higher spatial resolution also the local precipitation effect is larger than the local soil texture map when comparing the evaluation metric r and ubrmse values of these experiments the kldas forced by both local precipitation and soil texture map shows the highest domain averaged r value whereas the lowest domain averaged ubrmse value occurs in an experiment using only local precipitation dataset at a basin scale the nakdong river basin shows the highest r and lowest rmse values than the other river basins except for rmse in esa cci this is related to the fact that compared to the nakdong river basin the han river basin is located over mixed forests and built up areas and shows more spatial heterogeneity in soil moisture estimates the geum and yeongsan river basins are mostly composed of cropland i e rice paddy agriculture where irrigated areas may not be well modeled for their regional irrigation rates the kldas gldas and fldas products used in this study do not consider irrigation modules in the modeling framework to generate their hydrological variables 3 3 evaluation of standardized soil moisture index monthly ssmi maps from the four soil moisture products are evaluated against monthly spi 1 from the asos precipitation dataset for 1982 2016 in south korea where long term records of in situ soil moisture measurements are limited fig 3 represents the spatial distribution maps of the ssmi and spi 1 values for a recent may 2015 drought event in south korea overall ssmi maps show dry status with negative values in northern south korea and relatively wet status in southern south korea the spi 1 maps from the asos observations gpcp and chirps were expected to show the similar spatial pattern of the ssmi maps from kldas gldas and fldas respectively this supports that despite the similar lsms used in the three ldas products and the same merra 2 forcing dataset used in the two ldas products changes in precipitation can serve as the main driver of the modeled soil moisture variability it is noteworthy that most products show the may 2015 drought condition in the central region but the gldas and esa cci products present mild conditions compared to gldas and esa cci fldas seems to better capture the may 2015 drought with the similar spatial pattern as the kldas map fig 4 shows the correlation coefficients between the asos spi 1 and each of the four monthly ssmis for 1982 2016 the order of the evaluation metric from highest to lowest is kldas gldas fldas and esa cci kldas shows the best result which is in agreement with evaluation of soil moisture estimates in fig 2 but the lowest performance is found in esa cci with the second best in fig 2 this indicates that though esa cci better captures recent soil moisture behavior it is not feasible to detect historical drought conditions this can be related to the fact that the quality of esa cci product depends on the quality of the data used in its algorithm the esa cci products with more recent satellite observations can provide improved soil moisture estimates along with an increase of the spatio temporal coverages note that only a single passive microwave retrieval was used to produce soil moisture estimates in the early period 1979 1991 of the esa cci merged product dorigo et al 2015 mcnally et al 2016 interestingly kldas presents more detailed spatial patterns due to higher resolution soil texture maps as the model inputs the border between north and south korea at latitudes 38 39 appears with a coarser spatial scale as a result of the coarser soil texture maps and lower precipitation sampling rates compared to the domain of south korea gldas and eas cci show the lowest performance in the midwestern region particularly with the bulls eye pattern in gldas this localized lower performance is found in the seoul metropolitan area a location with heterogeneous land cover this can be also explained by the fact that these two coarser global products are limited to capture local scale spatiotemporal variability of hydrological variables at a basin scale the yeongsan river basin shows the highest r values in kldas and esa cci but the lowest values in gldas product which is similar to the results in fig 2 the correlation coefficients between the asos spi 1 and each of the four monthly ssmis are calculated by months from april to october in fig 5 overall all soil moisture products show similar r values in both dry and wet seasons kldas shows higher r values 0 6 during all crop growing seasons with lower standard deviations than the other soil moisture products this supports that their agricultural drought estimates have little seasonal variation and bias which can be useful to monitor droughts during all crop growing seasons between april and october 3 4 evaluation of drought estimates the spatial maps of probability of detection pod false alarm rate far and equitable threat score ets for monthly agricultural drought estimates are calculated in fig 6 monthly agricultural droughts ssmi less than 0 8 detect 50 of monthly precipitation droughts spi 1 less than 0 8 over south korea with an average pod of 0 45 0 67 and ets of 0 19 0 43 in the four major river basins except for esa cci the order of evaluation metrics pod and ets from highest to lowest is kldas gldas fldas and esa cci which follows the same order of the ssmi evaluation in fig 4 it is noteworthy that gldas outperforms eas cci products with the same spatial resolution and shows the similar performance as fldas at a higher spatial resolution in evaluation of drought estimates compared to far both pod and ets show more similar spatial patterns at a basin scale the order of basins from highest to lowest in evaluation of drought estimates are different from the results in figs 2 and 4 this can be explained by the fact that the evaluations of soil moistures estimates and their ssmi indices include the whole range of values but this evaluation of drought estimates consider only a range of the lowest values time series of the drought area percentages are calculated for each of the four river basins for 1982 2016 in fig 7 the drought area percentages from the four soil moisture products are evaluated against the asos spi 1 in terms of r and rmse values as expected kldas shows the best performance in all river basins the order of evaluation metrics r and rmse from highest to lowest is the similar order as both evaluations in figs 4 and 6 but fldas slightly outperforms gldas except in the geum river basin overall kldas and fldas provide higher r 0 63 and lower rmse 17 values in all four river basins it is interesting to note that overestimation of the agricultural drought areas is found in the nakdong river and yeongsan river basins during 1982 200 in the gldas products which leads to produce lower performance than the other han river and geum river basins all four major river basins also appear to experience periodic droughts related to the impact of regional monsoon circulation over the east asia ssmi from kldas shows that these basins have wet status with lower drought area percentages 20 for years 1983 1987 1990 1991 1993 1998 1999 2002 2007 2010 2011 2013 and dry status with higher drought area percentages 40 for years 1982 1988 1994 2001 2015 in fig 7 the most recent 2015 drought event leads to the highest drought area percentage 74 of the han river basin and 69 of the geum river basin in the past 35 years for our study period 4 conclusions regional land surface models are required to facilitate continuous hydrological monitoring for the analysis of droughts and their characteristics of spatial variation intensity and frequency under climate change but model based soil moisture has not been fully served as an agricultural drought index to monitor long term drought conditions in south korea in this study we describe the development of a 0 01 resolution ldas using the noah mp model with the added value of local precipitation forcing dataset and high resolution soil texture maps in south korea where rugged topography and heterogeneous land covers make coarse resolution lsm and satellite retrieval difficult to capture agricultural droughts this study examines the potential of kldas soil moisture estimates for long term drought monitoring during crop growing seasons for 1982 2016 the kldas soil moisture estimates are evaluated using two reference datasets 3 year in situ soil moisture measurements and 35 year observed precipitation based spi 1 also we employ gldas fldas and esa cci as benchmark datasets and intercompare them with kldas because these soil moisture products have been investigated for good quality drought monitoring in other regions these datasets are the only available resource to provide long term soil moisture estimates over south korea kldas outperforms the benchmark soil moisture estimates and their drought estimates in south korea for drought detectability kldas has higher pod and ets than the other ldas and satellite retrieval products in all four major river basins the gpcp used to force gldas and chirps used to force fldas datasets are under and overestimated than the observation based asos dataset in south korea for 1982 2016 particularly during wet seasons the gldas and esa cci products show the lowest performance in the metropolitan area with heterogeneous land covers this work suggests that improved precipitation soil texture maps and model spatial resolution are crucial for agricultural drought estimation over south korea esa cci shows the second best in the recent soil moisture estimates against in situ measurements for a shorter period of time 2013 2015 but our results indicate that the esa cci products are not feasible for long term drought monitoring over south korea due to lower data quality for early periods 1979 1991 of the esa cci merged product from a basin scale perspective the nakdong river basin in the southeast of south korea shows the best results in the soil moisture estimation for 2013 2015 because the mid eastern region is high in elevation with rugged topography and the western and southern regions are more occupied with cropland where irrigation modules need to be considered but were not included by any of these ldas products improved forcing datasets and additional model development can meet the full potential of the kldas as agricultural drought monitoring tools currently the other asos meteorological forcing datasets i e wind air temperature pressure humidity than the precipitation are being processed into a 0 01 gridded data and are set to force high resolution kldas coupled with a river routing scheme getirana et al 2012 2017 assimilating land surface data into lsms can improve poorly represented processes over irrigated and vegetation covered areas kumar et al 2015 jung et al 2019 which cannot be supported by simpler models and ground observation based spi and ssmi approaches in addition to the enhanced drought monitoring system kldas is expected to provide important information on water resources as a valuable tool for key stakeholders to manage natural resources and develop water supply guidelines and best practices in south korea credit authorship contribution statement hahn chul jung writing original draft conceptualization methodology
