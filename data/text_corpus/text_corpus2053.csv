10265,the estimation of reference evapotranspiration et0 is crucial to estimate crop water requirements especially in developing countries and areas with scarce water resources in these regions the impossibility of collecting all the required data to compute fao 56 penman monteith equation fao56 pm makes scientists search new methodologies to accurately estimate et0 with the minimum number of climatic parameters in this work several neural network approaches have been evaluated for estimating et0 using datasets from five weather stations located in southern spain semiarid region of andalusia the assessment of statistical performance root mean square error rmse mean bias error mbe coefficient of determination r2 and nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nse of models namely multilayer perceptron mlp generalized regression neural network grnn extreme learning machine elm support vector machines svm random forest rf and xgboost were carried out using different input variables configurations only temperature based data were used as inputs the calculation of new variables called energyt the integral of the half hourly temperature values of a day and hourmin the difference in hours between time sunset and the time when the maximum temperature occurs had promising results for the most humid stations the good results obtained with energyt when it is used as an input of the system demonstrated that the information contained on it gives detailed characterization of the daily thermic behavior at each location resulting in a more efficient model than those using only daily maximum minimum temperature and extraterrestrial radiation values in general the modeling results showed that no model firmly outperformed the others although mlp and elm were commonly the models that gave the best performances for all sites mean values of r2 0 89 mean values of nse 0 88 mean values of rmse 0 67 mm day and mean values of mbe ranging from 0 17 to 0 30 mm day therefore energyt and hourmin can be used to estimate et0 more accurately in stations where data acquisition is limited like in developing countries or at low cost weather stations that cannot collect all the required meteorological variables used in fao56 pm overall the use of elm is recommended due to its high performance in terms of efficiency nse for all the configurations and for all locations especially using energyt as an input variable keywords irrigation scheduling machine learning reference evapotranspiration 1 introduction food supply guarantee for an exponential growth population under climate change is one of the major challenges to our current society besides this fact is accentuated under pandemic conditions as we have suffered worldwide during a great part of 2020 due to covid 19 for the hydrological cycle and agronomic process reference evapotranspiration et0 is one of the most important accurate calculation of et0 is crucial to water resource management and irrigation scheduling especially in semiarid areas such as andalusia region southern spain it determines the evaporative demand of the atmosphere in a hypothetical grass reference crop with specific characteristics which makes this parameter affected only by climatic conditions allen et al 1998 several statistical methodologies have been studied over the world although the fao 56 penman monteith fao56 pm equation is considered by the food and agricultural organization of the united nations fao as the sole reference mathematical method pereira et al 2015 it is proved to be a high accuracy globally method in different climatic conditions córdova et al 2015 debnath et al 2015 estévez et al 2009 gavilán et al 2008 itenfisu et al 2003 another well accepted method in both practical and researching applications is the asce pm asce ewri 2005 being identical to fao56 pm on a daily basis these methods are physics based and the required parameters are the air temperature the relative humidity of the air the solar radiation the wind speed the atmospheric pressure and the soil heat flux unfortunately the implementation and maintenance of weather stations that collect these meteorological data are very expensive even for developed countries therefore it is not always possible to find locations where all these parameters are recorded being specially true for developing countries where reliable data of wind speed and solar radiation are missing eccel 2012 estévez et al 2012 paola and giugni 2013 wmo 2018 due to these restrictions simplified statistical equations with fewer input climatic parameters can be used to estimate et0 allen et al 1998 proposed that when not enough data are available to solve fao56 pm equation it could be considered using the hargreaves samani hs equation hargreaves and samani 1985 which only requires maximum and minimum daily temperature tx and tn and extraterrestrial solar radiation ra that can be approximated using latitude and the day of the year several articles have studied the performance of hs model in different countries and the improvement of its accuracy with local calibration gavilán et al 2006 khoob 2007 martı nez cob and tejero juste 2004 ravazzani et al 2012 tang et al 2018 trajkovic 2005 vanderlinden et al 2004 for example martı nez cob and tejero juste 2004 analyzed this method for semi arid climates in the north of spain vanderlinden et al 2004 compared different approaches between inland and coastal weather stations in the south of spain trajkovic 2005 studied seven weather stations located in serbia gavilán et al 2006 carried out a regional calibration of hs method in andalusia region todorovic et al 2013 analyzed the efficiency of hs in 577 weather stations in 16 mediterranean countries one of the compelling reasons for using this equation extensively is that there are so many weather stations that record temperature data and their installation and maintenance are the cheapest even though hs method is the most common worldwide there are several methodologies to calculate et0 using limited climatic data blaney 1952 and thornthwaite and mather 1957 among other equations use temperature as the only input data to obtain et0 even fao 56 pereira et al 2015 contemplates a temperature based approach using approximations to the actual vapor pressure ea the solar radiation rs and a local long term average of the wind speed u2 schendel 1967 made a contribution using temperature and relative humidity whereas priestley and taylor 1972 and bristow and campbell 1984 introduced solar radiation and temperature in their solutions numerous articles studied and compared these methods at different locations and climatic conditions as germany bormann 2010 ghana acheampong 1986 switzerland xu and singh 2000 north america great plains mckenney and rosenberg 1993 or spain moratiel et al 2020 in the last decade advances in computation have led to the introduction of machine learning ml methodologies in the reference evapotranspiration calculation proving its high accuracy results by using different approaches several ml models have been studied such as multilayer perceptron mlp jahanbani and el shafie 2011 kumar et al 2002 martí et al 2010 wang et al 2008 support vector machine svm fan et al 2018 ferreira et al 2019 guo et al 2011 kisi 2013 shrestha and shukla 2015 tabari et al 2012 wen et al 2015 decision tree dt and ensemble learning models fan et al 2018 feng et al 2017a kisi and kilic 2016 pal and deswal 2009 rahimikhoob 2014 extreme learning machine

neural networks cnn ferreira and da cunha 2020 and another techniques such as gene expression programming gep shiri et al 2012 shiri et al 2014 and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis karimaldini et al 2012 keshtegar et al 2018 shiri et al 2012 shiri et al 2014 tabari et al 2012 the use of limited climatic data is a common practice among scientists when analyzing different ml architectures and models in this sense tabari et al 2012 studied and compared daily et0 with anfis svms regression analysis versus empirical models hargreaves samani ritchie jensen haise turc blaney criddle in a semi arid highland environment of iran these different models were tested with temperature based parameters however to improve each model s accuracy new climatological parameters such as solar radiation relative humidity and wind speed were introduced the best results were obtained with anfis and the use of mean temperature solar radiation relative humidity and wind speed wen et al 2015 used svm and mlp to model et0 with limited climatic data in extremely arid regions in china one of the most arid zone in the world comparing results to empirical models such as priestley taylor and hargreaves the most accurate model was svm using temperature solar radiation and wind speed feng et al 2017b analyzed the performance of the elm and grnn models in 6 meteorological stations of sichuan basin southwest china using only temperature data elm outperformed grnn adamala 2018 studied the performance of wavelet neural networks wnn in different climatological regions of india using only maximum and minimum temperature and contrasted it with mlp linear regression lr and wavelet regression wr even though wnn yielded good results mlp gave a better performance ferreira and da cunha 2020 compared ann rf xgboost and cnn using different approaches of hourly temperature relative humidity and extraterrestrial solar radiation values being cnn model the most precise solution in general the introduction of new climatic parameters such as relative humidity solar radiation and or wind speed is a common practice to improve the accuracy in all different models and regions these introductions constraint to the installation of new sensors which is very expensive in both installation and maintenance for example the installation of 10 new automated weather stations aws in ghana in 2019 cost around 450 000 norman 2019 moreover the technological improvements on the internet of things iot the huge number of devices connected to the internet and its availability with new technologies like 5g connections led to a new important role of low cost and non conventional devices into aws the data storage is cheaper nowadays enabling aws to increase the sampling rate from days to minutes and the use of new available low cost air temperature sensors with open source hardware like raspberry or arduino is escalating worldwide with great results in terms of accuracy nsabagwa et al 2019 strigaro et al 2019 however despite the existence of new sensors of other climatic parameters such as wind speed or relative humidity their performances are not as good yet mesas carrascosa et al 2015 nsabagwa et al 2019 strigaro et al 2019 therefore due to the promising results obtained by ferreira and da cunha 2020 in brazil with the use of sub daily temperature data the present work studies the performance of different ml models with new approaches and using novel daily parameters energyt and hourmin exclusively obtained from air half hourly temperature measurements the main objectives of this work are i the assessment of different temperature based ml models mlp svm rf xgboost grnn and elm to estimate et0 in different sites located in the heterogeneous climatic region of andalusia southern spain ii the comparative analysis of the different configurations combinations of several input variables for each location and iii the performance evaluation in terms of seasonality for each model for these purposes five locations were selected based on their different geo climatic characteristics in the andalusia region eleven configurations for each neural network model were evaluated in order to analyze their performance at each location finally the temporal assessment seasonality of models performance was also studied it is important to note that no similar works have been carried out by using this kind of methods in southern spain moreover the bayesian optimization to determine the fittest machine learning hyperparameters architecture has been applied as a novel and efficient method instead of the traditional trial error procedure widely used in et0 modeling i e feng et al 2017a 2017b ferreira et al 2019 and ferreira and da cunha 2020 2 materials and methods 2 1 source of data this study is carried out in the region of andalusia located in the south west of europe and the south of the iberian peninsula ranging the meridians from 1º to 7ºw the parallels from 37º to 39ºn and an elevation from 26 to 822 m above mean sea level in a total area of 87 268 km2 fig 1 the climate is semiarid where inland locations have torrid summers and harsh winters whereas on the coast the temperature is slightly more temperate on the other hand mountainous locations are rainy and quite cold during the winter estévez et al 2020 the datasets used in this work belong to the agroclimatic information network of andalusia riaa which can be downloaded at https www juntadeandalucia es agriculturaypesca ifapa ria servlet frontcontroller five stations were selected to represent the different variability of climatic conditions of the region in terms of the unep aridity index unep 1992 ranging from 0 178 in tabernas to 0 555 in aroche stations and including coastal and inland locations the coordinates and other characteristics of the automated weather stations used in this work are reported in table 1 while in fig 2 it is shown the monthly variation of mean daily temperature relative humidity wind speed and solar radiation of these weather stations available datasets are divided into two main groups according to its sampling time semi hourly and daily sampling data on semi hourly datasets also called the intraday datasets the temperature relative humidity wind speed and radiation are recorded every 30 min on daily data we find the maximum mean and minimum temperature tx tm tn respectively the maximum mean and minimum relative humidity rhx rhm rhn respectively the maximum and mean wind speed ux u respectively the total solar radiation rs the total precipitation preci and the time of day when maximum temperature and minimum temperature occurs hourmintx and hourmintn table 2 shows the statistics values of these datasets the period of the datasets ranges from april 2000 to july 2018 for daily and semi hourly data the datasets were split into training and testing the period from 2000 to 2014 was selected as training data whereas the period from 2014 to 2018 was chosen as testing ferreira et al 2020 and estévez et al 2020 the reason why a hold out technique is applied instead of a cross validation is that the dataset of this work is large composed of 18 years so the risk of overfitting due to short datasets is low hossein kazemi et al 2020 and shiri et al 2019 apart from this split a validation dataset was needed to check the performance of different hyperparameter sets in the process of searching the fittest tuning for each model a random 15 from the training data was used for this purpose the reason for taking a random period was to validate the performance in random years and days of the year additionally the seed of the random function was always the same making all the validation dataset period identical one another once the fittest tuning the most promising architecture and set of hyperparameter values on the training and validation datasets was found the whole training data was applied to train the model and eventually the testing dataset was used to obtain the performances 2 2 quality assurance procedures in order to guarantee reliable results the application of several quality control procedures to raw datasets was carried out all this process is focused on identifying erroneous and questionable sensor measurements following the guidelines proposed by estévez et al 2011 as a set of quality procedure checking tests range test internal consistency step test and persistence test and the spatial consistency test estévez et al 2018 the application of these quality assurance techniques has been successfully carried out under different climatic conditions worldwide estévez et al 2016 islam et al 2019 yi et al 2018 2 3 fao56 pm equation despite the differences between lysimeters measures and fao pm et0 estimates martí et al 2015 a the use fao pm et0 method is a common and accepted practice by numerous previous works under different climatic conditions wang et al 2008 estévez et al 2016 althoff et al 2019 ferreira et al 2020 moratiel et al 2020 computations of et 0 were carried out according to the standardized asce fao56 pm equation allen et al 1998 and they were used as target values 1 et 0 0 408 r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a γ 1 0 34 u 2 where et 0 is the standardized grass reference evapotranspiration mm day 1 is the slope of the saturation vapor pressure versus temperature curve kpa c 1 r n is the net radiation calculated at the crop surface mj m 2 day 1 g is the soil heat flux density at the soil surface mj m 2 day 1 which is assumed to be zero for daily values t is the mean daily air temperature º c u 2 is the mean daily wind speed at 2 m height m s 1 e s and e a are the saturation vapor pressure and the mean actual vapor pressure respectively kp a γ is the psychrometric constant kpa c 1 and 0 408 is a coefficient mj 1 m 2 mm the specification of the sensor used to calculate reference evapotranspiration in the assessed stations from riaa is shown in table 3 2 4 temperature based methods the main disadvantage of fao56 pm as previously mentioned is that the required weather data are normally unavailable or of low quality in many sites worldwide in this sense allen et al 1998 in the guidelines for fao56 pm recommended two different methods hargreaves samani hs and the fao56 computation using only temperature data fao56 pmt hs is calculated according to eq 2 2 et 0 hs 0 0023 t m 17 8 t x t n r a where et0 hs is the et0 calculated through this method in mm day 1 0 0023 is an empirical coefficient tx tm tn are the maximum mean and minimum air temperature c respectively and ra is the extraterrestrial radiation mj m 2 day 1 calculated from the day of the year and the latitude in addition this method can be locally calibrated to improve its performance et 0 hsmod is mathematically expressed as eq 3 3 et 0 hsmod m t m n t x t n r a where m and n are the calibration coefficients from hargreaves and samani 1985 which need to be adjusted for site specific conditions of the different stations using fao56 pm as a reference instead of using the general values of 0 0023 and 17 8 respectively although other methods such as the one proposed by shiri et al 2015 could be useful to locally calibrate the coefficients of hs the conventional procedure is adequate in cases where enough years are available on the dataset on the other way fao56 pmt is the application of fao56 pm using only temperature data and approximations to relative humidity rh and solar radiation by using air temperature wind speed u 2 is usually set to 2 m s 1 or regional mean values the mean saturation vapor pressure es actual vapor pressure ea and vapor pressure deficit vpd are estimated with eqs 4 5 and 6 respectively dew temperature t dew is estimated according to todorovic et al 2013 where different approaches from tn are carried out depending on the aridity table 3 4 e s 0 6108 2 exp 17 27 t x t x 237 3 exp 17 27 t

longitude latitude and date hourminsunset hourmintx hourmin is the difference in hours between sunset and the time where tx occurred eq 7 and energyt is considered as the area below the temperature of a whole day as it can be seen in fig 3 which is determined by eq 8 where ti is the temperature every half hour in a day from 00 00 23 30 for example t0 is the temperature at 00 00 and t1 is the temperature at 00 30 7 hourmin hourmin sunset hourmin t x hours 8 energy t i 1 48 t i 1 t i 0 5 c h o u r s 2 5 machine learning models all machine learning models were implemented on python using the following libraries keras chollet 2015 scikit learn pedregosa et al 2011 scikit optimize head et al 2020 tensorflow abadi et al 2015 xgboost chen and guestrin 2016 neupy and hpelm akusok et al 2015 all computations were running in a server workstation over anaconda 3 7 with the following features 2x intel xeon cpu e5 2650 v3 2 30 ghz and 128 gb of ram the models ann svm rf xgboost grnn and elm used in this study are detailed below as well as the hyperparameters optimization in section 2 5 7 2 5 1 multilayer perceptron mlp a neural network nn model is a data processing system inspired by the biological nervous system of the human brain it is composed of a large number of interconnected neurons working on the purpose of solving a specific problem in our case for estimating reference evapotranspiration using only temperature parameters as inputs all nn models have three different layers input hidden and output layer the input layer corresponds to the data our system can use to resolve a problem whereas the output represents the results the hidden layer is usually called as a black box because its processes are not controlled and its functionality is modified itself by an auto training method a single hidden layer and a single neuron model is called perceptron fig a1 eq 9 represents the mathematical expression of a general perceptron with different inputs where xi represents the different inputs i of our system wi are the weights that multiply each input to a corresponding neuron b is a bias value f is an activation function and y is the output 9 y f i 1 n w i x i b besides multiple hidden layers with one or more neurons each is called multilayer perceptron mlp and their architecture is represented in the appendix fig a2 the f is responsible for whether a neuron should be activated or not the activation functions used in this work have been sigmoid tanh and relu fig a3 the most important part of mlp is the learning process which is called back propagation where the results given by the model are introduced in a cost function and the weights are updated every epoch to minimize it this updating process can be carried out by several optimizers in this study the optimizers sgd stochastic gradient descent rmsprop root mean square prop and adam adaptive moment estimation have been used the sgd optimizer is the most used due to its simplicity and good results rmsprop optimizer is like gradient descent with momentum the difference lays on how the gradients are calculated eventually the adam is a combination of rmsprop and sgd descent with momentum using the squared gradients to scale the learning rate like rmsprop and taking the momentum by using moving average of the gradient for more detailed information about these optimizers hinton et al 2012 kingma and ba 2014 sutskever et al 2013 can be consulted finally the hyperparameters introduced into optimization are the number of neurons of the first hidden layer from 1 to 20 neurons the number of neurons of the other hidden layers from 1 to 20 the number of hidden layers from 1 to 4 the activation sigmoid tanh and relu the optimizer function sgd rmsprop and adam and the number of epochs from 1 to 100 2 5 2 extreme leaning machine elm despite the good results given by mlp in reference evapotranspiration the high computational cost of the learning process made scientists study new approaches huang et al 2006 proposed a single hidden layer feedforward neural network slfnns where the weights and biases of the hidden layer are randomly generated and not tuned and the output weights and bias are analytically calculated as a result the model obtained has a very low computational cost because no iteration learning process is required even if the number of neurons is less than the number of inputs the hidden node parameters of elm should not be tuned throughout training being able to learn distinct samples with good results abdullah et al 2015 feng et al 2017b fogocic et al 2016 the hyperparameters introduced into optimization are the number of neurons of the hidden layer from 1 to 1000 and its activation function 2 5 3 generalized regression neural network grnn generalized regression neural networks grnn was first proposed by specht 1991 as a modification of a radial basis function network rbfn grnn models are based on nonlinear regression estimation functions and its structure is composed of four layers the input layer the pattern layer the summation layer and the output layer fig 4 each neuron of the pattern layer represents a training input pattern and its output is a measure of the distance of the input from the stored patterns the summation layer is composed of two different kinds of nodes the s nodes and the d node represented by s and d in fig 4 the number of s nodes is the same as the number of outputs and it computes the sum of the weighted outputs of the pattern layer each node is connected to its correspondent output on the contrary the d node is connected to all outputs and it calculates the unweighted outputs of the pattern layer the calculation of each output is the division between the output of each s node by the d node output yielding the estimated value fig 4 the mathematical expression of the output is represented in eqs 10 and 11 10 y i i 1 n w i exp g x x i i 1 n exp g x x i 11 g x x i j 1 m x x j σ 2 where y i is the predicted value to an unknown input vector x xi is the input training vector w i is the weight connection between the ith neuron n and m are the numbers of training patterns and the number of elements of an input vector respectively g is the gaussian function and σ is a hyperparameter that modifies the width of the gaussian function firat and gungor 2009 the special feature of grnns is that it does not require an iterate training procedure because the local minima problem was not faced during development specht 1991 making this model the fastest and with a low error performance feng et al 2017a 2017b kisi and kilic 2016 this algorithm is designed by neupy python library where the only hyperparameter to modify is σ with a range of 0 0001 5 0 2 5 4 support vector machine svm support vector machine is a machine learning technique that covers classification svm and regression svr alike the main idea of svm which is extrapolated to svr is to linearly separate two or more classes with a hyperplane where the margins are maximized in fig 5 there is a graphical summary of support vectors for classification a and regression b the optimization problem is mathematically expressed as eq 12 or by lagrange function as eqs 13 and 14 12 min 1 2 w 2 s t y i x i w b 1 0 i 13 l w b α 1 2 w 2 i 1 m α i y i x i w b 1 14 m i n w m a x b α l w b α s t α i 0 i 1 m where w is the weight vector x i is the input vector b is the bias y i is the actual class value of the input and α is the lagrange multiplier an important aspect is the use of kernel functions to enable support vectors to operate in a high dimensional feature x space the definition is given a mapping function x v we call the function k x r defined by k x x x x v where v denotes an inner product in v a kernel function vapnik 2000 the different kernels we can find in scikit learn are linear kernel k x x x x polynomial kernel k x x x x c d sigmoid kernel k x x tanh x x c and rbf or gaussian kernel k x x exp γ x x 2 fig 6 shows an example for each kernel for further svr explanations see smola and schölkopf 2004 the hyperparameter used in optimization is the kernel function polynomial sigmoid and rbf c from 0 0001 to 1000 and ε from 0 0001 to 1000 the parameters c and ε correspond to the regularization parameter and the margin within no penalty is associated respectively 2 5 5 random forest rf random forest network is an ensemble tree based method proposed by breiman 2001 where trees are trained in a random subset and it can be used with bagging or pasting although is more common to use the first technique it also introduces extra randomness when the number of trees starts growing instead of searching the best feature to split a node it searches the best feature among a random subset of features resulting in greater tree diversity for further information feng et al 2017a can be consulted the hyperparameters tested in this work are the number of trees in the forest from 1 to 1000 the splitting criteria the mean square error o mean absolute error the maximum number of features considered to split a node of a tree one third one half three fourth the square root and the logarithm in base two of the number of features and the use of bagging or pasting the rest of the parameters are in default mode 2 5 6 xgboost it is a new machine learning model proposed by chen et al 2015 based on gradient boosting machines gbm and the classification and regression trees cart where a subset of weak learners are combined developing new stronger learners through the introduction of training strategies the main idea of boosting methods is to train models sequentially where each model try to reduce the error of the predecessor the objective of xgboost is reducing the computational cost while preventing overfitting thanks to the capacity of executing parallel calculations the hyperparameters introduced in the optimization process are the number of trees in the forest from 1 to 1000 the learning rate from 0 0001 to 1 the maximum depth of a tree from 1 to 30 the subsample ratio of the training instances setting it to 0 5 means that xgboost would randomly sample half of the training data before growing trees and this will prevent overfitting from 0 01 to 0 999 the subsample ratio of columns when constructing each tree 1 3 1 2 3 4 and 1 and the objective function regression with squared loss and regression with squared log loss 2 5 7 bayesian hyperparameter optimization the aim of hyperparameter optimization inside machine learning consists of finding a hyperparameter set for a given machine learning model that returns the most accurate performance on the validation dataset and likely it will outperform in the testing dataset for example for a typical multilayer perceptron mlp model it is very common to search for the number of hidden layers the number of neurons in those layers the learning rate or the optimizer function among others hyperparameter optimization is mathematically represented as follows eq 15 15 x arg min f x x x where f x represents the objective function we want to minimize for example the mean absolute error between predicted values and measured values x is the optimized set of hyperparameters and x represents the whole hyperparameter space the first approach is to manually change parameters based on experience and previous results until a good set is found known as manual tuning sometimes it could yield good results although not the best but in many other cases it could lead to a local minimum which could be far from the global as a second solution automatic methods such as grid or random search could be used having slightly better results than manual tuning because all this process is automatically carried out in a loop however they are completely blind to past evaluations and as a result they often spend a significant amount of time evaluating bad parameters bayesian optimization emerged as an efficient solution to these problems močkus 1975 it is an algorithm that uses the bayes theorem to search the minimum of an objective function the followed procedure is 1 a defined number of points from the hyperparameter space are tested 2 the algorithm considers past evaluations when selecting the next hyperparameters to evaluate acquisition function enabling itself to focus on those areas of the parameter space that are believed to bring promising validation scores 3 this new hyperparameter set is evaluated and 4 if the optimization has not finished it goes to the second point roughly in terms of machine learning it could be defined as the automatic method of manual tuning due to its similarity to human behavior while tuning borji and itti 2013 shahriari et al 2016 three major choices must be made to select a prior over functions that will express assumptions about the function being optimized in our case the gaussian process gp prior due to its flexibility the acquisition function determining the posterior model and allowing us to determine the next point to evaluate snoek et al 2012 in fig 7 it can be seen as an example of the bayesian optimization process for gp finally it is necessary to select which hyperparameters are used and their limits in this aspect several ranges of hyperparameters were chosen by trial and error snoek et al 2012 it is important to realize that the bigger the limits the bigger the number of epochs the algorithm needs to get the most accurate set of parameters and the longer the computational cost this is the reason why choosing a sensible range is very important to the efficiency of the optimization besides this methodology should be carried out using the training dataset whereas the final neural network architecture will be assessed by the testing dataset these data cannot influence the training or tuning processes which is in line with works like feng et al 2017a 2017b ferreira et al 2019 and ferreira and da cunha 2020 however using the testing dataset to tune the fittest architecture and a hyperparameter set is not recommended because it conducts the results to a bias on testing data which alienates from the main goal of generalization the specific limits and hyperparameters were previously defined for each model whereas the number of epochs for the optimization was set to 500 being 50 epochs randomly selected for further information about bayesian optimization and gaussian processes see shahriari et al 2016 2 6 data standardization standardization of input datasets is a common requirement among all neural network models in exception of tree based models and it can be expressed as eq 16 16 x stand x x σ where x stand is the data standardized x is the input data x is the mean of the training input dataset and σ is the standard deviation of the training input dataset 2 7 statistical analysis the model performances were evaluated by using the following parameters root mean square error rmse mean bias error mbe the coefficient of determination r 2 and the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nse the rmse mbe r2 and nse are defined as eqs 17 18 19 and 20 17 rmse 1 n i 1 n x i y i 2 18 mbe 1 n i 1 n x i y i 19 r 2 i 1 n x i x y i y 2 i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 20 nse 1 i 1 n x i y i 2 i 1 n x i x 2 where n is the number of records the bar denotes the mean and y and x are the predicted and fao56 pm et 0 values respectively 3 results and discussion in order to avoid not promising configurations a previous evaluation was carried out in the weather station of córdoba with different combinations of tx tn ra energy t e s e a vpd t dew and hourmin where 11 configurations from 3 to 6 inputs were chosen tx tn ra were always selected in all the configurations due to its high efficiency the rest of the combinations were excluded because no significant improvements were shown finally these selected 11 input configurations table 5 were assessed at each location and for all models 3 1 performance of models in the different locations in terms of the statistics mbe rmse r2 and nse their minimum mean and maximum values are summarized in table 6 for all the configurations of the different studied models at each station in córdoba aridity index 0 4616 in terms of rmse the mean values of all ml models 0 5249 mm day improved the performance of hsmod 0 6071 mm day and hs 0 6460 mm day the best rmse performance 0 4983 mm day was carried out by svm whereas the worst among ml models was carried out by grnn 0 5691 mm day so close to xgboost 0 5620 mm day on average the model with the best performance was svm having the mean rmse value of 0 5068 mm day very close to elm 0 5145 mm day regarding nse its behavior was like rmse where all ml performances the worst value was 0 9427 obtained by grnn outperformed hsmod 0 9348 the most precise model was again svm 0 9561 followed by mlp 0 9557 and elm 0 9545 the ranking on mean values is almost identical where svm maintain the first place but mlp and elm switch their positions with the values 0 9546 0 9532 and 0 9510 respectively the minimum mbe value 0 0006 mm day of all the assessed models was obtained with mlp it also got the worst value among ml models 0 1931 mm day although on average the best performance was carried out by svm with a mean of 0 0073 mm day the r2 values were very satisfactory for all models ranging from 0 9434 grnn to 0 9565 mlp even in hs 0 9366 and hsmod 0 9358 in málaga aridity index 0 3666 in terms of nse the efficiency performance obtained by all the studied models outperformed hs 0 8791 and hsmod 0 8824 their values ranged from 0 8916 xgboost to 0 9091 mlp and the mean among all ml models was 0 8995 mlp elm and svm overpassed the 0 9 performance in mean whereas all models except for xgboost exceeded it with their best configuration besides regarding rmse the values were also better than those obtained by hargreaves methods being the best mean values obtained by elm 0 6173 mm day mlp 0 6189 mm day and svm 0 6243 mm day in this order mlp outperformed the rest of the models with the best rmse value 0 5952 mm day on the other hand xgboost got the worst performance with a rmse value of 0 6512 mm day which keeps being better than those obtained by hs 0 6876 mm day or hsmod 0 6781 mm day regarding r2 the results of ml models outperformed hs and hsmod however the mbe values were worse on average with exception of elm grnn and rf the best value was obtained in both cases by mlp mbe 0 0732 mm day and r2 0 9105 in tabernas which is the station with the lowest aridity index 0 178 the rmse ranged from 0 6210 mm day elm to 0 7109 mm day mlp this last model and configuration was the only one that did not outperform hsmod rmse 0 7011 mm from all the models assessed elm was the one with the smallest minimum mean and maximum rmse values 0 6210 0 6532 and 0 6722 mm day respectively concerning nse its values ranged from 0 8767 mlp to 0 9059 elm being 0 8767 the unique value that did not outperform hsmod 0 8800 on average the model performance raking in both nse and rmse is elm mlp rf grnn xgboost and svm in this order in addition the mbe value reached its minimum 0 0015 mm day with mlp and configuration 9 and on average the value obtained using hsmod 0 0728 mm was outperformed by all the models except for svm and xgboost finally the r2 obtained a very similar behavior to nse but in this case all ml models outperformed hs and hsmod in conil aridity index 0 4790 the best models regarding rmse and nse were mlp rmse 0 5853 mm day and nse 0 8967 rf rmse 0 5859 mm day and nse 0 8965 and grnn rmse 0 5884 mm day and nse 0 8956 in contrast the worst model performances were elm rmse 0 6721 mm day and nse 0 8637 mlp rmse 0 6619 mm day and nse 0 8679 and xgboost rmse 0 6581 mm day and nse 0 8694 in this coastal location moreover the ml models obtained the most significant improvements against hsmod and hs over the other stations the r2 behavior was in line with nse but the mbe of ml models did not outperform hs 0 0683 mm day which was one of the best apart from mlp 0 0048 mm day a main feature of mbe is that all results were negative which means that all models overestimated et0 finally in aroche which is the most humid location aridity index 0 555 the values of r2 and nse using hsmod and all evaluated models were very satisfactory being both statistics higher than 0 9 for all the cases according to rmse the best results were obtained by mlp 0 4592 mm day followed by elm 0 4800 mm day however on average svm had the highest accurate estimations 0 5134 mm day followed very close to xgboost and elm 0 5168 and 0 5179 mm day respectively being all of them lower than the obtained by hsmod on the other hand mbe denotes underestimations in all cases ranging from 0 1789 mm day with mlp to 0 4185 mm day using mlp comparing the performance of the different models in the different stations it could be stated that there was a high performance variability between models in the different stations mlp was usually one of the best models in most of the statistics however it usually also had one of the worst values there is a higher dependence on the chosen configuration which could lead to overfitting in some cases the elm and svm usually obtained very close or even better values than mlp apart from having a less scattered performance variance on the other hand rf and xgboost tree based models were in general the worst models in the different statistics the grnn and elm are the models with less computational requirements because they do not need any training process it could be stated that elm is the most adequate model to estimate et0 in these weather stations comparing results from different stations with very close mean annual et0 values table 2 córdoba and tabernas inland locations had very accurate mbe results while the coastal stations denoted an overestimation tendency in all models and configurations the rmse values obtained in málaga tabernas and conil stations were quite similar on average although tabernas had slightly worse values in all the different models on the other hand córdoba and aroche had the best results in terms of r2 and nse the results were in line with rmse córdoba and aroche had the best estimations with values around 0 95 in both locations but the rest of the stations were closer to 0 9 which keep being considered as a good performance 3 2 performance of the configurations in order to evaluate the results obtained between different configurations in each station and without any dependence on ml models the mean of the statistical indices rmse mbe r2 and nse of the different models using a specific configuration are shown in fig 8 in general the input configuration tx tn and ra configuration 1 performed rmse as the worst value in all the stations on the other hand the statistics mbe r2 and nse went along with this line in inland locations córdoba tabernas and aroche whereas in coastal stations málaga and conil not such bad performances were obtained using this configuration in some cases very satisfactory values were obtained in coastal locations such as mbe in conil and málaga and r2 and nse in conil the introduction of the energyt parameter in the inputs configurations 2 8 and 11 improved the performances in all the stations except for mbe in conil in málaga the lowest rmse and the highest nse values were obtained using configurations 11 followed by 2 and 8 moreover in conil the results obtained using configurations 2 7 and 6 were the best in terms of rmse and nse córdoba and aroche had on average the best r2 performance and the lowest variability using most configurations which is in contrast to the rest of the stations however the nse values obtained in córdoba surpassed the values obtained in aroche for all configurations on the other hand aroche had the highest mbe values which is the indication of a dominant underestimation tendency for all the configurations assessed in table 7 it is shown the best nse and rmse mm day values for all the stations in the different configurations in córdoba the best nse and rmse values were obtained using configuration 11 nse 0 9560 and rmse 0 4982 mm day and very close to configurations 8 nse 0 9553 and rmse 0 5026 mm day 3 nse 0 9551 and rmse 0 5038 mm day and 9 nse 0 9548 and rmse 0 5053 mm day in this order the only configuration that did not outperform configuration 1 using elm in terms of nse was configuration 10 using elm in málaga the two best results were given using configurations 5 rmse 0 6070 mm day 7 0 6084 mm day and 10 rmse 0 6089 mm day having very close values one another these configurations also obtained the best nse performances 0 9057 0 9053 and 0 9052 respectively on the contrary configurations 2 3 4 8 9 and 11 worsen configuration 1 in both nse and rmse in tabernas the configurations with energyt as inputs 2 8 and 11 gave the best statistics rmse 0 6272 mm day and nse 0 9034 rmse 0 6209 mm day and nse 0 9058 rmse 0 6267 mm day and nse 0 9012 respectively the worst values were obtained by the configuration 10 rmse 0 6610 mm day and nse 0 8933 and 1 rmse 0 6607 mm day and nse 0 8934 in conil the best configuration performances were 3 7 8 2 and 10 in this order the use of hourmin made the model obtain the most efficient estimation in this location and the use of energyt also outperformed configuration 1 finally in aroche all the configuration outperformed configuration 1 except for configuration 5 and 10 configurations 4 6 8 11 and 2 obtained the best rmse and nse values this station had the highest improvements in rmse from hs and hsmod while in conil it is obtained the highest nse outperforming in general it could be sum up that the use of temperature based variables outperformed configuration 1 the use of energyt is highly recommended due to its efficiency improvements on the other hand the use of hourmin did not have considerable gains in most of the assessed stations although the results in the less arid stations córdoba conil and aroche where the aridity index is above 0 45 outperform from the use of tx tn and ra this value varies more in these stations due to a more frequent raining events 3 3 seasonal performance behavior regarding the performance of the models in different seasons fig 9 shows the statistical values of rmse mbe r2 and nse a b c and d respectively in terms of r2 winter had the worst results for all the studied models not only on average but also as the highest interquartile range whereas in autumn the highest precision was obtained regarding a ranking of general good performance the best results were obtained in autumn followed by spring and summer for both r2 and nse values on the other side the lowest r2 value 0 0976 resulted in málaga with elm and using configuration 8 also corresponding with the value nse 1 0066 rmse 0 9246 and mbe 0 1749 moreover mbe did not have any significant variability in the mean values due to seasons but the interquartile range was more compact in summer for all the models except for mlp and some outliers in aroche finally concerning rmse values the best performance was obtained using the mlp model in winter followed by the same approach in autumn regarding all the models and sites studied in spring and summer rmse values were lower than 0 9 mm in table 8 it is shown the different mean nse and rmse values along all models and stations to seasonally assess the performance of the different input configurations generally as it was stated in fig 9 the nse had better values in autumn whereas in winter the performance down to the worst in winter the best configurations were configuration 6 nse 0 4142 3 nse 0 4130 and 9 nse 0 4133 respectively in spring the best configurations were 2 nse 0 7603 8 nse 0 7572 and 11 nse 0 7538 in summer the results are very similar to spring where the best configurations are 2 nse 0 5675 3 nse 0 5658 8 nse 0 5600 and 11 nse 0 5550 finally in autumn there is no significant outperforming among the configurations is also the most accurate season in all cases the use of configurations with energyt and hourmin obtained significantly outperforms in winter spring and summer among all stations and models so the use of these variables is highly recommended to outperform temperature based models it is of interest that hourmin obtained significantly gains in winter where the rains are more frequent in these stations 3 4 overall discussion in general the results obtained by applying the proposed models outperformed the hargreaves methods and gave slightly better values of nse and r2 nse 0 82 and r2 0 83 for the local scenario and daily inputs and nse 0 89 and r2 0 90 for the local scenario and hourly inputs than those reported by ferreira and da cunha 2020 for ten weather stations in brazil 3 93 mm day of mean et0 although slightly worse in terms of mean rmse values rmse 0 53 for the local scenario and daily inputs and rmse 0 41 for the local scenario and hourly inputs however the rmse values obtained for most models were better than the results for temperature based models assessed by fan et al 2018 in several locations in china the et0 in the studied stations was ranging from 2 5 to 3 4 mm day in the different stations with a mean rmse performance of 0 7069 mm day with the temperature based models what is more the nse performance in all the stations with different climate condition semi arid arid sub humid and humid of india by adamala 2018 using wavelet neural networks wnn are lower than the mean nse values obtained in the assessed stations of andalusia the results of traore et al 2010 in the sudano sahelian zone gave similar mean r2 values in the temperature based models although the rmse values were lower in this zone besides the results of rf and gep obtained by karimi et al 2020 and shiri 2017 in iran using temperature based models were worst in terms of maximum and mean nse values than those obtained in these 5 stations of andalusia finally in terms of rmse and comparing the results with other studies carried out in spain the values were lower than those of landeras et al 2008 with mlp in the basque country northern spain and worse than the results of martí et al 2015 b with calibrated hs in eastern spain in general the computation cost of elm and grnn models were lower than using mlp xgboost and rf being the elm approach one of the best mean performance in all the stations assessed on the other hand rf and xgboost despite needing the most computational requirements and being slower on average it is not reflected that higher computational effort on training in the final results the good results obtained when using energyt as an input variable in any of the configurations 2 8 and 11 demonstrates that the information contained on it gives a detailed characterization of the thermic behavior at each location resulting in more efficient models than using only daily maximum and minimum temperature its use in inland stations showed one of the best performances while its use on coastal stations was not such substantial may be due to the effect of sea the temperature variability during a day is less affected by meteorological events on the other hand hourmin was also assessed with no such significant outperforming as energyt had but improving the modeling from the use of only tx tn and ra in the less arid stations aridity index above 0 45 of córdoba conil and aroche see table 1 another arising feature in this work is that the use of temperature based approximations of ea es vpd and tdew had improvements over the models using only configuration 1 although it is usually considered to be learned by the ml model in the training process the introduction of these parameters as input variables may help the model learn minimizing the possibility of overfitting occurrence therefore configurations using the new parameters energyt and hourmin can be used in this kind of models to estimate et0 more accurately being elm model the one that obtained in general the highest performances this is crucial in stations where the data acquisition is limited like developing countries or low cost weather stations that cannot collect the rest of the meteorological variables required by fao56 pm 4 conclusions different models using several meteorological temperature based parameters as input variables have been developed and assessed at five locations in the andalusia region southern spain covering different climatic conditions the main novelty of this work is the use of new meteorological parameters based on intra daily temperature variables energyt and hourmin the evaluation of different configurations the combination of other climatological parameters such as vpd ea es and tdew as inputs in the different approaches studied as well as the use of bayesian optimization to tune hyperparameters for each of them the results indicated that the use of the novel s temperature based parameters in these neural network approaches outperformed in general the estimations of et0 in all the assessed stations comparing to hargreaves methods and models using tx tn and ra in terms of rmse and r2 the values were reduced from 0 8264 mm day hsmod to 0 5853 mm day mlp and from 0 8182 hsmod to 0 9039 mlp respectively the improvement in the nse values was slightly better than in r2 increasing from 0 7939 hsmod to 0 8967 mlp finally the best improvement was obtained in the mbe statistic gaining from 0 2830 mm day hsmod to 0 0048 mm day mlp as a rule there is not a model that firmly outperforms the rest of the models in terms of mean statistics although mlp was usually the model that gave the best performance in most locations although its variability was high besides grnn and elm were the models with the lowest computational cost where elm performed with one of the best nse and rmse in most stations and configurations additionally based on the results obtained in this work it can be observed an improvement of the statistical performance by using energyt in any of the configurations assessed while using hourmin had improvements in the most humid stations where the aridity index is above 0 45 additionally in terms of seasonal performances the statistics obtained significantly outperforms in winter spring and summer among all stations and models therefore the elm model with energyt and hourmin can be used to improve limited climatic models to increase the accuracy of et0 estimations further studies can deeply explore these parameters and models for regional scenarios and in locations with different climatic conditions from those studied in this work due to the rise of low cost sensorization especially for variables such as air temperature and the possibility of collecting these records with a higher sampling frequency than the conventional daily scale the approaches proposed in this work may result in greater efficiency in the use of water resources funding this work was supported by the university of córdoba and the

10265,the estimation of reference evapotranspiration et0 is crucial to estimate crop water requirements especially in developing countries and areas with scarce water resources in these regions the impossibility of collecting all the required data to compute fao 56 penman monteith equation fao56 pm makes scientists search new methodologies to accurately estimate et0 with the minimum number of climatic parameters in this work several neural network approaches have been evaluated for estimating et0 using datasets from five weather stations located in southern spain semiarid region of andalusia the assessment of statistical performance root mean square error rmse mean bias error mbe coefficient of determination r2 and nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nse of models namely multilayer perceptron mlp generalized regression neural network grnn extreme learning machine elm support vector machines svm random forest rf and xgboost were carried out using different input variables configurations only temperature based data were used as inputs the calculation of new variables called energyt the integral of the half hourly temperature values of a day and hourmin the difference in hours between time sunset and the time when the maximum temperature occurs had promising results for the most humid stations the good results obtained with energyt when it is used as an input of the system demonstrated that the information contained on it gives detailed characterization of the daily thermic behavior at each location resulting in a more efficient model than those using only daily maximum minimum temperature and extraterrestrial radiation values in general the modeling results showed that no model firmly outperformed the others although mlp and elm were commonly the models that gave the best performances for all sites mean values of r2 0 89 mean values of nse 0 88 mean values of rmse 0 67 mm day and mean values of mbe ranging from 0 17 to 0 30 mm day therefore energyt and hourmin can be used to estimate et0 more accurately in stations where data acquisition is limited like in developing countries or at low cost weather stations that cannot collect all the required meteorological variables used in fao56 pm overall the use of elm is recommended due to its high performance in terms of efficiency nse for all the configurations and for all locations especially using energyt as an input variable keywords irrigation scheduling machine learning reference evapotranspiration 1 introduction food supply guarantee for an exponential growth population under climate change is one of the major challenges to our current society besides this fact is accentuated under pandemic conditions as we have suffered worldwide during a great part of 2020 due to covid 19 for the hydrological cycle and agronomic process reference evapotranspiration et0 is one of the most important accurate calculation of et0 is crucial to water resource management and irrigation scheduling especially in semiarid areas such as andalusia region southern spain it determines the evaporative demand of the atmosphere in a hypothetical grass reference crop with specific characteristics which makes this parameter affected only by climatic conditions allen et al 1998 several statistical methodologies have been studied over the world although the fao 56 penman monteith fao56 pm equation is considered by the food and agricultural organization of the united nations fao as the sole reference mathematical method pereira et al 2015 it is proved to be a high accuracy globally method in different climatic conditions córdova et al 2015 debnath et al 2015 estévez et al 2009 gavilán et al 2008 itenfisu et al 2003 another well accepted method in both practical and researching applications is the asce pm asce ewri 2005 being identical to fao56 pm on a daily basis these methods are physics based and the required parameters are the air temperature the relative humidity of the air the solar radiation the wind speed the atmospheric pressure and the soil heat flux unfortunately the implementation and maintenance of weather stations that collect these meteorological data are very expensive even for developed countries therefore it is not always possible to find locations where all these parameters are recorded being specially true for developing countries where reliable data of wind speed and solar radiation are missing eccel 2012 estévez et al 2012 paola and giugni 2013 wmo 2018 due to these restrictions simplified statistical equations with fewer input climatic parameters can be used to estimate et0 allen et al 1998 proposed that when not enough data are available to solve fao56 pm equation it could be considered using the hargreaves samani hs equation hargreaves and samani 1985 which only requires maximum and minimum daily temperature tx and tn and extraterrestrial solar radiation ra that can be approximated using latitude and the day of the year several articles have studied the performance of hs model in different countries and the improvement of its accuracy with local calibration gavilán et al 2006 khoob 2007 martı nez cob and tejero juste 2004 ravazzani et al 2012 tang et al 2018 trajkovic 2005 vanderlinden et al 2004 for example martı nez cob and tejero juste 2004 analyzed this method for semi arid climates in the north of spain vanderlinden et al 2004 compared different approaches between inland and coastal weather stations in the south of spain trajkovic 2005 studied seven weather stations located in serbia gavilán et al 2006 carried out a regional calibration of hs method in andalusia region todorovic et al 2013 analyzed the efficiency of hs in 577 weather stations in 16 mediterranean countries one of the compelling reasons for using this equation extensively is that there are so many weather stations that record temperature data and their installation and maintenance are the cheapest even though hs method is the most common worldwide there are several methodologies to calculate et0 using limited climatic data blaney 1952 and thornthwaite and mather 1957 among other equations use temperature as the only input data to obtain et0 even fao 56 pereira et al 2015 contemplates a temperature based approach using approximations to the actual vapor pressure ea the solar radiation rs and a local long term average of the wind speed u2 schendel 1967 made a contribution using temperature and relative humidity whereas priestley and taylor 1972 and bristow and campbell 1984 introduced solar radiation and temperature in their solutions numerous articles studied and compared these methods at different locations and climatic conditions as germany bormann 2010 ghana acheampong 1986 switzerland xu and singh 2000 north america great plains mckenney and rosenberg 1993 or spain moratiel et al 2020 in the last decade advances in computation have led to the introduction of machine learning ml methodologies in the reference evapotranspiration calculation proving its high accuracy results by using different approaches several ml models have been studied such as multilayer perceptron mlp jahanbani and el shafie 2011 kumar et al 2002 martí et al 2010 wang et al 2008 support vector machine svm fan et al 2018 ferreira et al 2019 guo et al 2011 kisi 2013 shrestha and shukla

karimaldini et al 2012 keshtegar et al 2018 shiri et al 2012 shiri et al 2014 tabari et al 2012 the use of limited climatic data is a common practice among scientists when analyzing different ml architectures and models in this sense tabari et al 2012 studied and compared daily et0 with anfis svms regression analysis versus empirical models hargreaves samani ritchie jensen haise turc blaney criddle in a semi arid highland environment of iran these different models were tested with temperature based parameters however to improve each model s accuracy new climatological parameters such as solar radiation relative humidity and wind speed were introduced the best results were obtained with anfis and the use of mean temperature solar radiation relative humidity and wind speed wen et al 2015 used svm and mlp to model et0 with limited climatic data in extremely arid regions in china one of the most arid zone in the world comparing results to empirical models such as priestley taylor and hargreaves the most accurate model was svm using temperature solar radiation and wind speed feng et al 2017b analyzed the performance of the elm and grnn models in 6 meteorological stations of sichuan basin southwest china using only temperature data elm outperformed grnn adamala 2018 studied the performance of wavelet neural networks wnn in different climatological regions of india using only maximum and minimum temperature and contrasted it with mlp linear regression lr and wavelet regression wr even though wnn yielded good results mlp gave a better performance ferreira and da cunha 2020 compared ann rf xgboost and cnn using different approaches of hourly temperature relative humidity and extraterrestrial solar radiation values being cnn model the most precise solution in general the introduction of new climatic parameters such as relative humidity solar radiation and or wind speed is a common practice to improve the accuracy in all different models and regions these introductions constraint to the installation of new sensors which is very expensive in both installation and maintenance for example the installation of 10 new automated weather stations aws in ghana in 2019 cost around 450 000 norman 2019 moreover the technological improvements on the internet of things iot the huge number of devices connected to the internet and its availability with new technologies like 5g connections led to a new important role of low cost and non conventional devices into aws the data storage is cheaper nowadays enabling aws to increase the sampling rate from days to minutes and the use of new available low cost air temperature sensors with open source hardware like raspberry or arduino is escalating worldwide with great results in terms of accuracy nsabagwa et al 2019 strigaro et al 2019 however despite the existence of new sensors of other climatic parameters such as wind speed or relative humidity their performances are not as good yet mesas carrascosa et al 2015 nsabagwa et al 2019 strigaro et al 2019 therefore due to the promising results obtained by ferreira and da cunha 2020 in brazil with the use of sub daily temperature data the present work studies the performance of different ml models with new approaches and using novel daily parameters energyt and hourmin exclusively obtained from air half hourly temperature measurements the main objectives of this work are i the assessment of different temperature based ml models mlp svm rf xgboost grnn and elm to estimate et0 in different sites located in the heterogeneous climatic region of andalusia southern spain ii the comparative analysis of the different configurations combinations of several input variables for each location and iii the performance evaluation in terms of seasonality for each model for these purposes five locations were selected based on their different geo climatic characteristics in the andalusia region eleven configurations for each neural network model were evaluated in order to analyze their performance at each location finally the temporal assessment seasonality of models performance was also studied it is important to note that no similar works have been carried out by using this kind of methods in southern spain moreover the bayesian optimization to determine the fittest machine learning hyperparameters architecture has been applied as a novel and efficient method instead of the traditional trial error procedure widely used in et0 modeling i e feng et al 2017a 2017b ferreira et al 2019 and ferreira and da cunha 2020 2 materials and methods 2 1 source of data this study is carried out in the region of andalusia located in the south west of europe and the south of the iberian peninsula ranging the meridians from 1º to 7ºw the parallels from 37º to 39ºn and an elevation from 26 to 822 m above mean sea level in a total area of 87 268 km2 fig 1 the climate is semiarid where inland locations have torrid summers and harsh winters whereas on the coast the temperature is slightly more temperate on the other hand mountainous locations are rainy and quite cold during the winter estévez et al 2020 the datasets used in this work belong to the agroclimatic information network of andalusia riaa which can be downloaded at https www juntadeandalucia es agriculturaypesca ifapa ria servlet frontcontroller five stations were selected to represent the different variability of climatic conditions of the region in terms of the unep aridity index unep 1992 ranging from 0 178 in tabernas to 0 555 in aroche stations and including coastal and inland locations the coordinates and other characteristics of the automated weather stations used in this work are reported in table 1 while in fig 2 it is shown the monthly variation of mean daily temperature relative humidity wind speed and solar radiation of these weather stations available datasets are divided into two main groups according to its sampling time semi hourly and daily sampling data on semi hourly datasets also called the intraday datasets the temperature relative humidity wind speed and radiation are recorded every 30 min on daily data we find the maximum mean and minimum temperature tx tm tn respectively the maximum mean and minimum relative humidity rhx rhm rhn respectively the maximum and mean wind speed ux u respectively the total solar radiation rs the total precipitation preci and the time of day when maximum temperature and minimum temperature occurs hourmintx and hourmintn table 2 shows the statistics values of these datasets the period of the datasets ranges from april 2000 to july 2018 for daily and semi hourly data the datasets were split into training and testing the period from 2000 to 2014 was selected as training data whereas the period from 2014 to 2018 was chosen as testing ferreira et al 2020 and estévez et al 2020 the reason why a hold out technique is applied instead of a cross validation is that the dataset of this work is large composed of 18 years so the risk of overfitting due to short datasets is low hossein kazemi et al 2020 and shiri et al 2019 apart from this split a validation dataset was needed to check the performance of different hyperparameter sets in the process of searching the fittest tuning for each model a random 15 from the training data was used for this purpose the reason for taking a random period was to validate the performance in random years and days of the year additionally the seed of the random function was always the same making all the validation dataset period identical one another once the fittest tuning the most promising architecture and set of hyperparameter values on the training and validation datasets was found the whole training data was applied to train the model and eventually the testing dataset was used to obtain the performances 2 2 quality assurance procedures in order to guarantee reliable results the application of several quality control procedures to raw datasets was carried out all this process is focused on identifying erroneous and questionable sensor measurements following the guidelines proposed by estévez et al 2011 as a set of quality procedure checking tests range test internal consistency step test and persistence test and the spatial consistency test estévez et al 2018 the application of these quality assurance techniques has been successfully carried out under different climatic conditions worldwide estévez et al 2016 islam et al 2019 yi et al 2018 2 3 fao56 pm equation despite the differences between lysimeters measures and fao pm et0 estimates martí et al 2015 a the use fao pm et0 method is a common and accepted practice by numerous previous works under different climatic conditions wang et al 2008 estévez et al 2016 althoff et al 2019 ferreira et al 2020 moratiel et al 2020 computations of et 0 were carried out according to the standardized asce fao56 pm equation allen et al 1998 and they were used as target values 1 et 0 0 408 r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a γ 1 0 34 u 2 where et 0 is the standardized grass reference evapotranspiration mm day 1 is the slope of the saturation vapor

zero for daily values t is the mean daily air temperature º c u 2 is the mean daily wind speed at 2 m height m s 1 e s and e a are the saturation vapor pressure and the mean actual vapor pressure respectively kp a γ is the psychrometric constant kpa c 1 and 0 408 is a coefficient mj 1 m 2 mm the specification of the sensor used to calculate reference evapotranspiration in the assessed stations from riaa is shown in table 3 2 4 temperature based methods the main disadvantage of fao56 pm as previously mentioned is that the required weather data are normally unavailable or of low quality in many sites worldwide in this sense allen et al 1998 in the guidelines for fao56 pm recommended two different methods hargreaves samani hs and the fao56 computation using only temperature data fao56 pmt hs is calculated according to eq 2 2 et 0 hs 0 0023 t m 17 8 t x t n r a where et0 hs is the et0 calculated through this method in mm day 1 0 0023 is an empirical coefficient tx tm tn are the maximum mean and minimum air temperature c respectively and ra is the extraterrestrial radiation mj m 2 day 1 calculated from the day of the year and the latitude in addition this method can be locally calibrated to improve its performance et 0 hsmod is mathematically expressed as eq 3 3 et 0 hsmod m t m n t x t n r a where m and n are the calibration coefficients from hargreaves and samani 1985 which need to be adjusted for site specific conditions of the different stations using fao56 pm as a reference instead of using the general values of 0 0023 and 17 8 respectively although other methods such as the one proposed by shiri et al 2015 could be useful to locally calibrate the coefficients of hs the conventional procedure is adequate in cases where enough years are available on the dataset on the other way fao56 pmt is the application of fao56 pm using only temperature data and approximations to relative humidity rh and solar radiation by using air temperature wind speed u 2 is usually set to 2 m s 1 or regional mean values the mean saturation vapor pressure es actual vapor pressure ea and vapor pressure deficit vpd are estimated with eqs 4 5 and 6 respectively dew temperature t dew is estimated according to todorovic et al 2013 where different approaches from tn are carried out depending on the aridity table 3 4 e s 0 6108 2 exp 17 27 t x t x 237 3 exp 17 27 t

temperature at 00 30 7 hourmin hourmin sunset hourmin t x hours 8 energy t i 1 48 t i 1 t i 0 5 c h o u r s 2 5 machine learning models all machine learning models were implemented on python using the following libraries keras chollet 2015 scikit learn pedregosa et al 2011 scikit optimize head et al 2020 tensorflow abadi et al 2015 xgboost chen and guestrin 2016 neupy and hpelm akusok et al 2015 all computations were running in a server workstation over anaconda 3 7 with the following features 2x intel xeon cpu e5 2650 v3 2 30 ghz and 128 gb of ram the models ann svm rf xgboost grnn and elm used in this study are detailed below as well as the hyperparameters optimization in section 2 5 7 2 5 1 multilayer perceptron mlp a neural network nn model is a data processing system inspired by the biological nervous system of the human brain it is composed of a large number of interconnected neurons working on the purpose of solving a specific problem in our case for estimating reference evapotranspiration using only temperature parameters as inputs all nn models have three different layers input hidden and output layer the input layer corresponds to the data our system can use to resolve a problem whereas the output represents the results the hidden layer is usually called as a black box because its processes are not controlled and its functionality is modified itself by an auto training method a single hidden layer and a single neuron model is called perceptron fig a1 eq 9 represents the mathematical expression of a general perceptron with different inputs where xi represents the different inputs i of our system wi are the weights that multiply each input to a corresponding neuron b is a bias value f is an activation function and y is the output 9 y f i 1 n w i x i b besides multiple hidden layers with one or more neurons each is called multilayer perceptron mlp and their architecture is represented in the appendix fig a2 the f is responsible for whether a neuron should be activated or not the activation functions used in this work have been sigmoid tanh and relu fig a3 the most important part of mlp is the learning process which is called back propagation where the results given by the model are introduced in a cost function and the weights are updated every epoch to minimize it this updating process can be carried out by several optimizers in this study the optimizers sgd stochastic gradient descent rmsprop root mean square prop and adam adaptive moment estimation have been used the sgd optimizer is the most used due to its simplicity and good results rmsprop optimizer is like gradient descent with momentum the difference lays on how the gradients are calculated eventually the adam is a combination of rmsprop and sgd descent with momentum using the squared gradients to scale the learning rate like rmsprop and taking the momentum by using moving average of the gradient for more detailed information about these optimizers hinton et al 2012 kingma and ba 2014 sutskever et al 2013 can be consulted finally the hyperparameters introduced into optimization are the number of neurons of the first hidden layer from 1 to 20 neurons the number of neurons of the other hidden layers from 1 to 20 the number of hidden layers from 1 to 4 the activation sigmoid tanh and relu the optimizer function sgd rmsprop and adam and the number of epochs from 1 to 100 2 5 2 extreme leaning machine elm despite the good results given by mlp in reference evapotranspiration the high computational cost of the learning process made scientists study new approaches huang et al 2006 proposed a single hidden layer feedforward neural network slfnns where the weights and biases of the hidden layer are randomly generated and not tuned and the output weights and bias are analytically calculated as a result the model obtained has a very low computational cost because no iteration learning process is required even if the number of neurons is less than the number of inputs the hidden node parameters of elm should not be tuned throughout training being able to learn distinct samples with good results abdullah et al 2015 feng et al 2017b fogocic et al 2016 the hyperparameters introduced into optimization are the number of neurons of the hidden layer from 1 to 1000 and its activation function 2 5 3 generalized regression neural network grnn generalized regression neural networks grnn was first proposed by specht 1991 as a modification of a radial basis function network rbfn grnn models are based on nonlinear regression estimation functions and its structure is composed of four layers the input layer the pattern layer the summation layer and the output layer fig 4 each neuron of the pattern layer represents a training input pattern and its output is a measure of the distance of the input from the stored patterns the summation layer is composed of two different kinds of nodes the s nodes and the d node represented by s and d in fig 4 the number of s nodes is the same as the number of outputs and it computes the sum of the weighted outputs of the pattern layer each node is connected to its correspondent output on the contrary the d node is connected to all outputs and it calculates the unweighted outputs of the pattern layer the calculation of each output is the division between the output of each s node by the d node output yielding the estimated value fig 4 the mathematical expression of the output is represented in eqs 10 and 11 10 y i i 1 n w i exp g x x i i 1 n exp g x x i 11 g x x i j 1 m x x j σ 2 where y i is the predicted value to an unknown input vector x xi is the input training vector w i is the weight connection between the ith neuron n and m are the numbers of training patterns and the number of elements of an input vector respectively g is the gaussian function and σ is a hyperparameter that modifies the width of the gaussian function firat and gungor 2009 the special feature of grnns is that it does not require an iterate training procedure because the local minima problem was not faced during development specht 1991 making this model the fastest and with a low error performance feng et al 2017a 2017b kisi and kilic 2016 this algorithm is designed by neupy python library where the only hyperparameter to modify is σ with a range of 0 0001 5 0 2 5 4 support vector machine svm support vector machine is a machine learning technique that covers classification svm and regression svr alike the main idea of svm which is extrapolated to svr is to linearly separate two or more classes with a hyperplane where the margins are maximized in fig 5 there is a graphical summary of support vectors for classification a and regression b the optimization problem is mathematically expressed as eq 12 or by lagrange function as eqs 13 and 14 12 min 1 2 w 2 s t y i x i w b 1 0 i 13 l w b α 1 2 w 2 i 1 m α i y i x i w b 1 14 m i n w m a x b α l w b α s t α i 0 i 1 m where w is the weight vector x i is the input vector b is the bias y i is the actual class value of the input and α is the lagrange multiplier an important aspect is the use of kernel functions to enable support vectors to operate in a high dimensional feature x space the definition is given a mapping function x v we call the function k x r defined by k x x x x v where v denotes an inner product in v a kernel function vapnik 2000 the different kernels we can find in scikit learn are linear kernel k x x x x polynomial kernel k x x x x c d sigmoid kernel k x x tanh x x c and rbf or gaussian kernel k x x exp γ x x 2 fig 6 shows an example for each kernel for further svr explanations see smola and schölkopf 2004 the hyperparameter used in optimization is the kernel function polynomial sigmoid and rbf c from 0 0001 to 1000 and ε from 0 0001 to 1000 the parameters c and ε correspond to the regularization parameter and the margin within no penalty is associated respectively 2 5 5 random forest rf random forest network is an ensemble tree based method proposed by breiman 2001 where trees are trained in a random subset and it can be used with bagging or pasting although is more common to use the first technique it also introduces extra randomness when the number of trees starts growing instead of searching the best feature to split a node it searches the best feature among a random subset of features resulting in greater tree diversity for further information feng et al 2017a can be consulted the hyperparameters tested in this work are the number of trees in the forest from 1 to 1000 the splitting criteria the mean square error o mean absolute error the maximum number of features considered to split a node of a tree one third one half three fourth the square root and the logarithm in base two of the number of features and the use of bagging or pasting the rest of the parameters are in default mode 2 5 6 xgboost it is a new machine learning model proposed by chen et al 2015 based on gradient boosting machines gbm and the classification and regression trees cart where a subset of weak learners are combined developing new stronger learners through the introduction of training strategies the main idea of boosting methods is to train models sequentially where each model try to reduce the error of the predecessor the objective of xgboost is reducing the computational cost while preventing overfitting thanks to the capacity of executing parallel calculations the hyperparameters introduced in the optimization process are the number of trees in the forest from 1 to 1000 the learning rate from 0 0001 to 1 the maximum depth of a tree from 1 to 30 the subsample ratio of the training instances setting it to 0 5 means that xgboost would randomly sample half of the training data before growing trees and this will prevent overfitting from 0 01 to 0 999 the subsample ratio of columns when constructing each tree 1 3 1 2 3 4 and 1 and the objective function regression with squared loss and regression with squared log loss 2 5 7 bayesian hyperparameter optimization the aim of hyperparameter optimization inside machine learning consists of finding a hyperparameter set for a given machine learning model that returns the most accurate performance on the validation dataset and likely it will outperform in the testing dataset for example for a typical multilayer perceptron mlp model it is very common to search for the number of hidden layers the number of neurons in those layers the learning rate or the optimizer function among others hyperparameter optimization is mathematically represented as follows eq 15 15 x arg min f x x x where f x represents the objective function we want to minimize for example the mean absolute error between predicted values and measured values x is the optimized set of hyperparameters and x represents the whole hyperparameter space the first approach is to manually change parameters based on experience and previous results until a good set is found known as manual tuning sometimes it could yield good results although not the best but in many other cases it could lead to a local minimum which could be far from the global as a second solution automatic methods such as grid or random search could be used having slightly better results than manual tuning because all this process is automatically carried out in a loop however they are completely blind to past evaluations and as a result they often spend a significant amount of time evaluating bad parameters bayesian optimization emerged as an efficient solution to these problems močkus 1975 it is an algorithm that uses the bayes theorem to search the minimum of an objective function the followed procedure is 1 a defined number of points from the hyperparameter space are tested 2 the algorithm considers past evaluations when selecting the next hyperparameters to evaluate acquisition function enabling itself to focus on those areas of the parameter space that are believed to bring promising validation scores 3 this new hyperparameter set is evaluated and 4 if the optimization has not finished it goes to the second point roughly in terms of machine learning it could be defined as the automatic method of manual tuning due to its similarity to human behavior while tuning borji and itti 2013 shahriari et al 2016 three major choices must be made to select a prior over functions that will express assumptions about the function being optimized in our case the gaussian process gp prior due to its flexibility the acquisition function determining the posterior model and allowing us to determine the next point to evaluate snoek et al 2012 in fig 7 it can be seen as an example of the bayesian optimization process for gp finally it is necessary to select which hyperparameters are used and their limits in this aspect several ranges of hyperparameters were chosen by trial and error snoek et al 2012 it is important to realize that the bigger the limits the bigger the number of epochs the algorithm needs to get the most accurate set of parameters and the longer the computational cost this is the reason why choosing a sensible range is very important to the efficiency of the optimization besides this methodology should be carried out using the training dataset whereas the final neural network architecture will be assessed by the testing dataset these data cannot influence the training or tuning processes which is in line with works like feng et al 2017a 2017b ferreira et al 2019 and ferreira and da cunha 2020 however using the testing dataset to tune the fittest architecture and a hyperparameter set is not recommended because it conducts the results to a bias on testing data which alienates from the main goal of generalization the specific limits and hyperparameters were previously defined for each model whereas the number of epochs for the optimization was set to 500 being 50 epochs randomly selected for further information about bayesian optimization and gaussian processes see shahriari et al 2016 2 6 data standardization standardization of input datasets is a common requirement among all neural network models in exception of tree based models and it can be expressed as eq 16 16 x stand x x σ where x stand is the data standardized x is the input data x is the mean of the training input dataset and σ is the standard deviation of the training input dataset 2 7 statistical analysis the model performances were evaluated by using the following parameters root mean square error rmse mean bias error mbe the coefficient of determination r 2 and the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nse the rmse mbe r2 and nse are defined as eqs 17 18 19 and 20 17 rmse 1 n i 1 n x i y i 2 18 mbe 1 n i 1 n x i y i 19 r 2 i 1 n x i x y i y 2 i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 20 nse 1 i 1 n x i y i 2 i 1 n x i x 2 where n is the number of records the bar denotes the mean and y and x are the predicted and fao56 pm et 0 values respectively 3 results and discussion in order to avoid not promising configurations a previous evaluation was carried out in the weather station of córdoba with different combinations of tx tn ra energy t e s e a vpd t dew and hourmin where 11 configurations from 3 to 6 inputs were chosen tx tn ra were always selected in all the configurations due to its high efficiency the rest of the combinations were excluded because no significant improvements were shown finally these selected 11 input configurations table 5 were assessed at each location and for all models 3 1 performance of models in the different locations in terms of the statistics mbe rmse r2 and nse their minimum mean and maximum values are summarized in table 6 for all the configurations of the different studied models at each station in córdoba aridity index 0 4616 in terms of rmse the mean values of all ml models 0 5249 mm day improved the performance of hsmod 0 6071 mm day and hs 0 6460 mm day the best rmse performance 0 4983 mm day was carried out by svm whereas the worst among ml models was carried out by grnn 0 5691 mm day so close to xgboost 0 5620 mm day on average the model with the best performance was svm having the mean rmse value of 0 5068 mm day very close to elm 0 5145 mm day regarding nse its behavior was like rmse where all ml performances the worst value was 0 9427 obtained by grnn outperformed hsmod 0 9348 the most precise model was again svm 0 9561 followed by mlp 0 9557 and elm 0 9545 the ranking on mean values is almost identical where svm maintain the first place but mlp and elm switch their positions with the values 0 9546 0 9532 and 0 9510 respectively the minimum mbe value 0 0006 mm day of all the assessed models was obtained with mlp it also got the worst value among ml models 0 1931 mm day although on average the best performance was carried out by svm with a mean of 0 0073 mm day the r2 values were very satisfactory for all models ranging from 0 9434 grnn to 0 9565 mlp even in hs 0 9366 and hsmod 0 9358 in málaga aridity index 0 3666 in terms of nse the efficiency performance obtained by all the studied models outperformed hs 0 8791 and hsmod 0 8824 their values ranged from 0 8916 xgboost to 0 9091 mlp and the mean among all ml models was 0 8995 mlp elm and svm overpassed the 0 9 performance in mean whereas all models except for xgboost exceeded it with their best configuration besides regarding rmse the values were also better than those obtained by hargreaves methods being the best mean values obtained by elm 0 6173 mm day mlp 0 6189 mm day and svm 0 6243 mm day in this order mlp outperformed the rest of the models with the best rmse value 0 5952 mm day on the other hand xgboost got the worst performance with a rmse value of 0 6512 mm day which keeps being better than those obtained by hs 0 6876 mm day or hsmod 0 6781 mm day regarding r2 the results of ml models outperformed hs and hsmod however the mbe values were worse on average with exception of elm grnn and rf the best value was obtained in both cases by mlp mbe 0 0732 mm day and r2 0 9105 in tabernas which is the station with the lowest aridity index 0 178 the rmse ranged from 0 6210 mm day elm to 0 7109 mm day mlp this last model and configuration was the only one that did not outperform hsmod rmse 0 7011 mm from all the models assessed elm was the one with the smallest minimum mean and maximum rmse values 0 6210 0 6532 and 0 6722 mm day respectively concerning nse its values ranged from 0 8767 mlp to 0 9059 elm being 0 8767 the unique value that did not outperform hsmod 0 8800 on average the model performance raking in both nse and rmse is elm mlp rf grnn xgboost and svm in this order in addition the mbe value reached its minimum 0 0015 mm day with mlp and configuration 9 and on average the value obtained using hsmod 0 0728 mm was outperformed by all the models except for svm and xgboost finally the r2 obtained a very similar behavior to nse but in this case all ml models outperformed hs and hsmod in conil aridity index 0 4790 the best models regarding rmse and nse were mlp rmse 0 5853 mm day and nse 0 8967 rf rmse 0 5859 mm day and nse 0 8965 and grnn rmse 0 5884 mm day and nse 0 8956 in contrast the worst model performances were elm rmse 0 6721 mm day and nse 0 8637 mlp rmse 0 6619 mm day and nse 0 8679 and xgboost rmse 0 6581 mm day and nse 0 8694 in this coastal location moreover the ml models obtained the most significant improvements against hsmod and hs over the other stations the r2 behavior was in line with nse but the mbe of ml models did not outperform hs 0 0683 mm day which was one of the best apart from mlp 0 0048 mm day a main feature of mbe is that all results were negative which means that all models overestimated et0 finally in aroche which is the most humid location aridity index 0 555 the values of r2 and nse using hsmod and all evaluated models were very satisfactory being both statistics higher than 0 9 for all the cases according to rmse the best results were obtained by mlp 0 4592 mm day followed by elm 0 4800 mm day however on average svm had the highest accurate estimations 0 5134 mm day followed very close to xgboost and elm 0 5168 and 0 5179 mm day respectively being all of them lower than the obtained by hsmod on the other hand mbe denotes underestimations in all cases ranging from 0 1789 mm day with mlp to 0 4185 mm day using mlp comparing the performance of the different models in the different stations it could be stated that there was a high performance variability between models in the different stations mlp was usually one of the best models in most of the statistics however it usually also had one of the worst values there is a higher dependence on the chosen configuration which could lead to overfitting in some cases the elm and svm usually obtained very close or even better values than mlp apart from having a less scattered performance variance on the other hand rf and xgboost tree based models were in general the worst models in the different statistics the grnn and elm are the models with less computational requirements because they do not need any training process it could be stated that elm is the most adequate model to estimate et0 in these weather stations comparing results from different stations with very close mean annual et0 values table 2 córdoba and tabernas inland locations had very accurate mbe results while the coastal stations denoted an overestimation tendency in all models and configurations the rmse values obtained in málaga tabernas and conil stations were quite similar on average although tabernas had slightly worse values in all the different models on the other hand córdoba and aroche had the best results in terms of r2 and nse the results were in line with rmse córdoba and aroche had the best estimations with values around 0 95 in both locations but the rest of the stations were closer to 0 9 which keep being considered as a good performance 3 2 performance of the configurations in order to evaluate the results obtained between different configurations in each station and without any dependence on ml models the mean of the statistical indices rmse mbe r2 and nse of the different models using a specific configuration are shown in fig 8 in general the input configuration tx tn and ra configuration 1 performed rmse as the worst value in all the stations on the other hand the statistics mbe r2 and nse went along with this line in inland locations córdoba tabernas and aroche whereas in coastal stations málaga and conil not such bad performances were obtained using this configuration in some cases very satisfactory values were obtained in coastal locations such as mbe in conil and málaga and r2 and nse in conil the introduction of the energyt parameter in the inputs configurations 2 8 and 11 improved the performances in all the stations except for mbe in conil in málaga the lowest rmse and the highest nse values were obtained using configurations 11 followed by 2 and 8 moreover in conil the results obtained using configurations 2 7 and 6 were the best in terms of rmse and nse córdoba and aroche had on average the best r2 performance and the lowest variability using most configurations which is in contrast to the rest of the stations however the nse values obtained in córdoba surpassed the values obtained in aroche for all configurations on the other hand aroche had the highest mbe values which is the indication of a dominant underestimation tendency for all the configurations assessed in table 7 it is shown the best nse and rmse mm day values for all the stations in the different configurations in córdoba the best nse and rmse values were obtained using configuration 11 nse 0 9560 and rmse 0 4982 mm day and very close to configurations 8 nse 0 9553 and rmse 0 5026 mm day 3 nse 0 9551 and rmse 0 5038 mm day and 9 nse 0 9548 and rmse 0 5053 mm day in this order the only configuration that did not outperform configuration 1 using elm in terms of nse was configuration 10 using elm in málaga the two best results were given using configurations 5 rmse 0 6070 mm day 7 0 6084 mm day and 10 rmse 0 6089 mm day having very close values one another these configurations also obtained the best nse performances 0 9057 0 9053 and 0 9052 respectively on the contrary configurations 2 3 4 8 9 and 11 worsen configuration 1 in both nse and rmse in tabernas the configurations with energyt as inputs 2 8 and 11 gave the best statistics rmse 0 6272 mm day and nse 0 9034 rmse 0 6209 mm day and nse 0 9058 rmse 0 6267 mm day and nse 0 9012 respectively the worst values were obtained by the configuration 10 rmse 0 6610 mm day and nse 0 8933 and 1 rmse 0 6607 mm day and nse 0 8934 in conil the best configuration performances were 3 7 8 2 and 10 in this order the use of hourmin made the model obtain the most efficient estimation in this location and the use of energyt also outperformed configuration 1 finally in aroche all the configuration outperformed configuration 1 except for configuration 5 and 10 configurations 4 6 8 11 and 2 obtained the best rmse and nse values this station had the highest improvements in rmse from hs and hsmod while in conil it is obtained the highest nse outperforming in general it could be sum up that the use of temperature based variables outperformed configuration 1 the use of energyt is highly recommended due to its efficiency improvements on the other hand the use of hourmin did not have considerable gains in most of the assessed stations although the results in the less arid stations córdoba conil and aroche where the aridity index is above 0 45 outperform from the use of tx tn and ra this value varies more in these stations due to a more frequent raining events 3 3 seasonal performance behavior regarding the performance of the models in different seasons fig 9 shows the statistical values of rmse mbe r2 and nse a b c and d respectively in terms of r2 winter had the worst results for all the studied models not only on average but also as the highest interquartile range whereas in autumn the highest precision was obtained regarding a ranking of general good performance the best results were obtained in autumn followed by spring and summer for both r2 and nse values on the other side the lowest r2 value 0 0976 resulted in málaga with elm and using configuration 8 also corresponding with the value nse 1 0066 rmse 0 9246 and mbe 0 1749 moreover mbe did not have any significant variability in the mean values due to seasons but the interquartile range was more compact in summer for all the models except for mlp and some outliers in aroche finally concerning rmse values the best performance was obtained using the mlp model in winter followed by the same approach in autumn regarding all the models and sites studied in spring and summer rmse values were lower than 0 9 mm in table 8 it is shown the different mean nse and rmse values along all models and stations to seasonally assess the performance of the different input configurations generally as it was stated in fig 9 the nse had better values in autumn whereas in winter the performance down to the worst in winter the best configurations were configuration 6 nse 0 4142 3 nse 0 4130 and 9 nse 0 4133 respectively in spring the best configurations were 2 nse 0 7603 8 nse 0 7572 and 11 nse 0 7538 in summer the results are very similar to spring where the best configurations are 2 nse 0 5675 3 nse 0 5658 8 nse 0 5600 and 11 nse 0 5550 finally in autumn there is no significant outperforming among the configurations is also the most accurate season in all cases the use of configurations with energyt and hourmin obtained significantly outperforms in winter spring and summer among all stations and models so the use of these variables is highly recommended to outperform temperature based models it is of interest that hourmin obtained significantly gains in winter where the rains are more frequent in these stations 3 4 overall discussion in general the results obtained by applying the proposed models outperformed the hargreaves methods and gave slightly better values of nse and r2 nse 0 82 and r2 0 83 for the local scenario and daily inputs and nse 0 89 and r2 0 90 for the local scenario and hourly inputs than those reported by ferreira and da cunha 2020 for ten weather stations in brazil 3 93 mm day of mean et0 although slightly worse in terms of mean rmse values rmse 0 53 for the local scenario and daily inputs and rmse 0 41 for the local scenario and hourly inputs however the rmse values obtained for most models were better than the results for temperature based models assessed by fan et al 2018 in several locations in china the et0 in the studied stations was ranging from 2 5 to 3 4 mm day in the different stations with a mean rmse performance of 0 7069 mm day with the temperature based models what is more the nse performance in all the stations with different climate condition semi arid arid sub humid and humid of india by adamala 2018 using wavelet neural networks wnn are lower than the mean nse values obtained in the assessed stations of andalusia the results of traore et al 2010 in the sudano sahelian zone gave similar mean r2 values in the temperature based models although the rmse values were lower in this zone besides the results of rf and gep obtained by karimi et al 2020 and shiri 2017 in iran using temperature based models were worst in terms of maximum and mean nse values than those obtained in these 5 stations of andalusia finally in terms of rmse and comparing the results with other studies carried out in spain the values were lower than those of landeras et al 2008 with mlp in the basque country northern spain and worse than the results of martí et al 2015 b with calibrated hs in eastern spain in general the computation cost of elm and grnn models were lower than using mlp xgboost and rf being the elm approach one of the best mean performance in all the stations assessed on the other hand rf and xgboost despite needing the most computational requirements and being slower on average it is not reflected that higher computational effort on training in the final results the good results obtained when using energyt as an input variable in any of the configurations 2 8 and 11 demonstrates that the information contained on it gives a detailed characterization of the thermic behavior at each location resulting in more efficient models than using only daily maximum and minimum temperature its use in inland stations showed one of the best performances while its use on coastal stations was not such substantial may be due to the effect of sea the temperature variability during a day is less affected by meteorological events on the other hand hourmin was also assessed with no such significant outperforming as energyt had but improving the modeling from the use of only tx tn and ra in the less arid stations aridity index above 0 45 of córdoba conil and aroche see table 1 another arising feature in this work is that the use of temperature based approximations of ea es vpd and tdew had improvements over the models using only configuration 1 although it is usually considered to be learned by the ml model in the training process the introduction of these parameters as input variables may help the model learn minimizing the possibility of overfitting occurrence therefore configurations using the new parameters energyt and hourmin can be used in this kind of models to estimate et0 more accurately being elm model the one that obtained in general the highest performances this is crucial in stations where the data acquisition is limited like developing countries or low cost weather stations that cannot collect the rest of the meteorological variables required by fao56 pm 4 conclusions different models using several meteorological temperature based parameters as input variables have been developed and assessed at five locations in the andalusia region southern spain covering different climatic conditions the main novelty of this work is the use of new meteorological parameters based on intra daily temperature variables energyt and hourmin the evaluation of different configurations the combination of other climatological parameters such as vpd ea es and tdew as inputs in the different approaches studied as well as the use of bayesian optimization to tune hyperparameters for each of them the results indicated that the use of the novel s temperature based parameters in these neural network approaches outperformed in general the estimations of et0 in all the assessed stations comparing to hargreaves methods and models using tx tn and ra in terms of rmse and r2 the values were reduced from 0 8264 mm day hsmod to 0 5853 mm day mlp and from 0 8182 hsmod to 0 9039 mlp respectively the improvement in the nse values was slightly better than in r2 increasing from 0 7939 hsmod to 0 8967 mlp finally the best improvement was obtained in the mbe statistic gaining from 0 2830 mm day hsmod to 0 0048 mm day mlp as a rule there is not a model that firmly outperforms the rest of the models in terms of mean statistics although mlp was usually the model that gave the best performance in most locations although its variability was high besides grnn and elm were the models with the lowest computational cost where elm performed with one of the best nse and rmse in most stations and configurations additionally based on the results obtained in this work it can be observed an improvement of the statistical performance by using energyt in any of the configurations assessed while using hourmin had improvements in the most humid stations where the aridity index is above 0 45 additionally in terms of seasonal performances the statistics obtained significantly outperforms in winter spring and summer among all stations and models therefore the elm model with energyt and hourmin can be used to improve limited climatic models to increase the accuracy of et0 estimations further studies can deeply explore these parameters and models for regional scenarios and in locations with different climatic conditions from those studied in this work due to the rise of low cost sensorization especially for variables such as air temperature and the possibility of collecting these records with a higher sampling frequency than the conventional daily scale the approaches proposed in this work may result in greater efficiency in the use of water resources funding this work was supported by the university of córdoba and the

10266,the ridge furrow mulching system rfms is widely used to improve crop yields and water use efficiency in arid and semi arid rainfed agricultural regions however the effects of rfms on hydrothermal states and maize zea mays l yields in dry sub humid regions remain unclear the objective of this study was to determine the influence of ridge furrow construction and plastic film mulching on soil moisture and temperature evapotranspiration et maize growth and yield water use efficiency wue and thermal time use efficiency tue in dry sub humid regions of the loess plateau a three year field study was conducted in which four different planting practices were evaluated 1 alternating wide ridges and narrow furrows with film mulching wrm 2 alternating equal width ridges and furrows with film mulching erm 3 equal row spacing in flat plot with half film mulching efm and 4 conventional flat plot without mulching ck the results demonstrated that at early maize growth stages soil water storage within the 0 200 cm soil profile and soil temperatures were increased for mulching treatments compared with ck rfms utilized soil water efficiently by increasing rainwater harvesting efficiency and transpiration while decreasing soil evaporation rfms significantly increased soil temperature in the ridges by 4 0 4 4 c and reduced diurnal soil temperature amplitude in the furrows thereby increasing soil thermal time these positive effects of rfms compared with ck improved maize growth and crop yields because of adequate absorption and utilization of water and thermal resources rfms increased average maize yield by 24 9 32 8 wue by 34 1 45 7 and tue by 15 9 21 1 the highest grain yield wue and tue were observed with wrm due to its favorable soil hydrothermal conditions the wrm treatment is a promising water saving and high yielding maize cultivation practice to improve grain yields and resource use efficiency in dry sub humid regions keywords plastic film mulching ridge furrow soil hydrothermal maize yield water use efficiency dry sub humid regions 1 introduction water scarcity is a major global problem limiting crop growth and grain yields and has become more serious with increasing population in some arid semi arid and semi humid areas of the world li et al 2015 piao et al 2010 pinheiro and chaves 2011 in addition global climate change has influenced the quantity and distribution of rainfall in the past 50 years which has reduced crop water use and increased drought stress zhang et al 2014 the loess plateau is a main grain production area in northwest china and yields have been negatively impacted by water scarcity in the past 30 years li et al 2009 cold temperature stress caused by the high altitude of this area could also be considered as an adverse factor inhibiting seed germination and root activity thus reducing agricultural productivity bu et al 2013 even though the sub humid areas of the loess plateau have more precipitation than the semi arid areas drought stress occurs frequently during the crop growing season li et al 2017a crops in this area depend primarily on precipitation and most of the rainfall occurs between june and september owing to the continental monsoon climate uneven distribution of sometimes limited precipitation together with incongruous temperatures significantly restrict crop growth and agricultural productivity deng et al 2006 therefore it is extremely urgent to implement some effective crop management measures to obtain higher precipitation collection efficiency grain yields and water use efficiency mulching techniques have been widely adopted by farmers to improve food security in northwest china these techniques have included the use of plastic film mulch gravel mulch straw mulch and ridge furrow harvesting technology in the past 30 years bhardwaj 2013 plastic film mulching has been a useful water saving method in dryland areas especially for maize zea mays l which is widely grown in northwest china fisher 1995 liu et al 2009 plastic film mulching can provide favorable soil moisture and temperature conditions reduce non productive soil water evaporation and improve rainwater conservation thus increasing crop yields dong et al 2009 li et al 2013 accordingly this technology has the ability to increase crop canopy growth grain productivity water use efficiency and precipitation use efficiency bu et al 2013 however microclimate conditions in micro fields have been reported as being different under different types of plastic film mulches and planting patterns zhao et al 2014 in situ rainwater harvesting technology has been considered as an important measure to relieve drought stress in some semi arid areas of world hu et al 2014 mo et al 2018b the technology can change field micro topography improve runoff efficiency and increase soil water and temperature the ridge furrow harvesting technology combined with plastic film mulching has shown multiple effects in agriculture and this production practice has evolved and been widely adopted in some semi arid regions in china and africa gan et al 2013 hu et al 2014 mo et al 2016 in this rainwater harvesting system ridges covered with plastic film act as water collecting areas and the bare furrows receive water for plant growth gan et al 2013 li et al 2016 the ridge furrow mulching system rfms can significantly increase precipitation use efficiency reduce soil water evaporation and increase soil water content by concentrating light rains to increase infiltration to deeper soil layers wang et al 2008 rfms can help regulate the soil hydrothermal environment accelerate crop canopy growth and thereby increase crop productivity wue and economic benefits bu et al 2013 hou et al 2015 moreover the sizes of ridges and furrows in this system can affect soil water content soil temperature grain yield and wue wang et al 2015a zhao et al 2014 determining appropriate ridge and furrow widths is essential for developing more efficient rfms that will result in better soil hydrothermal conditions and increase crop yields wang et al 2015a 2015b previous research studies investigating different ridge furrow ratios have reported results for wheat triticum aestivum l maize alfalfa medicago sativa l oat avena sativa l and potato solanum tuberosom l li and gong 2002 ren et al 2016 wang et al 2008 2015a 2015b for instance li and gong 2002 found 120 cm ridges and 60 cm furrows produced the highest maize production li et al 2007 reported that soil water was greater for ridges with 60 cm width than for ridges with 45 cm and 30 cm widths these studies indicated that increasing mulched ridge width positively affected soil hydrothermal conditions resulted in increased crop yields and wue additionally wide ridges can reflect more light to the crops planted in the furrows thus increasing leaf photosynthesis and aboveground dry matter gan et al 2013 however crop yields cannot be increased without limit when increasing the mulched ridge width while maintaining the same planting density because of excessive plant competition in the furrows wang et al 2009 moreover wider ridges require increased labor costs and plastic film material costs which will decrease net economic benefit the use of plastic film can also cause negative effects on the soil environment and can lead to reduced crop production briassoulis 2006 hu et al 2019 meteorological conditions in the dry sub humid areas of the loess plateau have some similar characteristics to those found in the semi arid areas in that both areas usually suffer from some yield reducing drought stress during the crop growing season li et al 2016 additionally optimal ridge and furrow widths are affected by distinct environmental elements including climate characteristics rainfall soil class and crop species gan et al 2013 li et al 2008 although some work that has recently been conducted in sub humid areas indicated that rfms could be implemented in this area the mechanisms regarding the transfer and distribution of soil hydrothermal conditions that affect crop yields remain unclear additionally many previous studies have rarely investigated the combined effects of soil water and temperature for maize production in this area gaining a better understanding of the mechanisms would lead to optimized rfms design and improve crop water use modeling and thereby increase crop yields and resource use efficiency therefore a three year field study was carried out in the guanzhong plain region of the loess plateau which is characterized by a dry sub humid climate li et al 2016 the objectives of this study were to 1 compare the influences of different ridge furrow and film mulching patterns on maize growth water use thermal time use efficiency and crop productivity 2 investigate the mechanisms regulating hydrothermal states of different ridge and furrow widths under rfms and 3 identify promising mulching planting patterns in order to offer a theoretical basis for optimized dryland maize production in dry sub humid regions 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of experimental site the field experiment was carried out during the 2014 2016 maize growing seasons at the institute of water saving agriculture in arid areas of china of northwest agricultural and forestry university in yangling shaanxi province china 34 20 n 108 24 e 521ma s l the experimental site was located in a dryland area on the southern loess plateau of northwest china the mean annual evaporation is 1440 mm and mean annual precipitation is approximately 635 mm with an uneven distribution of precipitation due to the sub humid monsoon climate i e more than half of the total annual precipitation occurs during the summer between june and september the mean annual temperature is 13 c and the mean difference between day and night temperatures is 11 5 c the mean annual sunshine duration is 2196 h and the continuous frost free period is 169 200 days an automated weather observation station at the experimental site recorded the daily maximum and minimum air temperatures and precipitation during the three maize growing seasons fig 1 the total precipitation amounts for the three maize growing seasons were 379 5 mm 2014 283 9 mm 2015 and 264 1 mm 2016 the first year was a relatively wet year and the next two years were normal precipitation years the daily mean temperatures during the three maize growing seasons were 23 0 c 23 4 c and 26 1 c respectively the groundwater at the experimental site was below 50 m and therefore we ignored upward movement of soil water into the root zone basic soil properties in the 0 100 cm soil layer are listed in table 1 2 2 experimental design and field management the study was arranged in a randomized complete block design that consisted of three replications of four experimental treatments the four different planting patterns used during the study were as follows 1 wrm alternating wide ridges and narrow furrows with film mulching fig 2a 2 erm alternating equal width ridges and furrows with film mulching fig 2b 3 efm equal row spacing in flat plot with half film mulching fig 2c 4 ck conventional flat plot without mulching fig 2d the area of each experimental plot was 18 m2 4 m wide 4 5 m long and was bordered by high wide ridges to avoid runoff for the rfms treatments the ridges 60 or 80 cm width and 15 cm height were covered with 0 008 mm thick transparent and impermeable plastic film and served as rainwater collecting zones soil was placed on the edges of the plastic film to securely anchor it non mulched furrows 40 or 60 cm width served as rainwater receiving areas for the efm treatment the flat surface was covered with 0 008 mm thick transparent and impermeable plastic film in every other inter row space maize cv qinlong 11 was planted at the same planting density of 51 332 plants ha 1 in all four treatments fertilizers were applied to each plot at rates of 225 kg n ha 1 90 kg p2o5 ha 1 and 150 kg k2o ha 1 before planting the chemical fertilizers were spread on the soil surface and tilled into the topsoil no irrigation was applied during the three experimental years pesticides were applied regularly according to local agricultural management practices to maintain normal plant growth the summer maize planting and harvesting dates for the three growing seasons are shown in table 2 2 3 sampling measurements and data analysis 2 3 1 soil moisture in order to obtain the dynamic changes of soil water soil volumetric water content in the 0 200 cm soil profile was observed with a time domain reflectometry probe system trime pico iph germany soil water measurements were at 10 cm increments when the soil depth was 0 100 cm and at 20 cm increments when the soil depth was 100 200 cm the probe access tubes for the soil water measurements were installed in the middle between two maize rows fig 2 soil volumetric water content was measured once a week throughout the entire growing season and the values were the average of three replications the soil water storage sws mm in the 0 200 cm soil profile was determined as follows 1 s w s i 1 n 10 w i h i where i is the different soil layer n is the number of soil layers wi is the soil volumetric water content and hi cm is the soil layer thickness 2 3 2 soil temperature soil temperatures at depths of 5 10 15 20 and 25 cm were recorded from planting to harvesting by a series of mercury thermometers located in the middle between two maize rows in the rfms treatment plots the thermometers were placed in the middle of the mulched ridges and in the middle of the bare furrows the mean daily soil temperature was the average of the measurements at the two locations during the maize growing season soil temperatures were manually recorded every two hours from 8 00 to18 00 at all five depths once a week the mean daily soil temperature at one soil depth was computed as the average of the six time period readings the soil thermal time tts c d and thermal time use efficiency tue kg ha 1 c d 1 were calculated using the following formulas bu et al 2013 subrahmaniyan et al 2018 2 t t s t s t b 3 t u e y t t s where ts c is the mean daily soil temperature tb c is the base active soil temperature 10 c for maize miedema 1982 and y kg ha 1 is grain yield when ts tb tts 0 c d 2 3 3 leaf area index lai and dry matter accumulation the maize growing season in each of the three years was divided into five different developmental stages seedling jointing flowering grain filling and maturity at each maize growth stage three representative plants were randomly sampled from each plot to calculate the leaf area leaf length leaf maximum 0 75 according to mckee 1964 the lai was calculated according to the following equation 4 l a i l e a f a r e a m 2 p l a n t 1 p l a n t d e n s i t y p l a n t s h a 1 10000 m 2 h a 1 after leaf area measurements were completed the maize samples were chopped into small slices and oven dried initially at 105 c for one hour and subsequently at 75 c until a constant weight was reached to determine aboveground dry matter 2 3 4 evapotranspiration et and crop yield total evapotranspiration et mm in each plot was calculated as 5 e t p i δ w where p mm is total precipitation during the maize growing season i mm is irrigation equal to zero in this experiment and δw mm is the sws change in the 0 200 cm soil profile from maize planting to harvesting as each plot was surrounded by border ridges surface runoff was considered to be zero in addition deep percolation was assumed to be negligible because of the relatively low amounts of precipitation received during the growing season ten maize plants were randomly sampled from the middle portion of each plot at physiological maturity to calculate maize grain yield 2 3 5 water use efficiency wue and precipitation use efficiency pue water use efficiency wue kg ha 1 mm 1 and precipitation use efficiency pue kg ha 1 mm 1 were calculated according to the following formulas 6 w u e y e t 7 p u e y p 1 where y kg ha 1 is grain yield et mm is evapotranspiration during the growing season and p1 mm is the effective precipitation during the growing season 2 4 statistical analysis the anova procedure from spss statistical software ibm inc was used on all experimental data over the three growing seasons statistically significant treatment differences between mean values average of three replications were identified using the least significant differences lsd0 05 test figures were created using sigmaplot 12 5 software 3 results 3 1 soil moisture the soil water storage sws in the 0 200 cm soil profile in the three growing seasons was generally increased under all three of the plastic film mulching treatments compared with the ck treatment especially at the early growth stages fig 3 the sws changes under the different treatments were not the same in all three years and were closely related to differences in rainfall and air temperature fig 1 at the seedling growth stage the sws under wrm was 5 1 6 0 and 3 3 higher compared with ck from 2014 to 2016 respectively the effects on sws were followed by erm and efm treatments at this growth stage however there was an obvious reduction in sws for the erm and efm treatments compared with ck due to increased maize water consumption at later growth stages especially at flowering at maturity no significant differences were observed in sws among all the treatments the higher values of sws with the wrm treatment compared with the erm treatment during the maize growing season indicated the better water collection and storage capacity of wrm treatment the swc was influenced by the different mulching treatments and showed spatiotemporal variability fig 4 at the early maize growth stages seedling and jointing plastic film mulching significantly improved swc compared with ck specifically wrm and erm produced higher swc than the other treatments in the 0 60 cm soil layer however during the flowering grain filling stage the swc values under erm and efm were relatively lower than under ck in the 100 140 cm soil layer and the differences were more pronounced for erm at maturity the swc in the deep soil layers was slightly increased under the plastic film mulching treatments when compared with ck and no significant differences in swc were noted at any soil layers among all the treatments 3 2 soil temperature 3 2 1 the dynamics of soil temperature the dynamic changes of daily average soil temperature at the 10 cm soil depth are shown in fig 5 for the three growing seasons the three different mulching treatments produced similar warming effects on soil temperature additionally soil temperatures for the different surface mulching systems were influenced by the specific weather conditions in each study year fig 1 during all three maize growing seasons plastic film mulching significantly increased the daily average soil temperatures over those observed under ck especially in the ridges with mulching for the rfms treatments even though the soil temperature variations over time were similar in the ridges and furrows the warming effect on ridge soil temperatures was significantly greater than observed in the furrows for the rfms treatments daily average soil temperatures in the ridges increased with increasing mulched ridge width especially during early growth stages ridge soil temperatures were 4 2 4 6 and 4 4 c greater with wrm than with ck in the 2014 2015 and 2016 maize growing seasons respectively and 4 0 4 1 and 4 0 c greater with efm than with ck there were no significant differences in soil temperature without mulching among all of the treatments in addition the warming effects caused by film mulching were different in the different growth stages soil temperatures in the ridges with mulching were higher than with ck during the early growth stages but the effects decreased during the later stages at the emergence stage the two rfms treatments significantly increased the 10 cm ridge soil temperatures by 3 8 7 4 c compared with ck however the warming effects on the topsoil produced by the film mulching gradually became less as the maize canopy developed at the reproductive stage the 10 cm ridge soil temperatures with mulching were only 2 8 4 1 c greater than the ck temperatures during the three maize growing seasons 3 2 2 diurnal variation of soil temperature diurnal variations of soil temperature at the seedling and flowering stages during the 2014 and 2015 growing seasons are shown in fig 6 different mulching treatments showed varying effects on the diurnal variation of soil temperature but the patterns were similar at both growth stages plastic film mulching significantly increased soil temperature throughout the day compared with ck and the magnitude of the increase was greater when maize plants were small no significant differences in diurnal variation of soil temperature were detected without film mulching additionally the amplitude of diurnal soil temperature change was greater at the seedling stage than at the flowering stage the amplitude of the diurnal soil temperature change was smaller for the rfms bare furrows than for ck however that was not the case for the ridges with mulching in rfms the smallest diurnal soil temperature amplitude was observed in the bare furrows of the wrm treatment during the seedling stage the amplitudes of the diurnal soil temperature change in the wrm and erm bare furrows were 1 6 c and 1 1 c respectively less than observed in the ck treatment during the two maize growing seasons during the flowering stage the amplitudes of the diurnal soil temperature change in the wrm and erm bare furrows were 0 8 c and 0 6 c respectively less than observed in the ck treatment during the two maize growing seasons there were no obvious differences in the diurnal soil temperature amplitude between efm and ck 3 2 3 dynamics and allocation of soil thermal time tts table 3 shows the dynamics and allocation of tts at different maize growth periods for the 2014 2016 growing seasons the utilization mechanism of the thermal resource with the film mulching treatments was different from the ck treatment compared with ck the different film mulching treatments significantly increased tts throughout the growing season of all three years the wrm erm and efm treatments significantly increased tts by 10 3 14 1 8 6 11 5 5 6 8 0 respectively compared with ck these differences in tts due to film mulching were observed at each of the different maize growth periods the average tts values under wrm erm and efm were increased by 33 4 c d 26 1 c d and 21 4 c d respectively at pt ve by 54 2 c d 42 5 c d and 30 5 c d respectively at ve v6 by 49 3 c d 39 4 c d and 24 3 c d respectively at v6 r1 and by 70 3 c d 62 5 c d and 37 0 c d respectively at r1 r6 in comparison with ck the highest soil thermal time was observed with the wrm treatment maize aboveground dry matter was significantly increased and effectively converted to grain yield because of the greater available thermal resource with the wrm treatment 3 3 leaf area index changes in maize leaf area index lai over the three growing seasons are shown in fig 7 greater lai was observed for all of the plastic film mulching treatments compared with ck over the three study years at about 22 days after planting lai was very small for all treatments and there were no significant treatment differences however at the jointing stage about 38 days after planting maize leaves were growing vigorously and rapidly increasing in size and the lai differences due to plastic film mulching were clearly evident at about 65 days after planting the wrm treatment produced the largest lai values in all three study years at this time lai was 18 3 49 9 14 8 41 2 and 10 1 20 9 greater under wrm erm and efm respectively than under ck subsequently lai began to decline sharply for all treatments as maize plants entered the reproductive growth period at the maturity stage the rfms treatments still exhibited significantly greater lai than the ck treatment and no significant differences were observed between the wrm and the erm treatments 3 4 aboveground dry matter similar to lai significantly greater aboveground dry matter was also observed at most of the maize growth stages for the mulching treatments compared with ck fig 7 aboveground dry matter increased gradually as maize plants developed reaching maximum values at the end of growing season for each of the three study years at the maturity stage aboveground dry matter with the wrm treatment was 65 0 62 2 and 75 1 greater than that with the ck treatment from 2014 to 2016 the respective aboveground dry matter increases for the three study years were 44 9 55 4 and 63 4 with the erm treatment and 26 1 25 2 and 39 8 with the efm treatment compared with ck 3 5 crop yield wue pue and tue plastic film mulching treatments significantly increased maize grain yields during the 2014 2016 growing seasons table 5 with the greatest yields observed for the rfms treatments the mean maize yields for the different mulching treatments followed the pattern of wrm erm efm ck in all three study years compared with ck grain yields with wrm erm and efm were 70 5 48 7 and 46 5 respectively greater than the grain yield with ck in 2014 the respective grain yield increases for the three mulch treatments compared with ck were 13 7 12 1 and 7 8 in 2015 and 32 7 25 7 and 16 0 in 2016 the highest grain yield was produced with wrm which was likely a result of the more favorable soil water and temperature conditions grain yield with the erm treatment was not significantly different from the grain yield observed with the efm treatment the water use and thermal time use were markedly affected by mulching treatments in our study tables 4 and 5 efficient utilization of water and thermal resources under plastic film mulching facilitated the growth of maize and the formation of crop yield especially for the wrm treatment plastic film mulching treatments significantly increased wue pue and tue and decreased et compared with ck in all three experimental years no significant differences were observed in et between mulching treatments and ck in 2014 compared with the ck treatment the wrm treatment increased mean maize wue and pue by 45 7 and 30 5 respectively the respective increases for wue and pue were 34 1 and 23 5 with the erm treatment and 26 0 and 17 3 with the efm treatment the wrm erm and efm treatments increased tue by 21 1 15 9 and 14 8 respectively compared with ck over the 2014 2016 growing seasons no significant differences were observed for tue due to the mulching treatments compared with ck in 2015 this lack of a mulching treatment effect indicated that in this particular year grain yields for all of the treatments increased with increasing thermal units at the same rate 4 discussion 4 1 soil moisture the loss of large amounts of soil water to unproductive uses has been considered as a main factor contributing to land degradation in the loess plateau because of the uneven distribution of precipitation in this region water availability is sometimes not sufficient to sustain normal crop growth and can result in surface runoff bu et al 2013 chen et al 2015 in addition summer crops often suffer from drought at the seedling emergence and establishment stages mulching can significantly enhance soil water availability by reducing soil evaporation losses and increasing soil water storage gan et al 2013 ramakrishna et al 2006 in the current study we found that sws in the 0 200 cm soil profile at the maize seedling stage was significantly increased under the mulching treatments compared with the ck treatment in all three years of the study fig 3 this is likely due to the greater soil water evaporation losses under ck plastic film mulching can significantly reduce soil evaporation caused by the direct influence of solar radiation bu et al 2013 during the early stages of maize development plastic film mulching treatments significantly increased swc in the 0 60 cm soil profile especially under the rfms treatments fig 4 the two rfms treatments had the ability to decrease soil evaporation and improve rainwater harvesting efficiency and thus to increase soil water content li et al 2007 zhang et al 2011 however during the reproductive stages increases in sws under the mulching treatments were not observed and the swc values in the 100 140 cm soil profile with mulching were generally lower than observed for the ck treatment figs 3 and 4 this trend was more pronounced in the efm and erm treatments than in the wrm treatment it supported the point that maize plants under the mulching treatments had greater transpiration and consumed more deep soil water compared with the ck treatment during this period gao et al 2014 mo et al 2016 similar results were also reported by zhang et al 2011 and li et al 2017a they observed that at soil depths below 100 cm the swc under mulching treatments was lower than under the ck treatment at maize maturity sws recovered to a relatively good level due to decreased crop water consumption and soil evaporation as reported by mo et al 2016 the increase in swc under plastic film mulching can act as a sustainable water management practice to help mitigate the negative effects of drought li et al 2017a zhang et al 2019c the optimized redistribution of soil water can increase plant transpiration and photosynthesis rate and thereby increase crop yields compared with unmulched crop production all three mulching treatments in this study significantly increased soil water at early maize stages but the effects were somewhat different for the three treatments our data showed that the rfms treatments could direct rainwater to furrows so that maize planted in the furrows could make full use of rainwater however the runoff efficiency and rainwater collecting efficiency are determined by ridge and furrow sizes in rainfed agricultural areas wang et al 2015a in our study the wrm treatment with wide ridges had the greatest impact on soil water which led to improved rainwater harvesting efficiency and soil water retention capacity li et al 2017b zhang et al 2019a the wider mulched ridges increased the catchment area and reduced soil evaporation which directly affected the movement and distribution of soil water and resulted in greater concentration of rainwater in the maize root zone ren et al 2016 the efm treatment also harvested rainwater but only a small portion of the water reached the root zone because of intensive soil evaporation zhao et al 2009 therefore the wrm treatment should be recognized as a high water saving method because of its ability to optimize collection and use of rainwater which will have the effect of relieving the water scarcity problem in northwest china 4 2 soil temperature and thermal time tts low temperatures have been believed to be the factor accounting for limited seed germination and plant establishment on the loess plateau xiaoli et al 2012 plastic film mulching can decrease the latent and sensible heat exchanges between the soil and the surrounding air which significantly increases the surface soil temperature hu et al 2014 zhou et al 2009 but the warming effects of mulching are varied because of different mulching materials planting practices crop growing season and development stage in the current study plastic film mulching significantly increased the daily mean soil temperatures compared with ck during the 2014 2016 growing seasons especially in the plastic film mulched ridges fig 5 plastic film mulching accelerated seed germination and early plant establishment and changed the growth and development of maize in our study ridge soil temperatures were increased with increasing mulched ridge width suggesting that mulched ridge width is an important factor influencing soil temperatures in rfms zhang et al 2019a there were no significant differences in the bare soil temperatures among all the treatments during the three maize growing seasons the warming effects due to mulching followed the pattern of wrm erm efm ck the wrm treatment with the wide ridges and narrow furrows received greater solar energy at the soil surface resulting in the highest topsoil temperature in the ridges compared to the other treatments li et al 2017b a greater warming effect caused by mulching was observed at the maize emergence stage but the effect decreased with the development of maize similar results were reported by zhou et al 2009 and mo et al 2017 the mechanism for the increased surface soil temperature at early growth stages was that more longwave radiation was collected by the cover material gan et al 2013 mo et al 2017 however the increased warming of topsoil by the presence of mulch gradually decreased with increasing crop canopy development that intercepted most of solar radiation during the later growth periods li et al 2016 liu et al 2009 a primary purpose of plastic film mulching on the loess plateau is to increase topsoil temperatures when air temperatures are low zhang et al 2007 all the mulching treatments in this study significantly improved the diurnal variations of topsoil temperature at the seedling and flowering stages compared with ck fig 6 in addition the diurnal soil temperature amplitude was greater at the seedling stage than at the flowering stage the wrm and erm treatments exhibited smaller diurnal soil temperature amplitude in the furrows than ck over the 2014 and 2015 maize growing seasons fig 6 a similar response was not observed in the ridges with mulching for the rfms treatments zhang et al 2019b reported that the ridge furrow mulching systems decreased the diurnal soil temperature amplitude compared with the ck treatment across two study years especially under the higher mulch coverage ratio treatment which was identical to our results this may be because rfms could alter micro topographic heterogeneity by transforming the distribution of solar radiation and crest characteristics of soil surface and increased rainwater received in the furrows could affect diurnal variations of soil temperature jiang and li 2015 li et al 2019 therefore we arrived at a similar conclusion that the ridge furrow mulching system could decrease the diurnal soil temperature amplitude compared with ck it is well known that the soil thermal resource can significantly affect the growth of different types of crops especially for thermophilic crops such as maize subrahmaniyan et al 2018 in our study wrm erm and efm treatments significantly increased the soil thermal time compared with ck by 175 1 234 6 c d 146 4 173 6 c d and 94 1 133 6 c d respectively during the three growing seasons table 3 as a result greater thermal energy under the film mulching treatments promoted seed germination and plant establishment increased maize growth during the vegetative stage and prolonged the duration of the reproductive stage thereby increasing crop grain yields mo et al 2018a zhou et al 2009 we also found that compared with ck the increase in the thermal resource under film mulching treatments was greater during the r1 r6 growth period than during the other growth periods table 3 this finding indicated that the thermal resource during the reproductive stage was closely related to grain yields during this period large amounts of aboveground biomass could be effectively transferred from vegetative organs to grain yield which helped explain higher grain yields under mulching treatments bu et al 2013 zhang et al 2019b the higher grain yields under mulching were more obvious for the wrm treatment than for the erm and efm treatments with wrm showing the best regulation of crop physiological characteristics due to superior soil thermal conditions liu et al 2010b mo et al 2018a 4 3 maize growth and et maize growth is influenced by the transfer and absorption of different resources during the growing season such as soil water nutrients solar energy and thermal energy mwale et al 2007a 2007b mulching can regulate the relationship between soil water and heat thus changing the crop development process a previous study has shown that favorable hydrothermal conditions resulting from mulching could significantly increase lai and aboveground dry matter ultimately resulting in increased crop yields liu et al 2009 in addition rfms treatments may have promoted the growth of maize roots which would facilitate greater water and nutrient uptake gao et al 2014 liu et al 2009 2010b these resources would then be conveyed to the vegetative organs which would increase crop canopy growth ding et al 2018 in the current study all three mulching treatments significantly increased lai and aboveground biomass compared with ck over the 2014 2016 maize growing seasons especially under the rfms treatments fig 7 the greatest lai and aboveground dry matter were observed with the wrm treatment likely due to this treatment having the best soil water conservation and the highest soil temperatures zhao et al 2014 there were no significant differences in lai and aboveground dry matter between wrm and erm during the 2015 and 2016 maize growing seasons this may be because of similar soil water temperature conditions between the treatments in these two study years evapotranspiration et includes soil evaporation and crop transpiration crop transpiration comprises a large portion of et mo et al 2018b the et differences between the mulching treatments and the ck treatment were influenced by different precipitation patterns li et al 2013 found that plastic film mulching increased water availability by reducing unproductive soil evaporation losses similar to what we found the results of our study showed that the mulching treatments significantly influenced et compared with the ck treatment except in 2014 table 4 this may be because severe drought and high temperatures occurred at the early growth stages and more rainfall occurred at the later growth stages these conditions also led to decreased crop yield in 2014 table 5 as stated earlier plastic film mulching treatments can effectively decrease unproductive soil water evaporation and improve productive plant transpiration zhu et al 2015 ding et al 2018 this shifting of evaporation to transpiration with the plastic film mulch treatments increased maize growth aboveground dry matter and grain yields in all three study years fig 7 and table 5 4 4 crop yield water use efficiency and thermal time use efficiency plastic film mulching can significantly improve soil hydrothermal conditions and photosynthetic rate ensure the supply of crop available water and thus increase aboveground dry matter and crop yield on the loess plateau hou et al 2019 liu et al 2010b the lai aboveground dry matter and crop yield were increased by mulching in our study mean maize grain yields were increased by 32 8 with the wrm treatment by 24 9 with the erm treatment and by 18 9 with the efm treatment compared with ck table 5 the highest maize yield was obtained with the wrm treatment because of its great influence on soil moisture and thermal and light conditions the mechanisms responsible for the increased grain yield with the wrm treatment could be attributed to the following three factors firstly the variability of rainfall frequency and strong soil water evaporation both lead to lower soil water storage and inadequate crop growth mulching the soil surface with plastic film can increase topsoil water content by capillary action and vapor transfer bu et al 2013 moreover the wrm treatment ensured adequate soil water supply by increasing rainwater collection and utilization efficiency ren et al 2008 and decreasing soil water losses and surface runoff during critical growth periods liakatas et al 1986 secondly the wrm treatment produced favorable soil thermal states that avoided the danger of low temperatures and optimized the maize phenology period zhang et al 2017 lastly the wrm treatment can improve crop net photosynthetic rate by making full use of solar radiation thus increasing maize growth and crop yield gan et al 2013 rainfall plays an important role in grain yield formation in rainfed agricultural areas in the world li et al 2001 and many researchers have found that adequate rainfall significantly increases aboveground dry matter and grain yields cakir 2004 liu et al 2009 our results showed that rainfall during the 2014 growing season was more than observed in the 2015 and 2016 growing seasons but the grain yields were less for all of the treatments in 2014 table 5 these results were not in agreement with some previous reports eldoma et al 2016 jia et al 2018 a possible explanation may be that precipitation during the 2014 maize growing season was mainly concentrated in the grain filling and maturity stages which accounted for 68 5 of the precipitation fig 1 little precipitation was observed from maize seedling to flowering stages however a lack of rainfall at early stages of maize development restricted crop normal growth and higher rainfall at later growth stages could not be utilized effectively by plants in contrast rainfall was more evenly distributed in 2015 and 2016 resulting in higher maize yields similar studies have also reported that a large percentage of rainwater is lost by evaporation from the soil surface and that excessive rainfall may reduce maize photosynthesis and cause waterlogging stress in the field li et al 2017a zhang et al 2017 additionally severe drought and high temperatures were observed at the early growth stages of summer maize in our study these factors likely reduced 2014 maize grain yield table 5 the very large increases in grain yields in 2014 seen for the mulching treatments compared with ck could be explained by several reasons firstly the mulching treatments significantly improved soil hydrothermal conditions reduced intense soil evaporation and thus increased maize canopy growth resulting in higher grain yields compared with ck especially for the two rfms treatments although the mulched and unmulched treatments had similar et plastic film mulching could effectively decrease unproductive soil evaporation increase stomatal conductance and increase plant transpiration mo et al 2018b secondly rfms could enhance microbial activity and the rate of n mineralization and nitrification thus increasing fertilizer use efficiency and soil nutrient availability li et al 2017a thirdly mulching treatments can increase crop nutrient uptake due to improved soil water and temperature conditions thereby significantly increasing aboveground dry matter and grain yields gan et al 2013 ding et al 2018 lastly it makes sense that the greatest effects of the mulching and ridging treatments on yield would be seen in the year with the precipitation distribution skewed towards the very sensitive reproductive and grain filling periods when each additional unit of available water impacts grain yield much more than during the vegetative growth period nielsen et al 2010 our results suggest that ridge furrow and film mulching production practices could help mitigate the negative effects of drought stress and improve soil hydrothermal states resulting in higher grain yields in extreme weather circumstances in dry sub humid regions resource use efficiency is very important for maintaining the sustainable development of agriculture increasing wue and pue has been a key objective in some areas where irrigation is limited gan et al 2013 both wue and pue can be significantly improved by using plastic film mulching for production of different types of crops in some arid semi arid and semi humid regions xiaoli et al 2012 zhang et al 2007 zhao et al 2014 in our study the mean wue and pue increased by 45 7 and 30 5 respectively with wrm compared with ck the respective increases in wue and pue were 34 1 and 23 5 with erm and 26 0 and 17 3 with efm compared with ck table 5 during the 2014 2016 growing seasons the tue was increased by 21 1 15 9 and 14 8 respectively with wrm erm and efm treatments compared with ck table 5 this may be because plastic film mulching and ridge furrow construction can create impermeable barriers to reduce soil water evaporation and runoff loss increase productive plant transpiration and utilization of soil water and heat resources and increase grain yields liu et al 2010a 2010b other studies have also shown that with increasing mulched ridge width maize wue and tue seemed to be improved through sufficient resource absorption and increased grain yields li et al 2017b wang et al 2015a the highest resource use efficiency in our study was observed with the wrm treatment and indicated that this planting practice could effectively use water and thermal resources to benefit the growth development and grain yield of maize therefore rfms with wide ridges and narrow furrows can significantly improve the water and thermal time use efficiency and lead to higher grain yields in dry sub humid regions of the loess plateau 5 conclusions in the dry sub humid areas of northwest china all three mulching treatments investigated in this study significantly increased soil temperature and moisture reduced intense soil evaporation and thus promoted maize canopy growth especially with the two rfms treatments in addition rfms significantly improved soil water availability through the highly efficient collection and utilization of rainwater increased soil temperature in the mulched ridges and captured more soil thermal time tts during the maize growing season the soil water storage and ridge soil temperature with mulching both increased with mulched ridge width in the rfms the optimized soil hydrological and thermal states accelerated maize growth and eventually increased grain yields and resource use efficiency in our three year study rfms significantly increased average maize yield by 24 9 32 8 wue by 34 1 45 7 pue by 23 5 30 5 and tue by 15 9 21 1 in comparison with ck moreover maize yield and resource use efficiency were sensitive to different ridge and furrow widths compared with the other treatments the wrm treatment produced more favorable soil hydrothermal conditions that resulted in vigorous crop canopy growth and the greatest maize yield wue and tue hence we recommend the wrm treatment rfms with wide ridges and narrow furrows is a promising and effective water saving maize cultivation practice to improve crop yields and resource use efficiency in dry sub humid regions declaration of competing

10266,the ridge furrow mulching system rfms is widely used to improve crop yields and water use efficiency in arid and semi arid rainfed agricultural regions however the effects of rfms on hydrothermal states and maize zea mays l yields in dry sub humid regions remain unclear the objective of this study was to determine the influence of ridge furrow construction and plastic film mulching on soil moisture and temperature evapotranspiration et maize growth and yield water use efficiency wue and thermal time use efficiency tue in dry sub humid regions of the loess plateau a three year field study was conducted in which four different planting practices were evaluated 1 alternating wide ridges and narrow furrows with film mulching wrm 2 alternating equal width ridges and furrows with film mulching erm 3 equal row spacing in flat plot with half film mulching efm and 4 conventional flat plot without mulching ck the results demonstrated that at early maize growth stages soil water storage within the 0 200 cm soil profile and soil temperatures were increased for mulching treatments compared with ck rfms utilized soil water efficiently by increasing rainwater harvesting efficiency and transpiration while decreasing soil evaporation rfms significantly increased soil temperature in the ridges by 4 0 4 4 c and reduced diurnal soil temperature amplitude in the furrows thereby increasing soil thermal time these positive effects of rfms compared with ck improved maize growth and crop yields because of adequate absorption and utilization of water and thermal resources rfms increased average maize yield by 24 9 32 8 wue by 34 1 45 7 and tue by 15 9 21 1 the highest grain yield wue and tue were observed with wrm due to its favorable soil hydrothermal conditions the wrm treatment is a promising water saving and high yielding maize cultivation practice to improve grain yields and resource use efficiency in dry sub humid regions keywords plastic film mulching ridge furrow soil hydrothermal maize yield water use efficiency dry sub humid regions 1 introduction water scarcity is a major global problem limiting crop growth and grain yields and has become more serious with increasing population in some arid semi arid and semi humid areas of the world li et al 2015 piao et al 2010 pinheiro and chaves 2011 in addition global climate change has influenced the quantity and distribution of rainfall in the past 50 years which has reduced crop water use and increased drought stress zhang et al 2014 the loess plateau is a main grain production area in northwest china and yields have been negatively impacted by water scarcity in the past 30 years li et al 2009 cold temperature stress caused by the high altitude of this area could also be considered as an adverse factor inhibiting seed germination and root activity thus reducing agricultural productivity bu et al 2013 even though the sub humid areas of the loess plateau have more precipitation than the semi arid areas drought stress occurs frequently during the crop growing season li et al 2017a crops in this area depend primarily on precipitation and most of the rainfall occurs between june and september owing to the continental monsoon climate uneven distribution of sometimes limited precipitation together with incongruous temperatures significantly restrict crop growth and agricultural productivity deng et al 2006 therefore it is extremely urgent to implement some effective crop management measures to obtain higher precipitation collection efficiency grain yields and water use efficiency mulching techniques have been widely adopted by farmers to improve food security in northwest china these techniques have included the use of plastic film mulch gravel mulch straw mulch and ridge furrow harvesting technology in the past 30 years bhardwaj 2013 plastic film mulching has been a useful water saving method in dryland areas especially for maize zea mays l which is widely grown in northwest china fisher 1995 liu et al 2009 plastic film mulching can provide favorable soil moisture and temperature conditions reduce non productive soil water evaporation and improve rainwater conservation thus increasing crop yields dong et al 2009 li et al 2013 accordingly this technology has the ability to increase crop canopy growth grain productivity water use efficiency and precipitation use efficiency bu et al 2013 however microclimate conditions in micro fields have been reported as being different under different types of plastic film mulches and planting patterns zhao et al 2014 in situ rainwater harvesting technology has been considered as an important measure to relieve drought stress in some semi arid areas of world hu et al 2014 mo et al 2018b the technology can change field micro topography improve runoff efficiency and increase soil water and temperature the ridge furrow harvesting technology combined with plastic film mulching has shown multiple effects in agriculture and this production practice has evolved and been widely adopted in some semi arid regions in china and africa gan et al 2013 hu et al 2014 mo et al 2016 in this rainwater harvesting system ridges covered with plastic film act as water collecting areas and the bare furrows receive water for plant growth gan et al 2013 li et al 2016 the ridge furrow mulching system rfms can significantly increase precipitation use efficiency reduce soil water evaporation and increase soil water content by concentrating light rains to increase infiltration to deeper soil layers wang et al 2008 rfms can help regulate the soil hydrothermal environment accelerate crop canopy growth and thereby increase crop productivity wue and economic benefits bu et al 2013 hou et al 2015 moreover the sizes of ridges and furrows in this system can affect soil water content soil temperature grain yield and wue wang et al 2015a zhao et al 2014 determining appropriate ridge and furrow widths is essential for developing more efficient rfms that will result in better soil hydrothermal conditions and increase crop yields wang et al 2015a 2015b previous research studies investigating different ridge furrow ratios have reported results for wheat triticum aestivum l maize alfalfa medicago sativa l oat avena sativa l and potato solanum tuberosom l li and gong 2002 ren et al 2016 wang et al 2008 2015a 2015b for instance li and gong 2002 found 120 cm ridges and 60 cm furrows produced the highest maize production li et al 2007 reported that soil water was greater for ridges with 60 cm width than for ridges with 45 cm and 30 cm widths these studies indicated that increasing mulched ridge width positively affected soil hydrothermal conditions resulted in increased crop yields and wue additionally wide ridges can reflect more light to the crops planted in the furrows thus increasing leaf photosynthesis and aboveground dry matter gan et al 2013 however crop yields cannot be increased without limit when increasing the mulched ridge width while maintaining the same planting density because of excessive plant competition in the furrows wang et al 2009 moreover wider ridges require increased labor costs and plastic film material costs which will decrease net economic benefit the use of plastic film can also cause negative effects on the soil environment and can lead to reduced crop production briassoulis 2006 hu et al 2019 meteorological conditions in the dry sub humid areas of the loess plateau have some similar characteristics to those found in the semi arid areas in that both areas usually suffer from some yield reducing drought stress during the crop growing season li et al 2016 additionally optimal ridge and furrow widths are affected by distinct environmental elements including climate characteristics rainfall soil class and crop species gan et al 2013 li et al 2008 although some work that has recently been conducted in sub humid areas indicated that rfms could be implemented in this area the mechanisms regarding the transfer and distribution of soil hydrothermal conditions that affect crop yields remain unclear additionally many previous studies have rarely investigated the combined effects of soil water and temperature for maize production in this area gaining a better understanding of the mechanisms would lead to optimized rfms design and improve crop water use modeling and thereby increase crop yields and resource use efficiency therefore a three year field study was carried out in the guanzhong plain region of the loess plateau which is characterized by a dry sub humid climate li et al 2016 the objectives of this study were to 1 compare the influences of different ridge furrow and film mulching patterns on maize growth water use thermal time use efficiency and crop productivity 2 investigate the mechanisms regulating hydrothermal states of different ridge and furrow widths under rfms and 3 identify promising mulching planting patterns in order to offer a theoretical basis for optimized dryland maize production in dry sub humid regions 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of experimental site the field experiment was carried out during the 2014 2016 maize growing seasons at the institute of water saving agriculture in arid areas of china of northwest agricultural and forestry university in yangling shaanxi province china 34 20 n 108 24 e 521ma s l the experimental site was located in a dryland area on the southern loess plateau of northwest china the mean annual evaporation is 1440 mm and mean annual precipitation is approximately 635 mm with an uneven distribution of precipitation due to the sub humid monsoon climate i e more than half of the total annual precipitation occurs during the summer between june and september the mean annual temperature is 13 c and the mean difference between day and night temperatures is 11 5 c the mean annual sunshine duration is 2196 h and the continuous frost free period is 169 200 days an automated weather observation station at the experimental site recorded the daily maximum and minimum air temperatures and precipitation during the three maize growing seasons fig 1 the total precipitation amounts for the three maize growing seasons were 379 5 mm 2014 283 9 mm 2015 and 264 1 mm 2016 the first year was a relatively wet year and the next two years were normal precipitation years the daily mean temperatures during the three maize growing seasons were 23 0 c 23 4 c and 26 1 c respectively the groundwater at the experimental site was below 50 m and therefore we ignored upward movement of soil water into the root zone basic soil properties in the 0 100 cm soil layer are listed in table 1 2 2 experimental design and field management the study was arranged in a randomized complete block design that consisted of three replications of four experimental treatments the four different planting patterns used during the study were as follows 1 wrm alternating wide ridges and narrow furrows with film mulching fig 2a 2 erm alternating equal width ridges and furrows with film mulching fig 2b 3 efm equal row spacing in flat plot with half film mulching fig 2c 4 ck conventional flat plot without mulching fig 2d the area of each experimental plot was 18 m2 4 m wide 4 5 m long and was bordered by high wide ridges to avoid runoff for the rfms treatments the ridges 60 or 80 cm width and 15 cm height were covered with 0 008 mm thick transparent and impermeable plastic film and served as rainwater collecting zones soil was placed on the edges of the plastic film to securely anchor it non mulched furrows 40 or 60 cm width served as rainwater receiving areas for the efm treatment the flat surface was covered with 0 008 mm thick transparent and impermeable plastic film in every other inter row space maize cv qinlong 11 was planted at the same planting density of 51 332 plants ha 1 in all four treatments fertilizers were applied to each plot at rates of 225 kg n ha 1 90 kg p2o5 ha 1 and 150 kg k2o ha 1 before planting the chemical fertilizers were spread on the soil surface and tilled into the topsoil no irrigation was applied during the three experimental years pesticides were applied regularly according to local agricultural management practices to maintain normal plant growth the summer maize planting and harvesting dates for the three growing seasons are shown in table 2 2 3 sampling measurements and data analysis 2 3 1 soil moisture in order to obtain the dynamic changes of soil water soil volumetric water content in the 0 200 cm soil profile was observed with a time domain reflectometry probe system trime pico iph germany soil water measurements were at 10 cm increments when the soil depth was 0 100 cm and at 20 cm increments when the soil depth was 100 200 cm the probe access tubes for the soil water measurements were installed in the middle between two maize rows fig 2 soil volumetric water content was measured once a week throughout the entire growing season and the values were the average of three replications the soil water storage sws mm in the 0 200 cm soil profile was determined as follows 1 s w s i 1 n 10 w i h i where i is the different soil layer n is the number of soil layers wi is the soil volumetric water content and hi cm is the soil layer thickness 2 3 2 soil temperature soil temperatures at depths of 5 10 15 20 and 25 cm were recorded from planting to harvesting by a series of mercury thermometers located in the middle between two maize rows in the rfms treatment plots the thermometers were placed in the middle of the mulched ridges and in the middle of the bare furrows the mean daily soil temperature was the average of the measurements at the two locations during the maize growing season soil temperatures were manually recorded every two hours from 8 00 to18 00 at all five depths once a week the mean daily soil temperature at one soil depth was computed as the average of the six time period readings the soil thermal time tts c d and thermal time use efficiency tue kg ha 1 c d 1 were calculated using the following formulas bu et al 2013 subrahmaniyan et al 2018 2 t t s t s t b 3 t u e y t t s where ts c is the mean daily soil temperature tb c is the base active soil temperature 10 c for maize miedema 1982 and y kg ha 1 is grain yield when ts tb tts 0 c d 2 3 3 leaf area index lai and dry matter accumulation the maize growing season in each of the three years was divided into five different developmental stages seedling jointing flowering grain filling and maturity at each maize growth stage three representative plants were randomly sampled from each plot to calculate the leaf area leaf length leaf maximum 0 75 according to mckee 1964 the lai was calculated according to the following equation 4 l a i l e a f a r e a m 2 p l a n t 1 p l a n t d e n s i t y p l a n t s h a 1 10000 m 2 h a 1 after leaf area measurements were completed the maize samples were chopped into small slices and oven dried initially at 105 c for one hour and subsequently at 75 c until a constant weight was reached to determine aboveground dry matter 2 3 4 evapotranspiration et and crop yield total evapotranspiration et mm in each plot was calculated as 5 e t p i δ w where p mm is total precipitation during the maize growing season i mm is irrigation equal to zero in this experiment and δw mm is the sws change in the 0 200 cm soil profile from maize planting to harvesting as each plot was surrounded by border ridges surface runoff was considered to be zero in addition deep percolation was assumed to be negligible because of the relatively low amounts of precipitation received during the growing season ten maize plants were randomly sampled from the middle portion of each plot at physiological maturity to calculate maize grain yield 2 3 5 water use efficiency wue and precipitation use efficiency pue water use efficiency wue kg ha 1 mm 1 and precipitation use efficiency pue kg ha 1 mm 1 were calculated according to the following formulas 6 w u e y e t 7 p u e y p 1 where y kg ha 1 is grain yield et mm is evapotranspiration during the growing season and p1 mm is the effective precipitation during the growing season 2 4 statistical analysis the anova procedure from spss statistical software ibm inc was used on all experimental data over the three growing seasons statistically significant treatment differences between mean values average of three replications were identified using the least significant differences lsd0 05 test figures were created using sigmaplot 12 5 software 3 results 3 1 soil moisture the soil water storage sws in the 0 200 cm soil profile in the three growing seasons was generally increased under all three of the plastic film mulching treatments compared with the ck treatment especially at the early growth stages fig 3 the sws changes under the different treatments were not the same in all three years and were closely related to differences in rainfall and air temperature fig 1 at the seedling growth stage the sws under wrm was 5 1 6 0 and 3 3 higher compared with ck from 2014 to 2016 respectively the effects on sws were followed by erm and efm treatments at this growth stage however there was an obvious reduction in sws for the erm and efm treatments compared with ck due to increased maize water consumption at later growth stages especially at flowering at maturity no significant differences were observed in sws among all the treatments the higher values of sws with the wrm treatment compared with the erm treatment during the maize growing season indicated the better water collection and storage capacity of wrm treatment the swc was influenced by the different mulching treatments and showed spatiotemporal variability fig 4 at the early maize growth stages seedling and jointing plastic film mulching significantly improved swc compared with ck specifically wrm and erm produced higher swc than the other treatments in the 0 60 cm soil layer however during the flowering grain filling stage the swc values under erm and efm were relatively lower than under ck in the 100 140 cm soil layer and the differences were more pronounced for erm at maturity the swc in the deep soil layers was slightly increased under the plastic film mulching treatments when compared with ck and no significant differences in swc were noted at any soil layers among all the treatments 3 2 soil temperature 3 2 1 the dynamics of soil temperature the dynamic changes of daily average soil temperature at the 10 cm soil depth are shown in fig 5 for the three growing seasons the three different mulching treatments produced similar warming effects on soil temperature additionally soil temperatures for the different surface mulching systems were influenced by the specific weather conditions in each study year fig 1 during all three maize growing seasons plastic film mulching significantly increased the daily average soil temperatures over those observed under ck especially in the ridges with mulching for the rfms treatments even though the soil temperature variations over time were similar in the ridges and furrows the warming effect on ridge soil temperatures was significantly greater than observed in the furrows for the rfms treatments daily average soil temperatures in the ridges increased with increasing mulched ridge width especially during early growth stages ridge soil temperatures were 4 2 4 6 and 4 4 c greater with wrm than with ck in the 2014 2015 and 2016 maize growing seasons respectively and 4 0 4 1 and 4 0 c greater with efm than with ck there were no significant differences in soil temperature without mulching among all of the treatments in addition the warming effects caused by film mulching were different in the different growth stages soil temperatures in the ridges with mulching were higher than with ck during the early growth stages but the effects decreased during the later stages at the emergence stage the two rfms treatments significantly increased the 10 cm ridge soil temperatures by 3 8 7 4 c compared with ck however the warming effects on the topsoil produced by the film mulching gradually became less as the maize canopy developed at the reproductive stage the 10 cm ridge soil temperatures with mulching were only 2 8 4 1 c greater than the ck temperatures during the three maize growing seasons 3 2 2 diurnal variation of soil temperature diurnal variations of soil temperature at the seedling and flowering stages during the 2014 and 2015 growing seasons are shown in fig 6 different mulching treatments showed varying effects on the diurnal variation of soil temperature but the patterns were similar at both growth stages plastic film mulching significantly increased soil temperature throughout the day compared with ck and the magnitude of the increase was greater when maize plants were small no significant differences in diurnal variation of soil temperature were detected without film mulching additionally the amplitude of diurnal soil temperature change was greater at the seedling stage than at the flowering stage the amplitude of the diurnal soil temperature change was smaller for the rfms bare furrows than for ck however that was not the case for the ridges with mulching in rfms the smallest diurnal soil temperature amplitude was observed in the bare furrows of the wrm treatment during the seedling stage the amplitudes of the diurnal soil temperature change in the wrm and erm bare furrows were 1 6 c and 1 1 c respectively less than observed in the ck treatment during the two maize growing seasons during the flowering stage the amplitudes of the diurnal soil temperature change in the wrm and erm bare furrows were 0 8 c and 0 6 c respectively less than observed in the ck treatment during the two maize growing seasons there were no obvious differences in the diurnal soil temperature amplitude between efm and ck 3 2 3 dynamics and allocation of soil thermal time tts table 3 shows the dynamics and allocation of tts at different maize growth periods for the 2014 2016 growing seasons the utilization mechanism of the thermal resource with the film mulching treatments was different from the ck treatment compared with ck the different film mulching treatments significantly increased tts throughout the growing season of all three years the wrm erm and efm treatments significantly increased tts by 10 3 14 1 8 6 11 5 5 6 8 0 respectively compared with ck these differences in tts due to film mulching were observed at each of the different maize growth periods the average tts values under wrm erm and efm were increased by 33 4 c d 26 1 c d and 21 4 c d respectively at pt ve by 54 2 c d 42 5 c d and 30 5 c d respectively at ve v6 by 49 3 c d 39 4 c d and 24 3 c d respectively at v6 r1 and by 70 3 c d 62 5 c d and 37 0 c d respectively at r1 r6 in comparison with ck the highest soil thermal time was observed with the wrm treatment maize aboveground dry matter was significantly increased and effectively converted to grain yield because of the greater available thermal resource with the wrm treatment 3 3 leaf area index changes in maize leaf area index lai over the three growing seasons are shown in fig 7 greater lai was observed for all of the plastic film mulching treatments compared with ck over the three study years at about 22 days after planting lai was very small for all treatments and there were no significant treatment differences however at the jointing stage about 38 days after planting maize leaves were growing vigorously and rapidly increasing in size and the lai differences due to plastic film mulching were clearly evident at about 65 days after planting the wrm treatment produced the largest lai values in all three study years at this time lai was 18 3 49 9 14 8 41 2 and 10 1 20 9 greater under wrm erm and efm respectively than under ck subsequently lai began to decline sharply for all treatments as maize plants entered the reproductive growth period at the maturity stage the rfms treatments still exhibited significantly greater lai than the ck treatment and no significant differences were observed between the wrm and the erm treatments 3 4 aboveground dry matter similar to lai significantly greater aboveground dry matter was also observed at most of the maize growth stages for the mulching treatments compared with ck fig 7 aboveground dry matter increased gradually as maize plants developed reaching maximum values at the end of growing season for each of the three study years at the maturity stage aboveground dry matter with the wrm treatment was 65 0 62 2 and 75 1 greater than that with the ck treatment from 2014 to 2016 the respective aboveground dry matter increases for the three study years were 44 9 55 4 and 63 4 with the erm treatment and 26 1 25 2 and 39 8 with the efm treatment compared with ck 3 5 crop yield wue pue and tue plastic film mulching treatments significantly increased maize grain yields during the 2014 2016 growing seasons table 5 with the greatest yields observed for the rfms treatments the mean maize yields for the different mulching treatments followed the pattern of wrm erm efm ck in all three study years compared with ck grain yields with wrm erm and efm were 70 5 48 7 and 46 5 respectively greater than the grain yield with ck in 2014 the respective grain yield increases for the three mulch treatments compared with ck were 13 7 12 1 and 7 8 in 2015 and 32 7 25 7 and 16 0 in 2016 the highest grain yield was produced with wrm which was likely a result of the more favorable soil water and temperature conditions grain yield with the erm treatment was not significantly different from the grain yield observed with the efm treatment the water use and thermal time use were markedly affected by mulching treatments in our study tables 4 and 5 efficient utilization of water and thermal resources under plastic film mulching facilitated the growth of maize and the formation of crop yield especially for the wrm treatment plastic film mulching treatments significantly increased wue pue and tue and decreased et compared with ck in all three experimental years no significant differences were observed in et between mulching treatments and ck in 2014 compared with the ck treatment the wrm treatment increased mean maize wue and pue by 45 7 and 30 5 respectively the respective increases for wue and pue were 34 1 and 23 5 with the erm treatment and 26 0 and 17 3 with the efm treatment the wrm erm and efm treatments increased tue by 21 1 15 9 and 14 8 respectively compared with ck over the 2014 2016 growing seasons no significant differences were observed for tue due to the mulching treatments compared with ck in 2015 this lack of a mulching treatment effect indicated that in this particular year grain yields for all of the treatments increased with increasing thermal units at the same rate 4 discussion 4 1 soil moisture the loss of large amounts of soil water to unproductive uses has been considered as a main factor contributing to land degradation in the loess plateau because of the uneven distribution of precipitation in this region water availability is sometimes not sufficient to sustain normal crop growth and can result in surface runoff bu et al 2013 chen et al 2015 in addition summer crops often suffer from drought at the seedling emergence and establishment stages mulching can significantly enhance soil water availability by reducing soil evaporation losses and increasing soil water storage gan et al 2013 ramakrishna et al 2006 in the current study we found that sws in the 0 200 cm soil profile at the maize seedling stage was significantly increased under the mulching treatments compared with the ck treatment in all three years of the study fig 3 this is likely due to the greater soil water evaporation losses under ck plastic film mulching can significantly reduce soil evaporation caused by the direct influence of solar radiation bu et al 2013 during the early stages of maize development plastic film mulching treatments significantly increased swc in the 0 60 cm soil profile especially under the rfms treatments fig 4 the two rfms treatments had the ability to decrease soil evaporation and improve rainwater harvesting efficiency and thus to increase soil water content li et al 2007 zhang et al 2011 however during the reproductive stages increases in sws under the mulching treatments were not observed and the swc values in the 100 140 cm soil profile with mulching were generally lower than observed for the ck treatment figs 3 and 4 this trend was more pronounced in the efm and erm treatments than in the wrm treatment it supported the point that maize plants under the mulching treatments had greater transpiration and consumed more deep soil water compared with the ck treatment during this period gao et al 2014 mo et al 2016 similar results were also reported by zhang et al 2011 and li et al 2017a they observed that at soil depths below 100 cm the swc under mulching treatments was lower than under the ck treatment at maize maturity sws recovered to a relatively good level due to decreased crop water consumption and soil evaporation as reported by mo et al 2016 the increase in swc under plastic film mulching can act as a sustainable water management practice to help mitigate the negative effects of drought li et al 2017a zhang et al 2019c the optimized redistribution of soil water can increase plant transpiration and photosynthesis rate and thereby increase crop yields compared with unmulched crop production all three mulching treatments in this study significantly increased soil water at early maize stages but the effects were somewhat different for the three treatments our data showed that the rfms treatments could direct rainwater to furrows so that maize planted in the furrows could make full use of rainwater however the runoff efficiency and rainwater collecting efficiency are determined by ridge and furrow sizes in rainfed agricultural areas wang et al 2015a in our study the wrm treatment with wide ridges had the greatest impact on soil water which led to improved rainwater harvesting efficiency and soil water retention capacity li et al 2017b zhang et al 2019a the wider mulched ridges increased the catchment area and reduced soil evaporation which directly affected the movement and distribution of soil water and resulted in greater concentration of rainwater in the maize root zone ren et al 2016 the efm treatment also harvested rainwater but only a small portion of the water reached the root zone because of intensive soil evaporation zhao et al 2009 therefore the wrm treatment should be recognized as a high water saving method because of its ability to optimize collection and use of rainwater which will have the effect of relieving the water scarcity problem in northwest china 4 2 soil temperature and thermal time tts low temperatures have been believed to be the factor accounting for limited seed germination and plant establishment on the loess plateau xiaoli et al 2012 plastic film mulching can decrease the latent and sensible heat exchanges between the soil and the surrounding air which significantly increases the surface soil temperature hu et al 2014 zhou et al 2009 but the warming effects of mulching are varied because of different mulching materials planting practices crop growing season and development stage in the current study plastic film mulching significantly increased the daily mean soil temperatures compared with ck during the 2014 2016 growing seasons especially in the plastic film mulched ridges fig 5 plastic film mulching accelerated seed germination and early plant establishment and changed the growth and development of maize in our study ridge soil temperatures were increased with increasing mulched ridge width suggesting that mulched ridge width is an important factor influencing soil temperatures in rfms zhang et al 2019a there were no significant differences in the bare soil temperatures among all the treatments during the three maize growing seasons the warming effects due to mulching followed the pattern of wrm erm efm ck the wrm treatment with the wide ridges and narrow furrows received greater solar energy at the soil surface resulting in the highest topsoil temperature in the ridges compared to the other treatments li et al 2017b a greater warming effect caused by mulching was observed at the maize emergence stage but the effect decreased with the development of maize similar results were reported by zhou et al 2009 and mo et al 2017 the mechanism for the increased surface soil temperature at early growth stages was that more longwave radiation was collected by the cover material gan et al 2013 mo et al 2017 however the increased warming of topsoil by the presence of mulch gradually decreased with increasing crop canopy development that intercepted most of solar radiation during the later growth periods li et al 2016 liu et al 2009 a primary purpose of plastic film mulching on the loess plateau is to increase topsoil temperatures when air temperatures are low zhang et al 2007 all the mulching treatments in this study significantly improved the diurnal variations of topsoil temperature at the seedling and flowering stages compared with ck fig 6 in addition the diurnal soil temperature amplitude was greater at the seedling stage than at the flowering stage the wrm and erm treatments exhibited smaller diurnal soil temperature amplitude in the furrows than ck over the 2014 and 2015 maize growing seasons fig 6 a similar response was not observed in the ridges with mulching for the rfms treatments zhang et al 2019b reported that the ridge furrow mulching systems decreased the diurnal soil temperature amplitude compared with the ck treatment across two study years especially under the higher mulch coverage ratio treatment which was identical to our results this may be because rfms could alter micro topographic heterogeneity by transforming the distribution of solar radiation and crest characteristics of soil surface and increased rainwater received in the furrows could affect diurnal variations of soil temperature jiang and li 2015 li et al 2019 therefore we arrived at a similar conclusion that the ridge furrow mulching system could decrease the diurnal soil temperature amplitude compared with ck it is well known that the soil thermal resource can significantly affect the growth of different types of crops especially for thermophilic crops such as maize subrahmaniyan et al 2018 in our study wrm erm and efm treatments significantly increased the soil thermal time compared with ck by 175 1 234 6 c d 146 4 173 6 c d and 94 1 133 6 c d respectively during the three growing seasons table 3 as a result greater thermal energy under the film mulching treatments promoted seed germination and plant establishment increased maize growth during the vegetative stage and prolonged the duration of the reproductive stage thereby increasing crop grain yields mo et al 2018a zhou et al 2009 we also found that compared with ck the increase in the thermal resource under film mulching treatments was greater during the r1 r6 growth period than during the other growth periods table 3 this finding indicated that the thermal resource during the reproductive stage was closely related to grain yields during this period large amounts of aboveground biomass could be effectively transferred from vegetative organs to grain yield which helped explain higher grain yields under mulching treatments bu et al 2013 zhang et al 2019b the higher grain yields under mulching were more obvious for the wrm treatment than for the erm and efm treatments with wrm showing the best regulation of crop physiological characteristics due to superior soil thermal conditions liu et al 2010b mo et al 2018a 4 3 maize growth and et maize growth is influenced by the transfer and absorption of different resources during the growing season such as soil water nutrients solar energy and thermal energy mwale et al 2007a 2007b mulching can regulate the relationship between soil water and heat thus changing the crop development process a previous study has shown that favorable hydrothermal conditions resulting from mulching could significantly increase lai and aboveground dry matter ultimately resulting in increased crop yields liu et al 2009 in addition rfms treatments may have promoted the growth of maize roots which would facilitate greater water and nutrient uptake gao et al 2014 liu et al 2009 2010b these resources would then be conveyed to the vegetative organs which would increase crop canopy growth ding et al 2018 in the current study all three mulching treatments significantly increased lai and aboveground biomass compared with ck over the 2014 2016 maize growing seasons especially under the rfms treatments fig 7 the greatest lai and aboveground dry matter were observed with the wrm treatment likely due to this treatment having the best soil water conservation and the highest soil temperatures zhao et al 2014 there were no significant differences in lai and aboveground dry matter between wrm and erm during the 2015 and 2016 maize growing seasons this may be because of similar soil water temperature conditions between the treatments in these two study years evapotranspiration et includes soil evaporation and crop transpiration crop transpiration comprises a large portion of et mo et al 2018b the et differences between the mulching treatments and the ck treatment were influenced by different precipitation patterns li et al 2013 found that plastic film mulching increased water availability by reducing unproductive soil evaporation losses similar to what we found the results of our study showed that the mulching treatments significantly influenced et compared with the ck treatment except in 2014 table 4 this may be because severe drought and high temperatures occurred at the early growth stages and more rainfall occurred at the later growth stages these conditions also led to decreased crop yield in 2014 table 5 as stated earlier plastic film mulching treatments can effectively decrease unproductive soil water evaporation and improve productive plant transpiration zhu et al 2015 ding et al 2018 this shifting of evaporation to transpiration with the plastic film mulch treatments increased maize growth aboveground dry matter and grain yields in all three study years fig 7 and table 5 4 4 crop yield water use efficiency and thermal time use efficiency plastic film mulching can significantly improve soil hydrothermal conditions and photosynthetic rate ensure the supply of crop available water and thus increase aboveground dry matter and crop yield on the loess plateau hou et al 2019 liu et al 2010b the lai aboveground dry matter and crop yield were increased by mulching in our study mean maize grain yields were increased by 32 8 with the wrm treatment by 24 9 with the erm treatment and by 18 9 with the efm treatment compared with ck table 5 the highest maize yield was obtained with the wrm treatment because of its great influence on soil moisture and thermal and light conditions the mechanisms responsible for the increased grain yield with the wrm treatment could be attributed to the following three factors firstly the variability of rainfall frequency and strong soil water evaporation both lead to lower soil water storage and inadequate crop growth mulching the soil surface with plastic film can increase topsoil water content by capillary action and vapor transfer bu et al 2013 moreover the wrm treatment ensured adequate soil water supply by increasing rainwater collection and utilization efficiency ren et al 2008 and decreasing soil water losses and surface runoff during critical growth periods liakatas et al 1986 secondly the wrm treatment produced favorable soil thermal states that avoided the danger of low temperatures and optimized the maize phenology period zhang et al 2017 lastly the wrm treatment can improve crop net photosynthetic rate by making full use of solar radiation thus increasing maize growth and crop yield gan et al 2013 rainfall plays an important role in grain yield formation in rainfed agricultural areas in the world li et al 2001 and many researchers have found that adequate rainfall significantly increases aboveground dry matter and grain yields cakir 2004 liu et al 2009 our results showed that rainfall during the 2014 growing season was more than observed in the 2015 and 2016 growing seasons but the grain yields were less for all of the treatments in 2014 table 5 these results were not in agreement with some previous reports eldoma et al 2016 jia et al 2018 a possible explanation may be that precipitation during the 2014 maize growing season was mainly concentrated in the grain filling and maturity stages which accounted for 68 5 of the precipitation fig 1 little precipitation was observed from maize seedling to flowering stages however a lack of rainfall at early stages of maize development restricted crop normal growth and higher rainfall at later growth stages could not be utilized effectively by plants in contrast rainfall was more evenly distributed in 2015 and 2016 resulting in higher maize yields similar studies have also reported that a large percentage of rainwater is lost by evaporation from the soil surface and that excessive rainfall may reduce maize photosynthesis and cause waterlogging stress in the field li et al 2017a zhang et al 2017 additionally severe drought and high temperatures were observed at the early growth stages of summer maize in our study these factors likely reduced 2014 maize grain yield table 5 the very large increases in grain yields in 2014 seen for the mulching treatments compared with ck could be explained by several reasons firstly the mulching treatments significantly improved soil hydrothermal conditions reduced intense soil evaporation and thus increased maize canopy growth resulting in higher grain yields compared with ck especially for the two rfms treatments although the mulched and unmulched treatments had similar et plastic film mulching could effectively decrease unproductive soil evaporation increase stomatal conductance and increase plant transpiration mo et al 2018b secondly rfms could enhance microbial activity and the rate of n mineralization and nitrification thus increasing fertilizer use efficiency and soil nutrient availability li et al 2017a thirdly mulching treatments can increase crop nutrient uptake due to improved soil water and temperature conditions thereby significantly increasing aboveground dry matter and grain yields gan et al 2013 ding et al 2018 lastly it makes sense that the greatest effects of the mulching and ridging treatments on yield would be seen in the year with the precipitation distribution skewed towards the very sensitive reproductive and grain filling periods when each additional unit of available water impacts grain yield much more than during the vegetative growth period nielsen et al 2010 our results suggest that ridge furrow and film mulching production practices could help mitigate the negative effects of drought stress and improve soil hydrothermal states resulting in higher grain yields in extreme weather circumstances in dry sub humid regions resource use efficiency is very important for maintaining the sustainable development of agriculture increasing wue and pue has been a key objective in some areas where irrigation is limited gan et al 2013 both wue and pue can be significantly improved by using plastic film mulching for production of different types of crops in some arid semi arid and semi humid regions xiaoli et al 2012 zhang et al 2007 zhao et al 2014 in our study the mean wue and pue increased by 45 7 and 30 5 respectively with wrm compared with ck the respective increases in wue and pue were 34 1 and 23 5 with erm and 26 0 and 17 3 with efm compared with ck table 5 during the 2014 2016 growing seasons the tue was increased by 21 1 15 9 and 14 8 respectively with wrm erm and efm treatments compared with ck table 5 this may be because plastic film mulching and ridge furrow construction can create impermeable barriers to reduce soil water evaporation and runoff loss increase productive plant transpiration and utilization of soil water and heat resources and increase grain yields liu et al 2010a 2010b other studies have also shown that with increasing mulched ridge width maize wue and tue seemed to be improved through sufficient resource absorption and increased grain yields li et al 2017b wang et al 2015a the highest resource use efficiency in our study was observed with the wrm treatment and indicated that this planting practice could effectively use water and thermal resources to benefit the growth development and grain yield of maize therefore rfms with wide ridges and narrow furrows can significantly improve the water and thermal time use efficiency and lead to higher grain yields in dry sub humid regions of the loess plateau 5 conclusions in the dry sub humid areas of northwest china all three mulching treatments investigated in this study significantly increased soil temperature and moisture reduced intense soil evaporation and thus promoted maize canopy growth especially with the two rfms treatments in addition rfms significantly improved soil water availability through the highly efficient collection and utilization of rainwater increased soil temperature in the mulched ridges and captured more soil thermal time tts during the maize growing season the soil water storage and ridge soil temperature with mulching both increased with mulched ridge width in the rfms the optimized soil hydrological and thermal states accelerated maize growth and eventually increased grain yields and resource use efficiency in our three year study rfms significantly increased average maize yield by 24 9 32 8 wue by 34 1 45 7 pue by 23 5 30 5 and tue by 15 9 21 1 in comparison with ck moreover maize yield and resource use efficiency were sensitive to different ridge and furrow widths compared with the other treatments the wrm treatment produced more favorable soil hydrothermal conditions that resulted in vigorous crop canopy growth and the greatest maize yield wue and tue hence we recommend the wrm treatment rfms with wide ridges and narrow furrows is a promising and effective water saving maize cultivation practice to improve crop yields and resource use efficiency in dry sub humid regions declaration of competing

10267,the farming practice of fully mulched double ridge furrow with polyethylene pe film has been widely used to improve productivity of many staple crops in arid and semi arid regions of northwest china however the residual pe film has caused many environmental problems such as white pollution and land degradation biodegradable film might be a good substitute for pe film in agriculture production but the evidence for the appropriate biodegradable film mulching pattern for maize is lacking a 2 year field experiment was carried out to identify a suitable biodegradable film mulching pattern for maize at a typical rain fed semi arid site on the loess plateau the local widely cultivated maize variety luodan 9 was sown in five planting patterns 1 conventional flat planting without film mulching ck 2 flat planting with full mulching with biodegradable film fb 3 ridge furrow planting with biodegradable film mulching on ridges rfb 4 double ridge furrow planting with full biodegradable film mulching drfb and with full transparent pe film mulching drfp the results indicated that biodegradable film mulching patterns including fb rfb and drfb significantly increased soil hydrothermal conditions improved leaf area index shoot and root biomass and thus enhanced maize yield and water use efficiency wue in comparison to ck p 0 05 among the three biodegradable film mulching patterns maize yield and wue in drfb average across two growing seasons were 9 7 and 11 7 significantly greater than fb and were 9 9 and 12 2 significantly greater than rfb in addition maize yield and wue in drfb did not differ significantly from those in drfp except that the maize yield was 5 2 p 0 05 lower than drfp in 2013 a warm and dry season present field demonstration clearly indicated that drfb could serve as a promising option to ameliorate soil hydrothermal conditions improve maize growth and yield performance boost wue and simultaneously reduce environmental risks such as white pollution in rain fed semi arid regions of northwest china keywords plastic film mulching patterns water use efficiency maize productivity environmental risks 1 introduction the global population is expected to reach 9 billion by 2050 and then the global food demand is projected to double that at the beginning of this century tilman et al 2011 however the area of arable land and the water for irrigation will not have increased or may even have decreased around the world due to its large human population this situation will be particularly severe in china especially in northern china which has 65 of the total arable land but less than 20 of the nation s total available water resources deng et al 2006 du et al 2010 gu et al 2019 precipitation is the main water supply to crop growth in northern china especially on the loess plateau ye and liu 2012 moreover lower soil temperatures particularly during the seedling stage is also a major factor limiting agricultural production in these regions liu et al 2009 hence methods that can effectively use of precipitation raise the soil temperature in the early growth season and finally achieve high crop yields are urgently needed in these areas since 1970 s the technology of film mulching on arable land surface has been widely used in arid and semiarid areas of china to increase crop yields gu et al 2016 liu et al 2009 ren et al 2016 therefore the use of plastic film mostly made from pe has enormously increased in most provinces and regions of china the amount of plastic film and mulched area in china had exceeded 1 5 106 t and 2 0 107 ha respectively and accounted for approximately 90 of the world s total usage amount national bureau of statistics of china 2018 the pe film is a polymer compound with very stable molecular structure which is extremely slow to degrade under natural conditions its degradation cycle can reach hundreds of years and some toxic substances will be released during its degradation yan et al 2006 currently only a small part of residual pe film is recycled because recycling consumes considerable time and money most of the residual pe film is left in the soil and thus resulting in increased soil hardness changes in soil permeability finally reducing crop production and restricting the sustainable development of agriculture dong et al 2013 kasirajan and ngouajio 2012 biodegradable film mainly made of starch and cellulose which can eventually decompose into co2 and h2o by the activity of microorganisms kapanen et al 2008 might be a desirable alternate to pe film by maintaining the advantages of pe film while eliminating its weaknesses gu et al 2017 many studies have compared the performance of biodegradable film and pe film on maize shen et al 2012 li et al 2020a 2020b and found that maize yield and water use efficiency wue did not differ significantly between the two mulching materials under flat planting patterns in recent decades the mulching patterns have developed from flat planting with mulching to ridge furrow film mulching and then to double ridge furrow film mulching kader et al 2017 the effects of the pe film mulching patterns on the soil hydrothermal environment plant growth yield and wue of maize li et al 2020a 2020b lin et al 2019 qin et al 2018 wu et al 2017 have been widely studied these studies showed that flat planting with mulching increases maize yield and wue by 14 0 49 5 and 5 2 22 5 and ridge furrow film mulching especially double ridge furrow film mulching can further improve maize yield and wue because the double ridges can more effectively harvest the limited rainwater yue et al 2011 while for biodegradable film mulching its heat and moisture preservation effects and rainwater harvesting efficiency were constantly changing with the degradation process thus whether the yield and wue improving effects under ridge furrow or double ridge furrow are superior to flat planting with biodegradable film mulching is unknown therefore present study analyzed in detail and compared the effects of different biodegradable film mulching patterns on soil hydro thermal conditions crop growth yield and wue of maize and with the aim of identifying an optimized biodegradable film mulching pattern which can simultaneously improve maize productivity and reduce environmental risks in a rain fed semi arid area 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of experimental site the field experiment was established from 2013 to 2014 at an agricultural experimental station 34 18 n 108 24 e 521 m a s l of northwest a f university yangling shaanxi china the experimental station is located in the southern part of the loess plateau in china the mean annual precipitation is about 560 mm with 65 of the rains concentrated

experimental field was classified as a clay loam with a field capacity wilting coefficient and dry bulk density of 0 34 m3 m 3 0 11 m3 m 3 and 1 40 g cm 3 respectively the soil nutrient concentrations at 0 50 cm depth in the experimental field are shown in table 1 the precipitations during the 2013 and 2014 maize growing seasons were 211 0 and 380 3 mm respectively fig 1 while the long term 1983 2012 average rainfall during the maize growing season was 350 8 mm according to the method of rainfall anomaly percentage lu et al 2009 the maize growing seasons of 2013 and 2014 were classified as a dry season and a season with normal rainfall respectively in addition the average seasonal temperatures were 24 4 and 23 3 c in 2013 and 2014 respectively 2 2 experimental design and field management

arranged in a randomized block design 1 ck conventional flat planting without film mulching fig 2a 2 fb flat planting with full biodegradable film mulching fig 2b 3 rfb ridge furrow planting with biodegradable film mulching only on ridges with the height and width of 20 cm and 50 cm respectively fig 2c 4 drfb double ridge furrow planting with biodegradable film full mulching fig 2d with the height and width being 15 cm and 60 cm for wide ridges and 20 cm and 40 cm for narrow ridges respectively 5 drfp double ridge furrow planting with transparent pe film full mulching fig 2e with the height and width being 15 cm and 60 cm for wide ridges and 20 cm and 40 cm for narrow ridges respectively the width of films was 0 8 m in rfb and was 1 2 m in fb drfb and drfp and all the films were 0 008 mm in thickness the maize variety luodan 9 was sown at a density of about 150 plants plot 1 66 250 plants ha 1 with row spacing as shown in fig 2 for each treatment with inter plant spacing of 30 cm for all treatments on june 16 2013 and june 18 2014 prior to the 2013 maize growing season winter wheat was planted in the experimental field with 180 kg n ha 1 in form of urea and 150 kg p2o5 ha 1 in form of calcium super phosphate before sowing and with 60 mm irrigation before jointing stage however between the two maize growing seasons no other crops were grown in the experimental field the harvesting of the plants in each treatment was carried out according to their respective maturity dates in each plot basal fertilizers including urea n 46 calcium super phosphate p2o5 16 and potassium sulphate k2o 51 were applied before the films were laid at rates of 150 kg n ha 1 120 kg p2o5 ha 1 and 100 kg k2o ha 1 respectively in accordance with local farming practice no irrigation top dressing fertilizers or herbicides were applied throughout the two maize growing seasons the corresponding treatment of each plot in the two year experiment was unchanged 2 3 measurements and methods 2 3 1 degradation of film the degradation of film was observed and recorded every 10 d after sowing the degree of film degradation was defined according to a 6 point scale yang and tang 1996 degree 0 meant there were no cracks in the film degree 1 meant the films had begun to crack degree 2 meant that 25 of the film appeared to show tiny cracks degree 3 meant that the cracks in the films were 2 2 5 cm in width degree 4 meant that there were no large pieces of film and the cracks were uniform and reticular degree 5 meant that the film was degraded into fragments smaller than 4 4 cm2 2 3 2 soil water content soil water content to a depth of 1 m was determined every 15 d after sowing to monitor the dynamics of soil water storage sws mm in the 0 40 and 40 100 cm depths across each growing season the soil samples were manually taken in each plot using a 70 mm diameter portable auger at a 10 cm interval between two successive plants in the same row the soil gravimetric water content gwc g g 1 was calculated on the basis of the oven dried soil samples dried at 105 c the sws was calculated using the following equation 1 s w s mm g w c γ g cm 3 s d mm where γ is soil bulk density of each soil layer and sd is soil depth 2 3 3 soil temperature in order to determine the dynamics of daily soil temperature throughout two maize growing seasons soil temperatures at 10 and 20 cm depths in each plot were recorded at 08 00 h 10 00 h 12 00 h 14 00 h 16 00 h and 18 00 h every 10 d after sowing using angle stem geothermometers jingda thermal instruments wuqiang county hebei province china geothermometers were placed at the center of each plot between two successive plants in the same row the mean values of the six records made each day in each plot were regarded as the mean soil temperatures at 10 and 20 cm depths the daily mean soil temperature was then calculated as the average of the mean soil temperatures at 10 and 20 cm depths soil effective accumulated temperature seat was calculated using the following equation 2 s e a t σ 10 t m e a n t b a s e where 10 is the measurement interval of 10 d t mean is the daily mean soil temperature c and t base is the effective base temperature c which is 10 c for maize hu et al 2016 if t mean t base the seat should be recorded as 0 c 2 3 4 leaf area index and shoot and root biomass five plants were cut at ground level for the measurements of leaf area la and shoot biomass at jointing filling and maturity stages in both growing seasons the sampled plants were separated into leaves stems and kernels green leaf area was calculated using eq 3 and leaf area index lai was defined as the ratio of la of each plant to the average land area occupied 0 15 m2 in this study after the la was measured leaves stems and ears were dried in ovens for 30 min at 105 c to deactivate enzymes and then at 75 c until they were reached constant weight the shoot biomass was the total oven dried weights of leaves stems and ears 3 l a 1 n l i w i 0 75 where l i is the midrib length of each green leaf m w i is the maximum width of each green leaf m n is the number of green leaves for each plant and 0 75 is the relationship factor of area from the measurement of length and maximum width and area from measuring by projected area francis et al 1969 for the determination of root biomass the root systems of five plants in each plot were sampled using a shovel to 40 cm depth at jointing kernel filling and maturity stages in both growing seasons the root samples were manually selected and washed carefully and then oven dried at 75 c for a minimum of 48 h until they reached a constant weight 2 3 5 yield and yield components at maturity plants in the middle two rows of each plot were sampled the ears were harvested shelled and air dried for the determination of kernel yield the moisture content of kernel was about 13 after air dried the yield components including ear length ear diameter kernel number per ear and 100 kernel weight of the twelve ears were also determined 2 3 6 water use efficiency wue water use efficiency wue kg ha 1 mm 1 was calculated as follows 4 w u e y e t where y kg ha 1 and et mm are yield and evapotranspiration of maize for each treatment in each growing season respectively in order to calculate the et of each treatment soil water contents to a depth of 2 m were determined before sowing and after harvest in each growing season then the swsbs sws before sowing mm and swsah sws after harvest mm were calculated using eq 1 et was calculated by 5 e t p i d r s w s bs s w s ah where p is precipitation mm i is irrigation amount mm which equalled zero in the current study because no irrigation was applied d is the deep drainage into the lower boundary of 200 cm mm which was assumed to be negligible in the current study because no heavy rains and irrigations occurred during each maize growing season r is runoff mm which was considered to be zero since each plot was surrounded by ridges to prevent the occurrence of runoff 2 4 data analysis all data are presented as the mean value of the three replicates spss 18 0 was used to conduct analysis of variance and the significance of differences between the treatments was determined by the least significant differences lsd test at p 0 05 level figures were created by origin 8 0 3 results 3 1 film degradation process the pe film used in the drfp did not degrade throughout either of the growing seasons whereas the biofilm in fb rfb and drfb gradually degraded from sowing table 2 the biofilm in fb rfb and drfb did not markedly degrade until 40 days after sowing das early jointing stage when 20 of film surface appeared as small cracks of about 0 1 0 3 cm wide degree 1 from then on a higher biofilm degradation rate was observed in drfb than in fb and rfb in 2013 a warm and dry season and in rfb and drfb than in fb in 2014 a cool season with normal rainfall in general the biofilm in fb rfb and drfb was degraded into fragments smaller than 4 4 cm2 degree 5 by 90 das late filling stage 3 2 temporal dynamics of soil water content in the 0 40 cm soil layer mulching treatments especially drfp consistently retained more soil water than the ck did over the two growing seasons fig 3a and b among the four mulching treatments sws in drfb and drfp was always higher than in fb and rfb before 75 das in both 2013 a warm and dry season and 2014 a cool season with normal rainfall with no significant differences being registered between fb and rfb across the entire growing season in either year however some differences in sws existed after 75 das between the two growing seasons due to different rainfall patterns significant differences were not found among the five treatments in 2013 except at 105 das but the sws in the four mulching treatments was still 6 7 29 9 p 0 05 significantly greater than that in the ck in 2014 in the 40 100 cm soil layer the sws did not differ significantly among all the treatments for most of the maize growing season except for the periods from 45 to 75 das in 2013 and from 60 to 105 das in 2014 fig 3c and d sws in drfb and drfp were 11 2 15 3 p 0 05 and 13 6 20 4 p 0 05 greater than ck from 45 to 75 das in 2013 and were 4 2 8 0 p 0 05 and 6 7 11 3 p 0 05 greater than ck from 60 to 105 das in 2014 respectively compared to ck the total sws from 15 das to maturity in the 0 100 cm layer was 6 5 21 1 p 0 05 and 5 8 17 7 p 0 05 greater in drfp and drfb for 2013 and was 5 1 30 4 p 0 05 and 4 9 27 3 p 0 05 higher in drfp and drfb for 2014 respectively fig 3e and f irrespective of treatment the average sws in the 0 100 cm layer from sowing to maturity was 30 4 p 0 05 higher in 2014 than 2013 3 3 soil temperature 3 3 1 temporal dynamics compared to ck the mulching treatments especially fb drfb and drfp significantly increased soil temperatures at 10 and 20 cm depths from sowing to about 70 das by 2 1 5 1 c p 0 05 and 1 9 4 4 c p 0 05 in 2013 and by 1 7 4 6 c p 0 05 and 1 4 3 8 c p 0 05 2014 respectively fig 4 among the four mulching treatments the soil temperatures at 10 and 20 cm depths in fb drfb and drfp were higher than those in rfb before 60 das in addition soil temperatures in fb were the highest from sowing to about 50 das in 2013 and to about 40 das in 2014 however after those time points in each season the highest soil temperatures were found in drfp because of the degradation of the biofilm in the other mulching treatments 3 3 2 soil effective accumulated temperature seat all four mulching treatments significantly increased seat compared to ck in both growing seasons fig 5 seat in drfp was consistently the highest during each growing season although it did not differ significantly from that in fb averaged across two growing seasons seat in drfb was higher by 187 c 10 3 p 0 05 and 93 5 c 4 9 p 0 05 in comparison to ck and rfb and lower by 65 5 c 3 2 p 0 05 in comparison to drfp respectively regardless of the treatments seat in 2013 was 214 6 c 11 5 p 0 05 higher than that in 2014 3 4 leaf area index lai and shoot and root biomass compared to ck mulching treatments significantly increased shoot biomass at the jointing filling and maturity stages in both 2013 and 2014 fig 6a b and c relative to ck the average shoot biomass of the four mulching treatments was improved by 70 8 p 0 05 57 0 p 0 05 and 30 5 p 0 05 in 2013 and 66 9 p 0 05 49 7 p 0 05 and 12 0 p 0 05 in 2014 at the jointing filling and maturity stages respectively drfp consistently achieved the highest shoot biomass at the three growth stages over the two seasons although significant differences were only observed at the maturity stage in 2013 between drfp and drfb in general shoot biomass was greater in 2014 than 2013 in all treatments similarly lai in ck was significantly lower than that in fb rfb drfb and drfp at the jointing filling and maturity stages regardless of whether the growing season was warm and dry 2013 or cool with normal rainfall 2014 fig 6d e and f among the four mulching treatments lai in drfb was almost equal to that in drfp and was significantly greater than that in fb and rfb at jointing filling and maturity stages in both seasons in addition lai at the jointing and filling stages was 7 7 25 0 p 0 05 and 6 5 20 7 p 0 05 higher in 2014 than that of 2013 respectively as with shoot biomass and lai significant improvements in root biomass associated with the mulching treatments were also found at the jointing filling and maturity stages in each growing season fig 6g h and i root biomass in drfb was significantly greater than that in fb and rfb and did not differ significantly from that in drfp at the three growing stages in both 2013 and 2014 taking all treatments into account root biomass at maturity was 20 8 42 6 p 0 05 greater in 2014 than in 2013 3 5 yield and yield components relative to ck the mulching treatments fb rfb drfb and drfp significantly increased ear length ear diameter kernel number per ear and 100 kernel weight by 11 2 18 2 p 0 05 3 3 6 6 p 0 05 14 3 31 3 p 0 05 and 6 8 15 4 p 0 05 respectively in 2013 and by 10 3 14 7 p 0 05 4 3 7 7 p 0 05 9 7 21 0 p 0 05 and 7 7 14 6 p 0 05 respectively in 2014 fig 7 of the four mulching treatments drfp consistently achieved the highest ear length ear diameter kernel number per ear and 100 kernel weight followed by drfb with no significant differences in these yield components being observed between these two treatments in either season as a result drfp consistently achieved the highest kernel yields followed by drfb with ck achieving the lowest yields in both growing seasons fig 7 compared to ck kernel yield was significantly increased by 55 6 p 0 05 in drfp 47 6 p 0 05 in drfb 31 9 p 0 05 in rfb and 34 5 p 0 05 in fb in 2013 and by 26 2 p 0 05 24 7 p 0 05 15 0 p 0 05 and 13 7 p 0 05 in drfp drfb rfb and fb respectively in 2014 in addition kernel yield in drfb was markedly higher than that in fb and rfb in both growing seasons compared with drfp drfb obtained 5 2 significantly lower kernel yield in 2013 a warm and dry season however significant differences were not observed between the two treatments in 2014 a cool season with normal rainfall regardless of the treatments kernel yield in 2014 was 33 9 p 0 05 greater than that in 2013 3 6 evapotranspiration et and water use efficiency wue the highest et was occurred in ck for both seasons table 3 and the et in ck was 3 9 10 0 p 0 05 and 4 7 8 2 p 0 05 higher than the mulching treatments in 2013 and 2014 respectively significant differences were not found between the et of drfb and drfp in the two growing seasons irrespective of the treatments the average et was 27 3 greater in 2014 than that in 2013 in both the warm and dry season 2013 and the cool season with normal rainfall 2014 wue in the mulching treatments were increased significantly in comparison to ck table 3 wue in drfb did not differ significantly from that in drfp in both growing seasons in 2013 wue in drfb was 15 0 and 14 0 significantly higher than that in fb and rfb respectively in 2014 wue in drfb was 10 4 p 0 05 greater than that in rfb but did not differ significantly from that in fb 4 discussion 4 1 film degradation the degradation rate of the mulch films depends mainly on the materials and the environmental conditions kasirajan and ngouajio 2012 in this study the biodegradable films started degrading visibly from 40 das early jointing stage and the degradation degree reached level 5 by about 90 das late filling stage table 2 among the three biodegradable film mulching patterns the date at which degradation first occurred in the ridge furrow systems was approximately 10 days earlier than that in the flat planting pattern table 2 this result was similar to the findings of shen et al 2012 and a large number of rapidly growing microorganisms induced by the wetter and warmer soil might be the main reason 4 2 soil water content by reducing soil evaporation film mulching increases soil water content furthermore by effectively collecting rainwater the ridge furrow systems with film mulching can further increase soil water content in the upper layer gu et al 2016 kader et al 2017 qin et al 2014 ren et al 2016 zhao et al 2014 in the present study the soil water content in the 0 40 cm layer was clearly higher in the mulching treatments fb rfb drfb and drfp than in ck especially at the early growth stages with the increased soil water content becoming less apparent in the late growth stages fig 3a and b previous studies had also shown this effect and had linked this variable soil water content increase to abundant rainfall and decreased evaporation in the late development stages when the plant canopy was larger zhao et al 2014 zhou et al 2009 of the four mulching treatments double ridge furrow systems with full mulching drfb and drfp accumulated higher soil water content in the 0 40 cm layer than fb and rfb did the fully mulched double ridge furrow patterns were found to channel rainwater which fell on the ridges to the surface soil within the furrows 0 40 cm and then infiltrated further into the deeper soil layers 40 100 cm zhang et al 2011 zhao et al 2014 the higher soil water content in the 0 40 cm layer in drfb and drfp was readily available to the crops planted in the furrows fig 3a and b while the water retained in the deeper soil layer 40 100 cm could be used by crops later in the growing season when crop water requirement is high and little or no incident rainfall is available gan et al 2013 in the present study soil water storage in the 40 100 cm layer was significantly higher in drfb and drfp than in ck from 45 to 75 das fig 3c and d 4 3 soil temperature compared to air temperature crop growth is more sensitive to soil temperature gan et al 2013 and is visibly affected by variations in soil temperature pramanik et al 2015 zhou et al 2012 in some cold temperate and highland areas film mulching has long been deemed as an effective agricultural practice primarily to increase soil temperature especially during the early growth period including germination of the crop bu et al 2013 wang et al 2011 zhou et al 2009 observed that soil temperature at 10 cm depth in fully mulched plots was on average 2 7 c higher than that of half mulched plots and 5 3 c higher than that of non mulched plots at the early growth stages with the soil warming effect of film mulches gradually diminishing at later growth stages gu et al 2017 also reported that film mulching increased topsoil temperature by approximately 2 0 c during the early growth period in winter rapeseed while no obvious differences were detected during the late growth period a similar result was found in the current study where soil temperatures at 10 and 20 cm depth under full film mulching treatments fb drfb and drfp were on average 1 4 5 1 c higher than the non mulched treatment ck and 1 3 1 9 c higher than the half mulched treatment rfb from 0 to 70 das significant differences in soil temperature were not found among the five treatments after 70 das fig 4 the main reason for the different soil warming effects within the growing season due to mulching was most likely attributable to the small plant canopy at early growth stages allowing most of the mulched soil surface to receive solar energy however when the plants grew larger at the later growth stages their leaves covered most of the mulched soil surface and blocked the sunlight reducing the soil temperature effect soil effective accumulated temperature seat is tightly linked with the process of crop growth and development hu et al 2016 demonstrated that seat was 4 6 8 7 significantly higher in mulched plots than in bare plots due to the soil warming effect of film mulching the results from the current study were similar to the findings mentioned above seat was higher in fully mulched treatments fb drfb and drfp than in non mulched ck and half mulched treatment rfb fig 5 compared to the 2014 season little rain fell and most days were sunny during the maize growth period in the 2013 season and this is likely the main reason that seat in 2013 was markedly higher than in 2014 fig 5 4 4 crop growth roots are an important organ for crops not only to absorb water and nutrients but also to synthesize numerous physiologically active substances the function of which are closely related to the growth conditions and distribution of the roots in the soil the absorption of nutrients and the formation of the final crop yield are the results of the combined effects of root morphological and physiological characteristics lynch 1995 previous studies had found that the root length diameter and dry weight were all significantly increased under film mulching treatments gao et al 2014 gu et al 2016 our study generated a similar result that root biomass under mulching treatments were all consistently higher than that in ck at the jointing filling and maturity stages in both seasons fig 6 due to the better soil hydrothermal conditions root biomass in double ridge furrow systems with full mulching with film drfb and drfp was significantly greater than that in a ridge furrow system with half mulching with film rfb and flat planting with full mulching with film fb fig 6 a well developed root system was beneficial for crops to absorb more soil water and nutrients and thus form a vigorous canopy and finally obtain greater kernel yield gao et al 2014 found that root biomass was positively and significantly correlated with maize kernel yield in the present study mulching treatments especially drfb and drfp resulted in markedly larger shoot biomass and lai than in ck fig 6 and ultimately resulted in greater maize yield and higher yield components fig 7 4 5 yield and wue previous studies had shown that mulching treatments significantly increased yield and its components in many staple crops as maize mo et al 2017 wheat chen et al 2015 potato zhao et al 2014 and rapeseed gu et al 2016 the results from the present study were similar in those mulching treatments regardless of whether it was biodegradable film or pe film fig 7 the increases in yield under film mulching especially double ridge furrow with full film mulching drfb and drfp could be attributed to 1 film mulching ensured enough water supply for crops during critical growth stages via reduced soil evaporation and improved rainwater harvesting and soil water conservation gu et al 2016 2 film mulching improved soil thermal conditions and thus optimized the crop phenological cycle such as shortened vegetative growth period and lengthened reproductive growth period qin et al 2018 and 3 more sunlight was reflected from the mulched films to the plant canopy which indirectly increased leaf area index and increased leaf net photosynthesis efficiency gan et al 2013 present study also observed that the maize yield in drfb did not differ significantly from that in drfp in 2014 a cool season with normal rainfall but was 5 2 330 kg ha 1 markedly lower than that of drfp in the warm and dry 2013 season with a well below average rainfall occurring during the maize reproductive period fig 7 this result might have arisen from the combined effects of rainfall conditions and degradation of the biofilm rainfall from august to maturity was approximately 250 mm higher in 2014 than in 2013 by the beginning of august the biofilm had degraded to level 3 which had therefore lost part of its rainwater collecting and soil moisture conserving effects in 2013 the effects of rainwater collection and soil moisture conservation on yield increase in drfp stood out because little rain fell after the biofilm had been degraded while in 2014 the abundant rainfall eliminated the worse effects of biofilm degradation on rainwater collecting and soil moisture conserving and drfb ultimately produced a yield similar to that of drfp in the present study film mulching treatments significantly increased wue by 22 31 71 16 compared with that of ck table 6 and this result was similar to those from earlier studies gan et al 2013 gu et al 2016 one key reason for that effect is that film mulching can effectively restrict soil water loss via soil evaporation and increase canopy transpiration biomass accumulation and ultimately grain yield liu et al 2010 our data revealed that film mulching caused a greater increase in grain yield and wue in a warm and dry season than in a cool and wet season the main reason is probably that ck plots lost more soil water through soil evaporation due to the high air temperature and smaller plant canopies in a warm dry season than in a relatively cool wet season in addition mulching treatments consumed more soil water via plant transpiration and thus gained greater grain yield than ck in a warm and dry season this study also found that wue did not differ significantly between drfb and drfp treatments in either season table 3 therefore in the long run the combination of double ridge furrow with full mulching with biodegradable film may act as a promising agricultural management system to improve maize yield and wue and to simultaneously reduce environmental risks in the semi arid loess plateau china 5 conclusions full mulching with biodegradable film over double ridge furrow drfb can improve soil hydrothermal conditions optimize maize growth and yield components compared to other biodegradable film mulching patterns maize yield and water use efficiency were significantly increased by 8 4 11 9 and 8 7 15 0 respectively the maize growth characteristics yield and water use efficiency did not vary greatly between drfb and drfp full mulching with transparent pe film over double ridge furrow in addition the biofilm in drfb had degraded into small fragments by the time the crop had reached maturity therefore drfb is a promising agricultural management system to simultaneously improve crop

10267,the farming practice of fully mulched double ridge furrow with polyethylene pe film has been widely used to improve productivity of many staple crops in arid and semi arid regions of northwest china however the residual pe film has caused many environmental problems such as white pollution and land degradation biodegradable film might be a good substitute for pe film in agriculture production but the evidence for the appropriate biodegradable film mulching pattern for maize is lacking a 2 year field experiment was carried out to identify a suitable biodegradable film mulching pattern for maize at a typical rain fed semi arid site on the loess plateau the local widely cultivated maize variety luodan 9 was sown in five planting patterns 1 conventional flat planting without film mulching ck 2 flat planting with full mulching with biodegradable film fb 3 ridge furrow planting with biodegradable film mulching on ridges rfb 4 double ridge furrow planting with full biodegradable film mulching drfb and with full transparent pe film mulching drfp the results indicated that biodegradable film mulching patterns including fb rfb and drfb significantly increased soil hydrothermal conditions improved leaf area index shoot and root biomass and thus enhanced maize yield and water use efficiency wue in comparison to ck p 0 05 among the three biodegradable film mulching patterns maize yield and wue in drfb average across two growing seasons were 9 7 and 11 7 significantly greater than fb and were 9 9 and 12 2 significantly greater than rfb in addition maize yield and wue in drfb did not differ significantly from those in drfp except that the maize yield was 5 2 p 0 05 lower than drfp in 2013 a warm and dry season present field demonstration clearly indicated that drfb could serve as a promising option to ameliorate soil hydrothermal conditions improve maize growth and yield performance boost wue and simultaneously reduce environmental risks such as white pollution in rain fed semi arid regions of northwest china keywords plastic film mulching patterns water use efficiency maize productivity environmental risks 1 introduction the global population is expected to reach 9 billion by 2050 and then the global food demand is projected to double that at the beginning of this century tilman et al 2011 however the area of arable land and the water for irrigation will not have increased or may even have decreased around the world due to its large human population this situation will be particularly severe in china especially in northern china which has 65 of the total arable land but less than 20 of the nation s total available water resources deng et al 2006 du et al 2010 gu et al 2019 precipitation is the main water supply to crop growth in northern china especially on the loess plateau ye and liu 2012 moreover lower soil temperatures particularly during the seedling stage is also a major factor limiting agricultural production in these regions liu et al 2009 hence methods that can effectively use of precipitation raise the soil temperature in the early growth season and finally achieve high crop yields are urgently needed in these areas since 1970 s the technology of film mulching on arable land surface has been widely used in arid and semiarid areas of china to increase crop yields gu et al 2016 liu et al 2009 ren et al 2016 therefore the use of plastic film mostly made from pe has enormously increased in most provinces and regions of china the amount of plastic film and mulched area in china had exceeded 1 5 106 t and 2 0 107 ha respectively and accounted for approximately 90 of the world s total usage amount national bureau of statistics of china 2018 the pe film is a polymer compound with very stable molecular structure which is extremely slow to degrade under natural conditions its degradation cycle can reach hundreds of years and some toxic substances will be released during its degradation yan et al 2006 currently only a small part of residual pe film is recycled because recycling consumes considerable time and money most of the residual pe film is left in the soil and thus resulting in increased soil hardness changes in soil permeability finally reducing crop production and restricting the sustainable development of agriculture dong et al 2013 kasirajan and ngouajio 2012 biodegradable film mainly made of starch and cellulose which can eventually decompose into co2 and h2o by the activity of microorganisms kapanen et al 2008 might be a desirable alternate to pe film by maintaining the advantages of pe film while eliminating its weaknesses gu et al 2017 many studies have compared the performance of biodegradable film and pe film on maize shen et al 2012 li et al 2020a 2020b and found that maize yield and water use efficiency wue did not differ significantly between the two mulching materials under flat planting patterns in recent decades the mulching patterns have developed from flat planting with mulching to ridge furrow film mulching and then to double ridge furrow film mulching kader et al 2017 the effects of the pe film mulching patterns on the soil hydrothermal environment plant growth yield and wue of maize li et al 2020a 2020b lin et al 2019 qin et al 2018 wu et al 2017 have been widely studied these studies showed that flat planting with mulching increases maize yield and wue by 14 0 49 5 and 5 2 22 5 and ridge furrow film mulching especially double ridge furrow film mulching can further improve maize yield and wue because the double ridges can more effectively harvest the limited rainwater yue et al 2011 while for biodegradable film mulching its heat and moisture preservation effects and rainwater harvesting efficiency were constantly changing with the degradation process thus whether the yield and wue improving effects under ridge furrow or double ridge furrow are superior to flat planting with biodegradable film mulching is unknown therefore present study analyzed in detail and compared the effects of different biodegradable film mulching patterns on soil hydro thermal conditions crop growth yield and wue of maize and with the aim of identifying an optimized biodegradable film mulching pattern which can simultaneously improve maize productivity and reduce environmental risks in a rain fed semi arid area 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of experimental site the field experiment was established from 2013 to 2014 at an agricultural experimental station 34 18 n 108 24 e 521 m a s l of northwest a f university yangling shaanxi china the experimental station is located in the southern part of the loess plateau in china the mean annual precipitation is about 560 mm with 65 of the rains concentrated from june to september the mean annual pan evaporation air temperature sunshine duration and number of frost free days are about 1500 mm 12 9 c 2196 h and 220 d respectively the soil of the experimental field was classified as a clay loam with a field capacity wilting coefficient and dry bulk density of 0 34 m3 m 3 0 11 m3 m 3 and 1 40 g cm 3 respectively the soil nutrient concentrations at 0 50 cm depth in the experimental field are shown in table 1 the precipitations during the 2013 and 2014 maize growing seasons were 211 0 and 380 3 mm respectively fig 1 while the long term 1983 2012 average rainfall during the maize growing season was 350 8 mm according to the method of rainfall anomaly percentage lu et al 2009 the maize growing seasons of 2013 and 2014 were classified as a dry season and a season with normal rainfall respectively in addition the average seasonal temperatures were 24 4 and 23 3 c in 2013 and 2014 respectively 2 2 experimental design and field management this field experiment consisted of five planting and mulching patterns for maize fig 2 each of which had three replicates with the replicate plots being 4 5 m in size the plots were 1 m apart and arranged in a randomized block design 1 ck conventional flat planting without film mulching fig 2a 2 fb flat planting with full biodegradable film mulching fig 2b 3 rfb ridge furrow planting with biodegradable film mulching only on ridges with the height and width of 20 cm and 50 cm respectively fig 2c 4 drfb double ridge furrow planting with biodegradable film full mulching fig 2d with the height and width being 15 cm and 60 cm for wide ridges and 20 cm and 40 cm for narrow ridges respectively 5 drfp double ridge furrow planting with transparent pe film full mulching fig 2e with the height and width being 15 cm and 60 cm for wide ridges and 20 cm and 40 cm for narrow ridges respectively the width of films was 0 8 m in rfb and was 1 2 m in fb drfb and drfp and all the films were 0 008 mm in thickness the maize variety luodan 9 was sown at a density of about 150 plants plot 1 66 250 plants ha 1 with row spacing as shown in fig 2 for each treatment with inter plant spacing of 30 cm for all treatments on june 16 2013 and june 18 2014 prior to the 2013 maize growing season winter wheat was planted in the experimental field with 180 kg n ha 1 in form of urea and 150 kg p2o5 ha 1 in form of calcium super phosphate before sowing and with 60 mm irrigation before jointing stage however between the two maize growing seasons no other crops were grown in the experimental field the harvesting of the plants in each treatment was carried out according to their respective maturity dates in each plot basal fertilizers including urea n 46 calcium super phosphate p2o5 16 and potassium sulphate k2o 51 were applied before the films were laid at rates of 150 kg n ha 1 120 kg p2o5 ha 1 and 100 kg k2o ha 1 respectively in accordance with local farming practice no irrigation top dressing fertilizers or herbicides were applied throughout the two maize growing seasons the corresponding treatment of each plot in the two year experiment was unchanged 2 3 measurements and methods 2 3 1 degradation of film the degradation of film was observed and recorded every 10 d after sowing the degree of film degradation was defined according to a 6 point scale yang and tang 1996 degree 0 meant there were no cracks in the film degree 1 meant the films had begun to crack degree 2 meant that 25 of the film appeared to show tiny cracks degree 3 meant that the cracks in the films were 2 2 5 cm in width degree 4 meant that there were no large pieces of film and the cracks were uniform and reticular degree 5 meant that the film was degraded into fragments smaller than 4 4 cm2 2 3 2 soil water content soil water content to a depth of 1 m was determined every 15 d after sowing to monitor the dynamics of soil water storage sws mm in the 0 40 and 40 100 cm depths across each growing season the soil samples were manually taken in each plot using a 70 mm diameter portable auger at a 10 cm interval between two successive plants in the same row the soil gravimetric water content gwc g g 1 was calculated on the basis of the oven dried soil samples dried at 105 c the sws was calculated using the following equation 1 s w s mm g w c γ g cm 3 s d mm where γ is soil bulk density of each soil layer and sd is soil depth 2 3 3 soil temperature in order to determine the dynamics of daily soil temperature throughout two maize growing seasons soil temperatures at 10 and 20 cm depths in each plot were recorded at 08 00 h 10 00 h 12 00 h 14 00 h 16 00 h and 18 00 h every 10 d after sowing using angle stem geothermometers jingda thermal instruments wuqiang county hebei province china geothermometers were placed at the center of each plot between two successive plants in the same row the mean values of the six records made each day in each plot were regarded as the mean soil temperatures at 10 and 20 cm depths the daily mean soil temperature was then calculated as the average of the mean soil temperatures at 10 and 20 cm depths soil effective accumulated temperature seat was calculated using the following equation 2 s e a t σ 10 t m e a n t b a s e where 10 is the measurement interval of 10 d t mean is the daily mean soil temperature c and t base is the effective base temperature c which is 10 c for maize hu et al 2016 if t mean t base the seat should be recorded as 0 c 2 3 4 leaf area index and shoot and root biomass five plants were cut at ground level for the measurements of leaf area la and shoot biomass at jointing filling and maturity stages in both growing seasons the sampled plants were separated into leaves stems and kernels green leaf area was calculated using eq 3 and leaf area index lai was defined as the ratio of la of each plant to the average land area occupied 0 15 m2 in this study after the la was measured leaves stems and ears were dried in ovens for 30 min at 105 c to deactivate enzymes and then at 75 c until they were reached constant weight the shoot biomass was the total oven dried weights of leaves stems and ears 3 l a 1 n l i w i 0 75 where l i is the midrib length of each green leaf m w i is the maximum width of each green leaf m n is the number of green leaves for each plant and 0 75 is the relationship factor of area from the measurement of length and maximum width and area from measuring by projected area francis et al 1969 for the determination of root biomass the root systems of five plants in each plot were sampled using a shovel to 40 cm depth at jointing kernel filling and maturity stages in both growing seasons the root samples were manually selected and washed carefully and then oven dried at 75 c for a minimum of 48 h until they reached a constant weight 2 3 5 yield and yield components at maturity plants in the middle two rows of each plot were sampled the ears were harvested shelled and air dried for the determination of kernel yield the moisture content of kernel was about 13 after air dried the yield components including ear length ear diameter kernel number per ear and 100 kernel weight of the twelve ears were also determined 2 3 6 water use efficiency wue water use efficiency wue kg ha 1 mm 1 was calculated as follows 4 w u e y e t where y kg ha 1 and et mm are yield and evapotranspiration of maize for each treatment in each growing season respectively in order to calculate the et of each treatment soil water contents to a depth of 2 m were determined before sowing and after harvest in each growing season then the swsbs sws before sowing mm and swsah sws after harvest mm were calculated using eq 1 et was calculated by 5 e t p i d r s w s bs s w s ah where p is precipitation mm i is irrigation amount mm which equalled zero in the current study because no irrigation was applied d is the deep drainage into the lower boundary of 200 cm mm which was assumed to be negligible in the current study because no heavy rains and irrigations occurred during each maize growing season r is runoff mm which was considered to be zero since each plot was surrounded by ridges to prevent the occurrence of runoff 2 4 data analysis all data are presented as the mean value of the three replicates spss 18 0 was used to conduct analysis of variance and the significance of differences between the treatments was determined by the least significant differences lsd test at p 0 05 level figures were created by origin 8 0 3 results 3 1 film degradation process the pe film used in the drfp did not degrade throughout either of the growing seasons whereas the biofilm in fb rfb and drfb gradually degraded from sowing table 2 the biofilm in fb rfb and drfb did not markedly degrade until 40 days after sowing das early jointing stage when 20 of film surface appeared as small cracks of about 0 1 0 3 cm wide degree 1 from then on a higher biofilm degradation rate was observed in drfb than in fb and rfb in 2013 a warm and dry season and in rfb and drfb than in fb in 2014 a cool season with normal rainfall in general the biofilm in fb rfb and drfb was degraded into fragments smaller than 4 4 cm2 degree 5 by 90 das late filling stage 3 2 temporal dynamics of soil water content in the 0 40 cm soil layer mulching treatments especially drfp consistently retained more soil water than the ck did over the two growing seasons fig 3a and b among the four mulching treatments sws in drfb and drfp was always higher than in fb and rfb before 75 das in both 2013 a warm and dry season and 2014 a cool season with normal rainfall with no significant differences being registered between fb and rfb across the entire growing season in either year however some differences in sws existed after 75 das between the two growing seasons due to different rainfall patterns significant differences were not found among the five treatments in 2013 except at 105 das but the sws in the four mulching treatments was still 6 7 29 9 p 0 05 significantly greater than that in the ck in 2014 in the 40 100 cm soil layer the sws did not differ significantly among all the treatments for most of the maize growing season except for the periods from 45 to 75 das in 2013 and from 60 to 105 das in 2014 fig 3c and d sws in drfb and drfp were 11 2 15 3 p 0 05 and 13 6 20 4 p 0 05 greater than ck from 45 to 75 das in 2013 and were 4 2 8 0 p 0 05 and 6 7 11 3 p 0 05 greater than ck from 60 to 105 das in 2014 respectively compared to ck the total sws from 15 das to maturity in the 0 100 cm layer was 6 5 21 1 p 0 05 and 5 8 17 7 p 0 05 greater in drfp and drfb for 2013 and was 5 1 30 4 p 0 05 and 4 9 27 3 p 0 05 higher in drfp and drfb for 2014 respectively fig 3e and f irrespective of treatment the average sws in the 0 100 cm layer from sowing to maturity was 30 4 p 0 05 higher in 2014 than 2013 3 3 soil temperature 3 3 1 temporal dynamics compared to ck the mulching treatments especially fb drfb and drfp significantly increased soil temperatures at 10 and 20 cm depths from sowing to about 70 das by 2 1 5 1 c p 0 05 and 1 9 4 4 c p 0 05 in 2013 and by 1 7 4 6 c p 0 05 and 1 4 3 8 c p 0 05 2014 respectively fig 4 among the four mulching treatments the soil temperatures at 10 and 20 cm depths in fb drfb and drfp were higher than those in rfb before 60 das in addition soil temperatures in fb were the highest from sowing to about 50 das in 2013 and to about 40 das in 2014 however after those time points in each season the highest soil temperatures were found in drfp because of the degradation of the biofilm in the other mulching treatments 3 3 2 soil effective accumulated temperature seat all four mulching treatments significantly increased seat compared to ck in both growing seasons fig 5 seat in drfp was consistently the highest during each growing season although it did not differ significantly from that in fb averaged across two growing seasons seat in drfb was higher by 187 c 10 3 p 0 05 and 93 5 c 4 9 p 0 05 in comparison to ck and rfb and lower by 65 5 c 3 2 p 0 05 in comparison to drfp respectively regardless of the treatments seat in 2013 was 214 6 c 11 5 p 0 05 higher than that in 2014 3 4 leaf area index lai and shoot and root biomass compared to ck mulching treatments significantly increased shoot biomass at the jointing filling and maturity stages in both 2013 and 2014 fig 6a b and c relative to ck the average shoot biomass of the four mulching treatments was improved by 70 8 p 0 05 57 0 p 0 05 and 30 5 p 0 05 in 2013 and 66 9 p 0 05 49 7 p 0 05 and 12 0 p 0 05 in 2014 at the jointing filling and maturity stages respectively drfp consistently achieved the highest shoot biomass at the three growth stages over the two seasons although significant differences were only observed at the maturity stage in 2013 between drfp and drfb in general shoot biomass was greater in 2014 than 2013 in all treatments similarly lai in ck was significantly lower than that in fb rfb drfb and drfp at the jointing filling and maturity stages regardless of whether the growing season was warm and dry 2013 or cool with normal rainfall 2014 fig 6d e and f among the four mulching treatments lai in drfb was almost equal to that in drfp and was significantly greater than that in fb and rfb at jointing filling and maturity stages in both seasons in addition lai at the jointing and filling stages was 7 7 25 0 p 0 05 and 6 5 20 7 p 0 05 higher in 2014 than that of 2013 respectively as with shoot biomass and lai significant improvements in root biomass associated with the mulching treatments were also found at the jointing filling and maturity stages in each growing season fig 6g h and i root biomass in drfb was significantly greater than that in fb and rfb and did not differ significantly from that in drfp at the three growing stages in both 2013 and 2014 taking all treatments into account root biomass at maturity was 20 8 42 6 p 0 05 greater in 2014 than in 2013 3 5 yield and yield components relative to ck the mulching treatments fb rfb drfb and drfp significantly increased ear length ear diameter kernel number per ear and 100 kernel weight by 11 2 18 2 p 0 05 3 3 6 6 p 0 05 14 3 31 3 p 0 05 and 6 8 15 4 p 0 05 respectively in 2013 and by 10 3 14 7 p 0 05 4 3 7 7 p 0 05 9 7 21 0 p 0 05 and 7 7 14 6 p 0 05 respectively in 2014 fig 7 of the four mulching treatments drfp consistently achieved the highest ear length ear diameter kernel number per ear and 100 kernel weight followed by drfb with no significant differences in these yield components being observed between these two treatments in either season as a result drfp consistently achieved the highest kernel yields followed by drfb with ck achieving the lowest yields in both growing seasons fig 7 compared to ck kernel yield was significantly increased by 55 6 p 0 05 in drfp 47 6 p 0 05 in drfb 31 9 p 0 05 in rfb and 34 5 p 0 05 in fb in 2013 and by 26 2 p 0 05 24 7 p 0 05 15 0 p 0 05 and 13 7 p 0 05 in drfp drfb rfb and fb respectively in 2014 in addition kernel yield in drfb was markedly higher than that in fb and rfb in both growing seasons compared with drfp drfb obtained 5 2 significantly lower kernel yield in 2013 a warm and dry season however significant differences were not observed between the two treatments in 2014 a cool season with normal rainfall regardless of the treatments kernel yield in 2014 was 33 9 p 0 05 greater than that in 2013 3 6 evapotranspiration et and water use efficiency wue the highest et was occurred in ck for both seasons table 3 and the et in ck was 3 9 10 0 p 0 05 and 4 7 8 2 p 0 05 higher than the mulching treatments in 2013 and 2014 respectively significant differences were not found between the et of drfb and drfp in the two growing seasons irrespective of the treatments the average et was 27 3 greater in 2014 than that in 2013 in both the warm and dry season 2013 and the cool season with normal rainfall 2014 wue in the mulching treatments were increased significantly in comparison to ck table 3 wue in drfb did not differ significantly from that in drfp in both growing seasons in 2013 wue in drfb was 15 0 and 14 0 significantly higher than that in fb and rfb respectively in 2014 wue in drfb was 10 4 p 0 05 greater than that in rfb but did not differ significantly from that in fb 4 discussion 4 1 film degradation the degradation rate of the mulch films depends mainly on the materials and the environmental conditions kasirajan and ngouajio 2012 in this study the biodegradable films started degrading visibly from 40 das early jointing stage and the degradation degree reached level 5 by about 90 das late filling stage table 2 among the three biodegradable film mulching patterns the date at which degradation first occurred in the ridge furrow systems was approximately 10 days earlier than that in the flat planting pattern table 2 this result was similar to the findings of shen et al 2012 and a large number of rapidly growing microorganisms induced by the wetter and warmer soil might be the main reason 4 2 soil water content by reducing soil evaporation film mulching increases soil water content furthermore by effectively collecting rainwater the ridge furrow systems with film mulching can further increase soil water content in the upper layer gu et al 2016 kader et al 2017 qin et al 2014 ren et al 2016 zhao et al 2014 in the present study the soil water content in the 0 40 cm layer was clearly higher in the mulching treatments fb rfb drfb and drfp than in ck especially at the early growth stages with the increased soil water content becoming less apparent in the late growth stages fig 3a and b previous studies had also shown this effect and had linked this variable soil water content increase to abundant rainfall and decreased evaporation in the late development stages when the plant canopy was larger zhao et al 2014 zhou et al 2009 of the four mulching treatments double ridge furrow systems with full mulching drfb and drfp accumulated higher soil water content in the 0 40 cm layer than fb and rfb did the fully mulched double ridge furrow patterns were found to channel rainwater which fell on the ridges to the surface soil within the furrows 0 40 cm and then infiltrated further into the deeper soil layers 40 100 cm zhang et al 2011 zhao et al 2014 the higher soil water content in the 0 40 cm layer in drfb and drfp was readily available to the crops planted in the furrows fig 3a and b while the water retained in the deeper soil layer 40 100 cm could be used by crops later in the growing season when crop water requirement is high and little or no incident rainfall is available gan et al 2013 in the present study soil water storage in the 40 100 cm layer was significantly higher in drfb and drfp than in ck from 45 to 75 das fig 3c and d 4 3 soil temperature compared to air temperature crop growth is more sensitive to soil temperature gan et al 2013 and is visibly affected by variations in soil temperature pramanik et al 2015 zhou et al 2012 in some cold temperate and highland areas film mulching has long been deemed as an effective agricultural practice primarily to increase soil temperature especially during the early growth period including germination of the crop bu et al 2013 wang et al 2011 zhou et al 2009 observed that soil temperature at 10 cm depth in fully mulched plots was on average 2 7 c higher than that of half mulched plots and 5 3 c higher than that of non mulched plots at the early growth stages with the soil warming effect of film mulches gradually diminishing at later growth stages gu et al 2017 also reported that film mulching increased topsoil temperature by approximately 2 0 c during the early growth period in winter rapeseed while no obvious differences were detected during the late growth period a similar result was found in the current study where soil temperatures at 10 and 20 cm depth under full film mulching treatments fb drfb and drfp were on average 1 4 5 1 c higher than the non mulched treatment ck and 1 3 1 9 c higher than the half mulched treatment rfb from 0 to 70 das significant differences in soil temperature were not found among the five treatments after 70 das fig 4 the main reason for the different soil warming effects within the growing season due to mulching was most likely attributable to the small plant canopy at early growth stages allowing most of the mulched soil surface to receive solar energy however when the plants grew larger at the later growth stages their leaves covered most of the mulched soil surface and blocked the sunlight reducing the soil temperature effect soil effective accumulated temperature seat is tightly linked with the process of crop growth and development hu et al 2016 demonstrated that seat was 4 6 8 7 significantly higher in mulched plots than in bare plots due to the soil warming effect of film mulching the results from the current study were similar to the findings mentioned above seat was higher in fully mulched treatments fb drfb and drfp than in non mulched ck and half mulched treatment rfb fig 5 compared to the 2014 season little rain fell and most days were sunny during the maize growth period in the 2013 season and this is likely the main reason that seat in 2013 was markedly higher than in 2014 fig 5 4 4 crop growth roots are an important organ for crops not only to absorb water and nutrients but also to synthesize numerous physiologically active substances the function of which are closely related to the growth conditions and distribution of the roots in the soil the absorption of nutrients and the formation of the final crop yield are the results of the combined effects of root morphological and physiological characteristics lynch 1995 previous studies had found that the root length diameter and dry weight were all significantly increased under film mulching treatments gao et al 2014 gu et al 2016 our study generated a similar result that root biomass under mulching treatments were all consistently higher than that in ck at the jointing filling and maturity stages in both seasons fig 6 due to the better soil hydrothermal conditions root biomass in double ridge furrow systems with full mulching with film drfb and drfp was significantly greater than that in a ridge furrow system with half mulching with film rfb and flat planting with full mulching with film fb fig 6 a well developed root system was beneficial for crops to absorb more soil water and nutrients and thus form a vigorous canopy and finally obtain greater kernel yield gao et al 2014 found that root biomass was positively and significantly correlated with maize kernel yield in the present study mulching treatments especially drfb and drfp resulted in markedly larger shoot biomass and lai than in ck fig 6 and ultimately resulted in greater maize yield and higher yield components fig 7 4 5 yield and wue previous studies had shown that mulching treatments significantly increased yield and its components in many staple crops as maize mo et al 2017 wheat chen et al 2015 potato zhao et al 2014 and rapeseed gu et al 2016 the results from the present study were similar in those mulching treatments regardless of whether it was biodegradable film or pe film fig 7 the increases in yield under film mulching especially double ridge furrow with full film mulching drfb and drfp could be attributed to 1 film mulching ensured enough water supply for crops during critical growth stages via reduced soil evaporation and improved rainwater harvesting and soil water conservation gu et al 2016 2 film mulching improved soil thermal conditions and thus optimized the crop phenological cycle such as shortened vegetative growth period and lengthened reproductive growth period qin et al 2018 and 3 more sunlight was reflected from the mulched films to the plant canopy which indirectly increased leaf area index and increased leaf net photosynthesis efficiency gan et al 2013 present study also observed that the maize yield in drfb did not differ significantly from that in drfp in 2014 a cool season with normal rainfall but was 5 2 330 kg ha 1 markedly lower than that of drfp in the warm and dry 2013 season with a well below average rainfall occurring during the maize reproductive period fig 7 this result might have arisen from the combined effects of rainfall conditions and degradation of the biofilm rainfall from august to maturity was approximately 250 mm higher in 2014 than in 2013 by the beginning of august the biofilm had degraded to level 3 which had therefore lost part of its rainwater collecting and soil moisture conserving effects in 2013 the effects of rainwater collection and soil moisture conservation on yield increase in drfp stood out because little rain fell after the biofilm had been degraded while in 2014 the abundant rainfall eliminated the worse effects of biofilm degradation on rainwater collecting and soil moisture conserving and drfb ultimately produced a yield similar to that of drfp in the present study film mulching treatments significantly increased wue by 22 31 71 16 compared with that of ck table 6 and this result was similar to those from earlier studies gan et al 2013 gu et al 2016 one key reason for that effect is that film mulching can effectively restrict soil water loss via soil evaporation and increase canopy transpiration biomass accumulation and ultimately grain yield liu et al 2010 our data revealed that film mulching caused a greater increase in grain yield and wue in a warm and dry season than in a cool and wet season the main reason is probably that ck plots lost more soil water through soil evaporation due to the high air temperature and smaller plant canopies in a warm dry season than in a relatively cool wet season in addition mulching treatments consumed more soil water via plant transpiration and thus gained greater grain yield than ck in a warm and dry season this study also found that wue did not differ significantly between drfb and drfp treatments in either season table 3 therefore in the long run the combination of double ridge furrow with full mulching with biodegradable film may act as a promising agricultural management system to improve maize yield and wue and to simultaneously reduce environmental risks in the semi arid loess plateau china 5 conclusions full mulching with biodegradable film over double ridge furrow drfb can improve soil hydrothermal conditions optimize maize growth and yield components compared to other biodegradable film mulching patterns maize yield and water use efficiency were significantly increased by 8 4 11 9 and 8 7 15 0 respectively the maize growth characteristics yield and water use efficiency did not vary greatly between drfb and drfp full mulching with transparent pe film over double ridge furrow in addition the biofilm in drfb had degraded into small fragments by the time the crop had reached maturity therefore drfb is a promising agricultural management system to simultaneously improve crop

10268,olive trees are harvested in late summer or during the fall in the mediterranean basin with considerable rainfall often occurring after harvest which largely eliminates the need to irrigate at that time as olive cultivation has expanded to new regions it has become necessary to develop new water management strategies to account for non mediterranean climate conditions in northwestern argentina olive cultivars are harvested as early as mid summer for green table olive processing but rainfall is low and temperatures remain high after harvest thus we evaluated the responses of yield determinants and components crop water productivity and vegetative growth of olive trees cv manzanilla fina to different post harvest irrigation levels in three growing seasons a fully irrigated control 100 crop evapotranspiration etc and three regulated deficit irrigation treatments rdi t66 66 etc t33 33 etc t0 0 etc were applied for 75 days after harvest from mid summer to mid fall the rdi treatments received irrigation equivalent to the control during the rest of the year the return flowering in the spring after the first season of rdi tended to be greater in t0 than in the well watered control and other rdi treatments despite some decrease in fruit set this led to a significant increase in fruit number and yield in t0 compared to the control and the other rdi treatments in contrast flowering tended to be lower in t0 than in the irrigated control t66 and t33 following the second season of rdi but fruit number and yield were not different at harvest similarly no differences in fruit number and yield were observed after the third rdi season cumulative total yield over the three seasons was not significantly affected by applying post harvest rdi crop water productivity expressed as fruit yield per amount of annual irrigation plus effective rainfall was significantly higher in t0 than in the control after the first and second seasons of rdi shoot growth during the rdi period was very low and only reduced significantly during the third rdi period the results suggest that alternative irrigation strategies that adapt to regional climatic conditions should be further developed in non mediterranean climates water savings up to 20 per year appear feasible with post harvest rdi in northwestern argentina without significant losses in yield keywords

harvest in late summer or autumn fernández et al 2015 flowering also occurs in the spring and flowering intensity depends on several factors including the number of buds formed on shoot growth from the previous season and the accumulation of chilling hours during the fall and winter lavee 1996 aybar et al 2015 haberman et al 2017 fruit number is strongly determined by flowering intensity although flower quality and the percentage of fruit set should also be considered rapoport 2014 a given growing season is termed to be an on year when fruit number is high and is often followed by a growing season with little fruit load called an off year lavee 2007 smith and samach 2013 olive harvest occurs in the late summer or fall in the mediterranean basin cano lamadrid et al 2015 rallo and cuevas 2017 however table olive cultivars are harvested at the green yellowish maturity stage for brine processing as early as mid summer in northwestern argentina due to the warm temperatures in the region that lead to early flowering and fruit growth correa tedesco et al 2010 searles et al 2011 supplementary irrigation of olive trees increases vegetative growth and fruit yield in areas of low rainfall moriana et al 2003 fernandes silva et al 2010 cajias et al 2016 on the other hand numerous studies have found that sustainable moderate yields can be generated in commercial olive orchards without the need to irrigate with 100 of crop evapotranspiration etc reviewed by connor and fereres 2005 fernández 2014 sustained deficit irrigation sdi which consists of applying less than 100 etc throughout the growing season somewhat reduces yield and vegetative growth but the water savings are considerable and the lower vegetative growth can be beneficial in mature orchards by controlling canopy size and potentially reducing pruning frequency goldhamer et al 1993 girona et al 2002 iniesta et al 2009 corell et al 2019 in northwestern argentina correa tedesco et al 2010 observed that the application of only 66 etc over the entire growing season in a table olive cultivar cv manzanilla fina led to mild water stress which decreased fruit yield by 25 and shoot growth by 50 compared to a well watered control along with the water savings irrigation water productivity expressed as fruit yield per mm of irrigation applied increased by 60 another strategy in fruit trees is regulated deficit irrigation rdi in which less than 100 etc is applied in one or more specific phenological stages that are likely to be fairly insensitive to water deficit reviewed by naor 2006 pérez pastor et al 2016 regulated deficit irrigation has been applied successfully during the pit hardening phase and the beginning of the oil accumulation phase in olive oil cultivars in the summer in the mediterranean basin e g tognetti et al 2006 lavee et al 2007 gómez del campo 2013a 2013b gucci et al 2019 although rdi in these stages can somewhat decrease oil yield approx 20 if irrigation is markedly reduced 50 etc water savings are considerable because evapotranspiration is very high in the summer post harvest rdi is applied after harvest when crop water demand may still be high in many fruit trees and its effects on vegetative growth for the remainder of the growing season and on flowering and yield the following growing season are determined it has often been used without yield reductions in several fruit tree species including loquat hueso and cuevas 2010 cuevas et al 2012 cherry blanco et al 2019 2020 carrasco benavides et al 2020 nectarine de la rosa et al 2016 and peach larson et al 1988 johnson et al 1992 wang et al 2020 girón et al 2015 noted that post harvest rdi has been little explored in olive trees a moderate post harvest rdi 50 etc for three months after an early table olive harvest in the sonora desert of mexico did not affect vegetative growth or return flowering but fruit set and yield were decreased the following season grijalva contreras et al 2013 further studies over more seasons are currently needed to better assess potential post harvest rdi yield responses in olive irrigation is normally applied the entire year in olive orchards in northwestern argentina because rainfall is very scarce and is concentrated in the summer months as heavy downpours gómez del campo et al 2010 searles et al 2011 torres et al 2017 thus irrigation strategies likely should be different from those of the mediterranean basin where most irrigation occurs in the fall and winter as an example suspension of irrigation for six weeks during the winter in northwestern argentina led to a mild water stress and did not show a significant reduction in the fruit yield the following season rousseaux et al 2008 but longer periods of irrigation suspension or deficit irrigation in winter and early spring did lower fruit and oil yield pierantozzi et al 2014 a crop coefficient of 0 4 was calculated for the winter months when rainfall is rare and 0 7 for the remainder of the year in northwestern argentina based on sap flow measurements rousseaux et al 2009 the objective of the current study was to evaluate the responses of yield determinants and components crop water productivity and vegetative growth of olive trees cv manzanilla fina to different post harvest irrigation levels in three growing seasons because rainfall can be scarce during this period mid summer and fall an evaluation of several plant indicators and soil moisture content to post harvest rdi in the same experiment found that irrigation equivalent to 33 etc or no irrigation was necessary to reduce midday stem water potential in northwest argentina agüero alcaras et al 2016 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site post harvest rdi was applied during three growing seasons 2008 09 2009 10 2010 11 in a commercial olive orchard located 15 km east of aimogasta la rioja in northwest argentina lat 28 35 s long 66 42 w 790 m above mean sea level the trees olea europaea l cv manzanilla fina were 10 years old at the start of the experiment row orientation was north south with a tree spacing of 4 m within the row and 8 m between rows 312 trees ha 1 the climate is arid with an annual reference evapotranspiration of 1600 mm and annual rainfall of about 100 mm which mostly occurs during the summer months searles et al 2011 the growing season starts in september early spring and finishes at the end of april late fall for our southern hemisphere location the soil was deep loamy sand 80 sand 15 silt 5 clay with a volumetric soil water content cm3 cm 3 at field capacity of 0 16 and a wilting point of 0 06 the tree canopy was a free vase with an average volume of 38 m3 and no pruning was conducted during the study the trees were fertilized by the grower before the rdi period during the spring and early summer of the first growing season in the second and third growing seasons each tree received 500 g n 90 g p as p2o5 and 400 g k as k2o prior to rdi application based on foliar nutrient analysis 2 2 irrigation treatments and experimental design after the fruit was harvested at mid summer february 15 for green table olive processing a fully irrigated control 100 etc and three regulated deficit irrigation treatments t66 66 etc t33 33 etc t0 0 etc were applied for 75 days from mid february to early may in three consecutive seasons 2008 09 2009 10 2010 11 in order to implement the different irrigation levels two drip irrigation lines per row with 8 emitters per tree were used the drip lines were spaced approximately 1 m apart i e 0 5 m on each side of the tree trunk and the drip emitters were installed continuously at 1 m distances along the drip lines the emitter discharge rate was 6 4 and 2 l h 1 for the control t66 and t33 respectively for t0 the drip lines had no emitters and no irrigation was applied during the experimental period the irrigation frequency was 3 4 days per week all trees were irrigated with 100 etc using 2 l h 1 drip emitters during the rest of the year the irrigation requirements were calculated every two weeks using the standard fao56 formula for crop evapotranspiration etc eto kc kr where eto is the reference evapotranspiration estimated using the penman monteith equation over grass allen et al 1998 kc is the crop coefficient and kr is the coefficient of reduction associated with percentage crop cover fereres et al 1981 climate data for determining eto were taken from an automatic weather station davis instruments ca usa located in a large cleared area with bare soil 1 km from the experiment values of et over bare soil were adjusted to reference conditions over grass using annex 6 of allen et al 1998 a crop coefficient kc of 0 7 was used during the spring through the fall months to estimate 100 etc based on a previous study in the same orchard correa tedesco et al 2010 and a kc of 0 4 was applied during the winter rousseaux et al 2008 2009 the kr was 0 76 0 82 and 0 90 in the first second and third growing seasons respectively the experimental design was a randomized complete block design with five blocks each block contained one plot of each irrigation level for a total of 20 plots i e 5 blocks 4 irrigation levels a plot consisted of seven consecutive trees in the same row and most measurements were performed on the central four trees non experimental trees were watered with 33 etc to avoid lateral water movement between rows further details can be found in agüero alcaras et al 2016 2 3 soil moisture and stem water potential the soil moisture and stem water potential were determined once prior to initiating the rdi treatments every 15 days during the experimental period and once after full irrigation 100 etc was restored one soil core per plot was taken near a drip emitter to a depth of 1 25 m using an edelman type auger eijkelkamp agrisearch equipment em giesbeek the netherlands the soil samples were weighed in the laboratory and then dried in an oven to obtain soil water content the relative extractable water rew was calculated using the formula rew r rmin rmax rmin where r is the current soil water content rmin is the lowest measured soil water content during the experiment and rmax is the soil water content at field capacity fernández et al 1997 gómez del campo and fernández 2007 the stem water potential ψs was measured at midday under clear sky conditions on one shoot per plot located near the main trunk inside the tree canopy with a pressure chamber bio control model 0 8 mpa buenos aires arg the shoots were covered with polyethylene bags and aluminum foil an hour before the measurements water stress was calculated as the average ψs during the entire 75 d rdi period and as the water stress integral sψ mpa day using the formula sψ ψs c n proposed by myers 1988 in this formula ψs is the average stem water potential between measurement dates c is the maximum ψs during the season and n is the number of days between measurement dates further details can be found in agüero alcaras et al 2016 2 4 flowering and fruit set return flowering and fruit set were evaluated in the spring of the 2009 10 and 2010 11 growing seasons following the first and second post harvest rdi applications but not after the third application flowering density at full bloom m 3 mid october was determined as the number of inflorescences inside a known cubic volume 0 2 m x 0 2 m x 0 2 m at 2 m canopy height for each of the four main azimuth directions in the central four trees of each plot four one year old shoots per tree were removed from the same central trees in order to count the number of perfect and imperfect flowers on each inflorescence using a magnifying glass 10x and to determine the total number of flowers per inflorescence perfect flowers are hermaphroditic with both stamens and a bilocular ovary while imperfect flowers have stamens and an aborted pistil the number of inflorescences per shoot was simultaneously counted on four similar marked shoots per tree and fruit number was counted 45 days later fruit set was then calculated as fruit number divided by flower number per shoot and multiplied by 100 2 5 fruit number size and yield all fruits were harvested manually from each tree in mid february of each season as is common in the region the first harvest occurred in 2009 approximately one week before the first rdi application and the potential effects of the rdi applications were evaluated in the following three harvests february 2010 2011 and 2012 the fresh fruit yield of each tree was weighed in the field with a digital scale shortly after harvesting fruit number per tree was estimated by dividing the yield of each tree by the fresh weight of 100 fruit from the same tree these 100 fruits were then dried in an oven bio control buenos aires arg at 80 c until constant weight was reached to obtain fruit dry weight subsequently the fruit water content was calculated using the fruit fresh and dry weights fruit equatorial and longitudinal diameters were determined with a digital caliber with an additional sample of 20 fruit this sample was also used for obtaining the fresh weight pulp pit ratio the pulp was removed from each pit with a knife and the pulp and pits were weighed separately crop water productivity kg m 3 was calculated as the fresh fruit yield of each tree divided by annual irrigation plus effective rainfall events over 7 mm for crop water productivity the 12 months prior to a given harvest march through february were considered to be the most appropriate period for calculating annual irrigation plus rainfall because they included both the previous rdi application period and the subsequent months before harvest effective rainfall was less than 50 mm annually during the experimental period 2 6 shoot and trunk growth current year shoot length and trunk circumference were measured near the beginning of the growing season september and at the beginning and end of the rdi application in the growing seasons in which rdi was applied 2008 09 2009 10 2010 11 eight shoots per tree with an initial length of about 5 0 cm were marked each season and shoot elongation was calculated as the growth cm between measurement dates trunk circumference was measured at a height of 30 cm above ground level using a flexible tape measure and trunk area growth cm2 was calculated from the circumference data 2 7 statistical analysis one way analysis of variance anova was performed for each season to evaluate the response to post harvest rdi in most variables using infostat software university of córdoba córdoba argentina tukey s test was employed to separate significant differences between means p 0 05 inflorescence number was analyzed with a two way anova because preliminary assessment indicated a possible interaction between treatment and season linear regressions were also performed between sψ and yield related variables to determine if flowering fruit set and other variables were related to water stress during the previous rdi period 3 results 3 1 meteorological data and irrigation maximum daily temperatures decreased from approximately 32 c to 27 c during the post harvest rdi periods and the minimum daily temperatures fell from about 18 14 c fig 1a the average daily eto was 4 3 mm and decreased from daily values around 5 5 mm at the beginning of the rdi period to 2 5 mm near the end fig 1b the total eto was slightly above 300 mm during each of the rdi periods table 1 with irrigation in the control 100 etc increasing from 178 mm in the first rdi season to 208 mm in the third rdi season due to increasing tree size the t66 irrigation treatment received a maximum of 139 mm of irrigation in the third rdi season and t33 received 69 mm that same season the t0 did not receive any irrigation during rdi and effective rainfall events over 7 mm was minimal with a total of 10 16 and 26 mm in the three rdi periods the reduction in annual irrigation was approximately 6 13 and 19 in the t66 t33 and t0 treatments respectively in each season 3 2 soil moisture and stem water potential the different irrigation levels showed a considerable range of average soil rew values during the post harvest rdi period in each of the three seasons when rdi was applied table 2 the averages of soil rew of the control and t66 were not statistically different in any of the seasons but soil rew in t0 was lower than that of the control and t66 in all seasons the soil rew of the t0 treatment was also lower than that of t33 in the last rdi period similarly to soil rew the average values of ψs were not statistically different between the control and t66 in the first two rdi periods when ψs was measured the average ψs of t0 was much lower than those of the control and t66 with t33 tending to have intermediate ψs the sψ showed similar differences between treatments table 2 3 3 flowering and fruit set the inflorescence density m 3 of tree canopy in the spring following the first and second rdi periods showed a significant interaction between irrigation treatment and season p 0 01 fig 2 the number of inflorescences tended to be greater in t0 after the first rdi application than in the control t66 and t33 in contrast inflorescence density was somewhat lower in t0 relative to the control and other rdi treatments after the second rdi season even though inflorescence density in t0 remained fairly constant between seasons inflorescence density was not evaluated after the third rdi application no significant differences in perfect imperfect and total flower number per inflorescence between the control and the rdi treatments were observed table 3 fruit set was slightly lower in t0 compared to the control in the spring following the first rdi application p 0 05 but no difference was apparent after the second rdi application in contrast fruit set in t66 was lower than the other irrigation levels after the second season 3 4 fruit number size and yield as expected there were no differences in fruit number per tree and fresh fruit yield at harvest in february 2009 prior to the application of rdi fig 3a and b the season following the first rdi application fruit number and yield were significantly greater in t0 p 0 05 than in the control and other rdi treatments following the second and third rdi applications no statistically significant differences in fruit number and yield were found between any of the irrigation levels as is typical of mature olive trees alternate bearing between seasons was displayed with high yields occurring in 2008 09 and 2010 11 and low yields occurring in 2009 10 and 2011 12 fig 3b after three seasons of applying post harvest rdi cumulative total yield was not statistically decreased fig 4 on a percentage basis total yield was 92 86 and 95 of the control in the t66 t33 and t0 rdi treatments respectively individual fruit weight pulp pit ratio and fruit water content were not affected by the rdi treatments table 4 individual fruit weight across all irrigation levels was lower in 2010 11 than the other two seasons evaluated because it was a season with high fruit load 3 5 relationships between water stress integral and yield variables following the first rdi application 2009 10 inflorescence density fig 5a in the spring was positively related to sψ r2 0 28 p 0 02 while fruit set fig 5b tended to decrease with sψ r2 0 18 p 0 06 similar to inflorescence density fruit number per tree and fruit yield at harvest after the first rdi application were positively related to sψ fig 5c and d no significant relationships were obtained following the second rdi application for any of the measured variables data not shown 3 6 crop water productivity in the season following the first post harvest rdi application 2009 10 water productivity was significantly greater in t0 than in the control and other rdi treatments fig 6 following the second rdi application water productivity was greater in t0 than the control with t66 and t33 having intermediate values no difference in water productivity was observed between the irrigation levels after the third rdi period 3 7 shoot and trunk growth as expected no differences in shoot elongation and trunk cross sectional area increase were apparent between the control and rdi treatments before the first application of post harvest rdi in 2008 09 table 5 during the first rdi period shoot elongation was low 1 cm in all irrigation levels and there were no significant differences were detected between treatments trunk cross sectional area increase was similar between the control and t66 during rdi application the first season while t0 showed a contraction in trunk cross sectional area and t33 displayed intermediate values similar results were obtained in the second season in the third season shoot elongation was slightly less in t66 than in the other irrigation levels before rdi and shoot elongation decreased with decreasing irrigation level during rdi although little elongation occurred in any of the irrigation levels lastly the responses of trunk cross sectional area in the third season were similar to those of the first two seasons 4 discussion irrigation management is a challenge in new olive growing regions such as northwestern argentina torres et al 2017 and requires knowledge of the specific responses of olive trees to water stress throughout the growing season fernández 2014 fernández et al 2018 one of the most critical variables to consider for applying post harvest rdi in early harvested table olive cultivars in dry climates is the return flowering flowering showed a significant interaction between the rdi treatments and growing season in this study fig 2 the spring following the first application of rdi flowering was 39 greater in t0 than in the control while it was 19 lower following the second application similar to our results that were obtained with an average midday ψs of about 3 mpa the inflorescence number per fertile branch was 46 higher than the control in the spring after one season of summer rdi with water deficit ψleaf 4 mpa in the cv leccino gucci et al 2007 furthermore the return flowering was five times greater in cv arbequina trees after two seasons of sustained deficit irrigation with ψs reaching 3 to 4 mpa in the fall grattan et al 2006 on the other hand other studies have reported that similar water stress levels the previous season did not result in changes in return flowering gucci et al 2019 hueso et al 2019 the only previous post harvest rdi study in olive did not observe any changes in flowering but water potential values were not reported grijalva contreras et al 2013 in other fruit species such as loquat and peach several studies have shown that severe water stress can improve return flowering over several seasons larson et al 1988 johnson et al 1992 cuevas et al 2012 the t0 treatment in the present study may not of had greater flowering 19 after the second post harvest rdi application due to the greater fruit number and yield than in the other irrigation treatments the previous season fernández et al 2015 of course it cannot be discounted that the greater sψ during the second rdi application 139 mpa day compared to the first application 107 mpa day affected the return flowering response of t0 for olive trees to flower during the spring the accumulation of a sufficient number of chilling hours during the fall and winter is needed rallo et al 1994 recent molecular evidence suggests that encoding genes of the flowering locus t are expressed in olive under cold conditions and that this expression leads to floral induction haberman et al 2017 given that the same or similar genes can be expressed with water stress in arabidopsis reviewed by takeno 2016 and fruit trees such as lemon li et al 2017 it may be that return flowering in olive trees after post harvest water stress is also controlled by genes encoding for the flowering locus t this could explain the greater flowering in t0 after the first season further studies should be carried out to explore this possibility fruit set in olive trees depends on both flower number and quality as well as water management and climate conditions lavee et al 1996 1999 rapoport et al 2012 rapoport 2014 in our study fruit set expressed as the number of fruit per flower number on shoots positioned in the exterior part of the canopy decreased significantly from 2 4 in the well watered control to 1 5 in the t0 treatment in the spring following the first rdi application table 3 given that flowering can represent up to 20 of annual biomass production in olive trees famiani et al 2019 the greater inflorescence density in the t0 treatment than in the control for that spring may have led to greater competition for photoassimilates between developing fruit in externally positioned shoots where inflorescence density is highest in olive trees such competition has previously been shown to lead to fruit abortion in various olive cultivars lavee et al 1999 and likely decreased fruit set in these shoots in the t0 treatment at the whole tree level fruit number was still 31 greater in t0 than the control fig 3 this confirms the importance of the observed increase in inflorescence density after the first rdi application and demonstrates in the case of fruit set that the responses of individual shoot measurements in the exterior of the canopy may not always be strictly associated with whole tree responses as proposed by cherbiy hoffmann et al 2013 the only previous post harvest rdi study in olive also found a decrease in fruit set in measured shoots the following spring although it was accompanied by a significant reduction in yield per tree grijalva contreras et al 2013 in other fruit trees decreases increases and no effects have been reported for fruit set due to post harvest rdi larson et al 1988 johnson et al 1994 ruiz sanchez et al 1999 naor et al 2005 blanco et al 2020 it is likely that the timing and severity of the rdi applied as well as the floral biology of a given species substantially influence fruit set response for commercial purposes fruit size and fruit yield per hectare are critical parameters for table olive cultivars individual fruit weight was not affected by post harvest rdi in any of the three seasons evaluated table 4 however the combination of greater fruit number and equivalent fruit weight led to an increase in fruit yield the season following the first rdi application in the t0 treatment fig 3 and both fruit number and yield increased linearly with the sψ applied during the first rdi period fig 5c d on the other hand the cumulative fruit yield after three seasons of post harvest rdi in this mature orchard did not show any statistically significant differences between the well watered control and the rdi treatments fig 4 on a percentage basis the cumulative yield in the well watered control trees tended to be slightly greater than the yield of the rdi treatments 5 14 only a few rdi studies have been previously conducted in table olive cultivars at different phenological stages regulated deficit irrigation applied after pit hardening in the summer found that irrigation with 50 etc for two months led to moderate water stress but did not affect yield over four seasons and saved 25 of annual irrigation water in cv manzanilla goldhamer 1999 a similar rdi study during pit hardening also observed that a moderate water deficit did not decrease yield and processed green olives that received the rdi were preferred by a consumer panel due to better taste and crunchiness cano lamadrid et al 2015 nevertheless the previous post harvest rdi study mentioned earlier from mexico did report a 30 decrease in yield after one season of rdi application optimally longer studies at different locations would provide needed information to best assess the responses of olive trees to post harvest rdi long term studies in some other fruit trees have shown that post harvest rdi can be used for 6 10 growing seasons without important yield reductions including citrus ballester et al 2014 loquat hueso and cuevas 2010 plum blanco cipollone et al 2019 and peach wang et al 2020 however the possibility of detrimental effects should be carefully monitored intrigliolo et al 2013 orchard characteristics such as canopy volume soil depth and root distribution are likely to be relevant for the adaptation of given orchards to long term post harvest rdi in dry regions where fruit trees are often cultivated it is necessary to consider water productivity as well as fruit yield fereres et al 2014 crop water productivity expressed as kg of fresh fruit per the annual amount of irrigation applied plus rainfall is a useful term because it allows for ready comparisons between studies fernández et al 2020 under post harvest rdi in our study it was found that the t0 rdi treatment had greater crop water productivity than the other rdi treatments and the control in the first two seasons after rdi but not after the third rdi application when fruit yield was low in all trees fig 6 water productivity often increases with deficit irrigation in olive orchards in mediterranean climates when expressed based on the amount of irrigation provided fernández 2014 but this is not necessarily the case when rainfall is included in the calculations fernández et al 2020 interestingly the crop water productivity values in our study in an on year 2 4 2 8 kg m 3 in a mature cv manzanilla orchard with a fairly low planting density 312 trees ha 1 were similar to values from super high density orchards cv arbequina 1000 trees ha 1 in southern spain hueso et al 2019 fernández et al 2020 however alternate bearing was high in our study and water productivity was more than 50 reduced in off years it may be that irrigation could be reduced in off years not just in post harvest but in other phenological stages as well to decrease alternate bearing and to consequently increase water productivity post harvest rdi has long been used to control vegetative growth in early harvested cultivars of many fruit tree species larson et al 1988 conejero et al 2011 de la rosa et al 2016 blanco et al 2020 in the current study little olive shoot growth occurred during the post harvest rdi period from mid summer into the fall 2 cm although rdi did tend to decrease shoot elongation during the periods of application table 5 most of the shoot growth occurred in the spring and early summer when all the trees were irrigated with 100 etc this likely contributed to cumulative yield being unaffected over the three seasons other studies from the same region and the mediterranean basin have also reported that shoot growth in autumn is much lower than in the spring correa tedesco et al 2010 fernández et al 2015 girón et al 2015 in contrast to shoot growth trunk growth was substantial in post harvest and was sensitive to post harvest rdi for this reason a related study in the same orchard recommended that trunk growth rate may be a good candidate for post harvest irrigation management agüero alcaras et al 2016 5 conclusion the results indicate alternative irrigation strategies that adapt to regional climatic conditions are feasible in non mediterranean climates after three growing seasons post harvest rdi during the summer and fall led to an annual water savings of almost 20 in a mature cv manzanilla orchard without significant reductions in yield of green table olives the possibility of combining irrigation deficit in post harvest with deficit in other phenological stages should be explored this may be especially relevant for growing seasons in which fruit load is low and vegetative growth is potentially excessive further studies with post harvest rdi are also needed over a greater number of seasons

10268,olive trees are harvested in late summer or during the fall in the mediterranean basin with considerable rainfall often occurring after harvest which largely eliminates the need to irrigate at that time as olive cultivation has expanded to new regions it has become necessary to develop new water management strategies to account for non mediterranean climate conditions in northwestern argentina olive cultivars are harvested as early as mid summer for green table olive processing but rainfall is low and temperatures remain high after harvest thus we evaluated the responses of yield determinants and components crop water productivity and vegetative growth of olive trees cv manzanilla fina to different post harvest irrigation levels in three growing seasons a fully irrigated control 100 crop evapotranspiration etc and three regulated deficit irrigation treatments rdi t66 66 etc t33 33 etc t0 0 etc were applied for 75 days after harvest from mid summer to mid fall the rdi treatments received irrigation equivalent to the control during the rest of the year the return flowering in the spring after the first season of rdi tended to be greater in t0 than in the well watered control and other rdi treatments despite some decrease in fruit set this led to a significant increase in fruit number and yield in t0 compared to the control and the other rdi treatments in contrast flowering tended to be lower in t0 than in the irrigated control t66 and t33 following the second season of rdi but fruit number and yield were not different at harvest similarly no differences in fruit number and yield were observed after the third rdi season cumulative total yield over the three seasons was not significantly affected by applying post harvest rdi crop water productivity expressed as fruit yield per amount of annual irrigation plus effective rainfall was significantly higher in t0 than in the control after the first and second seasons of rdi shoot growth during the rdi period was very low and only reduced significantly during the third rdi period the results suggest that alternative irrigation strategies that adapt to regional climatic conditions should be further developed in non mediterranean climates water savings up to 20 per year appear feasible with post harvest rdi in northwestern argentina without significant losses in yield keywords flowering fruit number olea europaea shoot growth table olives 1 introduction competition between different sectors for water is a global phenomenon with crop irrigation accounting for approximately

low in many parts of northwestern argentina the expansion of perennial crops such as olive and grape into previously uncultivated areas over the last 30 years has led to crop irrigation using at least 90 of fresh water extraction ayerza and sibbett 2001 gómez del campo et al 2010 searles et al 2011 torres et al 2017 furthermore much of the irrigation water is deep groundwater due to the scarcity of

depending on crop load climate and crop management connor and fereres 2005 in northwestern argentina a pronounced growth peak most often occurs early in the season and a secondary peak may occur after harvest in late summer or autumn fernández et al 2015 flowering also occurs in the spring and flowering intensity depends on several factors including the number of buds formed on shoot growth from the previous season and the accumulation of chilling hours during the fall and winter lavee 1996 aybar et al 2015 haberman et al 2017 fruit number is strongly determined by flowering intensity although flower quality and the percentage of fruit set should also be considered rapoport 2014 a given growing season is termed to be an on year when fruit number is high and is often followed by a growing season with little fruit load called an off year lavee 2007 smith and samach 2013 olive harvest occurs in the late summer or fall in the mediterranean basin cano lamadrid et al 2015 rallo and cuevas 2017 however table olive cultivars are harvested at the green yellowish maturity stage for brine processing as early as mid summer in northwestern argentina due to the warm temperatures in the region that lead to early flowering and fruit growth correa tedesco et al 2010 searles et al 2011 supplementary irrigation of olive trees increases vegetative growth and fruit yield in areas of low rainfall moriana et al 2003 fernandes silva et al 2010 cajias et al 2016 on the other hand numerous studies have found that sustainable moderate yields can be generated in commercial olive orchards without the need to irrigate with 100 of crop evapotranspiration etc reviewed by connor and fereres 2005 fernández 2014 sustained deficit irrigation sdi which consists of applying less than 100 etc throughout the growing season somewhat reduces yield and vegetative growth but the water savings are considerable and the lower vegetative growth can be beneficial in mature orchards by controlling canopy size and potentially reducing pruning frequency goldhamer et al 1993 girona et al 2002 iniesta et al 2009 corell et al 2019 in northwestern argentina correa tedesco et al 2010 observed that the application of only 66 etc over the entire growing season in a table olive cultivar cv manzanilla fina led to mild water stress which decreased fruit yield by 25 and shoot growth by 50 compared to a well watered control along with the water savings irrigation water productivity expressed as fruit yield per mm of irrigation applied increased by 60 another strategy in fruit trees is regulated deficit irrigation rdi in which less than 100 etc is applied in one or more specific phenological stages that are likely to be fairly insensitive to water deficit reviewed by naor 2006 pérez pastor et al 2016 regulated deficit irrigation has been applied successfully during the pit hardening phase and the beginning of the oil accumulation phase in olive oil cultivars in the summer in the mediterranean basin e g tognetti et al 2006 lavee et al 2007 gómez del campo 2013a 2013b gucci et al 2019 although rdi in these stages can somewhat decrease oil yield approx 20 if irrigation is markedly reduced 50 etc water savings are considerable because evapotranspiration is very high in the summer post harvest rdi is applied after harvest when crop water demand may still be high in many fruit trees and its effects on vegetative growth for the remainder of the growing season and on flowering and yield the following growing season are determined it has often been used without yield reductions in several fruit tree species including loquat hueso and cuevas 2010 cuevas et al 2012 cherry blanco et al 2019 2020 carrasco benavides et al 2020 nectarine de la rosa et al 2016 and peach larson et al 1988 johnson et al 1992 wang et al 2020 girón et al 2015 noted that post harvest rdi has been little explored in olive trees a moderate post harvest rdi 50 etc for three months after an early table olive harvest in the sonora desert of mexico did not affect vegetative growth or return flowering but fruit set and yield were decreased the following season grijalva contreras et al 2013 further studies over more seasons are currently needed to better assess potential post harvest rdi yield responses in olive irrigation is normally applied the entire year in olive orchards in northwestern argentina because rainfall is very scarce and is concentrated in the summer months as heavy downpours gómez del campo et al 2010 searles et al 2011 torres et al 2017 thus irrigation strategies likely should be different from those of the mediterranean basin where most irrigation occurs in the fall and winter as an example suspension of irrigation for six weeks during the winter in northwestern argentina led to a mild water stress and did not show a significant reduction in the fruit yield the following season rousseaux et al 2008 but longer periods of irrigation suspension or deficit irrigation in winter and early spring did lower fruit and oil yield pierantozzi et al 2014 a crop coefficient of 0 4 was calculated for the winter months when rainfall is rare and 0 7 for the remainder of the year in northwestern argentina based on sap flow measurements rousseaux et al 2009 the objective of the current study was to evaluate the responses of yield determinants and components crop water productivity and vegetative growth of olive trees cv manzanilla fina to different post harvest irrigation levels in three growing seasons because rainfall can be scarce during this period mid summer and fall an evaluation of several plant indicators and soil moisture content to post harvest rdi in the same experiment found that irrigation equivalent to 33 etc or no irrigation was necessary to reduce midday stem water potential in northwest argentina agüero alcaras et al 2016 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site post harvest rdi was applied during three growing seasons 2008 09 2009 10 2010 11 in a commercial olive orchard located 15 km east of aimogasta la rioja in northwest argentina lat 28 35 s long 66 42 w 790 m above mean sea level the trees olea europaea l cv manzanilla fina were 10 years old at the start of the experiment row orientation was north south with a tree spacing of 4 m within the row and 8 m between rows 312 trees ha 1 the climate is arid with an annual reference evapotranspiration of 1600 mm and annual rainfall of about 100 mm which mostly occurs during the summer months searles et al 2011 the growing season starts in september early spring and finishes at the end of april late fall for our southern hemisphere location the soil was deep loamy sand 80 sand 15 silt 5 clay with a volumetric soil water content cm3 cm 3 at field capacity of 0 16 and a wilting point of 0 06 the tree canopy was a free vase with an average volume of 38 m3 and no pruning was conducted during the study the trees were fertilized by the grower before the rdi period during the spring and early summer of the first growing season in the second and third growing seasons each tree received 500 g n 90 g p as p2o5 and 400 g k as k2o prior to rdi application based on foliar nutrient analysis 2 2 irrigation treatments and experimental design after the fruit was harvested at mid summer february 15 for green table olive processing a fully irrigated control 100 etc and three regulated deficit irrigation treatments t66 66 etc t33 33 etc t0 0 etc were applied for 75 days from mid february to early may in three consecutive seasons 2008 09 2009 10 2010 11 in order to implement the different irrigation levels two drip irrigation lines per row with 8 emitters per tree were used the drip lines were spaced approximately 1 m apart i e 0 5 m on each side of the tree trunk and the drip emitters were installed continuously at 1 m distances along the drip lines the emitter discharge rate was 6 4 and 2 l h 1 for the control t66 and t33 respectively for t0 the drip lines had no emitters and no irrigation was applied during the experimental period the irrigation frequency was 3 4 days per week all trees were irrigated with 100 etc using 2 l h 1 drip emitters during the rest of the year the irrigation requirements were calculated every two weeks using the standard fao56 formula for crop evapotranspiration etc eto kc kr where eto is the reference evapotranspiration estimated using the penman monteith equation over grass allen et al 1998 kc is the crop coefficient and kr is the coefficient of reduction associated with percentage crop cover fereres et al 1981 climate data for determining eto were taken from an automatic weather station davis instruments ca usa located in a large cleared area with bare soil 1 km from the experiment values of et over bare soil were adjusted to reference conditions over grass using annex 6 of allen et al 1998 a crop coefficient kc of 0 7 was used during the spring through the fall months to estimate 100 etc based on a previous study in the same orchard correa tedesco et al 2010 and a kc of 0 4 was applied during the winter rousseaux et al 2008 2009 the kr was 0 76 0 82 and 0 90 in the first second and third growing seasons respectively the experimental design was a randomized complete block design with five blocks each block contained one plot of each irrigation level for a total of 20 plots i e 5 blocks 4 irrigation levels a plot consisted of seven consecutive trees in the same row and most measurements were performed on the central four trees non experimental trees were watered with 33 etc to avoid lateral water movement between rows further details can be found in agüero alcaras et al 2016 2 3 soil moisture and stem water potential the soil moisture and stem water potential were determined once prior to initiating the rdi treatments every 15 days during the experimental period and once after full irrigation 100 etc was restored one soil core per plot was taken near a drip emitter to a depth of 1 25 m using an edelman type auger eijkelkamp agrisearch equipment em giesbeek the netherlands the soil samples were weighed in the laboratory and then dried in an oven to obtain soil water content the relative extractable water rew was calculated using the formula rew r rmin rmax rmin where r is the current soil water content rmin is the lowest measured soil water content during the experiment and rmax is the soil water content at field capacity fernández et al 1997 gómez del campo and fernández 2007 the stem water potential ψs was measured at midday under clear sky conditions on one shoot per plot located near the main trunk inside the tree canopy with a pressure chamber bio control model 0 8 mpa buenos aires arg the shoots were covered with polyethylene bags and aluminum foil an hour before the measurements water stress was calculated as the average ψs during the entire 75 d rdi period and as the water stress integral sψ mpa day using the formula sψ ψs c n proposed by myers 1988 in this formula ψs is the average stem water potential between measurement dates c is the maximum ψs during the season and n is the number of days between measurement dates further details can be found in agüero alcaras et al 2016 2 4 flowering and fruit set return flowering and fruit set were evaluated in the spring of the 2009 10 and 2010 11 growing seasons following the first and second post harvest rdi applications but not after the third application flowering density at full bloom m 3 mid october was determined as the number of inflorescences inside a known cubic volume 0 2 m x 0 2 m x 0 2 m at 2 m canopy height for each of the four main azimuth directions in the central four trees of each plot four one year old shoots per tree were removed from the same central trees in order to count the number of perfect and imperfect flowers on each inflorescence using a magnifying glass 10x and to determine the total number of flowers per inflorescence perfect flowers are hermaphroditic with both stamens and a bilocular ovary while imperfect flowers have stamens and an aborted pistil the number of inflorescences per shoot was simultaneously counted on four similar marked shoots per tree and fruit number was counted 45 days later fruit set was then calculated as fruit number divided by flower number per shoot and multiplied by 100 2 5 fruit number size and yield all fruits were harvested manually from each tree in mid february of each season as is common in the region the first harvest occurred in 2009 approximately one week before the first rdi application and the potential effects of the rdi applications were evaluated in the following three harvests february 2010 2011 and 2012 the fresh fruit yield of each tree was weighed in the field with a digital scale shortly after harvesting fruit number per tree was estimated by dividing the yield of each tree by the fresh weight of 100 fruit from the same tree these 100 fruits were then dried in an oven bio control buenos aires arg at 80 c until constant weight was reached to obtain fruit dry weight subsequently the fruit water content was calculated using the fruit fresh and dry weights fruit equatorial and longitudinal diameters were determined with a digital caliber with an additional sample of 20 fruit this sample was also used for obtaining the fresh weight pulp pit ratio the pulp was removed from each pit with a knife and the pulp and pits were weighed separately crop water productivity kg m 3 was calculated as the fresh fruit yield of each tree divided by annual irrigation plus effective rainfall events over 7 mm for crop water productivity the 12 months prior to a given harvest march through february were considered to be the most appropriate period for calculating annual irrigation plus rainfall because they included both the previous rdi application period and the subsequent months before harvest effective rainfall was less than 50 mm annually during the experimental period 2 6 shoot and trunk growth current year shoot length and trunk circumference were measured near the beginning of the growing season september and at the beginning and end of the rdi application in the growing seasons in which rdi was applied 2008 09 2009 10 2010 11 eight shoots per tree with an initial length of about 5 0 cm were marked each season and shoot elongation was calculated as the growth cm between measurement dates trunk circumference was measured at a height of 30 cm above ground level using a flexible tape measure and trunk area growth cm2 was calculated from the circumference data 2 7 statistical analysis one way analysis of variance anova was performed for each season to evaluate the response to post harvest rdi in most variables using infostat software university of córdoba córdoba argentina tukey s test was employed to separate significant differences between means p 0 05 inflorescence number was analyzed with a two way anova because preliminary assessment indicated a possible interaction between treatment and season linear regressions were also performed between sψ and yield related variables to determine if flowering fruit set and other variables were related to water stress during the previous rdi period 3 results 3 1 meteorological data and irrigation maximum daily temperatures decreased from approximately 32 c to 27 c during the post harvest rdi periods and the minimum daily temperatures fell from about 18 14 c fig 1a the average daily eto was 4 3 mm and decreased from daily values around 5 5 mm at the beginning of the rdi period to 2 5 mm near the end fig 1b the total eto was slightly above 300 mm during each of the rdi periods table 1 with irrigation in the control 100 etc increasing from 178 mm in the first rdi season to 208 mm in the third rdi season due to increasing tree size the t66 irrigation treatment received a maximum of 139 mm of irrigation in the third rdi season and t33 received 69 mm that same season the t0 did not receive any irrigation during rdi and effective rainfall events over 7 mm was minimal with a total of 10 16 and 26 mm in the three rdi periods the reduction in annual irrigation was approximately 6 13 and 19 in the t66 t33 and t0 treatments respectively in each season 3 2 soil moisture and stem water potential the different irrigation levels showed a considerable range of average soil rew values during the post harvest rdi period in each of the three seasons when rdi was applied table 2 the averages of soil rew of the control and t66 were not statistically different in any of the seasons but soil rew in t0 was lower than that of the control and t66 in all seasons the soil rew of the t0 treatment was also lower than that of t33 in the last rdi period similarly to soil rew the average values of ψs were not statistically different between the control and t66 in the first two rdi periods when ψs was measured the average ψs of t0 was much lower than those of the control and t66 with t33 tending to have intermediate ψs the sψ showed similar differences between treatments table 2 3 3 flowering and fruit set the inflorescence density m 3 of tree canopy in the spring following the first and second rdi periods showed a significant interaction between irrigation treatment and season p 0 01 fig 2 the number of inflorescences tended to be greater in t0 after the first rdi application than in the control t66 and t33 in contrast inflorescence density was somewhat lower in t0 relative to the control and other rdi treatments after the second rdi season even though inflorescence density in t0 remained fairly constant between seasons inflorescence density was not evaluated after the third rdi application no significant differences in perfect imperfect and total flower number per inflorescence between the control and the rdi treatments were observed table 3 fruit set was slightly lower in t0 compared to the control in the spring following the first rdi application p 0 05 but no difference was apparent after the second rdi application in contrast fruit set in t66 was lower than the other irrigation levels after the second season 3 4 fruit number size and yield as expected there were no differences in fruit number per tree and fresh fruit yield at harvest in february 2009 prior to the application of rdi fig 3a and b the season following the first rdi application fruit number and yield were significantly greater in t0 p 0 05 than in the control and other rdi treatments following the second and third rdi applications no statistically significant differences in fruit number and yield were found between any of the irrigation levels as is typical of mature olive trees alternate bearing between seasons was displayed with high yields occurring in 2008 09 and 2010 11 and low yields occurring in 2009 10 and 2011 12 fig 3b after three seasons of applying post harvest rdi cumulative total yield was not statistically decreased fig 4 on a percentage basis total yield was 92 86 and 95 of the control in the t66 t33 and t0 rdi treatments respectively individual fruit weight pulp pit ratio and fruit water content were not affected by the rdi treatments table 4 individual fruit weight across all irrigation levels was lower in 2010 11 than the other two seasons evaluated because it was a season with high fruit load 3 5 relationships between water stress integral and yield variables following the first rdi application 2009 10 inflorescence density fig 5a in the spring was positively related to sψ r2 0 28 p 0 02 while fruit set fig 5b tended to decrease with sψ r2 0 18 p 0 06 similar to inflorescence density fruit number per tree and fruit yield at harvest after the first rdi application were positively related to sψ fig 5c and d no significant relationships were obtained following the second rdi application for any of the measured variables data not shown 3 6 crop water productivity in the season following the first post harvest rdi application 2009 10 water productivity was significantly greater in t0 than in the control and other rdi treatments fig 6 following the second rdi application water productivity was greater in t0 than the control with t66 and t33 having intermediate values no difference in water productivity was observed between the irrigation levels after the third rdi period 3 7 shoot and trunk growth as expected no differences in shoot elongation and trunk cross sectional area increase were apparent between the control and rdi treatments before the first application of post harvest rdi in 2008 09 table 5 during the first rdi period shoot elongation was low 1 cm in all irrigation levels and there were no significant differences were detected between treatments trunk cross sectional area increase was similar between the control and t66 during rdi application the first season while t0 showed a contraction in trunk cross sectional area and t33 displayed intermediate values similar results were obtained in the second season in the third season shoot elongation was slightly less in t66 than in the other irrigation levels before rdi and shoot elongation decreased with decreasing irrigation level during rdi although little elongation occurred in any of the irrigation levels lastly the responses of trunk cross sectional area in the third season were similar to those of the first two seasons 4 discussion irrigation management is a challenge in new olive growing regions such as northwestern argentina torres et al 2017 and requires knowledge of the specific responses of olive trees to water stress throughout the growing season fernández 2014 fernández et al 2018 one of the most critical variables to consider for applying post harvest rdi in early harvested table olive cultivars in dry climates is the return flowering flowering showed a significant interaction between the rdi treatments and growing season in this study fig 2 the spring following the first application of rdi flowering was 39 greater in t0 than in the control while it was 19 lower following the second application similar to our results that were obtained with an average midday ψs of about 3 mpa the inflorescence number per fertile branch was 46 higher than the control in the spring after one season of summer rdi with water deficit ψleaf 4 mpa in the cv leccino gucci et al 2007 furthermore the return flowering was five times greater in cv arbequina trees after two seasons of sustained deficit irrigation with ψs reaching 3 to 4 mpa in the fall grattan et al 2006 on the other hand other studies have reported that similar water stress levels the previous season did not result in changes in return flowering gucci et al 2019 hueso et al 2019 the only previous post harvest rdi study in olive did not observe any changes in flowering but water potential values were not reported grijalva contreras et al 2013 in other fruit species such as loquat and peach several studies have shown that severe water stress can improve return flowering over several seasons larson et al 1988 johnson et al 1992 cuevas et al 2012 the t0 treatment in the present study may not of had greater flowering 19 after the second post harvest rdi application due to the greater fruit number and yield than in the other irrigation treatments the previous season fernández et al 2015 of course it cannot be discounted that the greater sψ during the second rdi application 139 mpa day compared to the first application 107 mpa day affected the return flowering response of t0 for olive trees to flower during the spring the accumulation of a sufficient number of chilling hours during the fall and winter is needed rallo et al 1994 recent molecular evidence suggests that encoding genes of the flowering locus t are expressed in olive under cold conditions and that this expression leads to floral induction haberman et al 2017 given that the same or similar genes can be expressed with water stress in arabidopsis reviewed by takeno 2016 and fruit trees such as lemon li et al 2017 it may be that return flowering in olive trees after post harvest water stress is also controlled by genes encoding for the flowering locus t this could explain the greater flowering in t0 after the first season further studies should be carried out to explore this possibility fruit set in olive trees depends on both flower number and quality as well as water management and climate conditions lavee et al 1996 1999 rapoport et al 2012 rapoport 2014 in our study fruit set expressed as the number of fruit per flower number on shoots positioned in the exterior part of the canopy decreased significantly from 2 4 in the well watered control to 1 5 in the t0 treatment in the spring following the first rdi application table 3 given that flowering can represent up to 20 of annual biomass production in olive trees famiani et al 2019 the greater inflorescence density in the t0 treatment than in the control for that spring may have led to greater competition for photoassimilates between developing fruit in externally positioned shoots where inflorescence density is highest in olive trees such competition has previously been shown to lead to fruit abortion in various olive cultivars lavee et al 1999 and likely decreased fruit set in these shoots in the t0 treatment at the whole tree level fruit number was still 31 greater in t0 than the control fig 3 this confirms the importance of the observed increase in inflorescence density after the first rdi application and demonstrates in the case of fruit set that the responses of individual shoot measurements in the exterior of the canopy may not always be strictly associated with whole tree responses as proposed by cherbiy hoffmann et al 2013 the only previous post harvest rdi study in olive also found a decrease in fruit set in measured shoots the following spring although it was accompanied by a significant reduction in yield per tree grijalva contreras et al 2013 in other fruit trees decreases increases and no effects have been reported for fruit set due to post harvest rdi larson et al 1988 johnson et al 1994 ruiz sanchez et al 1999 naor et al 2005 blanco et al 2020 it is likely that the timing and severity of the rdi applied as well as the floral biology of a given species substantially influence fruit set response for commercial purposes fruit size and fruit yield per hectare are critical parameters for table olive cultivars individual fruit weight was not affected by post harvest rdi in any of the three seasons evaluated table 4 however the combination of greater fruit number and equivalent fruit weight led to an increase in fruit yield the season following the first rdi application in the t0 treatment fig 3 and both fruit number and yield increased linearly with the sψ applied during the first rdi period fig 5c d on the other hand the cumulative fruit yield after three seasons of post harvest rdi in this mature orchard did not show any statistically significant differences between the well watered control and the rdi treatments fig 4 on a percentage basis the cumulative yield in the well watered control trees tended to be slightly greater than the yield of the rdi treatments 5 14 only a few rdi studies have been previously conducted in table olive cultivars at different phenological stages regulated deficit irrigation applied after pit hardening in the summer found that irrigation with 50 etc for two months led to moderate water stress but did not affect yield over four seasons and saved 25 of annual irrigation water in cv manzanilla goldhamer 1999 a similar rdi study during pit hardening also observed that a moderate water deficit did not decrease yield and processed green olives that received the rdi were preferred by a consumer panel due to better taste and crunchiness cano lamadrid et al 2015 nevertheless the previous post harvest rdi study mentioned earlier from mexico did report a 30 decrease in yield after one season of rdi application optimally longer studies at different locations would provide needed information to best assess the responses of olive trees to post harvest rdi long term studies in some other fruit trees have shown that post harvest rdi can be used for 6 10 growing seasons without important yield reductions including citrus ballester et al 2014 loquat hueso and cuevas 2010 plum blanco cipollone et al 2019 and peach wang et al 2020 however the possibility of detrimental effects should be carefully monitored intrigliolo et al 2013 orchard characteristics such as canopy volume soil depth and root distribution are likely to be relevant for the adaptation of given orchards to long term post harvest rdi in dry regions where fruit trees are often cultivated it is necessary to consider water productivity as well as fruit yield fereres et al 2014 crop water productivity expressed as kg of fresh fruit per the annual amount of irrigation applied plus rainfall is a useful term because it allows for ready comparisons between studies fernández et al 2020 under post harvest rdi in our study it was found that the t0 rdi treatment had greater crop water productivity than the other rdi treatments and the control in the first two seasons after rdi but not after the third rdi application when fruit yield was low in all trees fig 6 water productivity often increases with deficit irrigation in olive orchards in mediterranean climates when expressed based on the amount of irrigation provided fernández 2014 but this is not necessarily the case when rainfall is included in the calculations fernández et al 2020 interestingly the crop water productivity values in our study in an on year 2 4 2 8 kg m 3 in a mature cv manzanilla orchard with a fairly low planting density 312 trees ha 1 were similar to values from super high density orchards cv arbequina 1000 trees ha 1 in southern spain hueso et al 2019 fernández et al 2020 however alternate bearing was high in our study and water productivity was more than 50 reduced in off years it may be that irrigation could be reduced in off years not just in post harvest but in other phenological stages as well to decrease alternate bearing and to consequently increase water productivity post harvest rdi has long been used to control vegetative growth in early harvested cultivars of many fruit tree species larson et al 1988 conejero et al 2011 de la rosa et al 2016 blanco et al 2020 in the current study little olive shoot growth occurred during the post harvest rdi period from mid summer into the fall 2 cm although rdi did tend to decrease shoot elongation during the periods of application table 5 most of the shoot growth occurred in the spring and early summer when all the trees were irrigated with 100 etc this likely contributed to cumulative yield being unaffected over the three seasons other studies from the same region and the mediterranean basin have also reported that shoot growth in autumn is much lower than in the spring correa tedesco et al 2010 fernández et al 2015 girón et al 2015 in contrast to shoot growth trunk growth was substantial in post harvest and was sensitive to post harvest rdi for this reason a related study in the same orchard recommended that trunk growth rate may be a good candidate for post harvest irrigation management agüero alcaras et al 2016 5 conclusion the results indicate alternative irrigation strategies that adapt to regional climatic conditions are feasible in non mediterranean climates after three growing seasons post harvest rdi during the summer and fall led to an annual water savings of almost 20 in a mature cv manzanilla orchard without significant reductions in yield of green table olives the possibility of combining irrigation deficit in post harvest with deficit in other phenological stages should be explored this may be especially relevant for growing seasons in which fruit load is low and vegetative growth is potentially excessive further studies with post harvest rdi are also needed over a greater number of seasons

10269,drought occurring at the reproductive stage is the most critical phase affecting cowpea production it remains unclear whether drought priming at the early growth stage can be employed to alleviate drought stress during the post anthesis drought period and improve water productivity wp in cowpea therefore the physiological responses and wp as affected by drought priming were investigated two cowpea varieties tolerant v1 and sensitive v2 to drought stress were submitted to drought priming followed by water recovery and then subjected to subsequent drought stresses 80 60 and 40 of soil water holding capacity swhc the results showed that cowpea pre exposed to drought priming acquired a stress imprint that alleviated the subsequent drought stress which occurred during the later growth stage as exemplified by the improvement of water status photosynthesis water productivity of biomass wpb and yield wpy as well as the modulation of plant hormones under the drought stress during the post anthesis period primed plants maintained lower aba leaf and higher iaa leaf than plants without priming due to better plant water status for drought primed plants the results revealed that drought priming could modulate against aba leaf increase under drought as elevated aba leaf was the main reason for stomatal limitation thereby decreasing photosynthesis and leading to great yield loss primed plants consumed 32 and 24 less water for v1 and v2 respectively which significantly increased wp while decreased intrinsic water use efficiency wuei of drought primed plants it is suggested that drought priming during the early growth period can be used as a promising strategy to save water use for irrigation while improving wp of crops in the regions where water is scarce keywords irrigation plant hormone stomata conductance water use efficiency water stress 1 introduction drought is a critical factor perturbing metabolism development and biomass production of plants in the world daryanto et al 2017 in future climate scenarios drought frequency and severity coupled with rising temperature are expected to increase cook et al 2014 particularly for cowpea production in the water scarce regions where drought is the utmost constraint leading to great yield loss cowpea is a major crop species with superior nutritional attributes cultivated in africa and many developing countries however drought occurring during different growth stages can reduce division and expansion of cells leading to growth retardation and dramatic yield losses fatokun et al 2012 drought at the reproductive stage can dramatically reduce cowpea s productivity hamidou et al 2007 this is due to the reduction in the duration of the reproductive stage and branch number resulting in reduction of pod number and seed weight and it was found that drought applied five weeks after sowing caused flower abortion and dramatically decreased grain yield by 67 fatokun et al 2012 a similar reduction in grain yield and fodder by 65 and 40 respectively was observed under post flowering drought stress in cowpea growing in the field belko et al 2014 in addition drought applied during vegetative and flowering periods has also been found to reduce leaf area and affect grain quality hamidou et al 2007 drought stress decreases photosynthesis stomatal conductance transpiration and

3 1 soil water dynamics under drought priming the average soil water content reduced from 24 to 10 in primed plants whereas for non primed plants the average soil water content was kept at around 24 for both varieties fig 2 after 6 day recovery similar soil water contents at around 23 were observed for plants with and without priming during the subsequent stresses soil water contents for v1 of primed plants remained at around 13 18 and 22 respectively whereas for the non primed plants they were kept at around 12 17 and 21 respectively under the treatments with 40 60 and 80 of swhc primed plants showed higher soil water content for both varieties than plants without priming and v1 had higher soil water content than v2 3 2 plant growth during the early growth stage under drought primed plants had significantly reduced plant height than plants without priming table 1 after water recovery non primed plants still had significantly greater plant height compared with the primed ones for both varieties however during the subsequent drought stresses non primed plants showed growth retardation and they were significantly lower than the primed plants on 60 dat within the three soil moisture treatments the greatest plant height was noted in the high soil moisture treatment when compared to other moisture treatments across the subsequent soil water stress and variety treatments primed plants showed significantly lower leaf area the subsequent soil water stresses and varieties also significantly affected the leaf area under the same subsequent soil water stress level for each variety leaf area was lower for the primed than the non primed plants however the differences were not statistically significant table 1 there were significant interactions between drought priming subsequent soil water stresses and varieties on leaf area 3 3 photosynthetic rate stomatal conductance and intrinsic wue drought priming at the early growth stage significantly affected the an gs and wuei fig 3 table 2 primed plants had significantly lower an gs while higher wuei than plants without priming after water recovery an gs and wuei of plants with priming recovered and were similar to plants without priming during the subsequent drought period significantly higher an and gs but lower wuei were found for the primed plants than plants without priming for both varieties across the priming and variety treatments subsequent soil water stresses significantly decreased an and gs while increased wuei compared to the treatment with 80 of swhc under the three different soil moisture conditions v1 showed significantly higher an and gs but lower wuei under subsequent drought stress treatments than those of v2 3 4 leaf and root water potential the lwp and rwp were significantly influenced by earlier and later drought stresses fig 4 table 3 during the early period across the varieties primed plants had significantly lower lwp compared with plants without priming after water recovery lwp of primed plants and well watered plants for v1 were similar while lwp of primed plants in v2 remained significantly lower than plants without priming during the subsequent drought stress period when analyzed across the subsequent soil water and variety treatments primed plants possessed significantly higher lwp and rwp in comparison to non primed plants however under each subsequent soil water stress level the rwp was not statistically significant between primed and non primed plants fig 4 table 3 significant correlations were found between swc lwp and rwp fig 5 lwp was significantly positively correlated with rwp fig 6 furthermore significant positive relationship was found between gs and lwp during the subsequent drought stress period 3 5 plant hormone concentrations drought during the early period of growth increased aba leaf and iaa leaf significantly for both varieties fig 7 table 3 after water recovery the analysis across the varieties showed that the primed plants had significantly higher aba leaf and iaa leaf on 18 dat across the priming and variety treatments the subsequent drought stresses during the later growth stage increased leaf and root hormone concentrations significantly figs 7 and 8 during most of the subsequent soil water stress period primed plants maintained lower aba leaf and aba root while higher iaa leaf and iaa root when compared with the plants without priming significant positive relationships were observed between aba leaf and iaa leaf between aba leaf and lwp between aba root and rwp and also between aba leaf and gs during the subsequent drought stress period fig 6 significant interactions between drought priming and subsequent soil water stress or between variety and subsequent soil water stress were found for aba leaf and iaa leaf on 41 and 62 dat table 3 3 6 dry biomass grain yield water consumption wpy wpb and leaf δ13c the drought priming subsequent soil water stress and variety affected significantly the biomass production water consumption wpy wpb and plant δ13c except grain yield between the two varieties table 4 however under the same soil water level for each variety the dry biomass was similar between the primed and non primed plants except the 40 soil water level for v1 across the subsequent soil water stress and variety treatments primed plants notably consumed less water than plants without priming whereas drought priming significantly increased grain yield wpb and wpy moreover under the same soil water level for each variety primed plants significantly improved grain yield wpb and wpy except wpb under the 40 of swhc table 4 across the priming and variety treatments the subsequent drought stresses affected significantly biomass production grain yield water consumption wpb and wpy in comparison to the control the analysis across the subsequent soil water levels showed that primed plants had significantly lower leaf δ13c under 40 and 60 of swhc in v1 whereas in v2 the primed plants maintained significantly higher leaf δ13c than plants without priming compared with 80 of swhc across the priming and variety treatments the subsequent drought stresses during the later growth stage resulted in significant increases in leaf δ13c compared to the treatment with 80 of swhc when analyzed across the priming and subsequent soil water stress treatments v1 showed higher leaf δ13c compared with v2 there were significant interactions between priming subsequent soil water stress and variety on dry biomass water consumption and wpb wpb was positively correlated with leaf δ13c fig 9 4 discussion the growth period of flowering and pod filling is the mostly sensitive and critical phase affecting grain yield production of cowpea under drought hamidou et al 2007 the yield reduction is due to inhibition of photosynthesis through stomatal limitations and decreased assimilate partitioning into seeds daryanto et al 2015 hence enhancing drought tolerance of cowpea offers an opportunity to sustain grain yield production in regions where the crop is prone to drought at different stages of its life cycle it has been shown that pre exposure to drought during earlier period could improve later drought tolerance however how drought priming alleviating drought stress during the later period of cowpea remains unclear furthermore previous studies have not shown yet whether drought priming at an early growth stage could improve wp via physiological regulation therefore drought stress was imposed during the early period in order to examine the impact of drought priming and subsequent drought on gas exchange of leaves wp and plant hormones to explore the priming mechanisms on physiology and wp of cowpea the results showed that drought primed plants acquired a stress imprint that alleviated subsequent drought stress occurring during the flowering and seed filling growth period as exemplified by the enhancement in leaf gas exchange fig 3 table 2 high leaf and root water potential fig 4 table 3 and the maintenance of lower aba leaf and aba root of plants fig 7 table 3 with drought priming than non primed treatment when analyzed across the subsequent soil water stress and variety treatments photosynthesis can be significantly affected by drought stress which causes great yield loss chaves et al 2009 drought stresses during the flowering to maturity growth stage resulted in a significant decrease in an and gs however plants under priming treatment significantly improved an and gs than plants without priming treatment which could contribute to maintaining plant productivity lawlor and cornic 2002 consequently the wuei of plants experiencing priming was lower than plants without priming due to the more pronouncedly enhanced gs in good agreement with this enhancement of leaf gas exchange was observed in previous studies in wheat under drought priming abid et al 2017 higher an in plants with priming could be due to lower stomatal and non stomatal limitation on an when plants were under water stress liu et al 2017 moreover better plant water status for plants with priming could have contributed to maintaining leaf photosynthetic functioning and remaining the stomata opening during the subsequent drought stresses abid et al 2016 the increase of aba level under reduced soil water contents can induce stomatal limitation wilkinson and davies 2010 this was the case in our study where drought at the early growth stage caused significant decreases in lwp accompanied by significant increases in aba leaf resulting in lower stomatal conductance and growth retardation observed in the drought stressed plants at the early growth stage the significant correlation between aba leaf and aba root fig 6 indicated the root to shoot aba signaling induced stomatal closure and limited leaf development thus minimized transpirational water loss tardieu et al 2010 across the priming and variety treatments the subsequent drought stresses during the later growth stage significantly increased aba leaf and iaa leaf compared with the treatment under 80 of swhc nonetheless the primed plants maintained lower aba leaf while higher iaa leaf in comparison to non primed plants on 18 and 41 dat or harvest across the subsequent soil water stress and variety treatments previous studies showed increased pustovoitova et al 2004 or decreased man et al 2011 iaa content in response to drought stress for tobacco seedlings the concentration of iaa increased during several days after treatment whereas it decreased on 7 and 9 days after treatment wang et al 2018 it seems that the changes in iaa concentration under drought stress depend largely upon the experimental period and the stress imposed the better plant water status resulted in the maintenance of lower aba leaf for primed plants induced by earlier drought priming across the subsequent soil water stress and variety treatments the significantly or slightly increased iaa leaf and iaa root for plants with priming could be associated with its role in cell division and expansion especially the apical dominance of the main stem feng et al 2016 this is supported by the data of plant height where primed plants showed higher plant height as compared to non primed plants at harvest similarly abid et al 2017 found that wheat with drought priming showed lower aba while higher iaa concentration in grain that was associated with grain yield improvement previous studies have reported increased aba leaf simultaneously with decreased iaa leaf to drought zhang et al 2009 increases in aba leaf and iaa leaf were observed when plants were water stressed during the earlier and later period increases in iaa leaf was connected to plant s adaptation to drought pustovoitova et al 2004 the significant positive association between aba leaf and iaa leaf fig 6 supported the fact that both aba and iaa could play roles for plants in the adaptation to drought pustovoitova et al 2004 it is noteworthy that the significant interactions were detected between drought priming and subsequent soil water stress levels for aba leaf and iaa leaf on 41 dat and 62 dat indicating that the responses in chemical and hydraulic signals of plants to drought priming varied when plants were under different soil water conditions at later growth stages drought decreases biomass production in many crop species including cowpea daryanto et al 2017 across the subsequent soil water stresses and varieties the leaf area was significantly reduced by drought priming however under the same soil water level for each variety the leaf area was similar between the primed an non primed plants the significant interactions between the drought priming subsequent soil water stress and variety indicated that the impact of drought priming varied with soil water regimes and the responses of plants to drought priming and different soil water stress levels were related with varieties the subsequent drought stresses 60 and 40 of swhc during the later growth stage resulted in a significant reduction of biomass compared with plants under 80 of swhc however under the same subsequent soil water level for each variety the dry biomass was similar between the primed and non primed plants table 4 however the water consumed by primed plants was considerably reduced in consequence the wpb was significantly enhanced for primed plants compared with non primed plants for v1 and v2 primed plants increased significantly wpb by 19 and 17 respectively in comparison to plants without priming nonetheless it is noteworthy that when analyzed across the subsequent soil water and variety treatments priming reduced the biomass production significantly drought during flowering to maturity is usually the most affecting grain yield of cowpea daryanto et al 2015 it was reported that drought priming could reduce the yield loss of plants with priming during the subsequent stresses liu et al 2017 in the current study the subsequent drought stresses resulted in a significant reduction of grain yield compared with the treatment under 80 of swhc however primed plants significantly improved grain yield under each soil water level in comparison to plants without priming table 4 the maintenance of high photosynthetic rate under the subsequent drought during the reproductive stage could have contributed to improving the yield of primed plants in comparison to non primed plants table 4 the adaptation of crops to water inadequacy is proposed to be connected to wp hall 2012 since the increase of world population is demanding more irrigation to enhance crop productivity the improvement of wp seems to be a promising strategy to meet the future food demand donohue et al 2013 across the subsequent soil water stress and variety treatments or under the same soil water stress level for each variety drought priming significantly increased wpy compared with plants without priming table 4 this is ascribed to the significantly improved grain yield while markedly decreased water consumption of cowpea this result revealed that priming at the early growth stage could be a promising strategy to save water and improve wp of crops especially in the area where water is scarce to investigate further how drought priming regulates wp in response to subsequent drought stresses leaf δ13c was determined to indicate long term wp it has been reported that drought stress increases leaf δ13c makoi et al 2010 flanagan and farquhar 2014 as a result of partial stomatal closure in agreement the analysis across the drought priming and variety treatments showed that leaf δ13c increased under subsequent drought stresses with improved wpb compared to the treatment under 80 of swhc table 4 in addition leaf δ13c was significantly and positively correlated with wpb fig 9 difference in δ13c of leaves is regulated by an and or gs farquhar and richards 1984 across the subsequent soil water stress and variety treatments drought priming significantly increased leaf δ13c indicating the optimized leaf gas exchange for high wp the results showed that leaf δ13c of v1 was significantly lower than v2 table 4 the lower leaf δ13c for v1 compared with v2 might be due to its high drought tolerance moreover the lower leaf δ13c for v1 can also be due to higher stomatal aperture leading to a decrease of δ13c robinson et al 2000 taking together the results mentioned above this study revealed that drought priming applied at the early growth stage acquired in cowpea plants a stress memory that mitigated subsequent drought stress at the later growth stage 5 conclusions drought primed plants acquired a stress imprint that alleviated subsequent drought stress at later stages by the improvement of photosynthetic rate stomatal conductance and better plant water status as well as lower aba leaf while higher iaa leaf under subsequent drought stress in comparison to non primed plants contributing to maintaining leaf photosynthetic functioning and plant productivity even though the dry biomass was similar between the primed and non primed plants under the same soil water level for each variety the water consumed by primed plants was considerably reduced resulting in significantly enhanced wpb for primed plants the subsequent drought stresses resulted in a significant reduction of grain yield however primed plants significantly improved grain yield under soil water stress in comparison to plants without priming due to the maintenance of high photosynthetic rate under the subsequent drought during the reproductive stage in comparison to non primed plants consequently drought priming significantly increased wpy compared with plants without priming the results indicate that drought priming may be a potential strategy to mitigate subsequent drought stress and save irrigation water for cowpeas declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgments this

10269,drought occurring at the reproductive stage is the most critical phase affecting cowpea production it remains unclear whether drought priming at the early growth stage can be employed to alleviate drought stress during the post anthesis drought period and improve water productivity wp in cowpea therefore the physiological responses and wp as affected by drought priming were investigated two cowpea varieties tolerant v1 and sensitive v2 to drought stress were submitted to drought priming followed by water recovery and then subjected to subsequent drought stresses 80 60 and 40 of soil water holding capacity swhc the results showed that cowpea pre exposed to drought priming acquired a stress imprint that alleviated the subsequent drought stress which occurred during the later growth stage as exemplified by the improvement of water status photosynthesis water productivity of biomass wpb and yield wpy as well as the modulation of plant hormones under the drought stress during the post anthesis period primed plants maintained lower aba leaf and higher iaa leaf than plants without priming due to better plant water status for drought primed plants the results revealed that drought priming could modulate against aba leaf increase under drought as elevated aba leaf was the main reason for stomatal limitation thereby decreasing photosynthesis and leading to great yield loss primed plants consumed 32 and 24 less water for v1 and v2 respectively which significantly increased wp while decreased intrinsic water use efficiency wuei of drought primed plants it is suggested that drought priming during the early growth period can be used as a promising strategy to save water use for irrigation while improving wp of crops in the regions where water is scarce

in the world daryanto et al 2017 in future climate scenarios drought frequency and severity coupled with rising temperature are expected to increase cook et al 2014 particularly for cowpea production in the water scarce regions where drought is the utmost constraint leading to great yield loss cowpea is a major crop species with superior nutritional attributes cultivated in africa and many developing countries however drought occurring during different growth stages can reduce division and expansion of cells leading to growth retardation and dramatic yield losses fatokun et al 2012 drought at the reproductive stage can dramatically reduce cowpea s productivity hamidou et al 2007 this is due to the reduction in the duration of the reproductive stage and branch number resulting in reduction of pod number and seed weight and it was found that drought applied five weeks after sowing caused flower abortion and dramatically decreased grain yield by 67 fatokun et al 2012 a similar reduction in grain yield and fodder by 65 and 40 respectively was observed under post flowering drought stress in cowpea growing in the field belko et al 2014 in addition drought applied during vegetative and flowering periods has also been found to reduce leaf area and affect grain quality hamidou et al 2007 drought stress decreases photosynthesis stomatal conductance transpiration and

significant ducan s multiple range test dmrt was used to compare the differences between the treatments regression analyses were determined to assess the correlations between two parameters 3 results 3 1 soil water dynamics under drought priming the average soil water content reduced from 24 to 10 in primed plants whereas for non primed plants the average soil water content was kept at around 24 for both varieties fig 2 after 6 day recovery similar soil water contents at around 23 were observed for plants with and without priming during the subsequent stresses soil water contents for v1 of primed plants remained at around 13 18 and 22 respectively whereas for the non primed plants they were kept at around 12 17 and 21 respectively under the treatments with 40 60 and 80 of swhc primed plants showed higher soil water content for both varieties than plants without priming and v1 had higher soil water content than v2 3 2 plant growth during the early growth stage under drought primed plants had significantly reduced plant height than plants without priming table 1 after water recovery non primed plants still had significantly greater plant height compared with the primed ones for both varieties however during the subsequent drought stresses non primed plants showed growth retardation and they were significantly lower than the primed plants on 60 dat within the three soil moisture treatments the greatest plant height was noted in the high soil moisture treatment when compared to other moisture treatments across the subsequent soil water stress and variety treatments primed plants showed significantly lower leaf area the subsequent soil water stresses and varieties also significantly affected the leaf area under the same subsequent soil water stress level for each variety leaf area was lower for the primed than the non primed plants however the differences were not statistically significant table 1 there were significant interactions between drought priming subsequent soil water stresses and varieties on leaf area 3 3 photosynthetic rate stomatal conductance and intrinsic wue drought priming at the early growth stage significantly affected the an gs and wuei fig 3 table 2 primed plants had significantly lower an gs while higher wuei than plants without priming after water recovery an gs and wuei of plants with priming recovered and were similar to plants without priming during the subsequent drought period significantly higher an and gs but lower wuei were found for the primed plants than plants without priming for both varieties across the priming and variety treatments subsequent soil water stresses significantly decreased an and gs while increased wuei compared to the treatment with 80 of swhc under the three different soil moisture conditions v1 showed significantly higher an and gs but lower wuei under subsequent drought stress treatments than those of v2 3 4 leaf and root water potential the lwp and rwp were significantly influenced by earlier and later drought stresses fig 4 table 3 during the early period across the varieties primed plants had significantly lower lwp compared with plants without priming after water recovery lwp of primed plants and well watered plants for v1 were similar while lwp of primed plants in v2 remained significantly lower than plants without priming during the subsequent drought stress period when analyzed across the subsequent soil water and variety treatments primed plants possessed significantly higher lwp and rwp in comparison to non primed plants however under each subsequent soil water stress level the rwp was not statistically significant between primed and non primed plants fig 4 table 3 significant correlations were found between swc lwp and rwp fig 5 lwp was significantly positively correlated with rwp fig 6 furthermore significant positive relationship was found between gs and lwp during the subsequent drought stress period 3 5 plant hormone concentrations drought during the early period of growth increased aba leaf and iaa leaf significantly for both varieties fig 7 table 3 after water recovery the analysis across the varieties showed that the primed plants had significantly higher aba leaf and iaa leaf on 18 dat across the priming and variety treatments the subsequent drought stresses during the later growth stage increased leaf and root hormone concentrations significantly figs 7 and 8 during most of the subsequent soil water stress period primed plants maintained lower aba leaf and aba root while higher iaa leaf and iaa root when compared with the plants without priming significant positive relationships were observed between aba leaf and iaa leaf between aba leaf and lwp between aba root and rwp and also between aba leaf and gs during the subsequent drought stress period fig 6 significant interactions between drought priming and subsequent soil water stress or between variety and subsequent soil water stress were found for aba leaf and iaa leaf on 41 and 62 dat table 3 3 6 dry biomass grain yield water consumption wpy wpb and leaf δ13c the drought priming subsequent soil water stress and variety affected significantly the biomass production water consumption wpy wpb and plant δ13c except grain yield between the two varieties table 4 however under the same soil water level for each variety the dry biomass was similar between the primed and non primed plants except the 40 soil water level for v1 across the subsequent soil water stress and variety treatments primed plants notably consumed less water than plants without priming whereas drought priming significantly increased grain yield wpb and wpy moreover under the same soil water level for each variety primed plants significantly improved grain yield wpb and wpy except wpb under the 40 of swhc table 4 across the priming and variety treatments the subsequent drought stresses affected significantly biomass production grain yield water consumption wpb and wpy in comparison to the control the analysis across the subsequent soil water levels showed that primed plants had significantly lower leaf δ13c under 40 and 60 of swhc in v1 whereas in v2 the primed plants maintained significantly higher leaf δ13c than plants without priming compared with 80 of swhc across the priming and variety treatments the subsequent drought stresses during the later growth stage resulted in significant increases in leaf δ13c compared to the treatment with 80 of swhc when analyzed across the priming and subsequent soil water stress treatments v1 showed higher leaf δ13c compared with v2 there were significant interactions between priming subsequent soil water stress and variety on dry biomass water consumption and wpb wpb was positively correlated with leaf δ13c fig 9 4 discussion the growth period of flowering and pod filling is the mostly sensitive and critical phase affecting grain yield production of cowpea under drought hamidou et al 2007 the yield reduction is due to inhibition of photosynthesis through stomatal limitations and decreased assimilate partitioning into seeds daryanto et al 2015 hence enhancing drought tolerance of cowpea offers an opportunity to sustain grain yield production in regions where the crop is prone to drought at different stages of its life cycle it has been shown that pre exposure to drought during earlier period could improve later drought tolerance however how drought priming alleviating drought stress during the later period of cowpea remains unclear furthermore previous studies have not shown yet whether drought priming at an early growth stage could improve wp via physiological regulation therefore drought stress was imposed during the early period in order to examine the impact of drought priming and subsequent drought on gas exchange of leaves wp and plant hormones to explore the priming mechanisms on physiology and wp of cowpea the results showed that drought primed plants acquired a stress imprint that alleviated subsequent drought stress occurring during the flowering and seed filling growth period as exemplified by the enhancement in leaf gas exchange fig 3 table 2 high leaf and root water potential fig 4 table 3 and the maintenance of lower aba leaf and aba root of plants fig 7 table 3 with drought priming than non primed treatment when analyzed across the subsequent soil water stress and variety treatments photosynthesis can be significantly affected by drought stress which causes great yield loss chaves et al 2009 drought stresses during the flowering to maturity growth stage resulted in a significant decrease in an and gs however plants under priming treatment significantly improved an and gs than plants without priming treatment which could contribute to maintaining plant productivity lawlor and cornic 2002 consequently the wuei of plants experiencing priming was lower than plants without priming due to the more pronouncedly enhanced gs in good agreement with this enhancement of leaf gas exchange was observed in previous studies in wheat under drought priming abid et al 2017 higher an in plants with priming could be due to lower stomatal and non stomatal limitation on an when plants were under water stress liu et al 2017 moreover better plant water status for plants with priming could have contributed to maintaining leaf photosynthetic functioning and remaining the stomata opening during the subsequent drought stresses abid et al 2016 the increase of aba level under reduced soil water contents can induce stomatal limitation wilkinson and davies 2010 this was the case in our study where drought at the early growth stage caused significant decreases in lwp accompanied by significant increases in aba leaf resulting in lower stomatal conductance and growth retardation observed in the drought stressed plants at the early growth stage the significant correlation between aba leaf and aba root fig 6 indicated the root to shoot aba signaling induced stomatal closure and limited leaf development thus minimized transpirational water loss tardieu et al 2010 across the priming and variety treatments the subsequent drought stresses during the later growth stage significantly increased aba leaf and iaa leaf compared with the treatment under 80 of swhc nonetheless the primed plants maintained lower aba leaf while higher iaa leaf in comparison to non primed plants on 18 and 41 dat or harvest across the subsequent soil water stress and variety treatments previous studies showed increased pustovoitova et al 2004 or decreased man et al 2011 iaa content in response to drought stress for tobacco seedlings the concentration of iaa increased during several days after treatment whereas it decreased on 7 and 9 days after treatment wang et al 2018 it seems that the changes in iaa concentration under drought stress depend largely upon the experimental period and the stress imposed the better plant water status resulted in the maintenance of lower aba leaf for primed plants induced by earlier drought priming across the subsequent soil water stress and variety treatments the significantly or slightly increased iaa leaf and iaa root for plants with priming could be associated with its role in cell division and expansion especially the apical dominance of the main stem feng et al 2016 this is supported by the data of plant height where primed plants showed higher plant height as compared to non primed plants at harvest similarly abid et al 2017 found that wheat with drought priming showed lower aba while higher iaa concentration in grain that was associated with grain yield improvement previous studies have reported increased aba leaf simultaneously with decreased iaa leaf to drought zhang et al 2009 increases in aba leaf and iaa leaf were observed when plants were water stressed during the earlier and later period increases in iaa leaf was connected to plant s adaptation to drought pustovoitova et al 2004 the significant positive association between aba leaf and iaa leaf fig 6 supported the fact that both aba and iaa could play roles for plants in the adaptation to drought pustovoitova et al 2004 it is noteworthy that the significant interactions were detected between drought priming and subsequent soil water stress levels for aba leaf and iaa leaf on 41 dat and 62 dat indicating that the responses in chemical and hydraulic signals of plants to drought priming varied when plants were under different soil water conditions at later growth stages drought decreases biomass production in many crop species including cowpea daryanto et al 2017 across the subsequent soil water stresses and varieties the leaf area was significantly reduced by drought priming however under the same soil water level for each variety the leaf area was similar between the primed an non primed plants the significant interactions between the drought priming subsequent soil water stress and variety indicated that the impact of drought priming varied with soil water regimes and the responses of plants to drought priming and different soil water stress levels were related with varieties the subsequent drought stresses 60 and 40 of swhc during the later growth stage resulted in a significant reduction of biomass compared with plants under 80 of swhc however under the same subsequent soil water level for each variety the dry biomass was similar between the primed and non primed plants table 4 however the water consumed by primed plants was considerably reduced in consequence the wpb was significantly enhanced for primed plants compared with non primed plants for v1 and v2 primed plants increased significantly wpb by 19 and 17 respectively in comparison to plants without priming nonetheless it is noteworthy that when analyzed across the subsequent soil water and variety treatments priming reduced the biomass production significantly drought during flowering to maturity is usually the most affecting grain yield of cowpea daryanto et al 2015 it was reported that drought priming could reduce the yield loss of plants with priming during the subsequent stresses liu et al 2017 in the current study the subsequent drought stresses resulted in a significant reduction of grain yield compared with the treatment under 80 of swhc however primed plants significantly improved grain yield under each soil water level in comparison to plants without priming table 4 the maintenance of high photosynthetic rate under the subsequent drought during the reproductive stage could have contributed to improving the yield of primed plants in comparison to non primed plants table 4 the adaptation of crops to water inadequacy is proposed to be connected to wp hall 2012 since the increase of world population is demanding more irrigation to enhance crop productivity the improvement of wp seems to be a promising strategy to meet the future food demand donohue et al 2013 across the subsequent soil water stress and variety treatments or under the same soil water stress level for each variety drought priming significantly increased wpy compared with plants without priming table 4 this is ascribed to the significantly improved grain yield while markedly decreased water consumption of cowpea this result revealed that priming at the early growth stage could be a promising strategy to save water and improve wp of crops especially in the area where water is scarce to investigate further how drought priming regulates wp in response to subsequent drought stresses leaf δ13c was determined to indicate long term wp it has been reported that drought stress increases leaf δ13c makoi et al 2010 flanagan and farquhar 2014 as a result of partial stomatal closure in agreement the analysis across the drought priming and variety treatments showed that leaf δ13c increased under subsequent drought stresses with improved wpb compared to the treatment under 80 of swhc table 4 in addition leaf δ13c was significantly and positively correlated with wpb fig 9 difference in δ13c of leaves is regulated by an and or gs farquhar and richards 1984 across the subsequent soil water stress and variety treatments drought priming significantly increased leaf δ13c indicating the optimized leaf gas exchange for high wp the results showed that leaf δ13c of v1 was significantly lower than v2 table 4 the lower leaf δ13c for v1 compared with v2 might be due to its high drought tolerance moreover the lower leaf δ13c for v1 can also be due to higher stomatal aperture leading to a decrease of δ13c robinson et al 2000 taking together the results mentioned above this study revealed that drought priming applied at the early growth stage acquired in cowpea plants a stress memory that mitigated subsequent drought stress at the later growth stage 5 conclusions drought primed plants acquired a stress imprint that alleviated subsequent drought stress at later stages by the improvement of photosynthetic rate stomatal conductance and better plant water status as well as lower aba leaf while higher iaa leaf under subsequent drought stress in comparison to non primed plants contributing to maintaining leaf photosynthetic functioning and plant productivity even though the dry biomass was similar between the primed and non primed plants under the same soil water level for each variety the water consumed by primed plants was considerably reduced resulting in significantly enhanced wpb for primed plants the subsequent drought stresses resulted in a significant reduction of grain yield however primed plants significantly improved grain yield under soil water stress in comparison to plants without priming due to the maintenance of high photosynthetic rate under the subsequent drought during the reproductive stage in comparison to non primed plants consequently drought priming significantly increased wpy compared with plants without priming the results indicate that drought priming may be a potential strategy to mitigate subsequent drought stress and save irrigation water for cowpeas declaration of competing
