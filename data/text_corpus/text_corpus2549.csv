hydraulic fracturing technology has enabled the recovery of oil and gas from low permeability rocks such as tight sandstone shale and coal beds 5 6 hydraulic fracturing operations involve injecting water and proppant ceramic or sand containing about 2 added fracturing fluid frac fluid under pressure into the rock formation 7 frac fluids consist of additives such as biocides scale inhibitors solvents friction reducers corrosion inhibitors and non ionic surfactants 7 9 the high pressure liquid is used to fracture the rock formation the pressure is released and the flow back water plus oil or gas and co produced water is recovered the proppant used in hydraulic fracturing prevents collapse of the fissures created in the rock formation thus the permeability of the rock is increased allowing recovery of the oil or gas disposal of flow back and co produced water referred to as produced water is a major environmental challenge 10 11 due to the added frac fluid oil and contaminants from the geological formation it is highly impaired frequently multiple unit operations are needed if the water is to be treated and reused for beneficial applications the level of treatment of the produced water depends on the beneficial use of the treated water 9 12 15 the first stage of treatment primary treatment is sufficient to remove suspended solids and free oil from the produced water resulting in water for deep well injection into a geologically isolated formation secondary treatment is used to further treat the water for reuse to stimulate new wells finally tertiary treatment operations result in water which can be discharged directly into lakes and rivers jiménez et al provide a detailed summary of the unit operations typically considered for primary secondary and tertiary treatment of produced water 3 here an electrocoagulation ec process has been developed for pretreating produced water prior to membrane distillation while previous investigators have tended to focus on optimizing the membrane distillation operation this paper focus on understanding the ec process thus providing new insights into the development of a combined unit operation several advantages can be achieved when using ec compared to chemical coagulation such as elimination of flocculant addition ease of operation production of more easily separable flocs lower sludge volume and efficient removal of the smallest colloidal particles 16 21 ec has been used as a pretreatment process or a post treatment process depending on the type of wastewater showing that it is effective at removing contaminants when integrated with other treatment methods 22 26 in ec ions are supplied by a sacrificial electrode however depending on the electrode potential direct reaction with species in the water can occur on the electrode surface charged species in the wastewater are removed by reaction with oppositely charged ions or with flocs of metallic hydroxide generated in the wastewater 27 the performance of membrane distillation is compared with and without pretreatment by ec 2 theoretical background 2 1 half cell reactions and electrode potentials ec is a complex process involving electrochemical metal dissolution while water is reduced some of the pollutants present could be oxidized or reduced in addition chemical reactions such as acid base reactions with ph changes hydroxide precipitation redox reaction in the bulk solution as well as physical processes such as adsorption and coagulation occur the ec process begins with dissolution of a sacrificial electrode table 1 gives the standard state reduction potentials 28 at 25 c for possible reactions that may occur during ec of the produced water samples tested here at the anode the metal present in the sacrificial metal electrode is oxidized 1 m m z z e where m is the metal atom and z is the number of electrons transferred per metal atom 29 if a high anode potential is used large voltage differences between the anode and cathode secondary reactions such as the oxidation of water can occur 30 31 leading to a local decrease in ph and oxygen generation similarly in the presence of cl ions cl2 could be produced at the cathode reduction of water occurs see table 1 2 2 h 2 o 2 e h 2 2 o h it is important to note that faraday s law only applies when all the electrons in the system participate in the metal dissolution reaction when competing reactions occur a current efficiency factor must be used in the case of a sacrificial al electrode the reduction potential of al3 is lower than that of water see table 1 consequently both chemical and electrochemical dissolution are possible in fact cañizares et al indicate that the two processes often occur in parallel which could lead to a current efficiency greater than 1 32 given the complexity of produced water and the presence of many other species other side reactions are also possible variations from standard conditions may be accounted

are the stoichiometric coefficients of the products in the half cell equation substituting for the constants into the above equation yields the following 16 e e 0 0591 n log product x reactants y for the produced water investigated here see table 2 ph 7 2 and cl 89 266 0 mg l 1 2 51 m the reduction potentials were then calculated using the nernst equation and e ph diagram 29 fig 1 shows the reduction potentials for species transformation using the produced water as the electrolyte solution having been released from the anode the metal ions usually form metal hydroxides that have low solubility and can precipitate however specially for aluminum ions various equilibrium acid base complexation precipitation and redox reactions occur water soluble pollutants typically organic species in the produced water adsorb onto the precipitates colloidal suspensions are destabilized during ec coagulation of these particles occurs due to interactions between the soluble ions generated by metal dissolution from the sacrificial electrodes this leads to a reduction in the repulsive forces between particles resulting in aggregation 29 charge neutralization by adsorption of metal ion species will also lead to aggregation finally entrapment of colloidal particles within a hydroxide precipitate will lead to aggregation the destabilization processes occur in parallel the extent to which any one process dominates depends on the prevailing conditions after destabilization flocculation occurs the rate of which depends on the degree of destabilization of the colloidal particles as well as the particle collision rate the flocs can rise due to the rising hydrogen gas produced the flocs eventually age densify and settle to the bottom the flocculated material or sludge can be removed by sedimentation here after sludge removal the treated water is further processed by direct contact membrane distillation 25 in the ec process investigated here both the cathode and anode consisted of either iron or aluminum in addition a mixed electrode set up was used where the bipolar electrodes were iron and aluminum but the anode and cathode at the end of the array of electrodes were the same iron electrodes other variations have been proposed where changes are made to the cathode material or the solution 34 36 3 materials and methods 3 1 materials the produced water was collected from the oil fields in texas usa it was treated with clo2 at the oil field it is common that produced water is treated by clo2 is to reduce emulsion formation due to iron and to control microbial growth the produced water was analyzed by the arkansas water resources center university of arkansas fayetteville ar usa deionized di water used throughout the investigation was collected from thermo fisher 18 mω barnstead smart2pure system schwerte germany deionized water was used for rinsing and washing the electrodes and other equipment aluminum and alloy steel sheets with thickness of 0 04 were purchased from onlinemetals com seattle wa 3 2 ec reactor design and operation three electrode configurations were considered 5 iron 3 iron and 2 aluminum and 5 aluminum each electrode configuration was tested using current of 3 a and 5 a for 5 min the 5 min reaction time was based on our previous results which indicate this as an appropriate reaction time similarly 3 and 5 a were chosen based on previous work longer reaction times and higher currents may not be practical shorter reaction times generally do not lead to addition of sufficient ions 37 a dc power supply hewlett packard palp alto ca was used with cathode and anode attached to electrodes with a bipolar series bps electrode arrangement only the first and last electrodes are connected directly to the power supply hakizimana et al 29 and garcia sergura et al 38 provide a summary of the various electrode arrangements that are commonly used and their advantages and disadvantages the formation of passivation layers on the electrodes was mitigated by a reverse polarity switch connected directly to the dc power to enable the direction of the current to alternate every 30 s these passivation layers can suppress further reactions if reverse polarity were not used 39 40 before each experiment the electrodes were cleaned using 10 v v nitric acid solution sandpapered and dried fig s1 supplementary data is a schematic diagram of the continuous ec reactor a custom built polycarbonate ec reactor with a total volume of 1078 cm3 was used to conduct all the ec experiments there are two chambers in the reactor the left one is the main reaction chamber having dimensions of 7 cm 11 cm 14 cm which holds the electrodes the right one is an overflow chamber that collects the treated water from outlet 4 see fig s1a the inlet to the reactor is connected with a liquid distributor with many holes to disperse the feed water evenly see fig s1b five electrodes were fitted vertically inside the reactor with a 10 mm inter electrode spacing and an effective surface area of 770 cm2 based on earlier screening studies a constant current of 3 or 5 a was tested here a constant current was maintained resulting in a variation in voltage across the electrodes due to changes in conductivity of the produced water during electrocoagulation as shown in fig s2 supplementary data 3 l of produced water were pumped into the reactor tracer tests using a dye solution were conducted to ensure dead zones were minimized in order to prevent the formation of dead zones the reactor contents were stirred fig s3b supplementary data shows the spreading of the dye solution at low flow rate 0 2 l min in the presence of mixing as can be seen no dead zone can be observed consequently stirring was included the detailed configuration of the electrodes in the reactor is illustrated in fig s4 supplementary data 3 3 sludge settling test in all ec experiments the first liter of treated water was wasted to ensure steady state was reached this was verified by making sure the current was stabilized which usually takes about 30 s then treated water approximately 1 l of water was collected using the second liter from the feed tank this sample was allowed to sediment and the supernatant used for membrane distillation md sludge settling tests were conducted using 1 l graduated cylinder the height of the liquid sludge interface h was recorded periodically over 3 h the dimensionless height of the liquid sludge interface is h h0 height of the liquid sludge interface at time t initial height of the ec treated water we note that the flocs initially rise due to production of hydrogen generated even after the water has been removed from the ec cell 3 4 md to investigate the effect of ec on md performance ec pretreated and non pretreated water was tested the md system used here has been described in our previous work 25 which is shown in fig 2 a custom made acrylic membrane cell with 40 cm2 effective membrane area and 2 mm deep channels was used as the membrane module ptfe spacers et 8700 industrial netting minneapolis mn usa were used for mechanical support and mixing feed and permeate streams were pumped on opposite sides of the membrane in counter current flow at 0 5 l min using two peristaltic pumps masterflex i p cole parmer vernon hills il the weight of the permeate was measured and recorded by a computer connected analytical balance mettler toledo columbus oh usa the feed water was maintained at 60 c by a heat exchanger heated by the circulating oil from a heater polyscience niles il usa the temperature of the permeate tank was maintained at 20 c using an external chiller polyscience niles il usa the water flux was calculated based on the weight change of the permeate tank the permeate conductivity was continuously monitored using a conductivity meter vwr radnor pa usa md experiments were run with an initial produced water feed volume of 800 ml di water was added to replace the permeate that was removed during the run the experiment was run for 6 h after this additional 200 ml of the same original feed produced water was added to the feed tank and the feed and permeate were removed without replacement consequently the contents of the feed tank were concentrated 3 5 material characterization 3 5 1 produced water characterization a shimadzu toc vcsh shimadzu scientific instruments colombia md was used to measure the total organic carbon toc using epa standard method 180 1 epa standard methods 160 1 160 2 and 415 1 were used to measure total dissolved solid tds total suspended solids tss and turbidity respectively a conductivity meter vwr radnor pa was used to measure the conductivity finally the cations and anions measured here were according to epa methods 200 7 and 300 0 respectively 3 5 2 sludge and membrane characterization scanning electron microscopy sem was used to determine the surface morphology and elemental analysis for each membrane before and after md using nova nanolab 200 duo beam workstation fei hillsboro or usa to further compare the difference between the iron hydroxide flocs and aluminum hydroxide flocs ls 13320 particle size analyzer beckman coulter brea ca usa sem and laser scanning confocal microscopy lscm leica sp5 confocal microscopes leica microsystems buffalo grove il usa were employed to investigate their morphology and physical characteristics 4 results and discussion 4 1 sludge settling characterization results for the analysis of the produced water used here are given in table 2 as can be seen the water is highly impaired as the tds toc tss and turbidity are all very high the main inorganic ions present are sodium potassium calcium and chloride a solid liquid interface was visible after the ec treated water was placed in the graduated cylinder the dimensionless height of the solid liquid interface versus the settling time for different electrode configurations is illustrated in fig 3a and b as can be seen for the higher current 5 a using only al electrodes there is an initial short period of relatively slow sludge settling followed by an increased rate of settling this is most likely due to the formation of a gel of polymeric hydroxides 41 this period of initial slow settling is significantly reduced for a current of 3 a and the subsequent decrease in the solid liquid interface height is much faster this is due to the lower number of al ions that are released the settling curves for iron and iron aluminum electrode combinations are quite different iron ions do not form polymeric hydroxides analogous to aluminum 41 there is no visible initial slow settling period rather a much more rapid decrease in the solid liquid interface occurs very quickly known as the regime of zone settling 42 44 next a slower transition settling region is reached finally compression settling is the last settling period with a steady and much smaller rate of height decrease of the solid liquid interface for the effluent treated by iron electrodes at same operating conditions more rapid settling was observed than with aluminum electrodes this experimental observation can be interpreted as follows at a higher current density the extent of anodic metal dissolution increases resulting in a greater amount of precipitate 41 the solids concentration increases but the settling resistance also increases which decreases the sludge settling velocity this is particularly true for polymeric aluminum hydroxides in addition unlike iron hydroxides higher concentration of aluminum hydroxide may result in significant gel formation 4 2 sludge volume index sludge volume index svi is frequently used to characterize settleability it is the dimensionless sludge height after 30 min of settling normalized by the initial sludge concentration svi h 30 h 0 x ss 1000 ml l 1 where h 30 is the sludge height after 30 min settling cm h 0 is the initial height of the sludge after ec in the settling column cm and ss is the initial sludge concentration after ec g l 1 results are given in fig 4 a higher svi indicates poorer compressibility of the sludge 45 46 the results indicate that higher currents give a less compressible sludge 47 the svi for aluminum electrodes 525 3 ml g is higher than the fe electrodes 100 2 ml g at 3a it is apparent that the svi for mixed electrodes is between the al and fe electrodes since the svi is related to the change in the height of the solid liquid interface during settling the results in figs 3 and 4 are in agreement 4 3 toc removal fig 5 indicates that toc removal is improved at 5a compared to 3a for both aluminum and iron electrodes for mixed iron aluminum electrodes there is no difference in toc removal at higher current however as shown in fig 4 the sludge volume index increased at a higher current for mixed iron and aluminum electrodes therefore it is essential to consider having not only high toc removal but also flocs that settled low svi easily when evaluating the ec operating conditions 4 4 sludge characterization fig 6 gives particle size distribution for the various flocs generated under the ec conditions of 5 a current and 5 min reaction time after settling for 3 h the number distribution fig 6 indicates the al flocs are large than the fe and fe al flocs at 5 a current floc morphology was investigated by lscm the results are given in fig 7 as can be seen the aluminum flocs are longer compared to the iron hydroxide flocs the flocs from the hybrid electrodes have both long entangled pieces and irregular sphere the al3 and oh generated at the electrodes react to form various monomeric and polymeric aluminum hydroxide species such as al oh 2 al6 oh 15 3 al7 oh 17 4 and al13 oh 34 5 which undergo complex polymerization and partly transform into insoluble amorphous aluminum hydroxides according to complex precipitation kinetics 32 48 49 these precipitates act as swift flocs and form long pieces with an open structure and have large surface areas which are helpful for fast adsorption of contaminants from wastewater 50 note a b and c are images at 200 times magnification d e and f are images at 400 times magnification the floc morphology was further investigated by filtering the sludge with filter paper and drying it sludges produced for a current of 5 a using different electrode configurations were investigated these dried sludge samples were characterized by sem as shown in fig 8 the iron hydroxide flocs were fluffier than the aluminum hydroxide flocs which have big chunks as mentioned the aluminum hydroxide flocs have an open structure and this kind of gel can potentially absorb more water than the iron hydroxide flocs 4 5 md performance during membrane distillation water vapor passes through the pores of a hydrophobic membrane the membrane prevents direct transfer of water with dissolved solutes from the feed to the permeate side of the membrane it is essential that dissolved organic compounds present in the feed be removed by ec fig 5 indicates that the greatest reduction of toc occurs when ec is conducted using a current of 5 a and 5 al electrodes consequently water treated using these conditions was used for membrane distillation as shown in fig 9a during constant concentration operation the normalized flux normalized by dividing by the initial flux over the first 10 min of operation for the produced water without ec pretreatment declined rapidly to 0 85 after 175 min of operation meanwhile the conductivity of the permeate increased to 35 μs cm which indicates membrane fouling pore wetting and salt passage the normalized flux for the produced water pretreated by electrocoagulation using 5a for 5 min also decreased though less than the unpretreated water further the increase in the conductivity of the permeate is also much less this shows that membrane fouling can be significantly mitigated by ec treatment foulants from the produced water such as oil and grease forming agents and surfactants 51 can be removed by ec treatment after 6 h of operation at constant concentration 200 ml of the initial feed water was added to the feed tank and then the system run under concentration mode the normalized flux vs the operation time is shown in fig 9b it is not unexpected that the normalized flux of these md runs decrease with time however the rate of flux decrease is highest when non pretreated water is used again the increase in conductivity is also less for ec pretreated water the tss and turbidity of the permeate after using md for produced water treated at 5 min reaction time and 5a current is 0 8 mg l 1 and 0 2 ntu respectively the sem images show changes in membrane morphology after use unused membranes have open pores shown in fig 10a and e however fig 10b and f shows blockage of the membrane pores if the unpretreated produced water is used a brownish color can be observed on the membrane surface shown in fig 11b instead of brown deposition from the un pretreated produced water fig 11c shows white deposits on the membrane surface after the md with ec treated produced water 5a with 5 min this indicates that ec can effectively removes these brown color foulants which is from the suspended organics and collides in the produced water 52 there is much less deposition on the membrane surface if produced water is pretreated by ec as confirmed by sem images fig 10c and g the average elemental ratios of carbon fluorine c f and oxygen fluorine o f for all membranes before and after md are given in table 3 as can be seen the c f and o f ratios of all the membranes increased after md which is mainly due to organic fouling 25 after md the c f ratios of the membranes increased by 77 2 and 38 1 compared to clean membrane for the unpretreated produced water and treatment with 5 min using 5a respectively as can be seen the greatest increase in the c f ratio was for the membrane challenged with unpretreated produced water due to the adsorption of the unremoved organic species the membrane surface having the least organic foulants based on the c f ratio change is for produced water pretreated using ec run table 4 shows inorganic element atom percentages the inorganic foulants on the membrane could be strontium sulfate 53 this is confirmed here since 7 65 strontium was observed on the membrane surface for unpretreated produced water though strontium was not one of the major components in the produced water see table 2 this is probably due to relatively low solubility of strontium sulfate 53 however it seems ec can reduce strontium deposited on the membrane surface the results obtained here indicate that ec may be used as a pretreatment step prior to a unit operation like md given the complexity of the ec process determining suitable conditions for ec will be highly dependent on the feed water quality the aim here was to maximize removal of toc while ensuring that the floc settling characteristics were not adversely affected however the pretreatment goal will depend on the subsequent unit operation it is important to determine the pretreatment conditions in conjunction with the subsequent unit operation 5 conclusions hydraulic fracturing produced water was treated by ec with al electrodes fe electrodes and fe al electrodes sludge settling for ec conducted using fe electrodes is much faster than the sludge generated by al electrodes which is likely due to the different morphology of metal hydroxides the iron hydroxide particles were smaller and had a higher density at higher current al hydroxides with gel like structure were formed which had lower settling speed because of the higher hydraulic resistances from the larger lower density particles the highest toc removal efficiency of 42 was obtained for ec with 5 al electrodes at 5 a current and 5 min reaction time which greatly decreased the membrane fouling during md the results obtained here indicate that by considering the species present in the produced water the likely electrolysis reaction can be determined however ec is very complex as not only electrolysis reactions occur further successful ec will require effective flocculation and floc densification these processes depend on the water quality and the operating conditions by analyzing the floc properties one can determine the removal efficiency of these species which can easily foul the membrane during md it is essential to design the ec and subsequent md

supplementary data is a schematic diagram of the continuous ec reactor a custom built polycarbonate ec reactor with a total volume of 1078 cm3 was used to conduct all the ec experiments there are two chambers in the reactor the left one is the main reaction chamber having dimensions of 7 cm 11 cm 14 cm which holds the electrodes the right one is an overflow chamber that collects the treated water from outlet 4 see fig s1a the inlet to the reactor is connected with a liquid distributor with many holes to disperse the feed water evenly see fig s1b five electrodes were fitted vertically inside the reactor with a 10 mm inter electrode spacing and an effective surface area of 770 cm2 based on earlier screening studies a constant current of 3 or 5 a was tested here a constant current was maintained resulting in a variation in voltage across the electrodes due to changes in conductivity of the produced water during electrocoagulation as shown in fig s2 supplementary data 3 l of produced water were pumped into the reactor tracer tests using a dye solution were conducted to ensure dead zones were minimized in order to prevent the formation of dead zones the reactor contents were stirred fig s3b supplementary data shows the spreading of the dye solution at low flow rate 0 2 l min in the presence of mixing as can be seen no dead zone can be observed consequently stirring was included the detailed configuration of the electrodes in the reactor is illustrated in fig s4 supplementary data 3 3 sludge settling test in all ec experiments the first liter of treated water was wasted to ensure steady state was reached this was verified by making sure the current was stabilized which usually takes about 30 s then treated water approximately 1 l of water was collected using the second liter from the feed tank this sample was allowed to sediment and the supernatant used for membrane distillation md sludge settling tests were conducted using 1 l graduated cylinder the height of the liquid sludge interface h was recorded periodically over 3 h the dimensionless height of the liquid sludge interface is h h0 height of the liquid sludge interface at time t initial height of the ec treated water we note that the flocs initially rise due to production of hydrogen generated even after the water has been removed from the ec cell 3 4 md to investigate the effect of ec on md performance ec pretreated and non pretreated water was tested the md system used here has been described in our previous work 25 which is shown in fig 2 a custom made acrylic membrane cell with 40 cm2 effective membrane area and 2 mm deep channels was used as the membrane module ptfe spacers et 8700 industrial netting minneapolis mn usa were used for mechanical support and mixing feed and permeate streams were pumped on opposite sides of the membrane in counter current flow at 0 5 l min using two peristaltic pumps masterflex i p cole parmer vernon hills il the weight of the permeate was measured and recorded by a computer connected analytical balance mettler toledo columbus oh usa the feed water was maintained at 60 c by a heat exchanger heated by the circulating oil from a heater polyscience niles il usa the temperature of the permeate tank was maintained at 20 c using an external chiller polyscience niles il usa the water flux was calculated based on the weight change of the permeate tank the permeate conductivity was continuously monitored using a conductivity meter vwr radnor pa usa md experiments were run with an initial produced water feed volume of 800 ml di water was added to replace the permeate that was removed during the run the experiment was run for 6 h after this additional 200 ml of the same original feed produced water was added to the feed tank and the feed and permeate were removed without replacement consequently the contents of the feed tank were concentrated 3 5 material characterization 3 5 1 produced water characterization a shimadzu toc vcsh shimadzu scientific instruments colombia md was used to measure the total organic carbon toc using epa standard method 180 1 epa standard methods 160 1 160 2 and 415 1 were used to measure total dissolved solid tds total suspended solids tss and turbidity respectively a conductivity meter vwr radnor pa was used to measure the conductivity finally the cations and anions measured here were according to epa methods 200 7 and 300 0 respectively 3 5 2 sludge and membrane characterization scanning electron microscopy sem was used to determine the surface morphology and elemental analysis for each membrane before and after md using nova nanolab 200 duo beam workstation fei hillsboro or usa to further compare the difference between the iron hydroxide flocs and aluminum hydroxide flocs ls 13320 particle size analyzer beckman coulter brea ca usa sem and laser scanning confocal microscopy lscm leica sp5 confocal microscopes leica microsystems buffalo grove il usa were employed to investigate their morphology and physical characteristics 4 results and discussion 4 1 sludge settling characterization results for the analysis of the produced water used here are given in table 2 as can be seen the water is highly impaired as the tds toc tss and turbidity are all very high the main inorganic ions present are sodium potassium calcium and chloride a solid liquid interface was visible after the ec treated water was placed in the graduated cylinder the dimensionless height of the solid liquid interface versus the settling time for different electrode configurations is illustrated in fig 3a and b as can be seen for the higher current 5 a using only al electrodes there is an initial short period of relatively slow sludge settling followed by an increased rate of settling this is most likely due to the formation of a gel of polymeric hydroxides 41 this period of initial slow settling is significantly reduced for a current of 3 a and the subsequent decrease in the solid liquid interface height is much faster this is due to the lower number of al ions that are released the settling curves for iron and iron aluminum electrode combinations are quite different iron ions do not form polymeric hydroxides analogous to aluminum 41 there is no visible initial slow settling period rather a much more rapid decrease in the solid liquid interface occurs very quickly known as the regime of zone settling 42 44 next a slower transition settling region is reached finally compression settling is the last settling period with a steady and much smaller rate of height decrease of the solid liquid interface for the effluent treated by iron electrodes at same operating conditions more rapid settling was observed than with aluminum electrodes this experimental observation can be interpreted as follows at a higher current density the extent of anodic metal dissolution increases resulting in a greater amount of precipitate 41 the solids concentration increases but the settling resistance also increases which decreases the sludge settling velocity this is particularly true for polymeric aluminum hydroxides in addition unlike iron hydroxides higher concentration of aluminum hydroxide may result in significant gel formation 4 2 sludge volume index sludge volume index svi is frequently used to characterize settleability it is the dimensionless sludge height after 30 min of settling normalized by the initial sludge concentration svi h 30 h 0 x ss 1000 ml l 1 where h 30 is the sludge height after 30 min settling cm h 0 is the initial height of the sludge after ec in the settling column cm and ss is the initial sludge concentration after ec g l 1 results are given in fig 4 a higher svi indicates poorer compressibility of the sludge 45 46 the results indicate that higher currents give a less compressible sludge 47 the svi for aluminum electrodes 525 3 ml g is higher than the fe electrodes 100 2 ml g at 3a it is apparent that the svi for mixed electrodes is between the al and fe electrodes since the svi is related to the change in the height of the solid liquid interface during settling the results in figs 3 and 4 are in agreement 4 3 toc removal fig 5 indicates that toc removal is improved at 5a compared to 3a for both aluminum and iron electrodes for mixed iron aluminum electrodes there is no difference in toc removal at higher current however as shown in fig 4 the sludge volume index increased at a higher current for mixed iron and aluminum electrodes therefore it is essential to consider having not only high toc removal but also flocs that settled low svi easily when evaluating the ec operating conditions 4 4 sludge characterization fig 6 gives particle size distribution for the various flocs generated under the ec conditions of 5 a current and 5 min reaction time after settling for 3 h the number distribution fig 6 indicates the al flocs are large than the fe and fe al flocs at 5 a current floc morphology was investigated by lscm the results are given in fig 7 as can be seen the aluminum flocs are longer compared to the iron hydroxide flocs the flocs from the hybrid electrodes have both long entangled pieces and irregular sphere the al3 and oh generated at the electrodes react to form various monomeric and polymeric aluminum hydroxide species such as al oh 2 al6 oh 15 3 al7 oh 17 4 and al13 oh 34 5 which undergo complex polymerization and partly transform into insoluble amorphous aluminum hydroxides according to complex precipitation kinetics 32 48 49 these precipitates act as swift flocs and form long pieces with an open structure and have large surface areas which are helpful for fast adsorption of contaminants from wastewater 50 note a b and c are images at 200 times magnification d e and f are images at 400 times magnification the floc morphology was further investigated by filtering the sludge with filter paper and drying it sludges produced for a current of 5 a using different electrode configurations were investigated these dried sludge samples were characterized by sem as shown in fig 8 the iron hydroxide flocs were fluffier than the aluminum hydroxide flocs which have big chunks as mentioned the aluminum hydroxide flocs have an open structure and this kind of gel can potentially absorb more water than the iron hydroxide flocs 4 5 md performance during membrane distillation water vapor passes through the pores of a hydrophobic membrane the membrane prevents direct transfer of water with dissolved solutes from the feed to the permeate side of the membrane it is essential that dissolved organic compounds present in the feed be removed by ec fig 5 indicates that the greatest reduction of toc occurs when ec is conducted using a current of 5 a and 5 al electrodes consequently water treated using these conditions was used for membrane distillation as shown in fig 9a during constant concentration operation the normalized flux normalized by dividing by the initial flux over the first 10 min of operation for the produced water without ec pretreatment declined rapidly to 0 85 after 175 min of operation meanwhile the conductivity of the permeate increased to 35 μs cm which indicates membrane fouling pore wetting and salt passage the normalized flux for the produced water pretreated by electrocoagulation using 5a for 5 min also decreased though less than the unpretreated water further the increase in the conductivity of the permeate is also much less this shows that membrane fouling can be significantly mitigated by ec treatment foulants from the produced water such as oil and grease forming agents and surfactants 51 can be removed by ec treatment after 6 h of operation at constant concentration 200 ml of the initial feed water was added to the feed tank and then the system run under concentration mode the normalized flux vs the operation time is shown in fig 9b it is not unexpected that the normalized flux of these md runs decrease with time however the rate of flux decrease is highest when non pretreated water is used again the increase in conductivity is also less for ec pretreated water the tss and turbidity of the permeate after using md for produced water treated at 5 min reaction time and 5a current is 0 8 mg l 1 and 0 2 ntu respectively the sem images show changes in membrane morphology after use unused membranes have open pores shown in fig 10a and e however fig 10b and f shows blockage of the membrane pores if the unpretreated produced water is used a brownish color can be observed on the membrane surface shown in fig 11b instead of brown deposition from the un pretreated produced water fig 11c shows white deposits on the membrane surface after the md with ec treated produced water 5a with 5 min this indicates that ec can effectively removes these brown color foulants which is from the suspended organics and collides in the produced water 52 there is much less deposition on the membrane surface if produced water is pretreated by ec as confirmed by sem images fig 10c and g the average elemental ratios of carbon fluorine c f and oxygen fluorine o f for all membranes before and after md are given in table 3 as can be seen the c f and o f ratios of all the membranes increased after md which is mainly due to organic fouling 25 after md the c f ratios of the membranes increased by 77 2 and 38 1 compared to clean membrane for the unpretreated produced water and treatment with 5 min using 5a respectively as can be seen the greatest increase in the c f ratio was for the membrane challenged with unpretreated produced water due to the adsorption of the unremoved organic species the membrane surface having the least organic foulants based on the c f ratio change is for produced water pretreated using ec run table 4 shows inorganic element atom percentages the inorganic foulants on the membrane could be strontium sulfate 53 this is confirmed here since 7 65 strontium was observed on the membrane surface for unpretreated produced water though strontium was not one of the major components in the produced water see table 2 this is probably due to relatively low solubility of strontium sulfate 53 however it seems ec can reduce strontium deposited on the membrane surface the results obtained here indicate that ec may be used as a pretreatment step prior to a unit operation like md given the complexity of the ec process determining suitable conditions for ec will be highly dependent on the feed water quality the aim here was to maximize removal of toc while ensuring that the floc settling characteristics were not adversely affected however the pretreatment goal will depend on the subsequent unit operation it is important to determine the pretreatment conditions in conjunction with the subsequent unit operation 5 conclusions hydraulic fracturing produced water was treated by ec with al electrodes fe electrodes and fe al electrodes sludge settling for ec conducted using fe electrodes is much faster than the sludge generated by al electrodes which is likely due to the different morphology of metal hydroxides the iron hydroxide particles were smaller and had a higher density at higher current al hydroxides with gel like structure were formed which had lower settling speed because of the higher hydraulic resistances from the larger lower density particles the highest toc removal efficiency of 42 was obtained for ec with 5 al electrodes at 5 a current and 5 min reaction time which greatly decreased the membrane fouling during md the results obtained here indicate that by considering the species present in the produced water the likely electrolysis reaction can be determined however ec is very complex as not only electrolysis reactions occur further successful ec will require effective flocculation and floc densification these processes depend on the water quality and the operating conditions by analyzing the floc properties one can determine the removal efficiency of these species which can easily foul the membrane during md it is essential to design the ec and subsequent md operations together in order to optimize the integrated process funding funding for this work was provided by the arkansas research alliance national science foundation through a industry university

12746,titanium nanotubes tnt are commonly synthesized from tio2 p25 under hydrothermal reaction htr using 10 m naoh composite adsorbents derived from tio2 and carbon spheres cs were synthesized via a facile two stage htr process cs was firstly synthesized from glucose through htr the mixture cs tio2 and naoh was then transferred to a teflon lined autoclave for another htc process to generate tnt cs the tnt cs composite was calcined from 300 to 800 c to evaluate the changes in its surface properties functional group morphology and external charge textural parameters crystallinity cation exchange capacity and adsorption capacity results indicated that the brunauer emmett teller surface area and total pore volume of composites were 25 0 131 9 m2 g and 0 099 0 33 cm3 g respectively the composites exhibited a negatively charged surface within ph 4 0 9 0 with their zeta potentials at ph 5 0 ranging from 54 60 to 31 1 mv the result of x ray photoelectron spectroscopy demonstrated that the main components atomic in the composites were carbon 29 07 60 75 oxygen 29 09 49 16 titanium 2 93 17 52 and sodium 0 56 9 48 during the preparation of tnt cs cs its negatively charged surface can well absorb na ions in the mixture this phenomenon prevented the performance of tubular morphology in tnt cs the synthesized composites were regarded as multifunctional adsorbents for adsorbing various contaminants pb2 cd2 cu2 cationic methylene blue dye phenol and toluene in water equilibrium adsorption at ph 5 0 was carried out to estimate their adsorption capacities toward the selected contaminants the langmuir maximum adsorption capacities of pb cd cu methylene blue phenol and toluene were 534 518 514 690 329 138 mg g for tnt cs and 334 523 384 477 297 453 394 677 303 416 118 260 mg g for the calcinated tnt cs composites and 26 3 23 8 21 4 285 239 188 mg g for commercial activated carbon respectively the adsorption mechanisms were elucidated based on the adsorption experiments and surface characteristics of tnt cs ion exchange was the primary adsorption mechanism for the test cationic contaminants the van der waals force was an important adsorption mechanism for phenol and toluene the developed tnt cs composite can be employed as an effective adsorbent for adsorbing cationic and non ionic contaminants in aqueous solutions graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords adsorption composite carbon sphere titanate nanotube titanium oxide water treatment data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction industrialization urbanization and population growth have resulted in the emergence of various contaminants potentially toxic metals dyes and emerging organic contaminants in water bodies these contaminants can negatively impact the environment and adversely affect human s health several methods have been developed to eliminate such contaminants 1 2 biological treatment is regarded as a low cost process however microorganisms cannot easily degrade several chemical substances such as heavy metals dyes and toxic compounds 3 meanwhile physicochemical treatment processes are often used for removing various contaminants because of its relatively low operational cost and high treatment efficiency 4 6 adsorption can be extensively employed to eliminate various contaminants i e heavy metal ions and organic compounds based on the surface properties of adsorbents for example zeolites and other minerals have been used to effectively adsorb heavy metal ions activated carbon and graphene oxide exhibited high adsorption affinities to organic compounds 7 zeolites modified by organic substances have also been used to adsorb organic contaminants 8 and heavy metal ions 9 however most adsorbents often effectively adsorb a given target of contaminants hence numerous researchers have attempted to develop composite adsorbents 10 14 the combination of two or more adsorbents permits the adsorption of multiple types of contaminants based on the characteristics of the two feedstock materials titanate nanotubes tnt are often synthesized from titanium dioxides i e tio2 p25 nanoparticles under a one step hydrothermal reaction using a high concentration of naoh i e 10 m at low temperatures such as 110 c 15 120 c 16 17 135 c 18 or 150 c 19 20 meanwhile titanate nanowires i e na2ti3o7 are also synthesized with the same alkaline hydrothermal procedure but different temperatures i e often 250 c 21 some authors converted the chemical forms of the titanate nanotubes or nanowires from na2ti3o7 to h2ti3o7 by treating them with hcl 16 21 tnt has garnered increasing interests because of its high specific surface area beneficial ion exchange property mainly from na or h and nanoscale structure this kind of nanomaterials has been reported as excellent adsorbents for adsorbing cationic organic dyes e g methylene blue mb dye 22 23 and basic fuchsin dye 16 and metal cations i e pb cd cu ti co and cr 22 24 26 bavykin et al 27 concluded that mb cations are more favourably adsorbed by the negatively charged surface of tnt than the positively charged surface of tio2 material however tnt had a low adsorption affinity to non ionic contaminants 19 28 the organic contaminants i e benzene toluene ethylbenzene and xylene can be classified as non ionic organic compounds that do not dissociate in any ph solutions 9 19 therefore some authors modified tnt with organic substances to increase its adsorption affinity and then used them to adsorb various organic contaminants 19 28 29 some composites based on tnt have been synthesized and applied for water treatment they included graphene titanate nanocomposite for adsorbing mb dye 30 reduced graphene oxide titanate nanotube nanocomposite for adsorbing mb dye 18 and activated carbon fiber titanate nanotube nanocomposite for adsorbing 2 chlorophenol and uranium vi 31 carbon spheres cs derived from saccharides like glucose and sucrose have been utilized in various industries cs also known as spherical hydrochar possesses rich active functional groups in the surface i e cooh and oh that can adequately uptake toxic metal ions in water 32 33 activated cs i e spherical biochar and spherical activated carbon offers a significant specific surface area high surface area and total pore volume and high aromatic property that are highly suitable for adsorbing organic compounds 34 36 some authors increased the adsorption capacity of cs by functionalizing its surface to amino groups using ammonia solution 37 or boronic acid 38 as well as modified its surface with triethylenetetramine 34 in addition several composites based on those materials spherical carbons have been developed and applied for water treatment dat et al 39 developed two composites one from layered doubled hydroxides and carbon spheres and another from layered doubled oxides and spherical biochar and applied them for adsorbing cationic mb and anionic congo red dye in water zhang et al 40 also reported that this composite ldh cs can well absorb various kinds of pollutants such as pb cd cu cr vi acid red 1 dye phenol and toluene liu et al 33 used commercial activated carbon cac and glucose to generate the composite of carbon spheres activated carbon through the hydrothermal carbonization htc method and applied it for adsorbing cr vi from water various methods have been used to fabricate cs carbon based materials 41 and tnt 24 25 particularly both tnt and cs can be synthesized via the hydrothermal method a similar synthetic procedure is great advantages for successfully generating composites in the present study tnt and cs were used to firstly synthesize composite adsorbents that can adsorb various contaminants lead cadmium copper mb dye and phenol especially non ionic contaminant i e toluene the hydrothermal method was employed to prepare the tnt cs composite notably the specific surface area s bet of cs is enhanced under high pyrolysis temperatures tran et al 42 reported that the s bet of cs increased from 7 08 m2 g to 13 8 118 220 536 544 and 677 m2 g when the pyrolysis temperatures increased to 300 400 500 600 700 800 c respectively in contrast the s bet of tnt tended to decrease within increasing calcination temperatures vijayan et al 17 investigated the change of textural parameters of tnt under different temperatures 200 300 400 500 600 700 and 800 c and found its highest s bet 230 m2 g reached at 200 c in general tnt is loaded on the surface of cs through predominantly physical forces under high calcination temperatures the s bet of cs can be improved but the stability of the composites and their important structures and properties might be affected the changes of some certain properties of tnt cs can form new materials denoted as the calcinated tnt cs composites therefore tnt cs was calcined at temperatures in the range of 300 800 c for evaluating those changes the tnt cs and calcinated tnt cs materials were utilized to adsorb pb cd cu methylene blue dye phenol and toluene from water the adsorption mechanisms were elucidated and the adsorption capacities of the tested contaminants were estimated through adsorption isotherms 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials all the chemicals used in this study i e tio2 p25 glucose sodium hydroxide 0 1 m hcl lead nitrate copper nitrate cadmium nitrate mb phenol toluene and carbon disulfide purities 95 were purchased from merck or sigma aldrich the tnt cs composite adsorbent was synthesized using a two stage hydrothermal process in the first stage cs was synthesized from glucose using the htc method cs was then added to the solution containing the chemicals tio2 and naoh used for producing tnt subsequently the hydrothermal method was performed to generate the tnt cs composite adsorbent fig 1 2 2 synthesis of carbon spheres cs carbon spheres were prepared by hydrothermal carbonization fig 1 in brief glucose 15 g was directly mixed with deionized distilled water 100 ml and stirred continuously for 15 min the mixture was subsequently transferred into a teflon lined autoclave and hydrothermal carbonization was performed at 190 c for 24 h subsequently the samples were collected and sequentially washed with 0 1 m hcl and deionized distilled water to remove any adhering dirt or impurities finally the samples were dried at 80 c in an oven for 24 h and the dried cs was ground and sieved to obtain particles with a size of 0 149 mm using a 100 mesh sieve notably the brown solid after htc is commonly known as spherical hydrochar a soft carbon material under high temperatures of pyrolysis spherical hydrochar is converted to spherical biochar a hard carbon material the sphere shaped morphology property of spherical hydrochar is not changed under high temperatures even 1200 c compared to the others i e textural properties 42 therefore in this study both spherical hydrochar and spherical biochar are generally called carbon spheres 2 3 synthesis of titanate nanotube carbon sphere adsorbent in our previous study chao et al 19 successfully synthesized tnt by a simple hydrothermal method the total volume of the teflon lined autoclave was 200 ml from a mixture of tio2 powder 6 g and naoh solution 10 m and 120 ml at 150 c for 24 h fig 1 43 in this study naoh 50 g was directly mixed with deionized distilled water 100 ml and stirred continuously for 15 min tio2 3 750 g was subsequently added to the mixture and stirred constantly for 15 min the mixture was dispersed into a mixture of the synthesized cs 9 375 g and deionized distilled water 100 ml and stirred for 1 h to obtain a homogeneous suspension the mixture was subsequently transferred to a teflon lined autoclave and subjected to hydrothermal carbonization at 190 c under a self generated pressure condition for 24 h the material was then naturally cooled to room temperature the samples were thoroughly washed with 0 1 m hcl to remove ash and inorganic salts finally deionized distilled water was used to wash the samples until the ph of the filtrates reached a constant level the samples were dried at 80 c in an oven for 24 h and then sieved to obtain particles with sizes of 0 149 mm using a 100 mesh sieve the samples were stored in tightly closed brown bottles and labeled tnt cs that is the uncalcined tnt cs composite fig 1 a calcination process under oxygen limited conditions at different temperatures from 300 to 800 c for 4 h in a covered porcelain crucible was conducted to perform the calcined tnt cs composites following the calcination the samples were thoroughly washed with 0 1 m hcl and deionized distilled water to remove any adhering dirt or impurities the samples were then dried at 80 c in an oven for 24 h and labeled 300 tnt cs 400 tnt cs 500 tnt cs 600 tnt cs 700 tnt cs and 800 tnt cs corresponding to the calcination temperatures of 300 400 500 600 700 and 800 c respectively fig 1 2 4 properties of the adsorbent morphological studies of the synthesized samples were performed using field emission scanning electron microscopy sem hitachi s 4800 japan x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps escalab 250 thermo scientific us was employed to determine the structure of the elements the surface chemistry and functional groups available on the surface of the sample were analyzed using fourier transform infrared ftir ft ir 6600 jasco spectroscopy x ray diffraction xrd patterns were used to determine the crystalline structure using the panalytical pw3040 60 x pert pro with cu kα radiation α 0 154 nm scanning was performed in the 2θ range of 5 2θ 60 and the scanning rate was 3 min the pore volume and surface area of the tnt cs composites were determined by the brunauer emmett teller bet method using a micromeritics asap 2020 sorptometer the surface charges of the adsorbents in the given ph solutions were measured using a zeta potential analyzer shimadzu zetasizer nano z 2 5 adsorption experiments adsorption processes were performed using batch experiments each experiment was duplicated and the bias of experiments exceeded 15 triplicate repetitions were made all experiments used a single adsorbate to prevent competitive adsorption the concentrations of pb ii cu ii cd ii mb dye and phenol ranged from approximately 10 to 1000 mg l whereas that of toluene ranged from 10 to 130 mg l owing to its low water solubility s w of 515 mg l approximately 0 02 g of each adsorbent was added to a low transparency teflon centrifuge tube containing 50 ml of the adsorbate the ph of the solutions except toluene was adjusted to 5 0 using naoh or hcl following which the solutions were shaken at 150 rpm at 25 c for 24 h a primary test indicated that the contact time of 24 h was enough for attaining adsorption equilibrium data not showed the solution ph 5 0 was selected for adsorption isotherms to avoid the precipitation of metals in the form of hydroxides i e cu in solution is often precipitated as cu oh 2 when ph 6 0 under low ph values the composites might be not stable because tnt is loaded on the surface of cs by mainly physical forces subsequently the solutions were filtered through a 0 2 μm filter the aliquots 10 ml of the supernatants were analyzed to determine the adsorbate concentration the concentrations of phenol and mb were measured using uv vis spectrophotometry genesys 10 uv vis at wavelengths of 265 and 665 nm respectively the concentrations of toxic metal ions including pb ii cu ii and cd ii were measured using atomic absorption spectrometry avanta aas gbc the toluene solutions were extracted with carbon disulfide at a volume ratio of 1 1 after centrifugation to prevent volatilization loss blank experiments without solids were performed in each batch experiment the aim was to attain recoveries 85 the solutions were then equilibrated for 24 h in a reciprocating shaker at 150 rpm the samples were subsequently analyzed using a gas chromatograph perkin elmer clarus 500 with a j w db 5 capillary column 30 0 53 mm id film thickness 3 mm the adsorption capacities of a commercial activated carbon cac toward the selected contaminants were examined under the same conditions cac with a specific surface area 1000 m2 g was purchased from merck safc 102555 the results were compared with those obtained for tnt cs the amount of each contaminant adsorbed by each composite upon attaining equilibrium is denoted by q e the adsorption amount q e mg g was calculated using the mass balance equation 1 q e c o c e m v where c o mg l and c e mg l are the concentrations of each adsorbate at beginning and equilibrium respectively m g is the dried mass of adsorbent used and v l is the volume of each adsorbate solution the langmuir eq 2 and freundlich eq 3 models were employed to describe the adsorptive behavior of the target adsorbates onto the tnt cs composites the two models have been frequently applied in previous studies because of their conducive parameters 8 24 34 44 45 2 q e q max k l c e 1 k l c e 3 q e k f c e 1 n where q e and c e are obtained from eq 1 q max mg g is the maximum adsorption capacity of each adsorbent k l l mg is the langmuir equilibrium constant and k f mg g mg l 1 n and n dimensionless are the freundlich constant 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of the synthesized materials 3 1 1 surface morphology the superficial morphologies of the tnt cs composites at various calcination temperatures and their precursors tnt and cs were observed via sem fig 2a shows that the cs sample has a spherical morphology carbonaceous microspheres which correlates with the literature 36 41 under the absence of cs tio2 p25 nano powders were successfully transformed into nanotubes using 10 m naoh solution through the hydrothermal method at 150 c fig 2b this process has been reported by some authors 16 19 20 28 in general the particle sizes of cs are much large than tnt so cs is defined as a carrier material tnt can be loaded in the surface of cs however under the presence of cs the composite tnt cs was performed with surface morphology fig 3a different to their feedstocks cs and tnt the surface morphology of tnt cs is similar to the literature 46 xiong et al 46 investigated the effect of na derived from naoh on the morphology of the resultant titanate nanotubes they found that under a low na content 1 70 its rod like morphology is similar to that of tnt cs in fig 3a therefore it can be concluded that the presence of cs in the mixture cs tio2 and naoh solution prevented the performance of nanowires or nanotubes shaped morphology tubular structure from the resultant tnt cs composite this is because cs its negatively charged surface see its zeta potentials can absorb a part of na ions in solution 34 nguyen and juang 18 also found that the presence of reduced graphene oxide in the mixture rgo tio2 and naoh solution inhibited the performance of tubular structure from the resultant composite if higher concentrations of naoh or possible higher temperatures are used the nanotubes shaped morphology might be observed in the resultant composites 30 the tnt cs composites exhibited a sphere like shape under the calcination temperatures of 300 500 c fig 3c d the shapes converted to rod like structures at high temperatures 600 800 c fig 3e g similarly vijayan et al 17 reported that the tubular morphology of tnt was not affected under calcination temperatures at 200 300 and 400 c however under higher temperatures the morphology of tnt was converted from nanotubes to nanorods when temperatures at 500 and 600 c and entirely collapsed into powders at 700 c the change of the morphology in three samples 600 tnt cs 700 tnt cs and 800 tnt cs might result from the change of their crystal structures 3 1 2 crystal structure the xrd technique was performed to determine the phase and structure of the composites for cs and tnt synthesized individually the diffraction peaks of the cs at the 2θ values of around 23 and 44 fig s1a indicated that cs prepared by hydrothermal carbonization was a typical amorphous carbon 42 meanwhile tio2 and tnt are crystal materials the starting tio2 powder p25 indicated a bi crystalline structure i e rutile and anatase phases fig 4a 2 20 the corrsesponding amounts of rutile eq 4 and anatase eq 5 in tio2 were determined by following documents 47 48 the calculating result fig 4a demonstrated that the tio2 p25 exhibited an anatase phase f a 77 5 more dominant than a rutile one f r 25 5 lópez zavala et al 15 reported that the commercial tio2 contained the anatase 88 and rutile 12 phases 4 f r 1 1 0 8 i a i r 100 5 f a 100 f r where f a and f r are the mass fraction of the anatase and rutile phases in the material i a and i r are the intensities of the crystal planes for the anatase phase 1 0 1 and rutile phase 1 1 0 respectively and the jcpds databases for the anatase tio2 card no 21 1272 and rutile tio2 card no 75 1755 were reported by kumar et al 47 the xrd patterns of tnt fig 4a indicated that its crystal nature a mono clinic phase was similar to those of other tnt samples fig s2 synthesized by the same method 15 19 20 an important peak at approximately 12 40 fig 4a confirmed the layered structure of the tnt s walls 20 meanwhile a peak at 48 19 suggested that the existence of the anatase phase minor quantity in the tio2 precursor 15 tnt is a layered material jcpds no 00 059 0666 and was performed via eq 6 the chemical formula of tnt na2ti3o7 can be converted to that of h2ti3o7 through an ion exchange with hcl eq 7 15 6 3 tio 2 2 naoh na 2 ti 3 o 7 h 2 o 7 na 2 ti 3 o 7 2 hcl h 2 ti 3 o 7 2 nacl although tnt was expected to be performed during the synthesis of the tnt cs composite the xrd data indicated an opposite outcome in fact the crystalline phases of tnt cs fig 4b were very similar to those of the tio2 powder fig 4a the mass fraction of the anatase phase f a 73 6 fig 4b in tnt cs still dominates compared to the rutile one f r 26 4 the result suggests that the typical layered structure of tnt was not performed under the presence of cs during the synthesis process fig 1 as expected this is well consistent with the sem data in fig 3 the rod like morphology of tnt cs fig 3 is similar to that of the tio2 powder fig s2b 20 and the composite of tio2 ac fig s2c d fig 4b 4c shows the effect of calcination temperature on the crystalline structure of the composites the result showed that the crystalline structure of the composite was not affected when the temperature was from 300 c to 500 c fig 4b the dominant anatase phase f a 68 9 78 2 was observed in the composites the change of the crystalline structure of the composite under higher temperatures i e 600 700 c fig 4c was consistent with the change of their surface morphology fig 3e f 3 1 3 elemental composition the elemental compositions of the prepared materials were analyzed using xps fig s3 shows the main elements of the synthesized composites the percentages of the main elements c o ti and na are listed in table 1 because the synthesis process required the addition of naoh to the system fig 1 a small amount of na was detected in the resultant materials other elements were necessary to prepare the tnt cs samples thus the result of the xps survey spectrum confirmed that the tnt cs composite was successfully synthesized when the calcination temperatures increased the o and ti contents increased whereas the c content decreased although the calcination reaction did not supply sufficient oxygen some residual oxygen in the system might have reacted with the content c in tnt cs oxygen may react with carbon to form carbon dioxide or other oxygen containing functional groups this leads to a reduced amount of carbon and an increased amount of oxygen moreover a slight weight loss occurs during calcination which leads to increasing the ti and na contents 3 1 4 surface functionality besides ion exchange ability the functional groups on the adsorbent s surface play a key role in determining the adsorption capacities of the composites the typical ftir spectra of the tnt cs composites uncalcined and calcined and their precursors tnt and cs are shown in figs 5 and s4 a broad band observed in tnt cs at 3410 cm 1 is attributed to the stretching of the hydroxyl groups in the oh phenolic group of cs or the tioh group of tnt 18 24 30 41 the presence of co and co groups derived from cs was confirmed at 1636 and 1048 cm 1 respectively 41 the aromatic rings cc double bonds from cs were observed at 1385 cm 1 36 finally a band at 580 cm 1 indicates the presence of tnt through tio bonds 24 25 30 therefore it can be concluded that the tnt cs composites exhibited the characteristics of the surface functional groups of their precursors tnt and cs the functional groups on the surface of the adsorbents can affect the adsorption mechanisms including ion exchange and complexation for metal ions 24 and hydrogen bonding interactions for organic ions the synthesized tnt cs composites were expected to effectively uptake the test contaminants through various adsorption mechanisms moreover the calcination temperature could influence positively or negatively the adsorption capacities of the adsorbents toward different contaminants the effect of the calcination temperature on the surface functional groups of the resulting composites is shown in fig s4 when the calcination temperatures were lower than 600 c the surface functional groups of the calcined composites 300 tnt cs 400 tnt cs 500 tnt cs and 600 tnt cs were similar to those of the uncalcined composite tnt cs however the opposite trend was observed for the samples calcined at 700 c 700 tnt cs and 800 c 800 tnt cs the changes in the surface functional groups of the two samples are consistent with those in their surface morphology fig 3 and their crystal nature fig 4 those changes can increase or decrease the adsorption capacities of the selected contaminants 3 1 5 textural property another important adsorption mechanism is pore filling it often plays an important role in the adsorption of organic contaminants and is closely related to the textural properties of the adsorbent table 2 lists the textural parameters of the uncalcined and calcined tnt cs composites our previous study reported the s bet of uncalcined cs 5 0 m2 g 34 and of tnt between 100 and 300 m2 g 19 24 43 similarly the s bet values of cs and tnt in this study table 2 were 3 22 and 99 9 m2 g respectively the s bet of 26 8 m2 g table 2 obtained for the un calcined tnt cs composite indicated that tnt cs exhibited the main textural property of tnt rather than cs fig s5 the s bet of tnt cs increased with increasing calcination temperatures when the calcination temperatures exceeded 500 c the s bet of tnt cs decreased with increasing temperatures this could be attributed to the micropore destruction that occurs at high temperatures the high calcination temperatures 500 c might lead to changing the surface morphology of the composites fig 1 adsorbents with high s bet values may favor the adsorption of organic contaminants in addition the pore size of the adsorbent could affect the adsorption of high molecular weight organic contaminants such as dyes based on their average pore sizes table 2 all samples were classified as mesopores the effect of the pore size on dye adsorption was less significant 3 1 6 external surface charge the zeta potential values of the synthesized adsorbents in various ph solutions are shown in fig 6 the magnitudes of the zeta potentials of tnt were lower than cs within ph from 4 0 to 9 0 suggesting the surface of cs exhibited a higher charge density than that of tnt all zeta potentials of the prepared materials in the given ph range were negative fig 6 duan et al 31 also reported that the zeta potentials of the tnt activated carbon fiber acf and acf tnt composite were negative within solutions ph from 3 0 to 10 this result represents the negative charge on the external surface of the adsorbents electrostatic attraction or ion exchange can be regarded as the primary adsorption mechanism for cu2 cd2 pb2 and cationic mb dye 3 2 adsorption equilibrium the adsorption isotherms for potential toxic metals pb cd and cu and organic contaminants mb phenol and toluene on the uncalcined and calcined tnt cs composites are presented in figs 7 and 8 respectively as expected all the curves exhibited a concave downward shape indicating a high affinity between the adsorbent and adsorbates the parameters of the two adsorption models langmuir and freundlich are presented in table s1 and s2 respectively based on the higher adjusted r 2 and lower reduced χ 2 values the adsorption equilibrium of the six adsorbates including toluene obtained by the prepared composites exhibited a greater conformance with the langmuir model adj r 2 0 956 0 9982 and red χ 2 4 502 1462 than with the freundlich model 0 9143 0 9924 and 47 5 5495 respectively the linear fittings of the langmuir model are showed in figs 7 and 8 and those of the freundlich model are showed in figs s6 and s7 therefore the q max the maximum adsorption capacity of the adsorbent for each adsorbate of the langmuir model was used for further discussion and analysis the effect of the calcination temperature 0 300 400 500 600 700 and 800 c on the adsorption capacities of the resultant composites toward toxic metals fig 7 and organic contaminants fig 8 was investigated using adsorption isotherms as expected the calcined tnt cs samples exhibited adsorption isotherm characteristics that were similar to those of the uncalcined tnt cs sample concave downward shape the results demonstrated that the calcined tnt cs composites maintained the main properties of the precursors tnt and cs however the calcination temperatures could alter the adsorption capacities of the tnt cs composites toward different contaminants to compare the adsorbing efficiencies of contaminants using the synthesized adsorbents the q max values of the test contaminants on the calcined and uncalcined tnt cs composites cs and cac are presented in table 3 cs with a low s bet could generate a high q max for the three toxic metals this was ascribed to the complexation reaction between the oxygen containing functional groups on the cs surface and heavy metals for organic compounds cs exhibited a low q max value because the van der waals interaction was weak in addition the q max of the composites toward the three toxic metals decreased significantly when the calcination temperature increased this indicated that the uncalcined tnt cs composite exhibited the highest q max values for metal ions cu2 pb2 and cd2 and mb cations in solution compared to the calcined tnt cs composites 300 tnt cs 400 tnt cs 500 tnt cs 600 tnt cs 700 tnt cs and 800 tnt cs this could be due to 1 a decrease in certain active functional groups on the surface of tnt cs fig s4 2 a decrease in exchangeable sites i e na ions on the tnt cs surface table 1 and 3 a change in the crystal structure especially for the 600 tnt cs 700 tnt cs and 800 tnt cs composites when calcination was performed at high temperatures fig 4 in contrast the composite prepared at a calcination temperature of 500 c 500 tnt cs exhibited the highest q max for the two organic adsorbates phenol and toluene this was because the 500 tnt cs composite had the highest bet surface area table 2 therefore the maximum adsorption capacities of phenol and toluene onto the tnt cs composites fig 8 were positively correlated with their bet surface areas table 2 the q max of the synthesized tnt cs was higher than that of cac except for toluene 400 tnt cs 500 tnt cs and 600 tnt cs could generate higher q max values than those generated by cac generally only low concentrations of toluene are present in wastewater therefore the tnt cs composites can be regarded as excellent adsorbents based on their ability to adsorb significant amounts of various contaminants furthermore the adsorption affinity of the composites toward the six adsorbates was remarkably different and strongly dependent on the nature of each adsorbate and the properties of each composite for example the q max values of tnt cs fig 9 decreased in the following order 8 09 mol kg cu 4 61 mol kg cd 3 50 mol kg phenol 2 58 mol kg pb 2 16 mol kg mb 1 50 mol kg toluene in contrast the q max of 600 tnt cs fig s8 decreased in the order of 5 44 mol kg cu 4 23 mol kg phenol 3 67 mol kg cd 2 21 mol kg toluene 2 02 mol kg pb 1 67 mol kg mb it is known that tnt possesses a high cation exchange capacity for the uptake of potentially toxic metal ions 24 49 50 and cationic dyes 4 27 tnt can adsorb phenol with a relatively higher polarity as confirmed by the concave downward shape of their adsorption isotherm fig s9 28 meanwhile cs can effectively adsorb toxic metal ions and cationic dyes through oxygen containing functional groups on their surfaces 34 in contrast tnt cannot directly adsorb toluene s w 515 mg l in water because the water molecules primarily occupy the surface of tnt fig s10 a linear adsorption isotherm 19 in addition the amount of toluene adsorbed on cs reportedly increased as s bet increased 36 as a result the tnt cs composite synthesized herein with the advantageous characteristics of both tnt and cs could effectively uptake the six contaminants in water in general the uncalcined tnt cs composite exhibited an excellent adsorption capacity for the six target contaminants in water compared to the other materials tested in this study table s1 and the literature table s3 therefore it was used for further investigation of the adsorption mechanisms 3 3 feasible adsorption mechanisms adsorption mechanisms between adsorbates and adsorbents are often complex the synthesized samples possessed a characteristic combination of tnt and cs as shown in table 2 tnt cs with the relatively lower s bet and v total values was not a porous material therefore the fraction of adsorption that occurred through pore filling was negligible compared to that in porous materials such as activated carbon 36 or porous covalent triazine frameworks 5 in essence the adsorption of metal ions i e cu cd and pb can generate surface precipitation in the form of carbonates i e cdco3 or hydroxides i e cd oh 2 45 similarly based on xrd results before and after adsorption liu et al 25 concluded that the adsorption process of thallium by tnt involved the co precipitation of tl oh 3 however the xrd patterns of tnt cs before and after the adsorption of metal ions fig 10a were nearly identical based on these results the surface precipitation mechanism was considered insignificant in this study a similar observation was made regarding the adsorption of organic contaminants fig 10b the similar xrd data for tnt cs before and after adsorption bavykin et al 27 also found that the xrd patterns of tnt before and after adsorbing mb dye were the same the results suggest that the adsorption processes did not affect the crystal characteristics of the tnt cs composite fig 5 shows that the ftir spectrum of the pristine tnt cs is identical to that of the tnt cs with adsorbates the intensity and wavenumber of some highlighted bands in the tnt cs composite before and after adsorption were similar this result was expected because the adsorption forces between the adsorbent and the adsorbate were relatively weak physical adsorption was dominant therefore it was difficult to identify the primary adsorption mechanism via the ftir spectroscopy the active na ions on the tnt cs structure can act as effective exchange sites for cationic metal ions and mb cations in the solution table 1 several reports have detailed this type of primary ion exchange mechanism 4 26 27 49 50 moreover the zeta potential measurements demonstrated that ion exchange is the primary adsorption mechanism for cationic contaminants in addition the oxygen containing functional groups on the surface of tnt cs can adsorb metal ions and mb dyes through common inner sphere surface complexation 22 50 51 and hydrogen bonding interaction 4 6 52 respectively tnt cs exhibited a higher adsorption capacity for cu than for cd and pb fig 9 because of the higher affinity of complexation between cu a transition metal and the oxygen functionalities on its surface 51 53 54 although electron donor acceptor interactions π π interactions have been reported as the main adsorption mechanism of aromatic pollutants i e mb phenol and toluene by carbonaceous materials i e biochar and activated carbon this interaction is less important for hydrochar because of the weak aromatic cc bonds in this material 6 52 the cs material in the tnt cs composite was defined as a hydrochar because it was prepared through the hydrothermal carbonization at 190 c section 2 2 or fig 1 therefore π π interactions played a minor role in the adsorption of mb phenol and toluene on the tnt cs composite phenol m w 94 g mol and toluene 92 g mol possess similar molecular weights however phenol exhibited a higher adsorption affinity for tnt cs than toluene fig 9 this could be because of the hydrophilic nature of phenol its water solubility of 75 000 mg l compared to that of toluene hydrophobic 515 mg l therefore the main adsorption mechanism of phenol hydrophilic interaction and toluene hydrophobic interaction was van der waals force 55 56 such a force has been identified for mb adsorption by hydrochar 6 52 each phenol molecule containing one hydroxyl group can be adsorbed by the surface oxygen functionality of tnt cs through a hydrogen bonding mechanism 34 57 in summary the synthesized tnt cs composite can uptake cationic heavy metals cationic dyes and high polar and relatively low polar organic molecules the major adsorption mechanisms for the six adsorbates differed with the properties of the tnt and cs precursors the adsorption of potentially toxic metals cu cd and pb by tnt cs mainly occurred through ion exchange and complexation the ion exchange van der waals forces and hydrogen bonding interactions played important roles in the adsorption of mb by tnt cs compared to the π π interactions the primary mechanisms for phenol adsorption were van der waals forces and hydrogen bonding interactions with a minor contribution from the π π interactions in the case of toluene the primary mechanism was the van der waals force minor π π contribution 4 conclusions the new composite adsorbent tnt cs was firstly synthesized with the combined characteristics of titanate nanotube tnt and carbon sphere cs to enable the adsorption of different kinds of contaminants including pb ii cd ii cu ii mb dye phenol and especially toluene the calcination temperatures had great effects on the properties chemical thermal stability surface functional group surface morphology textural parameters surface charge crystallinity and cation exchange capacity and adsorption capacity of the resultant composites adsorption isotherms at ph 5 0 were investigated to estimate the maximum adsorption capacity q max of the materials through the langmuir model the q max values of tnt cs 534 518 514 2 690 and 329 mg g to pb cd cu mb dye and phenol were overwhelmingly higher than those of available commercial activated carbon 26 3 23 8 21 4 285 239 mg g respectively the q max values of tnt cs calcinated from 300 c to 800 c were in the range of 334 523 mg g for adsorbing pb 384 477 mg g for cd 297 453 mg g for cu 394 677 mg g for mb dye 303 416 mg g for phenol and 118 260 mg g for toluene both tnt cs and calcinated tnt cs composites exhibited an excellent adsorption capacity compared to cac the primary adsorption mechanism for the test cationic contaminants was electrostatic attraction and ion exchange the primary adsorption mechanism for phenol and toluene was van der waals interaction the synthesized composite adsorbents could uptake both cationic and non ionic organic contaminants hence they are promising to significantly simplify wastewater

12746,titanium nanotubes tnt are commonly synthesized from tio2 p25 under hydrothermal reaction htr using 10 m naoh composite adsorbents derived from tio2 and carbon spheres cs were synthesized via a facile two stage htr process cs was firstly synthesized from glucose through htr the mixture cs tio2 and naoh was then transferred to a teflon lined autoclave for another htc process to generate tnt cs the tnt cs composite was calcined from 300 to 800 c to evaluate the changes in its surface properties functional group morphology and external charge textural parameters crystallinity cation exchange capacity and adsorption capacity results indicated that the brunauer emmett teller surface area and total pore volume of composites were 25 0 131 9 m2 g and 0 099 0 33 cm3 g respectively the composites exhibited a negatively charged surface within ph 4 0 9 0 with their zeta potentials at ph 5 0 ranging from 54 60 to 31 1 mv the result of x ray photoelectron spectroscopy demonstrated that the main components atomic in the composites were carbon 29 07 60 75 oxygen 29 09 49 16 titanium 2 93 17 52 and sodium 0 56 9 48 during the preparation of tnt cs cs its negatively charged surface can well absorb na ions in the mixture this phenomenon prevented the performance of tubular morphology in tnt cs the synthesized composites were regarded as multifunctional adsorbents for adsorbing various contaminants pb2 cd2 cu2 cationic methylene blue dye phenol and toluene in water equilibrium adsorption at ph 5 0 was carried out to estimate their adsorption capacities toward the selected contaminants the langmuir maximum adsorption capacities of pb cd cu methylene blue phenol and toluene were 534 518 514 690 329 138 mg g for tnt cs and 334 523 384 477 297 453 394 677 303 416 118 260 mg g for the calcinated tnt cs composites and 26 3 23 8 21 4 285 239 188 mg g for commercial activated carbon respectively the adsorption mechanisms were elucidated based on the adsorption experiments and surface characteristics of tnt cs ion exchange was the primary adsorption mechanism for the test cationic contaminants the van der waals force was an important adsorption mechanism for phenol and toluene the developed tnt cs composite can be employed as an effective adsorbent for adsorbing cationic and non ionic contaminants in aqueous solutions graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords adsorption composite carbon sphere titanate nanotube titanium oxide water treatment data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction industrialization urbanization and population growth have resulted in the emergence of various contaminants potentially toxic metals dyes and emerging organic contaminants in water bodies these contaminants can negatively impact the environment and adversely affect human s health several methods have been developed to eliminate such contaminants 1 2 biological treatment is regarded as a low cost process however microorganisms cannot easily degrade several chemical substances such as heavy metals dyes and toxic compounds 3 meanwhile physicochemical treatment processes are often used for removing various contaminants because of its relatively low operational cost and high treatment efficiency 4 6 adsorption can be extensively employed to eliminate various contaminants i e heavy metal ions and organic compounds based on the surface properties of adsorbents for example zeolites and other minerals have been used to effectively adsorb heavy metal ions activated carbon and graphene oxide exhibited high adsorption affinities to organic compounds 7 zeolites modified by organic substances have also been used to adsorb organic contaminants 8 and heavy metal ions 9 however most adsorbents often effectively adsorb a given target of contaminants hence numerous researchers have attempted to develop composite adsorbents 10 14 the combination of two or more adsorbents permits the adsorption of multiple types of contaminants based on the characteristics of the two feedstock materials titanate nanotubes tnt are often synthesized from titanium dioxides i e tio2 p25 nanoparticles under a one step hydrothermal reaction using a high concentration of naoh i e 10 m at low temperatures such as 110 c 15 120 c 16 17 135 c 18 or 150 c 19 20 meanwhile titanate nanowires i e na2ti3o7 are also synthesized with the same alkaline hydrothermal procedure but different temperatures i e often 250 c 21 some authors converted the chemical forms of the titanate nanotubes or nanowires from na2ti3o7 to h2ti3o7 by treating them with hcl 16 21 tnt has garnered increasing interests because of its high specific surface area beneficial ion exchange property mainly from na or h and nanoscale structure this kind of nanomaterials has been reported as excellent adsorbents for adsorbing cationic organic dyes e g methylene blue mb dye 22 23 and basic fuchsin dye 16 and metal cations i e pb cd cu ti co and cr 22 24 26 bavykin et al 27 concluded that mb cations are more favourably adsorbed by the negatively charged surface of tnt than the positively charged surface of tio2 material however tnt had a low adsorption affinity to non ionic contaminants 19 28 the organic contaminants i e benzene toluene ethylbenzene and xylene can be classified as non ionic organic compounds that do not dissociate in any ph solutions 9 19 therefore some authors modified tnt with organic substances to increase its adsorption affinity and then used them to adsorb various organic contaminants 19 28 29 some composites based on tnt have been synthesized and applied for water treatment they included graphene titanate nanocomposite for adsorbing mb dye 30 reduced graphene oxide titanate nanotube nanocomposite for adsorbing mb dye 18 and activated carbon fiber titanate nanotube nanocomposite for adsorbing 2 chlorophenol and uranium vi 31 carbon spheres cs derived from saccharides like glucose and sucrose have been utilized in various industries cs also known as spherical hydrochar possesses rich active functional groups in the surface i e cooh and oh that can adequately uptake toxic metal ions in water 32 33 activated cs i e spherical biochar and spherical activated carbon offers a significant specific surface area high surface area and total pore volume and high aromatic property that are highly suitable for adsorbing organic compounds 34 36 some authors increased the adsorption capacity of cs by functionalizing its surface to amino groups using ammonia solution 37 or boronic acid 38 as well as modified its surface with triethylenetetramine 34 in addition several composites based on those materials spherical carbons have been developed and applied for water treatment dat et al 39 developed two composites one from layered doubled hydroxides and carbon spheres and another from layered doubled oxides and spherical biochar and applied them for adsorbing cationic mb and anionic congo red dye in water zhang et al 40 also reported that this composite ldh cs can well absorb various kinds of pollutants such as pb cd cu cr vi acid red 1 dye phenol and toluene liu et al 33 used commercial activated carbon cac and glucose to generate the composite of carbon spheres activated carbon through the hydrothermal carbonization htc method and applied it for adsorbing cr vi from water various methods have been used to fabricate cs carbon based materials 41 and tnt 24 25 particularly both tnt and cs can be synthesized via the hydrothermal method a similar synthetic procedure is great advantages for successfully generating composites in the present study tnt and cs were used to firstly synthesize composite adsorbents that can adsorb various contaminants lead cadmium copper mb dye and phenol especially non ionic contaminant i e toluene the hydrothermal method was employed to prepare the tnt cs composite notably the specific surface area s bet of cs is enhanced under high pyrolysis temperatures tran et al 42 reported that the s bet of cs increased from 7 08 m2 g to 13 8 118 220 536 544 and 677 m2 g when the pyrolysis temperatures increased to 300 400 500 600 700 800 c respectively in contrast the s bet of tnt tended to decrease within increasing calcination temperatures vijayan et al 17 investigated the change of textural parameters of tnt under different temperatures 200 300 400 500 600 700 and 800 c and found its highest s bet 230 m2 g reached at 200 c in general tnt is loaded on the surface of cs through predominantly physical forces under high calcination temperatures the s bet of cs can be improved but the stability of the composites and their important structures and properties might be affected the changes of some certain properties of tnt cs can form new materials denoted as the calcinated tnt cs composites therefore tnt cs was calcined at temperatures in the range of 300 800 c for evaluating those changes the tnt cs and calcinated tnt cs materials were utilized to adsorb pb cd cu methylene blue dye phenol and toluene from water the adsorption mechanisms were elucidated and the adsorption capacities of the tested contaminants were estimated through adsorption isotherms 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials all the chemicals used in this study i e tio2 p25 glucose sodium hydroxide 0 1 m hcl lead nitrate copper nitrate cadmium nitrate mb phenol toluene and carbon disulfide purities 95 were purchased from merck or sigma aldrich the tnt cs composite adsorbent was synthesized using a two stage hydrothermal process in the first stage cs was synthesized from glucose using the htc method cs was then added to the solution containing the chemicals tio2 and naoh used for producing tnt subsequently the hydrothermal method was performed to generate the tnt cs composite adsorbent fig 1 2 2 synthesis of carbon spheres cs carbon spheres were prepared by hydrothermal carbonization fig 1 in brief glucose 15 g was directly mixed with deionized distilled water 100 ml and stirred continuously for 15 min the mixture was subsequently transferred into a teflon lined autoclave and hydrothermal carbonization was performed at 190 c for 24 h subsequently the samples were collected and sequentially washed with 0 1 m hcl and deionized distilled water to remove any adhering dirt or impurities finally the samples were dried at 80 c in an oven for 24 h and the dried cs was ground and sieved to obtain particles with a size of 0 149 mm using a 100 mesh sieve notably the brown solid after htc is commonly known as spherical hydrochar a soft carbon material under high temperatures of pyrolysis spherical hydrochar is converted to spherical biochar a hard carbon material the sphere shaped morphology property of spherical hydrochar is not changed under high temperatures even 1200 c compared to the others i e textural properties 42 therefore in this study both spherical hydrochar and spherical biochar are generally called carbon spheres 2 3 synthesis of titanate nanotube carbon sphere adsorbent in our previous study chao et al 19 successfully synthesized tnt by a simple hydrothermal method the total volume of the teflon lined autoclave was 200 ml from a mixture of tio2 powder 6 g and naoh solution 10 m and 120 ml at 150 c for 24 h fig 1 43 in this study naoh 50 g was directly mixed with deionized distilled water 100 ml and stirred continuously for 15 min tio2 3 750 g was subsequently added to the mixture and stirred constantly for 15 min the mixture was dispersed into a mixture of the synthesized cs 9 375 g and deionized distilled water 100 ml and stirred for 1 h to obtain a homogeneous suspension the mixture was subsequently transferred to a teflon lined autoclave and subjected to hydrothermal carbonization at 190 c under a self generated pressure condition for 24 h the material was then naturally cooled to room temperature the samples were thoroughly washed with 0 1 m hcl to remove ash and inorganic salts finally deionized distilled water was used to wash the samples until the ph of the filtrates reached a constant level the samples were dried at 80 c in an oven for 24 h and then sieved to obtain particles with sizes of 0 149 mm using a 100 mesh sieve the samples were stored in tightly closed brown bottles and labeled tnt cs that is the uncalcined tnt cs composite fig 1 a calcination process under oxygen limited conditions at different temperatures from 300 to 800 c for 4 h in a covered porcelain crucible was conducted to perform the calcined tnt cs composites following the calcination the samples were thoroughly washed with 0 1 m hcl and deionized distilled water to remove any adhering dirt or impurities the samples were then dried at 80 c in an oven for 24 h and labeled 300 tnt cs 400 tnt cs 500 tnt cs 600 tnt cs 700 tnt cs and 800 tnt cs corresponding to the calcination temperatures of 300 400 500 600 700 and 800 c respectively fig 1 2 4 properties of the adsorbent morphological studies of the synthesized samples were performed using field emission scanning electron microscopy sem hitachi s 4800 japan x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps escalab 250 thermo scientific us was employed to determine the structure of the elements the surface chemistry and functional groups available on the surface of the sample were analyzed using fourier transform infrared ftir ft ir 6600 jasco spectroscopy x ray diffraction xrd patterns were used to determine the crystalline structure using the panalytical pw3040 60 x pert pro with cu kα radiation α 0 154 nm scanning was performed in the 2θ range of 5 2θ 60 and the scanning rate was 3 min the pore volume and surface area of the tnt cs composites were determined by the brunauer emmett teller bet method using a micromeritics asap 2020 sorptometer the surface charges of the adsorbents in the given ph solutions were measured using a zeta potential analyzer shimadzu zetasizer nano z 2 5 adsorption experiments adsorption processes were performed using batch experiments each experiment was duplicated and the bias of experiments exceeded 15 triplicate repetitions were made all experiments used a single adsorbate to prevent competitive adsorption the concentrations of pb ii cu ii cd ii mb dye and phenol ranged from approximately 10 to 1000 mg l whereas that of toluene ranged from 10 to 130 mg l owing to its low water solubility s w of 515 mg l approximately 0 02 g of each adsorbent was added to a low transparency teflon centrifuge tube containing 50 ml of the adsorbate the ph of the solutions except toluene was adjusted to 5 0 using naoh or hcl following which the solutions were shaken at 150 rpm at 25 c for 24 h a primary test indicated that the contact time of 24 h was enough for attaining adsorption equilibrium data not showed the solution ph 5 0 was selected for adsorption isotherms to avoid the precipitation of metals in the form of hydroxides i e cu in solution is often precipitated as cu oh 2 when ph 6 0 under low ph values the composites might be not stable because tnt is loaded on the surface of cs by mainly physical forces subsequently the solutions were filtered through a 0 2 μm filter the aliquots 10 ml of the supernatants were analyzed to determine the adsorbate concentration the concentrations of phenol and mb were measured using uv vis spectrophotometry genesys 10 uv vis at wavelengths of 265 and 665 nm respectively the concentrations of toxic metal ions including pb ii cu ii and cd ii were measured using atomic absorption spectrometry avanta aas gbc the toluene solutions were extracted with carbon disulfide at a volume ratio of 1 1 after centrifugation to prevent volatilization loss blank experiments without solids were performed in each batch experiment the aim was to attain recoveries 85 the solutions were then equilibrated for 24 h in a reciprocating shaker at 150 rpm the samples were subsequently analyzed using a gas chromatograph perkin elmer clarus 500 with a j w db 5 capillary column 30 0 53 mm id film thickness 3 mm the adsorption capacities of a commercial activated carbon cac toward the selected contaminants were examined under the same conditions cac with a specific surface area 1000 m2 g was purchased from merck safc 102555 the results were compared with those obtained for tnt cs the amount of each contaminant adsorbed by each composite upon attaining equilibrium is denoted by q e the adsorption amount q e mg g was calculated using the mass balance equation 1 q e c o c e m v where c o mg l and c e mg l are the concentrations of each adsorbate at beginning and equilibrium respectively m g is the dried mass of adsorbent used and v l is the volume of each adsorbate solution the langmuir eq 2 and freundlich eq 3 models were employed to describe the adsorptive behavior of the target adsorbates onto the tnt cs composites the two models have been frequently applied in previous studies

adsorbent k l l mg is the langmuir equilibrium constant and k f mg g mg l 1 n and n dimensionless are the freundlich constant 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of the synthesized materials 3 1 1 surface morphology the superficial morphologies of the tnt cs composites at various calcination temperatures and their precursors tnt and cs were observed via sem fig 2a shows that the cs sample has a spherical morphology carbonaceous microspheres which correlates with the literature 36 41 under the absence of cs tio2 p25 nano powders were successfully transformed into nanotubes using 10 m naoh solution through the hydrothermal method at 150 c fig 2b this process has been reported by some authors 16 19 20 28 in general the particle sizes of cs are much large than tnt so cs is defined as a carrier material tnt can be loaded in the surface of cs however under the presence of cs the composite tnt cs was performed with surface morphology fig 3a different to their feedstocks cs and tnt the surface morphology of tnt cs is similar to the literature 46 xiong et al 46 investigated the effect of na derived from naoh on the morphology of the resultant titanate nanotubes they found that under a low na content 1 70 its rod like morphology is similar to that of tnt cs in fig 3a therefore it can be concluded that the presence of cs in the mixture cs tio2 and naoh solution prevented the performance of nanowires or nanotubes shaped morphology tubular structure from the resultant tnt cs composite this is because cs its negatively charged surface see its zeta potentials can absorb a part of na ions in solution 34 nguyen and juang 18 also found that the presence of reduced graphene oxide in the mixture rgo tio2 and naoh solution inhibited the performance of tubular structure from the resultant composite if higher concentrations of naoh or possible higher temperatures are used the nanotubes shaped morphology might be observed in the resultant composites 30 the tnt cs composites exhibited a sphere like shape under the calcination temperatures of 300 500 c fig 3c d the shapes converted to rod like structures at high temperatures 600 800 c fig 3e g similarly vijayan et al 17 reported that the tubular morphology of tnt was not affected under calcination temperatures at 200 300 and 400 c however under higher temperatures the morphology of tnt was converted from nanotubes to nanorods when temperatures at 500 and 600 c and entirely collapsed into powders at 700 c the change of the morphology in three samples 600 tnt cs 700 tnt cs and 800 tnt cs might result from the change of their crystal structures 3 1 2 crystal structure the xrd technique was performed to determine the phase and structure of the composites for cs and tnt synthesized individually the diffraction peaks of the cs at the 2θ values of around 23 and 44 fig s1a indicated that cs prepared by hydrothermal carbonization was a typical amorphous carbon 42 meanwhile tio2 and tnt are crystal materials the starting tio2 powder p25 indicated a bi crystalline structure i e rutile and anatase phases fig 4a 2 20 the corrsesponding amounts of rutile eq 4 and anatase eq 5 in tio2 were determined by following documents 47 48 the calculating result fig 4a demonstrated that the tio2 p25 exhibited an anatase phase f a 77 5 more dominant than a rutile one f r 25 5 lópez zavala et al 15 reported that the commercial tio2 contained the anatase 88 and rutile 12 phases 4 f r 1 1 0 8 i a i r 100 5 f a 100 f r where f a and f r are the mass fraction of the anatase and rutile phases in the material i a and i r are the intensities of the crystal planes for the anatase phase 1 0 1 and rutile phase 1 1 0 respectively and the jcpds databases for the anatase tio2 card no 21 1272 and rutile tio2 card no 75 1755 were reported by kumar et al 47 the xrd patterns of tnt fig 4a indicated that its crystal nature a mono clinic phase was similar to those of other tnt samples fig s2 synthesized by the same method 15 19 20 an important peak at approximately 12 40 fig 4a confirmed the layered structure of the tnt s walls 20 meanwhile a peak at 48 19 suggested that the existence of the anatase phase minor quantity in the tio2 precursor 15 tnt is a layered material jcpds no 00 059 0666 and was performed via eq 6 the chemical formula of tnt na2ti3o7 can be converted to that of h2ti3o7 through an ion exchange with hcl eq 7 15 6 3 tio 2 2 naoh na 2 ti 3 o 7 h 2 o 7 na 2 ti 3 o 7 2 hcl h 2 ti 3 o 7 2 nacl although tnt was expected to be performed during the synthesis of the tnt cs composite the xrd data indicated an opposite outcome in fact the crystalline phases of tnt cs fig 4b were very similar to those of the tio2 powder fig 4a the mass fraction of the anatase phase f a 73 6 fig 4b in tnt cs still dominates compared to the rutile one f r 26 4 the result suggests that the typical layered structure of tnt was not performed under the presence of cs during the synthesis process fig 1 as expected this is well consistent with the sem data in fig 3 the rod like morphology of tnt cs fig 3 is similar to that of the tio2 powder fig s2b 20 and the composite of tio2 ac fig s2c d fig 4b 4c shows the effect of calcination temperature on the crystalline structure of the composites the result showed that the crystalline structure of the composite was not affected when the temperature was from 300 c to 500 c fig 4b the dominant anatase phase f a 68 9 78 2 was observed in the composites the change of the crystalline structure of the composite under higher temperatures i e 600 700 c fig 4c was consistent with the change of their surface morphology fig 3e f 3 1 3 elemental composition the elemental compositions of the prepared materials were analyzed using xps fig s3 shows the main elements of the synthesized composites the percentages of the main elements c o ti and na are listed in table 1 because the synthesis process required the addition of naoh to the system fig 1 a small amount of na was detected in the resultant materials other elements were necessary to prepare the tnt cs samples thus the result of the xps survey spectrum confirmed that the tnt cs composite was successfully synthesized when the calcination temperatures increased the o and ti contents increased whereas the c content decreased although the calcination reaction did not supply sufficient oxygen some residual oxygen in the system might have reacted with the content c in tnt cs oxygen may react with carbon to form carbon dioxide or other oxygen containing functional groups this leads to a reduced amount of carbon and an increased amount of oxygen moreover a slight weight loss occurs during calcination which leads to increasing the ti and na contents 3 1 4 surface functionality besides ion exchange ability the functional groups on the adsorbent s surface play a key role in determining the adsorption capacities of the composites the typical ftir spectra of the tnt cs composites uncalcined and calcined and their precursors tnt and cs are shown in figs 5 and s4 a broad band observed in tnt cs at 3410 cm 1 is attributed to the stretching of the hydroxyl groups in the oh phenolic group of cs or the tioh group of tnt 18 24 30 41 the presence of co and co groups derived from cs was confirmed at 1636 and 1048 cm 1 respectively 41 the aromatic rings cc double bonds from cs were observed at 1385 cm 1 36 finally a band at 580 cm 1 indicates the presence of tnt through tio bonds 24 25 30 therefore it can be concluded that the tnt cs composites exhibited the characteristics of the surface functional groups of their precursors tnt and cs the functional groups on the surface of the adsorbents can affect the adsorption mechanisms including ion exchange and complexation for metal ions 24 and hydrogen bonding interactions for organic ions the synthesized tnt cs composites were expected to effectively uptake the test contaminants through various adsorption mechanisms moreover the calcination temperature could influence positively or negatively the adsorption capacities of the adsorbents toward different contaminants the effect of the calcination temperature on the surface functional groups of the resulting composites is shown in fig s4 when the calcination temperatures were lower than 600 c the surface functional groups of the calcined composites 300 tnt cs 400 tnt cs 500 tnt cs and 600 tnt cs were similar to those of the uncalcined composite tnt cs however the opposite trend was observed for the samples calcined at 700 c 700 tnt cs and 800 c 800 tnt cs the changes in the surface functional groups of the two samples are consistent with those in their surface morphology fig 3 and their crystal nature fig 4 those changes can increase or decrease the adsorption capacities of the selected contaminants 3 1 5 textural property another important adsorption mechanism is pore filling it often plays an important role in the adsorption of organic contaminants and is closely related to the textural properties of the adsorbent table 2 lists the textural parameters of the uncalcined and calcined tnt cs composites our previous study reported the s bet of uncalcined cs 5 0 m2 g 34 and of tnt between 100 and 300 m2 g 19 24 43 similarly the s bet values of cs and tnt in this study table 2 were 3 22 and 99 9 m2 g respectively the s bet of 26 8 m2 g table 2 obtained for the un calcined tnt cs composite indicated that tnt cs exhibited the main textural property of tnt rather than cs fig s5 the s bet of tnt cs increased with increasing calcination temperatures when the calcination temperatures exceeded 500 c the s bet of tnt cs decreased with increasing temperatures this could be attributed to the micropore destruction that occurs at high temperatures the high calcination temperatures 500 c might lead to changing the surface morphology of the composites fig 1 adsorbents with high s bet values may favor the adsorption of organic contaminants in addition the pore size of the adsorbent could affect the adsorption of high molecular weight organic contaminants such as dyes based on their average pore sizes table 2 all samples were classified as mesopores the effect of the pore size on dye adsorption was less significant 3 1 6 external surface charge the zeta potential values of the synthesized adsorbents in various ph solutions are shown in fig 6 the magnitudes of the zeta potentials of tnt were lower than cs within ph from 4 0 to 9 0 suggesting the surface of cs exhibited a higher charge density than that of tnt all zeta potentials of the prepared materials in the given ph range were negative fig 6 duan et al 31 also reported that the zeta potentials of the tnt activated carbon fiber acf and acf tnt composite were negative within solutions ph from 3 0 to 10 this result represents the negative charge on the external surface of the adsorbents electrostatic attraction or ion exchange can be regarded as the primary adsorption mechanism for cu2 cd2 pb2 and cationic mb dye 3 2 adsorption equilibrium the adsorption isotherms for potential toxic metals pb cd and cu and organic contaminants mb phenol and toluene on the uncalcined and calcined tnt cs composites are presented in figs 7 and 8 respectively as expected all the curves exhibited a concave downward shape indicating a high affinity between the adsorbent and adsorbates the parameters of the two adsorption models langmuir and freundlich are presented in table s1 and s2 respectively based on the higher adjusted r 2 and lower reduced χ 2 values the adsorption equilibrium of the six adsorbates including toluene obtained by the prepared composites exhibited a greater conformance with the langmuir model adj r 2 0 956 0 9982 and red χ 2 4 502 1462 than with the freundlich model 0 9143 0 9924 and 47 5 5495 respectively the linear fittings of the langmuir model are showed in figs 7 and 8 and those of the freundlich model are showed in figs s6 and s7 therefore the q max the maximum adsorption capacity of the adsorbent for each adsorbate of the langmuir model was used for further discussion and analysis the effect of the calcination temperature 0 300 400 500 600 700 and 800 c on the adsorption capacities of the resultant composites toward toxic metals fig 7 and organic contaminants fig 8 was investigated using adsorption isotherms as expected the calcined tnt cs samples exhibited adsorption isotherm characteristics that were similar to those of the uncalcined tnt cs sample concave downward shape the results demonstrated that the calcined tnt cs composites maintained the main properties of the precursors tnt and cs however the calcination temperatures could alter the adsorption capacities of the tnt cs composites toward different contaminants to compare the adsorbing efficiencies of contaminants using the synthesized adsorbents the q max values of the test contaminants on the calcined and uncalcined tnt cs composites cs and cac are presented in table 3 cs with a low s bet could generate a high q max for the three toxic metals this was ascribed to the complexation reaction between the oxygen containing functional groups on the cs surface and heavy metals for organic compounds cs exhibited a low q max value because the van der waals interaction was weak in addition the q max of the composites toward the three toxic metals decreased significantly when the calcination temperature increased this indicated that the uncalcined tnt cs composite exhibited the highest q max values for metal ions cu2 pb2 and cd2 and mb cations in solution compared to the calcined tnt cs composites 300 tnt cs 400 tnt cs 500 tnt cs 600 tnt cs 700 tnt cs and 800 tnt cs this could be due to 1 a decrease in certain active functional groups on the surface of tnt cs fig s4 2 a decrease in exchangeable sites i e na ions on the tnt cs surface table 1 and 3 a change in the crystal structure especially for the 600 tnt cs 700 tnt cs and 800 tnt cs composites when calcination was performed at high temperatures fig 4 in contrast the composite prepared at a calcination temperature of 500 c 500 tnt cs exhibited the highest q max for the two organic adsorbates phenol and toluene this was because the 500 tnt cs composite had the highest bet surface area table 2 therefore the maximum adsorption capacities of phenol and toluene onto the tnt cs composites fig 8 were positively correlated with their bet surface areas table 2 the q max of the synthesized tnt cs was higher than that of cac except for toluene 400 tnt cs 500 tnt cs and 600 tnt cs could generate higher q max values than those generated by cac generally only low concentrations of toluene are present in wastewater therefore the tnt cs composites can be regarded as excellent adsorbents based on their ability to adsorb significant amounts of various contaminants furthermore the adsorption affinity of the composites toward the six adsorbates was remarkably different and strongly dependent on the nature of each adsorbate and the properties of each composite for example the q max values of tnt cs fig 9 decreased in the following order 8 09 mol kg cu 4 61 mol kg cd 3 50 mol kg phenol 2 58 mol kg pb 2 16 mol kg mb 1 50 mol kg toluene in contrast the q max of 600 tnt cs fig s8 decreased in the order of 5 44 mol kg cu 4 23 mol kg phenol 3 67 mol kg cd 2 21 mol kg toluene 2 02 mol kg pb 1 67 mol kg mb it is known that tnt possesses a high cation exchange capacity for the uptake of potentially toxic metal ions 24 49 50 and cationic dyes 4 27 tnt can adsorb phenol with a relatively higher polarity as confirmed by the concave downward shape of their adsorption isotherm fig s9 28 meanwhile cs can effectively adsorb toxic metal ions and cationic dyes through oxygen containing functional groups on their surfaces 34 in contrast tnt cannot directly adsorb toluene s w 515 mg l in water because the water molecules primarily occupy the surface of tnt fig s10 a linear adsorption isotherm 19 in addition the amount of toluene adsorbed on cs reportedly increased as s bet increased 36 as a result the tnt cs composite synthesized herein with the advantageous characteristics of both tnt and cs could effectively uptake the six contaminants in water in general the uncalcined tnt cs composite exhibited an excellent adsorption capacity for the six target contaminants in water compared to the other materials tested in this study table s1 and the literature table s3 therefore it was used for further investigation of the adsorption mechanisms 3 3 feasible adsorption mechanisms adsorption mechanisms between adsorbates and adsorbents are often complex the synthesized samples possessed a characteristic combination of tnt and cs as shown in table 2 tnt cs with the relatively lower s bet and v total values was not a porous material therefore the fraction of adsorption that occurred through pore filling was negligible compared to that in porous materials such as activated carbon 36 or porous covalent triazine frameworks 5 in essence the adsorption of metal ions i e cu cd and pb can generate surface precipitation in the form of carbonates i e cdco3 or hydroxides i e cd oh 2 45 similarly based on xrd results before and after adsorption liu et al 25 concluded that the adsorption process of thallium by tnt involved the co precipitation of tl oh 3 however the xrd patterns of tnt cs before and after the adsorption of metal ions fig 10a were nearly identical based on these results the surface precipitation mechanism was considered insignificant in this study a similar observation was made regarding the adsorption of organic contaminants fig 10b the similar xrd data for tnt cs before and after adsorption bavykin et al 27 also found that the xrd patterns of tnt before and after adsorbing mb dye were the same the results suggest that the adsorption processes did not affect the crystal characteristics of the tnt cs composite fig 5 shows that the ftir spectrum of the pristine tnt cs is identical to that of the tnt cs with adsorbates the intensity and wavenumber of some highlighted bands in the tnt cs composite before and after adsorption were similar this result was expected because the adsorption forces between the adsorbent and the adsorbate were relatively weak physical adsorption was dominant therefore it was difficult to identify the primary adsorption mechanism via the ftir spectroscopy the active na ions on the tnt cs structure can act as effective exchange sites for cationic metal ions and mb cations in the solution table 1 several reports have detailed this type of primary ion exchange mechanism 4 26 27 49 50 moreover the zeta potential measurements demonstrated that ion exchange is the primary adsorption mechanism for cationic contaminants in addition the oxygen containing functional groups on the surface of tnt cs can adsorb metal ions and mb dyes through common inner sphere surface complexation 22 50 51 and hydrogen bonding interaction 4 6 52 respectively tnt cs exhibited a higher adsorption capacity for cu than for cd and pb fig 9 because of the higher affinity of complexation between cu a transition metal and the oxygen functionalities on its surface 51 53 54 although electron donor acceptor interactions π π interactions have been reported as the main adsorption mechanism of aromatic pollutants i e mb phenol and toluene by carbonaceous materials i e biochar and activated carbon this interaction is less important for hydrochar because of the weak aromatic cc bonds in this material 6 52 the cs material in the tnt cs composite was defined as a hydrochar because it was prepared through the hydrothermal carbonization at 190 c section 2 2 or fig 1 therefore π π interactions played a minor role in the adsorption of mb phenol and toluene on the tnt cs composite phenol m w 94 g mol and toluene 92 g mol possess similar molecular weights however phenol exhibited a higher adsorption affinity for tnt cs than toluene fig 9 this could be because of the hydrophilic nature of phenol its water solubility of 75 000 mg l compared to that of toluene hydrophobic 515 mg l therefore the main adsorption mechanism of phenol hydrophilic interaction and toluene hydrophobic interaction was van der waals force 55 56 such a force has been identified for mb adsorption by hydrochar 6 52 each phenol molecule containing one hydroxyl group can be adsorbed by the surface oxygen functionality of tnt cs through a hydrogen bonding mechanism 34 57 in summary the synthesized tnt cs composite can uptake cationic heavy metals cationic dyes and high polar and relatively low polar organic molecules the major adsorption mechanisms for the six adsorbates differed with the properties of the tnt and cs precursors the adsorption of potentially toxic metals cu cd and pb by tnt cs mainly occurred through ion exchange and complexation the ion exchange van der waals forces and hydrogen bonding interactions played important roles in the adsorption of mb by tnt cs compared to the π π interactions the primary mechanisms for phenol adsorption were van der waals forces and hydrogen bonding interactions with a minor contribution from the π π interactions in the case of toluene the primary mechanism was the van der waals force minor π π contribution 4 conclusions the new composite adsorbent tnt cs was firstly synthesized with the combined characteristics of titanate nanotube tnt and carbon sphere cs to enable the adsorption of different kinds of contaminants including pb ii cd ii cu ii mb dye phenol and especially toluene the calcination temperatures had great effects on the properties chemical thermal stability surface functional group surface morphology textural parameters surface charge crystallinity and cation exchange capacity and adsorption capacity of the resultant composites adsorption isotherms at ph 5 0 were investigated to estimate the maximum adsorption capacity q max of the materials through the langmuir model the q max values of tnt cs 534 518 514 2 690 and 329 mg g to pb cd cu mb dye and phenol were overwhelmingly higher than those of available commercial activated carbon 26 3 23 8 21 4 285 239 mg g respectively the q max values of tnt cs calcinated from 300 c to 800 c were in the range of 334 523 mg g for adsorbing pb 384 477 mg g for cd 297 453 mg g for cu 394 677 mg g for mb dye 303 416 mg g for phenol and 118 260 mg g for toluene both tnt cs and calcinated tnt cs composites exhibited an excellent adsorption capacity compared to cac the primary adsorption mechanism for the test cationic contaminants was electrostatic attraction and ion exchange the primary adsorption mechanism for phenol and toluene was van der waals interaction the synthesized composite adsorbents could uptake both cationic and non ionic organic contaminants hence they are promising to significantly simplify wastewater

12747,permeable reactive barrier technology is an alternative method to conventional systems for pumping and treating contaminated groundwater in contrast to existing applications the use of reactive materials for the comprehensive removal of contaminants from post processing water in deep installations is novel in this study investigations of post processing water contaminants may concern areas of decommissioned landfills post industrial areas post mining areas this paper presents the concept of using permeable reactive barriers to remove contaminants generated in the georeactor previous research has focused on single materials for selective removal of contaminants i e activated carbon zeolite and nanoiron the experimental study was carried out on the example of water generated during the underground coal gasification process the study showed that the combination of materials in sandwich form resulted in a significant improvement in the removal of compounds compared to using the materials separately activated carbon and zeolite together used effectively reduced organic contaminants such as phenol 99 phenol benzene toluene ethylbenzene xylene 100 btex and inorganic contaminants containing ionic compounds such as cyanides 33 and metallic and non metallic elements with toxic effects on the environment i e lead 83 zinc 77 copper 74 nickel 68 chromium 40 and cobalt 16 from post processing water a novelty in the presented work is the comprehensive simultaneous removal of organic and inorganic contaminants on a multilayer reactive bed keywords reactive materials permeable reactive barriers coal conversion georeactor post processing water treatment data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction post processing waters from post industrial areas coking plants decommissioned landfill sites post mining sites including traditional underground mining and georeactor processes require comprehensive mechanical chemical biological and physicochemical treatment 1 4 technologies based on clean technologies for low carbon power generation are also currently being developed new geotechnological solutions are understood as deliberate engineering measures to move energy operations underground an important role is played by hazard identification and recognition of contaminants generated during technological processes in the process of underground coal gasification ucg involving thermal and chemical transformations occurring in coal seams between organic material and the gasification agent such as air oxygen steam and carbon dioxide there is a risk of contamination of the groundwater environment by liquid and gaseous products during the process as well as after the operation of the georeactor wastewater is generated which is mainly treated condensates such wastewater is then separated in the various components of the gas discharge and treatment system the process produces organic contaminants such as benzene toluene ethylbenzene xylene btex phenols and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs and inorganic contaminants such as ammonia nitrogen cyanides and heavy metals 5 8 discharge of this effluent without prior treatment to groundwater or surface water may pose a risk to the aquatic environment these wastewaters should be treated before re entering the environment in poland according to national law which substances harmful to the aquatic environment and what conditions must be met when discharging such wastewater into the environment are regulated by the regulation of the minister of maritime affairs and inland navigation of july 12 2019 9 treatment of waters contaminated with such mixtures requires application of a combination of remediation methods in accordance with the requirements of the water framework directive wfd the amount of wastewater generated during and after the process depends on the configuration of the gasification system the hydrogeological conditions prevailing in the georeactor area and the thermodynamic conditions during the process as well as the water demand using the ucg process at the wieczorek coal mine in katowice as an example it was shown that the process wastewater is highly toxic and requires treatment to reduce the risk of groundwater contamination after the georeactor is shut down it was shown that during the coal gasification experiment the water environment was sufficiently protected against negative effects of the process moreover control studies conducted 5 years after the experiment confirmed the earlier results 10 however in the case of uncontrolled and or unpredictable progress of the process the occurrence of emergency situations especially when conducting the process at great depths in a complex geological structure when gasifying coal residues and when conducting processes in areas at risk of rock bursts or seismically other methods of protecting the georeactor zone from the escape of by products outside the reaction zone should be considered dangerous transformations and mechanical phenomena may be initiated in the event of a rapid increase in temperature pressure or unsealing of the georeactor space contaminated liquids and reactive gases may flow into the rock mass in addition there may be a risk of fire gas or coal dust explosion radiation hazards vibrations and shocks leading to cracks and deformations on the surface 11 an innovation in geoengineering is the implementation of permeable reactive barrier prb technology in the georeactor space to control the process which becomes more efficient easier to implement and safer for the environment these barriers can be an effective method to protect the aquatic environment from contamination the barrier is a zone filled with a reactive material the purpose of which is to effectively immobilize and or reduce the concentration of contaminants to limit values such a removal system can permanently reduce the migration of contaminants into the rock mass and relatively reduce the volume and concentration of contaminants removal of contaminants occurs through chemical physical and or biological processes such as sorption precipitation oxidation reduction fixation or degradation 12 16 currently ucg is an alternative to the pump and treat method which involves pumping contaminated water and treating it at the surface many types of plant design are available for prb such as excavation backfilled with reactive material caissons soil mixing use of high pressure spraying and vertical hydraulic fracturing to inject reactive material a barrier made of permeable reactive material is placed in the rock mass in the path of the migrating contaminant plume the barrier design must be capable of transforming the contaminant into a less harmful non toxic substance or immobilizing the contaminant in the barrier without posing the risk of secondary contamination of water by leaching of particular importance is the selection of the reactive material and its effectiveness in eliminating the target contaminant while maintaining sufficient permeability to ensure flow through the bed currently more than 200 prb devices have been installed worldwide for different pollution scenarios but there are relatively few deep installations deepwater construction methods are expected to evolve significantly over the next few years primarily in regards to the ability to install more efficient in situ barriers using fast reacting media the use of a reactive barrier in deep reservoir operations is intended to minimize the spread of liquid and gaseous contaminants in emergency situations that may occur in the event of uncontrolled and or unpredictable operations throughout the process in addition the barrier can be used to limit the flushing of contaminants out of the reaction zone at the end of the reservoir operation from the point of view of the method of medium injection into the rock mass a distinction is made between methods based on a system of underground workings a grid of vertical and directional boreholes drilled from the surface a combined system comprising underground workings supplemented with directional boreholes usually horizontal and vertical or oblique surface boreholes 17 in deep georeactors contaminants can be removed by injection hydraulic fracturing or backfilling of the cavern groundwater monitoring is carried out during and after the georeactor process to ensure early detection of contaminants before they migrate gathering information on contaminant concentrations is essential for effective remediation using in situ technologies despite modern techniques to predict control and monitor the coal conversion process in the georeactor there is a risk of contaminants seeping into groundwater during and after the gasification process the use of reactive materials will allow low cost and efficient removal of contaminants from water systems activated carbon zeolite and modified zeolite bituminous coal lignite and char a mixture of lignite zeolite and compost and nanoiron are the most commonly used as well as the use of coconut shells various types of clay and soil in addition these materials can also improve the safety of the industrial process by reducing the potential risk of contaminating the mining site with uncontrolled liquid and gas emissions 7 13 18 23 response zone design requires an understanding of the extent and concentration of the contaminant and its variability over time 24 26 in addition an important issue is the selection of a suitable reactive material important in the selection of a material is the evaluation of the contaminant removal efficiency i e sorption capacity reactivity durability stability regenerability environmentally friendly by products availability and price the hydraulic capacity of the material is generally a function of grain size the appropriate grain size of the material used provides a compromise between its reactivity and permeability these properties are often identified by laboratory and column tests the work of the central mining institute gig analyzed and identified organic and inorganic contaminants investigated the leaching of contaminants from secondary waste in the cavern and possible strategies to control groundwater and gasification gas and presented

large differences in the removal efficiency of the reactive materials in relation to the reference water and the post processing water condensate which gave rise to a subsequent investigation of the combination of materials used in all measurements activated carbon proved to be more effective than zeolite in the reference water activated carbon reduced 98 of the phenols on the first day of the

nanoiron contributed less to the removal of this contaminant from the reference water 69 reduction of phenols on the first day and 41 on the second day of the test and showed no effect in removing contaminants from the post processing water on the one hand due to the rapid decrease in reactivity of the material and on the other to the partial leaching of nanoiron from the reactive bed nanoiron is a material more suitable for quick action at a specific contaminant plume or for multiple applications so the use of this material in long term studies was abandoned figs 4 5 show a comparison of the selected physicochemical parameter ph from previous experiments for activated carbon zeolite and nanoiron the removal efficiency of organic and inorganic contaminants generated in the ucg process was investigated for the combined reactive materials comprising activated carbon and zeolite column tests for the simultaneous use of activated carbon with zeolite during the removal of contaminants from post processing water were presented by suponik and lutynski 33 in their work the researchers showed that activated carbon together with zeolite effectively removed phenols 73 btx 70 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 92 and free cyanides 78 relative to input levels for heavy metals there was a reduction of nickel 40 chromium 10 and zinc 6 from the post processing water unlike our predecessors we conducted a long term test on a larger scale the removal efficiency of organic pollutants on a bed of combined reactive materials i e activated carbon with zeolite is shown in the following graphs figs 6 11 as shown in figs 6 11 the multilayer bed consisting of activated carbon and zeolite proved effective in reducing the levels of organic contaminants such as phenol 99 phenol reduction benzene toluene ethylbenzene xylene 100 btex from the post processing water during the long term test figs 12 14 show the comparison of physicochemical parameters ph redox potential conductivity using the

composition of the solution and concentration of solutes in solution the results showed that an increase in the duration of the long term experiment compared to the short term study figs 4 5 and 12 indicates longer lasting physicochemical changes in the post processing water during removal of contaminants with reactive materials 30 studies conducted during the coal gasification process have shown that metals present in coal can remain in the combustion gasification products and moreover the degree of enrichment of these elements depends on both the type of ash and the properties of the element strugała wilczek and stańczyk 7 studied the leaching of toxic metals such as chromium lead and cobalt from the residues of the coal gasification process their presence outside the georeactor space may indicate a risk of environmental contamination therefore it is important to use methods to counteract this phenomenon the use of reactive materials can serve to reduce inorganic contaminants containing heavy metal ions matejkova soukup kastanek capek grabowski stańczyk and solcova 28 presented a study of the decontamination of post processing waters from ucg contaminated with organic and inorganic substances for laboratory sorption experiments two zeolites bentonite and montmorillonite two activated carbons supersorbon and norit and a nanoiron nanofer were selected the activated carbons showed 100 efficiency in removing phenols while for the zeolites the value ranged from 5 to 38 for major metal ions the use of activated carbons reduced 85 to 100 of zinc and 100 of mercury 30 of nickel and cobalt and 25 of arsenic while for zeolite 65 of nickel 45 of cobalt 25 of zinc and 5 of arsenic the major and trace metals present in the coal can be leached at the end of the process by incoming groundwater selected results of the removal efficiency of inorganic contaminants on the activated carbon and zeolite bed in a long term test are shown in figs 15 17 tables 2 and 3 compare the results of the short term experiments with activated carbon and zeolite and the long term experiment with a combination of both materials as shown in table 2 activated carbon removed both 100 btex from the reference and post processing water on the first day of the test and 90 and 81 btex respectively on the second day of the test in the case of the zeolite bed 81 reduction was achieved on the first day and 21 on the second day while in the post processing water 26 btex reduction was achieved in the case of the nanoiron bed breakthrough was observed during the short tests in relation to the input water for both the reference water and the post processing water in table 3 the simultaneous use of activated carbon with zeolite showed the best efficiency in removing contaminants from post processing water extracted from the ucg process as shown in table 3 activated carbon and zeolite used together effectively reduced organic contaminants such as phenol 99 benzene toluene ethylbenzene xylene 100 btex and inorganic contaminants containing ionic compounds such as cyanides 33 and metallic and non metallic environmental toxic elements i e lead 83 zinc 77 copper 74 nickel 68 chromium 40 and cobalt 16 from post processing water the solubility of inorganic compounds decreases in the ph range from neutral to slightly basic difficultly soluble metal hydroxides are formed whose solubility and mobility may increase in acidic solutions or in the case of amphoteric hydroxides in very basic solutions studies on the effect of time on metal sorption have shown that sorption to the surface layer occurs very rapidly while the establishment of sorption equilibrium is a long term process the amount of bound metal ions also depends on the concentration of the suspension an increase in the concentration of the solid phase in solution causes a decrease in sorption the concentration of the suspension also affects the sorption rate at a constant initial metal concentration in solution sorption increases with increasing suspension concentration as the surface area for the sorbed ions increases the rate of sorption also depends on temperature the increase in sorption rate as a function of temperature is exponential increasing temperature increases the rate of endothermic reactions more than exothermic reactions the simultaneous use of activated carbon with zeolite showed the best efficiency in removing contaminants from post processing water from the ucg process a multilayer bed formed of activated carbon and zeolite in sandwich form activated carbon zeolite activated carbon was found to effectively remove btex from the post processing water activated carbon combined with zeolite also helped reduce lead zinc copper nickel and chromium 4 conclusions the formation of post processing water and reaction products during the in situ process may involve a potential risk of negative environmental impact the main issue addressed by the authors of this paper was to analyze the efficiency of contaminant removal from water using a reactive bed the experiments carried out confirmed that tests on the removal efficiency of contaminants from post processing water should be carried out for the actual waste water condensate due to the presence of solid particles such as tar and ash which are not contained in the reference water running the test for one month allowed to confirm the results obtained in the removal efficiency tests and to investigate the stability of the whole process in the long term the resulting bed showed higher removal efficiencies for phenols 99 and btex 100 while activated carbon and zeolite used separately removed contaminants from the post processing water less efficiently this study also examined inorganic contaminants containing heavy metal ions activated carbon combined with zeolite removing contaminants from post processing water as aluminum 95 lead 83 zinc 77 copper 74 nickel 68 chromium 40 and cobalt 16 from post processing water removal of these metals is necessary because they are toxic substances that should not be discharged directly into the environment the use of reactive barriers during and after the georeactor process makes it possible to minimize contaminant leaching outside the georeactor zone into the rock mass key aspects for the correct and efficient design of technologies in deep locations and the prevention of possible process malfunctions are the correct characterization of the rock mass an understanding of water flow conditions and numerical modelling of groundwater flow and transport of the resulting contaminants when considering the use of reactive materials for the removal of generated products in the in situ process it is important to bear in mind the limited sorption capacity of activated carbon and zeolites and the need for their reactivation these materials must be replaced periodically to prevent them from becoming a secondary source of environmental contamination this fact and the technological difficulties involved in installing and replacing the materials are challenging and require further analysis and work in this area declaration of

12747,permeable reactive barrier technology is an alternative method to conventional systems for pumping and treating contaminated groundwater in contrast to existing applications the use of reactive materials for the comprehensive removal of contaminants from post processing water in deep installations is novel in this study investigations of post processing water contaminants may concern areas of decommissioned landfills post industrial areas post mining areas this paper presents the concept of using permeable reactive barriers to remove contaminants generated in the georeactor previous research has focused on single materials for selective removal of contaminants i e activated carbon zeolite and nanoiron the experimental study was carried out on the example of water generated during the underground coal gasification process the study showed that the combination of materials in sandwich form resulted in a significant improvement in the removal of compounds compared to using the materials separately activated carbon and zeolite together used effectively reduced organic contaminants such as phenol 99 phenol benzene toluene ethylbenzene xylene 100 btex and inorganic contaminants containing ionic compounds such as cyanides 33 and metallic and non metallic elements with toxic effects on the environment i e lead 83 zinc 77 copper 74 nickel 68 chromium 40 and cobalt 16 from post processing water a novelty in the presented work is the comprehensive simultaneous removal of organic and inorganic contaminants on a multilayer reactive bed keywords reactive materials permeable reactive barriers coal conversion georeactor post processing water treatment data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction post processing waters from post industrial areas coking plants decommissioned landfill sites post mining sites including traditional underground mining and georeactor processes require comprehensive mechanical chemical biological and physicochemical treatment 1 4 technologies based on clean technologies for low carbon power generation are also currently being developed new geotechnological solutions are understood as deliberate engineering measures to move energy operations underground an important role is played by hazard identification and recognition of contaminants generated during technological processes in the process of underground coal gasification ucg involving thermal and chemical transformations occurring in coal seams between organic material and the gasification agent such as air oxygen steam and carbon dioxide there is a risk of contamination of the groundwater environment by liquid and gaseous products during the process as well as after the operation of the georeactor wastewater is generated which is mainly treated condensates such wastewater is then separated in the various components of the gas discharge and treatment system the process produces organic contaminants such as benzene toluene ethylbenzene xylene btex phenols and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs and inorganic contaminants such as ammonia nitrogen cyanides and heavy metals 5 8 discharge of this effluent without prior treatment to groundwater or surface water may pose a risk to the aquatic environment these wastewaters should be treated before re entering the environment in poland according to national law which substances harmful to the aquatic environment and what conditions must be met when discharging such wastewater into the environment are regulated by the regulation of the minister of maritime affairs and inland navigation of july 12 2019 9 treatment of waters contaminated with such mixtures requires application of a combination of remediation methods in accordance with the requirements of the water framework directive wfd the amount of wastewater generated during and after the process depends on the configuration of the gasification system the hydrogeological conditions prevailing in the georeactor area and the thermodynamic conditions during the process as well as the water demand using the ucg process at the wieczorek coal mine in katowice as an example it was shown that the process wastewater is highly toxic and requires treatment to reduce the risk of groundwater contamination after the georeactor is shut down it was shown that during the coal gasification experiment the water environment was sufficiently protected against negative effects of the process moreover control studies conducted 5 years after the experiment confirmed the earlier results 10 however in the case of uncontrolled and or unpredictable progress of the process the occurrence of emergency situations especially when conducting the process at great depths in a complex geological structure when gasifying coal residues and when conducting processes in areas at risk of rock bursts or seismically other methods of protecting the georeactor zone from the escape of by products outside the reaction zone should be considered dangerous transformations and mechanical phenomena may be initiated in the event of a rapid increase in temperature pressure or unsealing of the georeactor space contaminated liquids and reactive gases may flow into the rock mass in addition there may be a risk of fire gas or coal dust explosion radiation hazards vibrations and shocks leading to cracks and deformations on the surface 11 an innovation in geoengineering is the implementation of permeable reactive barrier prb technology in the georeactor space to control the process which becomes more efficient easier to implement and safer for the environment these barriers can be an effective method to protect the aquatic environment from contamination the barrier is a zone filled with a reactive material the purpose of which is to effectively immobilize and or reduce the concentration of contaminants to limit values such a removal system can permanently reduce the migration of contaminants into the rock mass and relatively reduce the volume and concentration of contaminants removal of contaminants occurs through chemical physical and or biological processes such as sorption precipitation oxidation reduction fixation or degradation 12 16 currently ucg is an alternative to the pump and treat method which involves pumping contaminated water and treating it at the surface many types of plant design are available for prb such as excavation backfilled with reactive material caissons soil mixing use of high pressure spraying and vertical hydraulic fracturing to inject reactive material a barrier made of permeable reactive material is placed in the rock mass in the path of the migrating contaminant plume the barrier design must be capable of transforming the contaminant into a less harmful non toxic substance or immobilizing the contaminant in the barrier without posing the risk of secondary contamination of water by leaching of particular importance is the selection of the reactive material and its effectiveness in eliminating the target contaminant while maintaining sufficient permeability to ensure flow through the bed currently more than 200 prb devices have been installed worldwide for different pollution scenarios but there are relatively few deep installations deepwater construction methods are expected to evolve significantly over the next few years primarily in regards to the ability to install more efficient in situ barriers using fast reacting media the use of a reactive barrier in deep reservoir operations is intended to minimize the spread of liquid and gaseous contaminants in emergency situations that may occur in the event of uncontrolled and or unpredictable operations throughout the process in addition the barrier can be used to limit the flushing of contaminants out of the reaction zone at the end of the reservoir operation from the point of view of the method of medium injection into the rock mass a distinction is made between methods based on a system of underground workings a grid of vertical and directional boreholes drilled from the surface a combined system comprising underground workings supplemented with directional boreholes usually horizontal and vertical or oblique surface boreholes 17 in deep georeactors contaminants can be removed by injection hydraulic fracturing or backfilling of the cavern groundwater monitoring is carried out during and after the georeactor process to ensure early detection of contaminants before they migrate gathering information on contaminant concentrations is essential for effective remediation using in situ technologies despite modern techniques to predict control and monitor the coal conversion process in the georeactor there is a risk of contaminants seeping into groundwater during and after the gasification process the use of reactive materials will allow low cost and efficient removal of contaminants from water systems activated carbon zeolite and modified zeolite bituminous coal lignite and char a mixture of lignite zeolite and compost and nanoiron are the most commonly used as well as the use of coconut shells various types of clay and soil in addition these materials can also improve the safety of the industrial process by reducing the potential risk of contaminating the mining site with uncontrolled liquid and gas emissions 7 13 18 23 response zone design requires an understanding of the extent and concentration of the contaminant and its variability over time 24 26 in addition an important issue is the selection of a suitable reactive material important in the selection of a material is the evaluation of the contaminant removal efficiency i e sorption capacity reactivity durability stability regenerability environmentally friendly by products availability and price the hydraulic capacity of the material is generally a function of grain size the appropriate grain size of the material used provides a compromise between its reactivity and permeability these properties are often identified by laboratory and column tests the work of the central mining institute gig analyzed and identified organic and inorganic contaminants investigated the leaching of contaminants from secondary waste in the cavern and possible strategies to control groundwater and gasification gas and presented

composition of the solution and concentration of solutes in solution the results showed that an increase in the duration of the long term experiment compared to the short term study figs 4 5 and 12 indicates longer lasting physicochemical changes in the post processing water during removal of contaminants with reactive materials 30 studies conducted during the coal gasification process have shown that metals present in coal can remain in the combustion gasification products and moreover the degree of enrichment of these elements depends on both the type of ash and the properties of the element strugała wilczek and stańczyk 7 studied the leaching of toxic metals such as chromium lead and cobalt from the residues of the coal gasification process their presence outside the georeactor space may indicate a risk of environmental contamination therefore it is important to use methods to counteract this phenomenon the use of reactive materials can serve to reduce inorganic contaminants containing heavy metal ions matejkova soukup kastanek capek grabowski stańczyk and solcova 28 presented a study of the decontamination of post processing waters from ucg contaminated with organic and inorganic substances for laboratory sorption experiments two zeolites bentonite and montmorillonite two activated carbons supersorbon and norit and a nanoiron nanofer were selected the activated carbons showed 100 efficiency in removing phenols while for the zeolites the value ranged from 5 to 38 for major metal ions the use of activated carbons reduced 85 to 100 of zinc and 100 of mercury 30 of nickel and cobalt and 25 of arsenic while for zeolite 65 of nickel 45 of cobalt 25 of zinc and 5 of arsenic the major and trace metals present in the coal can be leached at the end of the process by incoming groundwater selected results of the removal efficiency of inorganic contaminants on the activated carbon and zeolite bed in a long term test are shown in figs 15 17 tables 2 and 3 compare the results of the short term experiments with activated carbon and zeolite and the long term experiment with a combination of both materials as shown in table 2 activated carbon removed both 100 btex from the reference and post processing water on the first day of the test and 90 and 81 btex respectively on the second day of the test in the case of the zeolite bed 81 reduction was achieved on the first day and 21 on the second day while in the post processing water 26 btex reduction was achieved in the case of the nanoiron bed breakthrough was observed during the short tests in relation to the input water for both the reference water and the post processing water in table 3 the simultaneous use of activated carbon with zeolite showed the best efficiency in removing contaminants from post processing water extracted from the ucg process as shown in table 3 activated carbon and zeolite used together effectively reduced organic contaminants such as phenol 99 benzene toluene ethylbenzene xylene 100 btex and inorganic contaminants containing ionic compounds such as cyanides 33 and metallic and non metallic environmental toxic elements i e lead 83 zinc 77 copper 74 nickel 68 chromium 40 and cobalt 16 from post processing water the solubility of inorganic compounds decreases in the ph range from neutral to slightly basic difficultly soluble metal hydroxides are formed whose solubility and mobility may increase in acidic solutions or in the case of amphoteric hydroxides in very basic solutions studies on the effect of time on metal sorption have shown that sorption to the surface layer occurs very rapidly while the establishment of sorption equilibrium is a long term process the amount of bound metal ions also depends on the concentration of the suspension an increase in the concentration of the solid phase in solution causes a decrease in sorption the concentration of the suspension also affects the sorption rate at a constant initial metal concentration in solution sorption increases with increasing suspension concentration as the surface area for the sorbed ions increases the rate of sorption also depends on temperature the increase in sorption rate as a function of temperature is exponential increasing temperature increases the rate of endothermic reactions more than exothermic reactions the simultaneous use of activated carbon with zeolite showed the best efficiency in removing contaminants from post processing water from the ucg process a multilayer bed formed of activated carbon and zeolite in sandwich form activated carbon zeolite activated carbon was found to effectively remove btex from the post processing water activated carbon combined with zeolite also helped reduce lead zinc copper nickel and chromium 4 conclusions the formation of post processing water and reaction products during the in situ process may involve a potential risk of negative environmental impact the main issue addressed by the authors of this paper was to analyze the efficiency of contaminant removal from water using a reactive bed the experiments carried out confirmed that tests on the removal efficiency of contaminants from post processing water should be carried out for the actual waste water condensate due to the presence of solid particles such as tar and ash which are not contained in the reference water running the test for one month allowed to confirm the results obtained in the removal efficiency tests and to investigate the stability of the whole process in the long term the resulting bed showed higher removal efficiencies for phenols 99 and btex 100 while activated carbon and zeolite used separately removed contaminants from the post processing water less efficiently this study also examined inorganic contaminants containing heavy metal ions activated carbon combined with zeolite removing contaminants from post processing water as aluminum 95 lead 83 zinc 77 copper 74 nickel 68 chromium 40 and cobalt 16 from post processing water removal of these metals is necessary because they are toxic substances that should not be discharged directly into the environment the use of reactive barriers during and after the georeactor process makes it possible to minimize contaminant leaching outside the georeactor zone into the rock mass key aspects for the correct and efficient design of technologies in deep locations and the prevention of possible process malfunctions are the correct characterization of the rock mass an understanding of water flow conditions and numerical modelling of groundwater flow and transport of the resulting contaminants when considering the use of reactive materials for the removal of generated products in the in situ process it is important to bear in mind the limited sorption capacity of activated carbon and zeolites and the need for their reactivation these materials must be replaced periodically to prevent them from becoming a secondary source of environmental contamination this fact and the technological difficulties involved in installing and replacing the materials are challenging and require further analysis and work in this area declaration of

12748,the difficulty in metabolizing and degrading complex dyes containing three or more aromatic rings ascends new alternatives in the treatment of colored water including adsorption despite advances in this area the adsorption of complex dyes has been little reported in this work polyacrylonitrile membranes incorporated with graphene oxide functionalized with safranin dye hpan go sf were applied to remove the complex cationic dyes basic blue 7 bb7 and basic brown 4 bb4 and the anionic direct black 22 db22 from water the advantage of using nanoadsorbents immobilized on polymeric membranes is their easy removal after adsorption under the best conditions established for dye removal high adsorption capacities of 1143 1035 873 799 and 205 148 mg g 1 were achieved for bb4 bb7 and db22 in the single and saline system respectively henry and temkin s isothermal models best fitted equilibrium experimental data of dyes in single and saline systems respectively while the kinetic model of intraparticle diffusion fitted well the empirical data in both systems furthermore hpan go sf can be used for five consecutive cycles without loss of efficiency for the bb7 dye theoretical calculations and post adsorbed membrane analyses showed that the adsorbent adsorbate interactions are based on h bonding π π and electrostatic interactions graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords polymeric membranes functionalized graphene oxide complex dyes adsorption density functional theory data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction textile and clothing industries are one of the main socio economic pillars of lower middle income countries allied with the growth of this sector the presence of dyes in wastewater becomes recurrent 1 synthetic dyes industrially preferred to natural dyes are classified according to their chemical properties such as azo triarylmethane phthalocyanine anthraquinone and sulfur dyes 2 the more complex the dye the more difficult it is to decompose thus the so called complex dyes substances with more than three aromatic rings are considerably more difficult to degrade and can produce toxic metabolites 3 the cationic dyes basic blue 7 bb7 triarylmethane dye fig 1a and basic brown 4 bb4 azo dye fig 1b and the anionic dye direct black 22 db22 azo dye fig 1c are some of the complex dyes commonly used in the dyeing of natural fibers and polymeric fibers 4 despite their wide applications these recalcitrant organic contaminants usually are considered toxic mutagenic and carcinogenic and when in hydric bodies may obstruct the sunlight passage and reduce oxygen solubility 5 therefore the toxicological potentials and the resistance of dyes to degradation represent a central challenge for complex dyes removal technologies due to the complexity of their structures the removal of these dyes from water has been little explored with chemical methodologies such as photocatalysis oxidation and ozonation being the most studied however these complex and expensive processes can generate by products that are more toxic than the starting materials 6 thus the scientific community has shown great interest in treating of colored waters by adsorptive processes given the technique s advantages 7 adsorption a mass transfer phenomenon in which adsorptive molecules accumulate on the interlayer of a liquid and solid phase is a simple technique with low execution and maintenance costs and a high removal rate the adsorbent adsorbate interactions involve chemical and physical processes so the technique s performance is strictly linked to the sorbent materials used these materials must have an extensive surface area selectivity high adsorption potential and recyclability potential 8 among the various adsorbent materials used in the treatment of colored water graphene oxide go stands out go is a nanoadsorbent derived from the incomplete oxidation of graphite given its nanosheets structure of sp2 hybridized carbons with carboxyl hydroxyl and epoxide groups on the sheets it can interact with organic compounds and metallic ions 9 despite the adsorptive potential of go studies have shown that its adsorbent character can be enhanced by functionalization neves et al 10 grafted go with quaternary ammonium salt to prepare a new adsorbent with capacity of stripping bb4 dye from water the maximum removal potential of the mcs go qas adsorbent was about 650 mg g 1 although several studies have demonstrated the preparation and application of new go based nanomaterials there is a limiting factor regarding the difficulty of removing the adsorbent from water after use proposals such as immobilization of go in polymeric structures and preparation of magnetic adsorbents are some of the alternatives reported in recent years 11 among the techniques go immobilization in polymeric membranes stands out for combining two technologies in the treatment of colored water separation and adsorption 12 zhu et al 13 reported the significant potential for retention of the reactive dyes reactive red 49 97 2 and black 5 99 2 by polyethersulfone loose nanofiltration membrane incorporated with go functionalized by poly sulfobetaine methacrylate pes go psbma the use of go incorporated into polymeric membranes for adsorption of dyes in batch assays was reported once by das et al 14 they immobilized chitosan and graphene oxide into polyvinyl alcohol membrane like adsorbents and used it in congo red dye adsorption however high dose of the adsorbent was required and consequently low congo red dye adsorption capacity was achieved remaining at 12 mg g 1 recently we showed that polyacrylonitrile membranes incorporated with go hpan go and go functionalized with safranin sf dye hpan go sf 15 had great potential for removal of multiple contaminants in water even under non optimal conditions with adsorption capacities of 246 7 and 225 6 mg m 2 for basic green 4 and basic blue 26 dyes respectively in continuous flow and of 200 6 191 1 and 154 8 mg g 1 for propranolol pharmacological drug methylene blue dye and benzalkonium chloride surfactant respectively in batch assays in this study 15 we could conclude that the adsorbate s flow profile directly influences the polymeric membranes selectivity therefore despite advances in this area the adsorption of complex dyes on polymeric membranes incorporated with functionalized go has not been explored in batch assays and the adsorbent adsorbate interaction mechanisms have not been studied thus the goal of the current research was to investigate the removal potential of the cationic complex dyes bb7 and bb4 and the anionic complex dye db22 by the hpan go sf membrane in batch studies and to delineate the mechanisms that govern the interactive membrane complex dyes process therefore parameters such as solution ph adsorbent adsorbate contact time nanomaterial content in the membrane membrane amount dye concentration and medium temperature parameters were analyzed the membrane adsorption potential for complex dyes was also explored in saline medium and the regenerative ability of hpan go sf was evaluated in consecutive cycles of adsorption meanwhile kinetic and isotherm models were employed to assess the adsorbent adsorbate interactions in single system and in the presence of interfering agents furthermore studies of the membrane complex dyes interactive mechanisms were based on ftir sem and xps analyses of the membranes post adsorptive process and on density functional theory dft calculations a tool used to detail quantum systems of molecules in the ground state and relate it to the reactivity to adsorption on solid surfaces 2 experimental section information regarding this topic is presented in the supplementary material it includes the reagents and methodologies utilized for the membranes preparation and descriptions of the adsorption assays and the studies performed 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterizations in previous work 15 hpan go sf membranes were prepared and characterized a summary of the results of the characterizations performed is shown in table 1 in a previous work 15 removal tests for multiple contaminants in water were performed to evaluate how go and go sf influenced the polyacrylonitrile polymer pan adsorption capacity the results indicated that incorporating go and go sf into the polymeric matrix has provided morphological and chemical physical modifications to the pristine membrane enhancing the adsorptive character of hpan among the evaluated contaminants the new membranes stood out from the hpan go and hpan membranes for the cationic dyes bb7 and bb4 and for the anionic one db22 thus the three contaminants were selected to investigate the adsorptive potential and the interactive mechanisms of hpan go sf membranes 3 2 adsorption performances of bb7 bb4 and db22 dyes onto hpan go sf 3 2 1 initial ph effects adsorption assays were performed at various initial phs fig 2a to evaluate the influence of ph on the adsorption of dyes through the hpan go sf membrane for bb4 and db22 dyes the ph ranged from 2 to 12 while for bb7 dye the maximum ph was 8 due to its insoluble character under basic conditions 4 the adsorbent adsorbate interactions for the three contaminants were ph dependent fig 2a concerning the bb7 dye fig 2a the hpan go sf membrane provided lower adsorption at ph 2 about 48 7 mg g 1 this may be associated with protonation of the membrane nitrogen and oxygen based functions which increased the zeta potential table 1 reducing the electrostatic attractions with the cationic dye the microspecies of bb7 dye according to ph are shown in fig s2a and indicate the presence of positively charged molecules at ph 2 at ph 4 and 8 the adsorption potentials of bb7 were similar 145 2 and 132 7 mg g 1 respectively at ph 4 despite being less electronegative than at higher ph the hpan go sf membrane has an estimated surface charge of 25 8 mv table 1 while the average charge of bb7 species is 2 8 fig s2a at ph 8 the membrane surface charge dropped to 40 6 mv table 1 and dye molecules decreased to 1 0 fig s2a in both cases differences between adsorbent adsorbate charges may have generated attractive forces as indicated by the results fig 2a at ph 6 where the highest adsorption potential of the membrane was observed 173 2 mg g 1 the average charge of the dye species present in the medium is 1 03 fig s2a while hpan go sf has a decreased surface charge of 35 5 mv table 1 compared to basic conditions although the differences between the charges are similar to those estimated at ph 8 at ph 6 the presence of di cationic dye species fig s2a not present at the most basic ph may contribute to a more significant adsorbent adsorbate interaction thus as the electrostatic attraction forces are higher at ph 6 than at other phs there is closer proximity adsorbent adsorbate which enables and potentiates h bonding and π π interactions regarding bb4 dye fig 2b the hpan go sf membrane showed lower adsorption capacities at ph 2 10 and 12 median adsorption capacities at ph 4 and 8 and the highest value at ph 6 as for bb7 at ph 2 the membrane exhibited a low adsorption potential of 28 0 mg g 1 due to the protonation of the hpan go sf functional groups and the average charge of bb4 species of 2 0 fig s2b which results in electrostatic repulsions between adsorbent adsorbate at ph 10 and 12 the low adsorption potentials of 85 1 and 73 7 mg g 1 are associated to the loss of stability of the dye molecules due to the excess of oh ions in the medium 16 at ph 6 the highest membrane adsorbent potential was observed 150 3 mg g 1 in this case due to the neutrality of the medium the dye molecules tend not to precipitate as in basic ph allowing greater adsorbent adsorbate interactions also considering that in this ph range although the hpan go sf membrane has an electronegative charge surface 35 5 mv table 1 the dye species in the medium have no charge fig s2b and electrostatic forces of attraction can occur between an electrified object and a neutral object 17 furthermore as the membrane is endowed with oxygenated and nitrogenous groups in addition to the dye composed of nh2 hydrogen bond can also occur 18 further enhancing the π π and electrostatic interactions between the hpan go sf and dye at ph 4 and 8 membrane adsorption potentials were similarly expressed 120 1 and 117 4 mg g 1 respectively at ph 4 opposite charges of hpan go sf 25 8 mv table 1 and dye molecules 0 3 fig s2b generate electrostatic attraction between them enhancing the adsorbent adsorbate interactions in turn at ph 8 the presence of oh in the solution albeit at a smaller concentration than in the higher ph ranges reduces the stability of the dye thus decreasing the membrane adsorption capacity compared to ph 6 10 regarding db22 dye fig 2c the highest membrane adsorptive potential of 71 8 mg g 1 was obtained at ph 2 where most dye microspecies have charges equal to 1 fig s2c which reduces the electrostatic repulsive forces between adsorbent adsorbate furthermore as the dye and membrane have nitrogen and oxygen groups hydrogen bonds may also be present in the process 4 favoring other interactions in the system the decrease in membrane adsorptive potential from 71 8 to 2 2 mg g 1 with increasing ph 2 12 was related to an increase of oh in the medium which deprotonates the functional groups of db22 and hpan go sf providing negative charges to the dye and the membrane thus increased electrostatic repulsive forces between adsorbent adsorbate result in a decrease in membrane adsorption capacity therefore according to the ph assays ph 6 was best established for the dyes bb7 and bb4 and ph 2 for the dye db22 3 2 2 contact time effects the adsorbent adsorbate contact time influence on the process of dye removal by the hpan go sf membrane was evaluated with aliquots collected in the time interval of 0 0083 26 h fig 2b the results obtained indicated that the three dyes showed similar behavior over time initially there was a progressive increase in the adsorption potential over time with maximum potential reached in 12 h followed by stabilization of the interactive process for bb7 and bb4 hpan go sf showed higher equilibrium adsorption capacities of 178 6 mg g 1 and 150 0 mg g 1 respectively regarding db22 dye the adsorption capacity was 71 1 mg g 1 probably due electrostatic repulsion between the membrane and dye both negatively charged the differences observed between the adsorption potentials of hpan go sf for the bb7 and bb4 in relation to the db22 are associated with the surface charges of the membrane and dye species despite having a fenazinium cation due to the sf hpan go sf has a negative surface charge which contributes to attractive electrostatic interactions between the membrane and the cationic dyes and repulsive forces between the membrane and the anionic dye 19 the proximity between the membrane and the bb7 and bb4 dyes mediated by attractive forces facilitates h bonding and π π adsorbent adsorbate interactions 20 on the other hand the distance due to the electrostatic repulsions between the db22 dye and the hpan go sf membrane hinders the other interactions between contaminant and adsorbent expressed by the lower adsorptive capacity of the membrane furthermore the differences between the adsorption capacities of both cationic dyes from 178 6 mg g 1 0 35 mmol g fig 2b and 150 0 mg g 1 0 32 mmol g fig 2b for bb7 and bb4 respectively may be related to the amount of aromatic rings in each molecule while bb7 dye has four aromatic structures bb4 dye has three previous studies have shown that π π interactions are some of the strongest present between adsorbent adsorbate in adsorptive systems 21 thus as bb7 has more aromatic rings than bb4 contributes to greater π π interactions between membrane and bb7 18 as the equilibrium in dye removal by hpan go sf was reached on average in 12 h the other experiments of the optimization process were performed within this time interval 3 2 3 effect of nanomaterial content on the hpan go sf membrane the adsorbent dosage on the membrane and its relation to dye adsorption was evaluated by varying the go sf content from 0 to 10 w w fig 2c for all three dyes the results showed that embedding go sf into hpan membranes improves the adsorptive capacity of the material with qe variating 135 1 179 3 mg g 1 136 9 155 6 mg g 1 and 4 5 71 8 mg g 1 for the dyes bb7 bb4 and db22 respectively for the three dyes evaluated up to the incorporation of 6 by mass of go sf in hpan there is a progressive rise in the adsorption capacity of the new membranes and subsequently a stabilization of the material s adsorption capacity this higher efficiency is related to the increase in the adsorbent adsorbate contact surface and the higher amount of active sites on the material due to the incorporation of go sf in the membrane 22 the stabilization of the membrane adsorbent system after the addition of 6 of go sf in the material is associated with the unsaturation of the interaction centers of the spare adsorbent in the membrane 23 or even due to the clustering of go sf which by forming conglomerates reduces the membrane dye contact surface 24 thus the optimized go sf content was 6 for bb7 and db22 dyes and 2 for bb4 dye 3 2 4 influence of membrane mass variation the dye adsorption performance of the new membranes concerning their mass was evaluated with variations from 0 0005 g to 0 005 g of material in 5 ml of dye solution and the evolution of hpan go sf adsorption potential for the three dyes can be seen in the fig 2d overall for all dyes evaluated the membranes showed similar adsorption profiles there was a gradual decline in the membrane adsorption potential and a progressive rise in the contaminant percentage removal with increasing hpan go sf mass when the initial membrane mass was 0 0005 g higher qe and lower removal rate were obtained for the three dyes around 295 3 mg g 1 27 7 545 1 mg g 1 58 3 and 121 6 mg g 1 12 9 for bb7 bb4 and db22 respectively in turn for the mass of 0 005 g these values decreased for qe and increased for percentage removal around 91 5 mg g 1 83 3 78 3 mg g 1 87 5 and 35 7 mg g 1 36 6 for bb7 bb4 and db22 respectively the adsorption capacity an inherent characteristic of the material is related to the number of interactive centers available in the substrate after the tests furthermore the percentage removal is related to how much of the total contaminant is adhered to the substrate after the adsorptive process therefore the more the unsaturated interaction centers after the adsorptive process the lower the material s adsorption capacity 25 and the greater the amount of adsorbate molecules adhered to the solid 26 for the assay the greater availability of interactive centers in the adsorbent according to the rise in the material mass results in an increase in unsaturation of interaction centers and contaminating molecules adhered to hpan go sf as these amounts are inversely proportional the choice of the mass of membranes to be used in the subsequent assays must consider good qe and percentage removal thus for the bb7 and db22 dyes the optimized hpango sf membrane mass was 0 0025 g and for the bb4 dye it was 0 001 g 3 2 5 dye concentration effects the effect of the initial dye content on the adsorption capacity of hpan go sf was evaluated by ranging the concentration of bb7 bb4 and db22 dyes from 50 to 700 mg l 1 and the results obtained are presented in fig 2e the membrane adsorptive potential for the three dyes fig 2e increased with the increment of contaminant in the medium up to the material saturation around the concentration of 600 700 mg l 1 in these plateaus the adsorption capacity of hpan go sf was 873 7 1 7 mmol g 1 1143 1 2 5 mmol g 1 and 204 9 mg g 1 0 2 mmol g 1 for bb7 bb4 and db22 dyes respectively as previously discussed the increase of the adsorption potential of the membranes is related to the saturation of the active sites available in the solid after the adsorption process 10 in this case the rise in the content of contaminant molecules in the solution culminates in the filling of the interactive centers of the membrane until its complete saturation from 600 mg l 1 of dye thus the initial concentration of 100 mg l 1 of dyes was estimated for the other tests 3 2 6 effect of temperature variation the effect of temperature on the adsorption capacity of hpan go sf membranes was evaluated by ranging the system temperature from 25 to 55 c fig 2f the membrane adsorption efficiency for cationic dyes increases up to 35 c from 173 2 to 206 2 mg g 1 and from 319 2 to 388 7 mg g 1 for bb7 and bb4 respectively and remains constant up to 55 c for the former and decays to 335 5 mg g 1 for the latter as for db22 dye the higher the temperature the lower the membrane adsorption capacity ranging from 71 8 to 11 9 mg g 1 for the temperature range from 25 to 55 c respectively the adsorption of organic substances depends substantially on the water solubility of these compounds 27 and the increase in temperature causes an increase in the kinetic energy and mobility of the dyes promoting greater solubility and chemical potential of the compound 28 this conformity may be indicative of the endothermic process observed for the bb7 dye fig 2f the temperature rise increased the diffusion rate of the dye up to the interactive sites of the material a relationship attributed to the weakening of h bonding between solvent adsorbate and adsorbent 27 for bb4 dye this same profile was observed with growing temperatures from 25 to 35 c however the decay of the membrane s adsorption capacity at higher temperature ranges suggests that another process may be taking place previous studies 4 indicated that at higher temperatures there is an increase in the oscillatory energy of molecules adsorbed on solid surfaces due to the rise in the medium energy sufficient to supply the interactive adsorbent adsorbate forces facilitating the migration of contaminant molecules to the surface solution thus as the bb4 molecules are larger than the bb7 molecules fig 5 the increase in temperature facilitates the desorption of this dye from the solid to the medium for db22 dye the decrease in membrane adsorption potential with increasing temperature can be associated with two factors first the ascending temperature increases the dye molecules oscillatory energy hampering the adsorbent adsorbate interactions 29 second given the medium s acidity the temperature increase can lead to acid hydrolysis at the membrane surface 30 in this process the cn groups of the membrane are protonated culminating in the material s electronegativity reduction as discussed earlier at ph 2 the oxygenated anions of the dye are also protonated 31 thus there is an increase in electrostatic repulsive forces between adsorbent adsorbate with increasing temperature thus the optimized temperatures are 25 c for the db22 dye and 35 c for the bb7 and bb4 dyes 3 3 adsorption kinetics the adsorption kinetics of the three dyes was studied under the optimized conditions of each contaminant varying the initial concentration of bb7 bb4 and db22 50 400 mg l 1 for 12 h pseudo first order 32 pseudo second order 33 and intraparticle diffusion 34 kinetic models were fitted to the adsorption curves in linear and non linear forms and calculations were performed for average relative error are values calculated using linearized kinetic models were selected because they have lower are therefore the graphs for the best linear fits of each contaminant and the calculated parameters of the models are presented in fig s3 and table 2 respectively the criterion to determine the best model involved the highest value of r2 and the lowest variance between the calculated qe and the experimental qe the results indicated the intraparticle diffusion model fit the experimental data for three dyes with r2 values ranging from 0 96 to 0 98 0 92 0 97 and 0 92 0 98 for the dyes bb7 bb4 and db22 respectively this model infers that in addition to adsorption the interactive adsorbent adsorbate system occurs through mass transfer the contaminant diffuses from an external layer the internal structure of the material 35 corroborating the characterizations carried out in hpan go sf table 1 which showed that the membrane is a porous material 89 55 porosity with asymmetric and thickened finger like sublayer regarding the other models bb7 and db22 data were better adjusted to the pseudo first order kinetic model with calculated qe similar to the experimental one and r2 values 0 90 in comparison the pseudo second order kinetic model fitted better the bb4 adsorption data these results indicate that the occupancy rate of the hpan go sf surface interaction sites by the bb7 and db22 dyes is proportional to the amount of unoccupied centers on the membrane while for the bb4 dye this occupancy is proportional to the square of the numbers of unoccupied active sites in the solid 36 3 4 effect of nacl on bb7 bb4 and db22 adsorption the recurrent presence of chloride in surface waters highlights the need to study the adsorption equilibrium of new materials in multi component systems under these conditions due to competition for substrate interaction centers between the ions and the pollutants present in the medium there can be significant variation in the adsorption potential of the solid 37 this work investigated the removal of bb7 bb4 and db22 dyes by the adsorption on the membrane in the presence of nacl salt the parameters defined for the study were based on the membrane optimization conditions and the concentration of 100 mg l 1 of nacl fig 3 as indicated in the analysis fig 3 the presence of salt in the medium resulted in a marked decrease in the adsorption capacity for the cationic dyes and a slight increase in the removal of anionic dye the qe decreased from 205 4 to 127 5 mg g 1 38 and from 388 7 to 250 9 mg g 1 35 for bb7 and bb4 respectively and increased from 71 9 to 82 8 mg g 1 15 for db22 dye for cationic dyes these results indicate competition for the centers of membrane interaction between contaminant molecules and salt ions in the medium 18 the 38 and 35 decrease in adsorbent adsorbate interactions between hpan go sf and bb7 and bb4 correspond to electrostatic interactions ion exchange and hydrogen bonds this suggests that for these systems 60 of the interactions are attributed to π π and hydrophobic interactions a like result was observed by silva et al 18 when evaluating the effect of saline medium on the adsorption of bb7 complex dye in nanocellulose go nanocomposite the slight increase in the adsorption capacity of db22 by hpan go sf in a saline medium indicates that the adsorbent adsorbate interactions are enhanced under this condition the surplus of na cations in the solution could induce the covering of the membrane surface through electrostatic interactions with coo making the membrane less electronically rich and more accessible to interact with the negatively charged db22 dye similar results were obtained by quezada et al 38 when evaluating the adsorption of an anionic polyelectrolyte on quartz surface in saline medium according to the authors the na cations protected the coo groups of the polyelectrolyte and adhered to the solid surface in turn these effects provided greater proximity between the materials favoring interactions by cationic bridge and hydrogen bonds between the polyelectrolyte and quartz 38 to interpret how the presence of nacl affects the adsorption equilibrium of the membrane for the dyes the adsorption isotherm study of the contaminants in saline medium was performed the langmuir 39 freundlich 40 temkin 41 and henry 42 isothermal models were fitted to the adsorption data in linear and non linear forms and calculations were conducted referring to the average relative error are the values calculated by the linearized isothermal models were selected since they showed lower are therefore the fit of the linearized models to the empirical data and the calculated values for each isotherm are presented in fig s4 and table 3 respectively the criterion for determining the best model involved a higher value of r2 the results revealed that the temkin model offered a better fit to the empirical data of the bb7 and bb4 dyes with r2 of 0 9287 and 0 9296 respectively and the henry model was the best adjusted to db22 data with r2 of 0 9057 the temkin isotherm postulates that adsorbent adsorbate interactions resulting from the coverage of the solid by the contaminant molecules linearly reduce the heat of adsorption of the interactive process thus the adsorptive process is expressed by a binding energies regular distribution and when maximum the system saturation is reached 43 regarding the henry model at low concentrations of adsorbate it expresses that the adsorbent adsorbate interactions are reduced due to the high affinity of the solute to the solvent and when at high concentrations this model fits the langmuir isotherm 44 the langmuir isotherm adopts that the adsorbent adsorbate interactions are independent of the surface area of the solid restricting themselves to occur at interactions centers on the adsorbent and that the maximum saturation occurs when a monomolecular layer of the adsorbate completely covers the surface of the solid 45 thus db22 dye when at low concentration in the medium has a higher affinity with the solvent than to the hpan go sf membrane while at high concentrations possibly due to the size of the contaminant molecule and its affinity for the medium only a saturated monolayer of the db22 dye is formed on the membrane 3 5 reuse tests linked to the reuse of the solid and the operational cost of the process the replicability of new materials in further adsorption assays without loss of efficiency is an important parameter to be evaluated 46 thus reuse tests were carried out in five consecutive cycles with hpan go sf membranes using acidic ph 2 and basic ph 12 solutions and organic solvents acetone and ethyl alcohol as eluents in the desorption step the general results of the adsorption of bb7 bb4 and db22 dyes in consecutive cycles for the different eluent solvents can be seen in fig s5 and fig 4 summarizes the best results for the three contaminants in the assays in the adsorption assays the maximum adsorption capacity of the cationic dyes was reached at ph 6 and of the anionic dye at ph 2 which leads us to believe that contaminating molecules adhered to the material can be easily removed in acidic and basic solutions respectively 47 as expected the best membrane reuse efficiency for the cationic dyes was achieved using an acidic medium as eluent solvent while for the anionic dye this profile was reached using basic conditions the reason is that in an acidic solution the protonation of the nitrogen and oxygen groups of the membrane due to the excess of protons on the surface of the material results in electrostatic repulsion between the molecules of the cationic dye and the adsorbent 48 facilitating desorption in the other case excess oh ions deprotonate the oxygenated groups of the anionic dye and the functional groups of hpan go sf increasing the adsorbent adsorbate repulsive forces 49 for bb7 fig 4 the hpan go sf membrane maintained its dye uptake efficiency at 100 even after five cycles of reuse regarding bb4 fig 4 the membrane efficiency was maintained at 100 until the 4th cycle of solid reuse in the fifth test the material s performance dropped 16 from the previous cycle even with a small loss of adsorption capacity the membrane removal efficiency of 74 was higher compared to other materials in the literature used in only one adsorption cycle 50 for db22 fig 4 hpan go sf showed 100 efficiency in up to 3 reuse cycles showing a 53 drop in the fourth test and another 24 drop in the last cycle the decrease in membrane removal efficiency for the anionic dye may be associated with the adsorbent adsorbate interaction strength in addition to electrostatic interactions ion exchange is commonly present in interactions between oppositely charged objects 18 this mechanism raises the enthalpy of binding 51 increasing the energy required to segregate the systems which culminates in reduced efficiency of the material recycling 3 6 adsorption mechanism based on dft study and ft ir xps and sem analyses 3 6 1 dft study the dye molecules formulations were optimized using the functional hybrid b3lyp and two sets of 6 31g bases were compared to verify which one achieved the lowest molecule energy more stable structure for each dye according to fig s6 for bb7 and bb4 6 31g d p obtained slightly lower energies than 6 31g d p being used to perform the molecular orbital mo calculations for db22 6 31g d p was the base set applied to the mo simulations because convergence criteria were not met using 6 31g d p applied to mo calculations the optimized geometries are shown in fig 5 where the largest dimension of bb7 bb4 and db22 molecules is 16 1 å 18 3 å and 36 1 å respectively fig 5a shows bb7 as a triarylmethane dye with a naphthylamine group the structure has the triarylmethane rings twisted together due to repulsion forces giving the molecule a non planar geometry bb4 fig 5b presents a planar conformation with a double azo group disazo dye connecting the methyl benzene diamine groups and the central toluene group db22 fig 5c in turn is a sulfonated azo dye that has the flat shape and length characteristic of direct dyes that maximizes van der waals interactions and dipole hydrogen bonds to cellulose fibers 52 the three molecules electrostatic potential esp map is shown in fig 5 where the blue color represents positively charged areas and the red represents the negative regions clark et al 53 mention that the positive charge of cationic dyes can be located in ammonium groups or it can be arranged as a delocalized charge on the dye cation as found in triarylmethanes which corroborates the simulation results of bb7 fig 5a and bb4 fig 5b for db22 fig 5c the negative charge is concentrated around the sulfonated groups the other regions are at most uncharged like the extremities of the molecule the dipole moment of each dye is 5 5 2 2 and 43 4 debye for bb4 bb7 and db22 respectively fig 6 shows a rendering of the homo and lumo orbitals of bb7 bb4 and db22 molecules homo and lumo show the regions of a molecule that can donor or receive electrons respectively 54 homo and lumo are the principal orbitals in a chemical reaction 55 the homo energy is immediately associated with the ionization capacity and the lumo energy to the electron affinity 56 thus they indicate the reactivity stability of the structures and determine how the molecule interacts with other species which is relevant information to describe adsorption mechanisms for bb7 fig 6a homo is more concentrated in the naphthylamine group and in one of the arylamine groups the lumo density occurs over the three arylamine structures where electrophilic interactions with the adsorbent occur in the bb4 molecule fig 6b the homo and lumo densities are distributed throughout the molecule indicating that any region can accept and donate electrons being prone to both electrophilic and nucleophilic interactions with the adsorbent functional groups in db22 fig 6c the homo energy density is homogeneously dispersed in all aromatic rings and lumo is intensified in the central rings of the molecule and the homo and lumo orbitals do not present electrical density in the so3 group as also found by nemr et al 57 comparing the energy gap values of bb4 bb7 and db22 3 1 2 5 and 2 49 ev respectively the most stable less reactive compound is bb4 which has the greater energy gap the larger the boundary orbitals the more energetically unfavorable the energy gap is in adding an electron to the high lying lumo and remove electrons from the low lying homo 58 bb7 and db22 have similar boundary orbital energy gaps other quantum chemical parameters based on the homo and lumo energies eqs s3 s5 are presented in table 4 such as chemical potential μ electron escaping tendency global chemical hardness η resistance to change in electronic density electrophilicity index ω electron accepting ability 59 61 comparing the values of μ η and ω for the dyes bb7 showed the highest chemical potential μ 4 3 ev which means a greater tendency to lose electrons followed by bb4 μ 3 8 ev and db22 μ 3 8 ev bb4 is the hardest molecule η 1 6 ev meaning it is more resistant to change in its electronic density which agrees with the energy gap conclusion that bb4 is the most stable molecule among the three dyes the ω 7 5 ev of bb7 confirmed the greater electrophilic nature of this dye the intermediary electrophilicity index of db22 5 6 ev suggests that despite the negative charge of the compound in aqueous solution this dye has a more remarkable ability to accept electrons than bb4 a cationic species this may be related to the high chemical hardness of bb4 which makes significant changes in charge density these results suggest that the adsorption potential of the hpan go sf membrane by π π interactions should be higher for db22 dye the most reactive molecule than for bb7 and bb4 dyes however the adsorption assays indicated that bb4 was the dye best removed by the membrane 2 5 mmol g 1 followed by bb7 1 7 mmol g 1 and db22 0 2 mmol g 1 table 4 these divergences between the calculated data and results obtained in the adsorption experiments suggest that besides π stacking 62 other interactions may be predominant in removing the dyes by hpan go sf the adsorption tests indicated the presence of electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonds in removing dyes through the membrane in agreement the tests in saline media when demonstrating that the presence of ions influenced the adsorbent adsorbate interactions confirmed the presence of electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonding between the membrane and dyes which were estimated at 38 35 and 15 for bb7 bb4 and db22 dyes fig 3 respectively regarding electrostatic interactions the hpan go sf membrane due to its electronegative surface charge has a greater affinity for cationic dyes and corroborating the dft study the bb7 molecules having cations homogeneously distributed along their structure present a higher electrostatic potential than bb4 molecules with have localized cations regarding hydrogen bonds as the contaminant molecules bb7 and bb4 have nh and oh groups in their structure they can interact the membrane carboxyl groups 63 because it is proximity based binding this type of interaction is difficult for db22 and bb7 molecules for the anionic dye the electrostatic repulsions hinder the adsorbent adsorbate proximity for the cationic bb7 dye the four aromatic rings attached to the nitrogen groups in the structure cause a steric hindrance to form the oh nh groups to the coo of hpan go sf thus hydrogen bonds are more effective between the bb4 dye molecules and the material regarding π stacking the bb7 dye has a nucleus with 4 aromatic rings triarylmethane group presenting a large rigid three dimensional structure making it challenging to pair the molecule of contaminant and the benzyl groups of the membrane 64 on the other hand the bb4 and db22 molecules because they have a smaller nucleus with a linear structure have greater mobility enabling different conformations between adsorbent adsorbate and consequently facilitating the π π interactions the discussions held above indicated that bb4 interacts with hpan go sf through h bonding electrostatic and π π interactions while the bb7 and db22 dyes do so through electrostatic and π π interactions which denotes the best membrane removal potential for bb4 followed by bb7 and db22 for db22 the adsorbent adsorbate electrostatic repulsions indicative a decrease in the membrane adsorption potential for the contaminant the three dimensional structure of the compound and the large molecule size may contribute to the steric impediment of the compound on the hpan go sf surface 65 3 6 2 ft ir xps and sem post adsorption processing analyses to further explore the possible mechanisms of dye interactions with hpan go sf membranes in addition to the dft study ftir xps and sem analyses were carried out on post adsorption materials ftir analysis was employed to delineate variations in membrane functional groups according to dye adsorption onto the structure fig 7 analyzing the hpan go sf ft ir spectrum black line fig 7 it was possible to denote functional groups characteristic of the partially hydrolyzed polymer and go sf the broad signal in the region of 3436 cm 1 the small bands at 2931 and 2864 cm 1 and the sharp vibration at 2240 cm 1 are associated to oh stretching the symmetrical and asymmetrical bending of ch units and nitriles cn respectively 10 the bands centered at 1696 1573 1457 1398 1222 and 1074 cm 1 are assigned to cc nh ch2 bonds oh inflections co inflections and coc elongations respectively 66 these conformations were also observed in the membrane spectra with the adsorbed dyes bb7 red line fig 7 bb4 blue line fig 7 and db22 pink line fig 7 except for some variations such as displacement convalescence and appearance of bands these changes indicate the existence of interactions between adsorbent adsorbate the bands associated to oh 3436 cm 1 and nh 1573 cm 1 in the hpan go sf spectrum blue shifted to 3428 3424 and 3420 cm 1 and 1568 1567 and 1587 cm 1 in the membrane spectra with bb7 bb4 and db22 adsorbed respectively fig 7 this indicate the existence of adsorbent adsorbate h bonding and variations in the counter ions related to the oxygenated groups of membrane and db22 and the nitrogenous groups of bb7 and bb4 67 furthermore the hpan gosf band shifted at 1696 cm 1 to 1646 1691 and 1684 cm 1 for bb7 bb4 and db22 dyes respectively fig 7 suggesting the attendance of π stacking between adsorbent adsorbate 68 xps analysis was used to evaluate how adsorption of the dyes influenced the elemental arrangement of the membranes table 5 as well as to obtain information on the chemical bonds between the material and the dyes fig 8 the xps spectrum table 5 indicated the attendance of elements c o n na and cl in 75 6 11 0 12 6 0 2 and 0 6 for hpan go sf 2 and 76 4 10 3 12 5 0 1 and 0 7 for the membrane incorporated with 6 of go sf the proportion of these elements in membranes with loaded dyes varied indicating the presence of contaminants in the membrane regarding the membrane adsorbed bb4 table 5 the contents of c n o cl and na were 73 5 16 0 10 0 0 3 and 0 2 respectively the rise in n was expected since the dye is endowed with nitrogen groups in its structure for the membrane incorporated with 6 of go sf adsorbed bb7 table 5 the contents were 72 1 17 0 17 0 0 6 and 0 1 were found for the elements described above respectively indicating that like bb4 bb7 is endowed with n the hpan go sf 6 loaded with db22 table 5 showed 71 0 14 1 12 3 2 4 0 1 and 0 1 for c n o s na and cl respectively the enhancement of o and n and advent of the s element indicated the presence of db22 dye in the material furthermore a decrease in the cl content of the membrane with anionic dye indicates that there was anion exchange between the oxygen groups of the dye and the cl in the sf 67 attesting to the adsorption of db22 to the membrane deconvolution of the high resolution c1s spectra of membranes with loaded dyes fig 8a c e indicated changes in peak intensities as well as variations in binding energy indicating possible adsorbent adsorbate interactions changes in binding energy related to the ethylene groups from 284 2 ev table 1 to 284 0 284 3 and 284 6 ev for the db22 bb4 and bb7 respectively indicate the attendance of π π interactions of contaminating phenyl groups and the membrane 68 changes in signals related to co cn from 285 1 ev table 1 to 285 3 285 7 and 285 9 ev for db22 bb7 and bb4 respectively suggest hydrogen bonds between the dyes and hpan go sf 69 variations in the co binding energy from 287 2 ev table 1 to 287 6 287 3 and 287 5 ev for bb7 bb4 and db22 respectively indicate that carbonyl functional groups acted as hydrogen bond acceptor 70 the n1s high resolution xps spectrum of membrane after adsorption fig 8b d f showed shifts in binding energies and peak intensities variation for each dye indicating the participation of n as an electron acceptor in hydrogen bonds 18 the peaks concerning to the cn c n and c n nco groups shifted from 399 2 and 399 9 ev table 1 to 399 7 and 400 0 ev for bb7 399 1 and 400 4 ev for bb4 and 399 1 and 400 1 ev for db22 respectively 71 these results indicate that nitrogen functions have a significant impact on the adsorption process due to h bonding sem analysis was also performed to investigate the morphology of the membranes after adsorption fig 9 the images obtained indicated the attendance of dyes on the membrane surface highlighting the contaminants as light gray particles on the dark gray material furthermore by the technique it is clear that the mass of the adsorbed bb7 and bb4 dyes is greater than for db22 dye since the images show higher concentration of dye per membrane area for the cationic dye crystal these results corroborate the tests performed which showed that the hpan go sf membrane has an average adsorption capacity of 1143 1 873 7 and 204 9 mg g 1 for bb4 bb7 and db22 respectively 3 6 3 hpan go sf adsorption mechanism the hpan go sf membrane when used in singular systems for the removal of bb7 bb4 and db22 dyes showed expressive adsorption capacity due to adsorbent adsorbent interactions the optimization study suggested that electrostatic and π π interactions were critical in the adsorption of the dye by the membrane corroborating these perspectives the assay in saline medium revealed that 38 35 and 15 of the interactive processes between hpan go sf and the dyes are by electrostatic interactions and h bonding 72 dft study showed that π π govern the process and are most expressive for the dye db22 post adsorption characterizations confirmed that ion exchange h bonding π stacking and electrostatic interactions rule adsorption mechanisms with electrostatic and π π interactions being the main ones fig 10 the maximum qe of hpan go sf for the bb4 bb7 and db22 dyes of 1143 1 873 7 and 204 9 mg g 1 indicated the remarkable removal potential of the membranes which obtained values higher than most tridimensional materials reported in the literature table 6 in general for the materials used in the literature table 6 the new membranes presented greater mass and even in these circumstances hpan go sf stood out from the others 4 conclusions in this study go based polymeric membranes functionalized with sf dye were applied to treat complex dyes such as the cationic dyes bb7 and bb4 and the anionic dye db22 from water the membrane hpan go sf was used in batch assays because previous studies showed that its selectivity varied with permeate flux and due to facile removal of the material post process from the aqueous solution the optimized experimental conditions indicated that the medium ph and temperature are important parameters for the dye removal by the membranes the maximum adsorption potential of 1143 1 mg g 1 873 7 mg g 1 and 204 9 mg g 1 for bb4 bb7 and db22 respectively were obtained at ph 6 and 35 c for complex cationic dyes and ph 2 and 25 c for complex anionic dye the adsorption kinetics for the single system indicated that the intraparticle diffusion model fitted the experimental data for the three dyes and the pseudo first order kinetics fitted the bb7 and db22 data while the pseudo second order kinetics fitted the bb4 s data the tests in saline medium indicated that electrostatic interactions ion exchange and hydrogen bonds were common to the adsorbent adsorbate processes and corresponded to 38 35 and 15 of the interactive processes between hpan go sf and the dyes bb7 bb4 and db22 respectively furthermore studies of the adsorption isotherm for the dyes in saline medium showed that the maximum membrane adsorption capacities for the dyes in the presence of nacl were 1035 799 and 148 mg g 1 for bb7 bb4 and db22 respectively and indicated that the interactions between the hpan go sf and the cationic dyes and the anionic dye could be expressed by the temkin and henry isothermal models respectively the dft study of the contaminants indicated that π π interactions were expected in the process and that the most reactive dye was db22 followed by bb7 and bb4 respectively experimental adsorption data and ftir xps and sem analyses performed post adsorption processing showed that ion exchange hydrogen bonding π π and electrostatic interactions govern the system thus from the mechanisms linked to the interactive process between the membrane and the dyes electrostatic and π π interactions stand out the material maintained the high removal efficiency even after 3 cycles of reuse confirmimg the weak bonds of adsorbent adsorbate polarization the potential of the membrane for dye removal was attested by other 3d materials indicating the effectiveness of the new material credit authorship contribution statement tauany de figueiredo neves

12748,the difficulty in metabolizing and degrading complex dyes containing three or more aromatic rings ascends new alternatives in the treatment of colored water including adsorption despite advances in this area the adsorption of complex dyes has been little reported in this work polyacrylonitrile membranes incorporated with graphene oxide functionalized with safranin dye hpan go sf were applied to remove the complex cationic dyes basic blue 7 bb7 and basic brown 4 bb4 and the anionic direct black 22 db22 from water the advantage of using nanoadsorbents immobilized on polymeric membranes is their easy removal after adsorption under the best conditions established for dye removal high adsorption capacities of 1143 1035 873 799 and 205 148 mg g 1 were achieved for bb4 bb7 and db22 in the single and saline system respectively henry and temkin s isothermal models best fitted equilibrium experimental data of dyes in single and saline systems respectively while the kinetic model of intraparticle diffusion fitted well the empirical data in both systems furthermore hpan go sf can be used for five consecutive cycles without loss of efficiency for the bb7 dye theoretical calculations and post adsorbed membrane analyses showed that the adsorbent adsorbate interactions are based on h bonding π π and electrostatic interactions graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords polymeric membranes functionalized graphene oxide complex dyes adsorption density functional theory data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction textile and clothing industries are one of the main socio economic pillars of lower middle income countries allied with the growth of this sector the presence of dyes in wastewater becomes recurrent 1 synthetic dyes industrially preferred to natural dyes are classified according to their chemical properties such as azo triarylmethane phthalocyanine anthraquinone and sulfur dyes 2 the more complex the dye the more difficult it is to decompose thus the so called complex dyes substances with more than three aromatic rings are considerably more difficult to degrade and can produce toxic metabolites 3 the cationic dyes basic blue 7 bb7 triarylmethane dye fig 1a and basic brown 4 bb4 azo dye fig 1b and the anionic dye direct black 22 db22 azo dye fig 1c are some of the complex dyes commonly used in the dyeing of natural fibers and polymeric fibers 4 despite their wide applications these recalcitrant organic contaminants usually are considered toxic mutagenic and carcinogenic and when in hydric bodies may obstruct the sunlight passage and reduce oxygen solubility 5 therefore the toxicological potentials and the resistance of dyes to degradation represent a central challenge for complex dyes removal technologies due to the complexity of their structures the removal of these dyes from water has been little explored with chemical methodologies such as photocatalysis oxidation and ozonation being the most studied however these complex and expensive processes can generate by products that are more toxic than the starting materials 6 thus the scientific community has shown great interest in treating of colored waters by adsorptive processes given the technique s advantages 7 adsorption a mass transfer phenomenon in which adsorptive molecules accumulate on the interlayer of a liquid and solid phase is a simple technique with low execution and maintenance costs and a high removal rate the adsorbent adsorbate interactions involve chemical and physical processes so the technique s performance is strictly linked to the sorbent materials used these materials must have an extensive surface area selectivity high adsorption potential and recyclability potential 8 among the various adsorbent materials used in the treatment of colored water graphene oxide go stands out go is a nanoadsorbent derived from the incomplete oxidation of graphite given its nanosheets structure of sp2 hybridized carbons with carboxyl hydroxyl and epoxide groups on the sheets it can interact with organic compounds and metallic ions 9 despite the adsorptive potential of go studies have shown that its adsorbent character can be enhanced by functionalization neves et al 10 grafted go with quaternary ammonium salt to prepare a new adsorbent with capacity of stripping bb4 dye from water the maximum removal potential of the mcs go qas adsorbent was about 650 mg g 1 although several studies have demonstrated the preparation and application of new go based nanomaterials there is a limiting factor regarding the difficulty of removing the adsorbent from water after use proposals such as immobilization of go in polymeric structures and preparation of magnetic adsorbents are some of the alternatives reported in recent years 11 among the techniques go immobilization in polymeric membranes stands out for combining two technologies in the treatment of colored water separation and adsorption 12 zhu et al 13 reported the significant potential for retention of the reactive dyes reactive red 49 97 2 and black 5 99 2 by polyethersulfone loose nanofiltration membrane incorporated with go functionalized by poly sulfobetaine methacrylate pes go psbma the use of go incorporated into polymeric membranes for adsorption of dyes in batch assays was reported once by das et al 14 they immobilized chitosan and graphene oxide into polyvinyl alcohol membrane like adsorbents and used it in congo red dye adsorption however high dose of the adsorbent was required and consequently low congo red dye adsorption capacity was achieved remaining at 12 mg g 1 recently we showed that polyacrylonitrile membranes incorporated with go hpan go and go functionalized with safranin sf dye hpan go sf 15 had great potential for removal of multiple contaminants in water even under non optimal conditions with adsorption capacities of 246 7 and 225 6 mg m 2 for basic green 4 and basic blue 26 dyes respectively in continuous flow and of 200 6 191 1 and 154 8 mg g 1 for propranolol pharmacological drug methylene blue dye and benzalkonium chloride surfactant respectively in batch assays in this study 15 we could conclude that the adsorbate s flow profile directly influences the polymeric membranes selectivity therefore despite advances in this area the adsorption of complex dyes on polymeric membranes incorporated with functionalized go has not been explored in batch assays and the adsorbent adsorbate interaction mechanisms have not been studied thus the goal of the current research was to investigate the removal potential of the cationic complex dyes bb7 and bb4 and the anionic complex dye db22 by the hpan go sf membrane in batch studies and to delineate the mechanisms that govern the interactive membrane complex dyes process therefore parameters such as solution ph adsorbent adsorbate contact time nanomaterial content in the membrane membrane amount dye concentration and medium temperature parameters were analyzed the membrane adsorption potential for complex dyes was also explored in saline medium and the regenerative ability of hpan go sf was evaluated in consecutive cycles of adsorption meanwhile kinetic and isotherm models were employed to assess the adsorbent adsorbate interactions in single system and in the presence of interfering agents furthermore studies of the membrane complex dyes interactive mechanisms were based on ftir sem and xps analyses of the membranes post adsorptive process and on density functional theory dft calculations a tool used to detail quantum systems of molecules in the ground state and relate it to the reactivity to adsorption on solid surfaces 2 experimental section information regarding this topic is presented in the supplementary material it includes the reagents and methodologies utilized for the membranes preparation and descriptions of the adsorption assays and the studies performed 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterizations in previous work 15 hpan go sf membranes were prepared and characterized a summary of the results of the characterizations performed is shown in table 1 in a previous work 15 removal tests for multiple contaminants in water were performed to evaluate how go and go sf influenced the polyacrylonitrile polymer pan adsorption capacity the results indicated that incorporating go and go sf into the polymeric matrix has provided morphological and chemical physical modifications to the pristine membrane enhancing the adsorptive character of hpan among the evaluated contaminants the new membranes stood out from the hpan go and hpan membranes for the cationic dyes bb7 and bb4 and for the anionic one db22 thus the three contaminants were selected to investigate the adsorptive potential and the interactive mechanisms of hpan go sf membranes 3 2 adsorption performances of bb7 bb4 and db22 dyes onto hpan go sf 3 2 1 initial ph effects adsorption assays were performed at various initial phs fig 2a to evaluate the influence of ph on the adsorption of dyes through the hpan go sf membrane for bb4 and db22 dyes the ph ranged from 2 to 12 while for bb7 dye the maximum ph was 8 due to its insoluble character under basic conditions 4 the adsorbent adsorbate interactions for the three contaminants were ph dependent fig 2a concerning the bb7 dye fig 2a the hpan go sf membrane provided lower adsorption at ph 2 about 48 7 mg g 1 this may be associated with protonation of the membrane nitrogen and oxygen based functions which increased the zeta potential table 1 reducing the electrostatic attractions with the cationic dye the microspecies of bb7 dye according to ph are shown in fig s2a and indicate the presence of positively charged molecules at ph 2 at ph 4 and 8 the adsorption potentials of bb7 were similar 145 2 and 132 7 mg g 1 respectively at ph 4 despite being less electronegative than at higher ph the hpan go sf membrane has an estimated surface charge of 25 8 mv table 1 while the average charge of bb7 species is 2 8 fig s2a at ph 8 the membrane surface charge dropped to 40 6 mv table 1 and dye molecules decreased to 1 0 fig s2a in both cases differences between adsorbent adsorbate charges may have generated attractive forces as indicated by the results fig 2a at ph 6 where the highest adsorption potential of the membrane was observed 173 2 mg g 1 the average charge of the dye species present in the medium is 1 03 fig s2a while hpan go sf has a decreased surface charge of 35 5 mv table 1 compared to basic conditions although the differences between the charges are similar to those estimated at ph 8 at ph 6 the presence of di cationic dye species fig s2a not present at the most basic ph may contribute to a more significant adsorbent adsorbate interaction thus as the electrostatic attraction forces are higher at ph 6 than at other phs there is closer proximity adsorbent adsorbate which enables and potentiates h bonding and π π interactions regarding bb4 dye fig 2b the hpan go sf membrane showed lower adsorption capacities at ph 2 10 and 12 median adsorption capacities at ph 4 and 8 and the highest value at ph 6 as for bb7 at ph 2 the membrane exhibited a low adsorption potential of 28 0 mg g 1 due to the protonation of the hpan go sf functional groups and the average charge of bb4 species of 2 0 fig s2b which results in electrostatic repulsions between adsorbent adsorbate at ph 10 and 12 the low adsorption potentials of 85 1 and 73 7 mg g 1 are associated to the loss of stability of the dye molecules due to the excess of oh ions in the medium 16 at ph 6 the highest membrane adsorbent potential was observed 150 3 mg g 1 in this case due to the neutrality of the medium the dye molecules tend not to precipitate as in basic ph allowing greater adsorbent adsorbate interactions also considering that in this ph range although the hpan go sf membrane has an electronegative charge surface 35 5 mv table 1 the dye species in the medium have no charge fig s2b and electrostatic forces of attraction can occur between an electrified object and a neutral object 17 furthermore as the membrane is endowed with oxygenated and nitrogenous groups in addition to the dye composed of nh2 hydrogen bond can also occur 18 further enhancing the π π and electrostatic interactions between the hpan go sf and dye at ph 4 and 8 membrane adsorption potentials were similarly expressed 120 1 and 117 4 mg g 1 respectively at ph 4 opposite charges of hpan go sf 25 8 mv table 1 and dye molecules 0 3 fig s2b generate electrostatic attraction between them enhancing the adsorbent adsorbate interactions in turn at ph 8 the presence of oh in the solution albeit at a smaller concentration than in the higher ph ranges reduces the stability of the dye thus decreasing the membrane adsorption capacity compared to ph 6 10 regarding db22 dye fig 2c the highest membrane adsorptive potential of 71 8 mg g 1 was obtained at ph 2 where most dye microspecies have charges equal to 1 fig s2c which reduces the electrostatic repulsive forces between adsorbent adsorbate furthermore as the dye and membrane have nitrogen and oxygen groups hydrogen bonds may also be present in the process 4 favoring other interactions in the system the decrease in membrane adsorptive potential from 71 8 to 2 2 mg g 1 with increasing ph 2 12 was related to an increase of oh in the medium which deprotonates the functional groups of db22 and hpan go sf providing negative charges to the dye and the membrane thus increased electrostatic repulsive forces between adsorbent adsorbate result in a decrease in membrane adsorption capacity therefore according to the ph assays ph 6 was best established for the dyes bb7 and bb4 and ph 2 for the dye db22 3 2 2 contact time effects the adsorbent adsorbate contact time influence on the process of dye removal by the hpan go sf membrane was evaluated with aliquots collected in the time interval of 0 0083 26 h fig 2b the results obtained indicated that the three dyes showed similar behavior over time initially there was a progressive increase in the adsorption potential over time with maximum potential reached in 12 h followed by stabilization of the interactive process for bb7 and bb4 hpan go sf showed higher equilibrium adsorption capacities of 178 6 mg g 1 and 150 0 mg g 1 respectively regarding db22 dye the adsorption capacity was 71 1 mg g 1 probably due electrostatic repulsion between the membrane and dye both negatively charged the differences observed between the adsorption potentials of hpan go sf for the bb7 and bb4 in relation to the db22 are associated with the surface charges of the membrane and dye species despite having a fenazinium cation due to the sf hpan go sf has a negative surface charge which contributes to attractive electrostatic interactions between the membrane and the cationic dyes and repulsive forces between the membrane and the anionic dye 19 the proximity between the membrane and the bb7 and bb4 dyes mediated by attractive forces facilitates h bonding and π π adsorbent adsorbate interactions 20 on the other hand the distance due to the electrostatic repulsions between the db22 dye and the hpan go sf membrane hinders the other interactions between contaminant and adsorbent expressed by the lower adsorptive capacity of the membrane furthermore the differences between the adsorption capacities of both cationic dyes from 178 6 mg g 1 0 35 mmol g fig 2b and 150 0 mg g 1 0 32 mmol g fig 2b for bb7 and bb4 respectively may be related to the amount of aromatic rings in each molecule while bb7 dye has four aromatic structures bb4 dye has three previous studies have shown that π π interactions are some of the strongest present between adsorbent adsorbate in adsorptive systems 21 thus as bb7 has more aromatic rings than bb4 contributes to greater π π interactions between membrane and bb7 18 as the equilibrium in dye removal by hpan go sf was reached on average in 12 h the other experiments of the optimization process were performed within this time interval 3 2 3 effect of nanomaterial content on the hpan go sf membrane the adsorbent dosage on the membrane and its relation to dye adsorption was evaluated by varying the go sf content from 0 to 10 w w fig 2c for all three dyes the results showed that embedding go sf into hpan membranes improves the adsorptive capacity of the material with qe variating 135 1 179 3 mg g 1 136 9 155 6 mg g 1 and 4 5 71 8 mg g 1 for the dyes bb7 bb4 and db22 respectively for the three dyes evaluated up to the incorporation of 6 by mass of go sf in hpan there is a progressive rise in the adsorption capacity of the new membranes and subsequently a stabilization of the material s adsorption capacity this higher efficiency is related to the increase in the adsorbent adsorbate contact surface and the higher amount of active sites on the material due to the incorporation of go sf in the membrane 22 the stabilization of the membrane adsorbent system after the addition of 6 of go sf in the material is associated with the unsaturation of the interaction centers of the spare adsorbent in the membrane 23 or even due to the clustering of go sf which by forming conglomerates reduces the membrane dye contact surface 24 thus the optimized go sf content was 6 for bb7 and db22 dyes and 2 for bb4 dye 3 2 4 influence of membrane mass variation the dye adsorption performance of the new membranes concerning their mass was evaluated with variations from 0 0005 g to 0 005 g of material in 5 ml of dye solution and the evolution of hpan go sf adsorption potential for the three dyes can be seen in the fig 2d overall for all dyes evaluated the membranes showed similar adsorption profiles there was a gradual decline in the membrane adsorption potential and a progressive rise in the contaminant percentage removal with increasing hpan go sf mass when the initial membrane mass was 0 0005 g higher qe and lower removal rate were obtained for the three dyes around 295 3 mg g 1 27 7 545 1 mg g 1 58 3 and 121 6 mg g 1 12 9 for bb7 bb4 and db22 respectively in turn for the mass of 0 005 g these values decreased for qe and increased for percentage removal around 91 5 mg g 1 83 3 78 3 mg g 1 87 5 and 35 7 mg g 1 36 6 for bb7 bb4 and db22 respectively the adsorption capacity an inherent characteristic of the material is related to the number of interactive centers available in the substrate after the tests furthermore the percentage removal is related to how much of the total contaminant is adhered to the substrate after the adsorptive process therefore the more the unsaturated interaction centers after the adsorptive process the lower the material s adsorption capacity 25 and the greater the amount of adsorbate molecules adhered to the solid 26 for the assay the greater availability of interactive centers in the adsorbent according to the rise in the material mass results in an increase in unsaturation of interaction centers and contaminating molecules adhered to hpan go sf as these amounts are inversely proportional the choice of the mass of membranes to be used in the subsequent assays must consider good qe and percentage removal thus for the bb7 and db22 dyes the optimized hpango sf membrane mass was 0 0025 g and for the bb4 dye it was 0 001 g 3 2 5 dye concentration effects the effect of the initial dye content on the adsorption capacity of hpan go sf was evaluated by ranging the concentration of bb7 bb4 and db22 dyes from 50 to 700 mg l 1 and the results obtained are presented in fig 2e the membrane adsorptive potential for the three dyes fig 2e increased with the increment of contaminant in the medium up to the material saturation around the concentration of 600 700 mg l 1 in these plateaus the adsorption capacity of hpan go sf was 873 7 1 7 mmol g 1 1143 1 2 5 mmol g 1 and 204 9 mg g 1 0 2 mmol g 1 for bb7 bb4 and db22 dyes respectively as previously discussed the increase of the adsorption potential of the membranes is related to the saturation of the active sites available in the solid after the adsorption process 10 in this case the rise in the content of contaminant molecules in the solution culminates in the filling of the interactive centers of the membrane until its complete saturation from 600 mg l 1 of dye thus the initial concentration of 100 mg l 1 of dyes was estimated for the other tests 3 2 6 effect of temperature variation the effect of temperature on the adsorption capacity of hpan go sf membranes was evaluated by ranging the system temperature from 25 to 55 c fig 2f the membrane adsorption efficiency for cationic dyes increases up to 35 c from 173 2 to 206 2 mg g 1 and from 319 2 to 388 7 mg g 1 for bb7 and bb4 respectively and remains constant up to 55 c for the former and decays to 335 5 mg g 1 for the latter as for db22 dye the higher the temperature the lower the membrane adsorption capacity ranging from 71 8 to 11 9 mg g 1 for the temperature range from 25 to 55 c respectively the adsorption of organic substances depends substantially on the water solubility of these compounds 27 and the increase in temperature causes an increase in the kinetic energy and mobility of the dyes promoting greater solubility and chemical potential of the compound 28 this conformity may be indicative of the endothermic process observed for the bb7 dye fig 2f the temperature rise increased the diffusion rate of the dye up to the interactive sites of the material a relationship attributed to the weakening of h bonding between solvent adsorbate and adsorbent 27 for bb4 dye this same profile was observed with growing temperatures from 25 to 35 c however the decay of the membrane s adsorption capacity at higher temperature ranges suggests that another process may be taking place previous studies 4 indicated that at higher temperatures there is an increase in the oscillatory energy of molecules adsorbed on solid surfaces due to the rise in the medium energy sufficient to supply the interactive adsorbent adsorbate forces facilitating the migration of contaminant molecules to the surface solution thus as the bb4 molecules are larger than the bb7 molecules fig 5 the increase in temperature facilitates the desorption of this dye from the solid to the medium for db22 dye the decrease in membrane adsorption potential with increasing temperature can be associated with two factors first the ascending temperature increases the dye molecules oscillatory energy hampering the adsorbent adsorbate interactions 29 second given the medium s acidity the temperature increase can lead to acid hydrolysis at the membrane surface 30 in this process the cn groups of the membrane are protonated culminating in the material s electronegativity reduction as discussed earlier at ph 2 the oxygenated anions of the dye are also protonated 31 thus there is an increase in electrostatic repulsive forces between adsorbent adsorbate with increasing temperature thus the optimized temperatures are 25 c for the db22 dye and 35 c for the bb7 and bb4 dyes 3 3 adsorption kinetics the adsorption kinetics of the three dyes was studied under the optimized conditions of each contaminant varying the initial concentration of bb7 bb4 and db22 50 400 mg l 1 for 12 h pseudo first order 32 pseudo second order 33 and intraparticle diffusion 34 kinetic models were fitted to the adsorption curves in linear and non linear forms and calculations were performed for average relative error are values calculated using linearized kinetic models were selected because they have lower are therefore the graphs for the best linear fits of each contaminant and the calculated parameters of the models are presented in fig s3 and table 2 respectively the criterion to determine the best model involved the highest value of r2 and the lowest variance between the calculated qe and the experimental qe the results indicated the intraparticle diffusion model fit the experimental data for three dyes with r2 values ranging from 0 96 to 0 98 0 92 0 97 and 0 92 0 98 for the dyes bb7 bb4 and db22 respectively this model infers that in addition to adsorption the interactive adsorbent adsorbate system occurs through mass transfer the contaminant diffuses from an external layer the internal structure of the material 35 corroborating the characterizations carried out in hpan go sf table 1 which showed that the membrane is a porous material 89 55 porosity with asymmetric and thickened finger like sublayer regarding the other models bb7 and db22 data were better adjusted to the pseudo first order kinetic model with calculated qe similar to the experimental one and r2 values 0 90 in comparison the pseudo second order kinetic model fitted better the bb4 adsorption data these results indicate that the occupancy rate of the hpan go sf surface interaction sites by the bb7 and db22 dyes is proportional to the amount of unoccupied centers on the membrane while for the bb4 dye this occupancy is proportional to the square of the numbers of unoccupied active sites in the solid 36 3 4 effect of nacl on bb7 bb4 and db22 adsorption the recurrent presence of chloride in surface waters highlights the need to study the adsorption equilibrium of new materials in multi component systems under these conditions due to competition for substrate interaction centers between the ions and the pollutants present in the medium there can be significant variation in the adsorption potential of the solid 37 this work investigated the removal of bb7 bb4 and db22 dyes by the adsorption on the membrane in the presence of nacl salt the parameters defined for the study were based on the membrane optimization conditions and the concentration of 100 mg l 1 of nacl fig 3 as indicated in the analysis fig 3 the presence of salt in the medium resulted in a marked decrease in the adsorption capacity for the cationic dyes and a slight increase in the removal of anionic dye the qe decreased from 205 4 to 127 5 mg g 1 38 and from 388 7 to 250 9 mg g 1 35 for bb7 and bb4 respectively and increased from 71 9 to 82 8 mg g 1 15 for db22 dye for cationic dyes these results indicate competition for the centers of membrane interaction between contaminant molecules and salt ions in the medium 18 the 38 and 35 decrease in adsorbent adsorbate interactions between hpan go sf and bb7 and bb4 correspond to electrostatic interactions ion exchange and hydrogen bonds this suggests that for these systems 60 of the interactions are attributed to π π and hydrophobic interactions a like result was observed by silva et al 18 when evaluating the effect of saline medium on the adsorption of bb7 complex dye in nanocellulose go nanocomposite the slight increase in the adsorption capacity of db22 by hpan go sf in a saline medium indicates that the adsorbent adsorbate interactions are enhanced under this condition the surplus of na cations in the solution could induce the covering of the membrane surface through electrostatic interactions with coo making the membrane less electronically rich and more accessible to interact with the negatively charged db22 dye similar results were obtained by quezada et al 38 when evaluating the adsorption of an anionic polyelectrolyte on quartz surface in saline medium according to the authors the na cations protected the coo groups of the polyelectrolyte and adhered to the solid surface in turn these effects provided greater proximity between the materials favoring interactions by cationic bridge and hydrogen bonds between the polyelectrolyte and quartz 38 to interpret how the presence of nacl affects the adsorption equilibrium of the membrane for the dyes the adsorption isotherm study of the contaminants in saline medium was performed the langmuir 39 freundlich 40 temkin 41 and henry 42 isothermal models were fitted to the adsorption data in linear and non linear forms and calculations were conducted referring to the average relative error are the values calculated by the linearized isothermal models were selected since they showed lower are therefore the fit of the linearized models to the empirical data and the calculated values for each isotherm are presented in fig s4 and table 3 respectively the criterion for determining the best model involved a higher value of r2 the results revealed that the temkin model offered a better fit to the empirical data of the bb7 and bb4 dyes with r2 of 0 9287 and 0 9296 respectively and the henry model was the best adjusted to db22 data with r2 of 0 9057 the temkin isotherm postulates that adsorbent adsorbate interactions resulting from the coverage of the solid by the contaminant molecules linearly reduce the heat of adsorption of the interactive process thus the adsorptive process is expressed by a binding energies regular distribution and when maximum the system saturation is reached 43 regarding the henry model at low concentrations of adsorbate it expresses that the adsorbent adsorbate interactions are reduced due to the high affinity of the solute to the solvent and when at high concentrations this model fits the langmuir isotherm 44 the langmuir isotherm adopts that the adsorbent adsorbate interactions are independent of the surface area of the solid restricting themselves to occur at interactions centers on the adsorbent and that the maximum saturation occurs when a monomolecular layer of the adsorbate completely covers the surface of the solid 45 thus db22 dye when at low concentration in the medium has a higher affinity with the solvent than to the hpan go sf membrane while at high concentrations possibly due to the size of the contaminant molecule and its affinity for the medium only a saturated monolayer of the db22 dye is formed on the membrane 3 5 reuse tests linked to the reuse of the solid and the operational cost of the process the replicability of new materials in further adsorption assays without loss of efficiency is an important parameter to be evaluated 46 thus reuse tests were carried out in five consecutive cycles with hpan go sf membranes using acidic ph 2 and basic ph 12 solutions and organic solvents acetone and ethyl alcohol as eluents in the desorption step the general results of the adsorption of bb7 bb4 and db22 dyes in consecutive cycles for the different eluent solvents can be seen in fig s5 and fig 4 summarizes the best results for the three contaminants in the assays in the adsorption assays the maximum adsorption capacity of the cationic dyes was reached at ph 6 and of the anionic dye at ph 2 which leads us to believe that contaminating molecules adhered to the material can be easily removed in acidic and basic solutions respectively 47 as expected the best membrane reuse efficiency for the cationic dyes was achieved using an acidic medium as eluent solvent while for the anionic dye this profile was reached using basic conditions the reason is that in an acidic solution the protonation of the nitrogen and oxygen groups of the membrane due to the excess of protons on the surface of the material results in electrostatic repulsion between the molecules of the cationic dye and the adsorbent 48 facilitating desorption in the other case excess oh ions deprotonate the oxygenated groups of the anionic dye and the functional groups of hpan go sf increasing the adsorbent adsorbate repulsive forces 49 for bb7 fig 4 the hpan go sf membrane maintained its dye uptake efficiency at 100 even after five cycles of reuse regarding bb4 fig 4 the membrane efficiency was maintained at 100 until the 4th cycle of solid reuse in the fifth test the material s performance dropped 16 from the previous cycle even with a small loss of adsorption capacity the membrane removal efficiency of 74 was higher compared to other materials in the literature used in only one adsorption cycle 50 for db22 fig 4 hpan go sf showed 100 efficiency in up to 3 reuse cycles showing a 53 drop in the fourth test and another 24 drop in the last cycle the decrease in membrane removal efficiency for the anionic dye may be associated with the adsorbent adsorbate interaction strength in addition to electrostatic interactions ion exchange is commonly present in interactions between oppositely charged objects 18 this mechanism raises the enthalpy of binding 51 increasing the energy required to segregate the systems which culminates in reduced efficiency of the material recycling 3 6 adsorption mechanism based on dft study and ft ir xps and sem analyses 3 6 1 dft study the dye molecules formulations were optimized using the functional hybrid b3lyp and two sets of 6 31g bases were compared to verify which one achieved the lowest molecule energy more stable structure for each dye according to fig s6 for bb7 and bb4 6 31g d p obtained slightly lower energies than 6 31g d p being used to perform the molecular orbital mo calculations for db22 6 31g d p was the base set applied to the mo simulations because convergence criteria were not met using 6 31g d p applied to mo calculations the optimized geometries are shown in fig 5 where the largest dimension of bb7 bb4 and db22 molecules is 16 1 å 18 3 å and 36 1 å respectively fig 5a shows bb7 as a triarylmethane dye with a naphthylamine group the structure has the triarylmethane rings twisted together due to repulsion forces giving the molecule a non planar geometry bb4 fig 5b presents a planar conformation with a double azo group disazo dye connecting the methyl benzene diamine groups and the central toluene group db22 fig 5c in turn is a sulfonated azo dye that has the flat shape and length characteristic of direct dyes that maximizes van der waals interactions and dipole hydrogen bonds to cellulose fibers 52 the three molecules electrostatic potential esp map is shown in fig 5 where the blue color represents positively charged areas and the red represents the negative regions clark et al 53 mention that the positive charge of cationic dyes can be located in ammonium groups or it can be arranged as a delocalized charge on the dye cation as found in triarylmethanes which corroborates the simulation results of bb7 fig 5a and bb4 fig 5b for db22 fig 5c the negative charge is concentrated around the sulfonated groups the other regions are at most uncharged like the extremities of the molecule the dipole moment of each dye is 5 5 2 2 and 43 4 debye for bb4 bb7 and db22 respectively fig 6 shows a rendering of the homo and lumo orbitals of bb7 bb4 and db22 molecules homo and lumo show the regions of a molecule that can donor or receive electrons respectively 54 homo and lumo are the principal orbitals in a chemical reaction 55 the homo energy is immediately associated with the ionization capacity and the lumo energy to the electron affinity 56 thus they indicate the reactivity stability of the structures and determine how the molecule interacts with other species which is relevant information to describe adsorption mechanisms for bb7 fig 6a homo is more concentrated in the naphthylamine group and in one of the arylamine groups the lumo density occurs over the three arylamine structures where electrophilic interactions with the adsorbent occur in the bb4 molecule fig 6b the homo and lumo densities are distributed throughout the molecule indicating that any region can accept and donate electrons being prone to both electrophilic and nucleophilic interactions with the adsorbent functional groups in db22 fig 6c the homo energy density is homogeneously dispersed in all aromatic rings and lumo is intensified in the central rings of the molecule and the homo and lumo orbitals do not present electrical density in the so3 group as also found by nemr et al 57 comparing the energy gap values of bb4 bb7 and db22 3 1 2 5 and 2 49 ev respectively the most stable less reactive compound is bb4 which has the greater energy gap the larger the boundary orbitals the more energetically unfavorable the energy gap is in adding an electron to the high lying lumo and remove electrons from the low lying homo 58 bb7 and db22 have similar boundary orbital energy gaps other quantum chemical parameters based on the homo and lumo energies eqs s3 s5 are presented in table 4 such as chemical potential μ electron escaping tendency global chemical hardness η resistance to change in electronic density electrophilicity index ω electron accepting ability 59 61 comparing the values of μ η and ω for the dyes bb7 showed the highest chemical potential μ 4 3 ev which means a greater tendency to lose electrons followed by bb4 μ 3 8 ev and db22 μ 3 8 ev bb4 is the hardest molecule η 1 6 ev meaning it is more resistant to change in its electronic density which agrees with the energy gap conclusion that bb4 is the most stable molecule among the three dyes the ω 7 5 ev of bb7 confirmed the greater electrophilic nature of this dye the intermediary electrophilicity index of db22 5 6 ev suggests that despite the negative charge of the compound in aqueous solution this dye has a more remarkable ability to accept electrons than bb4 a cationic species this may be related to the high chemical hardness of bb4 which makes significant changes in charge density these results suggest that the adsorption potential of the hpan go sf membrane by π π interactions should be higher for db22 dye the most reactive molecule than for bb7 and bb4 dyes however the adsorption assays indicated that bb4 was the dye best removed by the membrane 2 5 mmol g 1 followed by bb7 1 7 mmol g 1 and db22 0 2 mmol g 1 table 4 these divergences between the calculated data and results obtained in the adsorption experiments suggest that besides π stacking 62 other interactions may be predominant in removing the dyes by hpan go sf the adsorption tests indicated the presence of electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonds in removing dyes through the membrane in agreement the tests in saline media when demonstrating that the presence of ions influenced the adsorbent adsorbate interactions confirmed the presence of electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonding between the membrane and dyes which were estimated at 38 35 and 15 for bb7 bb4 and db22 dyes fig 3 respectively regarding electrostatic interactions the hpan go sf membrane due to its electronegative surface charge has a greater affinity for cationic dyes and corroborating the dft study the bb7 molecules having cations homogeneously distributed along their structure present a higher electrostatic potential than bb4 molecules with have localized cations regarding hydrogen bonds as the contaminant molecules bb7 and bb4 have nh and oh groups in their structure they can interact the membrane carboxyl groups 63 because it is proximity based binding this type of interaction is difficult for db22 and bb7 molecules for the anionic dye the electrostatic repulsions hinder the adsorbent adsorbate proximity for the cationic bb7 dye the four aromatic rings attached to the nitrogen groups in the structure cause a steric hindrance to form the oh nh groups to the coo of hpan go sf thus hydrogen bonds are more effective between the bb4 dye molecules and the material regarding π stacking the bb7 dye has a nucleus with 4 aromatic rings triarylmethane group presenting a large rigid three dimensional structure making it challenging to pair the molecule of contaminant and the benzyl groups of the membrane 64 on the other hand the bb4 and db22 molecules because they have a smaller nucleus with a linear structure have greater mobility enabling different conformations between adsorbent adsorbate and consequently facilitating the π π interactions the discussions held above indicated that bb4 interacts with hpan go sf through h bonding electrostatic and π π interactions while the bb7 and db22 dyes do so through electrostatic and π π interactions which denotes the best membrane removal potential for bb4 followed by bb7 and db22 for db22 the adsorbent adsorbate electrostatic repulsions indicative a decrease in the membrane adsorption potential for the contaminant the three dimensional structure of the compound and the large molecule size may contribute to the steric impediment of the compound on the hpan go sf surface 65 3 6 2 ft ir xps and sem post adsorption processing analyses to further explore the possible mechanisms of dye interactions with hpan go sf membranes in addition to the dft study ftir xps and sem analyses were carried out on post adsorption materials ftir analysis was employed to delineate variations in membrane functional groups according to dye adsorption onto the structure fig 7 analyzing the hpan go sf ft ir spectrum black line fig 7 it was possible to denote functional groups characteristic of the partially hydrolyzed polymer and go sf the broad signal in the region of 3436 cm 1 the small bands at 2931 and 2864 cm 1 and the sharp vibration at 2240 cm 1 are associated to oh stretching the symmetrical and asymmetrical bending of ch units and nitriles cn respectively 10 the bands centered at 1696 1573 1457 1398 1222 and 1074 cm 1 are assigned to cc nh ch2 bonds oh inflections co inflections and coc elongations respectively 66 these conformations were also observed in the membrane spectra with the adsorbed dyes bb7 red line fig 7 bb4 blue line fig 7 and db22 pink line fig 7 except for some variations such as displacement convalescence and appearance of bands these changes indicate the existence of interactions between adsorbent adsorbate the bands associated to oh 3436 cm 1 and nh 1573 cm 1 in the hpan go sf spectrum blue shifted to 3428 3424 and 3420 cm 1 and 1568 1567 and 1587 cm 1 in the membrane spectra with bb7 bb4 and db22 adsorbed respectively fig 7 this indicate the existence of adsorbent adsorbate h bonding and variations in the counter ions related to the oxygenated groups of membrane and db22 and the nitrogenous groups of bb7 and bb4 67 furthermore the hpan gosf band shifted at 1696 cm 1 to 1646 1691 and 1684 cm 1 for bb7 bb4 and db22 dyes respectively fig 7 suggesting the attendance of π stacking between adsorbent adsorbate 68 xps analysis was used to evaluate how adsorption of the dyes influenced the elemental arrangement of the membranes table 5 as well as to obtain information on the chemical bonds between the material and the dyes fig 8 the xps spectrum table 5 indicated the attendance of elements c o n na and cl in 75 6 11 0 12 6 0 2 and 0 6 for hpan go sf 2 and 76 4 10 3 12 5 0 1 and 0 7 for the membrane incorporated with 6 of go sf the proportion of these elements in membranes with loaded dyes varied indicating the presence of contaminants in the membrane regarding the membrane adsorbed bb4 table 5 the contents of c n o cl and na were 73 5 16 0 10 0 0 3 and 0 2 respectively the rise in n was expected since the dye is endowed with nitrogen groups in its structure for the membrane incorporated with 6 of go sf adsorbed bb7 table 5 the contents were 72 1 17 0 17 0 0 6 and 0 1 were found for the elements described above respectively indicating that like bb4 bb7 is endowed with n the hpan go sf 6 loaded with db22 table 5 showed 71 0 14 1 12 3 2 4 0 1 and 0 1 for c n o s na and cl respectively the enhancement of o and n and advent of the s element indicated the presence of db22 dye in the material furthermore a decrease in the cl content of the membrane with anionic dye indicates that there was anion exchange between the oxygen groups of the dye and the cl in the sf 67 attesting to the adsorption of db22 to the membrane deconvolution of the high resolution c1s spectra of membranes with loaded dyes fig 8a c e indicated changes in peak intensities as well as variations in binding energy indicating possible adsorbent adsorbate interactions changes in binding energy related to the ethylene groups from 284 2 ev table 1 to 284 0 284 3 and 284 6 ev for the db22 bb4 and bb7 respectively indicate the attendance of π π interactions of contaminating phenyl groups and the membrane 68 changes in signals related to co cn from 285 1 ev table 1 to 285 3 285 7 and 285 9 ev for db22 bb7 and bb4 respectively suggest hydrogen bonds between the dyes and hpan go sf 69 variations in the co binding energy from 287 2 ev table 1 to 287 6 287 3 and 287 5 ev for bb7 bb4 and db22 respectively indicate that carbonyl functional groups acted as hydrogen bond acceptor 70 the n1s high resolution xps spectrum of membrane after adsorption fig 8b d f showed shifts in binding energies and peak intensities variation for each dye indicating the participation of n as an electron acceptor in hydrogen bonds 18 the peaks concerning to the cn c n and c n nco groups shifted from 399 2 and 399 9 ev table 1 to 399 7 and 400 0 ev for bb7 399 1 and 400 4 ev for bb4 and 399 1 and 400 1 ev for db22 respectively 71 these results indicate that nitrogen functions have a significant impact on the adsorption process due to h bonding sem analysis was also performed to investigate the morphology of the membranes after adsorption fig 9 the images obtained indicated the attendance of dyes on the membrane surface highlighting the contaminants as light gray particles on the dark gray material furthermore by the technique it is clear that the mass of the adsorbed bb7 and bb4 dyes is greater than for db22 dye since the images show higher concentration of dye per membrane area for the cationic dye crystal these results corroborate the tests performed which showed that the hpan go sf membrane has an average adsorption capacity of 1143 1 873 7 and 204 9 mg g 1 for bb4 bb7 and db22 respectively 3 6 3 hpan go sf adsorption mechanism the hpan go sf membrane when used in singular systems for the removal of bb7 bb4 and db22 dyes showed expressive adsorption capacity due to adsorbent adsorbent interactions the optimization study suggested that electrostatic and π π interactions were critical in the adsorption of the dye by the membrane corroborating these perspectives the assay in saline medium revealed that 38 35 and 15 of the interactive processes between hpan go sf and the dyes are by electrostatic interactions and h bonding 72 dft study showed that π π govern the process and are most expressive for the dye db22 post adsorption characterizations confirmed that ion exchange h bonding π stacking and electrostatic interactions rule adsorption mechanisms with electrostatic and π π interactions being the main ones fig 10 the maximum qe of hpan go sf for the bb4 bb7 and db22 dyes of 1143 1 873 7 and 204 9 mg g 1 indicated the remarkable removal potential of the membranes which obtained values higher than most tridimensional materials reported in the literature table 6 in general for the materials used in the literature table 6 the new membranes presented greater mass and even in these circumstances hpan go sf stood out from the others 4 conclusions in this study go based polymeric membranes functionalized with sf dye were applied to treat complex dyes such as the cationic dyes bb7 and bb4 and the anionic dye db22 from water the membrane hpan go sf was used in batch assays because previous studies showed that its selectivity varied with permeate flux and due to facile removal of the material post process from the aqueous solution the optimized experimental conditions indicated that the medium ph and temperature are important parameters for the dye removal by the membranes the maximum adsorption potential of 1143 1 mg g 1 873 7 mg g 1 and 204 9 mg g 1 for bb4 bb7 and db22 respectively were obtained at ph 6 and 35 c for complex cationic dyes and ph 2 and 25 c for complex anionic dye the adsorption kinetics for the single system indicated that the intraparticle diffusion model fitted the experimental data for the three dyes and the pseudo first order kinetics fitted the bb7 and db22 data while the pseudo second order kinetics fitted the bb4 s data the tests in saline medium indicated that electrostatic interactions ion exchange and hydrogen bonds were common to the adsorbent adsorbate processes and corresponded to 38 35 and 15 of the interactive processes between hpan go sf and the dyes bb7 bb4 and db22 respectively furthermore studies of the adsorption isotherm for the dyes in saline medium showed that the maximum membrane adsorption capacities for the dyes in the presence of nacl were 1035 799 and 148 mg g 1 for bb7 bb4 and db22 respectively and indicated that the interactions between the hpan go sf and the cationic dyes and the anionic dye could be expressed by the temkin and henry isothermal models respectively the dft study of the contaminants indicated that π π interactions were expected in the process and that the most reactive dye was db22 followed by bb7 and bb4 respectively experimental adsorption data and ftir xps and sem analyses performed post adsorption processing showed that ion exchange hydrogen bonding π π and electrostatic interactions govern the system thus from the mechanisms linked to the interactive process between the membrane and the dyes electrostatic and π π interactions stand out the material maintained the high removal efficiency even after 3 cycles of reuse confirmimg the weak bonds of adsorbent adsorbate polarization the potential of the membrane for dye removal was attested by other 3d materials indicating the effectiveness of the new material credit authorship contribution statement tauany de figueiredo neves

compatibility with nitrifiers it was utilized as a carrier to maintain bio augmentation performance and enhance the aao s nitrogen removal results showed the bio augmented system operated stably and immobilized coal ash improved the efficiencies of nh4 n from 67 6 10 8 to 94 3 3 0 and tin from 63 2 9 2 to 84 3 4 3 an in depth analysis indicated bio augmentation altered the microbial community structures and increased the relative abundance of bacterial associated with nitrogen removal significantly increasing the abundance of nitrosomonas and nirospira in addition bio augmentation enhanced the activity of nitrogen removal enzymes especially amoabc hao nargh nirk and nosz transporter genes according to predicted function profiles network analysis between microorganisms and n metabolic functional genes revealed bio augmentation improved the complexity of network structure and the sources of n metabolic functional genes thereby enhancing functional stability return sludge flow was the most significant factor in regulating the microbial community composition associated with n removal in the bio augmented aao system followed by do and internal recycle ratio the aforementioned results obtained from the present study will enable the application of immobilized coal ash in wastewater treatment plants to improve n removal efficiency graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords nitrogen removal aao system bio augmentation microbial community structures n metabolic functional genes data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the nitrogen effluent of many municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps in china does not meet the steadily tightening sewage discharge standards nh4 n 5 mg l tn 15 mg l due to lack of organic carbon source for denitrification and slow growth and sensitivity of nitrifying bacteria for traditional nitrification 1 2 for the low c n ratio wastewater numerous methods aimed at the efficient exploitation of limited carbons have been developed over the past few decades 3 5 the primary methods for restricting the effluent ammonia of activated sludge systems are 1 pretreatment for enhancing nitrification and denitrification by deamination 6 and 2 adjusting the parameters by appropriately enlarging the dissolved oxygen do temperature etc 7 however these strategies are constrained by the high operating costs and the complexity of wwtps management taking into account management and efficiency bio augmentation is an efficient strategy for enhancing nitrogen removal by modifying microbial community 8 liang et al 9 have shown that bio augmentation with achromobacter jl9 improved n removal influencing the abundance of resistance genes and diversity of bacterial communities in a moving bed biofilm reactor however the rapid loss of inoculated microorganisms and lower rivalrousness mean that the direct dosing method has a limited effect on enhancing the n removal the fact that the growth rate of the bio microorganism is less than the washout rate will lead to poor promotion and even the failure of bio augmentation 10 11 apart from that lack of adaptation to host environmental conditions such as predation ph toxicity and competition between the inoculated and native bacteria will decrease the survival of inoculated microbes 11 it is therefore deemed necessary to investigate a novel method for preserving the inoculated microorganisms to achieve excellent bio augmentation performance coal ash a microporous material derived from power plants is widely used in soil amendments to improve bulk density water holding capacity and texture 12 it is deemed cost effective environmentally friendly and efficient for wastewater treatment as a membrane filter adsorbent photocatalyst etc due to its larger surface area and presence of multiple components 13 through the evaluation of the coal ash property it was hypothesis that coal ash can effectively enrich nitrifiers to sustain the bio augmentation capability in previous studies it has been confirmed that the immobilized coal ash can be achieved rapidly 50 of nitrifiers attached on coal ash under do and ph of 4 mg l and 8 0 conditions 14 15 however the mechanism underlying the effects of immobilized coal ash on nitrogen removal is currently unclear which pathway of biological nitrogen removal is enhanced by immobilized coal ash what is the connection between microbial internal characteristics how does the quantitative information for example enzymes of nitrogen cycle convey to address aforementioned unsolved issues the present work focuses on the nitrogen removal processes of the bio augmented anaerobic anoxic oxic aao system meanwhile the characterization of microbial communities key genes related to nitrogen cycles and their interactive relation in it were conducted in order to define the nitrogen removal mechanism of the bio augmented aao by immobilized coal ash this study clarified the mechanism of nitrogen transformation induced by immobilized coal ash 2 materials and methods 2 1 bioreactors setup and operating two lab scale aao bioreactors were set up with r1 and without immobilized coal ash r0 each aao reactor with a working volume of 16 l was seeded with activated sludge from a full scale aao wwtp in shenyang china the hydraulic retention time hrt was 8 h the mixed liquor suspended solid mlss was maintained at 3200 200 mg l under a sludge retention time srt of 20 days the aerators were installed at the bottom of the aerobic zone while the anoxic and anaerobic zones were each equipped with a vertically rotating configuration respectively do concentrations in aerobic zones were 4 5 0 5 mg l coal ash used for immobilizing nitrifiers was obtained from a power plant in shenyang china and was pretreated with acid and alkali prior to use immobilized coal ash was achieved by gradually increasing the ammonia load at a certain alkalinity and then nitrosomonas became the dominant genus attachment on the coal ash in phase i 0 71 day in order to study the impact of immobilized coal ash on aao system inoculated immobilized coal ash in r1 bioreactor was divided into two days day 0 and day 5 with a total concentration of 10 v v in oxic1 whereas r0 acted as black control without coal ash in phase ii to examine the effect of various operating conditions on microbial communities associated with n metabolism condition experiments including do return sludge flow r and internal recycle ratio r were conducted in the bio augmented and operationally stable r1 do r and r ranged between 1 4 mg l 40 100 and 100 400 respectively both aao reactors were fed by synthetic municipal wastewater with 300 mg l chemical oxygen demand cod 50 mg l nh4 n and 4 5 mg l phosphorus as shown in s2 throughout the experiment the ambient temperature was maintained at 22 1 c 2 2 chemical analysis methods the concentration of nh4 n nitrite n no2 n nitrate n no3 n and cod was determined twice daily using standard methods apha 2005 the sum of nh4 n no2 n and no3 n represented total inorganic nitrogen tin samples of effluent were filtered by a 0 45 μm filter before testing do concentrations were measured with a portable handheld do meter wtw germany each test was carried out in duplicate 2 3 sludge samples collection and amplicon sequencing analysis two sludge samples were collected from the oxic1 tanks in r0 and r1 at the end of the phase i on day 71 respectively after changing operation conditions and stabilizing the system three additional samples were taken from the oxic1 tank in r1 details concerning dna extraction and 16s rrna genes sequencing were described previously 14 the raw sequences were deposited in genbank s sequence read archive bioproject prjna 853497 2 4 statistics the statistical analyses in this study were performed with spss v 23 0 analysis of variance was applied for estimating the significant of variances concerning effluent n concentrations between reactors picrust was used to analyze the functional characteristics of the microbial community based on 16s rrna gene data all functional predictions were categorized into kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg pathways functional genes involved in n transformation metabolism were identified by the searching for ko numbers in functional annotation results gephi v0 9 2 was used to construct the co occurrence network between microbial taxa and single sample functional genes based on the kegg estimated interactions redundancy analysis rda was conducted using canoco 5 software 3 results and discussion 3 1 reactor performance fig 1 depicts the nutrients removal performance of r0 and r1 during 71 days operation nh4 n and no3 n were the main tin species in the effluent of r0 and their concentrations were 15 1 5 1 and 2 4 1 7 mg l respectively trace amounts of no2 n were detected 0 6 mg l and the average removal for nh4 n and tin was 67 6 10 8 and 63 2 9 4 respectively it can be assumed that the lack of sufficient nitrifiers for nitrification restricted further tin removal by contrast the effluent of r1 contained comparable concentrations of no2 n 0 6 0 5 mg l and no3 n 3 7 2 4 mg l while the nh4 n concentration deeply decreased from 22 5 mg l to 3 2 mg l after 21 days of inoculation day 0 and then remained stable in the following period with a concentration of 2 6 1 4 mg l and a removal efficiency of 94 3 3 0 indicating that a high efficiency aao system could be constructed rapidly the average tin removal efficiency of r1 was 84 3 4 3 showing a 21 1 improvement over the control reactor it should be noticed that the growth fluctuation occurred in r0 and r1 during the 25 to 30 days in fig 1 which responded to the increase of water inflow up to 1 3 times nevertheless that increase was more favorable in r1 indicating its greater adaptability to variation of influent which was probably a connection with a richer microbial diversity 16 as to the cod removal efficiency there was no significant difference between the two aao systems the average cod removal efficiency reached to 90 9 2 8 and 91 4 3 1 and the effluent cod concentration was 28 2 7 7 mg l and 26 9 8 8 mg l in r0 and r1 respectively revealing no significant difference p 0 05 this was put down to the presence of numerous heterotrophic microorganisms in aao systems 17 through repeated inoculations and control of operating conditions the bioaugmented aao could significantly improve its n removal while exhibiting excellent impact resistance and long term stability 3 2 spatial distribution of n and cod the variation of cod and n along both aaos was studied to clarify the contribution of each operating unit to the removal of n taking day 36 as an example fig 2 it can be seen that cod removal occurred primarily in the anaerobic zone a combination of dilution microbial adsorption and biodegradation contributed to the precipitous decline of cod in this instance in the anoxic zone the consumed cod for per unit of tin removal in r0 and r1 was 6 2 and 6 8 mg l respectively which was primarily driven by the heterotrophic denitrificaiton process in the subsequent oxic zones r0 and r1 consumed approximately 0 and 36 1 mg l cod respectively to remove per unit tin limited residual cod and different n removal contributed to the large gap between them in oxic zones which needs to be analyzed in conjunction with the transformation of n the details are discussed in section 3 4 nh4 n removal occurred predominantly in the oxic1 chamber in r1 cutting out 56 0 of the nh4 n concentration relative to the anoxic chamber which increased by 37 6 compared to r0 the concentration of nh4 n in r1 effluent then continued to decrease to 4 0 0 8 mg l this result proved that bioaugmented aao has a positive effect on nitrification rate given that do was maintained at the same level in both reactors focusing on no2 n and no3 n concentrations the negligible no2 n and no3 n 0 2 mg l were observed in r0 and r1 s anoxic chambers this was primarily caused by internal recycle and then eliminated by efficient denitrification in this unit insignificant variations of no2 n and no3 n were observed in oxic1 and oxic2 of r0 which was mainly the result of the poor nitrification according to the nh4 n concentration in contrast nh4 n no2 n and no3 n were partially removed in oxic2 of r1 allowing for a severe decline in tin concentration this result proved that simultaneous nitrification and denitrification snd was occurred in r1 that is the bioaugmentation induced n removal enhancement was primarily attributable to the ammonia oxidation and snd processes with ammonia oxidation being the limited process of nitrogen removal in this study in depth research regarding the evolution of microbial communities and n metabolic mechanisms is required 3 3 microbial community structure and functions a total of 237 and 250 otus were detected in r0 and r1 respectively among which 197 were shared by both fig 3a the mean coverage indices of these two aao systems were both 0 99 indicating an adequate coverage of the sample library chao1 and shannon indices in r1 was higher than those in r0 indicating bio augmentation slightly increased the microbial diversity phylum specific microbial communities are depicted in fig 3b the dominant phyla in both reactors were proteobacteria bacteroidetes and firmicutes accounting for over 85 while a notable decrease of proteobacteria in r1 and an increase of bacteroidetes planctomycetes firmicutes etc were observed implying that proteobacteria could be inhibited and others could be enriched by bio augmentation this microbial evolution could be responsible for r1 s excellent n removal performance fig 3c depicts the composition of microbial community at genus level nitrosomonas and nirospira classified into others in both systems were the most abundant autotrophic ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob in both systems with their increasing by 161 11 and 116 67 in r1 respectively in contrast the majority of widely reported heterotrophic nitrifying bacteria including rhodobacter r0 4 55 r1 2 67 comamonas r0 7 83 r1 3 03 acinetobacter r0 4 09 r1 3 57 decreased in abundance 18 20 autotrophic nitrifiers contributed to nh4 n removal in aao systems 2 and the change in direction of autotrophic and heterotrophic nitrifiers also confirmed this in present study the increase in autotrophic aob and nob could be an explanation for promoted nh4 n removal efficiency in r1 oxic zone furthermore various denitrifiers were indentified in both reactors including hydrogenophaga r0 5 58 r1 6 15 thauera r0 3 08 r1 0 86 and pseudomonas r0 7 02 r1 3 81 21 23 which guaranteed nitrogen removal in the form of n2 or n2o ultimately azospira r0 2 67 r1 12 52 and exiguobacterium r0 5 36 r1 8 75 the most two abundant genera in r1 were also reported to possess denitrifying capability 24 25 to be specific the relative abundance of azospira and sediminibacterium raised dramatically from 2 67 and 1 63 in r0 to 12 52 and 8 17 in r1 respectively signaling a significant facilitation in the bioaugmented aao reactor sediminibacterium were thought to be associated with wastewater and sludge 26 moreover compared with r0 the relative abundant of autotrophic denitrifiers e g exiguobacterium in r1 was viewed as a characteristic closely related to bioaugmentation and the same correlation was observed for the estimated amount of heterotrophic denitrifiers e g azospira hydrogenophaga thauera pseudomonas the interaction between native and inoculated organisms promoted the growth of the microbes unfortunately this has not previously been established 3 4 differences of n metabolic pathways n metabolism genes were investigated including nitrification denitrification assimilatory n fixation and dissimilatory nitrate reduction fig 4 the predominance of autotrophic nitrifying bacteria enhanced nitrogen transformation in r1 the relative abundances of ammonium amoabc and hydroxylamine hao transporter genes in r1 were 1 83 8 22 times higher than their counterparts in r0 in the meantime additional nh4 n could be converted from assimilatory no2 n reduction nira indicating that microbes drove the complex n cycle in line with the enhanced ammonia n uptake the relative abundance of nitrite oxidoreductase nargh increased by 3 8 compared to r0 the upregulation of ammonia n metabolic genes was consistent with the growth advantages of aob and nob in r1 fig 3c the positive influences of bio augmentation on nitrifying bacteria and nitrification related genes were ascertained resulting in an increase in ammonia removal efficiency consistent with previous studies the genes encoding no3 n reductase napab and narghi had the highest relative abundance in relation to the denitrification process 27 only the nargh and nirk genes involving in the no3 and no2 transport exhibited slightly higher in r1 3 73 compared to r0 nonetheless nitrate reductase napab nari and nitric oxide reductase norbc in denitrification pathway in r1 were inferior to those in r0 the higher content of napab and narghi may be the potential driving force for the slight accumulation of no2 in r0 figs 1 and 2 again it was proved that the limited nitrogen loss in r0 was less likely due to the absence of genes related to denitrificaiton process in this study additionally the abundance of nitrous oxide reductase nosz was reinforced in r1 demonstrating that the bioaugmented aao system was prefer to achieve a lower n2o n2 ratio as the final products of denitrification process nitrifier ntrificaiton nitrifier denitrificaiton and heterotrophic denitrifcaiton are the three major pathways for n2o formation 28 while denitrification process reduces n2o formed into n2 under conducive conditions 29 suitable no3 concentration ph and carbon availability for example 30 in terms of dissimilatory assimilatory nitrate reduction except for nargh there was a distinct improvement for nrfa nirbd and nira in r1 what is noticeable was that each of those incremental genes utilized no2 as substrate conversely nari napab and nasab with no3 as sole substrate decrement were dropped in r1 the reasons for the differences in n related genes will be discussed in depth within the network of genes and microbes 3 5 network analysis and microbial taxa functional genes associations as shown in fig 5 co occurrence networks of n metabolic functional genes n mfgs and microbes for r0 and r1 were constructed fig 5 the nodes and edge numbers of co occurrence networks in r1 142 and 614 was higher than r0 139 and 597 it has been proposed that complex microbial composition may form a more complex co occurrence network 31 for example the input of immobilized coal ash caused more complicated microbial composition and then offered richer sources of amocab fig 5 each network s modularity value was 0 426 0 513 and 0 530 in r0 and r1 respectively indicating that these two networks possessed module structure and exhibited high resistance to environmental changes 32 extremely similar microbes in r0 and r1 illustrated that the microorganisms in the aao process did not demonstrate environmental specificity but rather extensive coverage of n mfgs notably each co occurrence network displayed distinguishable characteristics these unique nodes increased the network s complexity and their involvement in the co occurrence network between two systems is primarily distributed to ammonia and nitrite oxidation processes for r0 three genera nitrosomonas nitrospira and hydrogenophaga were related to amocab whereas other two genera methylocystis and nitrosospira enriched the origins of amocab in r1 the potential hosts of narg in r0 and r1 shared 43 genera while other 4 and 7 genera were exclusive highly connected networks provide a more abundant source of n mfgs and have greater functional stability indicating that adding immobilized coal ash is more likely to guarantee the process nitrification during the process in terms of composition of the edges inoculation and non inoculation showed similar characteristics the relative proportion of microorganisms norb links was the largest ranging from 9 6 to 10 19 in two systems followed by microorganisms nasa remarkably the majority of correlations between n mfgs and microbes were positive ranging from 79 8 to 84 42 in r0 and r1 it means that bio augmentation not only increased the network s complexity but also decreased microbial competition these positive interactions are thought to include many microbes related to nitrogen removal such as nitrospira rhodobacter and comamonas 33 an increase in network complexity as well as a decrease in microbial competition were probably responsible to the promotion of nitrogen removal performance additionally although microorganisms nirb and microorganisms nird links only accounted for 1 79 2 16 of all links their proportion of negative correlations ranging from 30 78 to 46 15 was the highest the majority of unfavorable connections were thought to be caused by incompatible niches or by direct food rivalries 34 3 6 effects of operating factors on microbial community composition the rda diagram demonstrates the relative effects of changing do r and r conditions on the abundance of microbial communities involved in n metabolism at the family level in the bioaugmented aao fig 6 the results indicated that the interpretation weights for the first and second axes in the operational factor group were 51 59 and 0 67 respectively revealing that the aforementioned 3 condition changes could explain 52 26 of observed variations in bacterial community composition the most weighted factor influencing the composition of microbial communities was operating factor r followed in order by do and r there was a strong positive correlation between r and the nitrifying bacteria nitrosomonadaceae implying that the greater the returen of sludge the greater the number of nitrifying bacteria sludge reflux extended the sludge retention time in system thereby promoting the growth of autotrophic nitrifying bacteria furthermore r demonstrated a 100 positive effect on denitrifying bacteria do was positively correlated with comamonadaceae and negatively correlated with nitrosomonadaceae indicating that expanding do would eliminate autotrophic nitrifying bacteria in addition a clear separation existed in the various operating factors on the first and second axes revealing that when the same operating factor was altered there was a similarity in the microbial community composition 4 conclusions bio augmentation with immobilized coal ash improved the nh4 n and tin removal efficiencies of aao system through altering the microbial community structure and increasing the abundance of microbes related to n removal such as aob and nob furthermore bio augmentation enhanced the activity of key n transformation enzymes particularly amoabc and hao the bioaugmented aao system has a more intricate co occurrence network and richer origins of n mfgs return sludge flow has a positive impact on autotrophic nitrifying bacteria and denitrifying bacteria in the bioaugmented aao system according to the interactive effects of operating factors on microbes declaration of

detected in r0 and r1 respectively among which 197 were shared by both fig 3a the mean coverage indices of these two aao systems were both 0 99 indicating an adequate coverage of the sample library chao1 and shannon indices in r1 was higher than those in r0 indicating bio augmentation slightly increased the microbial diversity phylum specific microbial communities are depicted in fig 3b the dominant phyla in both reactors were proteobacteria bacteroidetes and firmicutes accounting for over 85 while a notable decrease of proteobacteria in r1 and an increase of bacteroidetes planctomycetes firmicutes etc were observed implying that proteobacteria could be inhibited and others could be enriched by bio augmentation this microbial evolution could be responsible for r1 s excellent n removal performance fig 3c depicts the composition of microbial community at genus level nitrosomonas and nirospira classified into others in both systems were the most abundant autotrophic ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob in both systems with their increasing by 161 11 and 116 67 in r1 respectively in contrast the majority of widely reported heterotrophic nitrifying bacteria including rhodobacter r0 4 55 r1 2 67 comamonas r0 7 83 r1 3 03 acinetobacter r0 4 09 r1 3 57 decreased in abundance 18 20 autotrophic nitrifiers contributed to nh4 n removal in aao systems 2 and the change in direction of autotrophic and heterotrophic nitrifiers also confirmed this in present study the increase in autotrophic aob and nob could be an explanation for promoted nh4 n removal efficiency in r1 oxic zone furthermore various denitrifiers were indentified in both reactors including hydrogenophaga r0 5 58 r1 6 15 thauera r0 3 08 r1 0 86 and pseudomonas r0 7 02 r1 3 81 21 23 which guaranteed nitrogen removal in the form of n2 or n2o ultimately azospira r0 2 67 r1 12 52 and exiguobacterium r0 5 36 r1 8 75 the most two abundant genera in r1 were also reported to possess denitrifying capability 24 25 to be specific the relative abundance of azospira and sediminibacterium raised dramatically from 2 67 and 1 63 in r0 to 12 52 and 8 17 in r1 respectively signaling a significant facilitation in the bioaugmented aao reactor sediminibacterium were thought to be associated with wastewater and sludge 26 moreover compared with r0 the relative abundant of autotrophic denitrifiers e g exiguobacterium in r1 was viewed as a characteristic closely related to bioaugmentation and the same correlation was observed for the estimated amount of heterotrophic denitrifiers e g azospira hydrogenophaga thauera pseudomonas the interaction between native and inoculated organisms promoted the growth of the microbes unfortunately this has not previously been established 3 4 differences of n metabolic pathways n metabolism genes were investigated including nitrification denitrification assimilatory n fixation and dissimilatory nitrate reduction fig 4 the predominance of autotrophic nitrifying bacteria enhanced nitrogen transformation in r1 the relative abundances of ammonium amoabc and hydroxylamine hao transporter genes in r1 were 1 83 8 22 times higher than their counterparts in r0 in the meantime additional nh4 n could be converted from assimilatory no2 n reduction nira indicating that microbes drove the complex n cycle in line with the enhanced ammonia n uptake the relative abundance of nitrite oxidoreductase nargh increased by 3 8 compared to r0 the upregulation of ammonia n metabolic genes was consistent with the growth advantages of aob and nob in r1 fig 3c the positive influences of bio augmentation on nitrifying bacteria and nitrification related genes were ascertained resulting in an increase in ammonia removal efficiency consistent with previous studies the genes encoding no3 n reductase napab and narghi had the highest relative abundance in relation to the denitrification process 27 only the nargh and nirk genes involving in the no3 and no2 transport exhibited slightly higher in r1 3 73 compared to r0 nonetheless nitrate reductase napab nari and nitric oxide reductase norbc in denitrification pathway in r1 were inferior to those in r0 the higher content of napab and narghi may be the potential driving force for the slight accumulation of no2 in r0 figs 1 and 2 again it was proved that the limited nitrogen loss in r0 was less likely due to the absence of genes related to denitrificaiton process in this study additionally the abundance of nitrous oxide reductase nosz was reinforced in r1 demonstrating that the bioaugmented aao system was prefer to achieve a lower n2o n2 ratio as the final products of denitrification process nitrifier ntrificaiton nitrifier denitrificaiton and heterotrophic denitrifcaiton are the three major pathways for n2o formation 28 while denitrification process reduces n2o formed into n2 under conducive conditions 29 suitable no3 concentration ph and carbon availability for example 30 in terms of dissimilatory assimilatory nitrate reduction except for nargh there was a distinct improvement for nrfa nirbd and nira in r1 what is noticeable was that each of those incremental genes utilized no2 as substrate conversely nari napab and nasab with no3 as sole substrate decrement were dropped in r1 the reasons for the differences in n related genes will be discussed in depth within the network of genes and microbes 3 5 network analysis and microbial taxa functional genes associations as shown in fig 5 co occurrence networks of n metabolic functional genes n mfgs and microbes for r0 and r1 were constructed fig 5 the nodes and edge numbers of co occurrence networks in r1 142 and 614 was higher than r0 139 and 597 it has been proposed that complex microbial composition may form a more complex co occurrence network 31 for example the input of immobilized coal ash caused more complicated microbial composition and then offered richer sources of amocab fig 5 each network s modularity value was 0 426 0 513 and 0 530 in r0 and r1 respectively indicating that these two networks possessed module structure and exhibited high resistance to environmental changes 32 extremely similar microbes in r0 and r1 illustrated that the microorganisms in the aao process did not demonstrate environmental specificity but rather extensive coverage of n mfgs notably each co occurrence network displayed distinguishable characteristics these unique nodes increased the network s complexity and their involvement in the co occurrence network between two systems is primarily distributed to ammonia and nitrite oxidation processes for r0 three genera nitrosomonas nitrospira and hydrogenophaga were related to amocab whereas other two genera methylocystis and nitrosospira enriched the origins of amocab in r1 the potential hosts of narg in r0 and r1 shared 43 genera while other 4 and 7 genera were exclusive highly connected networks provide a more abundant source of n mfgs and have greater functional stability indicating that adding immobilized coal ash is more likely to guarantee the process nitrification during the process in terms of composition of the edges inoculation and non inoculation showed similar characteristics the relative proportion of microorganisms norb links was the largest ranging from 9 6 to 10 19 in two systems followed by microorganisms nasa remarkably the majority of correlations between n mfgs and microbes were positive ranging from 79 8 to 84 42 in r0 and r1 it means that bio augmentation not only increased the network s complexity but also decreased microbial competition these positive interactions are thought to include many microbes related to nitrogen removal such as nitrospira rhodobacter and comamonas 33 an increase in network complexity as well as a decrease in microbial competition were probably responsible to the promotion of nitrogen removal performance additionally although microorganisms nirb and microorganisms nird links only accounted for 1 79 2 16 of all links their proportion of negative correlations ranging from 30 78 to 46 15 was the highest the majority of unfavorable connections were thought to be caused by incompatible niches or by direct food rivalries 34 3 6 effects of operating factors on microbial community composition the rda diagram demonstrates the relative effects of changing do r and r conditions on the abundance of microbial communities involved in n metabolism at the family level in the bioaugmented aao fig 6 the results indicated that the interpretation weights for the first and second axes in the operational factor group were 51 59 and 0 67 respectively revealing that the aforementioned 3 condition changes could explain 52 26 of observed variations in bacterial community composition the most weighted factor influencing the composition of microbial communities was operating factor r followed in order by do and r there was a strong positive correlation between r and the nitrifying bacteria nitrosomonadaceae implying that the greater the returen of sludge the greater the number of nitrifying bacteria sludge reflux extended the sludge retention time in system thereby promoting the growth of autotrophic nitrifying bacteria furthermore r demonstrated a 100 positive effect on denitrifying bacteria do was positively correlated with comamonadaceae and negatively correlated with nitrosomonadaceae indicating that expanding do would eliminate autotrophic nitrifying bacteria in addition a clear separation existed in the various operating factors on the first and second axes revealing that when the same operating factor was altered there was a similarity in the microbial community composition 4 conclusions bio augmentation with immobilized coal ash improved the nh4 n and tin removal efficiencies of aao system through altering the microbial community structure and increasing the abundance of microbes related to n removal such as aob and nob furthermore bio augmentation enhanced the activity of key n transformation enzymes particularly amoabc and hao the bioaugmented aao system has a more intricate co occurrence network and richer origins of n mfgs return sludge flow has a positive impact on autotrophic nitrifying bacteria and denitrifying bacteria in the bioaugmented aao system according to the interactive effects of operating factors on microbes declaration of
