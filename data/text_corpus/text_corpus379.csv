1895,there is an immediate need to develop accurate and reliable global hydrological forecasts in light of the future vulnerability to hydrological hazards and water scarcity under a changing climate as a part of the world meteorological organization s wmo global hydrological status and outlook system hydrosos initiative we investigated different approaches to blending multi model simulations for developing holistic operational global forecasts the ulysses multi model hydrological seasonal predictions system dataset to be published as global seasonal forecasts and reforecasts of river discharge and related hydrological variables ensemble from four state of the art land surface and hydrological models is used in this study the first step for improving these forecasts is to investigate ways to improve the model simulations as global models are not calibrated for local conditions the analysis was performed over 119 different catchments worldwide for the baseline period of 1981 2019 for three variables evapotranspiration surface soil moisture and streamflow this study evaluated blending approaches with a performance metric based weighted averaging of the multi model simulations using the catchment s kling gupta efficiency kge for the variable to define the weight hydrological model simulations were also bias corrected to improve the multi model blending output weighted blending in conjunction with bias correction provided the best improvement in performance for the catchments investigated applying modelled weights during blending original simulations improved performance over ungauged catchments the results indicate that there is potential to successfully and easily implement the bias corrected weighted blending approach to improve operational forecasts globally this work can be used to improve water resources management and hydrological hazard mitigation especially in data sparse regions keywords global hydrological forecasts hydrological models ulysses hydrosos bias correction multi model blending data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction freshwater supply is fundamental to human existence however droughts can be devastating e g wilhite et al 2007 and floods very destructive e g bubeck et al 2017 considerable advances in rainfall predictions at daily to seasonal timescales in recent years do not always solve the problem of predicting floods e g kobold and su≈°elj 2005 and droughts e g ali et al 2018 due to propagating uncertainties associated with hydrology and land processes any land surface and hydrological model dynamical or empirical or data driven needs information about the properties of the geology vegetation soil types etc which may not be easily available over data sparse regions thus large scale global hydrology and land surface models have uncertainties associated with model parameters derived from global datasets of soil properties topography and vegetation cover sood and smakhtin 2015 despite this schellekens et al 2017 show that using the average of a suite of such models can perform as a reasonable proxy for a locally calibrated model in some circumstances this gives us hope that we could provide reasonable regional forecasts of hydrological conditions in data sparse regions the world meteorological organization s wmo global hydrological status and outlook system hydrosos initiative approved for implementation at wmo congress resolution 25 cg 18 aims to utilise global scale modelled products from multiple sources to provide current global hydrological status and sub seasonal to seasonal outlooks jenkins et al 2020 the hydrosos initiative builds on existing knowledge and data to deliver monthly global hydrological forecasts that combine model output with local national and regional scale data so that the final product is locally informed wmo 2021 this is achievable as new sources of observations and state of the art models are closing the knowledge gap in the understanding of the water cycle and its forecasting lahoz and de lannoy 2014 lavers et al 2020 multi model hydrological forecasts have been shown to provide reliable predictions for different regions velazquez et al 2011 wanders and wood 2016 as blending forecasts from multiple models has been successful regionally e g ajami et al 2006 it can be applied globally to provide holistic hydrological predictions however it is critical that any new hydrological forecast s blending is tested in a scientifically justifiable and operationally implementable way different multi model blending techniques have long been used to improve forecasts by leveraging the skill of certain models while excluding the errors in others e g shamseldin et al 1997 roy et al 2020 the simplest blending method uses an average of all model members which can include model simulation standardisation to remove forecast bias georgakakos et al 2004 ajami et al 2006 however the simple average blending does not exploit enhanced skill of certain models selectively which can be implemented using weighted averaging methods by assigning weights to the model members e g diks and vrugt 2010 weights can be estimated based on different methods e g multiple linear regression wanders and wood 2016 sub ensemble selection methods thober and samaniego 2014 thober et al 2015 constrained least squares technique ajami et al 2006 using machine learning methods zaherpour et al 2019 or bayesian model averaging methods darbandsari and coulibaly 2019 which reward the skillful models and penalise the less skillful ones arsenault et al 2015 however some of these methods can become computationally intensive and time consuming when applied at a global scale neuman 2003 jozaghi et al 2021 wang et al 2023 studies can also assign weights to the models directly based on their skill metrics such as in arsenault et al 2015 which can be less computationally intensive methods but may not be optimal over ungauged basins arsenault and brissette 2016 further although weighted averaging outperforms individual models most of the time e g abrahart and see 2002 duan et al 2007 sometimes the best performing individual model performs better e g arsenault and brissette 2016 thus studies have shown that it is imperative to rigorously investigate any new modelling system s post processed output performance for generalised global applications duan et al 2007 our ultimate goal is to develop a methodology to improve global hydrological predictions which can be best achieved by using global multi model forecast products such forecast products can help us deliver holistic i e forecasts for different variables over the same catchments and skillful predictions while sending a simplified message to the users through multi model blending roy et al 2020 given the global nature of our end product it is essential that the blending method used should be computationally non intensive while being sophisticated enough to exploit the skill of models considering the computational cost has a three fold objective the economic cost time efficiency and carbon footprint all are especially important if these methods are to be applied in an operational set up the latter carbon footprint of intensive computational science is a growing concern in the scientific community in an era where international efforts are focused in achieving net zero as the energy needed to power intensive computing is the main source of green house gas emissions from scientific activities eichhorn et al 2022 lannelongue and inouye 2023 since the model blending is a post processing step of an already computationally expensive product ensemble of global distributed hydrological simulations it is paramount that the additional carbon footprint of this step is kept as minimal as possible while still providing added value to the end product further bias correcting the simulations using simple methods before blending the multi model output has shown to significantly improve performance for the forecasts e g dion et al 2021 thus in this study we analyse the possibility of using the performance metric of the model as a weight for blending a global multi model output in a simple and computationally inexpensive way tested using the baseline simulations and also investigate the improvements by bias correcting the simulations before blending we test our blending methods on ungauged catchments by modelling the performance of the models over catchments without observations for three different hydrological variables streamflow soil moisture and evaporation we compare our blending method which uses model performance metrics as weights against the arithmetic averaging method which was used as the benchmark these methods investigated in the study provide a promising future for global water resource management and flood forecasting especially over data sparse regions the article is organised as follows section 2 introduces the data the methods used are provided in section 3 the results are described in section 4 the recommendations from our results section 5 1 limitations of our study section 5 2 and future avenues of research section 5 3 are discussed in section 5 and summary and conclusions are given in section 6 2 data for this study we used 119 sample catchments across the world fig 1 all of the study catchments have global runoff data centre grdc bfg 2020 daily streamflow data available along with catchment characteristics table s1 we wanted to evaluate the performance of more than 100 basins with extensive spatial coverage across the world and large hydroclimatic heterogeneity to be able to investigate the performance of ulysses forecasts across the globe for different types of catchments thus the 119 catchments were chosen on the following criteria i catchments are larger than 5000 km2 ii distributed in most hydroclimatic zones based on the budyko analysis iii manual quality check of observations did not reveal significant errors abrupt changes or constant values iv at least 5 years of grdc observed data were available on record between 1981 2019 v subjective selection of catchments to be spread across the globe samaniego et al 2020 setting a larger threshold for observation years for catchment selection would have led to fewer catchments available over africa asia and south america our selection criteria left us with 7 catchments in africa 16 in asia 34 in south america 35 in northern america 10 in australia and 17 in europe fig 1 we used output from the ulysses contract multi model hydrological seasonal predictions system samaniego et al 2020 ufz 2020 in this study which will be available at copernicus climate change service c3s as global seasonal forecasts and reforecasts of river discharge and related hydrological variables ensemble from four state of the art land surface and hydrological models for brevity we refer to this dataset as ulysses dataset the four land surface and hydrological models are mesoscale hydrologic model mhm samaniego et al 2010 kumar et al 2013 is a spatially explicit distributed hydrological model developed by helmholtz centre for environmental research pcr globwb pgb sutanudjaja et al 2018 is a grid based global hydrology and water resources model developed at utrecht university hydrology tiled ecmwf scheme for surface exchanges over land htessel johnson et al 2019 is the land surface model of the coupled european centre for medium range weather forecasts system 5 seasonal forecasting model joint uk land environment simulator jules best et al 2011 clark et al 2011 is a land surface model developed by a wide community of researchers coordinated by the uk met office and uk centre for ecology and hydrology it is used both as a standalone model and as the land surface component in the met office unified model ulysses uses the four hydrological models to output multiple hydrological variables as gridded output e g runoff evapotranspiration soil moisture samaniego et al 2020 the streamflow output of different rivers for all four models is derived through the multiscale routing model mrm thober et al 2019 in this study we evaluate blending of three output variables evapotranspiration et surface soil moisture sm and streamflow sf for the modelled baseline period of 1981 2019 we use monthly mean values for the three variables extracted for the 119 catchments sf is extracted at the catchment outflow point on the river network for each of the 119 catchments to compare against the observations figure s1 et and sm are extracted as area averaged values for the same 119 catchments from gridded output figures s2 s3 we derive the catchment extent from the digital elevation information from global multi resolution terrain elevation data 2010 gmted2010 danielson and gesch 2011 for each catchment we validate our blended output against observations for the three variables for et we use global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam version 3 5a actual evaporation data figure s2a martens et al 2017 for sm we use the european space agency esa climate change initiative cci volumetric soil moisture product version 02 2 figure s3a liu et al 2011 dorigo et al 2017 for sf we use grdc observed sf from the global runoff data centre d 56002 koblenz germany figure s1 grdc wmo 2021 using these observations leads to some missing observations for sf figure s1 and some catchments having no observed data for sm figure s3a implications of which is discussed in section 5 2 however we evaluate all the three variables for the same 119 catchments as we would like to analyse if the ulysses output can provide skillful yet holistic hydrological forecasts over different regions of the world further as we are evaluating the performance of the models at catchment scale we need to have observations representing the whole catchment which are usually generated through remote sensing or modelling network of in situ observations for et and sm rather than using station or point observations which may not be able to represent intra catchment variability thus this method of analysis allows us to investigate if ulysses can provide hydrologically consistent global forecasts 3 methodology to provide a skillful blended hydrological products using the ulysses simulations we evaluate different blended approaches applied on native original and bias corrected model variables at a monthly time step for all the 119 catchments for the baseline period 1981 2019 we also evaluate the application of our methods on daily vs monthly sf values we further investigate the application of blending approaches on ungauged stations fig 2 summarises the methods used in this study as a flow chart the following subsections describe these approaches in detail 3 1 blending approaches we use the following two blending approaches to generate blended output for native and bias corrected simulations 1 arithmetic average the simplest form of blending multi model output is an average of the four model variables without any weighting as used in shamseldin et al 1997 arsenault et al 2015 and will be referred to as the arithmetic blending approach fig 3 shows an example of the observed and native simulated variables along with the arithmetic blended versions which is referred to as native arithmetic output we also blend the bias corrected variables discussed in section 3 2 and the blended output is referred to as bias corrected arithmetic output figs 2 3 the performance of the arithmetic blended output is used as a benchmark to compare other blending approaches in this study 2 weighted average the weighted average method uses weights based on model performance and from here on is referred to as weighted blending approach model performance at each catchment was assessed for monthly mean variables et sm sf from all four models over the baseline period using the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 the kge metric evaluates the model performance for contribution of mean variance and correlation see section 3 4 for more detail for this approach the kge metric for each model and variable is identified as their respective weights and the blended output is calculated using weighted averaging native weighted and bias corrected weighted please note that each catchment has its own set of weights here we apply weighted arithmetic mean in which sum of the catchment values multiplied with their respective weights is divided by the sum of weights we only use positive kge values as weights for any model with a negative kge metric the weight is set to zero and thus ignored for any catchment and variable with all models showing negative kge metric we use arithmetic blending approach instead i e all model weights are set to one this only occurs for 25 catchments for sm 1 catchment for sf and no catchments for et for native simulations and only 8 catchments for sm bias corrected simulations fig 3 shows examples of the native and bias corrected variables for each model along with their weighted blended counterparts referred to as native weighted and bias corrected weighted output fig 2 we also test another version of the original weighted blending approach in which we use the kge metric calculated for sf and apply it to the et and sm simulations we will refer to this method as sf weighted blending native sf weighted and bias corrected sf weighted outputs for et and sm this approach is intended to derive blended hydrological products that still maintain the catchment hydrological balance which for some applications can be more important than getting the best possible estimate for all three variables 3 2 bias correction the bias correction methodology tested here is based on farmer et al 2018 and is applied by sanchez lozano et al 2021 to operationally bias correct geo global water sustainability geoglows sf forecasts although farmer et al 2018 recommend 14 complete years of observed data to be able to accurately calculate the percentiles the method is applied here to all stations regardless of the length of record shortest record is of 5 years however the median length observations is 29 years over all study catchments compared to the full period of 39 years between 1981 2019 and out of 119 catchments 98 have more than 14 years of observations please note we have not performed bias correction for sm over catchments with fully missing data for bias correction of sf model output we first calculate a flow duration curve fdc for all data for daily data this is done for each month separately in observed and simulated time series fig 4 shows an example of the fdcs for an example catchment for the model htessel using the fdcs the non exceedance probability of every simulated value can be estimated the observed sf value corresponding to that non exceedance probability can be deduced the simulated value is then converted by replacing it with the equivalent observed sf to the same non exceedance probability i e quantile mapping method this will be referred to as the bias corrected sf kge metrics are calculated for all the bias corrected sf simulations from the four models and arithmetic and weighted blending approaches are applied to get bias corrected arithmetic and bias corrected weighted blended sf time series for bias correction of et and sm the same approach is applied replacing sf in the fdc by the variable in question please note that for the daily sf bias correction was performed for each month separately whereas for the monthly data sf et and sm the time series was not split into months as the records were not long enough 3 3 modelling kge weights at ungauged basins to apply the weighted average blending technique section 3 1 at ungauged basins the kge metric needs to be modelled which can then be used as weights for each model at the ungauged basins for blending in this study we refer to the ungauged basins where the observed data is hidden for testing the method over regions with no observations this method is only tested for sf as other hydrological variables et and sm have observations from remote measurements available all over the globe in the form of gridded data and thus do not have ungauged catchments catchment characteristics extracted for all 119 study catchments from the hydroatlas dataset linke et al 2019 were used to build the kge statistical model kge stats model to estimate sf kge at ungauged catchments using statistical approaches from the full list of 56 catchments attributes available in hydroatlas 17 attributes most relevant to hydrology and land surface modelling were retained table 1 for a full description of the variables please see the hydroatlas riveratlas catalogue lehner 2019 the number of variables were then further reduced by analysing the cross correlation between the catchment attributes and the hydrological models performance kge metric cross correlation between the 17 variables allows for the identification of a subset of 9 variables with high correlations for the modelling of kge at ungauged catchments we tested different machine learning methods multiple linear regression polynomial regression support vector regression decision tree regression random forest regression and xgboost regression for each of these six methods we conducted two combinations of experiments i with all 17 variables and with a subset of 9 variables selected after cross correlation analysis as input predictors ii with principal component analysis pca to reduce dimensionality and without pca in addition to the regression methods an artificial neural network ann with one hidden layer was also built the ann was tested with a range of different number of neurons in the hidden layer different batch sizes and number of epochs all the regression and ann models were built separately for each of the four hydrological models and assessed individually to identify the best kge stats model this means that each hydrological model has a different statistical model to estimate kge therefore the best kge stats model for htessel is not necessarily the same as the one for jules for example to assess the performance of each kge stats model their r2 score coefficient of determination was compared using the leave one out cross validation loocv method sammut and webb 2010 loocv consists of leaving one observation out from the dataset to build the model and using the observation left out to assess the model this process is repeated for every observation available in the dataset where each time a different observation is left out the best kge stats model based on this assessment was selected for each of the four hydrological models and were used to produce a set of estimated kge metric for all four models at all 119 case study catchments we expand on the modelling of kge metrics in section 4 3 the blended output is calculated after applying the new modelled kge metrics as weights to the native sf simulations referred to as native modelled weighted this modelled weighted blending approach identifies how well the weighted blended approach for sf performs over ungauged stations kge of the resulting modelled weighted blended product is calculated to quantify and compare its performance with the original weighted approach 3 4 validation using the methods described in section 3 1 3 3 we develop different blended products fig 2 for the three variables et sm sf over the baseline period 1981 2019 for the 119 catchments 1 native arithmetic blended output 2 native weighted blended output along with native sf weighted blended output for et and sm 3 native modelled weighted blended output only for native sf simulations 4 bias corrected arithmetic blended output 5 bias corrected weighted blended output along withbias corrected sf weighted blended output for et and sm the respective observed datasets are used to validate the native and bias corrected model simulations and the blended outputs validation can only be carried out for the period over which the observed data is available and thus model simulations and blended output for sm and sf are masked over the period where the corresponding observed data is missing please note that some catchments are missing for sm due to missing observations for the whole study period see figure s3a section 2 we verify the bias mean and variance of the model simulations and blended output using the kge and nash sutcliffeefficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 metrics calculated at monthly time step 1 k g e 1 r 1 2 œÉ s i m œÉ o b s 1 2 Œº s i m Œº o b s 1 2 where r is the linear correlation coefficient between observations and model simulations œÉ s i m and œÉ o b s are standard deviations of the simulations and observations respectively and Œº s i m and Œº o b s are means of the simulations and observations respectively kge equal to 1 indicates a perfect agreement between the simulations and observed kge less than 0 indicates poor model performance gupta et al 2009 2 n s e 1 t 1 t t v s i m t v o b s t 2 t 1 t t v o b s t Œº o b s 2 where t is the total number of time steps v s i m t is the model simulation at time t v o b s t is the observations at time t and Œº o b s is the mean observed variable nse equal to 1 indicates perfect correspondence between model and observations nse equal to 0 indicates that the model simulations have similar performance as the mean of the observations and nse less than 0 indicates model simulation is worse than the observed mean the kge metric is one of the most commonly used metric to evaluate model performance in the field of hydrology knoben et al 2019 and has been extensively used for model calibration and evaluation e g siqueira et al 2018 sutanudjaja et al 2018 for clarity we would like to draw the reader s attention to the different uses made of the kge metric throughout this study kge was used to define the weights assigned to each of the four models for the weighted blending approach the kge metric is used instead of nse metric because kge improves upon some of the drawbacks of nse associated with underestimating runoff variability by better representing the constitutive components correlation variability bias and mean bias gupta et al 2009 for native and bias corrected simulations respective kge values have been calculated for each catchment and each model as each variable will have its own set of weights the water balance of the blended product will not be maintained therefore as a separate experiment kge calculated for sf is also applied to et and sm sf weighted blending so that the same set of weights is used for all variables which maintains catchment water balance within each model kge for sf was also modelled using statistical approaches to be used as weights for the native simulations to produce the modelled weighted blending to be tested for ungauged catchments kge was used as one of the validation metrics to compare the performance of the different individual models and blending approaches for each variable et sm and sf and for native and bias corrected simulations this study also compares the baseline model simulations and blended output as categorical forecasts divided into 5 categories low 0 10 below normal 10 33 normal 33 67 above normal 67 90 and high 90 100 these categories can be combined to consider the outputs simply as equal terciles but the five categories provide the likelihood of more extreme events better the categorical verification of simulation allows for the evaluation of forecast skill for specific categories rather than for models identifying the exact value of the variable simulated bias corrected and blended outputs categorical skill is measured using accuracy acc wilks 2011 and heidke skill score hss heidke 1926 these skill scores represent absolute categorical skill acc of the output and skill relative to that of a random chance hss 3 a c c 1 n i 1 c n s i o i where n is the total number of simulations c is the number of categories 5 for this study and n s i o i are the number of times that the model simulates correctly for the category i acc measures how many times the model hits the correct category but it can be influenced by the most common category acc has range of 0 to 1 with 1 for a perfect simulation 4 h s s 1 n i 1 c n s i o i 1 n 2 i 1 c n s i n o i 1 1 n 2 i 1 c n s i n o i where n is the total number of simulations c is the number of categories 5 for this study n s i o i are the number of times the model simulates correctly for the category and n s i n o i is the product of the number of simulations and observed for a particular category i hss measures only the correct model simulations which occur beyond that of a random chance hss ranges from to 1 1 is the perfect score and anything less than 0 shows that correct simulations are due to random chance 4 results 4 1 arithmetic and weighted blending for each catchment arithmetic average and weighted average blended output is calculated from all four model native and bias corrected simulations for all three variables section 3 1 fig 3a c shows an example catchment native model time series for all four models for the three variables and the native blended model outputs for 1993 for the sao paulo de olivenca river catchment all models underestimate et fig 3a overestimate sm fig 3b and have their phase shifted for peak sf fig 3c native pgb simulations perform best over this catchment blending native simulations reduces the errors but the weighted blending only shows improvement over arithmetic blending for sm in this catchment we note that different catchments and different years have very different errors and improvements with blending and bias correction not shown thus we summarise our results using kge metric figure s4 fig 5 comparison between the native simulations and weighted blended sf shows that the blended product out performs the individual models for 75 of the catchments figure s4c fig 5c but there is only moderate improvement for et and sm figure s4a b fig 5a b the native arithmetic blended has lower performance than the native weighted blended output for all three variables fig 5 for et and sf mhm native simulations have similar performance to the native arithmetic blended output mhm may be performing better as it uses multiscale parameter regionalisation mpr technique which can parameterise across basins and scales using nonlinear transfer functions and is shown to perform better than standard regionalisation samaniego et al 2010 sm has the largest spread in kge metric compared to et and sf despite lower number of catchments verified figure s4b section 2 for sm 15 catchments figure s4b have no observations for the whole baseline period figure s3a for all four models kge metric for sm is in general lower than for the other two variables suggesting that sm is particularly challenging to estimate from global models or from satellite sensors for observations please see section 5 2 for more detailed discussion the same arithmetic and weighted blending methods are also used to blend the bias corrected simulations using the kge metric from the bias corrected simulations fig 3d f modelled kge metric is used for weighted averaging of native simulations to evaluate performance of the method over ungauged catchments for sf these two points will be discussed in the subsequent subsections 4 2 bias correction of variables each model simulation is bias corrected using the method described in section 3 2 as the ulysses global product cannot be calibrated to every location the bias correction further aligns the estimated streamflow to local conditions and thus provides an added value for users applying the forecasts at local scale the new kge metric from the bias corrected model simulations is used as weights for blending the bias corrected model simulations to calculate the bias corrected weighted blended output bias corrected simulations are also simply averaged to get the bias corrected arithmetic blended product fig 3d f shows an example of bias corrected and blended output bias correction fig 3d e improves the native et and sm simulations fig 3a b for sf bias correction fig 3f improves the magnitude but does not correct the timing i e the phase shift seen in the native sf simulations fig 3c as expected the bias corrected simulations for individual models outperform the native simulations for all three variables figure s4 showing that bias correction improves model performance other studies also show the importance of bias correction of hydrological forecasts to improve prediction skill e g zalachori et al 2012 the improvement is smaller with et where the native simulations already perform well fig 5a but the improvement is larger for sm and sf fig 5b c bias correction almost always improves the performance of any model output as shown for the sf simulations in fig 6 the bias corrected arithmetic or weighted blended output outperforms native arithmetic or weighted blended output for almost all the catchments for the three variables figure s4 fig 5 it should be noted that this bias correction method for sf can only be performed over gauged catchments which have observed data available bias correction of ungauged catchments is beyond the scope of this study but bias correcting simulations before producing a blended product is important for any operational implementation 4 3 kge estimation at ungauged stations at ungauged catchments where observed data is not available to calculate performance metrics kge weights for sf need to be estimated in order to implement the weighted blending approach we model sf kge using the method described in section 3 3 cross correlation analysis between the different catchment characteristics fig 7a and correlation of each of the catchment characteristics table 1 with the kge of each of the four hydrological model variables fig 7b shows that some characteristics are highly correlated amongst themselves where two catchment characteristics were highly correlated the one that was most correlated to the kge of the hydrological models was retained thus we select a subset of 9 catchment characteristics discharge lake area slope precip pet snow forest and soil water content see table 1 for the list of full names of catchment characteristics from fig 7b we can observe that in general the correlations between the models kge and the various catchment characteristics are weak one notable exception is the high correlation observed between jules kge and soil water content positive correlation and pasture cover negative correlation these two catchment characteristics are highly correlated between them negatively this observation indicates that jules struggles to simulate river flows for catchments where pastures are the dominating land cover all models performances are negatively correlated with the degree of regulation pgb s performance increases with snow cover extent which suggests the snow module of this model is more efficient than the other models with the exception of htessel models are generally worse at predicting flow in regions with high evaporative demand pet htessel is worse than the other models at simulating flows where lakes are present from the different kge stats models tested section 3 3 the best performing model was selected based on the r2 score coefficient of determination for each of the four hydrological models table 2 pca did not improve the r2 score for any of the kge stats model tested and the ann model did not outperform the best regression model in any of the cases the sample size is believed to be too small to effectively train an ann model note that the r2 score even with the best of the kge stat models is relatively low especially for mhm which means that kge is difficult to predict accurately from catchment characteristics alone using the kge stats model shown in table 2 the modelled kge metric for each of the 119 study catchments for all four hydrological models was derived fig 6 for example the support vector regression method is applied to estimate kge values which we called the modelled kge of the pgb model for all catchments as if the real kge values for these catchments cannot be calculated due to the observations being unavailable one modelled kge value is derived for each catchment and each hydrological model these modelled kge values are then used for the weighted averaging of the four model simulations to derive the native modelled weighted blended output section 3 3 over most catchments the modelled kge closely matches the native kge for all four models except for catchments with very low kge values red dots in fig 6 the statistical models estimate improved kge in such catchments which is not an accurate representation of hydrological model performance and thus not useful for blending methods over ungauged catchments the errors in modelled kge metric over such catchments may stem from failure in dynamically modelling such catchments e g very dry basins are challenging to model and thus it may be beyond the capability of these statistical models to estimate the kge metric based on catchment characteristics alone further in depth research may be required to develop these methods further these new modelled kge metrics were used as weights for the native sf simulations to derive the modelled weighted blended product see section 3 3 3 4 the modelled weighted blended product has similar performance as native weighted blended output over catchments where the kge stats model estimates the kge metric well as expected and different poorer or better in some cases performance over catchments where the kge stats model estimates the kge metric poorly not shown modelled weighted simulations outperforms arithmetic blended in most cases but not as much as weighted blending using observed kge weights fig 8a 4 4 validation from the methods discussed in above three subsections a combination of blended products are derived native arithmetic average native weighted average also alternatively native sf weighted average for et and sm modelled weighted average only for sf bias corrected arithmetic average and bias corrected weighted average also alternatively bias corrected sf weighted average for et and sm fig 5 shows that blending of any type improves kge achieved compared with the native simulations from the four individual models except for sm arithmetic blending as discussed before bias correction improves individual model simulation fig 6 although the degree of improvement is catchment and model specific figure s4 blending bias corrected simulations shows the highest improvement compared to all the other approaches for example only 6 out of the 119 catchments show poorer performance for the bias corrected weighted blended sf compared to the native weighted blended sf figure s4 the comparison between bias corrected weighted blended product and bias corrected arithmetic blended product shows improvement for all three variables albeit only marginal except for sm figs 5 8a c for sm the bias corrected weighted blending performs much better than bias corrected arithmetic blending especially for stations where the catchments have a negative kge for native simulations not shown further for the blending of the native simulations performance of the blended output is improved by the use of kge weights figs 5 8b thus weighted blending is useful with both native and bias corrected simulations as mentioned in section 3 1 we also test the original weighted blending method against the sf weighted for et and sm and we show the differences of these two weighted blending approaches against arithmetic blending of native and bias corrected simulations in fig 8b c for both native and bias corrected simulations weighted blended outperforms the sf weighted blended for both et and sm in fact the sf weighted blending mostly performs similarly or slightly worse than the arithmetic blending the performance difference is larger in sm than in et fig 8b c as the kge spread in sm simulations is larger fig 5b we also test the weighted blending approaches over ungauged stations for sf by modelling kge using catchment characteristics modelled weighted blending section 4 3 for the native simulations modelled weighted performs slightly worse than weighted blending but is still overall better than arithmetic blending fig 8a thus overall the kge stats model was capable of estimating the sf kge for ungauged catchments to a certain degree but as mentioned in section 3 3 kge is not solely attributable to catchment characteristics please note that we have not compared weighted and modelled weighted blending for bias corrected sf simulations fig 8a as this was beyond the scope of this study the performance of models native and blended simulations is also measured with another performance metric nse fig 5d f performance with nse shows similar results to performance with kge blended products show higher performance compared to individual models except for mhm in et and sf bias correction improves model performance more in sm and sf than et and kge based weights improve performance more when applied to native simulations than bias corrected simulations we also compare the application of our methods on daily vs monthly sf simulations using kge and nse performance metrics figure s5 applying our methods to daily simulations shows similar improvement in performance as compared to methods applied to monthly simulations and the overall conclusions for blending and bias correction methods performance remain the same categorical forecast skill calculated for five categories see section 3 4 is measured using acc and hss skill scores compared to the performance metrics kge and nse using skill scores acc and hss show smaller improvements after blending fig 9 hss for et and sf are positive which indicates that the accuracy of getting each category right is better than that from a random chance fig 9d f but sm has some negative hss values fig 9e there is no improvement in performance with bias correction which is to be expected as the bias correction will not modify the relative values of the variables there is improvement in the native arithmetic and weighted blended products as compared to individual models in sf but this improvement is not very large in et and sm pgb performs the worst amongst the individual models with both skill scores for the native sf simulations mhm outperforms the other models for sf and has similar skill to the blended products fig 9c f this may be due to the fact that mhm uses the mpr technique to parameterise across basins and scales see section 4 1 further it should be noted that there are large gaps in the observed data for some stations with sf section 2 which shortens the length of the time period of evaluation and may lead to poorer categorical skill for sf with blended products for certain stations 5 discussion in this study we aimed to identify simple blending approaches and thus their feasibility for implementation in operational forecasts however this is a pilot study and has only been conducted for baseline simulations for just three variables and 119 catchments thus more future work is required before implementation of these methods operationally in this section we discuss the practical implications of our study that need to be carefully considered before implementation 5 1 recommendations our results show that arithmetic blending rarely improved performance over that of the best performing individual model which has also been shown by other studies e g mo and lettenmaier 2014 weighted blending adds value to native simulations but bias correction leads to much higher improvement other studies have also found that bias correction of forecasts as a post processing method is very effective for multi model ensemble hydrological forecasts e g dion et al 2021 bohn et al 2010 also show that individual best bias corrected model outperforms the multi model arithmetic average and blending after bias correction only marginally improves forecast performance over individual bias corrected models thus bias correction is recommended wherever possible when providing categorical forecasts bias correction is not necessary as the improvement in performance in bias corrected weighted blending is modest thus native weighted blended product can be used instead however multi model blending for categorical forecasts could still be beneficial in order to simplify the message to the end users where the application of bias correction is difficult e g ungauged catchments weighted blending using modelled kge is a good alternative and performs better than arithmetic averaging applications of the multi model merging improves the quality of forecasts by maintaining the ensemble dispersion with lead time e g thiboult et al 2016 xu et al 2019 and enhances the reliability of any forecasting system by incorporating the model uncertainty e g ahmed et al 2019 merging multi model streamflow forecasts using methods like bayesian model averaging leads to an improvement in skill e g duan et al 2007 luo and wood 2008 however these are approaches that have been investigated on the multi model probabilistic forecasts rather than baseline simulations as in this study probabilistic forecasts include hydrological model uncertainty as in baseline simulations but also have uncertainty related to the atmospheric ensemble forecasts used to drive the models e g krzysztofowicz 2001 as the skill of these forecasts vary in space and time the effect of the uncertainties from the atmospheric forcing on the hydrological forecasts could also vary with lead time and catchment characteristics at shorter lead times forecasts will be influenced more by the initial conditions whereas for longer lead times the climate forcing will have a stronger effect e g li et al 2009 for slow responding catchments the uncertainties in the climate forcing will have less importance than for flashy catchments e g sutanto and van lanen 2022 this means that the benefits of our blending and bias correction method found in this study for the baseline might not transfer directly or uniformly when applied to forecasts thus there is further need to investigate the uncertainty before implementing our method to probabilistic forecasts using consistent weights for all variables i e sf kge weighted blended product has poorer performance as compared to using kge from respective variables thus it is expected that we use the better performing blending approach i e the weighted blended product for operational forecasts using weights based on skill of the individual models to merge multi model ensemble simulations has been shown to reduce the bias in climate simulations thober and samaniego 2014 however weighting each variable with different kge weights provides us with forecasts without local hydrological balance and will not be suited for certain user requirements for applications where water balance closure is necessary e g drought forecasting systems predicting water availability in both rivers and soils blended product using sf weights gives an alternative to arithmetic averaging which optimises sf blended product with et and sm blended product similar or slightly worse than arithmetic blended product multi model blending at daily timesteps has similar performance to blending at monthly timesteps and we therefore recommend the use of simulations at either timestep as per the user requirement this result is different in snowmelt dominated catchments where the performance generally improves on aggregating the sf merged simulations from daily to monthly time scales e g bohn et al 2010 5 2 limitations our study is limited by the number of catchments evaluated and the missing data for the variables sm and sf although we attempt to make our results as robust as possible we could not ascertain the exact influence nested catchments have on the results uncertainty analysis performed using bootstrapping different sample sizes of catchments not shown suggests that our recommendations from section 5 1 remain valid even with a smaller sample catchments another limitation of our study is that we consider the validation data to be the truth but in reality it has its own errors the errors in sm observations play an important role in poor performance of sm simulations over the catchments studied e g rakovec et al 2016 the sm observations are derived from a remote sensing product that has some errors and the et observations are a blended observed modelled product however these validation datasets are the best estimate of observations available to us for such a global analysis investigating the performance of all three variables over the same catchment sample but we do recognise the observational uncertainty inherent in our methodology further many previous studies have used these same et and sm observations to calibrate hydrological models to improve sf forecasts e g l√≥pez l√≥pez et al 2017 demb√©l√© et al 2020 ding and zhu 2022 gleam et dataset performs well at a regional e g yang et al 2017 or global e g miralles et al 2011 scale when validated against in situ observations in different studies e g martens et al 2018 similarly studies have also shown that cci sm product performs well against in situ observations regionally e g gonz√°lez zamora et al 2019 and globally e g dorigo et al 2015 we ourselves have validated the cci sm product against international soil moisture network ismn stations using the qa4sm platform https qa4sm eu ui home using multiple metrics the results from mean squared error mse figure s6a unbiased root mean squared difference ubrmsd figure s6a and other metrics not shown clearly show that cci sm has high performance and skill when validated against observations these findings have given us confidence that we can use these datasets as proxy for observations to validate the ulysses model simulations especially over data sparse regions for sm an additional source of error stems from the fact that sm depth from models is different to the measurements from satellites as satellites only estimate moisture in the top few centimetres of soil whereas land surface models simulate moisture at greater depth some studies e g beale et al 2021 have investigated the possibility to correct for the mismatch in depth using soil moisture depth profile modelling when comparing soil moisture from different sources and have shown that this can account for large differences however these methods require a range of input parameters soil hydraulic properties vegetation cover and type etc which are not readily available for global studies such as ours therefore we have followed the approach taken in other studies e g peng et al 2021 schellekens et al 2017 and have directly compared the modelled sm with the sm observations although we do acknowledge that this may lead to some uncertainties and our calculated model performance may not reflect the true model performance 5 3 future work blended forecast products derived from the ulysses project are not limited to the three variables evaluated in this study thus there is a need to assess the skill of the blended products for the whole set of forecast variables e g runoff snow cover terrestrial water storage implementing our blending approaches over more catchments will provide better estimates of uncertainty further research may also evaluate blending approaches on a grid point level rather than just catchment level modelling kge for ungauged catchments sf have shown somewhat promising results however as noted in the results catchment characteristics do not completely represent the kge for ungauged catchments improved modelling of kge in future research can lead to improved weighted blending approaches multi model streamflow forecast show an improvement in skill upon merging the individual ensembles of all models e g duan et al 2007 luo and wood 2008 however the blending and bias correction approaches used in this study were tested on the model simulations from baseline period 1981 2019 which have a single simulated output per model as a next step ulysses data should be evaluated for all of its initialisations and the full ensemble of hindcasts and forecasts to assess its skill and ascertain the uncertainty of the forecasts at different lead times ulysses provides global hindcasts 1993 2019 and operational forecasts 2020 2021 for each model at monthly lead times with 6 months extent each all model forecasts have a five member ensemble for each initialisation except for february may august and november initialisations which have 25 members each for operational blended forecasts performance metrics for weighting derived from the hindcast period might yield forecasts with better skill however additional uncertainty coming from errors in atmospheric forecasts may mean that the improvements found in our research do not directly translate into improvements in hydrological forecasts thus further assessment on the hindcasts are needed further understanding of the performance using the hindcasts will allow identification of forecast and ensemble uncertainty skill for blended products should also be assessed for anomalies or categories of variables rather than just for absolute values to identify the best forecast product that can be provided to the users 6 summary and conclusions this study analyses different approaches for blending multi model simulations derived from the ulysses project focusing on computationally inexpensive methods in an effort to limit the carbon footprint and cost of this post processing step the verification of the blending methods has been performed for 119 sample catchments for the baseline period of 1981 2019 using et sm and sf variables the blending approach tested here is weighted averaging of the native multi model simulations using catchment performance metric kge for each variable as the weight the arithmetic multi model averaging method is used to identify the added value of the weighted blended approach the analysis also includes bias correction of model simulations before applying the two blending approaches further the blending approaches are also tested for sf over ungauged catchments by modelling the kge metric based on catchment characteristics we also apply sf kge weights for weighted blending of et and sm to have a hydrologically balanced forecast our results show that the weighted blending approach has added value over the arithmetic blending when applied to the native simulation over most catchments weighted blending also adds value when applied to the bias corrected simulations but the improvement seen is lower than with native simulations bias correction improves individual model simulations for all three variables absolute values but not the categorical forecasts results indicate that greater improvement is achieved through bias correction than through weighted blending from all the approaches tested the best performing method is the bias correction followed by weighted blending therefore bias correction of simulations before blending using weights is the recommended method unless only categorical forecasts are considered in which case native weighted blending is the recommended method modelling of kge for sf has proven to be a viable option to apply weighted blending at ungauged catchments applying consistent weights for blending across all the three variables based on sf kge metric for hydrologically consistent forecasts shows poorer performance than using variables respective weights however using consistent weights for blending for all variables is a possible option if the local water balance needs to be maintained the sf weighted blending shows similar performance to arithmetic blending for et slightly poorer for sm but shows vastly improved performance for sf thus this method might be the most suited for certain applications where the water balance closure is more important e g drought forecasting systems predicting water availability in both rivers and soils than the accuracy of each individual variable the findings of this study show promising results for the application of blending approaches along with bias correction for global hydrological forecasts more detailed investigations are required for application of this method for

1895,there is an immediate need to develop accurate and reliable global hydrological forecasts in light of the future vulnerability to hydrological hazards and water scarcity under a changing climate as a part of the world meteorological organization s wmo global hydrological status and outlook system hydrosos initiative we investigated different approaches to blending multi model simulations for developing holistic operational global forecasts the ulysses multi model hydrological seasonal predictions system dataset to be published as global seasonal forecasts and reforecasts of river discharge and related hydrological variables ensemble from four state of the art land surface and hydrological models is used in this study the first step for improving these forecasts is to investigate ways to improve the model simulations as global models are not calibrated for local conditions the analysis was performed over 119 different catchments worldwide for the baseline period of 1981 2019 for three variables evapotranspiration surface soil moisture and streamflow this study evaluated blending approaches with a performance metric based weighted averaging of the multi model simulations using the catchment s kling gupta efficiency kge for the variable to define the weight hydrological model simulations were also bias corrected to improve the multi model blending output weighted blending in conjunction with bias correction provided the best improvement in performance for the catchments investigated applying modelled weights during blending original simulations improved performance over ungauged catchments the results indicate that there is potential to successfully and easily implement the bias corrected weighted blending approach to improve operational forecasts globally this work can be used to improve water resources management and hydrological hazard mitigation especially in data sparse regions keywords global hydrological forecasts hydrological models ulysses hydrosos bias correction multi model blending data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction freshwater supply is fundamental to human existence however droughts can be devastating e g wilhite et al 2007 and floods very destructive e g bubeck et al 2017 considerable advances in rainfall predictions at daily to seasonal timescales in recent years do not always solve the problem of predicting floods e g kobold and su≈°elj 2005 and droughts e g ali et al 2018 due to propagating uncertainties associated with hydrology and land processes any land surface and hydrological model dynamical or empirical or data driven needs information about the properties of the geology vegetation soil types etc which may not be easily available over data sparse regions thus large scale global hydrology and land surface models have uncertainties associated with model parameters derived from global datasets of soil properties topography and vegetation cover sood and smakhtin 2015 despite this schellekens et al 2017 show that using the average of a suite of such models can perform as a reasonable proxy for a locally calibrated model in some circumstances this gives us hope that we could provide reasonable regional forecasts of hydrological conditions in data sparse regions the world meteorological organization s wmo global hydrological status and outlook system hydrosos initiative approved for implementation at wmo congress resolution 25 cg 18 aims to utilise global scale modelled products from multiple sources to provide current global hydrological status and sub seasonal to seasonal outlooks jenkins et al 2020 the hydrosos initiative builds on existing knowledge and data to deliver monthly global hydrological forecasts that combine model output with local national and regional scale data so that the final product is locally informed wmo 2021 this is achievable as new sources of observations and state of the art models are closing the knowledge gap in the understanding of the water cycle and its forecasting lahoz and de lannoy 2014 lavers et al 2020 multi model hydrological forecasts have been shown to provide reliable predictions for different regions velazquez et al 2011 wanders and wood 2016 as blending forecasts from multiple models has been successful regionally e g ajami et al 2006 it can be applied globally to provide holistic hydrological predictions however it is critical that any new hydrological forecast s blending is tested in a scientifically justifiable and operationally implementable way different multi model blending techniques have long been used to improve forecasts by leveraging the skill of certain models while excluding the errors in others e g shamseldin et al 1997 roy et al 2020 the simplest blending method uses an average of all model members which can include model simulation standardisation to remove forecast bias georgakakos et al 2004 ajami et al 2006 however the simple average blending does not exploit enhanced skill of certain models selectively which can be implemented using weighted averaging methods by assigning weights to the model members e g diks and vrugt 2010 weights can be estimated based on different methods e g multiple linear regression wanders and wood 2016 sub ensemble selection methods thober and samaniego 2014 thober et al 2015 constrained least squares technique ajami et al 2006 using machine learning methods zaherpour et al 2019 or bayesian model averaging methods darbandsari and coulibaly 2019 which reward the skillful models and penalise the less skillful ones arsenault et al 2015 however some of these methods can become computationally intensive and time consuming when applied at a global scale neuman 2003 jozaghi et al 2021 wang et al 2023 studies can also assign weights to the models directly based on their skill metrics such as in arsenault et al 2015 which can be less computationally intensive methods but may not be optimal over ungauged basins arsenault and brissette 2016 further although weighted averaging outperforms individual models most of the time e g abrahart and see 2002 duan et al 2007 sometimes the best performing individual model performs better e g arsenault and brissette 2016 thus studies have shown that it is imperative to rigorously investigate any new modelling system s post processed output performance for generalised global applications duan et al 2007 our ultimate goal is to develop a methodology to improve global hydrological predictions which can be best achieved by using global multi model forecast products such forecast products can help us deliver holistic i e forecasts for different variables over the same catchments and skillful predictions while sending a simplified message to the users through multi model blending roy et al 2020 given the global nature of our end product it is essential that the blending method used should be computationally non intensive while being sophisticated enough to exploit the skill of models considering the computational cost has a three fold objective the economic cost time efficiency and carbon footprint all are especially important if these methods are to be applied in an operational set up the latter carbon footprint of intensive computational science is a growing concern in the scientific community in an era where international efforts are focused in achieving net zero as the energy needed to power intensive computing is the main source of green house gas emissions from scientific activities eichhorn et al 2022 lannelongue and inouye 2023 since the model blending is a post processing step of an already computationally expensive product ensemble of global distributed hydrological simulations it is paramount that the additional carbon footprint of this step is kept as minimal as possible while still providing added value to the end product further bias correcting the simulations using simple methods before blending the multi model output has shown to significantly improve performance for the forecasts e g dion et al 2021 thus in this study we analyse the possibility of using the performance metric of the model as a weight for blending a global multi model output in a simple and computationally inexpensive way tested using the baseline simulations and also investigate the improvements by bias correcting the simulations before blending we test our blending methods on ungauged catchments by modelling the performance of the models over catchments without observations for three different hydrological variables streamflow soil moisture and evaporation we compare our blending method which uses model performance metrics as weights against the arithmetic averaging method which was used as the benchmark these methods investigated in the study provide a promising future for global water resource management and flood forecasting especially over data sparse regions the article is organised as follows section 2 introduces the data the methods used are provided in section 3 the results are described in section 4 the recommendations from our results section 5 1 limitations of our study section 5 2 and future avenues of research section 5 3 are discussed in section 5 and summary and conclusions are given in section 6 2 data for this study we used 119 sample catchments across the world fig 1 all of the study catchments have global runoff data centre grdc bfg 2020 daily streamflow data available along with catchment characteristics table s1 we wanted to evaluate the performance of more than 100 basins with extensive spatial coverage across the world and large hydroclimatic heterogeneity to be able to investigate the performance of ulysses forecasts across the globe for different types of catchments thus the 119 catchments were chosen on the following criteria i catchments are larger than 5000 km2 ii distributed in most hydroclimatic zones based on the budyko analysis iii manual quality check of observations did not reveal significant errors abrupt changes or constant values iv at least 5 years of grdc observed data were available on record between 1981 2019 v subjective selection of catchments to be spread across the globe samaniego et al 2020 setting a larger threshold for observation years for catchment selection would have led to fewer catchments available over africa asia and south america our selection criteria left us with 7 catchments in africa 16 in asia 34 in south america 35 in northern america 10 in australia and 17 in europe fig 1 we used output from the ulysses contract multi model hydrological seasonal predictions system samaniego et al 2020 ufz 2020 in this study which will be available at copernicus climate change service c3s as global seasonal forecasts and reforecasts of river discharge and related hydrological variables ensemble from four state of the art land surface and hydrological models for brevity we refer to this dataset as ulysses dataset the four land surface and hydrological models are mesoscale hydrologic model mhm samaniego et al 2010 kumar et al 2013 is a spatially explicit distributed hydrological model developed by helmholtz centre for environmental research pcr globwb pgb sutanudjaja et al 2018 is a grid based global hydrology and water resources model developed at

uk met office and uk centre for ecology and hydrology it is used both as a standalone model and as the land surface component in the met office unified model ulysses uses the four hydrological models to output multiple hydrological variables as gridded output e g runoff evapotranspiration soil moisture samaniego et al 2020 the streamflow output of different rivers for all four models is derived through the multiscale routing model mrm thober et al 2019 in this study we evaluate blending of three output variables evapotranspiration et surface soil moisture sm and streamflow sf for the modelled baseline period of 1981 2019 we use monthly mean values for the three variables extracted for the 119 catchments sf is extracted at the catchment outflow point on the river network for each of the 119 catchments to compare against the observations figure s1 et and sm are extracted as area averaged values for the same 119 catchments from gridded output figures s2 s3 we derive the catchment extent from the digital elevation information from global multi resolution terrain elevation data 2010 gmted2010 danielson and gesch 2011 for each catchment we validate our blended output against observations for the three variables for et we use global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam version 3 5a actual evaporation data figure s2a martens et al 2017 for sm we use the european space agency esa climate change initiative cci volumetric soil moisture product version 02 2 figure s3a liu et al 2011 dorigo et al 2017 for sf we use grdc observed sf from the global runoff data centre d 56002 koblenz germany figure s1 grdc wmo 2021 using these observations leads to some missing observations for sf figure s1 and some catchments having no observed data for sm figure s3a implications of which is discussed in section 5 2 however we evaluate all the three variables for the same 119 catchments as we would like to analyse if the ulysses output can provide skillful yet holistic hydrological forecasts over different regions of the world further as we are evaluating the performance of the models at catchment scale we need to have observations representing the whole catchment which are usually generated through remote sensing or modelling network of in situ observations for et and sm rather than using station or point observations which may not be able to represent intra catchment variability thus this method of analysis allows us to investigate if ulysses can provide hydrologically consistent global forecasts 3 methodology to provide a skillful blended hydrological products using the ulysses simulations we evaluate different blended approaches applied on native original and bias corrected model variables at a monthly time step for all the 119 catchments for the baseline period 1981 2019 we also evaluate the application of our methods on daily vs monthly sf values we further investigate the application of blending approaches on ungauged stations fig 2 summarises the methods used in this study as a flow chart the following subsections describe these approaches in detail 3 1 blending approaches we use the following two blending approaches to generate blended output for native and bias corrected simulations 1 arithmetic average the simplest form of blending multi model output is an average of the four model variables without any weighting as used in shamseldin et al 1997 arsenault et al 2015 and will be referred to as the arithmetic blending approach fig 3 shows an example of the observed and native simulated variables along with the arithmetic blended versions which is referred to as native arithmetic output we also blend the bias corrected variables discussed in section 3 2 and the blended output is referred to as bias corrected arithmetic output figs 2 3 the performance of the arithmetic blended output is used as a benchmark to compare other blending approaches in this study 2 weighted average the weighted average method uses weights based on model performance and from here on is referred to as weighted blending approach model performance at each catchment was assessed for monthly mean variables et sm sf from all four models over the baseline period using the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 the kge metric evaluates the model performance for contribution of mean variance and correlation see section 3 4 for more detail for this approach the kge metric for each model and variable is identified as their respective weights and the blended output is calculated using weighted averaging native weighted and bias corrected weighted please note that each catchment has its own set of weights here we apply weighted arithmetic mean in which sum of the catchment values multiplied with their respective weights is divided by the sum of weights we only use positive kge values as weights for any model with a negative kge metric the weight is set to zero and thus ignored for any catchment and variable with all models showing negative kge metric we use arithmetic blending approach instead i e all model weights are set to one this only occurs for 25 catchments for sm 1 catchment for sf and no catchments for et for native simulations and only 8 catchments for sm bias corrected simulations fig 3 shows examples of the native and bias corrected variables for each model along with their weighted blended counterparts referred to as native weighted and bias corrected weighted output fig 2 we also test another version of the original weighted blending approach in which we use the kge metric calculated for sf and apply it to the et and sm simulations we will refer to this method as sf weighted blending native sf weighted and bias corrected sf weighted outputs for et and sm this approach is intended to derive blended hydrological products that still maintain the catchment hydrological balance which for some applications can be more important than getting the best possible estimate for all three variables 3 2 bias correction the bias correction methodology tested here is based on farmer et al 2018 and is applied by sanchez lozano et al 2021 to operationally bias correct geo global water sustainability geoglows sf forecasts although farmer et al 2018 recommend 14 complete years of observed data to be able to accurately calculate the percentiles the method is applied here to all stations regardless of the length of record shortest record is of 5 years however the median length observations is 29 years over all study catchments compared to the full period of 39 years between 1981 2019 and out of 119 catchments 98 have more than 14 years of observations please note we have not performed bias correction for sm over catchments with fully missing data for bias correction of sf model output we first calculate a flow duration curve fdc for all data for daily data this is done for each month separately in observed and simulated time series fig 4 shows an example of the fdcs for an example catchment for the model htessel using the fdcs the non exceedance probability of every simulated value can be estimated the observed sf value corresponding to that non exceedance probability can be deduced the simulated value is then converted by replacing it with the equivalent observed sf to the same non exceedance probability i e quantile mapping method this will be referred to as the bias corrected sf kge metrics are calculated for all the bias corrected sf simulations from the four models and arithmetic and weighted blending approaches are applied to get bias corrected arithmetic and bias corrected weighted blended sf time series for bias correction of et and sm the same approach is applied replacing sf in the fdc by the variable in question please note that for the daily sf bias correction was performed for each month separately whereas for the monthly data sf et and sm the time series was not split into months as the records were not long enough 3 3 modelling kge weights at ungauged basins to apply the weighted average blending technique section 3 1 at ungauged basins the kge metric needs to be modelled which can then be used as weights for each model at the ungauged basins for blending in this study we refer to the ungauged basins where the observed data is hidden for testing the method over regions with no observations this method is only tested for sf as other hydrological variables et and sm have observations from remote measurements available all over the globe in the form of gridded data and thus do not have ungauged catchments catchment characteristics extracted for all 119 study catchments from the hydroatlas dataset linke et al 2019 were used to build the kge statistical model kge stats model to estimate sf kge at ungauged catchments using statistical approaches from the full list of 56 catchments attributes available in hydroatlas 17 attributes most relevant to hydrology and land surface modelling were retained table 1 for a full description of the variables please see the hydroatlas riveratlas catalogue lehner 2019 the number of variables were then further reduced by analysing the cross correlation between the catchment attributes and the hydrological models performance kge metric cross correlation between the 17 variables allows for the identification of a subset of 9 variables with high correlations for the modelling of kge at ungauged catchments we tested different machine learning methods multiple linear regression polynomial regression support vector regression decision tree regression random forest regression and xgboost regression for each of these six methods we conducted two combinations of experiments i with all 17 variables and with a subset of 9 variables selected after cross correlation analysis as input predictors ii with principal component analysis pca to reduce dimensionality and without pca in addition to the regression methods an artificial neural network ann with one hidden layer was also built the ann was tested with a range of different number of neurons in the hidden layer different batch sizes and number of epochs all the regression and ann models were built separately for each of the four hydrological models and assessed individually to identify the best kge stats model this means that each hydrological model has a different statistical model to estimate kge therefore the best kge stats model for htessel is not necessarily the same as the one for jules for example to assess the performance of each kge stats model their r2 score coefficient of determination was compared using the leave one out cross validation loocv method sammut and webb 2010 loocv consists of leaving one observation out from the dataset to build the model and using the observation left out to assess the model this process is repeated for every observation available in the dataset where each time a different observation is left out the best kge stats model based on this assessment was selected for each of the four hydrological models and were used to produce a set of estimated kge metric for all four models at all 119 case study catchments we expand on the modelling of kge metrics in section 4 3 the blended output is calculated after applying the new modelled kge metrics as weights to the native sf simulations referred to as native modelled weighted this modelled weighted blending approach identifies how well the weighted blended approach for sf performs over ungauged stations kge of the resulting modelled weighted blended product is calculated to quantify and compare its performance with the original weighted approach 3 4 validation using the methods described in section 3 1 3 3 we develop different blended products

corrected sf weighted blended output for et and sm the respective observed datasets are used to validate the native and bias corrected model simulations and the blended outputs validation can only be carried out for the period over which the observed data is available and thus model simulations and blended output for sm and sf are masked over the period where the corresponding observed data is missing please note that some catchments are missing for sm due to missing observations for the whole study period see figure s3a section 2 we verify the bias mean and variance of the model simulations and blended output using the kge and nash sutcliffeefficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 metrics calculated at monthly time step 1 k g e 1 r 1 2 œÉ s i m œÉ o b s 1 2 Œº s i m Œº o b s 1

and Œº o b s are means of the simulations and observations respectively kge equal to 1 indicates a perfect agreement between the simulations and observed kge less than 0 indicates poor model

have similar performance as the mean of the observations and nse less than 0 indicates model simulation is worse than the observed mean the kge metric is one of the most commonly used metric to evaluate model performance in the field of hydrology knoben et al 2019 and has been extensively used for model calibration and evaluation e g siqueira et al 2018 sutanudjaja et al 2018 for clarity we would like to draw the reader s attention to the different uses made of the kge metric throughout this study kge was used to define the weights assigned to each of the four models for the weighted blending approach the kge metric is used instead of nse metric because kge improves upon some of the drawbacks of nse associated with underestimating runoff variability by better representing the constitutive components correlation variability bias and mean bias gupta et al 2009 for native and bias corrected simulations respective kge values have been calculated for each catchment and each model as each variable will have its own set of weights the water balance of the blended product will not be maintained therefore as a separate experiment kge calculated for sf is also applied to et and sm sf weighted blending so that the same set of weights is used for all variables which maintains catchment water balance within each model kge for sf was also modelled using statistical approaches to be used as weights for the native simulations to produce the modelled weighted blending to be tested for ungauged catchments kge was used as one of the validation metrics to compare the performance of the different individual models and blending approaches for each variable et sm and sf and for native and bias corrected simulations this study also compares the baseline model simulations and blended output as categorical forecasts divided into 5 categories low 0 10 below normal 10 33 normal 33 67 above normal 67 90 and high 90 100 these categories can be combined to consider the outputs simply as equal terciles but the five categories provide the likelihood of more extreme events better the categorical verification of simulation allows for the evaluation of forecast skill for specific categories rather than for models identifying the exact value of the variable simulated bias corrected and blended outputs categorical skill is measured using accuracy acc wilks 2011 and heidke skill score hss heidke 1926 these skill scores represent absolute categorical skill acc of the output and skill relative to that of a random chance hss 3 a c c 1 n i 1 c n s i o i where n is the total number of simulations c is the number of categories 5 for this study and n s i o i are the number of times that the model simulates correctly for the category i acc measures how many times the model hits the correct category but it can be influenced by the most common category acc has range of 0 to 1 with 1 for a perfect simulation 4 h s s 1 n i 1 c n s i o i 1 n 2 i 1 c n s

hss ranges from to 1 1 is the perfect score and anything less than 0 shows that correct simulations are due to random chance 4 results 4 1 arithmetic and weighted blending for each catchment arithmetic average and weighted average blended output is calculated from all four model native and bias corrected simulations for all three variables section 3 1 fig 3a c shows an example catchment native model time series for all four models for the three variables and the native blended model outputs for 1993 for the sao paulo de olivenca river catchment all models underestimate et fig 3a overestimate sm fig 3b and have their phase shifted for peak sf fig 3c native pgb simulations perform best over this catchment blending native simulations reduces the errors but the weighted blending only shows improvement over arithmetic blending for sm in this catchment we note that different catchments and different years have very different errors and improvements with blending and bias correction not shown thus we summarise our results using kge metric figure s4 fig 5 comparison between the native simulations and weighted blended sf shows that the blended product out performs the individual models for 75 of the catchments figure s4c fig 5c but there is only moderate improvement for et and sm figure s4a b fig 5a b the native arithmetic blended has lower performance than the native weighted blended output for all three variables fig 5 for et and sf mhm native simulations have similar performance to the native arithmetic blended output mhm may be performing better as it uses multiscale parameter regionalisation mpr technique which can parameterise across basins and scales using nonlinear transfer functions and is shown to perform better than standard regionalisation samaniego et al 2010 sm has the largest spread in kge metric compared to et and sf despite lower number of catchments verified figure s4b section 2 for sm 15 catchments figure s4b have no observations for the whole baseline period figure s3a for all four models kge metric for sm is in general lower than for the other two variables suggesting that sm is particularly challenging to estimate from global models or from satellite sensors for observations please see section 5 2 for more detailed discussion the same arithmetic and weighted blending methods are also used to blend the bias corrected simulations using the kge metric from the bias corrected simulations fig 3d f modelled kge metric is used for weighted averaging of native simulations to evaluate performance of the method over ungauged catchments for sf these two points will be discussed in the subsequent subsections 4 2 bias correction of variables each model simulation is bias corrected using the method described in section 3 2 as the ulysses global product cannot be calibrated to every location the bias correction further aligns the estimated streamflow to local conditions and thus provides an added value for users applying the forecasts at local scale the new kge metric from the bias corrected model simulations is used as weights for blending the bias corrected model simulations to calculate the bias corrected weighted blended output bias corrected simulations are also simply averaged to get the bias corrected arithmetic blended product fig 3d f shows an example of bias corrected and blended output bias correction fig 3d e improves the native et and sm simulations fig 3a b for sf bias correction fig 3f improves the magnitude but does not correct the timing i e the phase shift seen in the native sf simulations fig 3c as expected the bias corrected simulations for individual models outperform the native simulations for all three variables figure s4 showing that bias correction improves model performance other studies also show the importance of bias correction of hydrological forecasts to improve prediction skill e g zalachori et al 2012 the improvement is smaller with et where the native simulations already perform well fig 5a but the improvement is larger for sm and sf fig 5b c bias correction almost always improves the performance of any model output as shown for the sf simulations in fig 6 the bias corrected arithmetic or weighted blended output outperforms native arithmetic or weighted blended output for almost all the catchments for the three variables figure s4 fig 5 it should be noted that this bias correction method for sf can only be performed over gauged catchments which have observed data available bias correction of ungauged catchments is beyond the scope of this study but bias correcting simulations before producing a blended product is important for any operational implementation 4 3 kge estimation at ungauged stations at ungauged catchments where observed data is not available to calculate performance metrics kge weights for sf need to be estimated in order to implement the weighted blending approach we model sf kge using the method described in section 3 3 cross correlation analysis between the different catchment characteristics fig 7a and correlation of each of the catchment characteristics table 1 with the kge of each of the four hydrological model variables fig 7b shows that some characteristics are highly correlated amongst themselves where two catchment characteristics were highly correlated the one that was most correlated to the kge of the hydrological models was retained thus we select a subset of 9 catchment characteristics discharge lake area slope precip pet snow forest and soil water content see table 1 for the list of full names of catchment characteristics from fig 7b we can observe that in general the correlations between the models kge and the various catchment characteristics are weak one notable exception is the high correlation observed between jules kge and soil water content positive correlation and pasture cover negative correlation these two catchment characteristics are highly correlated between them negatively this observation indicates that jules struggles to simulate river flows for catchments where pastures are the dominating land cover all models performances are negatively correlated with the degree of regulation pgb s performance increases with snow cover extent which suggests the snow module of this model is more efficient than the other models with the exception of htessel models are generally worse at predicting flow in regions with high evaporative demand pet htessel is worse than the other models at simulating flows where lakes are present from the different kge stats models tested section 3 3 the best performing model was selected based on the r2 score coefficient of determination for each of the four hydrological models table 2 pca did not improve the r2 score for any of the kge stats model tested and the ann model did not outperform the best regression model in any of the cases the sample size is believed to be too small to effectively train an ann model note that the r2 score even with the best of the kge stat models is relatively low especially for mhm which means that kge is difficult to predict accurately from catchment characteristics alone using the kge stats model shown in table 2 the modelled kge metric for each of the 119 study catchments for all four hydrological models was derived fig 6 for example the support vector regression method is applied to estimate kge values which we called the modelled kge of the pgb model for all catchments as if the real kge values for these catchments cannot be calculated due to the observations being unavailable one modelled kge value is derived for each catchment and each hydrological model these modelled kge values are then used for the weighted averaging of the four model simulations to derive the native modelled weighted blended output section 3 3 over most catchments the modelled kge closely matches the native kge for all four models except for catchments with very low kge values red dots in fig 6 the statistical models estimate improved kge in such catchments which is not an accurate representation of hydrological model performance and thus not useful for blending methods over ungauged catchments the errors in modelled kge metric over such catchments may stem from failure in dynamically modelling such catchments e g very dry basins are challenging to model and thus it may be beyond the capability of these statistical models to estimate the kge metric based on catchment characteristics alone further in depth research may be required to develop these methods further these new modelled kge metrics were used as weights for the native sf simulations to derive the modelled weighted blended product see section 3 3 3 4 the modelled weighted blended product has similar performance as native weighted blended output over catchments where the kge stats model estimates the kge metric well as expected and different poorer or better in some cases performance over catchments where the kge stats model estimates the kge metric poorly not shown modelled weighted simulations outperforms arithmetic blended in most cases but not as much as weighted blending using observed kge weights fig 8a 4 4 validation from the methods discussed in above three subsections a combination of blended products are derived native arithmetic average native weighted average also alternatively native sf weighted average for et and sm modelled weighted average only for sf bias corrected arithmetic average and bias corrected weighted average also alternatively bias corrected sf weighted average for et and sm fig 5 shows that blending of any type improves kge achieved compared with the native simulations from the four individual models except for sm arithmetic blending as discussed before bias correction improves individual model simulation fig 6 although the degree of improvement is catchment and model specific figure s4 blending bias corrected simulations shows the highest improvement compared to all the other approaches for example only 6 out of the 119 catchments show poorer performance for the bias corrected weighted blended sf compared to the native weighted blended sf figure s4 the comparison between bias corrected weighted blended product and bias corrected arithmetic blended product shows improvement for all three variables albeit only marginal except for sm figs 5 8a c for sm the bias corrected weighted blending performs much better than bias corrected arithmetic blending especially for stations where the catchments have a negative kge for native simulations not shown further for the blending of the native simulations performance of the blended output is improved by the use of kge weights figs 5 8b thus weighted blending is useful with both native and bias corrected simulations as mentioned in section 3 1 we also test the original weighted blending method against the sf weighted for et and sm and we show the differences of these two weighted blending approaches against arithmetic blending of native and bias corrected simulations in fig 8b c for both native and bias corrected simulations weighted blended outperforms the sf weighted blended for both et and sm in fact the sf weighted blending mostly performs similarly or slightly worse than the arithmetic blending the performance difference is larger in sm than in et fig 8b c as the kge spread in sm simulations is larger fig 5b we also test the weighted blending approaches over ungauged stations for sf by modelling kge using catchment characteristics modelled weighted blending section 4 3 for the native simulations modelled weighted performs slightly worse than weighted blending but is still overall better than arithmetic blending fig 8a thus overall the kge stats model was capable of estimating the sf kge for ungauged catchments to a certain degree but as mentioned in section 3 3 kge is not solely attributable to catchment characteristics please note that we have not compared weighted and modelled weighted blending for bias corrected sf simulations fig 8a as this was beyond the scope of this study the performance of models native and blended simulations is also measured with another performance metric nse fig 5d f performance with nse shows similar results to performance with kge blended products show higher performance compared to individual models except for mhm in et and sf bias correction improves model performance more in sm and sf than et and kge based weights improve performance more when applied to native simulations than bias corrected simulations we also compare the application of our methods on daily vs monthly sf simulations using kge and nse performance metrics figure s5 applying our methods to daily simulations shows similar improvement in performance as compared to methods applied to monthly simulations and the overall conclusions for blending and bias correction methods performance remain the same categorical forecast skill calculated for five categories see section 3 4 is measured using acc and hss skill scores compared to the performance metrics kge and nse using skill scores acc and hss show smaller improvements after blending fig 9 hss for et and sf are positive which indicates that the accuracy of getting each category right is better than that from a random chance fig 9d f but sm has some negative hss values fig 9e there is no improvement in performance with bias correction which is to be expected as the bias correction will not modify the relative values of the variables there is improvement in the native arithmetic and weighted blended products as compared to individual models in sf but this improvement is not very large in et and sm pgb performs the worst amongst the individual models with both skill scores for the native sf simulations mhm outperforms the other models for sf and has similar skill to the blended products fig 9c f this may be due to the fact that mhm uses the mpr technique to parameterise across basins and scales see section 4 1 further it should be noted that there are large gaps in the observed data for some stations with sf section 2 which shortens the length of the time period of evaluation and may lead to poorer categorical skill for sf with blended products for certain stations 5 discussion in this study we aimed to identify simple blending approaches and thus their feasibility for implementation in operational forecasts however this is a pilot study and has only been conducted for baseline simulations for just three variables and 119 catchments thus more future work is required before implementation of these methods operationally in this section we discuss the practical implications of our study that need to be carefully considered before implementation 5 1 recommendations our results show that arithmetic blending rarely improved performance over that of the best performing individual model which has also been shown by other studies e g mo and lettenmaier 2014 weighted blending adds value to native simulations but bias correction leads to much higher improvement other studies have also found that bias correction of forecasts as a post processing method is very effective for multi model ensemble hydrological forecasts e g dion et al 2021 bohn et al 2010 also show that individual best bias corrected model outperforms the multi model arithmetic average and blending after bias correction only marginally improves forecast performance over individual bias corrected models thus bias correction is recommended wherever possible when providing categorical forecasts bias correction is not necessary as the improvement in performance in bias corrected weighted blending is modest thus native weighted blended product can be used instead however multi model blending for categorical forecasts could still be beneficial in order to simplify the message to the end users where the application of bias correction is difficult e g ungauged catchments weighted blending using modelled kge is a good alternative and performs better than arithmetic averaging applications of the multi model merging improves the quality of forecasts by maintaining the ensemble dispersion with lead time e g thiboult et al 2016 xu et al 2019 and enhances the reliability of any forecasting system by incorporating the model uncertainty e g ahmed et al 2019 merging multi model streamflow forecasts using methods like bayesian model averaging leads to an improvement in skill e g duan et al 2007 luo and wood 2008 however these are approaches that have been investigated on the multi model probabilistic forecasts rather than baseline simulations as in this study probabilistic forecasts include hydrological model uncertainty as in baseline simulations but also have uncertainty related to the atmospheric ensemble forecasts used to drive the models e g krzysztofowicz 2001 as the skill of these forecasts vary in space and time the effect of the uncertainties from the atmospheric forcing on the hydrological forecasts could also vary with lead time and catchment characteristics at shorter lead times forecasts will be influenced more by the initial conditions whereas for longer lead times the climate forcing will have a stronger effect e g li et al 2009 for slow responding catchments the uncertainties in the climate forcing will have less importance than for flashy catchments e g sutanto and van lanen 2022 this means that the benefits of our blending and bias correction method found in this study for the baseline might not transfer directly or uniformly when applied to forecasts thus there is further need to investigate the uncertainty before implementing our method to probabilistic forecasts using consistent weights for all variables i e sf kge weighted blended product has poorer performance as compared to using kge from respective variables thus it is expected that we use the better performing blending approach i e the weighted blended product for operational forecasts using weights based on skill of the individual models to merge multi model ensemble simulations has been shown to reduce the bias in climate simulations thober and samaniego 2014 however weighting each variable with different kge weights provides us with forecasts without local hydrological balance and will not be suited for certain user requirements for applications where water balance closure is necessary e g drought forecasting systems predicting water availability in both rivers and soils blended product using sf weights gives an alternative to arithmetic averaging which optimises sf blended product with et and sm blended product similar or slightly worse than arithmetic blended product multi model blending at daily timesteps has similar performance to blending at monthly timesteps and we therefore recommend the use of simulations at either timestep as per the user requirement this result is different in snowmelt dominated catchments where the performance generally improves on aggregating the sf merged simulations from daily to monthly time scales e g bohn et al 2010 5 2 limitations our study is limited by the number of catchments evaluated and the missing data for the variables sm and sf although we attempt to make our results as robust as possible we could not ascertain the exact influence nested catchments have on the results uncertainty analysis performed using bootstrapping different sample sizes of catchments not shown suggests that our recommendations from section 5 1 remain valid even with a smaller sample catchments another limitation of our study is that we consider the validation data to be the truth but in reality it has its own errors the errors in sm observations play an important role in poor performance of sm simulations over the catchments studied e g rakovec et al 2016 the sm observations are derived from a remote sensing product that has some errors and the et observations are a blended observed modelled product however these validation datasets are the best estimate of observations available to us for such a global analysis investigating the performance of all three variables over the same catchment sample but we do recognise the observational uncertainty inherent in our methodology further many previous studies have used these same et and sm observations to calibrate hydrological models to improve sf forecasts e g l√≥pez l√≥pez et al 2017 demb√©l√© et al 2020 ding and zhu 2022 gleam et dataset performs well at a regional e g yang et al 2017 or global e g miralles et al 2011 scale when validated against in situ observations in different studies e g martens et al 2018 similarly studies have also shown that cci sm product performs well against in situ observations regionally e g gonz√°lez zamora et al 2019 and globally e g dorigo et al 2015 we ourselves have validated the cci sm product against international soil moisture network ismn stations using the qa4sm platform https qa4sm eu ui home using multiple metrics the results from mean squared error mse figure s6a unbiased root mean squared difference ubrmsd figure s6a and other metrics not shown clearly show that cci sm has high performance and skill when validated against observations these findings have given us confidence that we can use these datasets as proxy for observations to validate the ulysses model simulations especially over data sparse regions for sm an additional source of error stems from the fact that sm depth from models is different to the measurements from satellites as satellites only estimate moisture in the top few centimetres of soil whereas land surface models simulate moisture at greater depth some studies e g beale et al 2021 have investigated the possibility to correct for the mismatch in depth using soil moisture depth profile modelling when comparing soil moisture from different sources and have shown that this can account for large differences however these methods require a range of input parameters soil hydraulic properties vegetation cover and type etc which are not readily available for global studies such as ours therefore we have followed the approach taken in other studies e g peng et al 2021 schellekens et al 2017 and have directly compared the modelled sm with the sm observations although we do acknowledge that this may lead to some uncertainties and our calculated model performance may not reflect the true model performance 5 3 future work blended forecast products derived from the ulysses project are not limited to the three variables evaluated in this study thus there is a need to assess the skill of the blended products for the whole set of forecast variables e g runoff snow cover terrestrial water storage implementing our blending approaches over more catchments will provide better estimates of uncertainty further research may also evaluate blending approaches on a grid point level rather than just catchment level modelling kge for ungauged catchments sf have shown somewhat promising results however as noted in the results catchment characteristics do not completely represent the kge for ungauged catchments improved modelling of kge in future research can lead to improved weighted blending approaches multi model streamflow forecast show an improvement in skill upon merging the individual ensembles of all models e g duan et al 2007 luo and wood 2008 however the blending and bias correction approaches used in this study were tested on the model simulations from baseline period 1981 2019 which have a single simulated output per model as a next step ulysses data should be evaluated for all of its initialisations and the full ensemble of hindcasts and forecasts to assess its skill and ascertain the uncertainty of the forecasts at different lead times ulysses provides global hindcasts 1993 2019 and operational forecasts 2020 2021 for each model at monthly lead times with 6 months extent each all model forecasts have a five member ensemble for each initialisation except for february may august and november initialisations which have 25 members each for operational blended forecasts performance metrics for weighting derived from the hindcast period might yield forecasts with better skill however additional uncertainty coming from errors in atmospheric forecasts may mean that the improvements found in our research do not directly translate into improvements in hydrological forecasts thus further assessment on the hindcasts are needed further understanding of the performance using the hindcasts will allow identification of forecast and ensemble uncertainty skill for blended products should also be assessed for anomalies or categories of variables rather than just for absolute values to identify the best forecast product that can be provided to the users 6 summary and conclusions this study analyses different approaches for blending multi model simulations derived from the ulysses project focusing on computationally inexpensive methods in an effort to limit the carbon footprint and cost of this post processing step the verification of the blending methods has been performed for 119 sample catchments for the baseline period of 1981 2019 using et sm and sf variables the blending approach tested here is weighted averaging of the native multi model simulations using catchment performance metric kge for each variable as the weight the arithmetic multi model averaging method is used to identify the added value of the weighted blended approach the analysis also includes bias correction of model simulations before applying the two blending approaches further the blending approaches are also tested for sf over ungauged catchments by modelling the kge metric based on catchment characteristics we also apply sf kge weights for weighted blending of et and sm to have a hydrologically balanced forecast our results show that the weighted blending approach has added value over the arithmetic blending when applied to the native simulation over most catchments weighted blending also adds value when applied to the bias corrected simulations but the improvement seen is lower than with native simulations bias correction improves individual model simulations for all three variables absolute values but not the categorical forecasts results indicate that greater improvement is achieved through bias correction than through weighted blending from all the approaches tested the best performing method is the bias correction followed by weighted blending therefore bias correction of simulations before blending using weights is the recommended method unless only categorical forecasts are considered in which case native weighted blending is the recommended method modelling of kge for sf has proven to be a viable option to apply weighted blending at ungauged catchments applying consistent weights for blending across all the three variables based on sf kge metric for hydrologically consistent forecasts shows poorer performance than using variables respective weights however using consistent weights for blending for all variables is a possible option if the local water balance needs to be maintained the sf weighted blending shows similar performance to arithmetic blending for et slightly poorer for sm but shows vastly improved performance for sf thus this method might be the most suited for certain applications where the water balance closure is more important e g drought forecasting systems predicting water availability in both rivers and soils than the accuracy of each individual variable the findings of this study show promising results for the application of blending approaches along with bias correction for global hydrological forecasts more detailed investigations are required for application of this method for

1896,soil moisture sm is a critical parameter for land atmosphere interaction measuring drought conditions in agricultural areas and it can significantly affect surface water and agricultural production based on remote sensing observations the temperature vegetation dryness index tvdi can be generated to evaluate sm at a large spatial scale land surface temperature lst and vegetation index vi plots are generated to obtain the triangular trapezoidal space to calculate tvdi for the present study tvdi was calculated by using lst and normalized difference vegetation index ndvi or the enhanced vegetation index evi for a period of three years 2017 2018 and 2019 over the ganga basin the applicability of the tvdi at soil depths of 0 10 10 40 40 100 and 100 200 cm was also examined the result from the study indicates that a better correlation is obtained between tvdi generated using evi and sm compared to tvdi generated using ndvi temporal variation of tvdi with sm shows that tvdi evi almost captures the maximum and minimum sm variation in most locations also sm at 10 40 cm shows a better negative correlation r close to 0 5 with tvdi evi than 0 10 cm depth for the summer season the result thus reveals the potential of tvdi in assessing sm especially in summer season while using evi as the vegetation index keywords temperature vegetation dryness index tvdi soil moisture soil depths correlation ganga basin data availability open source data is used 1 introduction land surface energy exchange and hydrological conditions significantly affect the changes in atmospheric conditions soil moisture sm is considered as the crucial component necessary to control all hydrological and climatological fluxes regulating land atmosphere feedback mechanism guo and dirmeyer 2006 nair and indu 2019 krishnan nair and indu 2021 to provide valuable results for studies such as hydrology meteorology and agriculture it is essential to provide reliable and spatially distributed measurements of sm sabaghy et al 2020 krishnan et al 2021 while sm information is indispensable its widespread and continuous measurement remains challenging it is time consuming and difficult to consistently perform in situ measurements of sm variation of sm depends on many factors such as soil type and land cover so sm variations are difficult to assess by site specific ground observation in addition point measurements are frequently questioned concerning the relevance of regional applications grayson and western 1998 the accuracy of land surface model simulations is often compromised due to errors caused by atmospheric forcing and unawareness on critical variables at desired spatial and temporal scales rodell et al 2004 these shortcomings make remote sensing an attractive alternative for multispectral measurements over spatial and temporal domains patel et al 2008 passive microwave data from l band radiometers especially brightness temperature tb have the capability to provide useful knowledge about sm and land surface emissivity krishnan et al 2019 krishnan et al 2022a b globally passive microwave data are collected by the operational microwave satellites on board l band radiometers dedicated to sm monitoring namely soil moisture and ocean salinity smos kerr et al 2010 and soil moisture active passive smap entekhabi et al 2010 the main limitation remains the coarse resolution around 40 km of the satellite footprint the use of radiometric measurements at visible and infrared wavelengths has been proposed as a way to overcome this problem when crop canopy is

and details are shown in fig 2 and described in the following sections the combined product of terra and aqua products of modis generates an 8 day time series of both ndvi and evi in contrast lst and sm products are available daily therefore the entire data sets used for the present study are transformed to eight day temporal resolution same as vegetation indices 2 3 1 temperature vegetation dryness index tvdi the lst and turbulent energy fluxes are sensitive to sm while land cover types could severely affect the relationship between lst and sm sona et al 2012 tvdi analyzes the vegetation index vi within a region and the variation in lst while under the same vi value and then creates the lst vi feature space through the use of all the vi and lst available scatter plots of lst and vegetation index vi of an area comprising varying sm and vegetation types result in vi lst triangular space the varying evapotranspiration and sm status are represented by pixels within a triangle area by interpreting the vi lst space empirically a simple water stress index called temperature vegetation dryness index was proposed by sandholt et al 2002 it is empirically estimated assuming that i change in lst is mainly due to variation in sm and ii variation in thermal inertia and evapotranspiration affects tvdi sandholt rasmussen and andersen 2002 using tvdi we can determine the moisture status of the soil the highest value indicates dry soil while the lowest value indicates moist soil fig 3 shows the conceptual lst vi triangle space for tvdi calculation lst and the surface turbulent energy fluxes are sensitive and dependent on sm and water fluxes this dependence is modulated by vegetation through the process of transpiration qin et al 2021 extremely low sm can lead to decreased evaporation from soil and decreased rate of transpiration from plants due to less stomatal conductance black et al 1969 damour et al 2010 on the other hand wet soil condition can lead to increased evapotranspiration and thereby decreasing lst due to its cooling effect on soil two physical limits can be observed which represent the maximum and minimum limits of sm and evapotranspiration for various vi classes evapotranspiration is controlled by the lstmax dry edge in the root zone horizontal edge parallel to axis is termed as lstmin which indicates maximum amount of sm and shown as wet edge the tvdi at the dry edge may range from one less sm to zero at the wet edge high sm or saturated meanwhile the left edge parallel to y axis represents the dry to wet bare soil ground surface as it does not affect vegetation mallick et al 2009 holzman et al 2014a b from remotely sensed observations the tvdi is derived as follows 1 tvdi lst lst min lst max lst min lst is the observed land surface temperature in kelvin lstmin is the minimum lst wet edge intercept and lstmax is the maximum lst for a given vi as determined by equation 2 2 lst max a v i b a dry edge intercept and b dry edge slope are dry edge parameters fitted to the data as a linear equation and vi is the vegetation index ndvi or evi that corresponds to the observed lst now the equation 1 can be written as 3 tvdi lst lst min avi b lst min based on extracted values of maximum lst and ndvi values lstmax parameters were estimated for the study period to calculate wet edges lst vi scatter plots were used to average lst points for different vi intervals once the parameters are obtained the tvdi was calculated for each day using equation 3 tvdi was computed using both ndvi and evi to compare the performance of each vi tvdi values ranges from 0 to 1 previous research pham et al 2021 gao gao and chang 2011 wang et al 2004 has categorized tvdi into five classes based on the values obtained classified as very wet for tvdi value between 0 and 0 2 wet for 0 2 0 4 normal for 0 4 0 6 dry for 0 6 0 8 and very dry for 0 8 1 for the present study lst vi plots are created for the years 2017 2018 and 2019 to calculate the minimum lst maximum lst and parameters to calculate tvdi for each pixel the least square linear regression was used to determine dry edge using the maximum temperature and ndvi for small intervals of vi the dry edge parameters were calculated the pearson correlation coefficients r are used to evaluate the tvdi results as shown in equation 4 4 r i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 where represents the tvdi and y represents sm tvdi s applicability to soil moisture monitoring can be assessed by evaluating r s value 3 results and discussion 3 1 lst vi space lst vi plots are created for the years 2017 2018 and 2019 to calculate the minimum lst maximum lst and parameters to calculate tvdi for each pixel due to missing data during the dry season especially around the rivers lakes and irrigated fields these triangles have a concave shape primarily because they occurred in areas where the natural vegetation was least extensive based on the ndvi intervals the lst minimum was calculated as the mean temperature of areas partially covered with vegetation including soil surfaces fig 4 presents the slope and intercept parameters as a function of time for the dry edge during the year 2019 results show that the slope of dry edge 57 for evi and 48 for ndvi in the vi lst space of the summer season was clearer and negative than that of the post monsoon season 14 for evi and 13 for ndvi significant differences in fractional vegetation cover are mainly responsible for these subtle differences slopes and intercepts of the dry edge show a trend corresponding with rainfall patterns the dry edge increases after the summer season and after reaching a peak during monsoon falls in post monsoon season and the slope shows the reverse trends when ndvi and evi are compared ndvi shows a high dry edge intercept while evi shows a high wet edge the evi also indicates a high negative slope trend 3 2 spatial variation of tvdi the spatial pattern of tvdi generated using lst ndvi and lst evi are shown in figs 5 and 6 respectively the spatial pattern of all three seasons summer monsoon and post monsoon have been studied for the years of 2017 2018 and 2019 respectively tvdi values vary spatially and temporally in distinct ways over time the tvdi value of zero represents for wet pixels and one stands for dry pixels compared to monsoon and post monsoon high tvdi values are shown for the summer season spatial plots of monsoon season show that most areas have wet pixels tvdi value close to zero a high tvdi value is observed over the southwest part of the basin that covers hot arid and semi arid regions of the ganga basin the high tvdi values indicate that these areas are drier than the north which is predominantly irrigated the study area s north and northeastern regions have low tvdi ranges associated with higher sm retention capacity and fractional coverage in the region tvdi values were exceptionally low for rivers 0 1 as seen in fig 5 and fig 6 the increased precipitation and vegetation coverage during monsoon results in the lowest tvdi during monsoon every year in contrast high values in summer and post monsoon indicates dry region with less land cover most of the agricultural area will be harvested during this period and can result in dry areas in post monsoon most pixels of the tvdi fall between 0 3 and 0 5 however in the summer season tvdi values shows higher value above 0 5 which can be attributed to the increased lst and dryness comparing figs 5 and 6 it is significant that tvdi values generated using ndvi are higher than evi this can be visible in the southwest part of the study area where tvdi using ndvi shows values in the range of 0 8 compared to 0 6 of tvdi using evi ndvi values are asymptotically saturated in high biomass regions and include background and atmospheric noises shan et al 2013 kyparissis and levizou 2022 in the case of evi atmospheric effects and other noises are reduced resulting in less tvdi value in semi arid and vegetated areas increased vegetation monitoring capacity of evi can also be a factor in low tvdi this was shown in lst vi triangle space fig 3 where increased vegetation results in reduced tvdi thus the sm and its correlations with vegetation are frequently influenced by land use changes zhao et al 2022 2023 spatial variation of tvdi value also shows the topographical variation of the study region where high tvdi values are observed in central plateau and hill agro climatic zone of ganga basin central water commission ministry of water resources and national remote sensing nrsc 2014 with a majority of the land is not used for cultivation on the other hand low tvdi values showing high wetness or sm is shown in the upper and middle gangetic planes both these regions have a high level of cultivation of crops like rice and wheat even in the pre monsoon season summer the spatial value of tvdi is less in this region due to the agricultural practices especially rabi crop cultivation the extreme north part of the study region a part of the western himalayan region shows low tvdi value close to one in all the seasons due to the snow covered area 3 3 relationship between esa cci sm and tvdi correlation coefficient r between sm and tvdi has been derived for three seasons summer monsoon and pre monsoon over three years 2017 2018 and 2019 figs 7 and 8 show the spatial distributions of correlation coefficients between esa cci sm and tvdi with ndvi and evi respectively the relationship between tvdi and sm is considered significant when it is negative whereas the positive correlation is insignificant patel et al 2008 the spatial plot indicates a significant negative correlation between generated tvdi and sm especially tvdi developed using evi shows better correlation compared with the ndvi generated tvdi ndvi values cannot reflect the conditions of the ground that are dry or wet especially when the surface is saturated and has high evapotranspiration also evi proves to be more effective in densely vegetated areas so to some degree tvdi generated using evi and lst compensate for the inadequacy of tvdi based on ndvi and lst data for all regions the correlations between sm and the tvdi from summer season were better than the values determined for post monsoon season one of the notable results was shown in the year 2018 when both simulated tvdis were not significant as low correlation coefficient compared to the years 2017 and 2019 the correlation between the tvdi and sm in summer was in the range of 0 8 0 4 whereas post monsoon had a wide range of 0 8 0 9 under high vegetation cover the tvdi is less sensitive to sm than it would be under normal conditions further the variation of tvdi generated using both ndvi and evi with sm was evaluated for 5 different locations in the ganga basin fig 9 shows the variation of tvdi using ndvi with esa cci sm and fig 10 shows the interpretation of tvdi using evi with esa cci sm for five locations tvdi values plotted against sm show higher sm values correspond to lower tvdi values and vice versa especially for tvdi generated using evi and lst tvdi developed using ndvi could not capture the negative linear variation and trend except for purnia fig 10 e all the locations show a visible negative correlation with tvdi using evi the low correlation in purnia can be attributed to the consistent moist climate in purnia it is also the highest rainfall available place in bihar figs 9 and 10 thus show that evi outperforms the ndvi in capturing the sm variation as explained in the spatial plots 3 4 tvdi and gldas noah lsm sm at different soil layer figs 11 and 12 show the correlation between the sm and the tvdi with ndvi and tvdi with evi for different seasons across the years 2017 2018 and 2019 to explore the applicability of tvdis gldas noah lsm sm available at a depth of 0 10 cm 10 40 cm 40 100 cm and 100 200 cm are used for investigating the capability of tvdi in capturing sub surface sm variability the spatial variation of tvdi shows a considerable variation both over the area and seasonally initial analysis of the figures shows a better correlation of tvdi using evi with sm than tvdi with ndvi evaluating both the figures sm and the tvdi have high negative correlations for the 10 40 cm depth range in the summer season compared to all the other sm depths a distinct positive correlation trend was noticed in the post monsoon season with full crop cover most of the previous studies related to tvdi indicated only a negative correlation of sm with tvdi holzman et al 2014a b patel et al 2008 the region with high tvdi and lst is related to wet soil conditions due to dense vegetation also the region with low tvdi and low lst is related with dry soil due to sparse canopy ryu et al 2021 both the above conditions can lead to a positive correlation of tvdi with sm when vegetation cover is sparse in summer a better correlation is shown between sm and tvdi as the depth of sm increases as a result tvdi explains better the differences in deeper layers during the summer in the ganga basin seasonal differences in tvdi response were primarily due to the difference in lst to diverse vegetation conditions fig 13 shows the mean correlation coefficient of gldas sm at different soil layer depths with tvdi evi and lst 2017 2018 and 2019 analysis has been carried out only for tvdi using evi as spatial analysis shows less correlation coefficient for tvdi using ndvi in the summer season sm at 10 40 cm shows a better negative correlation with r close to 0 5 than 0 10 cm depth in most of the locations similar results are shown by c f chen et al 2011 where tvdi shows a strong negative correlation 0 43 at a depth of 10 20 cm due to the moist humid climate less correlation of tvdi with all the sub surface soil layers is found especially in purnia bihar also purnia is considered as the highest rainfall available place in bihar a distinct positive correlation is shown in all layers in every location during the post monsoon season with a better correlation of tvdi with sm at a 100 200 cm soil depth 4 summary and conclusion in this study the temperature vegetation dryness index tvdi was estimated at a high resolution 1 km to assess sm the study has been conducted over the ganga basin for a period of three years 2017 2018 and 2019 the triangle trapezoid feature space created by lst and vi was used to generate tvdi two different tvdi were developed using both vegetation indices ndvi and evi passive microwave sensor satellite coarse scaled sm product esa cci evaluated the generated tvdi gldas noah lsm sm was used to investigate the correlation between sm at different layers and tvdi tvdi obtained from the triangle space of lst evi was more suitable for sm monitoring than lst ndvi when canopy coverage is sparse tvdi showed a superior correlation with sm for all regions the correlations between sm and the tvdi from the summer season were better than the values determined for post monsoon season one of the notable results was shown in the year 2018 when both simulated tvdis were not significant as low correlation coefficient compared to the years 2017 and 2019 tvdi and sm show a better correlation in summer 0 8 0 4 the poor correlation in post monsoon can be attributed to significant vegetation cover reducing the effect of sm in tvdi during the pre monsoon season tvdi is more effective in monitoring sm at soil layer depths of 10 40 cm than at 0 10 cm a positive correlation of tvdi with sm at different layer depths was found predominantly in the post monsoon season spatial and temporal valuation of tvdi shows that its applicability can be used mainly in the summer and post monsoon season in the basin although this method can be applied at a regional scale to monitor soil moisture diversity in the vegetation and geographic condition and the presence of cloud cover in the data imposes problems despite some limitations tvdi purely based on remote sensing observation can still provide accurate high resolution sm information by downscaling the remote sensing soil moisture products the potential of this technique needs to be explored over areas with different climatical and geographical conditions for extended period of time credit

1896,soil moisture sm is a critical parameter for land atmosphere interaction measuring drought conditions in agricultural areas and it can significantly affect surface water and agricultural production based on remote sensing observations the temperature vegetation dryness index tvdi can be generated to evaluate sm at a large spatial scale land surface temperature lst and vegetation index vi plots are generated to obtain the triangular trapezoidal space to calculate tvdi for the present study tvdi was calculated by using lst and normalized difference vegetation index ndvi or the enhanced vegetation index evi for a period of three years 2017 2018 and 2019 over the ganga basin the applicability of the tvdi at soil depths of 0 10 10 40 40 100 and 100 200 cm was also examined the result from the study indicates that a better correlation is obtained between tvdi generated using evi and sm compared to tvdi generated using ndvi temporal variation of tvdi with sm shows that tvdi evi almost captures the maximum and minimum sm variation in most locations also sm at 10 40 cm shows a better negative correlation r close to 0 5 with tvdi evi than 0 10 cm depth for the summer season the result thus reveals the potential of tvdi in assessing sm especially in summer season while using evi as the vegetation index keywords temperature vegetation dryness index tvdi soil moisture soil depths correlation ganga basin data availability open source data is used 1 introduction land surface energy exchange and hydrological conditions significantly affect the changes in atmospheric conditions soil moisture sm is considered as the crucial component necessary to control all hydrological and climatological fluxes regulating land atmosphere feedback mechanism guo and dirmeyer 2006 nair and indu 2019 krishnan nair and indu 2021 to provide valuable results for studies such as hydrology meteorology and agriculture it is essential to provide reliable and spatially distributed measurements of sm sabaghy et al 2020 krishnan et al 2021 while sm information is indispensable its widespread and continuous measurement remains challenging it is time consuming and difficult to consistently perform in situ measurements of sm variation of sm depends on many factors such as soil type and land cover so sm variations are difficult to assess by site specific ground observation in addition point measurements are frequently questioned concerning the relevance of regional applications grayson and western 1998 the accuracy of land surface model simulations is often compromised due to errors caused by atmospheric forcing and unawareness on critical variables at desired spatial and temporal scales rodell et al 2004 these shortcomings make remote sensing an attractive alternative for multispectral measurements over spatial and temporal domains patel et al 2008 passive microwave data from l band radiometers especially brightness temperature tb have the capability to provide useful knowledge about sm and land surface emissivity krishnan et al 2019 krishnan et al 2022a b globally passive microwave data are collected by the operational microwave satellites on board l band radiometers dedicated to sm monitoring namely soil moisture and ocean salinity smos kerr et al 2010 and soil moisture active passive smap entekhabi et al 2010 the main limitation remains the coarse resolution around 40 km of the satellite footprint the use of radiometric measurements at visible and infrared wavelengths has been proposed as a way to overcome this problem when crop canopy is

observations are helpful in the field of land ocean and atmosphere aqua 1 km resolution lst product terra aqua 16 day composite evi and ndvi product are exploited to generate tvdi for the present study krishnan et al 2022a b using terra and aqua products an eight day vi is generated in addition to ndvi evi has been utilized because it was optimized for improved vegetation cover response and reduced influence from the soil underneath modis data for the period concerned is obtained from the nasa appeears site https lpdaacsvc cr usgs gov appeears 2 3 methods an overview of the methodology and details are shown in fig 2 and described in the following sections the combined product of terra and aqua products of modis generates an 8 day time series of both ndvi and evi in contrast lst and sm products are available daily therefore the entire data sets used for the present study are transformed to eight day temporal resolution same as vegetation indices 2 3 1 temperature vegetation dryness index tvdi the lst and turbulent energy fluxes are sensitive to sm while land cover types could severely affect the relationship between lst and sm sona et al 2012 tvdi analyzes the vegetation index vi within a region and the variation in lst while under the same vi value and then creates the lst vi feature space through the use of all the vi and lst available scatter plots of lst and vegetation index vi of an area comprising varying sm and vegetation types result in vi lst triangular space the varying evapotranspiration and sm status are represented by pixels within a triangle area by interpreting the vi lst space empirically a simple water stress index called temperature vegetation dryness index was proposed by sandholt et al 2002 it is empirically estimated assuming that i change in lst is mainly due to variation in sm and ii variation in thermal inertia and evapotranspiration affects tvdi sandholt rasmussen and andersen 2002 using tvdi we can determine the moisture status of the soil the highest value indicates dry soil while the lowest value indicates moist soil fig 3 shows the conceptual lst vi triangle space for tvdi calculation lst and the surface turbulent energy fluxes are sensitive and dependent on sm and water fluxes this dependence is modulated by vegetation through the process of transpiration qin et al 2021 extremely low sm can lead to decreased evaporation from soil and decreased rate of transpiration from plants due to less stomatal conductance black et al 1969 damour et al 2010 on the other hand wet soil condition can lead to increased evapotranspiration and thereby decreasing lst due to its cooling effect on soil two physical limits can be observed which represent the maximum and minimum limits of sm and evapotranspiration for various vi classes evapotranspiration is controlled by the lstmax dry edge in the root zone horizontal edge parallel to axis is termed as lstmin which indicates maximum amount of sm and shown as wet edge the tvdi at the dry edge may range from one less sm to zero at the wet edge high sm or saturated meanwhile the left edge parallel to y axis represents the dry to wet bare soil ground surface as it does not affect vegetation mallick et al 2009 holzman et al 2014a b from remotely sensed observations the tvdi is derived as follows 1 tvdi lst lst min lst max lst min lst is the observed land surface temperature in kelvin lstmin is the minimum lst wet edge intercept and lstmax is the maximum lst for a given vi as determined by equation 2 2 lst max a v i b a dry edge intercept and b dry edge slope are dry edge parameters fitted to the data as a linear equation and vi is the vegetation index ndvi or evi that corresponds to the observed lst now the equation 1 can be written as 3 tvdi lst lst min avi b lst min based on extracted values of maximum lst and ndvi values lstmax parameters were estimated for the study period to calculate wet edges lst vi scatter plots were used to average lst points for different vi intervals once the parameters are obtained the tvdi was calculated for each day using equation 3 tvdi was computed using both ndvi and evi to compare the performance of each vi tvdi values ranges from 0 to 1 previous research pham et al 2021 gao gao and chang 2011 wang et al 2004 has categorized tvdi into five classes based on the values obtained classified as very wet for tvdi value between 0 and 0 2 wet for 0 2 0 4 normal for 0 4 0 6 dry for 0 6 0 8 and very dry for 0 8 1 for the present study lst vi plots are created for the years 2017 2018 and 2019 to calculate the minimum lst maximum lst and parameters to calculate tvdi for each pixel the least square linear regression was used to determine dry edge using the maximum temperature and ndvi for small intervals of vi the dry edge parameters were calculated the pearson correlation coefficients r are used to evaluate the tvdi results as shown in equation 4 4 r i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 where represents the tvdi and y represents sm tvdi s applicability to soil moisture monitoring can be assessed by evaluating r s value 3 results and discussion 3 1 lst vi space lst vi plots are created for the years 2017 2018 and 2019 to calculate the minimum lst maximum lst and parameters to calculate tvdi for each pixel due to missing data during the dry season especially around the rivers lakes and irrigated fields these triangles have a concave shape primarily because they occurred in areas where the natural vegetation was least extensive based on the ndvi intervals the lst minimum was calculated as the mean temperature of areas partially covered with vegetation including soil surfaces fig 4 presents the slope and intercept parameters as a function of time for the dry edge during the year 2019 results show that the slope of dry edge 57 for evi and 48 for ndvi in the vi lst space of the summer season was clearer and negative than that of the post monsoon season 14 for evi and 13 for ndvi significant differences in fractional vegetation cover are mainly responsible for these subtle differences slopes and intercepts of the dry edge show a trend corresponding with rainfall patterns the dry edge increases after the summer season and after reaching a peak during monsoon falls in post monsoon season and the slope shows the reverse trends when ndvi and evi are compared ndvi shows a high dry edge intercept while evi shows a high wet edge the evi also indicates a high negative slope trend 3 2 spatial variation of tvdi the spatial pattern of tvdi generated using lst ndvi and lst evi are shown in figs 5 and 6 respectively the spatial pattern of all three seasons summer monsoon and post monsoon have been studied for the years of 2017 2018 and 2019 respectively tvdi values vary spatially and temporally in distinct ways over time the tvdi value of zero represents for wet pixels and one stands for dry pixels compared to monsoon and post monsoon high tvdi values are shown for the summer season spatial plots of monsoon season show that most areas have wet pixels tvdi value close to zero a high tvdi value is observed over the southwest part of the basin that covers hot arid and semi arid regions of the ganga basin the high tvdi values indicate that these areas are drier than the north which is predominantly irrigated the study area s north and northeastern regions have low tvdi ranges associated with higher sm retention capacity and fractional coverage in the region tvdi values were exceptionally low for rivers 0 1 as seen in fig 5 and fig 6 the increased precipitation and vegetation coverage during monsoon results in the lowest tvdi during monsoon every year in contrast high values in summer and post monsoon indicates dry region with less land cover most of the agricultural area will be harvested during this period and can result in dry areas in post monsoon most pixels of the tvdi fall between 0 3 and 0 5 however in the summer season tvdi values shows higher value above 0 5 which can be attributed to the increased lst and dryness comparing figs 5 and 6 it is significant that tvdi values generated using ndvi are higher than evi this can be visible in the southwest part of the study area where tvdi using ndvi shows values in the range of 0 8 compared to 0 6 of tvdi using evi ndvi values are asymptotically saturated in high biomass regions and include background and atmospheric noises shan et al 2013 kyparissis and levizou 2022 in the case of evi atmospheric effects and other noises are reduced resulting in less tvdi value in semi arid and vegetated areas increased vegetation monitoring capacity of evi can also be a factor in low tvdi this was shown in lst vi triangle space fig 3 where increased vegetation results in reduced tvdi thus the sm and its correlations with vegetation are frequently influenced by land use changes zhao et al 2022 2023 spatial variation of tvdi value also shows the topographical variation of the study region where high tvdi values are observed in central plateau and hill agro climatic zone of ganga basin central water commission ministry of water resources and national remote sensing nrsc 2014 with a majority of the land is not used for cultivation on the other hand low tvdi values showing high wetness or sm is shown in the upper and middle gangetic planes both these regions have a high level of cultivation of crops like rice and wheat even in the pre monsoon season summer the spatial value of tvdi is less in this region due to the agricultural practices especially rabi crop cultivation the extreme north part of the study region a part of the western himalayan region shows low tvdi value close to one in all the seasons due to the snow covered area 3 3 relationship between esa cci sm and tvdi correlation coefficient r between sm and tvdi has been derived for three seasons summer monsoon and pre monsoon over three years 2017 2018 and 2019 figs 7 and 8 show the spatial distributions of correlation coefficients between esa cci sm and tvdi with ndvi and evi respectively the relationship between tvdi and sm is considered significant when it is negative whereas the positive correlation is insignificant patel et al 2008 the spatial plot indicates a significant negative correlation between generated tvdi and sm especially tvdi developed using evi shows better correlation compared with the ndvi generated tvdi ndvi values cannot reflect the conditions of the ground that are dry or wet especially when the surface is saturated and has high evapotranspiration also evi proves to be more effective in densely vegetated areas so to some degree tvdi generated using evi and lst compensate for the inadequacy of tvdi based on ndvi and lst data for all regions the correlations between sm and the tvdi from summer season were better than the values determined for post monsoon season one of the notable results was shown in the year 2018 when both simulated tvdis were not significant as low correlation coefficient compared to the years 2017 and 2019 the correlation between the tvdi and sm in summer was in the range of 0 8 0 4 whereas post monsoon had a wide range of 0 8 0 9 under high vegetation cover the tvdi is less sensitive to sm than it would be under normal conditions further the variation of tvdi generated using both ndvi and evi with sm was evaluated for 5 different locations in the ganga basin fig 9 shows the variation of tvdi using ndvi with esa cci sm and fig 10 shows the interpretation of tvdi using evi with esa cci sm for five locations tvdi values plotted against sm show higher sm values correspond to lower tvdi values and vice versa especially for tvdi generated using evi and lst tvdi developed using ndvi could not capture the negative linear variation and trend except for purnia fig 10 e all the locations show a visible negative correlation with tvdi using evi the low correlation in purnia can be attributed to the consistent moist climate in purnia it is also the highest rainfall available place in bihar figs 9 and 10 thus show that evi outperforms the ndvi in capturing the sm variation as explained in the spatial plots 3 4 tvdi and gldas noah lsm sm at different soil layer figs 11 and 12 show the correlation between the sm and the tvdi with ndvi and tvdi with evi for different seasons across the years 2017 2018 and 2019 to explore the applicability of tvdis gldas noah lsm sm available at a depth of 0 10 cm 10 40 cm 40 100 cm and 100 200 cm are used for investigating the capability of tvdi in capturing sub surface sm variability the spatial variation of tvdi shows a considerable variation both over the area and seasonally initial analysis of the figures shows a better correlation of tvdi using evi with sm than tvdi with ndvi evaluating both the figures sm and the tvdi have high negative correlations for the 10 40 cm depth range in the summer season compared to all the other sm depths a distinct positive correlation trend was noticed in the post monsoon season with full crop cover most of the previous studies related to tvdi indicated only a negative correlation of sm with tvdi holzman et al 2014a b patel et al 2008 the region with high tvdi and lst is related to wet soil conditions due to dense vegetation also the region with low tvdi and low lst is related with dry soil due to sparse canopy ryu et al 2021 both the above conditions can lead to a positive correlation of tvdi with sm when vegetation cover is sparse in summer a better correlation is shown between sm and tvdi as the depth of sm increases as a result tvdi explains better the differences in deeper layers during the summer in the ganga basin seasonal differences in tvdi response were primarily due to the difference in lst to diverse vegetation conditions fig 13 shows the mean correlation coefficient of gldas sm at different soil layer depths with tvdi evi and lst 2017 2018 and 2019 analysis has been carried out only for tvdi using evi as spatial analysis shows less correlation coefficient for tvdi using ndvi in the summer season sm at 10 40 cm shows a better negative correlation with r close to 0 5 than 0 10 cm depth in most of the locations similar results are shown by c f chen et al 2011 where tvdi shows a strong negative correlation 0 43 at a depth of 10 20 cm due to the moist humid climate less correlation of tvdi with all the sub surface soil layers is found especially in purnia bihar also purnia is considered as the highest rainfall available place in bihar a distinct positive correlation is shown in all layers in every location during the post monsoon season with a better correlation of tvdi with sm at a 100 200 cm soil depth 4 summary and conclusion in this study the temperature vegetation dryness index tvdi was estimated at a high resolution 1 km to assess sm the study has been conducted over the ganga basin for a period of three years 2017 2018 and 2019 the triangle trapezoid feature space created by lst and vi was used to generate tvdi two different tvdi were developed using both vegetation indices ndvi and evi passive microwave sensor satellite coarse scaled sm product esa cci evaluated the generated tvdi gldas noah lsm sm was used to investigate the correlation between sm at different layers and tvdi tvdi obtained from the triangle space of lst evi was more suitable for sm monitoring than lst ndvi when canopy coverage is sparse tvdi showed a superior correlation with sm for all regions the correlations between sm and the tvdi from the summer season were better than the values determined for post monsoon season one of the notable results was shown in the year 2018 when both simulated tvdis were not significant as low correlation coefficient compared to the years 2017 and 2019 tvdi and sm show a better correlation in summer 0 8 0 4 the poor correlation in post monsoon can be attributed to significant vegetation cover reducing the effect of sm in tvdi during the pre monsoon season tvdi is more effective in monitoring sm at soil layer depths of 10 40 cm than at 0 10 cm a positive correlation of tvdi with sm at different layer depths was found predominantly in the post monsoon season spatial and temporal valuation of tvdi shows that its applicability can be used mainly in the summer and post monsoon season in the basin although this method can be applied at a regional scale to monitor soil moisture diversity in the vegetation and geographic condition and the presence of cloud cover in the data imposes problems despite some limitations tvdi purely based on remote sensing observation can still provide accurate high resolution sm information by downscaling the remote sensing soil moisture products the potential of this technique needs to be explored over areas with different climatical and geographical conditions for extended period of time credit

1897,intensive pumping activities threaten the coast groundwater environment and have a negative impact on aquifer systems a comprehensive understanding of these effects is important for the management of coastal groundwater resources however this is challenging particularly for coastal saline groundwater systems due to complex water rock interactions in this study a coupled variable density flow and hydrochemical reaction model was used to examine the effects of pumping activities on the groundwater environment on the southern coast of laizhou bay china which is a typical muddy coast the model successfully captured the hydrodynamic and hydrochemical changes and the water rock interactions during three different exploitation stages 1 evaporation and water rock interactions were the primary controls on groundwater evolution during the weakly pumped stage before 1995 2 the groundwater level began to decrease and saltwater intrusion was aggravated during the small pumping stage 1995 2005 and 3 significant hydrodynamic and hydrochemical changes occurred at the saline freshwater transition and pumping zones during a period of intensive pumping after 2005 our findings revealed that water rock interactions are the primary drivers of hydrochemical evolution at the saline freshwater transition and seaward saline groundwater zone whereas hydrodynamic changes are the main drivers in the pumping and deep saline brine water zones furthermore we discussed the effects of hydrodynamic variations and water rock interactions on the aquifer matrix and identified that irreversible changes occurred mainly in the pumping zone and saline freshwater transition in conclusion our study highlights the importance of considering both hydrodynamic and hydrogeochemical factors when managing coastal groundwater resources by developing a better understanding of these complex interactions we can minimize the negative impacts of pumping activities and preserve the long term sustainability of coastal groundwater resources keywords reactive transport water rock interaction pumping activities coast groundwater groundwater environment data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction coastal groundwater resources worldwide have been facing unprecedented challenges due to increasing human activities over the last 100 yr cao et al 2013 van pham et al 2019 wu et al 2020 in particular the imbalance between water supply and demand in muddy coastal zone is increasing due to the complex sedimentary environment and intensive human activities jiao and post 2019 at such locations large scale groundwater exploitation has led to negative effects in the groundwater environment and a series of environmental problems such as ground subsidence and groundwater pollution higgins et al 2013 minderhoud et al 2017 phien wej et al 2006 human activities have become the dominant control on the evolution of the groundwater environment shen and wang 2002 zhang 2017 however these effects are uncertain and complex due to the various human activities flaux et al 2013 han et al 2014 han and currell 2022 and sea land interactions wang et al 2020 therefore investigating and predicting the evolution of groundwater environments affected by human activities could guide groundwater management in the coastal zone and is also important for sustainable water resources development and groundwater environmental protection prior to the significant effects of human activities on the groundwater environment most studies have focused on its evolution in its natural state lambrakis 2006 studied the groundwater evolution on the argos plain greece and discovered that cation exchange was the primary controlling factor on groundwater evolution mastrocicco et al 2021 found that water rock interactions were the main controlling factor on the hydrochemical evolution of groundwater in the campania plains italy li et al 2021 analyzed the effects of transgression and regression on groundwater evolution in laizhou bay lzb china due to rapid urbanization and industrialization intensive pumping has resulted in a fall in the groundwater level variations in hydrochemistry and a decrease in water resources han et al 2014 wang et al 2022b weiskel et al 2007 in coastal zones previous studies have focused mainly on qualitative analyses of the groundwater environment evolution using hydrochemical methods dang et al 2022 han et al 2014 li et al 2021 qi et al 2019 and by quantifying changes in the hydrodynamic and hydrochemical fields via numerical simulations cao et al 2020 chang et al 2018 eissa et al 2016 mao et al 2006a these studies all suggest that human activities are the primary cause of the deterioration in coastal groundwater environments however these previous studies have not considered the critical role of feedback mechanisms between water rock interactions and density driven flow in saline groundwater systems water rock interactions change the chemical composition of fluids li et al 2020 mongelli et al 2013 as well as their density hamann et al 2015 lide 2004 post and prommer 2007 therefore when investigating the evolution of groundwater in coastal areas it is important to consider these feedback mechanisms the reactive transport model is a valuable tool for analyzing coupled physical chemical and biological processes in the earth system steefel et al 2005 in particular this approach is essential for accurately describing transport phenomena in saline groundwater systems where both variable density and complex reactive processes must be considered mao et al 2006b the basic theory of reactive transport models was first outlined by lichtner 1985 with a theoretical and numerical basis provided by yeh and tripathi 1989 subsequently the development of the single component solute transport model mt3d zheng 1990 and multi component solute transport model mt3dms zheng and wang 1999 allowed the development of coupled solute transport and chemical reaction models currently three types of reactive transport models have been developed 1 continuum models including rt3d clement 1997 pht3d prommer et al 2003 phwat mao et al 2006b and toughreact xu et al 2011 2 pore scale models including lattice boltzmann kang et al 2002 and pnbrns gharasoo et al 2012 and 3 the hybrid model minc pruess and narasimhan 1985 these models have been widely used to obtain quantitative and hydrochemical information about groundwater processes for example both gomis et al 1996 and boluda botella et al 2008 2014 established a one dimensional reaction transport model based on column experiments to examine the effect of reaction transport parameters on hydrochemical changes during seawater intrusion however a simple one dimensional model does not accurately reflect the complex nature of coastal aquifer therefore two dimensional models were established to account for the hydrochemical processes at the saline freshwater transition freedman and ibaraki 2002 mao et al 2006b with in depth examination and prediction of these systems establishing a model that can depict the characteristics of natural sub surface environment has been recognized as an important topic numerous studies have investigated the effect of calcite dissolution on rock structure in carbonate aquifers by considering both variable density flow and reactive transport processes campana and fidelibus 2015 romanov and dreybrodt 2006 s√°inz garc√≠a et al 2011 v√°squez et al 2013 and hamann et al 2015 simulated the formation of brine due to evaporation by coupling density driven flow and hydrogeochemical processes below playas despite the substantial progress in understanding these reactive processes most reactive transport models have only considered one dimensional theoretical scenarios well controlled laboratory experiments or field examples with simplified geometries due to the complex nature of physicochemical processes in groundwater other reaction processes have also been considered colombani et al 2014 simulated the response processes of 1 2 dichloroethane and dissolved organic carbon during seawater intrusion by coupling seawat and pht3d s√°inz garc√≠a et al 2017 examined the effects of geochemical reactions on carbon storage by coupling comsol and phreeqc uhlmann et al 2017 showed that groundwater in the lusatian lignite mining district is widely affected by pyrite weathering many studies have used the reaction transport models to study the desorption and adsorption processes of arsenic mozumder et al 2020 wallis et al 2011 xie et al 2020 guo et al 2023 evaluated the response processes of dissolved organic carbon and nitrate to river aquifer interactions during managed aquifer recharge to our knowledge there are few studies that have used a multicomponent reactive transport model to assess the responses of coastal groundwater chemistry to pumping activities furthermore although the reaction processes in the mixing zone between saline water and freshwater have been explored there have been few studies of the reaction processes in the mixing zone between multiple types of groundwater in a muddy coastal zone the study focuses on the southern coast of lzb china a typical muddy coastal zone with multiple types of groundwater including freshwater brackish water saline water and brine gao et al 2020 given its unique geographic location geological and environmental evolutionary context it is an ideal site to investigate the significant impact of anthropogenic activities on the groundwater environment the rapid industrialization and population growth in the lzb since the 1970s have led to a significant increase in the demand for groundwater resources in recent decades the large scale extraction of groundwater for industrial agricultural and domestic water purposes has caused dramatic changes in the groundwater level leading to the salinization of fresh groundwater and a decrease in brine concentration since xue et al 1997 2000 identified the exploitation of freshwater or brine as the primary cause of saltwater intrusion in the lzb numerous studies have examined the evolution of saline groundwater and seawater intrusion processes using various methods such as hydrochemical analyses han et al 2014 qi et al 2019 isotope analyses du et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 and numerical simulations han et al 2020 li et al 2021 from the achievements made in the study area numerous data have been acquired on the evolution of groundwater salinization but several critical questions remain unanswered specifically it is unclear whether the physical structure and chemical composition of the aquifer matrix undergo significant changes due to pumping activities and the drivers of the hydrochemical evolution of different groundwater types are still unknown in this study we focused mainly on analyzing the response of coastal groundwater hydrodynamics and hydrochemistry to pumping activities by coupling models of variable density flow and hydrogeochemical reactions with the aim of establishing a coupled multi interface hydrogeochemical model this model could then be used to examine the circulation and migration of water and salt in the seawater groundwater sediment system the specific objectives of this study are to 1 investigate the dynamic changes in hydrodynamic and hydrochemical processes in a coastal groundwater system due to pumping activities 2 assess the contributions of hydrodynamic conditions and water rock interactions to groundwater hydrochemistry 3 identify the effects of groundwater extraction on the aquifer matrix our results provide a basis for groundwater exploitation in muddy coastal zones worldwide 2 study area the study area is located on the southern coast of lzb in northern shandong province china fig 1 a the annual average evaporation is 1650 mm which is approximately two times greater than the annual average precipitation of 730 mm of the study area han et al 2014 from south to north the sediments change from gravelly sand to coarse sand clayey sand and sandy clay and to sandy clay with intermittent clay lenses fig 1b three aquifers formed by marine sediments in this region are the holocene late pleistocene and early pleistocene aquifers which correspond to three transgressive and regressive events that have occurred along the southern coast of lzb since the late pleistocene gao et al 2020 the groundwater chemical types are freshwater fw dominated by hco3 na mg and hco3 cl mg ca brackish water bw dominated by cl hco3 na hco3 cl na mg and so4 ca mg and saline water sw and brine b dominated by cl na mg and cl na han et al 2014 groundwater at depths of 30 m is categorized as deep groundwater while groundwater at depths of 30 m is referred to as shallow groundwater the groundwater exploitation history in the lzb can be classified into two stages for freshwater and three stages for brine for freshwater exploitation 1 from the 1990s to the 2000s the freshwater level began to decline and 2 after the 2000s groundwater exploitation became relatively stable as a result of implementation of groundwater management policies liu 2018 sun 2019 for brine exploitation 1 before 1995 the initial exploitation stage with a low pumping rate 2 during 1995 2005 a small scale exploitation stage the groundwater level began to decrease 3 after 2005 due to the increase of market demand over exploitation of brine resources led to a further decrease in brine water level guan 2009 fig 2 based on these observations the evolution of groundwater in the lzb was divided into three stages the early weak pumping stage wp before 1995 the small pumping stage sp 1995 2005 and intensive pumping stage ip 2005 2015 3 methodology 3 1 model set up and discretization and initial and boundary conditions to reduce the significant computational demand of the fully three dimensional set up vertical cross sections a a along the middle and lower reaches of the bailang river in the lzb were selected to establish a two dimensional model fig 3 the model was discretized into 501 columns and 55 layers of rectangular mesh with 21 079 active meshes the horizontal size of the grid was set to 100 m vertical size of grid was set to 1 m the horizontal dispersion refers to a previous result of Œ±l 500 m chang et al 2018 and thus the accuracy of the grid meets the requirements of peclet s criterion zheng and bennett 2002 the southern side boundary was set as a specific head boundary with a concentration boundary because the lateral flow on the southern border recharges the aquifer the water level and concentrations of different species were based on the results table s1 of freshwater monitoring from previous studies zhang et al 1996 1997 the northern boundary of the model extended 1 2 km from the coastline towards the shallow sea the top surface of the shallow sea was set as the specific head boundary with a constant concentration based on the seawater composition table s1 the upper boundary was based on precipitation and evaporation data during 1992 2015 collected from weifang water affairs bureau fig s1 the remaining boundaries were set as no flow boundaries the time varying datasets including groundwater levels from 1992 to 2015 fig 2 were used for model calibration as well as the measured groundwater level and chemistry data from monitoring wells along the cross sections in 2015 table s1 the 23 yr transition simulation was set to 23 stress periods based on annually averaged precipitation and evaporation data the initial water level and major ion concentrations were determined based on data from previous studies zhang et al 1996 1997 the pumping of freshwater and brine were simulated by setting pumping wells and the pumping rates were determined by calibration with the groundwater level 3 2 numerical modeling framework the present model simulated the hydrochemical response of coastal groundwater under different pumping stages by coupling the variable density multicomponent solute transport model seawat 2000 langevin et al 2008 and the hydrogeochemical model phreeqc 2 parkhurst and appelo 2013 the fluid mass balance equation solved by seawat 2000 is langevin et al 2008 1 n œÅ t œÅ q œÅ q s where is the gradient operator œÅ is the fluid density ml 3 n is the porosity œÅ is the density of water entering from recharge or leaving through evaporation ml 3 q s is a source or sink t 1 of fluid with

using phreeqc 2 parkhurst and appelo 2013 since all of the reactions were assumed to be in equilibrium each reaction depends on an equilibrium constant multi component solute transport was simulated using the mt3dms sub package in the seawat framework zheng and wang 1999 in this simulation the major ions of k na ca2 mg2 cl so4 2 and hco3 were selected as solutes after the completion of the mt3dms simulation the phreeqc 2 geochemical speciation reaction package was employed to simulate cation exchange and mineral dissolution precipitation processes given that these reactions are time dependent prior knowledge of their kinetic parameters is required however as these parameters are currently unknown it was assumed that all of these reactions occur in equilibrium 3 3 geochemical reaction network the reaction network in this study consists mainly of cation exchange mineral dissolution precipitation and gas phase equilibrium for co2 and assumes local equilibrium further details of the reaction network are provided in text s1 the modeled mineral phases include calcite dolomite gypsum sylvite and halite which were selected based on the results of guo 2016 given that the strata are dominated by low solubility minerals such as illite 50 60 vol guo 2016 and it is difficult to obtain the content of dissolved salts and their distribution we mainly considered the mineral precipitation reactions the initial amount of minerals in the model domain was set to zero we assumed complete exchange and equilibrium of dissolved atmospheric and groundwater co2 at the water table bauer gottwein et al 2007 sanford and wood 1991 although this assumption is not always correct the aquifer in the lzb is mainly sandy and muddy unlike a karst aquifer where carbonate dissolution precipitation has a greater effect on the aquifer campana and fidelibus 2015 s√°inz garc√≠a et al 2011 therefore the top boundary of the model was assumed to be in constant equilibrium with atmospheric co2 pco2 10 3 5 atm which assumes that calcite and co2 remain in equilibrium kohfahl et al 2008 3 4 parameter settings and result calculations the hydraulic conductivity specific yield or specific storage of the aquifer and dispersion and molecular diffusion coefficients were based on previous results chang et al 2018 han et al 2011 liu 2018 cation exchange in groundwater is highly dependent on the cation exchange capacity cec of the aquifer media appelo and postma 2004 chen and jiao 2014 the cec of clay in the study area was set with reference to previous studies wu et al 1996a wu et al 1996b while the cec of sandy media was based on the study of zheng et al 2009 the final calibration parameters are presented in table 1 and fig 4 the concentration changes of major ions were calculated from the concentration ct in year t minus the concentration ct 1 in year t 1 i e ct ct 1 the cation exchange process at different stages was analyzed by calculating changes in the percentage of cation contents k x na x ca x and mg x in the exchanger i e cation content in year t minus the cation content in year t 1 4 results 4 1 model calibration aquifer hydraulic conductivity dispersion molecular diffusion coefficient and cation exchange capacity were calibrated by trial and error methods based on the monitoring results the calibration results were presented figs 5 6 the average residuals between the measured and calculated values of each major ion k na ca2 mg2 cl and so4 2 were 4 77 mg l 382 56 mg l 47 15 mg l 11 07 mg l 359 58 mg l and 11 91 mg l with correlation coefficients of 0 991 0 996 0 952 0 984 0 991 and 0 970 respectively in general the fitting errors of most ions were small but the results of hco3 concentration showed a large deviation for some points mainly because of the substantial variation in the pressure of co2 in groundwater mahlknecht et al 2017 the final calibration parameters in our model are presented in fig 4 and table 1 4 2 groundwater response to different exploitation periods the changes in the groundwater flow fields and major ion concentrations at different exploitation stages are shown in figs 7 8 we describe the responses based on different water quality regions for the freshwater brackish water region l 0 16 km there is no significant groundwater drawdown due to the weak pumping and groundwater flowing horizontally during the wp stage fig 8a after entering the sp stage the groundwater level began to decrease i e a maximum decrease of 16 m fig 8b and a groundwater depression l 8 13 km formed in the freshwater pumping zone when over exploitation began the ip stage the extend of the freshwater depression expanded l 1 21 km and groundwater still flowed horizontally but the velocity became larger than in the first two stages in terms of the hydrochemical response the major ions changed significantly only near the brackish water region where saltwater intrusion occurred from the wp to ip stages in the deep brackish water ca2 and mg2 decreased in the wp stage and then increased in the sp and ip stages whereas na showed a different trend this is mainly caused by saltwater intrusion which leads to the displacement of ca2 and mg2 by na for the saline water region l 16 32 km the groundwater flow was largely vertical during the wp stage fig 8a while the hydrodynamic field changed during the sp stage resulting in the formation of a groundwater divide gd l 17 km to the right of the freshwater pumping zone the groundwater on the left side of the gd flowed towards the freshwater depression and there was no significant change on the right side of the gd as compared with the wp stage fig 8b after entering the ip stage the gd moved to the right by l 24 km due to over exploitation the major ion concentrations except for hco3 and so4 2 in the shallow groundwater increased by variable degrees from the wp to ip stages due to evaporation the increases in na and cl were the most significant the maximum increases in na and cl were 740 and 1256 mg l respectively whereas the decreases in so4 2 and hco3 were due to water rock reactions for the deep groundwater there were no uniform changes in the major ions during the wp stage with increased exploitation from the sp to ip stages the concentration of each ion except for hco3 increased at the top z 30 to 50 m whereas the hypersaline water at the bottom z 50 to 90 m exhibited a trend of decreasing concentrations for the brine region l 32 42 km the groundwater level dropped abruptly due to brine extraction from the wp to ip stages and a groundwater depression l 33 40 km formed in the brine extraction zone during the sp stage the extent of the depression expanded l 28 43 km during the ip stage the concentration of shallow brine increased during the wp stage due to evaporation and the concentration decreased at the top of the deep groundwater z 30 to 70 m but increased at the bottom z 70 to 90 m during the sp stage the shallow brine concentration increased as a result of the accumulation of downward transported saline water around the margins of the depression however the deep brine concentration decreased significantly because of the pumping activities when over exploitation occurred i e the ip stage the brine concentration decreased dramatically with a maximum decrease in cl of 13 6 g l for the seaward saline water region l 42 50 km the hydrodynamic conditions did not change significantly from the wp to ip stages the hydrochemical response in this region was similar during the three pumping stages with the major ion concentrations in the upper region z 0 to 50 m increasing due to seawater intrusion whereas the hypersaline water at the bottom of this region z 50 to 90 m was diluted by seawater this suggests that seawater intrusion also has a role in reducing the groundwater salinity sun et al 2023 for example the evaporation induced salinity of intertidal groundwater is two times higher than that of seawater and thus the low concentration seawater acts as a dilutant geng et al 2016 4 3 hydrochemical processes in the different pumping stages the responses of the cations na ca2 and mg2 differ from those of the conservative ion cl because these ions are involved in water rock interactions therefore it is necessary to further explore the hydrochemical reactions between the aquifer matrix and groundwater 4 3 1 cation exchange given that k is mainly involved in chemisorption processes li et al 2013 zheng et al 2009 the changes in k x are limited fig 9 a c therefore we focused on the exchange between na ca2 and mg2 for the freshwater region l 0 10 km ca x and mg x exhibit inverse variations from the wp to ip stages indicative of ca2 and mg2 exchange given the main type of freshwater hydrochemistry is hco3 cl mg ca sun et al 2023 ca2 and mg2 exchange is driven by the affinity between water and the aquifer matrix with the affinity being ca2 mg2 na mart√≠nez and bocanegra 2002 for the brackish water region l 10 16 km na x and mg x increased but ca x decreased during the wp stage because saltwater intrusion results in an exchange between na and mg2 in saline water and ca2 in clay appelo and postma 2004 gim√©nez forcada 2014 after groundwater extraction was intensified the extent of replacement of ca2 by na in the shallow groundwater increased from the sp to ip stages whereas the deep brackish water underwent cation exchange of desalination processes after the direction of groundwater flow was reversed for the saline water region l 16 32 km the changes in cation contents near the brackish water region l 16 20 km were similar to those of the brackish water region the changes in na x were opposite to those of ca x and mg x during the three stages and na x increased and ca x and mg x decreased in the shallow groundwater while the changes in the deep groundwater were opposite to those in the shallow groundwater for the brine region l 32 42 km na x increased and ca x and mg x decreased in the shallow groundwater from the wp to sp stages following the decrease in the groundwater level ip stage the upper region of the deep brine had an increase in na x and a decrease in ca x and mg x whereas the bottom brine had a decrease in na x and an increase in ca x and mg x for the seaward saline water region l 42 50 km there was an obvious exchange between na and mg2 in groundwater with ca2 in clay due to seawater intrusion during the three stages 4 3 2 mineral dissolution and precipitation the distribution of calcite precipitation from the wp to ip stages fig 10 shows that the saline freshwater transition and brine seawater regions are the main calcite precipitation regions moreover the calcite content is higher maximum of 12 5 mol m3 in the transition zone and saline water region l 10 18 km than in the brine seawater region this is consistent with the results of xue et al 1997 who examined seawater saltwater intrusion into the lzb from the perspective of hydrochemistry and found that calcite precipitation occurred in the saline freshwater transition zone this process has been described in many other coastal zones and brine bearing groundwater systems worldwide for example wicks et al 1995 verified the hypothesis that the transition zone is a chemically active environment for carbonate mineral diagenesis by examining the groundwater chemical evolution in a carbonate aquifer in florida usa v√°squez et al 2013 simulated mineral precipitation in a brine bearing groundwater system in a playa evaporative basin chile and showed that calcite precipitation is highest in the saline freshwater transition zone in addition calcite precipitation occurs in the saline groundwater zone between brine and seawater and the extent of precipitation increases with increased seawater intrusion this is mainly due to seawater intrusion exacerbated by brine extraction and carbonate precipitation may occur in areas affected by seawater intrusion de montety et al 2008 5 discussion 5 1 contribution of driving factors to hydrochemical changes our results show that changes in the hydrodynamic field and water rock interactions can affect the groundwater hydrochemistry in summary this coastal groundwater system is in a natural evolutionary phase during the wp stage when hydrodynamic changes are caused by density gradients similar dynamic processes have been observed in brine bearing groundwater systems in evaporative basins hamann et al 2015 v√°squez et al 2013 and salt lake groundwater systems yager et al 2007 after over exploitation a complex hydrodynamic field formed and a gd hindered the migration of brine or saline waters across the gd to the freshwater zone which made the path and rate of saltwater intrusion more complex than those of modern seawater intrusion given the complex processes that affect coastal groundwaters the main controlling factors on hydrochemical changes need to be further identified therefore we assessed the contributions of changes in groundwater hydrodynamic field and water rock interactions to changes in groundwater hydrochemistry to quantify these contributions in the simulation for the period 1992 2015 we employed a regression method wang et al 2022a wu et al 2020 and used changes in groundwater level cation contents na x in the exchanger and calcite content as predictor variables using the following equation 3 y a 1 x 1 a 2 x 2 a 3 x 3 b where y is the standardized groundwater tds concentration and xi is the standardized groundwater level cation content and calcite content changes for each cell ai i 1 2 3 and b are the regression coefficients and intercept respectively the contributions were calculated with regression coefficients between 0 and 1 as follows 4 contr i a i i 1 3 a i the results fig 11 show that the driving mechanisms of groundwater hydrochemical changes due to pumping activities are complex but can be divided into five regions as follows 1 freshwater zone exchange of ca2 and mg2 is the primary control on groundwater hydrochemical changes outside the depression whereas hydrodynamic changes and cation exchange are the main drivers in the vicinity of the freshwater pumping zone 2 saline fresh water transition zone complex hydrochemical processes occur in this zone and shallow groundwater is controlled by cation exchange while deep groundwater is primarily affected by the dissolution and precipitation of carbonates 3 saline brine water zone although this zone is far from the pumping site the intensive pumping has changed the groundwater hydrodynamic field therefore the main driving factor in the deep groundwater is hydrodynamic change while mineral precipitation is the main driver in the shallow groundwater 4 brine pumping zone like the freshwater pumping zone large fluctuations in groundwater level are caused by the pumping activities in addition hydrochemical reactions occur during the transport of surrounding groundwater to the center of the brine depression therefore the driving mechanism in shallow groundwater include changes in the hydrodynamic conditions and water rock interactions whereas cation exchange and mineral precipitation are the main driving factors in deep groundwater 5 seaward saline water zone this zone is mainly affected by seawater intrusion although cation exchange also occurs in this zone the effects of mineral precipitation are the main control 5 2 effects of groundwater extraction on the aquifer matrix 5 2 1 effects of mineral precipitation on aquifer porosity and permeability when the permeability of an aquifer changes due to mineral reactions groundwater flow is affected which in turn affects water rock interactions campana and fidelibus 2015 post and prommer 2007 therefore there is a feedback between groundwater and aquifer media the relationship between aquifer porosity and the molar volume of mineral species is as follows v√°squez et al 2013 5 n t 1 n t n t i minerals m o l a r v o l i precipitatedquantityofi 0 d i s s o l v e d q u a n t i t y o f i 0 where n t is the porosity at time t and molar vol is the values adopted for the molar volume which for calcite is 3 7 10 5 m3 mol clauser and bartels 2003 the variations in aquifer permeability caused by water rock interactions were calculated based on the carman kozeny equation pape et al 2000 6 k k 0 n n 0 df where k 0 is the permeability of the reference state lt 1 it was assumed that the exponent df is 4 based on these equations we calculated the changes in permeability calcite precipitation was highest in the saline freshwater transition zone up to 12 5 mol m3 converted according to the density of water of 1 g cm3 the maximum changes in porosity and permeability were 0 9995 and 0 9981 times the original values respectively however for a karst aquifer the dissolution of calcite can cause a maximum change in aquifer porosity of 0 85 times the original values s√°inz garc√≠a et al 2011 therefore the dissolution and precipitation of minerals in a muddy coastal zone have little effect on the spatial structure of the aquifer 5 2 2 irreversible effects on the aquifer matrix any process that alters the structure and chemical composition of a porous medium may affect the aquifer matrix processes that cause long term stable and persistent transformations in the subsurface environment are defined as being irreversible yaron et al 2008 yaron et al 2010 the previous section discussed the effects of carbonate precipitation on the permeability of the medium but the changes in the groundwater hydrodynamics and cation exchange processes are also not negligible we assessed the effects of these factors on the aquifer matrix over exploitation of groundwater causes a widespread decrease in water levels which can trigger land subsidence as has been reported for many muddy coastal zones worldwide higgins et al 2013 minderhoud et al 2017 this is because fluctuations in groundwater level can change the effective stresses of the aquifer matrix resulting in compaction or swelling of sediments in the aquifer hughes et al 2022 unfortunately this process is usually irreversible ojha et al 2018 therefore the aquifer matrix will undergo irreversible changes in areas where the hydrodynamic changes are dominant such as the freshwater and brine pumping zones in particular for the brine pumping zone in the present study the groundwater table fell by 40 m due to over exploitation which would cause serious damage to aquifer hydrological properties of aquifer media may change due to the dissolution precipitation of minerals fine particle release and capture and clay swelling saripalli et al 2001 previous studies have concluded that the changes of the spatial configuration of the matrix of the porous medium as a result of clay particle migration are irreversible goldenberg et al 1983 konikow et al 2001 yaron et al 2010 dissolution precipitation of minerals in the aquifer matrix has similar effects on a porous medium luquot and gouze 2009 sonkamble 2012 for example rezaei et al 2005 suggested that dissolution precipitation of calcite in the transition zone between saline water and freshwater would change the structure of the porous medium and consequently the aquifer permeability niu and zhang 2019 confirmed this result using a pore scale numerical approach therefore based on our results calcite that precipitates in the saline fresh water transition zone and on its seaward side would also variably change the pore structure of the porous media leading to irreversible changes in the permeability of the aquifer another process that affects the aquifer matrix is cation exchange which changes the cation composition of clays in the sediment parkhurst and appelo 2013 post and prommer 2007 although numerous studies have suggested that the direction of cation exchange would be reversed when the groundwater flow direction is reversed andersen et al 2005 capuano and jones 2020 prusty and farooq 2021 it is difficult to fully return to the previous state based on our results a change in groundwater flow direction leads to deep brackish saline waters undergoing cation exchange in freshening and salinizing conditions as such the changes relating to cation exchange are also irreversible in summary the effects of human activities on aquifers in muddy coastal zones are mainly the irreversible damage to the aquifer matrix caused by a decrease in the groundwater level after over exploitation although mineral dissolution precipitation reactions can also damage the spatial structure of porous media their effects on an aquifer in muddy coastal zones are much less than those on carbonate aquifers therefore when developing strategies for groundwater management in such areas priority should be given to the control of groundwater levels 6 conclusions a reactive transport model was developed to investigate the hydrochemical processes in groundwater for a muddy coastal zone affected by pumping activities the findings of this study highlight the complex evolution of groundwater in such areas due to various driving mechanisms including hydrodynamic conditions and water rock interactions the simulation results indicate that the hydrodynamic and hydrochemical responses to pumping activity exhibit spatial variability after intensive groundwater extraction the natural equilibrium conditions were perturbed and hydrodynamic changes were dominant factor in the area where the groundwater level decreased and the flow direction changed furthermore water rock interactions were found to have a significant effect on the saline fresh water transition zone although the saline fresh water transition zone is a chemically active environment for carbonate mineral diagenesis the minerals reactions in a muddy coastal zone have less effect on the spatial structure of an aquifer as compared with karst regions our results suggest that groundwater drawdown caused by over exploitation may cause irreversible damage to the groundwater environment in muddy coastal zones therefore control of groundwater levels should be a priority in the groundwater management strategy such areas credit authorship contribution statement qiming sun writing original draft maosheng gao writing review editing

1897,intensive pumping activities threaten the coast groundwater environment and have a negative impact on aquifer systems a comprehensive understanding of these effects is important for the management of coastal groundwater resources however this is challenging particularly for coastal saline groundwater systems due to complex water rock interactions in this study a coupled variable density flow and hydrochemical reaction model was used to examine the effects of pumping activities on the groundwater environment on the southern coast of laizhou bay china which is a typical muddy coast the model successfully captured the hydrodynamic and hydrochemical changes and the water rock interactions during three different exploitation stages 1 evaporation and water rock interactions were the primary controls on groundwater evolution during the weakly pumped stage before 1995 2 the groundwater level began to decrease and saltwater intrusion was aggravated during the small pumping stage 1995 2005 and 3 significant hydrodynamic and hydrochemical changes occurred at the saline freshwater transition and pumping zones during a period of intensive pumping after 2005 our findings revealed that water rock interactions are the primary drivers of hydrochemical evolution at the saline freshwater transition and seaward saline groundwater zone whereas hydrodynamic changes are the main drivers in the pumping and deep saline brine water zones furthermore we discussed the effects of hydrodynamic variations and water rock interactions on the aquifer matrix and identified that irreversible changes occurred mainly in the pumping zone and saline freshwater transition in conclusion our study highlights the importance of considering both hydrodynamic and hydrogeochemical factors when managing coastal groundwater resources by developing a better understanding of these complex interactions we can minimize the negative impacts of pumping activities and preserve the long term sustainability of coastal groundwater resources keywords reactive transport water rock interaction pumping activities coast groundwater groundwater environment data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction coastal groundwater resources worldwide have been facing unprecedented challenges due to increasing human activities over the last 100 yr cao et al 2013 van pham et al 2019 wu et al 2020 in particular the imbalance between water supply and demand in muddy coastal zone is increasing due to the complex sedimentary environment and intensive human activities jiao and post 2019 at such locations large scale groundwater exploitation has led to negative effects in the groundwater environment and a series of environmental problems such as ground subsidence and groundwater pollution higgins et al 2013 minderhoud et al 2017 phien wej et al 2006 human activities have become the dominant control on the evolution of the groundwater environment shen and wang 2002 zhang 2017 however these effects are uncertain and complex due to the various human activities flaux et al 2013 han et al 2014 han and currell 2022 and sea land interactions wang et al 2020 therefore investigating and predicting the evolution of groundwater environments affected by human activities could guide groundwater management in the coastal zone and is also important for sustainable water resources development and groundwater environmental protection prior to the significant effects of human activities on the groundwater environment most studies have focused on its evolution in its natural state lambrakis 2006 studied the groundwater evolution on the argos plain greece and discovered that cation exchange was the primary controlling factor on groundwater evolution mastrocicco et al 2021 found that water rock interactions were the main controlling factor on the hydrochemical evolution of groundwater in the campania plains italy li et al 2021 analyzed the effects of transgression and regression on groundwater evolution in laizhou bay lzb china due to rapid urbanization and industrialization intensive pumping has resulted in a fall in the groundwater level variations in hydrochemistry and a decrease in water resources han et al 2014 wang et al 2022b weiskel et al 2007 in coastal zones previous studies have focused mainly on qualitative analyses of the groundwater environment evolution using hydrochemical methods dang et al 2022 han et al 2014 li et al 2021 qi et al 2019 and by quantifying changes in the hydrodynamic and hydrochemical fields via numerical simulations cao et al 2020 chang et al 2018 eissa et al 2016 mao et al 2006a these studies all suggest that human activities are the primary cause of the deterioration in coastal groundwater environments however these previous studies have not considered the critical role of feedback mechanisms between water rock interactions and density driven flow in saline groundwater systems water rock interactions change the chemical composition of fluids li et al 2020 mongelli et al 2013 as well as their density hamann et al 2015 lide 2004 post and prommer 2007 therefore when investigating the evolution of groundwater in coastal areas it is important to consider these feedback mechanisms the reactive transport model is a valuable tool for analyzing coupled physical chemical and biological processes in the earth system steefel et al 2005 in particular this approach is essential for accurately describing transport phenomena in saline groundwater systems where both variable density and complex reactive processes must be considered mao et al 2006b the basic theory of reactive transport models was first outlined by lichtner 1985 with a theoretical and numerical basis provided by yeh and tripathi 1989 subsequently the development of the single component solute transport model mt3d zheng 1990 and multi component solute transport model mt3dms zheng and wang 1999 allowed the development of coupled solute transport and chemical reaction models currently three types of reactive transport models have been developed 1 continuum models including rt3d clement 1997 pht3d prommer et al 2003 phwat mao et al 2006b and toughreact xu et al 2011 2 pore scale models including lattice boltzmann kang et al 2002 and pnbrns gharasoo et al 2012 and 3 the hybrid model minc pruess and narasimhan 1985 these models have been widely used to obtain quantitative and hydrochemical information about groundwater processes for example both gomis et al 1996 and boluda botella et al 2008 2014 established a one dimensional reaction transport model based on column experiments to examine the effect of reaction transport parameters on hydrochemical changes during seawater intrusion however a simple one dimensional model does not accurately reflect the complex nature of coastal aquifer therefore two dimensional models were established to account for the hydrochemical processes at the saline freshwater transition freedman and ibaraki 2002 mao et al 2006b with in depth examination and prediction of these systems establishing a model that can depict the characteristics of natural sub surface environment has been recognized as an important topic numerous studies have investigated the effect of calcite dissolution on rock structure in carbonate aquifers by considering both variable density flow and reactive transport processes campana and fidelibus 2015 romanov and dreybrodt 2006 s√°inz garc√≠a et al 2011 v√°squez et al 2013 and hamann et al 2015 simulated the formation of brine due to evaporation by coupling density driven flow and hydrogeochemical processes below playas despite the substantial progress in understanding these reactive processes most reactive transport models have only considered one dimensional theoretical scenarios well controlled laboratory experiments or field examples with simplified geometries due to the complex nature of physicochemical processes in groundwater other reaction processes have also been considered colombani et al 2014 simulated the response processes of 1 2 dichloroethane and dissolved organic carbon during seawater intrusion by coupling seawat and pht3d s√°inz garc√≠a et al 2017 examined the effects of geochemical reactions on carbon storage by coupling comsol and phreeqc uhlmann et al 2017 showed that groundwater in the lusatian lignite mining district is widely affected by pyrite weathering many studies have used the reaction transport models to study the desorption and adsorption processes of arsenic mozumder et al 2020 wallis et al 2011 xie et al 2020 guo et al 2023 evaluated the response processes of dissolved organic carbon and nitrate to river aquifer interactions during managed aquifer recharge to our knowledge there are few studies that have used a multicomponent reactive transport model to assess the responses of coastal groundwater chemistry to pumping activities furthermore although the reaction processes in the mixing zone between saline water and freshwater have been explored there have been few studies of the reaction processes in the mixing zone between multiple types of groundwater in a muddy coastal zone the study focuses on the southern coast of lzb china a typical muddy coastal zone with multiple types of groundwater including freshwater brackish water saline water and brine gao et al 2020 given its unique geographic location geological and environmental evolutionary context it is an ideal site to investigate the significant impact of anthropogenic activities on the groundwater environment the rapid industrialization and population growth in the lzb since the 1970s have led to a significant increase in the demand for groundwater resources in recent decades the large scale extraction of groundwater for industrial agricultural and domestic water purposes has caused dramatic changes in the groundwater level leading to the salinization of fresh groundwater and a decrease in brine concentration since xue et al 1997 2000 identified the exploitation of freshwater or brine as the primary cause of saltwater intrusion in the lzb numerous studies have examined the evolution of saline groundwater and seawater intrusion processes using various methods such as hydrochemical analyses han et al 2014 qi et al 2019 isotope analyses du et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 and numerical simulations han et al 2020 li et al 2021 from the achievements made in the study area numerous data have been acquired on the evolution of groundwater salinization but several critical questions remain unanswered specifically it is unclear whether the physical structure and chemical composition of the aquifer matrix undergo significant changes due to pumping activities and the drivers of the hydrochemical evolution of different groundwater types are still unknown in this study we focused mainly on analyzing the response of coastal groundwater hydrodynamics and hydrochemistry to pumping activities by coupling models of variable density flow and hydrogeochemical reactions with the aim of establishing a coupled multi interface hydrogeochemical model this model could then be used to examine the circulation and migration of water and salt in the seawater groundwater sediment system the specific objectives of this study are to 1 investigate the dynamic changes in hydrodynamic and hydrochemical processes in a coastal groundwater system due to pumping activities 2 assess the contributions of hydrodynamic conditions and water rock interactions to groundwater hydrochemistry 3 identify the effects of groundwater extraction on the aquifer matrix our results provide a basis for groundwater exploitation in muddy coastal zones worldwide 2 study area the study area is located on the southern coast of lzb in northern shandong province china fig 1 a the annual average evaporation is 1650 mm which is approximately two times greater than the annual average precipitation of 730 mm of the study area han et al 2014 from south to north the sediments change from gravelly sand to coarse sand clayey sand and sandy clay and to sandy clay with intermittent clay lenses fig 1b three aquifers formed by marine sediments in this region are the holocene late pleistocene and early pleistocene aquifers which correspond to three transgressive and regressive events that have occurred along the southern coast of lzb since the late pleistocene gao et al 2020 the groundwater chemical types are freshwater fw dominated by hco3 na mg and hco3 cl mg ca brackish water bw dominated by cl hco3 na hco3 cl na mg and so4 ca mg and saline water sw and brine b dominated by cl na mg and cl na han et al 2014 groundwater at depths of 30 m is categorized as deep groundwater while groundwater at depths of 30 m is referred to as shallow groundwater the groundwater exploitation history in the lzb can be classified into two stages for freshwater and three stages for brine for freshwater exploitation 1 from the 1990s to the 2000s the freshwater level began to decline and 2 after the 2000s groundwater exploitation became relatively stable as a result of implementation of groundwater management policies liu 2018 sun 2019 for brine exploitation 1 before 1995 the initial exploitation stage with a low pumping rate 2 during 1995 2005 a small scale exploitation stage the groundwater level began to decrease 3 after 2005 due to the increase of market demand over exploitation of brine resources led to a further decrease in brine water level guan 2009 fig 2 based on these observations the evolution of groundwater in the lzb was divided into three stages the early weak pumping stage wp before 1995 the small pumping stage sp 1995 2005 and intensive pumping stage ip 2005 2015 3 methodology 3 1 model set up and discretization and initial and boundary conditions to reduce the significant computational demand of the fully three dimensional set up vertical cross sections a a along the middle and lower reaches of the bailang river in the lzb were selected to establish a two dimensional model fig 3 the model was discretized into 501 columns and 55 layers of rectangular mesh with 21 079 active meshes the horizontal size of the grid was set to 100 m vertical size of grid was set to 1 m the horizontal dispersion refers to a previous result of Œ±l 500 m chang et al 2018 and thus the accuracy of the grid meets the requirements of peclet s criterion zheng and bennett 2002 the southern side boundary was set as a specific head boundary with a concentration boundary because the lateral flow on the southern border recharges the aquifer the water level and concentrations of different species were based on the results table s1 of freshwater monitoring from previous studies zhang et al 1996 1997 the northern boundary of the model extended 1 2 km from the coastline towards the shallow sea the top surface of the shallow sea was set as the specific head boundary with a constant concentration based on the seawater composition table s1 the upper boundary was based on precipitation and evaporation data during 1992 2015 collected from weifang water affairs bureau fig s1 the remaining boundaries were set as no flow boundaries the time varying datasets including groundwater levels from 1992 to 2015 fig 2 were used for model calibration as well as the measured groundwater level and chemistry data from monitoring wells along the cross sections in 2015 table s1 the 23 yr transition simulation was set to 23 stress periods based on annually averaged precipitation and evaporation data the initial water level and major ion concentrations were determined based on data from previous studies zhang et al 1996 1997 the pumping of freshwater and brine were simulated by setting pumping wells and the pumping rates were determined by calibration with the groundwater level 3 2 numerical modeling

using phreeqc 2 parkhurst and appelo 2013 since all of the reactions were assumed to be in equilibrium each reaction depends on an equilibrium constant multi component solute transport was simulated using the mt3dms sub package in the seawat framework zheng and wang 1999 in this simulation the major ions of k na ca2 mg2 cl so4 2 and hco3 were selected as solutes after the completion of the mt3dms simulation the phreeqc 2 geochemical speciation reaction package was employed to simulate cation exchange and mineral dissolution precipitation processes given that these reactions are time dependent prior knowledge of their kinetic parameters is required however as these parameters are currently unknown it was assumed that all of these reactions occur in equilibrium 3 3 geochemical reaction network the reaction network in this study consists mainly of cation exchange mineral dissolution precipitation and gas phase equilibrium for co2 and assumes local equilibrium further details of the reaction network are provided in text s1 the modeled mineral phases include calcite dolomite gypsum sylvite and halite which were selected based on the results of guo 2016 given that the strata are dominated by low solubility minerals such as illite 50 60 vol guo 2016 and it is difficult to obtain the content of dissolved salts and their distribution we mainly considered the mineral precipitation reactions the initial amount of minerals in the model domain was set to zero we assumed complete exchange and equilibrium of dissolved atmospheric and groundwater co2 at the water table bauer gottwein et al 2007 sanford and wood 1991 although this assumption is not always correct the aquifer in the lzb is mainly sandy and muddy unlike a karst aquifer where carbonate dissolution precipitation has a greater effect on the aquifer campana and fidelibus 2015 s√°inz garc√≠a et al 2011 therefore the top boundary of the model was assumed to be in constant equilibrium with atmospheric co2 pco2 10 3 5 atm which assumes that calcite and co2 remain in equilibrium kohfahl et al 2008 3 4 parameter settings and result calculations the hydraulic conductivity specific yield or specific storage of the aquifer and dispersion and molecular diffusion coefficients were based on previous results chang et al 2018 han et al 2011 liu 2018 cation exchange in groundwater is highly dependent on the cation exchange capacity cec of the aquifer media appelo and postma 2004 chen and jiao 2014 the cec of clay in the study area was set with reference to previous studies wu et al 1996a wu et al 1996b while the cec of sandy media was based on the study of zheng et al 2009 the final calibration parameters are presented in table 1 and fig 4 the concentration changes of major ions were calculated from the concentration ct in year t minus the concentration ct 1 in year t 1 i e ct ct 1 the cation exchange process at different stages was analyzed by calculating changes in the percentage of cation contents k x na x ca x and mg x in the exchanger i e cation content in year t minus the cation content in year t 1 4 results 4 1 model calibration aquifer hydraulic conductivity dispersion molecular diffusion coefficient and cation exchange capacity were calibrated by trial and error methods based on the monitoring results the calibration results were presented figs 5 6 the average residuals between the measured and calculated values of each major ion k na ca2 mg2 cl and so4 2 were 4 77 mg l 382 56 mg l 47 15 mg l 11 07 mg l 359 58 mg l and 11 91 mg l with correlation coefficients of 0 991 0 996 0 952 0 984 0 991 and 0 970 respectively in general the fitting errors of most ions were small but the results of hco3 concentration showed a large deviation for some points mainly because of the substantial variation in the pressure of co2 in groundwater mahlknecht et al 2017 the final calibration parameters in our model are presented in fig 4 and table 1 4 2 groundwater response to different exploitation periods the changes in the groundwater flow fields and major ion concentrations at different exploitation stages are shown in figs 7 8 we describe the responses based on different water quality regions for the freshwater brackish water region l 0 16 km there is no significant groundwater drawdown due to the weak pumping and groundwater flowing horizontally during the wp stage fig 8a after entering the sp stage the groundwater level began to decrease i e a maximum decrease of 16 m fig 8b and a groundwater depression l 8 13 km formed in the freshwater pumping zone when over exploitation began the ip stage the extend of the freshwater depression expanded l 1 21 km and groundwater still flowed horizontally but the velocity became larger than in the first two stages in terms of the hydrochemical response the major ions changed significantly only near the brackish water region where saltwater intrusion occurred from the wp to ip stages in the deep brackish water ca2 and mg2 decreased in the wp stage and then increased in the sp and ip stages whereas na showed a different trend this is mainly caused by saltwater intrusion which leads to the displacement of ca2 and mg2 by na for the saline water region l 16 32 km the groundwater flow was largely vertical during the wp stage fig 8a while the hydrodynamic field changed during the sp stage resulting in the formation of a groundwater divide gd l 17 km to the right of the freshwater pumping zone the groundwater on the left side of the gd flowed towards the freshwater depression and there was no significant change on the right side of the gd as compared with the wp stage fig 8b after entering the ip stage the gd moved to the right by l 24 km due to over exploitation the major ion concentrations except for hco3 and so4 2 in the shallow groundwater increased by variable degrees from the wp to ip stages due to evaporation the increases in na and cl were the most significant the maximum increases in na and cl were 740 and 1256 mg l respectively whereas the decreases in so4 2 and hco3 were due to water rock reactions for the deep groundwater there were no uniform changes in the major ions during the wp stage with increased exploitation from the sp to ip stages the concentration of each ion except for hco3 increased at the top z 30 to 50 m whereas the hypersaline water at the bottom z 50 to 90 m exhibited a trend of decreasing concentrations for the brine region l 32 42 km the groundwater level dropped abruptly due to brine extraction from the wp to ip stages and a groundwater depression l 33 40 km formed in the brine extraction zone during the sp stage the extent of the depression expanded l 28 43 km during the ip stage the concentration of shallow brine increased during the wp stage due to evaporation and the concentration decreased at the top of the deep groundwater z 30 to 70 m but increased at the bottom z 70 to 90 m during the sp stage the shallow brine concentration increased as a result of the accumulation of downward transported saline water around the margins of the depression however the deep brine concentration decreased significantly because of the pumping activities when over exploitation occurred i e the ip stage the brine concentration decreased dramatically with a maximum decrease in cl of 13 6 g l for the seaward saline water region l 42 50 km the hydrodynamic conditions did not change significantly from the wp to ip stages the hydrochemical response in this region was similar during the three pumping stages with the major ion concentrations in the upper region z 0 to 50 m increasing due to seawater intrusion whereas the hypersaline water at the bottom of this region z 50 to 90 m was diluted by seawater this suggests that seawater intrusion also has a role in reducing the groundwater salinity sun et al 2023 for example the evaporation induced salinity of intertidal groundwater is two times higher than that of seawater and thus the low concentration seawater acts as a dilutant geng et al 2016 4 3 hydrochemical processes in the different pumping stages the responses of the cations na ca2 and mg2 differ from those of the conservative ion cl because these ions are involved in water rock interactions therefore it is necessary to further explore the hydrochemical reactions between the aquifer matrix and groundwater 4 3 1 cation exchange given that k is mainly involved in chemisorption processes li et al 2013 zheng et al 2009 the changes in k x are limited fig 9 a c therefore we focused on the exchange between na ca2 and mg2 for the freshwater region l 0 10 km ca x and mg x exhibit inverse variations from the wp to ip stages indicative of ca2 and mg2 exchange given the main type of freshwater hydrochemistry is hco3 cl mg ca sun et al 2023 ca2 and mg2 exchange is driven by the affinity between water and the aquifer matrix with the affinity being ca2 mg2 na mart√≠nez and bocanegra 2002 for the brackish water region l 10 16 km na x and mg x increased but ca x decreased during the wp stage because saltwater intrusion results in an exchange between na and mg2 in saline water and ca2 in clay appelo and postma 2004 gim√©nez forcada 2014 after groundwater extraction was intensified the extent of replacement of ca2 by na in the shallow groundwater increased from the sp to ip stages whereas the deep brackish water underwent cation exchange of desalination processes after the direction of groundwater flow was reversed for the saline water region l 16 32 km the changes in cation contents near the brackish water region l 16 20 km were similar to those of the brackish water region the changes in na x were opposite to those of ca x and mg x during the three stages and na x increased and ca x and mg x decreased in the shallow groundwater while the changes in the deep groundwater were opposite to those in the shallow groundwater for the brine region l 32 42 km na x increased and ca x and mg x decreased in the shallow groundwater from the wp to sp stages following the decrease in the groundwater level ip stage the upper region of the deep brine had an increase in na x and a decrease in ca x and mg x whereas the bottom brine had a decrease in na x and an increase in ca x and mg x for the seaward saline water region l 42 50 km there was an obvious exchange between na and mg2 in groundwater with ca2 in clay due to seawater intrusion during the three stages 4 3 2 mineral dissolution and precipitation the distribution of calcite precipitation from the wp to ip stages fig 10 shows that the saline freshwater transition and brine seawater regions are the main calcite precipitation regions moreover the calcite content is higher maximum of 12 5 mol m3 in the transition zone and saline water region l 10 18 km than in the brine seawater region this is consistent with the results of xue et al 1997 who examined seawater saltwater intrusion into the lzb from the perspective of hydrochemistry and found that calcite precipitation occurred in the saline freshwater transition zone this process has been described in many other coastal zones and brine bearing groundwater systems worldwide for example wicks et al 1995 verified the hypothesis that the transition zone is a chemically active environment for carbonate mineral diagenesis by examining the groundwater chemical evolution in a carbonate aquifer in florida usa v√°squez et al 2013 simulated mineral precipitation in a brine bearing groundwater system in a playa evaporative basin chile and showed that calcite precipitation is highest in the saline freshwater transition zone in addition calcite precipitation occurs in the saline groundwater zone between brine and seawater and the extent of precipitation increases with increased seawater intrusion this is mainly due to seawater intrusion exacerbated by brine extraction and carbonate precipitation may occur in areas affected by seawater intrusion de montety et al 2008 5 discussion 5 1 contribution of driving factors to hydrochemical changes our results show that changes in the hydrodynamic field and water rock interactions can affect the groundwater hydrochemistry in summary this coastal groundwater system is in a natural evolutionary phase during the wp stage when hydrodynamic changes are caused by density gradients similar dynamic processes have been observed in brine bearing groundwater systems in evaporative basins hamann et al 2015 v√°squez et al 2013 and salt lake groundwater systems yager et al 2007 after over exploitation a complex hydrodynamic field formed and a gd hindered the migration of brine or saline waters across the gd to the freshwater zone which made the path and rate of saltwater intrusion more complex than those of modern seawater intrusion given the complex processes that affect coastal groundwaters the main controlling factors on hydrochemical changes need to be further identified therefore we assessed the contributions of changes in groundwater hydrodynamic field and water rock interactions to changes in groundwater hydrochemistry to quantify these contributions in the simulation for the period 1992 2015 we employed a regression method wang et al 2022a wu et al 2020 and used changes in groundwater level cation contents na x in the exchanger and calcite content as predictor variables using the following equation 3 y a 1 x 1 a 2 x 2 a 3 x 3 b where y is the standardized groundwater tds concentration and xi is the standardized groundwater level cation content and calcite content changes for each cell ai i 1 2 3 and b are the regression coefficients and intercept respectively the contributions were calculated with regression coefficients between 0 and 1 as follows 4 contr i a i i 1 3 a i the results fig 11 show that the driving mechanisms of groundwater hydrochemical changes due to pumping activities are complex but can be divided into five regions as follows 1 freshwater zone exchange of ca2 and mg2 is the primary control on groundwater hydrochemical changes outside the depression whereas hydrodynamic changes and cation exchange are the main drivers in the vicinity of the freshwater pumping zone 2 saline fresh water transition zone complex hydrochemical processes occur in this zone and shallow groundwater is controlled by cation exchange while deep groundwater is primarily affected by the dissolution and precipitation of carbonates 3 saline brine water zone although this zone is far from the pumping site the intensive pumping has changed the groundwater hydrodynamic field therefore the main driving factor in the deep groundwater is hydrodynamic change while mineral precipitation is the main driver in the shallow groundwater 4 brine pumping zone like the freshwater pumping zone large fluctuations in groundwater level are caused by the pumping activities in addition hydrochemical reactions occur during the transport of surrounding groundwater to the center of the brine depression therefore the driving mechanism in shallow groundwater include changes in the hydrodynamic conditions and water rock interactions whereas cation exchange and mineral precipitation are the main driving factors in deep groundwater 5 seaward saline water zone this zone is mainly affected by seawater intrusion although cation exchange also occurs in this zone the effects of mineral precipitation are the main control 5 2 effects of groundwater extraction on the aquifer matrix 5 2 1 effects of mineral precipitation on aquifer porosity and permeability when the permeability of an aquifer changes due to mineral reactions groundwater flow is affected which in turn affects water rock interactions campana and fidelibus 2015 post and prommer 2007 therefore there is a feedback between groundwater and aquifer media the relationship between aquifer porosity and the molar volume of mineral species is as follows v√°squez et al 2013 5 n t 1 n t n t i minerals m o l a r v o l i precipitatedquantityofi 0 d i s s o l v e d q u a n t i t y o f i 0 where n t is the porosity at time t and molar vol is the values adopted for the molar volume which for calcite is 3 7 10 5 m3 mol clauser and bartels 2003 the variations in aquifer permeability caused by water rock interactions were calculated based on the carman kozeny equation pape et al 2000 6 k k 0 n n 0 df where k 0 is the permeability of the reference state lt 1 it was assumed that the exponent df is 4 based on these equations we calculated the changes in permeability calcite precipitation was highest in the saline freshwater transition zone up to 12 5 mol m3 converted according to the density of water of 1 g cm3 the maximum changes in porosity and permeability were 0 9995 and 0 9981 times the original values respectively however for a karst aquifer the dissolution of calcite can cause a maximum change in aquifer porosity of 0 85 times the original values s√°inz garc√≠a et al 2011 therefore the dissolution and precipitation of minerals in a muddy coastal zone have little effect on the spatial structure of the aquifer 5 2 2 irreversible effects on the aquifer matrix any process that alters the structure and chemical composition of a porous medium may affect the aquifer matrix processes that cause long term stable and persistent transformations in the subsurface environment are defined as being irreversible yaron et al 2008 yaron et al 2010 the previous section discussed the effects of carbonate precipitation on the permeability of the medium but the changes in the groundwater hydrodynamics and cation exchange processes are also not negligible we assessed the effects of these factors on the aquifer matrix over exploitation of groundwater causes a widespread decrease in water levels which can trigger land subsidence as has been reported for many muddy coastal zones worldwide higgins et al 2013 minderhoud et al 2017 this is because fluctuations in groundwater level can change the effective stresses of the aquifer matrix resulting in compaction or swelling of sediments in the aquifer hughes et al 2022 unfortunately this process is usually irreversible ojha et al 2018 therefore the aquifer matrix will undergo irreversible changes in areas where the hydrodynamic changes are dominant such as the freshwater and brine pumping zones in particular for the brine pumping zone in the present study the groundwater table fell by 40 m due to over exploitation which would cause serious damage to aquifer hydrological properties of aquifer media may change due to the dissolution precipitation of minerals fine particle release and capture and clay swelling saripalli et al 2001 previous studies have concluded that the changes of the spatial configuration of the matrix of the porous medium as a result of clay particle migration are irreversible goldenberg et al 1983 konikow et al 2001 yaron et al 2010 dissolution precipitation of minerals in the aquifer matrix has similar effects on a porous medium luquot and gouze 2009 sonkamble 2012 for example rezaei et al 2005 suggested that dissolution precipitation of calcite in the transition zone between saline water and freshwater would change the structure of the porous medium and consequently the aquifer permeability niu and zhang 2019 confirmed this result using a pore scale numerical approach therefore based on our results calcite that precipitates in the saline fresh water transition zone and on its seaward side would also variably change the pore structure of the porous media leading to irreversible changes in the permeability of the aquifer another process that affects the aquifer matrix is cation exchange which changes the cation composition of clays in the sediment parkhurst and appelo 2013 post and prommer 2007 although numerous studies have suggested that the direction of cation exchange would be reversed when the groundwater flow direction is reversed andersen et al 2005 capuano and jones 2020 prusty and farooq 2021 it is difficult to fully return to the previous state based on our results a change in groundwater flow direction leads to deep brackish saline waters undergoing cation exchange in freshening and salinizing conditions as such the changes relating to cation exchange are also irreversible in summary the effects of human activities on aquifers in muddy coastal zones are mainly the irreversible damage to the aquifer matrix caused by a decrease in the groundwater level after over exploitation although mineral dissolution precipitation reactions can also damage the spatial structure of porous media their effects on an aquifer in muddy coastal zones are much less than those on carbonate aquifers therefore when developing strategies for groundwater management in such areas priority should be given to the control of groundwater levels 6 conclusions a reactive transport model was developed to investigate the hydrochemical processes in groundwater for a muddy coastal zone affected by pumping activities the findings of this study highlight the complex evolution of groundwater in such areas due to various driving mechanisms including hydrodynamic conditions and water rock interactions the simulation results indicate that the hydrodynamic and hydrochemical responses to pumping activity exhibit spatial variability after intensive groundwater extraction the natural equilibrium conditions were perturbed and hydrodynamic changes were dominant factor in the area where the groundwater level decreased and the flow direction changed furthermore water rock interactions were found to have a significant effect on the saline fresh water transition zone although the saline fresh water transition zone is a chemically active environment for carbonate mineral diagenesis the minerals reactions in a muddy coastal zone have less effect on the spatial structure of an aquifer as compared with karst regions our results suggest that groundwater drawdown caused by over exploitation may cause irreversible damage to the groundwater environment in muddy coastal zones therefore control of groundwater levels should be a priority in the groundwater management strategy such areas credit authorship contribution statement qiming sun writing original draft maosheng gao writing review editing

1898,previous 3d studies on the effectiveness of subsurface barriers against seawater intrusion in coastal aquifers have been largely limited to numerical models lacking analytical methods that are easy to implement and computationally efficient this study presents an analytical methodology based on the schwartz christoffel conformal mapping method and the potential theory for predicting the extent of seawater intrusion and the maximum safe extraction rate of a single well in a head controlled rectangular coastal aquifer with the addition of a subsurface physical barrier the barrier is assumed to fully penetrate the aquifer depth and has a finite length in the shore parallel direction consistency between analytical and numerical results highlights the capability of the proposed method to predict the steady state toe position and the maximum safe extraction rate the sensitivity analysis indicates that for a given barrier length the optimal barrier location i e distance to the coastline depends on the aquifer conditions i e dispersivity hydraulic gradient and the thickness of the aquifer in terms of the effectiveness of fully penetrating barriers in reducing the extent of seawater intrusion whereas the fully penetrating barriers that are longer and closer to the extraction well are always more effective in enhancing the maximum safe extraction rate independent of aquifer conditions the presented methodology provides a simple analytical tool for first order assessment of seawater wedge extents and safe extraction rates in response to engineered barriers in coastal aquifers serving as an alternative to 3d numerical modeling keywords subsurface barrier coastal aquifer conformal mapping seawater intrusion groundwater extraction data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction the management of fresh groundwater resources in coastal aquifers is often challenged by seawater intrusion a worldwide problem that is mainly caused by overexploitation and could be exacerbated by sea level rise werner et al 2013 various strategies have been proposed to prevent seawater intrusion and to enhance the freshwater storage in coastal aquifers including artificial freshwater replenishment mahesha 1996 lu et al 2017 shi et al 2020 saltwater extraction pool and carrera 2010 masciopinto 2013 ebeling et al 2019 stein et al 2020 compressed air injection dror et al 2004 sun and semprich 2013 aquifer hydraulic conductivity modification strack et al 2016 lu et al 2019 and subsurface physical barriers luyun et al 2009 abdoulhalik and ahmed 2017 li et al 2018 zheng et al 2020 the effectiveness of the subsurface physical barrier in controlling seawater intrusion and enhancing freshwater storage has long been investigated oude essink 2001 werner et al 2013 most of previous studies on this topic were based on 2d models i e shore perpendicular cross sectional representations of the aquifer where subsurface barriers were assumed to fully cover the entire width of the aquifer in the shore parallel direction e g sugio et al 1987 mahesha 2009 however existing engineered subsurface barriers usually adopt finite lengths due to cost limitations and construction constraints japan green resources agency 2004 for example subsurface barriers to prevent seawater intrusion in coastal aquifers in japan were reported to have finite lengths mostly in the range of 74 m to 550 m parallel to the coastline japan green resources agency 2004 in china the lengths of subsurface barriers constructed in coastal aquifers were reported to be between 545 m and 6 000 m shi and jiao 2014 therefore from a more realistic perspective a 3d analysis of the effectiveness of existing subsurface barriers would be more applicable despite the importance very few 3d investigations of subsurface barriers in coastal aquifers are available to the best of our knowledge only kaleris and ziogas 2013 and wu et al 2020a used 3d numerical models both considering a conceptual rectangular coastal aquifer to analyze the effectiveness of the subsurface barrier in preventing seawater intrusion and enhancing safe extraction rate i e the pumping rate without leading to the salinization of a single well kaleris and ziogas 2013 demonstrated that the effectiveness of subsurface barriers in enhancing safe extraction rates increased in wider aquifers wu et al 2020a found that barrier benefits may be significantly overestimated when ignoring the effect of the shore parallel length of the barrier these studies i e kaleris and ziogas 2013 wu et al 2020a highlighted the necessity of 3d analysis when evaluating subsurface barrier effectiveness furthermore previous investigations on coastal physical barriers largely employed numerical and experimental models e g kaleris and ziogas 2013 chang et al 2019 zheng et al 2021 though the results from the two models can characterize the mixing between freshwater and seawater they are constrained by either the significant computational cost or the spatial scale and thus have limited broader scale predictive capabilities to avoid these issues analytical approaches based on the sharp interface assumption have been frequently employed to conduct first order assessments for seawater intrusion extent and well pumping in coastal aquifers without physical barriers strack 1976 lu et al 2012 shi et al 2020 to date however only anwar 1983 derived an analytical solution for the sharp interface location under the effect of a subsurface barrier in a 2d unconfined coastal aquifer given the necessity of 3d investigations of subsurface barriers in coastal aquifers e g kaleris and ziogas 2013 wu et al 2020a analytical solutions for determining the extent of saltwater intrusion and allowable freshwater extraction in 3d barrier embedded coastal aquifers are currently warranted this is also expected to broaden the applicability of the analytical method to the problems that were previously only possible using 3d numerical modeling in this work we present an analytical methodology capable of assessing the performance of a finite length barrier in reducing the seawater extent and enhancing the safe extraction rate in coastal aquifers the proposed methodology combines the schwartz christoffel sc conformal mapping method and potential theory where the sc mapping is applied to facilitate the application of potential theory e g hunt 1985a hunt 1985b lu et al 2015 the applicability and robustness of the methodology are subsequently validated against variable density flow numerical simulations the methodology developed in our study has the potential to be a simple analytical tool for evaluating the subsurface barrier effectiveness in combating seawater intrusion in coastal aquifers 2 conceptual model fig 1 shows a conceptual model of a rectangular coastal aquifer including both unconfined fig 1b and confined scenarios fig 1c as shown in fig 1a the idealized coastal aquifer i e homogeneous isotropic uniform geometry has a rectangular domain in the plane view with dimensions l length w width the uniform thickness of the confined aquifer is denoted as b fig 1c the seaside and landside are respectively represented by specified head boundary conditions of the seawater head h s and the freshwater head h f above the horizontal aquifer base while the lateral boundaries are impermeable i e no flow the freshwater and seawater densities are œÅ f and œÅ s respectively with corresponding salt concentrations of c f and c s as shown in fig 1a the x and y axes coincide with the centerline of the domain width and the shoreline respectively with the origin at the point where the x and y axes intersect the freshwater piezometric level relative to the aquifer base is denoted as h f x y a fully penetrating impermeable barrier with a finite length l b is placed parallel to the coast at a distance d b x w from the coastline a fully penetrating well that pumps groundwater from the aquifer at a rate q is located at a distance x w from the coastline the conceptual model is symmetrical about the shore perpendicular axis i e x axis that passes through both the middle of the barrier and the center of the extraction well fig 1a two different scenarios are considered including a barrier only i e the aquifer contains a physical barrier without pumping and b barrier well i e the aquifer contains both a physical barrier and a pumping well systems the seawater wedge toe position and the maximum safe pumping rate i e the critical pumping rate without causing salinization of the single well are analyzed in the barrier only and the barrier well systems respectively 3 methodology 3 1 assumptions to facilitate the development of the analytical methodology the following assumptions are adopted e g lu and luo 2014 lu et al 2017 1 the system is under steady state where land surface processes e g evapotranspiration and recharge and transient processes of the boundary e g fluctuation tide and wave effect are neglected 2 the sharp interface assumption is adopted i e neglecting the mixing between freshwater and saltwater 3 the dupuit forchheimer approximation is introduced to eliminate the resistance to the vertical flow 4 the ghyben herzberg relation is adopted for determining the interface toe position moreover two zones separated by the interface toe are formed i e zone 1 containing the interface and zone 2 of the remainder of the aquifer fig 1 in this study we consider a head controlled system i e the aquifer with a constant head inland boundary as representatives of coastal aquifers involving river lake etc which have also been employed in previous studies of seawater intrusion e g lu et al 2012 lu and luo 2014 such head controlled systems are often distinguished from flux controlled systems i e aquifers with a constant flux inland boundary nonetheless lu et al 2012 demonstrated that different inland boundary conditions i e constant head and constant flux led to minor deviations in the maximum pumping rate of a single well when the aquifer dimension in shore perpendicular direction is greater than five times the distance between the extraction well and the coastline 3 2 mathematical derivation given the dupuit approximation and the ghyben herzberg relation the potential function —Ñ proposed by strack 1976 is applicable to the solution domain for an unconfined coastal aquifer —Ñ can be written as strack 1976 1 zone 1 œÜ k 2 1 1 Œµ h f h s 2 2 zone 2 œÜ k 2 h f 2 1 Œµ h s 2 in which k is the aquifer hydraulic conductivity and …õ is the density ratio defined as œÅ s œÅ f œÅ f for a confined coastal aquifer —Ñ can be expressed as strack 1976 3 zone 1 œÜ k 2 Œµ h f Œµ b Œµ 1 h s 2 4 zone 2 œÜ k b h f 1 2 k Œµ b 2 Œµ 1 k b h s according to the definition of potential flow —Ñ satisfies 5 2 œÜ x 2 2 œÜ y 2 0 eq 5 holds everywhere in the solution domain except at the well point x w 0 hunt 1985a in addition for an unconfined coastal aquifer —Ñ satisfies the following boundary conditions 6 œÜ y 0 x y on lateral no flow boundary 7 œÜ 0 x y on sea boundary 8 œÜ k 2 h f 2 1 Œµ h s 2 x y on inland boundary where eqs 7 and 8 are based on eqs 1 and 2 for a confined coastal aquifer eq 6 is also applicable while eqs 7 and 8 should be replaced according to eqs 3 and 4 by 9 œÜ Œµ k 2 h s b 2 x y on sea boundary 10 œÜ k b h f 1 2 k Œµ b 2 Œµ 1 k b h s x y on inland boundary however the solution of equations 5 8 for unconfined coastal aquifers or eqs 5 6 9 and 10 for confined coastal aquifers cannot be directly derived because the fully penetrating barrier functions as an internal no flow boundary i e blocking flow perpendicular to the barrier fig 1 producing a multiply connected domain to address this the model domain is simplified according to symmetry and the sc mapping method is introduced to reduce the complexity of the boundary geometry as explained below fig 2 shows different aquifer domain scenarios including the z plane representing the real domain showing the boundary scenarios corresponding to fig 1a and the w plane representing the image domain showing the desired boundary scenarios where the solution to the problem defined above i e eqs 5 8 or eqs 5 6 9 and 10 can be easily derived specifically fig 2a shows the boundary condition scenario consistent with fig 1a where symmetry allows only the upper half of the model domain to be analyzed fig 2b shows a representative view of a special case where the barrier and the coastline coincide the main difficulty is how to map the bounded polygons in fig 2a and 2b onto the interior of a rectangle bounded by two parallel constant head boundaries and two parallel impermeable boundaries i e fig 2c and 2d respectively it should be noted that the number of vertices required to obtain a corrected inverse mapping i e mapping the w plane upon the z plane is different for the scenarios of fig 2c and 2d the transformations between the z and w planes can be achieved by the application of sc transformation in the forms 11 w f z mapping the z plane upon the w plane 12 z g w mapping the w plane upon the z plane where z x iy w u iv and i is the imaginary unit generally the exact form of the sc mapping formula i e eqs 11 and 12 cannot be derived analytically for the mapping with more than four vertices e g the scenarios shown in fig 2a and 2b as an alternative the sc toolbox for achieving sc mapping and its inverse numerically incorporated into matlab developed by driscoll 1994 is applied to achieve the transformations between the z and w planes for example the rectmap function of the sc toolbox can easily implement the mapping from the bounded polygon interior in the z plane upon a rectangle interior in the w plane i e solving eq 11 and its inverse can be determined by the evalinv function i e solving eq 12 applying the symmetry again it can be further assumed that fig 2c or 2d represents the upper half of an otherwise fully bounded rectangular aquifer of geometry l length along the u axis w width along the v axis which is similar to the coastal aquifer setting illustrated in fig 1a but without a physical barrier that is by performing the sc mapping the problem is simplified to examine the maximum safe pumping rate of a single well in a rectangular coastal aquifer where the internal boundary i e the impermeable barrier is eliminated note that l and w can be determined by vertices positions in the w plane lu and luo 2014 derived the analytical solution for the interface toe position and the maximum safe pumping rate of a single well located in a fully bounded rectangular coastal aquifer i e the scenarios shown in fig 2c or 2d based on the potential theory and the image well superposition method the assumptions undertaken in their investigation are consistent with those adopted in the current study e g steady state sharp interface assumption such that their analytical solutions can be directly used for the scenarios shown in fig 2c or 2d for the sake of brevity only the expressions for determining the seawater wedge toe position i e z toe and the maximum safe pumping rate i e q m are given below the derivation process of which is summarized in text s1 see the supplementary material the reader is also referred to lu and luo 2014 for detailed mathematical derivation 3 2 1 scenario a seawater wedge toe position for unconfined and confined aquifers without pumping i e scenario a barrier only system the toe position of seawater wedge in the w plane only with respect to the u axis i e u toe can be respectively determined by lu and luo 2014 13 unconfined u toe Œµ Œµ 1 l h s 2 h f 2 Œµ 1 h s 2 14 confined u toe Œµ b l 2 h f Œµ 1 h s Œµ b the toe position obtained in the w plane can be expressed by a complex variable as 15 w toe u toe i v toe in which v toe represents the toe position along the v axis note that v toe for scenario a can be an arbitrary value in the range of w 2 to w 2 once the toe position in the w plane i e w toe is determined the corresponding toe position in the z plane i e z toe defined as x toe iy toe can be easily obtained by eq 12 that can be solved numerically using evalinv function of the sc toolbox 3 2 2 scenario b maximum safe pumping rate for the barrier well system the pumping rate q in the w plane is related to the stagnation point of the extraction well u s and the toe position u toe at the model center i e v 0 which is respectively given as lu and luo 2014 16 q 4 œÄ œÜ toe q f u toe l m ln cosh œÄ m w cos œÄ u toe u w cosh œÄ m w cos œÄ u toe u w 17 q 4 q f l m sin œÄ u s u w cosh œÄ m w cos œÄ u s u w sin œÄ u s u w cosh œÄ m w cos œÄ u s u w where the potential at the toe position œÜ toe and the freshwater groundwater discharge q f are defined for unconfined and confined coastal aquifers respectively as lu and luo 2014 18 unconfined œÜ

x w is given the theoretical maximum safe pumping rate q m for scenario b is achieved when u s coincides with u toe at v 0 e g strack 1976 lu and luo 2014 accordingly q m can be calculated by an iterative procedure combining eqs 16 and 17 as suggested by lu and luo 2014 it should be noted that q m has the same value in the w plane and its inverse plane i e the z plane because the stagnation point of the extraction well z s and the toe position x toe at the model center i e y 0 must coincide in the z plane if the corresponding u s coincides with u toe in the w plane 3 3 correction factor the analytical solution derived based on the assumption of the sharp freshwater seawater interface is known to overestimate the state steady toe position and underestimate the maximum safe pumping rate compared to numerical simulations that include the mixing effect between freshwater and seawater to eliminate this discrepancy between analytical results and the numerical simulation results pool and carrera 2011 proposed an empirical correction factor based on the density ratio 20 Œµ Œµ 1 Œ± t b 1 6 1 where …õ is the corrected density ratio eq 20 is determined and examined merely for the maximum safe pumping rate of a single well located in the flux controlled system i e the aquifer with a constant flux inland boundary whereas for the head controlled system considered in the current study lu and werner 2013 found that the correction factor proposed by pool and carrera 2011 i e eq 20 should be modified to 21 Œµ Œµ 1 Œ± t b 1 4 1 it is found that the analytical solution corrected by eq 21 can well reproduce the numerical toe position i e indicated by 0 1 isochlor in the head controlled coastal aquifer lu and werner 2013 this representative value i e 0 1 isochlor generally leads to a more landward toe position than other commonly used values e g 0 5 and 0 9 isochlors thereby providing a more conservative assessment of seawater intrusion nonetheless the applicability of eq 21 for the maximum safe extraction rate has not been validated a systematic evaluation of the correction factor is beyond the aims of this study here we focus on two correction factors that are often employed in previous studies i e eqs 20 and 21 the predicted maximum safe extraction rate in the head controlled system is corrected using both eqs 20 and 21 and compared to the corresponding numerical results see fig s1 supplementary material fig s1 highlights the applicability of eq 21 to head controlled systems therefore eq 21 is introduced as the correction factor in the current study 3 4 dimensionless parameters and quantitative indicators to eliminate dimension effects dimensionless parameters are introduced according to the dimensionless analysis presented in previous works i e lu et al 2012 kaleris and ziogas 2013 lu and luo 2014 that is the parameters with a unit of length e g x y z toe w h f and h s or volumetric flow rate e g q m are normalized by x w or x w q f respectively in the current study the dimensionless variables are labeled by a superscript star e g x z t o e and q m in scenario a the toe positions before z t o e 0 and after z t o e 1 barrier construction are calculated and compared to quantify the effectiveness of the barriers in reducing the extent of seawater intrusion the relative change in the toe position across the width of the aquifer i e Œ¥ s t o e is introduced as 22 Œ¥ s toe y w 2 w 2 z toe0 z toe1 d x y w 2 w 2 z toe0 d x obviously greater Œ¥ s t o e values indicate the barriers that are more effective in reducing the seawater intrusion extent in scenario b the maximum safe pumping rates before q m 0 and after q m 1 the barrier construction are determined the relative change in the maximum safe pumping rate is given as 23 Œ¥ q m q m1 q m0 q m0 where a larger Œ¥ q m indicates a better performance of the barrier in enhancing the maximum safe pumping rate 4 numerical validation numerical simulation is often applied to validate analytical methods e g lu et al 2016 wu et al 2020b jazayeri et al 2020 in this study numerical simulation is conducted using seawat 2000 a program designed to simulate 3d variable

Œ¥ z 2 the current discretization yields pe m 1 6 satisfying eq 24 the time step Œ¥t is set to 2 5 days and the courant number c r is 1 the total simulation time is 120 000 days sufficient to obtain steady state conditions for all tested cases the impermeable barrier is simulated as the internal no flow boundary the barrier thickness coincides with the cell size in the x direction i e 2 5 m and the barrier height is consistent with the model height i e 20 m in scenario a the physical barrier is designed to exclude seawater on the landward side of the barrier to be consistent with eq 21 the toe position obtained from numerical simulations is defined as the point where 0 1 isochlor intersects with the aquifer base selected barrier lengths i e 400 m 800 m 1200 m and 1600 m and locations i e 0 m 100 m and 200 m are tested in scenario a all barriers are placed within the initial seawater wedge toe position i e 243 2 m prior to the barrier condition for seawater intrusion exclusion the dimensionless values of barrier parameters are given in table 2 in scenario b we consider a single well fixed at x w 500 m the simulated barrier lengths in scenario b are consistent with those of scenario a while more barrier locations i e 0 m 100 m 200 m 300 m and 400 m are simulated in scenario b q m is examined under various settings of the barrier which is determined as that causes the average salinity of the pumped water under steady state to reach an allowable salinity limit i e 0 1 of seawater as suggested by pool and carrera 2011 in numerical simulations an observation well is placed at the well site to monitor whether the average salinity in the well column was constant in time and had reached the predefined threshold q m can be obtained by repeatedly running the model and modifying pumping i e trial and error optimization wu et al 2020a to quantitatively assess the accuracy of analytical predictions we define the relative maximum safe pumping rate difference i e Œ∑ as 25 Œ∑ q m ana q m num q m num 100 where the second subscript i e ana and num represents q m obtained from the analytical and the numerical approach respectively obviously a lower absolute value of Œ∑ indicates a more accurate analytical prediction of q m 4 2 results fig 3 shows the comparison between the analytical and the numerical z t o e for scenario a where various barrier settings i e different combinations of l b and d b and the no barrier case are considered as shown in fig 3 the barrier reduces the extent of saltwater in all tested cases where the analytical z t o e hollow circles shows reasonable agreement with the numerical z t o e solid lines both numerical and analytical z t o e indicate similar trends as l b or d b increases that is for l b 1 6 the barrier placed closer to the shore i e smaller d b leads to more seaward z t o e fig 3a except for the case with d b 0 2 where z t o e values indicated in blue are found to be slight seaward of z t o e values of the case with d b 0 indicated in red in the regions adjacent to the barrier edge i e y l b 2 0 8 this phenomenon occurs because the seaward freshwater flow blocked by the impermeable barrier of d b 0 2 is concentrated to the edge of the barrier which pushes the seawater wedge toe further back in addition the longer barrier i e larger l b produces more seaward z t o e for the case with d b 0 fig 3b as expected where barriers with l b 1 6 cause the toe to intersect with the impermeable barrier indicating a significant reduction in the seawater wedge extent whereas for the barrier with l b 0 8 z t o e still stays on its landward side the magenta line in fig 3b this outcome suggests that for relatively short barriers seawater may bypass its edges and thus seawater wedge upstream of the barrier cannot be effectively removed the analytical and the numerical q m and corresponding Œ∑ values for scenario b are shown in fig 4 where various combinations of d b i e 0 0 2 0 4 0 6 and 0 8 and l b i e 0 8 1 6 2 4 and 3 2 are considered as shown in fig 4a the derived analytical solution generally well reproduces the numerical q m the relative differences between numerical simulations and analytical results i e Œ∑ have a maximum value of 9 9 which was obtained for the case with the longest barrier located along the coastline i e l b 3 2 and d b 0 fig 4b moreover unlike the impact on the interface toe when the barrier is closer to the well a larger q m is obtained fig 4b indicates that for the case with the short barrier e g l b 0 8 a relatively low value of Œ∑ i e Œ∑ 3 6 is obtained for any selected d b for l b 3 2 Œ∑ is large when d b 0 and 0 2 i e Œ∑ 9 9 and 9 8 respectively while Œ∑ remains relatively low i e Œ∑ 3 6 for d b 0 6 and 0 8 larger values of Œ∑ for d b 0 and 0 2 can be mainly attributed to the limitation of the numerical approximation of the sc mapping i e the well known crowding phenomenon driscoll 1994 crowding is a problem commonly encountered in the numerical sc mapping involving an elongated region and the problem is hard to be solved when the local aspect ratio i e l b d b exceeds about 20 driscoll 1994 that is a longer barrier placed at d b 0 2 gives rise to a larger local aspect ratio i e l b d b and thus may induce a greater error specially for d b 0 the increasing length of the barrier narrows the boundary ab see fig 2b where the crowding phenomenon becomes apparent 5 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis is conducted based on the proposed methodology to identify the effectiveness of the barrier under various aquifer conditions adapted from the base case table 1 focusing on the effect of different values of transverse dispersivity Œ± t inland hydraulic heads h f and aquifer thickness b three representative values of d b i e 0 0 2 and 0 4 are examined in scenario a in scenario b d b ranging from 0 2 to 0 8 are assessed l b in the range of 0 8 to 3 2 are evaluated in both scenarios a and b 5 1 scenario a barrier only system fig 5 shows the sensitivity of Œ¥ s t o e to l b and d b under various aquifer conditions including the cases of Œ± t 0 0002 0 0005 and 0 002 h f 0 0616 0 062 and 0 064 and b 0 02 0 04 and 0 06 as shown in fig 5 the impact of l b and d b on Œ¥ s t o e is dependent on the aquifer conditions for example in the scenarios of the smallest Œ± t i e 0 0002 the lowest h f i e 0 0616 or the largest b i e 0 02 a greater l b leads to a larger Œ¥ s t o e for a given d b a1 b1 and c3 of fig 5 as expected whereas the optimal d b that results in the largest Œ¥ s t o e depends on the specific barrier length that is for a relatively long barrier e g l b 3 2 the optimal d b is 0 while for a relatively short barrier e g l b 0 8 seawater may bypass the barrier edge when the barrier is close to the coastline reducing the barrier effectiveness as explained in fig 3 and thus the optimal d b is 0 2 e g fig 5 a1 or 0 4 e g fig 5 b1 and c3 in the scenarios of the largest Œ± t i e 0 002 the highest h f i e 0 064 or the smallest b i e 0 02 a lower d b leads to a larger Œ¥ s t o e for a given l b fig 5 a3 b3 and c1 whereas relationships between Œ¥ s t o e and l b are complex depending on d b that is for d b 0 Œ¥ s t o e increases with the increasing l b while for d b 0 4 a larger l b results in a lower negative value of Œ¥ s t o e fig 5 a3 b3 and c1 this outcome occurs because under the aquifer conditions of Œ± t 0 002 h f 0 064 or b 0 02 the barrier placed at d b 0 4 is more landward than z t o e 0 i e the initial seawater wedge toe position before the barrier construction and causes seawater to accumulate downstream of the barrier in addition Œ¥ s t o e may be a non monotonic function of l b e g d b 0 4 in fig 5 a2 and d b 0 2 in fig 5 b3 that is for a given d b the barrier may have an optimal l b that gives rise to a peak value of Œ¥ s t o e this non monotonic behavior of Œ¥ s t o e can be attributed to the re accumulation of seawater downstream of the barrier as the barrier length increases which is evidenced by z t o e shown in fig s2 see the supplementary material 5 2 scenario b barrier well system the sensitivity of Œ¥ q m to different l b and d b is shown in fig 6 the effectiveness of the barrier is examined under the base case i e Œ± t 0 0005 h f 0 062 and b 0 04 and the modified cases that use different Œ± t i e 0 0002 or 0 002 h f i e 0 0616 or 0 064 or b i e 0 02 or 0 06 as expected a barrier that is longer i e larger l b and closer to the well i e larger d b leads to a higher Œ¥ q m under all aquifer conditions that are considered fig 6 for a given l b and d b the barrier is found to perform optimally i e producing the largest Œ¥ q m when the aquifer has the smallest Œ± t the lowest h f or the greatest b as shown in fig 6 it should be noted that a low Œ¥ q m may not correspond to a small increament in q m as shown by sensitivity values of q m in fig s3 see the supplementary material for a given l b and d b the largest q m 0 and q m 1 are obtained in the aquifer with the greatest Œ± t the highest h f or the lowest b this occurs because the aquifer of greater Œ± t higher h f or lower b can lead to z t o e 0 that is more seaward thereby allowing a larger q m for a single well placed at a fixed distance to the coastline 6 discussion the results of this study indicate that seawater can bypass the edges of short barriers close to the shore reducing the effectiveness of the barrier in excluding seawater whereas for the barrier close to the initial toe position i e prior to the barrier construction a long barrier may cause the seawater to reaccumulate downstream of the barrier and thus are not as superior as shorter barriers fig s2 this nuances the previous 3d investigation of wu et al 2020a who found that a longer fully penetrating barrier should achieve a greater reduction of the seawater intrusion extent clearly a comprehensive analysis of a wide range of barrier lengths and locations under various aquifer conditions which however is often unfordable in 3d numerical models provides important insights into the ideal positioning of fully penetrating barriers previous studies e g kaleris and ziogas 2013 wu et al 2020a have demonstrated that the type of coastal aquifers i e confined or unconfined has little effect on determining the effectiveness of the subsurface barriers provided that the thickness of the confined aquifer is comparable to that of the corresponding unconfined aquifer i e confined aquifers of a confining layer at the sea level see fig 1c can represent unconfined aquifers confined aquifers are defined in their numerical models as approximations of unconfined aquifers to reduce computational costs nonetheless this approximation has only been validated under a few numerical model scenarios e g kaleris and ziogas 2013 a systematic comparison of the barrier effectiveness in unconfined and confined coastal aquifers can be easily performed based on the proposed methodology see examples given in figs s4 and s5 in the supplementary material the results in figs s4 and s5 highlight the accuracy of the approximation at least for the parameter values used in the current study where the toe positions obtained in unconfined and confined aquifers almost coincide and the difference in Œ¥ q m is less than 0 8 in the current study predictions using the proposed methodology are largely consistent with numerical simulations the errors in the predicted maximum safe pumping rate fig 4 are attributable to the inclusion of the correction factor i e eq 21 and the crowding problem whereas the difference caused by the correction factor is negligible i e Œ∑ 1 4 1 1 fig s1b in the supplementary material the main errors are induced by the numerical approximation of the sc mapping using the sc toolbox in matlab i e causing the crowding problem methods that can better solve this problem e g using higher precision arithmetic and more accurate numerical methods for the sc mapping can be further incorporated into the presented methodology which is expected to improve prediction accuracy but at the expense of computational cost e g driscoll 2005 the empirical correction factor i e eq 21 is introduced to involve the mixing effect such that predicted toe positions and maximum safe extraction rates are associated with the specific salinity values this not only facilitates the validation of the proposed methodology against numerical modeling but also yields insights into the application of the proposed analytical based method as an alternative to the 3d numerical model in addition these representative values of salinity are in accordance with previous studies e g 0 1 isochlor toe position by lu and werner 2013 and 0 1 mixed seawater threshold of the maximum safe pumping rate by pool and carrera 2011 which are expected to provide relatively conservative strategies for groundwater management of barrier embedded coastal aquifers wu et al 2020a furthermore other factors that are not included in the current study such as layered aquifers multi well systems and multiple barriers can also be conceptualized by the developed methodology for example previous analytical solutions of seawater intrusion in layered coastal aquifers e g strack and ausk 2015 rathore et al 2018 rathore et al 2020 or multi well systems e g mantoglou 2003 mantoglou et al 2004 shi et al 2020 are applicable to the image domains of rectangular shape see fig 2 similar problems associated with real domains with the addition of subsurface barriers see fig 2 can be solved accordingly by applying the sc mapping method nonetheless the horizontal flow nature of the current methodology precludes the analysis of other processes with non negligible variability in the vertical direction such as partially penetrating barriers or extraction wells which warrant further investigations 7 conclusions in this study we propose an analytical methodology for quantifying the steady state seawater wedge toe position and the maximum safe extraction rate of a single well in head controlled coastal aquifers with the addition of a finite length fully penetrating barrier the analytical solutions generally well reproduce the shape interface locations and the allowable extraction rates obtained from the numerical model the sensitivity analysis shows that the optimal barrier parameters i e length and location depend on aquifer conditions i e characterized by transverse dispersivity inland hydraulic heads and aquifer thickness when evaluating the effectiveness of fully penetrating barriers in reducing the extent of seawater intrusion and are independent of aquifer conditions when assessing the effectiveness of fully penetrating barriers in enhancing the maximum safe extraction rate these results offer valuable guidance and strategies for the design of engineered subsurface barriers the analytical methodology developed in this study is expected to provide a useful tool for evaluating the changes of seawater extent and safe extraction rate in head controlled coastal aquifers that are caused by the addition of fully penetrating finite length subsurface barriers in addition the developed methodology is also expected to be extended to the conceptualization of other factors such as layered aquifers multi well systems and multiple barriers broadening the

1898,previous 3d studies on the effectiveness of subsurface barriers against seawater intrusion in coastal aquifers have been largely limited to numerical models lacking analytical methods that are easy to implement and computationally efficient this study presents an analytical methodology based on the schwartz christoffel conformal mapping method and the potential theory for predicting the extent of seawater intrusion and the maximum safe extraction rate of a single well in a head controlled rectangular coastal aquifer with the addition of a subsurface physical barrier the barrier is assumed to fully penetrate the aquifer depth and has a finite length in the shore parallel direction consistency between analytical and numerical results highlights the capability of the proposed method to predict the steady state toe position and the maximum safe extraction rate the sensitivity analysis indicates that for a given barrier length the optimal barrier location i e distance to the coastline depends on the aquifer conditions i e dispersivity hydraulic gradient and the thickness of the aquifer in terms of the effectiveness of fully penetrating barriers in reducing the extent of seawater intrusion whereas the fully penetrating barriers that are longer and closer to the extraction well are always more effective in enhancing the maximum safe extraction rate independent of aquifer conditions the presented methodology provides a simple analytical tool for first order assessment of seawater wedge extents and safe extraction rates in response to engineered barriers in coastal aquifers serving as an alternative to 3d numerical modeling keywords subsurface barrier coastal aquifer conformal mapping seawater intrusion groundwater extraction data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction the management of fresh groundwater resources in coastal aquifers is often challenged by seawater intrusion a worldwide problem that is mainly caused by overexploitation and could be exacerbated by sea level rise werner et al 2013 various strategies have been proposed to prevent seawater intrusion and to enhance the freshwater storage in coastal aquifers including artificial freshwater replenishment mahesha 1996 lu et al 2017 shi et al 2020 saltwater extraction pool and carrera 2010 masciopinto 2013 ebeling et al 2019 stein et al 2020 compressed air injection dror et al 2004 sun and semprich 2013 aquifer hydraulic conductivity modification strack et al 2016 lu et al 2019 and subsurface physical barriers luyun et al 2009 abdoulhalik and ahmed 2017 li et al 2018 zheng et al 2020 the effectiveness of the subsurface physical barrier in controlling seawater intrusion and enhancing freshwater storage has long been investigated oude essink 2001 werner et al 2013 most of previous studies on this topic were based on 2d models i e shore perpendicular cross sectional representations of the aquifer where subsurface barriers were assumed to fully cover the entire width of the aquifer in the shore parallel direction e g sugio et al 1987 mahesha 2009 however existing engineered subsurface barriers usually adopt finite lengths due to cost limitations and construction constraints japan green resources agency 2004 for example subsurface barriers to prevent seawater intrusion in coastal aquifers in japan were reported to have finite lengths mostly in the range of 74 m to 550 m parallel to the coastline japan green resources agency 2004 in china the lengths of subsurface barriers constructed in coastal aquifers were reported to be between 545 m and 6 000 m shi and jiao 2014 therefore from a more realistic perspective a 3d analysis of the effectiveness of existing subsurface barriers would be more applicable despite the importance very few 3d investigations of subsurface barriers in coastal aquifers are available to the best of our knowledge only kaleris and ziogas 2013 and wu et al 2020a used 3d numerical models both considering a conceptual rectangular coastal aquifer to analyze the effectiveness of the subsurface barrier in preventing seawater intrusion and enhancing safe extraction rate i e the pumping rate without leading to the salinization of a single well kaleris and ziogas 2013 demonstrated that the effectiveness of subsurface barriers in enhancing safe extraction rates increased in wider aquifers wu et al 2020a found that barrier benefits may be significantly overestimated when ignoring the effect of the shore parallel length of the barrier these studies i e kaleris and ziogas 2013 wu et al 2020a highlighted the necessity of 3d analysis when evaluating subsurface barrier effectiveness furthermore previous investigations on coastal physical barriers largely employed numerical and experimental models e g kaleris and ziogas 2013 chang et al 2019 zheng et al 2021 though the results from the two models can characterize the mixing between freshwater and seawater they are constrained by either the significant computational cost or the spatial scale and thus have limited broader scale predictive capabilities to avoid these issues analytical approaches based on the sharp interface assumption have been frequently employed to conduct first order assessments for seawater intrusion extent and well pumping in coastal aquifers without physical barriers strack 1976 lu et al 2012 shi et al 2020 to date however only anwar 1983 derived an analytical solution for the sharp interface location under the effect of a subsurface barrier in a 2d unconfined coastal aquifer given the necessity of 3d investigations of subsurface barriers in coastal aquifers e g kaleris and ziogas 2013 wu et al 2020a analytical solutions for determining the extent of saltwater intrusion and allowable freshwater extraction in 3d barrier embedded coastal aquifers are currently warranted this is also expected to broaden the applicability of the analytical method to the problems that were previously only possible using 3d numerical modeling in this work we present an analytical methodology capable of assessing the performance of a finite length barrier in reducing the seawater extent and enhancing the safe extraction rate in coastal aquifers the proposed methodology combines the schwartz christoffel sc conformal mapping method and potential theory where the sc mapping is applied to facilitate the application of potential theory e g hunt 1985a hunt 1985b lu et al 2015 the applicability and robustness of the methodology are subsequently validated against variable density flow numerical simulations the methodology developed in our study has the potential to be a simple analytical tool for evaluating the subsurface barrier effectiveness in combating seawater intrusion in coastal aquifers 2 conceptual model fig 1 shows a conceptual model of a rectangular coastal aquifer including both unconfined fig 1b and confined scenarios fig 1c as shown in fig 1a the idealized coastal aquifer i e homogeneous isotropic uniform geometry has a rectangular domain in the plane view with dimensions l length w width the uniform thickness of the confined aquifer is denoted as b fig 1c the seaside and landside are respectively represented by specified head boundary conditions of the seawater head h s and the freshwater head h f above the horizontal aquifer base while the lateral boundaries are impermeable i e no flow the freshwater and seawater densities are œÅ f and œÅ s respectively with corresponding salt concentrations of c f and c s as shown in fig 1a the x and y axes coincide with the centerline of the domain width and the shoreline respectively with the origin at the point where the x and y axes intersect the freshwater piezometric level relative to the aquifer base is denoted as h f x y a fully penetrating impermeable barrier with a finite length l b is placed parallel to the coast at a distance d b x w from the coastline a fully penetrating well that pumps groundwater from the aquifer at a rate q is located at a distance x w from the coastline the conceptual model is symmetrical about the shore perpendicular axis i e x axis that passes through both the middle of the barrier and the center of the extraction well fig 1a two different scenarios are considered including a barrier only i e the aquifer contains a physical barrier without pumping and b barrier well i e the aquifer contains both a physical barrier and a pumping well systems the seawater wedge toe position and the maximum safe pumping rate i e the critical pumping rate without causing salinization of the single well are analyzed in the barrier only and the barrier well systems respectively 3 methodology 3 1 assumptions to facilitate the development of the analytical methodology the following assumptions are adopted e g lu and luo 2014 lu et al 2017 1 the system is under steady state where land surface processes e g evapotranspiration and recharge and transient processes of the boundary e g fluctuation tide and wave effect are neglected 2 the sharp interface assumption is adopted i e neglecting the mixing between freshwater and saltwater 3 the dupuit forchheimer approximation is introduced to eliminate the resistance to the vertical flow 4 the ghyben herzberg relation is adopted for determining the interface toe position moreover two zones separated by the interface toe are formed i e zone 1 containing the interface and zone 2 of the remainder of the aquifer fig 1 in this study we consider a head controlled system i e the aquifer with a constant head inland boundary as representatives of coastal aquifers involving river lake etc which have also been employed in previous studies of seawater intrusion e g lu et al 2012 lu and luo 2014 such head controlled systems are often distinguished from flux controlled systems i e aquifers with a constant flux inland boundary nonetheless lu et al 2012 demonstrated that different inland boundary conditions i e constant head and constant flux led to minor deviations in the maximum pumping rate of a single well when the aquifer dimension in shore perpendicular direction is greater than five times the distance between the extraction well and the coastline 3 2 mathematical derivation given the dupuit approximation and the ghyben herzberg relation the potential function —Ñ proposed by strack 1976 is applicable to the solution domain for an unconfined coastal aquifer —Ñ can be written as strack 1976 1 zone 1 œÜ k 2 1 1 Œµ h f h s 2 2 zone 2 œÜ k 2 h f 2 1 Œµ h s 2 in which k is the aquifer hydraulic conductivity and …õ is the density ratio defined as œÅ s œÅ f œÅ f for a confined coastal aquifer —Ñ can be expressed as strack 1976 3 zone 1 œÜ k 2 Œµ h f Œµ b Œµ 1 h s 2 4 zone 2 œÜ k b h f 1 2 k Œµ b 2 Œµ 1 k b h s according to the definition of potential flow —Ñ satisfies 5 2 œÜ x 2 2 œÜ y 2 0 eq 5 holds everywhere in the solution domain except at the well point x w 0 hunt 1985a in addition for an unconfined coastal aquifer —Ñ satisfies the following boundary conditions 6 œÜ y 0 x y on lateral no flow boundary 7 œÜ 0 x y on sea boundary 8 œÜ k 2 h f 2 1 Œµ h s 2 x y on inland boundary where eqs 7 and 8 are based on eqs 1 and 2 for a confined coastal aquifer eq 6 is also applicable while eqs 7 and 8 should be replaced according to eqs 3 and 4 by 9 œÜ Œµ k 2 h s b 2 x y on sea boundary 10 œÜ k b h f 1 2 k Œµ b 2 Œµ 1 k b h s x y on inland boundary however the solution of equations 5 8 for unconfined coastal aquifers or eqs 5 6 9 and 10 for confined coastal aquifers cannot be directly derived because the fully penetrating barrier functions as an internal no flow boundary i e blocking flow perpendicular to the barrier fig 1 producing a multiply connected domain to address this the model domain is simplified according to symmetry and the sc mapping method is introduced to reduce the complexity of the boundary geometry as explained below fig 2 shows different aquifer domain scenarios including the z plane representing the real domain showing the boundary scenarios corresponding to fig 1a and the w plane representing the image domain showing the desired boundary scenarios where the solution to the problem defined above i e eqs 5 8 or eqs 5 6 9 and 10 can be easily derived specifically fig 2a shows the boundary condition scenario consistent with fig 1a where symmetry allows only the upper half of the model domain to be analyzed fig 2b shows a representative view of a special case where the barrier and the coastline coincide the main difficulty is how to map the bounded polygons in fig 2a and 2b onto the interior of a rectangle bounded by two parallel constant head boundaries and two parallel impermeable boundaries i e fig 2c and 2d respectively it should be noted that the number of vertices required to obtain a corrected inverse mapping i e mapping the w plane upon the z plane is different for the scenarios of fig 2c and 2d the transformations between the z and w planes can be achieved by the application of sc transformation in the forms 11 w f z mapping the z plane upon the w plane 12 z g w mapping the w plane upon the z plane where z x iy w u iv and i is the imaginary unit generally the exact form of the sc mapping formula i e eqs 11 and 12 cannot be derived analytically for the mapping with more than four vertices e g the scenarios shown in fig 2a and 2b as an alternative the sc toolbox for achieving sc mapping and its inverse numerically incorporated into matlab developed by driscoll 1994 is applied to achieve the transformations between the z and w planes for example the rectmap function of the sc toolbox can easily implement the mapping from the bounded polygon interior in the z plane upon a rectangle interior in the w plane i e solving eq 11 and its inverse can be determined by the evalinv function i e solving eq 12 applying the symmetry again it can be further assumed that fig 2c or 2d represents the upper half of an otherwise fully bounded rectangular aquifer of geometry l length along the u axis w width along the v axis which is similar to the coastal aquifer setting illustrated in fig 1a but without a physical barrier that is by performing the sc mapping the problem is simplified to examine the maximum safe pumping rate of a single well in a rectangular coastal aquifer where the internal boundary i e the impermeable barrier is eliminated note that l and w can be determined by vertices positions in the w plane lu and luo 2014 derived the analytical solution for the interface toe position and the maximum safe pumping rate of a single well located in a fully bounded rectangular coastal aquifer i e the scenarios shown in fig 2c or 2d based on the potential theory and the image well superposition method the assumptions undertaken in their investigation are consistent with those adopted in the current study e g steady state sharp interface assumption such that their analytical solutions can be directly used for the scenarios shown in fig 2c or 2d for the sake of brevity only the expressions for determining the seawater wedge toe position i e z toe and the maximum safe pumping rate i e q m are given below the derivation process of which is summarized in text s1 see the supplementary material the reader is also referred to lu and luo 2014 for detailed mathematical derivation 3 2 1 scenario a seawater wedge toe position for unconfined and confined aquifers without pumping i e scenario a barrier only system the toe position of seawater wedge in the w plane only with respect to the u axis i e u toe can be respectively determined by lu and luo 2014 13 unconfined u toe Œµ Œµ 1 l h s 2 h f 2 Œµ 1 h s 2 14 confined u toe Œµ b l 2 h f Œµ 1 h s Œµ b the toe position obtained in the w plane can be expressed by a complex variable as 15 w toe u toe i v toe in which v toe represents the toe position along the v axis note that v toe for scenario a can be an arbitrary value in the range of w 2 to w 2 once the toe position in the w plane i e w toe is determined the corresponding toe position in the z plane i e z toe defined as x toe iy toe can be easily obtained by eq 12 that can be solved numerically using evalinv function of the sc toolbox 3 2 2 scenario b maximum safe pumping rate for the barrier well system the pumping rate q in the w plane is related to the stagnation point of the extraction well u s and the toe position u toe at the model center i e v 0 which is respectively given as lu and luo 2014 16 q 4 œÄ œÜ toe q f u toe l m ln cosh œÄ m w cos œÄ u toe u w cosh œÄ m w cos œÄ u toe u w 17 q 4 q f l m sin œÄ u s u w cosh œÄ m w cos œÄ u s u w sin œÄ u s u w cosh œÄ m w cos œÄ u s u w where the potential at the toe position œÜ toe and the freshwater groundwater discharge q f are defined for unconfined and confined coastal aquifers respectively as lu and luo 2014 18 unconfined œÜ toe Œµ Œµ 1 2 k h s 2 q f k 2 l h f 2 Œµ 1 h s 2 19 confined œÜ toe Œµ 2 k b 2 q f kb 2 l 2 h f 2 Œµ 1 h s Œµ b the well location in the w plane u w can be determined once its location in the z plane x w is given the theoretical maximum safe pumping rate q m for scenario b is achieved when u s coincides with u toe at v 0 e g strack 1976 lu and luo 2014 accordingly q m can be calculated by an iterative procedure combining eqs 16 and 17 as suggested by lu and luo 2014 it should be noted that q m has the same value in the w plane and its inverse plane i e the z plane because the stagnation point of the extraction well z s and the toe position x toe at the model center i e y 0 must coincide in the z plane if the corresponding u s coincides with u toe in the w plane 3 3 correction factor the analytical solution derived based on the assumption of the sharp freshwater seawater interface is known to overestimate the state steady toe position and underestimate the maximum safe pumping rate compared to numerical simulations that include the mixing effect between freshwater and seawater to eliminate this discrepancy between analytical results and the numerical simulation results pool and carrera 2011 proposed an empirical correction factor based on the density ratio 20 Œµ Œµ 1 Œ± t b 1 6 1 where …õ is the corrected density ratio eq 20 is determined and examined merely for the maximum safe pumping rate of a single well located in the flux controlled system i e the aquifer with a constant flux inland boundary whereas for the head controlled system considered in the current study lu and werner 2013 found that the correction factor proposed by pool and carrera 2011 i e eq 20 should be modified to 21 Œµ Œµ 1 Œ± t b 1 4 1 it is found that the analytical solution corrected by eq 21 can well reproduce the numerical toe position i e indicated by 0 1 isochlor in the head controlled coastal aquifer lu and werner 2013 this representative value i e 0 1 isochlor generally leads to a more landward toe position than other commonly used values e g 0 5 and 0 9 isochlors thereby providing a more conservative assessment of seawater intrusion nonetheless the applicability of eq 21 for the maximum safe extraction rate has not been validated a systematic evaluation of the correction factor is beyond the aims of this study here we focus on two correction factors that are often employed in previous studies i e eqs 20 and 21 the predicted maximum safe extraction rate in the head controlled system is corrected using both eqs 20 and 21 and compared to the corresponding numerical results see fig s1 supplementary material fig s1 highlights the applicability of eq 21 to head controlled systems therefore eq 21 is introduced as the correction factor in the current study 3 4 dimensionless parameters and quantitative indicators to eliminate dimension effects dimensionless parameters are introduced according to the dimensionless analysis presented in previous works i e lu et al 2012 kaleris and ziogas 2013 lu and luo 2014 that is the parameters with a unit of length e g x y z toe w h f and h s or volumetric flow rate e g q m are normalized by x w or x w q f respectively in the current study the dimensionless variables are labeled by a superscript star e g x z t o e and q m in scenario a the toe positions before z t o e 0 and after z t o e 1 barrier construction are calculated and compared to quantify the effectiveness of the barriers in reducing the extent of seawater intrusion the relative change in the toe position across the width of the aquifer i e Œ¥ s t o e is introduced as 22 Œ¥ s toe y w 2 w 2 z toe0 z toe1 d x y w 2 w 2 z toe0 d x obviously greater Œ¥ s t o e values indicate the barriers that are more effective in reducing the seawater intrusion extent in scenario b the maximum safe pumping rates before q m 0 and after q m 1 the barrier construction are determined the relative change in the maximum safe pumping rate is given as 23 Œ¥ q m q m1 q m0 q m0 where a larger Œ¥ q m indicates a better performance of the barrier in enhancing the maximum safe pumping rate 4 numerical validation numerical simulation is often applied to validate analytical methods e g lu et al 2016 wu et al 2020b jazayeri et al 2020 in this study numerical simulation is conducted using seawat 2000 a program designed to simulate 3d variable

Œ¥ z 2 the current discretization yields pe m 1 6 satisfying eq 24 the time step Œ¥t is set to 2 5 days and the courant number c r is 1 the total simulation time is 120 000 days sufficient to obtain steady state conditions for all tested cases the impermeable barrier is simulated as the internal no flow boundary the barrier thickness coincides with the cell size in the x direction i e 2 5 m and the barrier height is consistent with the model height i e 20 m in scenario a the physical barrier is designed to exclude seawater on the landward side of the barrier to be consistent with eq 21 the toe position obtained from numerical simulations is defined as the point where 0 1 isochlor intersects with the aquifer base selected barrier lengths i e 400 m 800 m 1200 m and 1600 m and locations i e 0 m 100 m and 200 m are tested in scenario a all barriers are placed within the initial seawater wedge toe position i e 243 2 m prior to the barrier condition for seawater intrusion exclusion the dimensionless values of barrier parameters are given in table 2 in scenario b we consider a single well fixed at x w 500 m the simulated barrier lengths in scenario b are consistent with those of scenario a while more barrier locations i e 0 m 100 m 200 m 300 m and 400 m are simulated in scenario b q m is examined under various settings of the barrier which is determined as that causes the average salinity of the pumped water under steady state to reach an allowable salinity limit i e 0 1 of seawater as suggested by pool and carrera 2011 in numerical simulations an observation well is placed at the well site to monitor whether the average salinity in the well column was constant in time and had reached the predefined threshold q m can be obtained by repeatedly running the model and modifying pumping i e trial and error optimization wu et al 2020a to quantitatively assess the accuracy of analytical predictions we define the relative maximum safe pumping rate difference i e Œ∑ as 25 Œ∑ q m ana q m num q m num 100 where the second subscript i e ana and num represents q m obtained from the analytical and the numerical approach respectively obviously a lower absolute value of Œ∑ indicates a more accurate analytical prediction of q m 4 2 results fig 3 shows the comparison between the analytical and the numerical z t o e for scenario a where various barrier settings i e different combinations of l b and d b and the no barrier case are considered as shown in fig 3 the barrier reduces the extent of saltwater in all tested cases where the analytical z t o e hollow circles shows reasonable agreement with the numerical z t o e solid lines both numerical and analytical z t o e indicate similar trends as l b or d b increases that is for l b 1 6 the barrier placed closer to the shore i e smaller d b leads to more seaward z t o e fig 3a except for the case with d b 0 2 where z t o e values indicated in blue are found to be slight seaward of z t o e values of the case with d b 0 indicated in red in the regions adjacent to the barrier edge i e y l b 2 0 8 this phenomenon occurs because the seaward freshwater flow blocked by the impermeable barrier of d b 0 2 is concentrated to the edge of the barrier which pushes the seawater wedge toe further back in addition the longer barrier i e larger l b produces more seaward z t o e for the case with d b 0 fig 3b as expected where barriers with l b 1 6 cause the toe to intersect with the impermeable barrier indicating a significant reduction in the seawater wedge extent whereas for the barrier with l b 0 8 z t o e still stays on its landward side the magenta line in fig 3b this outcome suggests that for relatively short barriers seawater may bypass its edges and thus seawater wedge upstream of the barrier cannot be effectively removed the analytical and the numerical q m and corresponding Œ∑ values for scenario b are shown in fig 4 where various combinations of d b i e 0 0 2 0 4 0 6 and 0 8 and l b i e 0 8 1 6 2 4 and 3 2 are considered as shown in fig 4a the derived analytical solution generally well reproduces the numerical q m the relative differences between numerical simulations and analytical results i e Œ∑ have a maximum value of 9 9 which was obtained for the case with the longest barrier located along the coastline i e l b 3 2 and d b 0 fig 4b moreover unlike the impact on the interface toe when the barrier is closer to the well a larger q m is obtained fig 4b indicates that for the case with the short barrier e g l b 0 8 a relatively low value of Œ∑ i e Œ∑ 3 6 is obtained for any selected d b for l b 3 2 Œ∑ is large when d b 0 and 0 2 i e Œ∑ 9 9 and 9 8 respectively while Œ∑ remains relatively low i e Œ∑ 3 6 for d b 0 6 and 0 8 larger values of Œ∑ for d b 0 and 0 2 can be mainly attributed to the limitation of the numerical approximation of the sc mapping i e the well known crowding phenomenon driscoll 1994 crowding is a problem commonly encountered in the numerical sc mapping involving an elongated region and the problem is hard to be solved when the local aspect ratio i e l b d b exceeds about 20 driscoll 1994 that is a longer barrier placed at d b 0 2 gives rise to a larger local aspect ratio i e l b d b and thus may induce a greater error specially for d b 0 the increasing length of the barrier narrows the boundary ab see fig 2b where the crowding phenomenon becomes apparent 5 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis is conducted based on the proposed methodology to identify the effectiveness of the barrier under various aquifer conditions adapted from the base case table 1 focusing on the effect of different values of transverse dispersivity Œ± t inland hydraulic heads h f and aquifer thickness b three representative values of d b i e 0 0 2 and 0 4 are examined in scenario a in scenario b d b ranging from 0 2 to 0 8 are assessed l b in the range of 0 8 to 3 2 are evaluated in both scenarios a and b 5 1 scenario a barrier only system fig 5 shows the sensitivity of Œ¥ s t o e to l b and d b under various aquifer conditions including the cases of Œ± t 0 0002 0 0005 and 0 002 h f 0 0616 0 062 and 0 064 and b 0 02 0 04 and 0 06 as shown in fig 5 the impact of l b and d b on Œ¥ s t o e is dependent on the aquifer conditions for example in the scenarios of the smallest Œ± t i e 0 0002 the lowest h f i e 0 0616 or the largest b i e 0 02 a greater l b leads to a larger Œ¥ s t o e for a given d b a1 b1 and c3 of fig 5 as expected whereas the optimal d b that results in the largest Œ¥ s t o e depends on the specific barrier length that is for a relatively long barrier e g l b 3 2 the optimal d b is 0 while for a relatively short barrier e g l b 0 8 seawater may bypass the barrier edge when the barrier is close to the coastline reducing the barrier effectiveness as explained in fig 3 and thus the optimal d b is 0 2 e g fig 5 a1 or 0 4 e g fig 5 b1 and c3 in the scenarios of the largest Œ± t i e 0 002 the highest h f i e 0 064 or the smallest b i e 0 02 a lower d b leads to a larger Œ¥ s t o e for a given l b fig 5 a3 b3 and c1 whereas relationships between Œ¥ s t o e and l b are complex depending on d b that is for d b 0 Œ¥ s t o e increases with the increasing l b while for d b 0 4 a larger l b results in a lower negative value of Œ¥ s t o e fig 5 a3 b3 and c1 this outcome occurs because under the aquifer conditions of Œ± t 0 002 h f 0 064 or b 0 02 the barrier placed at d b 0 4 is more landward than z t o e 0 i e the initial seawater wedge toe position before the barrier construction and causes seawater to accumulate downstream of the barrier in addition Œ¥ s t o e may be a non monotonic function of l b e g d b 0 4 in fig 5 a2 and d b 0 2 in fig 5 b3 that is for a given d b the barrier may have an optimal l b that gives rise to a peak value of Œ¥ s t o e this non monotonic behavior of Œ¥ s t o e can be attributed to the re accumulation of seawater downstream of the barrier as the barrier length increases which is evidenced by z t o e shown in fig s2 see the supplementary material 5 2 scenario b barrier well system the sensitivity of Œ¥ q m to different l b and d b is shown in fig 6 the effectiveness of the barrier is examined under the base case i e Œ± t 0 0005 h f 0 062 and b 0 04 and the modified cases that use different Œ± t i e 0 0002 or 0 002 h f i e 0 0616 or 0 064 or b i e 0 02 or 0 06 as expected a barrier that is longer i e larger l b and closer to the well i e larger d b leads to a higher Œ¥ q m under all aquifer conditions that are considered fig 6 for a given l b and d b the barrier is found to perform optimally i e producing the largest Œ¥ q m when the aquifer has the smallest Œ± t the lowest h f or the greatest b as shown in fig 6 it should be noted that a low Œ¥ q m may not correspond to a small increament in q m as shown by sensitivity values of q m in fig s3 see the supplementary material for a given l b and d b the largest q m 0 and q m 1 are obtained in the aquifer with the greatest Œ± t the highest h f or the lowest b this occurs because the aquifer of greater Œ± t higher h f or lower b can lead to z t o e 0 that is more seaward thereby allowing a larger q m for a single well placed at a fixed distance to the coastline 6 discussion the results of this study indicate that seawater can bypass the edges of short barriers close to the shore reducing the effectiveness of the barrier in excluding seawater whereas for the barrier close to the initial toe position i e prior to the barrier construction a long barrier may cause the seawater to reaccumulate downstream of the barrier and thus are not as superior as shorter barriers fig s2 this nuances the previous 3d investigation of wu et al 2020a who found that a longer fully penetrating barrier should achieve a greater reduction of the seawater intrusion extent clearly a comprehensive analysis of a wide range of barrier lengths and locations under various aquifer conditions which however is often unfordable in 3d numerical models provides important insights into the ideal positioning of fully penetrating barriers previous studies e g kaleris and ziogas 2013 wu et al 2020a have demonstrated that the type of coastal aquifers i e confined or unconfined has little effect on determining the effectiveness of the subsurface barriers provided that the thickness of the confined aquifer is comparable to that of the corresponding unconfined aquifer i e confined aquifers of a confining layer at the sea level see fig 1c can represent unconfined aquifers confined aquifers are defined in their numerical models as approximations of unconfined aquifers to reduce computational costs nonetheless this approximation has only been validated under a few numerical model scenarios e g kaleris and ziogas 2013 a systematic comparison of the barrier effectiveness in unconfined and confined coastal aquifers can be easily performed based on the proposed methodology see examples given in figs s4 and s5 in the supplementary material the results in figs s4 and s5 highlight the accuracy of the approximation at least for the parameter values used in the current study where the toe positions obtained in unconfined and confined aquifers almost coincide and the difference in Œ¥ q m is less than 0 8 in the current study predictions using the proposed methodology are largely consistent with numerical simulations the errors in the predicted maximum safe pumping rate fig 4 are attributable to the inclusion of the correction factor i e eq 21 and the crowding problem whereas the difference caused by the correction factor is negligible i e Œ∑ 1 4 1 1 fig s1b in the supplementary material the main errors are induced by the numerical approximation of the sc mapping using the sc toolbox in matlab i e causing the crowding problem methods that can better solve this problem e g using higher precision arithmetic and more accurate numerical methods for the sc mapping can be further incorporated into the presented methodology which is expected to improve prediction accuracy but at the expense of computational cost e g driscoll 2005 the empirical correction factor i e eq 21 is introduced to involve the mixing effect such that predicted toe positions and maximum safe extraction rates are associated with the specific salinity values this not only facilitates the validation of the proposed methodology against numerical modeling but also yields insights into the application of the proposed analytical based method as an alternative to the 3d numerical model in addition these representative values of salinity are in accordance with previous studies e g 0 1 isochlor toe position by lu and werner 2013 and 0 1 mixed seawater threshold of the maximum safe pumping rate by pool and carrera 2011 which are expected to provide relatively conservative strategies for groundwater management of barrier embedded coastal aquifers wu et al 2020a furthermore other factors that are not included in the current study such as layered aquifers multi well systems and multiple barriers can also be conceptualized by the developed methodology for example previous analytical solutions of seawater intrusion in layered coastal aquifers e g strack and ausk 2015 rathore et al 2018 rathore et al 2020 or multi well systems e g mantoglou 2003 mantoglou et al 2004 shi et al 2020 are applicable to the image domains of rectangular shape see fig 2 similar problems associated with real domains with the addition of subsurface barriers see fig 2 can be solved accordingly by applying the sc mapping method nonetheless the horizontal flow nature of the current methodology precludes the analysis of other processes with non negligible variability in the vertical direction such as partially penetrating barriers or extraction wells which warrant further investigations 7 conclusions in this study we propose an analytical methodology for quantifying the steady state seawater wedge toe position and the maximum safe extraction rate of a single well in head controlled coastal aquifers with the addition of a finite length fully penetrating barrier the analytical solutions generally well reproduce the shape interface locations and the allowable extraction rates obtained from the numerical model the sensitivity analysis shows that the optimal barrier parameters i e length and location depend on aquifer conditions i e characterized by transverse dispersivity inland hydraulic heads and aquifer thickness when evaluating the effectiveness of fully penetrating barriers in reducing the extent of seawater intrusion and are independent of aquifer conditions when assessing the effectiveness of fully penetrating barriers in enhancing the maximum safe extraction rate these results offer valuable guidance and strategies for the design of engineered subsurface barriers the analytical methodology developed in this study is expected to provide a useful tool for evaluating the changes of seawater extent and safe extraction rate in head controlled coastal aquifers that are caused by the addition of fully penetrating finite length subsurface barriers in addition the developed methodology is also expected to be extended to the conceptualization of other factors such as layered aquifers multi well systems and multiple barriers broadening the

1899,in this study the effect of the floodplain s parallel wall with a compound meandering main channel over the hydraulics flow has been analyzed experimentally a constant sinuosity factor of 1 3 and relative flow depths of 0 3 to 0 55 were considered to illustrate the effect of the hydraulic parameters on the variations of the velocity components velocity components were measured by adv velocimeter at seven cross sections with angles of zero 30 and 60 degrees and mesh size of 2 cm 2 cm furthermore a laser meter measured the topographies of the sediment bed in the 33 cross sections with an angle difference of 5 degrees to the bend apex the results showed that in lower relative depths due to vortexes and high turbulence intensity the ability of flood damage will be more eminent the cs04 section with the least longitudinal and transverse changes in the water level is the best position for hydraulic investigation of the meandering rivers the left bank in sections cs03 to cs07 will be the place of deposit of sediment in nature with the formation of the stagnation area the velocity of ud fp inner is 3 to 5 times higher than ud fp outer for this cause the flow in the outer bank unlike the inner bank has a reduced effect on the flow velocity in the main channel increasing the relative depth the ratio ud mc ud t and ud fp ud t decreased and increased respectively therefore the average velocity values in the main channel and the floodplains reached the average velocity of the whole section the flow velocity in the main channel is always higher than in the floodplains and the ratio ud fp ud mc is less than one the variation trend in the average values of bed shear stress turbulence kinetic energy tke and average kinetic energy mke was decreased with increasing relative flow depth both factors of relative depth and froude number will affect the location of the occurrence of the maximum values of velocity bed shear stress maximum depth hole and the peak of the sedimentary hill keywords river bend momentum transmission turbulent flow compound meandering channel sediment transport data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction as we can see in nature the deepest part of the rivers thalweg line takes on a meandering pattern in the longitudinal path which has caused the rivers to don t have a straight route and a simple cross section in the long routes therefore the formation and evolution of natural river morphology are frequently characterized by a compound cross section and meandering pattern during floods the floodplains in compound cross sections are essential in controlling and transporting excess flow and sediment yield downstream schumm and khan 1972 hence it is essential to pay attention to the unique hydraulic conditions that distinguish compound sections from regular and simple sections much research has been done on compound channels to date e g knight and demetriou 1983 pasche and rouv√© 1985 patra et al 2004 the results showed there is a significant difference in the flow depth and roughness of the main channel and the floodplains of a compound section the occurrence of a high velocity difference at the intersection of these two areas by increasing factors such as energy exchange the strength of the secondary flow strong lateral shear layers and energy loss reduces the flow through the channel as shown by sellin 1964 ferreira da silva 2006 yang et al 2007 shan et al 2017 liu et al 2021 li et al 2021 the velocity distribution in the cross section of an open channel is complicated and varies from one location to another because of the flow surface turbulence and the bed s shear stress maghrebi and givehchi 2009 three analytical models were extracted to determine the flow rate through simple s channels as well as symmetric and asymmetric compound channels liao and knight 2007 the turbulent pattern of the flow in the trapezoidal compound section straight path indicated when floodplain vegetation with density 0 œÜ 0 0314 is present the channel capacity rate is up to 31 lower than when there is non vegetation hamidifar and omid 2013 rozovskii 1957 was the first to investigate the flow structure in the river bend in the following by analyzing the flow hydraulics in the meanderingcompoundchannel it is possible to see that energy loss increases noticeably when the flow depth is greater than the level of the main channel toebes and sooky 1967 three dimensional modelling showed that flow turbulence in meandering compound channels is more complex than a straight path this phenomenon occurs due to high momentum exchange transverse hydrostatic pressure gradient and the effect of centrifugal force rozovskii 1957 rameshwaran and naden 2004 was afterwards explored experimentally and numerically by several scholars e g yalin 1992 blanckaert and graf 2001 wormleaton et al 2005 crosato 2008 esfahani and keshavarzi 2011 yang et al 2013 kordi et al 2015 engel and rhoads 2016 farzadkhoo 2019 randle 2020 taye and kumar 2021 naghavi et al 2023 they reported that the centrifugal force is the principal force infused into the flow in the river bend and that secondary flow originates from its interaction with the lateral hydrostatic pressure gradient checking the water level on convex and concave sides of a channel bend was done by installing a guide wall for three radii downslope and discharge in supercritical flow conditions the results showed that after installing the guide wall the froude number fr becomes smaller and even less than 1 0 also the water depth in the convex bank decreased with the decrease of the relative axial radius the water level difference in the sides of the sections decreases with the decrease in flow rate per unit of width or downslope zhang et al 2019 for uniform flow in a straight rectangular channel the logarithmic law of velocity distribution and the flow turbulence parameter were measured steffler et al 1985 based on field measurements conducted by engel and rhoads 2017 the depth averaged velocity distribution in a river bend unlike in a straight path is not logarithmic also the velocity in the outer bend is greater than the inner bend sukhodolov and kaschtschejewa 2010 whereas this is not always the case the results reported by de vriend and geldof 1983 showed that if the bend angle is sharp the speed in the inner bend is higher than the outer bend sui et al 2006 assessed the effect of the froude number of the entering flow on the secondary flow formation power and erosive power in the 90 degree arch of open channels the velocity distribution in the meandering channel indicated that the highest velocity values occurred at the bending apexes and were extended to deflection angles of 40 and even 60 degrees roca et al 2007 the formation mechanism of secondary flow in the main channel was reported to be different and with a larger concentration core than in floodplains it was stated that the reason for this phenomenon is the effect of a larger centrifugal force in the main channel shiono et al 1999 the secondary flow in the channel s bend was described as two vortex cells blanckaert and graf 2001 so that one of them is on the central axis and the other is near the outer bend with smaller eddies which is important to the erosion of the bed and walls the dimensionless ratio b h is linked to the quantity and shape of secondary flow cells patnaik et al 2014 b is the width channel and h is the water level by investigating the effect of the parallel of the meandering main channel with the floodplain wall on the hydraulics flow it was shown that the reynolds stress u w near the bed of the main channel had reached the maximum and positive values and moving away from the bed it was reached a negative value s and was showed its minimum amount near the flow surface moradi et al 2022 the transverse distribution of secondary flow in a meandering compound channel with mobile and fixed beds will be different due to the formation of the bed form in the mobile state shiono et al 2009 ibrahim et al 2016 shan et al 2017 the secondary flow and eddies created across the channel have a substantial impact on the prediction of velocity distribution and bed shear stress tang and knight 2015 in the bend of meandering rivers the secondary flow may have a significant effect on the lateral distribution of many hydraulic and morphological parameters such as flow velocity bed shear stress and sediment transport capacity tang and knight 2015 a change in the distribution of bed shear stress causes a significant change in the river s morphology such as bed erosion and sedimentation areas chen et al 2012 armanini and cavedon 2019 the pattern of erosion and sedimentation is not the same for any of the sinusoidal channels with large and small angles but by using the convergence and divergence of the streamlines from the centre line of the channel and creating a stagnation line it is possible to predict the probable region of erosion and sedimentation in the case of a mobile bed yalin and da silva 2001 the effect of changing the width to depth ratio b h was investigated using four different flow rates on the bed topography in a sinusoidal channel with an angle of 55 degrees the result indicates that increasing the flow rate and depth increases the height of the sediment hill and scour hole it also causes the movement of the region with high shear stress to the downstream side of the channel hooke 1975 the change of manning s friction coefficient was experimentally investigated based on the measurement of depth averaged velocity and bed shear stress in several different models of the channel cross section geometry khuntia et al 2016 the cause of the radial movement of sediment particles across the bend of the meandering channel was related to the significant difference in velocity and consequently the shear stress in the inner and outer bend esfahani and keshavarzis 2011 in the inner bend of the meandering river where the maximum velocity of the flow prevails scouring was also reported with maximum values the maximum shear stress on the banks of the channel indicates the high momentum of the flow in these areas where the processes of erosion and sedimentation are dominant keshavarzi et al 2016 previous literature attempted to find the effects of composite cross section on the flow structure in open channels with straight walls of the floodplain while most of the time the natural morphology of rivers can be seen with meandering patterns and compound sections therefore we intend to evaluate the interactions between hydraulic flow sediment transport and the meandering compound channel that were rarely studied the main contribution of this paper is to investigate the effect of the parallel wall of the floodplains and the meandering main channel on the hydraulic flow structure bed morphology in a sinuous bend and sediment flux downstream that is focused on the effect of different relative depths and froude numbers 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup laboratory meandering flume with a rectangular cross section was used with 7 36 m curve length 0 46 m width 0 48 m height and sinuosity coefficient of 1 3 in 4 5 consecutive bends fig 1 a in order to create a compound cross section a wide 0 15 m and high 0 14 m staircase was made symmetrically on both sides the ratio of the width floodplain to the main channel bfp bmc 1 and the longitudinal slope of 0 0012 were considered constant fig 1 b shows further details of the meandering compound channel with the equipment and section measurement location the geometric characteristics of the experimental meandering channel and the parallel details of the side walls were achieved based on mohanta and patra 2019 table 1 and fig 2 a three dimensional instantaneous velocity components in streamwise u radial v vertical directions w and velocity fluctuations u v w were measured by an acoustic doppler velocimeter adv the sampling frequency in all tests and for the duration time 60 s was measured at 25 hz the average flow velocities u v w were calculated from the average of 1500 instantaneous velocity data for each point all the reported data were screened and validated by using win adv software with a limited signal to noise ratio snr and correlation coefficient cor of greater than 15 db and 70 respectively sontek 1997 the recorded average snr values ranged from 24 to 26 with a cor of 80 98 velocity data were measured at 1953 grid points in 7 cross sections cs01 cs07 with angles of zero 30 and 60 degrees to the bend apex fig 1 b generally data was measured with a mesh grid of 2 cm 2 cm and 1 cm 1 cm in the common area of the main channel and flood plain respectively fig 2 b the flow velocity components in the three directions of x y and z in cs02 to cs06 sections were converted from cartesian into curvilinear coordinates in cs01 and cs07 sections the coordinates axis was considered with a cartesian condition uniform graded sediment was used with a median diameter d50 of 1 19 mm and a standard deviation Œ¥ g d 75 d 25 of 1 38 in the experiments as a result of no changes in bed level during the test and achieved equilibrium bed at 4 25 hr was measured the topography of the bed the duration of experimental tests to achieve similar equilibrium conditions by keshavarzi et al 2016 ranged from 6 to 12 h a gap with an opening of 0 03 m across the channel was used to measure the amount of sediment flux downstream this gap was leveled with the height of 0 14 m for mobile bed sediment at the beginning of each experiment to fulfil the measurements a monitoring system was manufactured including an electric motor and a rectangular frame 0 85 m 0 68 m sectioned into 17 rectangular subsections the subsections of the frame were covered by a fine meshed net in the shape of small bags to capture sediments at the outlet at each run of the experiment sediments required 4 25 hr to achieve equilibrium with the maximum water flow therefore all experiments were run for 4 25 hr during which each bag captured the sediments for about 15 min fig 2 c a digital point gauge with a tolerance of 0 5 mm was used and the topography of the bed sediment was measured at 759 grid points in 33 cross sections cs01 cs33 with an angle difference of 5 degrees relative to each other the volumetric flow rate was calibrated with frequency values of the inverter device to the range of 5 4 61 1 lit s m total channel width is 0 46 m an end gate was used to control the relative flow depth ranges of 0 3 0 55 to establish the steady flow dr h h h h and h are the main channel water depth and floodplain height respectively fourteen rulers were attached given that the flow depth is different on both sides of the flood wall at any section due to curve sketch and centrifugal force according to the recommendation by tominaga et al 1989 in order to avoid the affection of the upstream and downstream boundary conditions on the flow characteristics the data measurement range was considered at a distance of 3 2 m 3l 2 from the beginning of the flume due to the similarity of the flow pattern and sediment transport at a full wavelength of the channel Œª 1 6 m the data were measured at half a wavelength 2 2 scale effects besides hydraulic analysis approaches physical modelling is the oldest tool for simulating flow dynamics in hydraulic engineering free surface flows are typically scaled by the froude number simulation which is the same in both the model and the prototype fr v gh 0 5 if the reynolds number similarity applies the froude number may lead to non negligible scale effects therefore the effect of gravity on the fluid flow should be negligible in the reynolds model torres et al 2018 because the reynolds number in most real scale flows is both turbulent and in the hydraulically rough regime the differences in results are independent of r e g moody diagram flows in hydraulic froude models are often shifted to the hydraulic rough regime to better account for losses therefore the sediment transport in models is affected by scale effects because the internal flow turbulence defined by the reynolds number re vh ŒΩ is underestimated while surface tension defined by the weber number we œÅv2h œÉ is overestimated chanson 2009 no model with weber number similarity was ever built based on le m√©haut√© 2013 and w may always be a source of scale effects surface tension is negligible for most prototypes in hydraulic engineering martin and pohl 2000 here v flow velocity g gravity constant h flow depth œÅ water density œÉ water surface tension and ŒΩ water kinematic viscosity an accurate dynamic similitude exists only at a full scale therefore scale effects in hydraulic modelling lead to errors in prototype results haque et al 2006 wang and chanson 2016 examining the modelling scale is effective on the hydraulic simulation results in both oblique and non oblique models bayle et al 2021 link et al 2019 savage et al 2016 furthermore to increase the accuracy of the results and confirm that the effect of scale is insignificant by creating special conditions in the model was attempted the forces that are not effective in the prototype are not effective in the model as well heller 2011 gabl et al 2014 here it is necessary to calculate the values of the difference in the hydraulic characteristics of the flow including depth average velocity and velocity distribution with the results of other researchers more will be discussed later according to table 2 the flow in all subcritical and turbulent tests and surface tension has no effect on the flow therefore a large scale laboratory model is considered table 2 shows the conditions of experimental tests in which q flow rate per unit width hd water depth over the inlet weir

based on the report heller 2017 three conditions of geometric kinematic and dynamic similarity should be created for hydraulic simulation therefore the modelling results can be generalized to the prototype influential dimensionless ratios were determined by buckingham s dimensional analysis method and their variations were investigated through laboratory results based on the research of yalin

qs is the average sediment flux of the bed load kg s rh is the hydraulic radius of the bed over the floodplain m u is the average flow velocity m s sf is the sinuosity effectiveness factor ds is the

1 1 water surface slope analysis to investigate the effect of the channel s continuous bends on the water surface profile the longitudinal and transverse water level variation y of the bank floor at angles of zero 30 and 60 degrees concerning the bend apexes of cs01 to cs07 sections were measured and drawn in fig 3 the results showed an increase in the relative depth from 0 3 to 0 55 reduced the effect of the meandering channel over the dropping in the water surface profile therefore by reducing the effect of centrifugal force the piezometric water surface profile was more dependent on the flow hydraulics with hydrostatic pressure fig 3 a similarly results were reported in a laboratory study by zhang et al 2019 in other words at a constant flow rate of 61 1 lit s m a relative depth of 0 3 was reported with flow turbulence and water level variation in the width and length of the channel more than the relative depth of 0 55 in the longitudinal path of the channel the biggest variate in water level was reported between cs01 and cs07 sections table 3 it can be seen that at a relative depth of 0 55 the lowest energy loss with an average value of 6 occurred along the path also with an increase of 83 3 in the relative depth of the flow the relative energy loss between these two sections decreased with the highest percentage and with an average value of 62 fig 3 b the trend of variation transverse in water level was measured in the cs01 to cs03 and cs05 to cs07 sections 32 decreasing and 59 increasing respectively it is important to note that the cs04 section was the one with the least turbulence and transverse variation in water level compared to other sections for this reason it is suitable for measuring the relative depth in experiments moreover the inner bending apexes had the largest dropping transverse water level variation in the cs01 and cs07 sections with more than 40 comparing the results of the transverse profile of flow velocity in the cs01 section with other researchers showed a better understanding of the unique characteristics of the flow in the meandering compound channel model fig 4 zhang et al 2017 investigated the flow pattern in a straight compound channel with vegetation cover the results showed that the distribution of the analytical average speed was consistent with the simulated and experimental models also a sudden jump in velocity was observed at the joint border of the main channel and floodplain khuntia et al 2018 investigated boundary shear stress distribution in a straight compound channel using an artificial neural network they used a large number of experimental data including width ratio relative flow depth roughness ratio reynolds number froude number bed slope and aspect ratio to test and validate the model shan et al 2017 conducted a study to provide an analytical model for predicting the stage discharge relationship of high flows in a meandering compound channel with dense flexible and submerged vegetation in floodplains they used experimental and field results to validate the proposed model the results showed that the model accurately predicted the sub area discharges and the stage discharge relationships the measurement of the velocity distribution in a bending section showed that the centrifugal force and the secondary flow created in the bend caused the parabolic shape of the average velocity profile to be disturbed across the cross section and the formation of the high velocity zone at the inner bend apex similarly huang et al 2014 stated that due to the centrifugal force the flow depth in the outer and inner bends increases and decreases respectively as a result of the hydrostatic pressure gradient created in the cross section the surface flow moved towards the outer bend and the secondary flow near the bed moved towards the inner bend the effect of centrifugal force and the hydrostatic gradient on the water surface both contribute to the velocity difference in the bending channel shiono and knight 1991 keshavarzi et al 2015 here ud is the depth averaged velocity parameter is calculated from eq 1 h is the water depth of the main channel and u is the average velocity of a point in the grid data 5 u d 1 h 0 h u d z hence to analyze the effect of the parallel floodplain and main channel walls on bed erosion were calculated flow characteristics such as velocity gradient distribution flow turbulence intensity and bed shear stress 3 1 2 distribution of flow velocity flow hydraulics in meandering rivers was analyzed by drawing the distribution pattern of flow velocity components u v and w in three directions of x y and z coordinates respectively in fig 5 the positive and negative variations of the flow velocity s value indicated the divergence convergence zones streamlines due to the meandering channel that with the creation of the maximum longitudinal and transverse velocity was shifted to the inner bend apexes the longitudinal velocity component was measured in cross sections cs03 to cs07 with zero and even negative values on the left bank of the floodplain fig 5 a shows that the apex of bend cs01 exerted a large centrifugal force on the main flow of the channel therefore practically the cross section perpendicular to the current in the left bank has a negligible role in transferring the flow downstream also section cs04 as an intermediate section with the formation of the largest cells of maximum and minimum longitudinal velocity respectively on the right and the left bank has a balancing role in channel capacity passage the balancing role of this section is quite clear in the longitudinal and transverse profiles of the water level drawn in fig 3 both transverse and vertical velocity components with negative and positive values indicated the mutual effect of the flow in the main channel and the floodplain fig 5 b and c the entanglement of these two velocity components indicates vortex flow secondary flow between the main channel and the floodplain the intensification of the transverse velocity cell size with positive values on the left bank of sections cs03 to cs05 emphasizes the stagnation of the flow in this area while the intensified cell reached its maximum value in the left bank of section cs05 also section cs03 with the largest negative cell of transverse velocities can play an important role in transferring bed load to the stagnant region based on research blanckaert and de vriend 2004 ferreira da silva and ebrahimi 2017 a bending channel is the flow movement with high momentum towards the outer bank in the upper fluid layers and inverse the low momentum towards the inner bank in the lower layers occurs the occurrence of maximum negative downward values in the vertical velocity cell from sections cs01 to cs03 causes the jet to hit the sediments of the bed scour of grain because of nature s interaction in transporting sediment to stagnation areas meandering patterns an important role in the evolution of river morphology shields et al 2005 and the development of meander bends zen et al 2016 in fig 5 c measured the maximum values of upward positive vertical velocity at the border of the main channel and the left bank of section cs05 that prevent the transfer of grain downwards fig 6 showed at the relative depth of 0 3 the maximum values of the longitudinal velocity occurred mainly in the central axis of the compound section of the channel and with the maximum value on the apexes of the inner bend increasing in relative depth the concentrated cell of high velocities became larger and then shifting from the main section of the channel was motioned towards the bank and the apex of the inner bend of the floodplain in cs01 and cs07 sections increasing the flow relative depth to 50 the longitudinal velocity value was increased by 19 the reason for this incident was the higher strength of the eddies and the intensity of interaction between the main channel and the floodplain at a relatively lower depth for similar experiments in a meandering compound channel of the straight it was shown by shahsavari et al 2020 that with a 50 decrease in the relative depth the longitudinal components of the velocity increased by 10 4 for all relative depths the development of eddy cores with negative and zero longitudinal and transverse velocity on the left bank of the flood plain in sections cs03 to cs07 indicated that flow returned to the upstream direction and with the formation of a low stress flow stagnation area and prone to sedimentation figs 5 and 6 therefore the main reason for this difference was only the centrifugal force applied to the flow in the bend which intensified the strength of the vortexes and the intensity of the interaction between the main channel and the floodplain as shown in sections cs01 to cs07 in fig 5 the flow under the effect of the parallel wall of the floodplain with the meandering path of the main channel centrifugal force effect and the interaction at the intersection of the compound section velocity gradient and momentum transfer behaviour differently from straight channels with compound cross section fig 7 the physical model of the channel pan et al 2019 was a straight compound cross section with a meandering main channel therefore the maximum value of the vertical velocity was usually measured lower than the transverse velocity however in the different laboratory model of the present research due to the floodplain s wall parallel to the meandering main channel the maximum vertical velocity was reported to be lower than the transverse velocity in fig 7 b and c the intensification of the positive and negative values of the velocity components in the bends created many vortices with strong helix flows showing the turbulence and three dimensionality of the flow in this type of cross section the positive and negative magnitude variations of the transverse and vertical velocity components in the main channel and flood plains indicate the presence of eddies and secondary clockwise and counterclockwise flow in these areas fig 8 shows the comparison between the depth average profiles of three velocity components the depth average longitudinal velocity profile for all sections did not follow the semi logarithmic form with the maximum velocity at the water surface the maximum value of the longitudinal average velocity occurred in the middle depths of the main channel which is contrary to the results presented in straight and even meandering channels with a simple cross section by shan et al 2017 and qu et al 2020 the comparison between cs01 and cs07 sections showed that the two depth profiles longitudinal velocities were shifted in the flood plains on the sides of the main channel as was occurred with an almost similar profile in value but with the opposite sign positive and negative for other sections no significant similarity has been recorded following fig 8 it can be concluded that in all seven sections the values of longitudinal velocity played a central and dominant role in the streamlined direction of the flow passing through the compound and meandering channel the cs02 and cs03 sections with the maximum value of negative transverse velocity in the central axis of the channel were affected by the intensification of centrifugal force and secondary flows in the bend which with the eddy formation and turbulence an effective role played in the flow deviation towards the left bank of the section the vertical velocity has low and close to zero values compared to other velocity components unlike the results presented in straight channels with simple and even compound meandering cross sections by randle 2020 which has little effect on the hydraulic flow while the results reported in fig 8 are in good agreement with the depth profiles drawn in the natural bend of the hooghly river by kumar das et al 2020 according to table 4 relative average of the longitudinal velocities measured in the central axis of the main channel in the interval ud uave 1 2 was calculated with an average value of 1 44 which is close to the total average velocity of the compound cross section of uave in addition the transverse and vertical velocities are much less than the average longitudinal velocity by relative average values of 0 25 and 0 0002 respectively as shown in fig 8 variations of the average relative of the longitudinal velocities in the flood centre axis of the plains were calculated with a rapid decrease in the left bank from cs01 to cs03 section and a gradual increase in the right bank from cs01 to cs07 these results are exactly in accordance with the decreasing and increasing trend of the water level in the bend reported in fig 3 also except for the right bank in cs06 and cs07 relative average transverse velocities were recorded with a negative value and close to zero in all sections the reported results show the significant impact of the centrifugal force in the meandering plan of the channel and the compound cross section which caused the convergence of the streamlines in the shortest distance between the apex of the channel bends as shown in figs 6 and 7 decreasing relative depth with the increase in turbulence and transverse differences in the water surface fig 3b was caused an increase in the transverse gradient of the average velocity fig 9 variation in the longitudinal average velocity values especially the decrease increase and negative at the intersection between the main channel and flood plains was indicated the flow transfer and significant variant in the momentum between these two sections notably the high and irregular velocity gradient in this region according to kordi et al 2015 may be due to flows with weak momentum which were transferred from the lower to upper layers of the flow due to the deep vortex therefore due to the energy loss caused by the suppression of the toward up eddies by the main flow apex an intense decrease gradient occurred in the values of the longitudinal average velocity of the flow the longitudinal average velocity profile for all sections does not follow a parabolic form with the maximum velocity at the central axis therefore the maximum value of the average velocity in the transverse cross section occurred near the inner bend apex which is opposite to the results presented in straight channels with a meandering or simple cross section esfahani and keshavarzi 2011 zheng et al 2017 naghavi et al 2023 it should be noted that similar results can be seen in sources in the meandering channel with a sinuosity coefficient of less than 1 3 the longitudinal average velocity profile was reported with the maximum value in the outer bend ferreira da silva and ebrahimi 2017 farzadkhoo et al 2019 randle 2020 therefore the sinuosity coefficient parameter is the effective factor in the occurrence position of the maximum velocity value by creating a longitudinal velocity intense gradient in the cross section of the meandering channel following table 5 the ratio of ud fp ud t for the outer and inner banks was a function of the relative depth of the flow which is less and more than one respectively thus the flow in the outer floodplain unlike the inner floodplain has a reducing effect on the flow velocity in the main channel according to fig 6 the reason for this is the formation of a stagnation area on the left bank of sections cs03 to cs05 the velocity in the main channel is always higher than in the flood plains and the ratio of ud fp ud mc was calculated as less than one here for all seven cross sections with the doubling of the relative depth the relative value of the ratio of ud fp ud mc was at least 2 5 times also at a constant relative depth decreasing of 60 in the average flow rate caused of 25 decrease in the ratio of ud fp ud mc as the relative depth increases the ratio of ud mc ud t decreases and the ratio of ud fp ud t increased therefore the average velocity values in the main channel and the floodplains reached the average velocity of the total cross section 3 1 3 the intensity of flow turbulence the kinetic energy of the turbulence tke 0 5 u 2 v 2 w 2 and the average kinetic energy of its flow mke 0 5 u d 2 v d 2 w d 2 are indicators of the flow s turbulence intensity actually representing they indicate the momentum transfer between the layers of the turbulent flow davidson 2015 here w d v d u d and w v u are the depth average velocity and the velocity fluctuations in the x y and z axes respectively according to the report presented by tominaga and nezu 1991 the increase in the intensity of the flow turbulence is one of the effective factors in increasing the shear stress near the bed biron et al 2004 determined that in a complex flow over a mobile bed the tke method provided the best match to bed topography with significant increases in shear stress values over scour holes because longitudinal velocity fluctuations may contribute more to shear stress than vertical fluctuations similar results were reported by tilston 2005 in a field study on shear stress in a meandering bend therefore in this subsection the average value of the kinetic energy of the flow and the kinetic energy of turbulence per unit of mass was investigated according to figs 7 and 8 the longitudinal component of the flow velocity always occurred with larger values than the transverse and vertical velocities therefore the transverse variations of the tke with a similar trend indicate an increase in the intensity of turbulence in the zone intersection of the main cross section and the floodplain in addition to the vertices of the inner bend fig 10 it was similarly reported by report termini and piraino 2011 the turbulent flow pattern drawn at a relative depth of 0 3 showed the largest value of average kinetic energy and kinetic energy of turbulence in the central axis of the main channel increasing the relative depth to 0 55 this pattern is different therefore the maximum values of the kinetic energy of turbulence were recorded in addition to the apex of the bend in the intersection border between the main cross section and the floodplain on the left bank of the middle sections of the channel cs04 and cs05 it should be noted that tke and mke follow the decreasing trend on the outer bank of the floodplain at the bending apex the trend of transverse variation in the value of flow turbulence parameters is decreasing with increasing relative depth in other words increasing the relative depth to 0 55 and reducing the intensity of the interaction effect of flow shifting between the main cross section and the banks of the floodplains tke and mke parameters were reported with lower values and a more uniform trend compared to the relative depth of 0 3 reducing the relative depth by approximately 50 caused increasing the predominance of the compound cross section of the waterway over the passing flow pattern and the intensity of the flow turbulence in the entire cross section was calculated up to two times conducted laboratory experiments by jamieson et al 2013 to study the flow field and sediment dynamics in a moving bed channel bend showed that the position of the occurrence of maximum non principle reynolds stress values œÑuv and œÑvw corresponds to the location of the maximum longitudinal velocity tke and erosion 3 1 4 bed shear stress œÑo n m2 estimation of the shear velocity of the bed in open channels is of significant importance to calculate the flow resistance and transport of sediment downstream of the channel there are several methods to calculate this parameter that in the present study was used by balouchi et al 2022 2 œÑ b œÑ bv 2 œÑ bu 2 œÑ bu œÅ g c 2 u u 2 v 2 œÑ bu œÅ g c 2 v u 2 v 2 c 1 n r h 1 6 where œÑb œÑbu and œÑbv are total bed shear stress n m2 and bed

1 h z b z s u d z v 1 h z b z s v d z where h is the water depth m zs and zb are water and bed surface levels m respectively fig 11 shows that with a 50 increase in the relative depth of the flow from 0 3 to 0 55 the maximum bed shear stress in the meandering path of the river decreases by 211 by changing the value from 5 6 to 1 8 n m2 which shows that the boundary between the main section and the floodplain will have a greater effect on the value of bed shear stress at lower relative depths in a constant relative depth of 0 3 the maximum bed shear stress values similar to the velocity pattern fig 6 occurred mainly in the middle of the waterway and on the noses of the inner arch in the main section therefore at lower relative depths the main section of the channel is more exposed to erosion however increasing the relative depth of the maximum bed shear stress values due to the expansion of the high velocity flow cells across the channel occurred toward the inner bend apexes of the floodplain cs01 and cs07 sections fig 11 c and d show the difference in the expansion pattern of the maximum bed shear stress cells at a relative depth of 0 55 for different flow rates of 24 and 61 1 lit s m probably the reason for this phenomenon is the low difference in the values of the depth average velocity of the flow which according to fig 10 has a more uniform state in the width of the channel at a lower flow rate therefore the bed shear stress pattern calculated in fig 11 for the two flow rates is slightly different the results showed that both the relative depth and froud number factors are effective on the occurrence location of the maximum shear stress values in each cross section following the science of sediment hydraulics the increase in shear stress in different locations of each section indicates an increase in the drag force on the sediment particles in the rivers which increases erosion and transfer of sediment downstream in that location similar results have been reported by jamieson et al 2013 strong secondary currents with high momentum transfer between the main channel and the floodplain lead to the creation of a strong gradient in the transverse distribution of average velocity flow kinetic energy and bed shear stress in their intersection the variation trend in the average values of bed shear stress turbulence kinetic energy tke and average kinetic energy mke was decreased with increasing relative flow depth 3 2 sediment transport the value of sediment flux transported downstream was estimated in three tests with froude numbers of 0 262 0 290 and 0 325 and relative depths between 0 3 and 0 55 in this series of tests the cross section of the main channel and floodplain were considered as mobile and fixed beds respectively based on the control test the scouring equilibrium time for each test was considered to be valued at 4 25 h fig 12 showsthatthe value of the total sediment load transported downstream increased greatly with the increase in discharge based on kinetic energy laws in the discussion of hydraulics flow by doubling the flow velocity the kinetic energy and as a result its erosive power quadruples wang et al 2019 here increasing flow to 2 5 times the maximum sediment flux and the total weight of sediment transferred downstream were increased by 3 and 5 respectively the geometric pattern drawn from the topography of the bed is in good agreement with the results presented in the discussion of flow hydraulics contour lines of tke and bed shear stress and vertical velocity with negative values in cs03 are in agreement with the eroded regions fig farzadkho and khazuri 2019 reported that reducing the angle of the bend by reducing the centrifugal force in the bends reduces the sediment near the meandering river bed fig 13 showed the pattern of sediment transport in a meandering channel with a compound cross section was different from the simple increasing flow rate the location of the maximum hole depth was neared the bending apex in the first section cs01 and the peak of the sedimentary hill was moved downstream hook 1975 jamieson et al 2013 showed similar findings increasing by 24 the froude number the sediment hill geometry from a pattern of a sharp nose and short elevation in the cs03 left bank was changed to a pattern of a vast nose and high elevation in the cs03 to cs05 left bank floodplain therefore the volume of sediments deposited in the stagnation area increased by 32 2 table 6 4 conclusion in this study the interaction between hydraulic flow sediment transport and meandering compound channel were investigated considering the parallel wall of the flood plains and the main channel the most important results are as follows in the meandering compound channel with a sinuosity coefficient of 1 3 the inner bending apexes are where the concentration of the maximum longitudinal velocities affected by the centrifugal force was focused with a 50 decrease in the flow relative depth the longitudinal velocity values increased by 19 the development of eddy cores with negative longitudinal velocity on the left bank of the flood plain in sections cs03 to cs07 indicated that flow returned to the upstream direction and with the formation of a low stress flow stagnation area and prone to sedimentation the positive and negative magnitude variations of the transverse and vertical flow velocity components in the main channel and flood plains indicate the presence of eddies and secondary clockwise and counterclockwise flow in these areas it is affected by the parallel wall of the floodplain with the meandering path of the main channel centrifugal force effect and also the interaction of the flow in the intersection of the compound cross section velocity gradient and momentum transfer the average values of shear stress in the channel width constantly decreased as the relative depth increases from 0 3 to 0 46 to 0 55 at the relative depth of 0 55 the maximum bed shear stress values occurred in the inner bend apex of the flood plain however reducing the relative depth causes shifting of the maximum values to the middle of the channel and on the inner bending apex of the main section therefore the main channel will be more exposed to erosion at lower relative depths the ratio of ud fp ud t for the outer and inner bank was a function of the relative depth of the flow which is less and more than one respectively so the flow in the outer floodplain unlike the inner floodplain has a reducing effect on the flow velocity in the main channel the velocity in the main channel is always higher than in the flood plains and the ratio ud fp ud mc was calculated as less than one as the relative depth increases the ratio ud mc ud t decreased and the ratio ud fp ud t increased so the average velocity values in the main channel as well as the floodplains reached the average velocity of the total section the variation trend in the average values of bed shear stress turbulence kinetic energy tke and average kinetic energy mke was decreased with increasing relative flow depth increasing the value flow to 2 5 times the maximum sediment rate and the total sediment transferred downstream were increased by 3 and 5 respectively it indicated a significant increase in the total volume of sediment yield that was transported downstream as the discharge increased the position maximum depth of the hole was neared to the bend apexes in the first section cs01 and the peak of the sedimentary hill was moved away from it the increase in the flow rate changed the geometric characteristic of the sedimentary hill from a sharp nose short height pattern in the low discharge to a wide high peak height pattern therefore with decreasing discharge the volume of sediments deposited in the stagnation area was decreased both factors of relative depth and discharge will be effective on the location of the occurrence of the maximum values of velocity bed shear stress maximum depth hole and peak of the sedimentary hill credit authorship contribution statement sobhan moradi conceptualization methodology investigation

1899,in this study the effect of the floodplain s parallel wall with a compound meandering main channel over the hydraulics flow has been analyzed experimentally a constant sinuosity factor of 1 3 and relative flow depths of 0 3 to 0 55 were considered to illustrate the effect of the hydraulic parameters on the variations of the velocity components velocity components were measured by adv velocimeter at seven cross sections with angles of zero 30 and 60 degrees and mesh size of 2 cm 2 cm furthermore a laser meter measured the topographies of the sediment bed in the 33 cross sections with an angle difference of 5 degrees to the bend apex the results showed that in lower relative depths due to vortexes and high turbulence intensity the ability of flood damage will be more eminent the cs04 section with the least longitudinal and transverse changes in the water level is the best position for hydraulic investigation of the meandering rivers the left bank in sections cs03 to cs07 will be the place of deposit of sediment in nature with the formation of the stagnation area the velocity of ud fp inner is 3 to 5 times higher than ud fp outer for this cause the flow in the outer bank unlike the inner bank has a reduced effect on the flow velocity in the main channel increasing the relative depth the ratio ud mc ud t and ud fp ud t decreased and increased respectively therefore the average velocity values in the main channel and the floodplains reached the average velocity of the whole section the flow velocity in the main channel is always higher than in the floodplains and the ratio ud fp ud mc is less than one the variation trend in the average values of bed shear stress turbulence kinetic energy tke and average kinetic energy mke was decreased with increasing relative flow depth both factors of relative depth and froude number will affect the location of the occurrence of the maximum values of velocity bed shear stress maximum depth hole and the peak of the sedimentary hill keywords river bend momentum transmission turbulent flow compound meandering channel sediment transport data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction as we can see in nature the deepest part of the rivers thalweg line takes on a meandering pattern in the longitudinal path which has caused the rivers to don t have a straight route and a simple cross section in the long routes therefore the formation and evolution of natural river morphology are frequently characterized by a compound cross section and meandering pattern during floods the floodplains in compound cross sections are essential in controlling and transporting excess flow and sediment yield downstream schumm and khan 1972 hence it is essential to pay attention to the unique hydraulic conditions that distinguish compound sections from regular and simple sections much research has been done on compound channels to date e g knight and demetriou 1983 pasche and rouv√© 1985 patra et al 2004 the results showed there is a significant difference in the flow depth and roughness of the main channel and the floodplains of a compound section the occurrence of a high velocity difference at the intersection of these two areas by increasing factors such as energy exchange the strength of the secondary flow strong lateral shear layers and energy loss reduces the flow through the channel as shown by sellin 1964 ferreira da silva 2006 yang et al 2007 shan et al 2017 liu et al 2021 li et al 2021 the velocity distribution in the cross section of an open channel is complicated and varies from one location to another because of the flow surface turbulence and the bed s shear stress maghrebi and givehchi 2009 three analytical models were extracted to determine the flow rate through simple s channels as well as symmetric and asymmetric compound channels liao and knight 2007 the turbulent pattern of the flow in the trapezoidal compound section straight path indicated when floodplain vegetation with density 0 œÜ 0 0314 is present the channel capacity rate is up to 31 lower than when there is non vegetation hamidifar and omid 2013 rozovskii 1957 was the first to investigate the flow structure in the river bend in the following by analyzing the flow hydraulics in the meanderingcompoundchannel it is possible to see that energy loss increases noticeably when the flow depth is greater than the level of the main channel toebes and sooky 1967 three dimensional modelling showed that flow turbulence in meandering compound channels is more complex than a straight path this phenomenon occurs due to high momentum exchange transverse hydrostatic pressure gradient and the effect of centrifugal force rozovskii 1957 rameshwaran and naden 2004 was afterwards explored experimentally and numerically by several scholars e g yalin 1992 blanckaert and graf 2001 wormleaton et al 2005 crosato 2008 esfahani and keshavarzi 2011 yang et al 2013 kordi et al 2015 engel and rhoads 2016 farzadkhoo 2019 randle 2020 taye and kumar 2021 naghavi et al 2023 they reported that the centrifugal force is the principal force infused into the flow in the river bend and that secondary flow originates from its interaction with the lateral hydrostatic pressure gradient checking the water level on convex and concave sides of a channel bend was done by installing a guide wall for three radii downslope and discharge in supercritical flow conditions the results showed that after installing the guide wall the froude number fr becomes smaller and even less than 1 0 also the water depth in the convex bank decreased with the decrease of the relative axial radius the water level difference in the sides of the sections decreases with the decrease in flow rate per unit of width or downslope zhang et al 2019 for uniform flow in a straight rectangular channel the logarithmic law of velocity distribution and the flow turbulence parameter were measured steffler et al 1985 based on field measurements conducted by engel and rhoads 2017 the depth averaged velocity distribution in a river bend unlike in a straight path is not logarithmic also the velocity in the outer bend is greater than the inner bend sukhodolov and kaschtschejewa 2010 whereas this is not always the case the results reported by de vriend and geldof 1983 showed that if the bend angle is sharp the speed in the inner bend is higher than the outer bend sui et al 2006 assessed the effect of the froude number of the entering flow on the secondary flow formation power and erosive power in the 90 degree arch of open channels the velocity distribution in the meandering channel indicated that the highest velocity values occurred at the bending apexes and were extended to deflection angles of 40 and even 60 degrees roca et al 2007 the formation mechanism of secondary flow in the main channel was reported to be different and with a larger concentration core than in floodplains it was stated that the reason for this phenomenon is the effect of a larger centrifugal force in the main channel shiono et al 1999 the secondary flow in the channel s bend was described as two vortex cells blanckaert and graf 2001 so that one of them is on the central axis and the other is near the outer bend with smaller eddies which is important to the erosion of the bed and walls the dimensionless ratio b h is linked to the quantity and shape of secondary flow cells patnaik et al 2014 b is the width channel and h is the water level by investigating the effect of the parallel of the meandering main channel with the floodplain wall on the hydraulics flow it was shown that the reynolds stress u w near the bed of the main channel had reached the maximum and positive values and moving away from the bed it was reached a negative value s and was showed its minimum amount near the flow surface moradi et al 2022 the transverse distribution of secondary flow in a meandering compound channel with mobile and fixed beds will be different due to the formation of the bed form in the mobile state shiono et al 2009 ibrahim et al 2016 shan et al 2017 the secondary flow and eddies created across the channel have a substantial impact on the prediction of velocity distribution and bed shear stress tang and knight 2015 in the bend of meandering rivers the secondary flow may have a significant effect on the lateral distribution of many hydraulic and morphological parameters such as flow velocity bed shear stress and sediment transport capacity tang and knight 2015 a change in the distribution of bed shear stress causes a significant change in the river s morphology such as bed erosion and sedimentation areas chen et al 2012 armanini and cavedon 2019 the pattern of erosion and sedimentation is not the same for any of the sinusoidal channels with large and small angles but by using the convergence and divergence of the streamlines from the centre line of the channel and creating a stagnation line it is possible to predict the probable region of erosion and sedimentation in the case of a mobile bed yalin and da silva 2001 the effect of changing the width to depth ratio b h was investigated using four different flow rates on the bed topography in a sinusoidal channel with an angle of 55 degrees the result indicates that increasing the flow rate and depth increases the height of the sediment hill and scour hole it also causes the movement of the region with high shear stress to the downstream side of the channel hooke 1975 the change of manning s friction coefficient was experimentally investigated based on the measurement of depth averaged velocity and bed shear stress in several different models of the channel cross section geometry khuntia et al 2016 the cause of the radial movement of sediment particles across the bend of the meandering channel was related to the significant difference in velocity and consequently the shear stress in the inner and outer bend esfahani and keshavarzis 2011 in the inner bend of the meandering river where the maximum velocity of the flow prevails scouring was also reported with maximum values the maximum shear stress on the banks of the channel indicates the high momentum of the flow in these areas where the processes of erosion and sedimentation are dominant keshavarzi et al 2016 previous literature attempted to find the effects of composite cross section on the flow structure in open channels with straight walls of the floodplain while most of the time the natural morphology of rivers can be seen with meandering patterns and compound sections therefore we intend to evaluate the interactions between hydraulic flow sediment transport and the meandering compound channel that were rarely studied the main contribution of this paper is to investigate the effect of the parallel wall of the floodplains and the meandering main channel on the hydraulic flow structure bed morphology in a sinuous bend and sediment flux downstream that is focused on the effect of different relative depths and froude numbers 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup laboratory meandering flume with a rectangular cross section was used with 7 36 m curve length 0 46 m width 0 48 m height and sinuosity coefficient of 1 3 in 4 5 consecutive bends fig 1 a in order to create a compound cross section a wide 0 15 m and high 0 14 m staircase was made symmetrically on both sides the ratio of the width floodplain to the main channel bfp bmc 1 and the longitudinal slope of 0 0012 were considered constant fig 1 b shows further details of the meandering compound channel with the equipment and section measurement location the geometric characteristics of the experimental meandering channel and the parallel details of the side walls were achieved based on mohanta and patra 2019 table 1 and fig 2 a three dimensional instantaneous velocity components in streamwise u radial v vertical directions w and velocity fluctuations u v w were measured by an acoustic doppler velocimeter adv the sampling frequency in all tests and for the duration time 60 s was measured at 25 hz the average flow velocities u v w were calculated from the average of 1500 instantaneous velocity data for each point all the reported data were screened and validated by using win adv software with a limited signal to noise ratio snr and correlation coefficient cor of greater than 15 db and 70 respectively sontek 1997 the recorded average snr values ranged from 24 to 26 with a cor of 80 98 velocity data were measured at 1953 grid points in 7 cross sections cs01 cs07 with angles of zero 30 and 60 degrees to the bend apex fig 1 b generally data was measured with a mesh grid of 2 cm 2 cm and 1 cm 1 cm in the common area of the main channel and flood plain respectively fig 2 b the flow velocity components in the three directions of x y and z in cs02 to cs06 sections were converted from cartesian into curvilinear coordinates in cs01 and cs07 sections the coordinates axis was considered with a cartesian condition uniform graded sediment was used with a median diameter d50 of 1 19 mm and a standard deviation Œ¥ g d 75 d 25 of 1 38 in the experiments as a result of no changes in bed level during the test and achieved equilibrium bed at 4 25 hr was measured the topography of the bed the duration of experimental tests to achieve similar equilibrium conditions by keshavarzi et al 2016 ranged from 6 to 12 h a gap with an opening of 0 03 m across the channel was used to measure the amount of sediment flux downstream this gap was leveled with the height of 0 14 m for mobile bed sediment at the beginning of each experiment to fulfil the measurements a monitoring system was manufactured including an electric motor and a rectangular frame 0 85 m 0 68 m sectioned into 17 rectangular subsections the subsections of the frame were covered by a fine meshed net in the shape of small bags to capture sediments at the outlet at each run of the experiment sediments required 4 25 hr to achieve equilibrium with the maximum water flow therefore all experiments were run for 4 25 hr during which each bag captured the sediments for about 15 min fig 2 c a digital point gauge with a tolerance of 0 5 mm was used and the topography of the bed sediment was measured at 759 grid points in 33 cross sections cs01 cs33 with an angle difference of 5 degrees relative to each other the volumetric flow rate was calibrated with frequency values of the inverter device to the range of 5 4 61 1 lit s m total channel width is 0 46 m an end gate was used to control the relative flow depth ranges of 0 3 0 55 to establish the steady flow dr h h h h and h are the main channel water depth and floodplain height respectively fourteen rulers were attached given that the flow depth is different on both sides of the flood wall at any section due to curve sketch and centrifugal force according to the recommendation by tominaga et al 1989 in order to avoid the affection of the upstream and downstream boundary conditions on the flow characteristics the data measurement range was considered at a distance of 3 2 m 3l 2 from the beginning of the flume due to the similarity of the flow pattern and sediment transport at a full wavelength of the channel Œª 1 6 m the data were measured at half a wavelength 2 2 scale effects besides hydraulic analysis approaches physical modelling is the oldest tool for simulating flow dynamics in hydraulic engineering free surface flows are typically scaled by the froude number simulation which is the same in both the model and the prototype fr v gh 0 5 if the reynolds number similarity applies the froude number may lead to non negligible scale effects therefore the effect of gravity on the fluid flow should be negligible in the reynolds model torres et al 2018 because the reynolds number in most real scale flows is both turbulent and in the hydraulically rough regime the differences in results are independent of r e g moody diagram flows in hydraulic froude models are often shifted to the hydraulic rough regime to better account for losses therefore the sediment transport in models is affected by scale effects because the internal flow turbulence defined by the reynolds number re vh ŒΩ is underestimated while surface tension defined by the weber number we œÅv2h œÉ is overestimated chanson 2009 no model with weber number similarity was ever built based on le m√©haut√© 2013 and w may always be a source of scale effects surface tension is negligible for most prototypes in hydraulic engineering martin and pohl 2000 here v flow velocity g gravity constant h flow depth œÅ water density œÉ water surface tension and ŒΩ water kinematic viscosity an accurate dynamic similitude exists only at a full scale therefore scale effects in hydraulic modelling lead to errors in prototype results haque et al 2006 wang and chanson 2016 examining the modelling scale is effective on the hydraulic simulation results in both oblique and non oblique models bayle et al 2021 link et al 2019 savage et al 2016 furthermore to increase the accuracy of the results and confirm that the effect of scale is insignificant by creating special conditions in the model was attempted the forces that are not effective in the prototype are not effective in the model as well heller 2011 gabl et al 2014 here it is necessary to calculate the values of the difference in the hydraulic characteristics of the flow including depth average velocity and velocity distribution with the results of other researchers more will be discussed later according to table 2 the flow in all subcritical and turbulent tests and surface tension has no effect on the flow therefore a large scale laboratory model is considered table 2 shows the conditions of experimental tests in which q flow rate per unit width hd water depth over the inlet weir

based on the report heller 2017 three conditions of geometric kinematic and dynamic similarity should be created for hydraulic simulation therefore the modelling results can be generalized to the prototype influential dimensionless ratios were determined by buckingham s dimensional analysis method and their variations were investigated through laboratory results based on the research of yalin

1 1 water surface slope analysis to investigate the effect of the channel s continuous bends on the water surface profile the longitudinal and transverse water level variation y of the bank floor at angles of zero 30 and 60 degrees concerning the bend apexes of cs01 to cs07 sections were measured and drawn in fig 3 the results showed an increase in the relative depth from 0 3 to 0 55 reduced the effect of the meandering channel over the dropping in the water surface profile therefore by reducing the effect of centrifugal force the piezometric water surface profile was more dependent on the flow hydraulics with hydrostatic pressure fig 3 a similarly results were reported in a laboratory study by zhang et al 2019 in other words at a constant flow rate of 61 1 lit s m a relative depth of 0 3 was reported with flow turbulence and water level variation in the width and length of the channel more than the relative depth of 0 55 in the longitudinal path of the channel the biggest variate in water level was reported between cs01 and cs07 sections table 3 it can be seen that at a relative depth of 0 55 the lowest energy loss with an average value of 6 occurred along the path also with an increase of 83 3 in the relative depth of the flow the relative energy loss between these two sections decreased with the highest percentage and with an average value of 62 fig 3 b the trend of variation transverse in water level was measured in the cs01 to cs03 and cs05 to cs07 sections 32 decreasing and 59 increasing respectively it is important to note that the cs04 section was the one with the least turbulence and transverse variation in water level compared to other sections for this reason it is suitable for measuring the relative depth in experiments moreover the inner bending apexes had the largest dropping transverse water level variation in the cs01 and cs07 sections with more than 40 comparing the results of the transverse profile of flow velocity in the cs01 section with other researchers showed a better understanding of the unique characteristics of the flow in the meandering compound channel model fig 4 zhang et al 2017 investigated the flow pattern in a straight compound channel with vegetation cover the results showed that the distribution of the analytical average speed was consistent with the simulated and experimental models also a sudden jump in velocity was observed at the joint border of the main channel and floodplain khuntia et al 2018 investigated boundary shear stress distribution in a straight compound channel using an artificial neural network they used a large number of experimental data including width ratio relative flow depth roughness ratio reynolds number froude number bed slope and aspect ratio to test and validate the model shan et al 2017 conducted a study to provide an analytical model for predicting the stage discharge relationship of high flows in a meandering compound channel with dense flexible and submerged vegetation in floodplains they used experimental and field results to validate the proposed model the results showed that the model accurately predicted the sub area discharges and the stage discharge relationships the measurement of the velocity distribution in a bending section showed that the centrifugal force and the secondary flow created in the bend caused the parabolic shape of the average velocity profile to be disturbed across the cross section and the formation of the high velocity zone at the inner bend apex similarly huang et al 2014 stated that due to the centrifugal force the flow depth in the outer and inner bends increases and decreases respectively as a result of the hydrostatic pressure gradient created in the cross section the surface flow moved towards the outer bend and the secondary flow near the bed moved towards the inner bend the effect of centrifugal force and the hydrostatic gradient on the water surface both contribute to the velocity difference in the bending channel shiono and knight 1991 keshavarzi et al 2015 here ud is the depth averaged velocity parameter is calculated from eq 1 h is the water depth of the main channel and u is the average velocity of a point in the grid data 5 u d 1 h 0 h u d z hence to analyze the effect of the parallel floodplain and main channel walls on bed erosion were calculated flow characteristics such as velocity gradient distribution flow turbulence intensity and bed shear stress 3 1 2 distribution of flow velocity flow hydraulics in meandering rivers was analyzed by drawing the distribution pattern of flow velocity components u v and w in three directions of x y and z coordinates respectively in fig 5 the positive and negative variations of the flow velocity s value indicated the divergence convergence zones streamlines due to the meandering channel that with the creation of the maximum longitudinal and transverse velocity was shifted to the inner bend apexes the longitudinal velocity component was measured in cross sections cs03 to cs07 with zero and even negative values on the left bank of the floodplain fig 5 a shows that the apex of bend cs01 exerted a large centrifugal force on the main flow of the channel therefore practically the cross section perpendicular to the current in the left bank has a negligible role in transferring the flow downstream also section cs04 as an intermediate section with the formation of the largest cells of maximum and minimum longitudinal velocity respectively on the right and the left bank has a balancing role in channel capacity passage the balancing role of this section is quite clear in the longitudinal and transverse profiles of the water level drawn in fig 3 both transverse and vertical velocity components with negative and positive values indicated the mutual effect of the flow in the main channel and the floodplain fig 5 b and c the entanglement of these two velocity components indicates vortex flow secondary flow between the main channel and the floodplain the intensification of the transverse velocity cell size with positive values on the left bank of sections cs03 to cs05 emphasizes the stagnation of the flow in this area while the intensified cell reached its maximum value in the left bank of section cs05 also section cs03 with the largest negative cell of transverse velocities can play an important role in transferring bed load to the stagnant region based on research blanckaert and de vriend 2004 ferreira da silva and ebrahimi 2017 a bending channel is the flow movement with high momentum towards the outer bank in the upper fluid layers and inverse the low momentum towards the inner bank in the lower layers occurs the occurrence of maximum negative downward values in the vertical velocity cell from sections cs01 to cs03 causes the jet to hit the sediments of the bed scour of grain because of nature s interaction in transporting sediment to stagnation areas meandering patterns an important role in the evolution of river morphology shields et al 2005 and the development of meander bends zen et al 2016 in fig 5 c measured the maximum values of upward positive vertical velocity at the border of the main channel and the left bank of section cs05 that prevent the transfer of grain downwards fig 6 showed at the relative depth of 0 3 the maximum values of the longitudinal velocity occurred mainly in the central axis of the compound section of the channel and with the maximum value on the apexes of the inner bend increasing in relative depth the concentrated cell of high velocities became larger and then shifting from the main section of the channel was motioned towards the bank and the apex of the inner bend of the floodplain in cs01 and cs07 sections increasing the flow relative depth to 50 the longitudinal velocity value was increased by 19 the reason for this incident was the higher strength of the eddies and the intensity of interaction between the main channel and the floodplain at a relatively lower depth for similar experiments in a meandering compound channel of the straight it was shown by shahsavari et al 2020 that with a 50 decrease in the relative depth the longitudinal components of the velocity increased by 10 4 for all relative depths the development of eddy cores with negative and zero longitudinal and transverse velocity on the left bank of the flood plain in sections cs03 to cs07 indicated that flow returned to the upstream direction and with the formation of a low stress flow stagnation area and prone to sedimentation figs 5 and 6 therefore the main reason for this difference was only the centrifugal force applied to the flow in the bend which intensified the strength of the vortexes and the intensity of the interaction between the main channel and the floodplain as shown in sections cs01 to cs07 in fig 5 the flow under the effect of the parallel wall of the floodplain with the meandering path of the main channel centrifugal force effect and the interaction at the intersection of the compound section velocity gradient and momentum transfer behaviour differently from straight channels with compound cross section fig 7 the physical model of the channel pan et al 2019 was a straight compound cross section with a meandering main channel therefore the maximum value of the vertical velocity was usually measured lower than the transverse velocity however in the different laboratory model of the present research due to the floodplain s wall parallel to the meandering main channel the maximum vertical velocity was reported to be lower than the transverse velocity in fig 7 b and c the intensification of the positive and negative values of the velocity components in the bends created many vortices with strong helix flows showing the turbulence and three dimensionality of the flow in this type of cross section the positive and negative magnitude variations of the transverse and vertical velocity components in the main channel and flood plains indicate the presence of eddies and secondary clockwise and counterclockwise flow in these areas fig 8 shows the comparison between the depth average profiles of three velocity components the depth average longitudinal velocity profile for all sections did not follow the semi logarithmic form with the maximum velocity at the water surface the maximum value of the longitudinal average velocity occurred in the middle depths of the main channel which is contrary to the results presented in straight and even meandering channels with a simple cross section by shan et al 2017 and qu et al 2020 the comparison between cs01 and cs07 sections showed that the two depth profiles longitudinal velocities were shifted in the flood plains on the sides of the main channel as was occurred with an almost similar profile in value but with the opposite sign positive and negative for other sections no significant similarity has been recorded following fig 8 it can be concluded that in all seven sections the values of longitudinal velocity played a central and dominant role in the streamlined direction of the flow passing through the compound and meandering channel the cs02 and cs03 sections with the maximum value of negative transverse velocity in the central axis of the channel were affected by the intensification of centrifugal force and secondary flows in the bend which with the eddy formation and turbulence an effective role played in the flow deviation towards the left bank of the section the vertical velocity has low and close to zero values compared to other velocity components unlike the results presented in straight channels with simple and even compound meandering cross sections by randle 2020 which has little effect on the hydraulic flow while the results reported in fig 8 are in good agreement with the depth profiles drawn in the natural bend of the hooghly river by kumar das et al 2020 according to table 4 relative average of the longitudinal velocities measured in the central axis of the main channel in the interval ud uave 1 2 was calculated with an average value of 1 44 which is close to the total average velocity of the compound cross section of uave in addition the transverse and vertical velocities are much less than the average longitudinal velocity by relative average values of 0 25 and 0 0002 respectively as shown in fig 8 variations of the average relative of the longitudinal velocities in the flood centre axis of the plains were calculated with a rapid decrease in the left bank from cs01 to cs03 section and a gradual increase in the right bank from cs01 to cs07 these results are exactly in accordance with the decreasing and increasing trend of the water level in the bend reported in fig 3 also except for the right bank in cs06 and cs07 relative average transverse velocities were recorded with a negative value and close to zero in all sections the reported results show the significant impact of the centrifugal force in the meandering plan of the channel and the compound cross section which caused the convergence of the streamlines in the shortest distance between the apex of the channel bends as shown in figs 6 and 7 decreasing relative depth with the increase in turbulence and transverse differences in the water surface fig 3b was caused an increase in the transverse gradient of the average velocity fig 9 variation in the longitudinal average velocity values especially the decrease increase and negative at the intersection between the main channel and flood plains was indicated the flow transfer and significant variant in the momentum between these two sections notably the high and irregular velocity gradient in this region according to kordi et al 2015 may be due to flows with weak momentum which were transferred from the lower to upper layers of the flow due to the deep vortex therefore due to the energy loss caused by the suppression of the toward up eddies by the main flow apex an intense decrease gradient occurred in the values of the longitudinal average velocity of the flow the longitudinal average velocity profile for all sections does not follow a parabolic form with the maximum velocity at the central axis therefore the maximum value of the average velocity in the transverse cross section occurred near the inner bend apex which is opposite to the results presented in straight channels with a meandering or simple cross section esfahani and keshavarzi 2011 zheng et al 2017 naghavi et al 2023 it should be noted that similar results can be seen in sources in the meandering channel with a sinuosity coefficient of less than 1 3 the longitudinal average velocity profile was reported with the maximum value in the outer bend ferreira da silva and ebrahimi 2017 farzadkhoo et al 2019 randle 2020 therefore the sinuosity coefficient parameter is the effective factor in the occurrence position of the maximum velocity value by creating a longitudinal velocity intense gradient in the cross section of the meandering channel following table 5 the ratio of ud fp ud t for the outer and inner banks was a function of the relative depth of the flow which is less and more than one respectively thus the flow in the outer floodplain unlike the inner floodplain has a reducing effect on the flow velocity in the main channel according to fig 6 the reason for this is the formation of a stagnation area on the left bank of sections cs03 to cs05 the velocity in the main channel is always higher than in the flood plains and the ratio of ud fp ud mc was calculated as less than one here for all seven cross sections with the doubling of the relative depth the relative value of the ratio of ud fp ud mc was at least 2 5 times also at a constant relative depth decreasing of 60 in the average flow rate caused of 25 decrease in the ratio of ud fp ud mc as the relative depth increases the ratio of ud mc ud t decreases and the ratio of ud fp ud t increased therefore the average velocity values in the main channel and the floodplains reached the average velocity of the total cross section 3 1 3 the intensity of flow turbulence the kinetic energy of the turbulence tke 0 5 u 2 v 2 w 2 and the average kinetic energy of its flow mke 0 5 u d 2 v d 2 w d 2 are indicators of the flow s turbulence intensity actually representing they indicate the momentum transfer between the layers of the turbulent flow davidson 2015 here w d v d u d and w v u are the depth average velocity and the velocity fluctuations in the x y and z axes respectively according to the report presented by tominaga and nezu 1991 the increase in the intensity of the flow turbulence is one of the effective factors in increasing the shear stress near the bed biron et al 2004 determined that in a complex flow over a mobile bed the tke method provided the best match to bed topography with significant increases in shear stress values over scour holes because longitudinal velocity fluctuations may contribute more to shear stress than vertical fluctuations similar results were reported by tilston 2005 in a field study on shear stress in a meandering bend therefore in this subsection the average value of the kinetic energy of the flow and the kinetic energy of turbulence per unit of mass was investigated according to figs 7 and 8 the longitudinal component of the flow velocity always occurred with larger values than the transverse and vertical velocities therefore the transverse variations of the tke with a similar trend indicate an increase in the intensity of turbulence in the zone intersection of the main cross section and the floodplain in addition to the vertices of the inner bend fig 10 it was similarly reported by report termini and piraino 2011 the turbulent flow pattern drawn at a relative depth of 0 3 showed the largest value of average kinetic energy and kinetic energy of turbulence in the central axis of the main channel increasing the relative depth to 0 55 this pattern is different therefore the maximum values of the kinetic energy of turbulence were recorded in addition to the apex of the bend in the intersection border between the main cross section and the floodplain on the left bank of the middle sections of the channel cs04 and cs05 it should be noted that tke and mke follow the decreasing trend on the outer bank of the floodplain at the bending apex the trend of transverse variation in the value of flow turbulence parameters is decreasing with increasing relative depth in other words increasing the relative depth to 0 55 and reducing the intensity of the interaction effect of flow shifting between the main cross section and the banks of the floodplains tke and mke parameters were reported with lower values and a more uniform trend compared to the relative depth of 0 3 reducing the relative depth by approximately 50 caused increasing the predominance of the compound cross section of the waterway over the passing flow pattern and the intensity of the flow turbulence in the entire cross section was calculated up to two times conducted laboratory experiments by jamieson et al 2013 to study the flow field and sediment dynamics in a moving bed channel bend showed that the position of the occurrence of maximum non principle reynolds stress values œÑuv and œÑvw corresponds to the location of the maximum longitudinal velocity tke and erosion 3 1 4 bed shear stress œÑo n m2 estimation of the shear velocity of the bed in open channels is of significant importance to calculate the flow resistance and transport of sediment downstream of the channel there are several methods to calculate this parameter that in the present study was used by balouchi et al 2022 2 œÑ b œÑ bv 2 œÑ bu 2 œÑ bu œÅ g c 2 u u 2 v 2 œÑ bu œÅ g c 2 v u 2 v 2 c 1 n r h 1 6 where œÑb œÑbu and œÑbv are total bed shear stress n m2 and bed

1 h z b z s u d z v 1 h z b z s v d z where h is the water depth m zs and zb are water and bed surface levels m respectively fig 11 shows that with a 50 increase in the relative depth of the flow from 0 3 to 0 55 the maximum bed shear stress in the meandering path of the river decreases by 211 by changing the value from 5 6 to 1 8 n m2 which shows that the boundary between the main section and the floodplain will have a greater effect on the value of bed shear stress at lower relative depths in a constant relative depth of 0 3 the maximum bed shear stress values similar to the velocity pattern fig 6 occurred mainly in the middle of the waterway and on the noses of the inner arch in the main section therefore at lower relative depths the main section of the channel is more exposed to erosion however increasing the relative depth of the maximum bed shear stress values due to the expansion of the high velocity flow cells across the channel occurred toward the inner bend apexes of the floodplain cs01 and cs07 sections fig 11 c and d show the difference in the expansion pattern of the maximum bed shear stress cells at a relative depth of 0 55 for different flow rates of 24 and 61 1 lit s m probably the reason for this phenomenon is the low difference in the values of the depth average velocity of the flow which according to fig 10 has a more uniform state in the width of the channel at a lower flow rate therefore the bed shear stress pattern calculated in fig 11 for the two flow rates is slightly different the results showed that both the relative depth and froud number factors are effective on the occurrence location of the maximum shear stress values in each cross section following the science of sediment hydraulics the increase in shear stress in different locations of each section indicates an increase in the drag force on the sediment particles in the rivers which increases erosion and transfer of sediment downstream in that location similar results have been reported by jamieson et al 2013 strong secondary currents with high momentum transfer between the main channel and the floodplain lead to the creation of a strong gradient in the transverse distribution of average velocity flow kinetic energy and bed shear stress in their intersection the variation trend in the average values of bed shear stress turbulence kinetic energy tke and average kinetic energy mke was decreased with increasing relative flow depth 3 2 sediment transport the value of sediment flux transported downstream was estimated in three tests with froude numbers of 0 262 0 290 and 0 325 and relative depths between 0 3 and 0 55 in this series of tests the cross section of the main channel and floodplain were considered as mobile and fixed beds respectively based on the control test the scouring equilibrium time for each test was considered to be valued at 4 25 h fig 12 showsthatthe value of the total sediment load transported downstream increased greatly with the increase in discharge based on kinetic energy laws in the discussion of hydraulics flow by doubling the flow velocity the kinetic energy and as a result its erosive power quadruples wang et al 2019 here increasing flow to 2 5 times the maximum sediment flux and the total weight of sediment transferred downstream were increased by 3 and 5 respectively the geometric pattern drawn from the topography of the bed is in good agreement with the results presented in the discussion of flow hydraulics contour lines of tke and bed shear stress and vertical velocity with negative values in cs03 are in agreement with the eroded regions fig farzadkho and khazuri 2019 reported that reducing the angle of the bend by reducing the centrifugal force in the bends reduces the sediment near the meandering river bed fig 13 showed the pattern of sediment transport in a meandering channel with a compound cross section was different from the simple increasing flow rate the location of the maximum hole depth was neared the bending apex in the first section cs01 and the peak of the sedimentary hill was moved downstream hook 1975 jamieson et al 2013 showed similar findings increasing by 24 the froude number the sediment hill geometry from a pattern of a sharp nose and short elevation in the cs03 left bank was changed to a pattern of a vast nose and high elevation in the cs03 to cs05 left bank floodplain therefore the volume of sediments deposited in the stagnation area increased by 32 2 table 6 4 conclusion in this study the interaction between hydraulic flow sediment transport and meandering compound channel were investigated considering the parallel wall of the flood plains and the main channel the most important results are as follows in the meandering compound channel with a sinuosity coefficient of 1 3 the inner bending apexes are where the concentration of the maximum longitudinal velocities affected by the centrifugal force was focused with a 50 decrease in the flow relative depth the longitudinal velocity values increased by 19 the development of eddy cores with negative longitudinal velocity on the left bank of the flood plain in sections cs03 to cs07 indicated that flow returned to the upstream direction and with the formation of a low stress flow stagnation area and prone to sedimentation the positive and negative magnitude variations of the transverse and vertical flow velocity components in the main channel and flood plains indicate the presence of eddies and secondary clockwise and counterclockwise flow in these areas it is affected by the parallel wall of the floodplain with the meandering path of the main channel centrifugal force effect and also the interaction of the flow in the intersection of the compound cross section velocity gradient and momentum transfer the average values of shear stress in the channel width constantly decreased as the relative depth increases from 0 3 to 0 46 to 0 55 at the relative depth of 0 55 the maximum bed shear stress values occurred in the inner bend apex of the flood plain however reducing the relative depth causes shifting of the maximum values to the middle of the channel and on the inner bending apex of the main section therefore the main channel will be more exposed to erosion at lower relative depths the ratio of ud fp ud t for the outer and inner bank was a function of the relative depth of the flow which is less and more than one respectively so the flow in the outer floodplain unlike the inner floodplain has a reducing effect on the flow velocity in the main channel the velocity in the main channel is always higher than in the flood plains and the ratio ud fp ud mc was calculated as less than one as the relative depth increases the ratio ud mc ud t decreased and the ratio ud fp ud t increased so the average velocity values in the main channel as well as the floodplains reached the average velocity of the total section the variation trend in the average values of bed shear stress turbulence kinetic energy tke and average kinetic energy mke was decreased with increasing relative flow depth increasing the value flow to 2 5 times the maximum sediment rate and the total sediment transferred downstream were increased by 3 and 5 respectively it indicated a significant increase in the total volume of sediment yield that was transported downstream as the discharge increased the position maximum depth of the hole was neared to the bend apexes in the first section cs01 and the peak of the sedimentary hill was moved away from it the increase in the flow rate changed the geometric characteristic of the sedimentary hill from a sharp nose short height pattern in the low discharge to a wide high peak height pattern therefore with decreasing discharge the volume of sediments deposited in the stagnation area was decreased both factors of relative depth and discharge will be effective on the location of the occurrence of the maximum values of velocity bed shear stress maximum depth hole and peak of the sedimentary hill credit authorship contribution statement sobhan moradi conceptualization methodology investigation
