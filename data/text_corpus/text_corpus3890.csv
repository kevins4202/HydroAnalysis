degradation mahmoudkhani et al 2016 however how the solar irradiation and the ros influence the comprehensive biotoxicity remains unknown although many toxic pollutants can be degraded under solar light the toxic effect of the mixture of transformation products needs to be evaluated because some toxic products like acetaldehyde methylglycine and nitrophenol were reported to form when organic matters exposed to solar light or uv light martijn et al 2014 zhu and kieber 2018 in addition to forming in aquatic environments ros along with reactive nitrogen species rns are also found in cells

of solar irradiation and aquatic ros on pollutants induced intracellular ros and rns levels is investigated 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials sewage effluents were collected at the outlets of three different wwtps in southern china denoted as a b and c different samples collected from the same plants were marked as a1 and a2 the main treatment processes at wwtp a b and c were biological

solar irradiation irradiation was performed according to a previous report wu et al 2016 water samples were placed in quartz tubes natural solar irradiation was conducted by exposing samples to outdoor sunlight in shenzhen 22 35 n 113 58 e china simulated irradiation was achieved with a photochemical reactor xpa 7 xujiang electromechanical plant china in which water samples were exposed to a 1000 w xenon lamp the xenon lamp mainly emitted uv b uv a and visible light fig s1 which is similar to the natural sunlight on the earth surface the intensities of uv and visible light were measured by uv a uv b and visible light irradiance meters beijing normal university photoelectric instrument china respectively 2 3 solid phase extraction samples were concentrated by solid phase extraction spe with a 6 ml oasis hydrophilic lipophilic balance resin cartridge waters usa details of the spe process were reported by du et al 2017 the extracted organics were eluted using methanol 5 ml acetone 2 ml and dichloromethane 2 ml and then blow dried under a nitrogen stream the recovery of doc is 80 85 2 4 aquatic ros measurement generation of aquatic ros including 1o2 o2 h2o2 and oh under solar irradiation was detected by unique probes according to previous publications hsieh et al 2014 zhao and jafvert 2015 each type of ros was determined individually to detect 1o2 o2 and oh probes were added into water samples before irradiation the observed response represented the accumulative generation of each type of ros h2o2 was detected after certain irradiation intervals and the observed response was its instantaneous concentration briefly 1o2 was determined by the decrease of added ffa 0 2 mm and confirmed by adding tba 10 mm tian et al 2017 generation of o2 was monitored by adding nbt2 0 2 mm which uniquely reacts with o2 to form a formazan product with an absorbance maximum at 530 nm sod 40 u ml was added to decompose o2 to further verify that the formazan product originated from the intended reaction h2o2 content was measured through the reaction between h2o2 and dpd 30 mm which was catalyzed by hrp 30 u ml meanwhile to confirm the production of h2o2 it was decomposed by cat 400 1000 u ml before adding dpd and hrp oh was determined by the loss of added tpa 1 μm tba 10 mm was used to quench oh to verify its production detailed information on the aquatic ros measurements is provided in the si 2 5 cell culture and cytotoxicity test a chinese hamster ovary cho k1 cell line obtained from the american type culture collection usa was used for cytotoxicity testing du et al 2017 described the cell culture process in detail briefly cells were cultured in dulbecco s modified eagle s medium gibco usa containing 10 fetal bovine serum gibco 100 u ml penicillin g and 100 μg l streptomycin gibco culture dishes were placed in an incubator sanyo japan containing 5 carbon dioxide and saturated humidity at 37 c the cell viability was tested by adenosine triphosphate assay which had proved to appropriately and authentically reflect the cytotoxicity caused by sewage effluents yang et al 2015 details of the cytotoxicity testing are described in the si briefly cells were seeded in a 96 well plate corning usa and incubated for 12 h then cell cultures were exposed for 48 h to test samples at six concentrations to obtain dose response curves phenol solution was used as the positive control to calculate cytotoxicity equivalents 2 6 intracellular ros and rns measurement cells were seeded into a 96 well microplate 10000 cells well and incubated for 12 h then 50 fold concentrated effluent samples were added the 50 fold concentration was selected because it was around lc50 after cells treated with the samples for 48 h ros and rns tests were conducted intracellular total ros was measured by a ros assay kit ka4075 abnova the culture medium containing the samples was removed firstly then the unique fluorescent probe provided by the kit was added to the microplate 100 μl well after 1 h of staining in the incubator cell images were obtained by a high content analysis hca system imagexpress micro molecular devices usa with the tritc channel fluorescence intensity was analyzed by the software metaxpress provided by the hca system through which the ros intensity per cell was obtained intracellular rns was measured by a rns kit sta 800 oxiselect by adding a fluorescent probe 100 μl well the staining time in the incubator was 1 h cell images were obtained by the hca system with the fitc channel and data analysis was similar to that for ros for certain experiments intracellular ros was scavenged by the anti oxidant l nac 10 nm l nac can directly react with intracellular ros besides l nac is also a precursor of cysteine which maintains the level of anti oxidant glutathione in cells samuni et al 2013 intracellular rns was inhibited by l nna 10 nm park et al 2014 this is because intracellular no is formed by nos facilitating the reaction of substrate l arginine and l nna is a competitor of the enzymatic substrate l arginine cherng et al 2011 simultaneous inhibition of ros and rns was achieved by adding both l nac 10 nm and l nna 10 nm ros and rns scavengers were added with concentrated test samples at the same time 3 results and discussion 3 1 decrease of cytotoxicity by solar light sewage effluents showed different cytotoxicity levels ranging from 6 0 to 9 5 mg phenol l among the five samples fig 1 indicating their potential risk to humans exposed to the effluents natural solar light lowered the cytotoxicity of the samples by 31 after 12 h of irradiation fig 1a the intensity of natural sunlight was shown in fig 1b to better control the experimental conditions more samples were irradiated under simulated solar light spectrum is shown in fig s1 the intensities of simulated visible light and uv light uv a and uv b received by water samples were set as 55 and 1 mw cm2 respectively which were close to the maximum intensities of natural solar light after irradiation with simulated solar light for 12 h cytotoxicity was lowered by 34 65 for the different samples fig 1c f thus solar irradiation could markedly decrease the cytotoxicity of sewage effluents the sewage effluents were cytotoxic because they contained cytotoxic pollutants the decrease of the cytotoxicity of the effluents under solar irradiation might be attributed to the transformation of pollutants to products with lower toxicity the variation of the cytotoxicity decrease induced by solar irradiation between different samples might be caused by their varied pollutant composition photoconversion of pollutants in water has been studied extensively niu et al 2016 wang et al 2016 yuan et al 2016 this study demonstrated that solar light can lower the cytotoxicity resulting from a mixture of pollutants in sewage effluents revealing the importance of solar irradiation in sewage effluents purification 3 2 effect of light wavelength on cytotoxicity reduction to better understand the driving factor for the decrease of cytotoxicity caused by light exposure the individual effects of uv and visible light on effluent cytotoxicity were investigated sample a2 was exposed to simulated solar light shielded by a uv or visible filter after irradiation for 12 h uv light markedly lowered the cytotoxicity of the sample by 3 9 mg phenol l 52 removal while visible light had almost no effect fig 2 a besides sample a2 irradiated under the uv light emitted by a mercury lamp also showed a similar trend fig 2b thus it was demonstrated that uv light played a major role in decreasing the cytotoxicity of sewage effluents the reason that cytotoxicity was mainly lowered by uv irradiation rather than visible light could be explained by the absorption behavior of the sewage effluents the effluents only absorbed light in the uv region 400 nm fig s2 micropollutants in effluents with aromatic rings or other unsaturated bonds generally show uv absorbance shu et al 2013 many toxic pollutants like diclofenac naproxen and benzothiazoles are efficiently removed under uv irradiation bahnmueller et al 2015 shu et al 2013 pollutants might undergo direct photolysis when they absorb uv light niu et al 2016 moreover dissolved organic matter in sewage effluents also absorbs uv light aquatic ros originating from the photosensitization of dissolved organic matter and pollutants might also contribute to pollutant degradation yuan et al 2016 3 3 formation of aquatic ros under irradiation the presence of four kinds of important aquatic ros including 1o2 o2 oh and h2o2 were determined by specific chemical probes the concentration of ffa used as a probe for 1o2 decreased considerably during irradiation fig 3 a suggesting the production of 1o2 in sewage effluents under solar irradiation 1o2 might form through dissolved oxygen reacting with triplet organic matter excited by solar light cristale et al 2017 when the 1o2 scavenger tba was added to the system the decrease of ffa content was inhibited further demonstrating the generation of 1o2 the formation of o2 was monitored by the absorbance of a formazan product at 530 nm resulting from the unique reaction between nbt2 and o2 ballatore et al 2015 during irradiation the absorbance of the sample at 530 nm increased markedly fig 3b in contrast the dark control showed no increase in absorbance indicating the formation of o2 occurred during irradiation o2 might originate from dissolved oxygen accepting e aq excited by solar light zhang et al 2014 sod can catalyze the disproportionation reaction of o2 to form h2o2 and oxygen diaz et al 2016 by adding sod into the water sample the formation of the formazan product was strongly inhibited further suggesting the generation of o2 in sewage effluents under solar irradiation the formation of o2 implied that h2o2 was also present because h2o2 mainly originates from o2 belousov et al 2016 h2o2 can be formed through either the disproportionation reaction of o2 mentioned above or by o2 extracting a proton to form a hydroperoxyl radical ho2 and then h2o2 zhao and jafvert 2015 the formation of h2o2 was determined using dpd a micromolar level of h2o2 was observed during irradiation fig 3c moreover h2o2 was not detected when cat was added to catalyze its decomposition further indicating the formation of h2o2 in the sewage effluents meanwhile oh might be formed through the photolysis of h2o2 russo et al 2017 the production of oh was evidenced by the decrease of selective probe tpa georgiou et al 2015 during irradiation tpa content decreased in contrast tpa content remained constant under dark conditions fig 3d indicating the production of oh in the samples during irradiation the addition of oh scavenger tba inhibited the decrease of tpa concentration lv et al 2016 which further suggested the formation of oh in sewage effluents under solar irradiation 3 4 contribution of aquatic ros to the reduction of pollutants induced cytotoxicity aquatic ros are strong oxidants that can efficiently degrade organic pollutants the aquatic ros formed in sewage effluents under irradiation might play an important role in the removal of cytotoxic pollutants leading to the observed decrease of cytotoxicity during irradiation to investigate the role of aquatic ros in lowering pollutants induced cytotoxicity a ros scavenger was added to the sewage effluents during irradiation although reagents like sodium azide and benzoquinone are widely used as ros scavengers some of them are toxic and thus interfering with cytotoxicity measurements du et al 2013 the scavenger tba would not alter the cytotoxicity because it is not retained during the spe pretreatment fig s3 in addition tba did not interfere with the absorbance of the sewage effluents fig s4 therefore tba was used as the scavenger for aquatic ros fig 4 a shows the influence of different tba doses on the reduction of pollutants induced cytotoxicity without tba cytotoxicity decreased by 2 7 mg phenol l 42 removal after 12 h of irradiation the cytotoxicity decrease was inhibited by the addition of tba and the inhibition effect was enhanced with increasing tba dose cytotoxicity only decreased by 1 3 mg phenol l 20 removal when 10 mm tba was added inhibition of the cytotoxicity decrease caused by tba at different irradiation times was also investigated marked suppression was observed during the irradiation process when 10 mm tba was added fig 4b it should be noted that tba could not completely quench the aquatic ros fig 3a and d the actual contribution of aquatic ros to cytotoxicity reduction should be higher than that shown in fig 4 besides l histidine is a proper 1o2 quencher boreen et al 2008 the absorbance spectra of l histidine cytotoxicity of l histidine and influence of adding l histidine on cytotoxicity reduction under irradiation were shown in figs s5 s7 adding l histidine also inhibited the cytotoxicity reduction under solar irradiation cytotoxic pollutants would undergo direct photolysis carlson et al 2015 besides other reactive species formed under solar irradiation like triplet state dom and e aq might also contribute to the degradation of toxic pollutants gerecke et al 2001 jeong et al 2010 here we demonstrated that the degradation of cytotoxic pollutants induced by indirect photolysis via aquatic ros was considerable based on the above discussion a pathway of aquatic ros formation and cytotoxic pollutant degradation was proposed and is illustrated in fig 5 ballatore et al 2015 belousov et al 2016 latch and mcneill 2006 zhao and jafvert 2015 3 5 roles of intracellular ros and rns in pollutants induced cytotoxicity previous studies have demonstrated the elevation of intracellular oxidative stress in cytotoxicity process induced by xenobiotics pals et al 2013 changes of intracellular ros and rns when cells were exposed to pollutants in sewage effluents were investigated furthermore intracellular ros and rns scavengers were added to cell cultures to investigate the role of intracellular ros and rns in pollutants induced cytotoxicity the 10 nm anti oxidant n acetylcysteine l nac was used to quench intracellular ros and 10 nm nitroarginine l nna was used to inhibit the formation of rns the concentration used here was because it showed no cytotoxicity to cho cells fig s8 when cells were exposed to 50 fold concentrated samples around lc50 the sewage effluents showed considerable cytotoxicity the inhibition of cell viability was 53 fig 6 both intracellular ros and rns levels were markedly elevated compared with those of the negative control after adding l nac intracellular ros substantially decreased but the inhibition of viability only decreased to 43 similarly when l nna was added intracellular rns decreased markedly but the inhibition of viability only decreased slightly these results indicate that inhibiting ros and rns individually was not enough to limit the cytotoxicity of sewage effluents when l nac and l nna were added simultaneously both intracellular ros and rns levels were decreased considerably and the inhibition of cell viability decreased substantially to 21 indicating that a considerable cytotoxicity was mitigated therefore it is clearly that sewage effluents induced cytotoxicity via elevating both intracellular ros and rns levels the result that inhibiting ros and rns alone was not enough to mitigate sewage effluents induced cytotoxicity is inconsistent with the cytotoxicity caused by some individual xenobiotics scavenging intracellular ros alone almost completely mitigated the cytotoxicity induced by halobenzoquinones du et al 2013 also quenching intracellular peroxynitrite one kind of rns alone could totally detoxified the cytotoxicity caused by seleno l methionine maraldi et al 2011 these results suggested sewage effluent induced cytotoxicity is rather more complex than that of individual pollutant the mixture of cytotoxic pollutants in sewage effluents triggers both ros and rns to attack biomacromolecules intracellular ros might react with intracellular rns for example o2 could react with no to form onoo which further produces daughter radicals like oh and no2 to attack biomacromolecules dedon and tannenbaum 2004 this might explain why scavenging ros or rns alone could reduce cytotoxicity to some degree besides ros or rns has its independent way to attack biomacromolecules dedon and tannenbaum 2004 that might be why only scavenging both intracellular ros and rns could substantially mitigate the cytotoxicity 3 6 influence of aquatic ros on pollutants induced intracellular ros and rns changes of intracellular ros and rns when cells were exposed to irradiated sewage effluents were investigated cells were exposed to 50 fold concentrated around ec50 samples irradiated by solar light for different periods compared with the cells exposed to the non irradiated pollutants ros and rns of cells exposed to the irradiated pollutants reduced simultaneously furthermore increasing the solar irradiation time increased the ros and rns reduction fig 7 a and b besides the influence of aquatic ros on pollutants induced intracellular ros and rns levels was also investigated tba was used to scavenge the aquatic ros for cells exposed to the tba scavenged sewage effluents the decrease of the intracellular ros and rns caused by pollutants was markedly inhibited compared with the case for the non scavenged effluent fig 7a and b the decrease of the pollutants induced intracellular ros and rns levels might result from the phototransformation of toxic pollutants to none low cytotoxic products aquatic ros contributed to the decrease of pollutants induced intracellular ros and rns because it facilitated the degradation of cytotoxic pollutants individual pollutant with lower toxicity generally induced a lower intracellular ros level chao et al 2014 besides positive correlations were found between cytotoxicity genotoxicity and the ability of toxins to cause oxidative stress n acetylcysteine thiol reactivity during wastewater chlorination chloramination and ozonation dong et al 2017 thus solar light detoxified the sewage effluents because it could lower pollutants induced intracellular ros and rns levels simultaneously also irradiation induced aquatic ros were responsible for part of the cytotoxicity decrease because they contributed to the degradation of toxic pollutants 4 conclusions solar light plays an important role in altering water quality during the storage of sewage effluents influence of solar irradiation on cytotoxicity of sewage effluents was investigated the main conclusions are summarized below 1 natural solar light could reduce the cytotoxicity of sewage effluents to cho cells under 12 h irradiation of simulated solar light 55 mw cm2 visible light and 1 mw cm2 uv light cytotoxicity was lowered by 34 65 for different water samples uv light was responsible for the major reduction of cytotoxicity 2 aquatic ros including 1o2 o2 oh and h2o2 were evidenced to form in sewage effluents under solar irradiation by adding the tba as scavenger of aquatic ros it was demonstrated that aquatic ros contributed to the reduction of cytotoxicity 3 toxic pollutants in sewage effluents increased the intracellular ros and rns in cho cells by adding the intracellular ros scavenger l nac and intracellular rns inhibitor l nna it was found that pollutants caused cytotoxicity to cho cells by simultaneously increasing intracellular ros and rns 4 solar irradiation detoxified the sewage effluents because it simultaneously lowered pollutants induced intracellular ros and rns contents furthermore irradiation induced aquatic ros contributed to the degradation of toxic pollutants lowering intracellular ros and rns then reducing the cytotoxicity of sewage

testing du et al 2017 described the cell culture process in detail briefly cells were cultured in dulbecco s modified eagle s medium gibco usa containing 10 fetal bovine serum gibco 100 u ml penicillin g and 100 μg l streptomycin gibco culture dishes were placed in an incubator sanyo japan containing 5 carbon dioxide and saturated humidity at 37 c the cell viability was tested by adenosine triphosphate assay which had proved to appropriately and authentically reflect the cytotoxicity caused by sewage effluents yang et al 2015 details of the cytotoxicity testing are described in the si briefly cells were seeded in a 96 well plate corning usa and incubated for 12 h then cell cultures were exposed for 48 h to test samples at six concentrations to obtain dose response curves phenol solution was used as the positive control to calculate cytotoxicity equivalents 2 6 intracellular ros and rns measurement cells were seeded into a 96 well microplate 10000 cells well and incubated for 12 h then 50 fold concentrated effluent samples were added the 50 fold concentration was selected because it was around lc50 after cells treated with the samples for 48 h ros and rns tests were conducted intracellular total ros was measured by a ros assay kit ka4075 abnova the culture medium containing the samples was removed firstly then the unique fluorescent probe provided by the kit was added to the microplate 100 μl well after 1 h of staining in the incubator cell images were obtained by a high content analysis hca system imagexpress micro molecular devices usa with the tritc channel fluorescence intensity was analyzed by the software metaxpress provided by the hca system through which the ros intensity per cell was obtained intracellular rns was measured by a rns kit sta 800 oxiselect by adding a fluorescent probe 100 μl well the staining time in the incubator was 1 h cell images were obtained by the hca system with the fitc channel and data analysis was similar to that for ros for certain experiments intracellular ros was scavenged by the anti oxidant l nac 10 nm l nac can directly react with intracellular ros besides l nac is also a precursor of cysteine which maintains the level of anti oxidant glutathione in cells samuni et al 2013 intracellular rns was inhibited by l nna 10 nm park et al 2014 this is because intracellular no is formed by nos facilitating the reaction of substrate l arginine and l nna is a competitor of the enzymatic substrate l arginine cherng et al 2011 simultaneous inhibition of ros and rns was achieved by adding both l nac 10 nm and l nna 10 nm ros and rns scavengers were added with concentrated test samples at the same time 3 results and discussion 3 1 decrease of cytotoxicity by solar light sewage effluents showed different cytotoxicity levels ranging from 6 0 to 9 5 mg phenol l among the five samples fig 1 indicating their potential risk to humans exposed to the effluents natural solar light lowered the cytotoxicity of the samples by 31 after 12 h of irradiation fig 1a the intensity of natural sunlight was shown in fig 1b to better control the experimental conditions more samples were irradiated under simulated solar light spectrum is shown in fig s1 the intensities of simulated visible light and uv light uv a and uv b received by water samples were set as 55 and 1 mw cm2 respectively which were close to the maximum intensities of natural solar light after irradiation with simulated solar light for 12 h cytotoxicity was lowered by 34 65 for the different samples fig 1c f thus solar irradiation could markedly decrease the cytotoxicity of sewage effluents the sewage effluents were cytotoxic because they contained cytotoxic pollutants the decrease of the cytotoxicity of the effluents under solar irradiation might be attributed to the transformation of pollutants to products with lower toxicity the variation of the cytotoxicity decrease induced by solar irradiation between different samples might be caused by their varied pollutant composition photoconversion of pollutants in water has been studied extensively niu et al 2016 wang et al 2016 yuan et al 2016 this study demonstrated that solar light can lower the cytotoxicity resulting from a mixture of pollutants in sewage effluents revealing the importance of solar irradiation in sewage effluents purification 3 2 effect of light wavelength on cytotoxicity reduction to better understand the driving factor for the decrease of cytotoxicity caused by light exposure the individual effects of uv and visible light on effluent cytotoxicity were investigated sample a2 was exposed to simulated solar light shielded by a uv or visible filter after irradiation for 12 h uv light markedly lowered the cytotoxicity of the sample by 3 9 mg phenol l 52 removal while visible light had almost no effect fig 2 a besides sample a2 irradiated under the uv light emitted by a mercury lamp also showed a similar trend fig 2b thus it was demonstrated that uv light played a major role in decreasing the cytotoxicity of sewage effluents the reason that cytotoxicity was mainly lowered by uv irradiation rather than visible light could be explained by the absorption behavior of the sewage effluents the effluents only absorbed light in the uv region 400 nm fig s2 micropollutants in effluents with aromatic rings or other unsaturated bonds generally show uv absorbance shu et al 2013 many toxic pollutants like diclofenac naproxen and benzothiazoles are efficiently removed under uv irradiation bahnmueller et al 2015 shu et al 2013 pollutants might undergo direct photolysis when they absorb uv light niu et al 2016 moreover dissolved organic matter in sewage effluents also absorbs uv light aquatic ros originating from the photosensitization of dissolved organic matter and pollutants might also contribute to pollutant degradation yuan et al 2016 3 3 formation of aquatic ros under irradiation the presence of four kinds of important aquatic ros including 1o2 o2 oh and h2o2 were determined by specific chemical probes the concentration of ffa used as a probe for 1o2 decreased considerably during irradiation fig 3 a suggesting the production of 1o2 in sewage effluents under solar irradiation 1o2 might form through dissolved oxygen reacting with triplet organic matter excited by solar light cristale et al 2017 when the 1o2 scavenger tba was added to the system the decrease of ffa content was inhibited further demonstrating the generation of 1o2 the formation of o2 was monitored by the absorbance of a formazan product at 530 nm resulting from the unique reaction between nbt2 and o2 ballatore et al 2015 during irradiation the absorbance of the sample at 530 nm increased markedly fig 3b in contrast the dark control showed no increase in absorbance indicating the formation of o2 occurred during irradiation o2 might originate from dissolved oxygen accepting e aq excited by solar light zhang et al 2014 sod can catalyze the disproportionation reaction of o2 to form h2o2 and oxygen diaz et al 2016 by adding sod into the water sample the formation of the formazan product was strongly inhibited further suggesting the generation of o2 in sewage effluents under solar irradiation the formation of o2 implied that h2o2 was also present because h2o2 mainly originates from o2 belousov et al 2016 h2o2 can be formed through either the disproportionation reaction of o2 mentioned above or by o2 extracting a proton to form a hydroperoxyl radical ho2 and then h2o2 zhao and jafvert 2015 the formation of h2o2 was determined using dpd a micromolar level of h2o2 was observed during irradiation fig 3c moreover h2o2 was not detected when cat was added to catalyze its decomposition further indicating the formation of h2o2 in the sewage effluents meanwhile oh might be formed through the photolysis of h2o2 russo et al 2017 the production of oh was evidenced by the decrease of selective probe tpa georgiou et al 2015 during irradiation tpa content decreased in contrast tpa content remained constant under dark conditions fig 3d indicating the production of oh in the samples during irradiation the addition of oh scavenger tba inhibited the decrease of tpa concentration lv et al 2016 which further suggested the formation of oh in sewage effluents under solar irradiation 3 4 contribution of aquatic ros to the reduction of pollutants induced cytotoxicity aquatic ros are strong oxidants that can efficiently degrade organic pollutants the aquatic ros formed in sewage effluents under irradiation might play an important role in the removal of cytotoxic pollutants leading to the observed decrease of cytotoxicity during irradiation to investigate the role of aquatic ros in lowering pollutants induced cytotoxicity a ros scavenger was added to the sewage effluents during irradiation although reagents like sodium azide and benzoquinone are widely used as ros scavengers some of them are toxic and thus interfering with cytotoxicity measurements du et al 2013 the scavenger tba would not alter the cytotoxicity because it is not retained during the spe pretreatment fig s3 in addition tba did not interfere with the absorbance of the sewage effluents fig s4 therefore tba was used as the scavenger for aquatic ros fig 4 a shows the influence of different tba doses on the reduction of pollutants induced cytotoxicity without tba cytotoxicity decreased by 2 7 mg phenol l 42 removal after 12 h of irradiation the cytotoxicity decrease was inhibited by the addition of tba and the inhibition effect was enhanced with increasing tba dose cytotoxicity only decreased by 1 3 mg phenol l 20 removal when 10 mm tba was added inhibition of the cytotoxicity decrease caused by tba at different irradiation times was also investigated marked suppression was observed during the irradiation process when 10 mm tba was added fig 4b it should be noted that tba could not completely quench the aquatic ros fig 3a and d the actual contribution of aquatic ros to cytotoxicity reduction should be higher than that shown in fig 4 besides l histidine is a proper 1o2 quencher boreen et al 2008 the absorbance spectra of l histidine cytotoxicity of l histidine and influence of adding l histidine on cytotoxicity reduction under irradiation were shown in figs s5 s7 adding l histidine also inhibited the cytotoxicity reduction under solar irradiation cytotoxic pollutants would undergo direct photolysis carlson et al 2015 besides other reactive species formed under solar irradiation like triplet state dom and e aq might also contribute to the degradation of toxic pollutants gerecke et al 2001 jeong et al 2010 here we demonstrated that the degradation of cytotoxic pollutants induced by indirect photolysis via aquatic ros was considerable based on the above discussion a pathway of aquatic ros formation and cytotoxic pollutant degradation was proposed and is illustrated in fig 5 ballatore et al 2015 belousov et al 2016 latch and mcneill 2006 zhao and jafvert 2015 3 5 roles of intracellular ros and rns in pollutants induced cytotoxicity previous studies have demonstrated the elevation of intracellular oxidative stress in cytotoxicity process induced by xenobiotics pals et al 2013 changes of intracellular ros and rns when cells were exposed to pollutants in sewage effluents were investigated furthermore intracellular ros and rns scavengers were added to cell cultures to investigate the role of intracellular ros and rns in pollutants induced cytotoxicity the 10 nm anti oxidant n acetylcysteine l nac was used to quench intracellular ros and 10 nm nitroarginine l nna was used to inhibit the formation of rns the concentration used here was because it showed no cytotoxicity to cho cells fig s8 when cells were exposed to 50 fold concentrated samples around lc50 the sewage effluents showed considerable cytotoxicity the inhibition of cell viability was 53 fig 6 both intracellular ros and rns levels were markedly elevated compared with those of the negative control after adding l nac intracellular ros substantially decreased but the inhibition of viability only decreased to 43 similarly when l nna was added intracellular rns decreased markedly but the inhibition of viability only decreased slightly these results indicate that inhibiting ros and rns individually was not enough to limit the cytotoxicity of sewage effluents when l nac and l nna were added simultaneously both intracellular ros and rns levels were decreased considerably and the inhibition of cell viability decreased substantially to 21 indicating that a considerable cytotoxicity was mitigated therefore it is clearly that sewage effluents induced cytotoxicity via elevating both intracellular ros and rns levels the result that inhibiting ros and rns alone was not enough to mitigate sewage effluents induced cytotoxicity is inconsistent with the cytotoxicity caused by some individual xenobiotics scavenging intracellular ros alone almost completely mitigated the cytotoxicity induced by halobenzoquinones du et al 2013 also quenching intracellular peroxynitrite one kind of rns alone could totally detoxified the cytotoxicity caused by seleno l methionine maraldi et al 2011 these results suggested sewage effluent induced cytotoxicity is rather more complex than that of individual pollutant the mixture of cytotoxic pollutants in sewage effluents triggers both ros and rns to attack biomacromolecules intracellular ros might react with intracellular rns for example o2 could react with no to form onoo which further produces daughter radicals like oh and no2 to attack biomacromolecules dedon and tannenbaum 2004 this might explain why scavenging ros or rns alone could reduce cytotoxicity to some degree besides ros or rns has its independent way to attack biomacromolecules dedon and tannenbaum 2004 that might be why only scavenging both intracellular ros and rns could substantially mitigate the cytotoxicity 3 6 influence of aquatic ros on pollutants induced intracellular ros and rns changes of intracellular ros and rns when cells were exposed to irradiated sewage effluents were investigated cells were exposed to 50 fold concentrated around ec50 samples irradiated by solar light for different periods compared with the cells exposed to the non irradiated pollutants ros and rns of cells exposed to the irradiated pollutants reduced simultaneously furthermore increasing the solar irradiation time increased the ros and rns reduction fig 7 a and b besides the influence of aquatic ros on pollutants induced intracellular ros and rns levels was also investigated tba was used to scavenge the aquatic ros for cells exposed to the tba scavenged sewage effluents the decrease of the intracellular ros and rns caused by pollutants was markedly inhibited compared with the case for the non scavenged effluent fig 7a and b the decrease of the pollutants induced intracellular ros and rns levels might result from the phototransformation of toxic pollutants to none low cytotoxic products aquatic ros contributed to the decrease of pollutants induced intracellular ros and rns because it facilitated the degradation of cytotoxic pollutants individual pollutant with lower toxicity generally induced a lower intracellular ros level chao et al 2014 besides positive correlations were found between cytotoxicity genotoxicity and the ability of toxins to cause oxidative stress n acetylcysteine thiol reactivity during wastewater chlorination chloramination and ozonation dong et al 2017 thus solar light detoxified the sewage effluents because it could lower pollutants induced intracellular ros and rns levels simultaneously also irradiation induced aquatic ros were responsible for part of the cytotoxicity decrease because they contributed to the degradation of toxic pollutants 4 conclusions solar light plays an important role in altering water quality during the storage of sewage effluents influence of solar irradiation on cytotoxicity of sewage effluents was investigated the main conclusions are summarized below 1 natural solar light could reduce the cytotoxicity of sewage effluents to cho cells under 12 h irradiation of simulated solar light 55 mw cm2 visible light and 1 mw cm2 uv light cytotoxicity was lowered by 34 65 for different water samples uv light was responsible for the major reduction of cytotoxicity 2 aquatic ros including 1o2 o2 oh and h2o2 were evidenced to form in sewage effluents under solar irradiation by adding the tba as scavenger of aquatic ros it was demonstrated that aquatic ros contributed to the reduction of cytotoxicity 3 toxic pollutants in sewage effluents increased the intracellular ros and rns in cho cells by adding the intracellular ros scavenger l nac and intracellular rns inhibitor l nna it was found that pollutants caused cytotoxicity to cho cells by simultaneously increasing intracellular ros and rns 4 solar irradiation detoxified the sewage effluents because it simultaneously lowered pollutants induced intracellular ros and rns contents furthermore irradiation induced aquatic ros contributed to the degradation of toxic pollutants lowering intracellular ros and rns then reducing the cytotoxicity of sewage

19451,treatment of fully nitrified municipal wastewater effluents with chlorine followed by chloramines i e sequential chlorine disinfection upstream of advanced treatment trains can contribute pathogen inactivation credits for potable reuse while leaving a chloramine residual to control biofouling on membrane units in the advanced treatment train however free chlorine exposures must be optimized to maximize pathogen inactivation while minimizing the formation of disinfection byproducts dbps that are challenging to remove in the advanced treatment train using a pilot scale disinfection contactor receiving fully nitrified tertiary municipal wastewater effluent this study found that a 3 mg min l free chlorine ct i e the product of the chlorine residual c and the contact time t followed by a 140 mg min l chloramine ct could reliably achieve 5 log inactivation of ms2 bacteriophage and reduce median total coliform concentrations below 2 2 mpn 100 ml free chlorine disinfection was equally effective when chlorine was dosed to exceed the breakpoint for 1 mg l of ammonia as n at this free chlorine exposure regulated trihalomethane thm and haloacetic acid haa formation remained below their maximum contaminant levels mcls but ndma concentrations of 30 ng l were above the 10 ng l california notification level increasing the free chlorine exposure to 30 mg min l increased thm and haa formation with regulated thms approaching or exceeding the mcl although this free chlorine exposure prevented ndma formation during chloramination the 10 ng l background ndma formation in the tertiary effluent remained increasing the free chlorine exposure also increased the formation of unregulated halogenated dbp classes that may be significant contributors to the dbp associated toxicity of the disinfected wastewater the results indicate that sequential chlorination can be used to optimize the benefits of free chlorine virus and ndma control and chloramine disinfection thm haa and coliform control graphical abstract image 1 keywords sequential chlorination potable reuse virus coliform ndma halogenated dbps 1 introduction providing a safe water supply requires controlling exposure to both microbial pathogens and toxic chemicals nrc 2012 olivieri et al 2016 pecson et al 2015 tchobanoglous et al 2015 while high disinfectant doses can reduce the acute risk posed by pathogens they increase the chronic risk associated with the formation of potentially carcinogenic disinfection byproducts dbps balancing these risks is an important challenge for disinfection yet previous studies have infrequently characterized the tradeoffs between pathogen inactivation and dbp formation as a function of disinfectant exposure li and mitch 2018 given the high concentrations of both pathogens and dbp precursors in municipal sewage optimizing this balance is even more challenging for the potable reuse of wastewaters the high levels of pathogen inactivation required for indirect potable reuse ipr systems are typically achieved through a combination of multiple unit treatment processes and an environmental buffer e g an aquifer cadph 2014a ddw 2017 twdb 2015 across the country there is growing interest in the expanded implementation of direct potable reuse dpr where advanced treatment train effluents are routed directly to drinking water systems without passing through environmental buffers gerrity et al 2013 in these scenarios however the pathogen inactivation credits associated with the environmental buffers must then be supplied elsewhere in the treatment train while attention has focused on pathogen inactivation within the advanced treatment trains disinfection of the wastewater influents to these trains could also contribute to the pathogen inactivation credits at many current ipr advanced water treatment facilities awtf the chloramines applied to the advanced treatment train influents to control biofilm growth on microfiltration mf and reverse osmosis ro membranes may be the first disinfectant exposure for the wastewater however the pathogen inactivation achieved by these chloramines is minimal given the low disinfectant potency of chloramines and the short exposure time minutes because many of these facilities receive nitrified municipal wastewater effluents an alternative is to apply a short free chlorine exposure followed by ammonia addition to form chloramines i e sequential chlorination upstream of the mf and ro membranes in the advanced treatment train huitric et al 2014 maguin et al 2009 free chlorine exposure would enhance the inactivation of pathogens particularly viruses sobsey et al 1988 shin and sobsey 1998 cromeans et al 2010 chloramination would promote coliform inactivation berman et al 1988 while the residual chloramines would control biofouling on mf and ro membranes however the free chlorine exposure should be optimized to balance pathogen inactivation against the formation of dbps the national research council indicated that dbps are important contaminants of concern for potable reuse with concentrations in reuse effluents far closer to levels of potential human health concern than pharmaceuticals nrc 2012 utilities practicing potable reuse must meet existing drinking water regulatory limits on dbps these limits include the 80 μg l maximum contaminant level mcl for four trihalomethanes thm4 chloroform bromodichloromethane dibromochloromethane and bromoform and the 60 μg l mcl for five haloacetic acids haa5 chloroacetic acid bromoacetic acid dichloroacetic acid dibromoacetic acid and trichloroacetic acid in the u s us epa 2017 and the 10 ng l notification levels for three n nitrosamines n nitrosodimethylamine ndma n nitrosodiethylamine and n nitrosodipropylamine in california cswrcb 2017 ndma has been a particular challenge for potable reuse due to its occurrence in domestic zeng and mitch 2015 and industrial sewage sedlak et al 2005 the association of its precursors with wastewater zeng et al 2016a and its formation during chloramination schreiber and mitch 2006 advanced oxidation process aop systems in advanced water treatment trains are typically designed to remove ndma gerrity et al 2013 however ro and aop systems are only partially successful at removing low molecular weight uncharged halogenated dbps e g thms zeng et al 2016b dbp formation within dpr treatment trains is likely to be even more important than in ipr treatment trains due to the lack of dbp removal within environmental buffers thus optimization of the free chlorine exposure is needed to maximize pathogen inactivation while avoiding excessive formation of dbps that are challenging to remove within the subsequent advanced treatment train the first objective of this study was to characterize the efficacy of sequential chlorination for inactivation of pathogen surrogates during pilot scale treatment of a fully nitrified filtered tertiary municipal wastewater effluent the second objective was to characterize the tradeoffs between pathogen surrogate inactivation and dbp formation as a function of free chlorine exposure during sequential chlorination for wastewater reuse the third objective was to characterize the tradeoffs between the formation of different dbp classes although oxidants other than free chlorine could achieve pathogen inactivation and control specific dbp classes shah et al 2012 this study focused on free chlorine because it can be applied to nitrified wastewater effluents without the addition of other process units previous research with drinking water demonstrated that increasing the free chlorine exposure can reduce ndma formation during subsequent chloramination by deactivating ndma precursors charrois and hrudey 2007 shah et al 2012 however increasing the free chlorine exposure increases the formation of halogenated dbps such as thm4 and haa5 shah et al 2012 this study evaluated these tradeoffs in nitrified municipal wastewater for regulated dbps and for several unregulated halogenated dbp classes including iodinated thms haloacetonitriles haloacetamides haloacetaldehydes and haloketones toxicological assays have indicated that these classes can exhibit significantly higher cytotoxicity and genotoxicity than the constituents of thm4 and haa5 wagner and plewa 2017 for all three objectives this study also evaluated the effect of an upset to the biological nitrification process by raising the pilot unit influent ammonia concentration from 0 1 mg l as n to 1 mg l as n the ammonia challenge condition under these conditions this study evaluated the effects on pathogen surrogate inactivation and dbp formation of increasing the free chlorine dose to exceed the breakpoint and leave the same target free chlorine residual 2 materials and methods 2 1 pilot system the pilot scale disinfection system consisted of one 3 inch diameter 80 foot long pvc pipe section and one 10 inch diameter 80 foot long pvc pipe section each with 10 equally spaced sample ports fig 1 a nitrified filtered municipal wastewater effluent that had not been previously exposed to disinfectants served as the influent to the pilot unit two reagent injection ports were located upstream of each pipe section each followed by a static mixer at the 10 gpm influent flowrate to the pilot unit a rhodamine wt tracer test indicated a 2 8 min modal contact time at the end of the 3 inch section and a 35 5 min modal contact time at the end of the 10 inch section peristaltic pumps fed reagents from two different storage tanks through the injection ports the reagents included the treatment facility s 12 5 by weight sodium hypochlorite stock solution diluted 3 fold with tap water to facilitate dosing control and a 22 5 by weight ammonium sulfate solution in tap water a third storage tank was used to mix the ms2 bacteriophage stock solution with influent tertiary wastewater effluent see below inline meters measured ph temperature flow and turbidity the free chlorine dosing control system used feedback from inline free chlorine meters analytical technology inc collegeville pa located at the first and last sample ports on the 3 inch pipe to ensure the maintenance of specific free chlorine residuals 1 5 4 0 mg l as cl2 at the end of the 3 inch pipe grab samples were collected for measurement of total chlorine residual and total ammonia hach sl1000 portable parallel analyzer 2 2 microbial inactivation testing microbial inactivation was evaluated using seeded f specific ms2 bacteriophage and native total coliform for ms2 testing a ms2 bacteriophage stock solution prepared by biovir laboratories benicia ca was added to a 1000 gallon tank filled with filtered tertiary wastewater effluent to achieve a concentration of 1 107 plaque forming units per milliliter pfu ml ms2 testing was conducted over four days with three different water qualities 1 unamended filter effluent as the feed water control samples 3 sampling days with typically 0 1 mg l as n ammonia and 0 4 1 4 ntu turbidity 2 filter effluent amended with ammonia 3 sampling days with 0 9 1 5 mg l as n ammonia and 3 filter effluent amended with particulates to increase the turbidity two sampling days with 1 2 1 6 ntu turbidity the challenge tests with ammonia and turbidity were designed to represent worst case conditions with regard to both of these parameters during ammonia challenge tests the free chlorine dose was increased to exceed the breakpoint and maintain the target free chlorine residual at the end of the 3 inch pipe during turbidity challenge tests backwash water from a tertiary media filter was added to the 1000 gallon tank to achieve given ntu target levels in addition to particulates this backwash likely contained some additional dissolved organic matter following ms2 seeding and any turbidity addition the 1000 gallon tank was pump mixed for at least three hydraulic residence times to ensure adequate mixing and time for interactions between ms2 and waterborne particulates the pilot disinfection system was fed from the 1000 gallon tank at a flowrate of 10 gpm over the 4 days of testing 210 ms2 samples were collected at various sample points along the 3 inch pvc pipe section and measured for free chlorine residual and infective ms2 concentrations virus samples were collected in sterile tubes containing an excess of sodium thiosulfate to quench residual disinfectant infective ms2 concentrations were determined using the double layer agar method a modification of u s epa method 1602 adams 1959 in the trussell tech laboratory in pasadena ca native total coliform samples were collected four times per week from february 13 through june 15 2017 from four locations along the pipeline contactor 1 prior to chlorine injection 2 after the 3 inch section 3 half way through the 10 inch section and 4 at the end of the 10 inch section total coliform was measured using standard method 9223 note that ammonia was added after the 3 inch section to convert the free chlorine into a chloramine residual chloramines were maintained throughout the 10 inch section allowing for quantification of the total coliform inactivation through the sequential process 2 3 dbp formation experiments dbp experiments were conducted separately from the ms2 experiments because the ms2 stock was stored in an organic rich growth medium that might impact dbp concentrations compared to the unamended wastewater effluent dbp experiments were fully repeated on two different days on each day a series of samples representing different free chlorine exposures were collected with 1 unamended fully nitrified effluent 0 1 mg l as n ammonia and 2 effluent amended with 1 0 mg l as n ammonia i e ammonia challenge tests during ammonia challenge tests the free chlorine dose was increased to exceed the breakpoint and maintain a defined free chlorine residual background levels of dbps and other water quality parameters were measured in samples collected from a sample port upstream of the 3 inch pipe section experimental samples were collected from the last sample port on the 3 inch pipe and three sample ports on the 10 inch pipe representing 2 8 8 3 22 1 and 35 5 min of modal contact time respectively during these experiments ammonia was not injected between the 3 inch and 10 inch pipes in order to maintain a free chlorine residual throughout the system the free chlorine residual was measured at each sample port prior to and after sample collection the average of these values was multiplied by the modal contact time corresponding to each port to calculate the free chlorine exposure for most experiments involving free chlorine contact sample bottles used to collect dbp samples contained ammonium chloride at a 1 2 chlorine to ammonia molar ratio to convert the free chlorine to chloramines these samples were transported at ambient temperature back to the laboratory at stanford and held at 20 c for 24 h before quenching the chloramine residual with 33 mg l ascorbic acid and analysis these samples were meant to simulate conditions of a recycled water that 1 had been treated with an initial free chlorine exposure 2 had been converted to chloramine through ammonia addition and 3 had traveled within a distribution system with a chloramine residual for a 24 h period during the first sampling event for effluent without ammonia addition another set of samples was collected in bottles prepared with 33 mg l ascorbic acid to isolate the dbp formation resulting from free chlorine exposure alone these samples were transported on ice to the laboratory and stored at 4 c before analysis dissolved organic carbon doc was measured with a shimadzu toc vcsh total organic carbon analyzer uv absorbance at 254 nm was measured using an agilent cary 60 uv vis spectrophotometer the specific uv absorbance suva254 was calculated by dividing this value by the doc chloride bromide and iodide were measured using a dionex dx 500 ion chromatograph dbps were measured by gas chromatography mass spectrometry as reported previously zeng and mitch 2016 briefly epa method 521 was used to measure 8 n nitrosamines in duplicate with 2 3 ng l method reporting limits mrls epa method 551 was used to measure volatile halogenated dbps in triplicate with 0 2 μg l mrls in addition to the 4 regulated thms this method analyzed unregulated dbps including 6 iodinated trihalomethanes 4 haloacetonitriles 4 haloacetamides 4 haloacetaldehydes 2 haloketones and chloropicrin epa method 552 was used to measure 10 haloacetic acids 9 brominated and chlorinated species and iodoacetic acid in triplicate with 0 2 μg l mrls individual dbps and their acronyms are provided in table s1 2 4 toxicity calculations the contribution of a dbp to the toxicity of a disinfected water is a function of both its concentration and its toxic potency measured dbp concentrations were weighted by metrics of toxic potency to evaluate their potential contributions to the dbp associated toxicity of the disinfected wastewaters tables s2 and s3 for most of the halogenated dbps the chronic mammalian cytotoxicity lc50 values the lowest concentration of each dbp associated with a 50 decrease in the growth of chinese hamster ovary cho cells compared to controls were developed by the same research group wagner and plewa 2017 reducing the uncertainty associated with cross laboratory comparisons cytotoxicity is a sensitive metric because the reduction in growth captures the cumulative effects of multiple modes of toxic action for nitrosamines and several of the thm4 and haa5 cancer potencies available from the us environmental protection agency s integrated risk information system iris database us epa 2018 were used to calculate a drinking water concentration associated with a 50 lifetime excess cancer risk lecr50 such that the lc50 and lecr50 values are on a common 50 risk level for the few compounds for which both lc50 and lecr50 values were available the more conservative values i e those that would indicate a greater contribution to calculated toxicity were selected while this procedure mixes toxicity endpoints it maximizes the potential contribution of these dbps of current regulatory interest which is important given that the results suggest a greater contribution from unregulated dbp classes see below measured dbp concentrations were divided by the selected lc50 or lecr50 values to provide unitless ratios theoretically reflecting how close a measured concentration of an individual dbp is to the concentration associated with 50 risk however dbps occur within complex mixtures and it is unclear whether the toxicity of these dbps are additive or whether they interact in a synergistic or antagonistic fashion additional research applying toxicological assays to dbp mixtures is needed to clarify these issues accordingly the toxicity weighting calculations were not employed to suggest an absolute risk level attributable to the dbps in these waters instead assuming that the toxicity of these dbps is additive these calculations were used as an initial indication of which dbps may contribute the most to dbp associated toxicity of disinfected waters the sums of these toxicity weighted dbp concentrations were compared across waters to provide an initial estimate of their relative cumulative toxicity this approach follows similar evaluations of the relative contributions of halogenated dbps and nitrosamines to the dbp associated toxicity of disinfected brackish groundwaters szczuka et al 2017 and municipal wastewater effluents purified using full advanced treatment fat trains zeng et al 2016b or ozonation and biological activated carbon chuang and mitch 2017 3 results 3 1 basic water quality and free chlorine ct over the course of the experiments february through june 2017 the ph and temperature ranged from 7 1 8 3 and 21 27 c respectively table s4 provides other basic water quality parameters for each of the dbp sampling rounds briefly the doc and uv absorbance at 254 nm ranged from 8 6 9 0 mg l and 0 15 0 16 cm 1 respectively such that the specific uv absorbance at 254 nm suva254 ranged from 1 6 1 9 l mg 1 m 1 during the first sampling day for dbps the bromide and iodide concentrations were 280 μg l and 27 μg l respectively and 165 μg l and 22 μg l on the second sampling day when free chlorine was injected to the filtered fully nitrified effluent the free chlorine residual declined by roughly 1 mg l as cl2 between the injection point and the end of the 3 inch pipe e g 4 mg l as cl2 to 3 mg l as cl2 representing a 2 8 min modal contact time the free chlorine ct calculated by multiplying the measured residual by the modal contact time increased with modal contact time as expected for samples collected along the 3 inch pipe section for ms2 inactivation testing samples were collected only along the 3 inch pipe section such that the free chlorine ct generally was less than or equal to 10 mg min l for dbp testing samples were collected at the end of the 3 inch pipe section to the end of the 10 inch pipe section representing modal contact times from 2 8 35 5 min for these tests the free chlorine residual declined from 3 5 3 9 mg l as cl2 to 0 3 0 8 mg l as cl2 between the 2 8 min and 35 5 min modal contact times the free chlorine ct did not increase consistently with increasing modal contact time due to the significant decline in the free chlorine residual as the modal contact time increased accordingly free chlorine exposures were calculated by summing the ct values determined between each modal contact time these exposures increase with modal contact time in the expected fashion the calculated free chlorine ct and exposure values were similar with and without spiking the influent with 1 mg l as n ammonia during the dbp testing table s5 provides the free chlorine residuals the cts and the exposures for all of the dbp sampling rounds the dbp results will be referenced with respect to the free chlorine exposure associated with the different sample ports because the free chlorine exposure not the ct is the primary driver of dbp formation total chlorine residual measurements were 1 3 0 4 standard deviation mg l as cl2 greater than the free chlorine residual measurements taken concurrently likely reflecting contributions from organic chloramines 3 2 inactivation of pathogen surrogates currently there are no specific regulatory goals for levels of pathogen inactivation to achieve upstream of the advanced treatment trains for potable reuse around which to select disinfectant exposures however in california there are overall inactivation goals to achieve throughout the treatment train for both potable and non potable applications cadph 2014a ddw 2017 existing regulations for groundwater recharge and surface water augmentation require a minimum of 12 10 and 10 log reduction in the concentrations of enteric virus giardia cysts and cryptosporidium oocysts these targets can be achieved through multiple locations in the overall treatment system including the wastewater treatment plant the advanced water treatment facility the aquifer in groundwater recharge and the drinking water treatment facility in surface water augmentation in california s title 22 regulations for non potable reuse unrestricted use e g golf course irrigation requires treatment with both tertiary filtration and disinfection the process must be capable of providing 5 log 99 999 reduction of poliovirus or the bacteriophage ms2 and maintain a 7 day median total coliform concentration 2 2 mpn 100 ml cadph 2014b non potable reuse trains typically apply chlorine or chloramines to tertiary filtered municipal wastewater effluents a situation similar to that examined here we used these pathogen inactivation goals for non potable reuse as a benchmark of what could be readily achieved upstream of advanced treatment trains for potable reuse fig 2 a provides the log inactivation of ms2 bacteriophage as a function of free chlorine ct the results were similar for unamended effluent control tests and effluent amended with either 0 8 1 5 mg l as n ammonia or 1 2 1 6 ntu of turbidity during amendment with ammonia ms2 inactivation was maintained because the chlorine dosing system increased the dose to exceed the breakpoint and achieve a free chlorine residual the 1 2 1 6 ntu of turbidity was within the 2 ntu range mandated in california for recycled tertiary filter effluents cadph 2014b whether ms2 inactivation would be maintained at significantly higher ntu would require further testing fig 2b presents the mean and 95 confidence interval for log removal of ms2 binned by cts of 2 mg min l combining the results for the control ammonia challenge and turbidity challenge tests the results indicate that free chlorine cts of 2 4 mg min l could reliably achieve the 5 log inactivation targeted by california s title 22 regulations for non potable reuse applying a 3 fold safety factor to the midpoint of this range 3 mg min l results in a future design target of a 10 mg min l free chlorine ct to ensure 5 log ms2 inactivation fig 3 presents the total coliform measurements characterized as either control free chlorine or sequential chlorination to distinguish the influent coliform levels and levels measured either after the 3 inch pipe exposed to only free chlorine or from ports along the 10 inch pipe which had been exposed to free chlorine and then chloramines due to ammonia injection upstream of the 10 inch pipe total coliform concentrations in the influent control generally were between 1000 10 000 mpn 100 ml fig 3 despite the presence of a few results that exceeded 2 2 mpn 100 ml sequential chlorine cts greater than 150 mg min l provided consistent compliance with the california title 22 requirement for non potable reuse and provided 3 log inactivation note that the 150 mg min l sequential chlorine ct includes 10 mg min l of free chlorine ct from the free chlorine contact within the 3 inch pipe prior to ammonia addition 3 3 tradeoffs in regulated dbp formation as a function of free chlorine exposure in identical experiments on two different days events 1 and 2 free chlorine was injected into the fully nitrified effluent 0 1 mg l as n ammonia upstream of the 3 inch pipe section at concentrations targeting 4 mg l as cl2 free chlorine residual at the end of the 3 inch pipe section samples were collected from sample ports representing free chlorine exposures ranging from approximately 10 to 40 mg min l and then treated with ammonia to form chloramines and held for 24 h prior to dbp analysis during the first sample event one set of samples was quenched upon collection to isolate dbp formation from the free chlorine exposure tables s6 and s7 provide concentrations of all of the individual dbp species during events 1 and 2 respectively the trends in dbp concentrations as a function of free chlorine exposure and their absolute concentrations were similar for the two sampling days ndma concentrations in the nitrified tertiary effluent entering the pilot chlorine contact basin were at or above the 10 ng l california notification level i e 10 ng l and 12 ng l for events 1 and 2 respectively during event 1 the ndma concentrations measured directly after free chlorine contact i e prior to chloramination remained at the levels measured in the influent regardless of the free chlorine exposure fig 4 a reflecting the fact that free chlorine generally does not form ndma shah and mitch 2012 ndma increased after 24 h of chloramination in all cases reflecting the presence of chloramine reactive ndma precursors in the wastewater effluent however ndma formation after chloramination declined with increasing free chlorine exposure from 36 ng l and 29 ng l at the lowest exposures 10 mg min l free chlorine exposure for events 1 and 2 respectively down to the background concentrations in the influent by 30 mg min l free chlorine exposure fig 4b and fig s1a these results concur with the demonstrated efficacy of free chlorine contact for deactivation of chloramine reactive ndma precursors in drinking waters shah et al 2012 the only other nitrosamine detected n nitrosomorpholine nmor remained near the 8 9 ng l levels measured in the influent in accordance with previous research indicating the lack of chloramine reactive nmor precursors in municipal wastewater zeng et al 2016a there were clear tradeoffs between reducing ndma formation and increasing the formation of regulated thm4 and haa5 with increasing free chlorine exposures low concentrations of thm4 2 μg l and haa5 3 μg l occurred in the wastewater prior to chlorination during both sample events thm4 and haa5 concentrations measured after 24 h of chloramination increased with free chlorine exposure fig 4b for event 1 and s1a for event 2 thm4 concentrations leveled out for exposures near 30 mg min l exceeding the 80 μg l mcl in event 1 or approaching it in event 2 haa5 concentrations began to level out at lower free chlorine exposures 20 mg min l but the maximum haa5 concentrations 35 40 μg l remained well below the 60 μg l mcl for event 1 samples analyzed directly after free chlorine exposure fig 4a cumulative haa5 concentrations were similar to those measured after 24 h of chloramination fig 4b however haa speciation shifted following chloramination with monohalogenated haas increasing and trihalogenated haas decreasing trihalogenated haas likely hydrolyzed during the 24 h chloramination while chloramines promote the formation of mono and dihalogenated haas diehl et al 2000 thm4 concentrations increased significantly during the chloramination particularly for the lower free chlorine exposures accordingly the 24 h chloramination contributed to an additional 21 μg l thm4 formation for the 10 9 mg min l free chlorine exposure but an additional 11 μg l thm4 for the 32 mg min l free chlorine exposure the lower thm4 formation during chloramination after the higher free chlorine exposure suggests that the higher free chlorine exposure had already partially depleted the thm4 precursors prior to the chloramination in addition to comparable absolute dbp concentrations the speciation of halogenated dbps was similar during both sample events for both sample events chloroform and bromodichloromethane each accounted for 35 40 of thm4 with dibromochloromethane constituting 20 and bromoform the remainder for thm4 measured directly after the 32 mg min l free chlorine exposure during event 1 the bromine substitution factor bsf i e the molar concentration of bromine in thm4 relative to the total bromine and chlorine in thm4 was 0 25 after the highest free chlorine exposures and 24 h of chloramination the bsf values were 0 27 and 0 24 for events 1 and 2 respectively haa9 concentrations were 9 20 μg l higher than haa5 concentrations driven by contributions from bromochloroacetic acid and bromodichloroacetic acid tables s6 and s7 when ammonia was added upstream of free chlorine injection to simulate an upset to the biological nitrification process i e the ammonia challenge condition the free chlorine dose was increased to exceed the breakpoint and achieve comparable free chlorine exposures to those observed in the fully nitrified effluent table s5 a kinetic model of the chloramine system has indicated that under these breakpoint conditions chlorination of ammonia will form chloramines that decay to release nitrogen gas and chloride over 30 min free chlorine coexists with inorganic dichloramine during this time period which is comparable to the modal contact times for free chlorine exposure in the pilot unit jafvert and valentine 1992 for the ammonia challenge condition the patterns of regulated dbp formation and the absolute thm4 concentrations were comparable to those observed in the fully nitrified effluent during both sample events fig 4c and fig s1b however haa5 and haa9 concentrations measured after 24 h of chloramination were higher for the ammonia challenge condition by an average of 6 6 μg l and 12 μg l respectively tables s6 and s7 despite the comparable free chlorine exposures inorganic dichloramine may be the more potent chloramine species towards the formation of haas and total organic halogen in chloraminated drinking waters diehl et al 2000 kinetic modeling has demonstrated that dichloramine and free chlorine coexist during breakpoint reactions jafvert and valentine 1992 and so dichloramine may have promoted haa formation like the fully nitrified effluent ndma formation after post chloramination in the ammonia challenge condition declined with increasing free chlorine exposures with concentrations reaching the levels in the influent at 30 mg min l free chlorine exposure however for shorter free chlorine exposures ndma formation after post chloramination was up to 19 ng l lower under the ammonia challenge condition even though the free chlorine exposures were comparable with and without ammonia addition the greater concentration of free chlorine injected to achieve breakpoint chlorination in the ammonia challenge condition likely led to a greater percentage of organic ndma precursors that were deactivated by free chlorine since these precursors compete with ammonia for reaction with free chlorine 3 4 total dbp formation as a function of free chlorine exposure unregulated haloacetonitriles haloacetamides haloacetaldehydes haloketones chloropicrin iodoacetic acid and iodinated thms were analyzed concurrently with thm4 and haas as a function of free chlorine exposure in all conditions total dbp formation after 24 h chloramination increased with free chlorine exposure during both sample events fig 5b and fig s2a total dbp formation leveled out at higher free chlorine exposures for event 1 the total dbp formation for the lowest 10 9 mg min l free chlorine exposure was roughly 70 of that for the highest 32 mg min l free chlorine exposure reflecting the importance of fast reacting precursors during event 1 for 10 9 mg min l free chlorine exposure approximately 50 of the total dbp formation after post chloramination was attributable to the free chlorine exposure but for 32 mg min l free chlorine exposure nearly all of the dbp formation was attributable to the free chlorine exposure fig 5 a and b the precursors for many dbps are the same whether the disinfectant is free chlorine or chloramines and so these results indicate that 32 mg min l free chlorine exposure was sufficient to nearly complete the conversion of precursors to dbps thm4 and haas accounted for 70 80 of the total mass of characterized dbps while the contribution of nitrosamines was negligible in accordance with previous research in drinking water krasner et al 2006 szczuka et al 2017 and wastewater zeng et al 2016b chuang and mitch 2017 high concentrations of some unregulated dbp classes were observed fig 5 for event 1 and fig s2 for event 2 particularly during event 1 total haloacetonitriles haloacetaldehydes and haloacetamides measured after 24 h of post chloramination reached 18 μg l 21 μg l and 7 μg l respectively for the 32 mg min l free chlorine exposure during event 1 fig 5b for these dbp classes the predominant species were dichloroacetonitrile bromodichloroacetaldehyde and bromochloroacetamide respectively during event 1 table s6 the formation of brominated species was lower during event 2 table s7 which featured a lower bromide concentration 165 μg l vs 280 μg l during event 1 table s4 post chloramination contributed 50 of the haloacetamides and 25 of the haloacetonitriles measured but decreased the concentrations of haloacetaldehydes these results agree with previous mechanistic research that found that post chloramination may divert some of the chlorinated intermediates formed from phenolic precursors towards the formation of haloacetamides and away from haloacetaldehyde formation chuang et al 2015 in addition chloramines can react with aldehydes to form nitriles joo and mitch 2007 shah and mitch 2012 of the six iodo thms measured only dichloroiodomethane bromochloroiodomethane and dibromoiodomethane were detected during event 1 and only dichloroiodomethane and bromochloroiodomethane during event 2 tables s6 and s7 dichloroiodomethane accounted for 70 of the total in all cases total iodo thm concentrations measured after post chloramination remained approximately constant as a function of free chlorine exposure with maximum concentrations of 14 5 μg l during event 1 and 5 5 μg l during event 2 fig 5b and fig s2a the higher concentrations measured during event 1 may reflect the higher iodide concentration i e 27 μg l vs 22 μg l table s4 however during event 1 the total iodinated thm formation measured directly after free chlorine contact increased with free chlorine exposure accounting for 23 and 67 of the total iodinated thm formation measured after post chloramination for the 10 9 mg min l and 32 mg min l free chlorine exposures respectively fig 5a and b this result is interesting given prior mechanistic research indicating that chloramines promote iodinated thm formation while chlorine rapidly oxidizes iodide to iodate bichsel and von gunten 2000 the increase was particularly evident for dichloroiodomethane which agrees with previous observations of dichloroiodomethane formation from chlorination of mildly saline drinking waters szczuka et al 2017 the only iodinated haa measured iodoacetic acid was not detected the patterns of formation and absolute concentrations of dbps measured after post chloramination as a function of free chlorine exposure were similar between the fully nitrified wastewater and the ammonia challenge tests fig 5 and fig s2 however haloacetonitrile concentrations were higher during the ammonia challenge tests by an average of 2 3 μg l for both events while haloacetaldehyde and haloacetamide concentrations were higher by 3 4 μg l and 3 8 μg l during event 2 the higher formation of these classes despite the similar free chlorine exposures may be due to coexistence of dichloramine with free chlorine during the first 0 5 h of breakpoint chlorination jafvert and valentine 1992 dichloramine was previously shown to contribute to the formation of haloacetonitriles haloacetaldehydes haloacetamides and haas diehl et al 2000 4 discussion future guidance and regulations for direct potable reuse dpr will likely require high levels of pathogen inactivation and the use of multiple treatment barriers nrc 2012 olivieri et al 2016 tchobanoglous et al 2015 sequential chlorine disinfection of tertiary municipal wastewater effluent upstream of the advanced treatment trains can serve as an additional treatment barrier while contributing to the overall log removal requirements for pathogen control a critical challenge for the design of these systems for dpr applications is to maximize pathogen inactivation while controlling the formation of dbps that may be difficult to remove in the advanced treatment train because pathogen inactivation goals for disinfection upstream of the advanced treatment trains have not been developed we used california s title 22 pathogen inactivation regulations for non potable reuse as benchmarks of inactivation levels that could be readily achieved prior to advanced treatment these criteria have practical implications for california where wastewater effluent is often destined for both non potable and potable reuse with a single disinfection process utilities could produce water that meets the non potable criteria while also providing pathogen credits for potable reuse the results indicate that for this effluent a 3 mg min l free chlorine exposure reliably achieved 5 log removal of ms2 bacteriophage fig 2 a combination of a 10 mg min l free chlorine exposure and 140 mg min l combined chlorine exposure i e 150 mg min l total chlorine exposure reliably reduced total coliform concentrations below 2 2 mpn 100 ml fig 3 nearly 3 log inactivation if free chlorine were dosed to achieve a 4 mg l as cl2 residual just prior to ammonia addition to form a chloramine residual the free chlorine and chloramine contact times would be approximately 2 5 min and 35 min respectively these contact times may be readily achievable within a treatment plant s chlorine contact basin in california for example chlorine contact basins for non potable reuse are sized to provide a 90 minute modal contact time utilities practicing dpr would also need to meet regulatory limits on dbps selecting a free chlorine exposure that balances the formation of regulated thm4 haa5 and nitrosamines may prove particularly challenging at the minimum free chlorine exposure needed to meet pathogen inactivation goals 10 mg min l and following 24 h of chloramine contact the formation of regulated thm4 and haa5 was well below the 80 μg l and 60 μg l mcls respectively fig 4 and fig s1 the majority of the thm and haa formation occurred within the free chlorine contact time as opposed to during 24 h chloramination fig 4 at 10 mg min l free chlorine exposure ndma still exceeded the 10 ng l ca notification level with 36 ng l and 29 ng l during events 1 and 2 respectively fig 4 and fig s1 although increasing the free chlorine exposure to 20 mg min l significantly reduced ndma formation an exposure near 30 mg min l was needed to eliminate ndma formation even then the background ndma concentrations in the filtered tertiary effluent were at the 10 ng l notification level however at 20 mg min l free chlorine exposure the thm4 formation approached or exceeded the 80 μg l mcl thus it may not be possible to select a free chlorine exposure to simultaneously meet pathogen inactivation goals and control of regulated thms haas and nitrosamines one option is to use the minimal free chlorine exposure that meets pathogen inactivation goals i e 10 mg min l to minimize the formation of regulated thm4 and haa5 and rely on the downstream advanced treatment train to control ndma concentrations within advanced treatment trains for potable reuse both ndma and thm4 are poorly removed by ro zeng et al 2016b however many advanced treatment trains employ high dose uv systems that effectively photolyze ndma gerrity et al 2013 zeng et al 2016b because these uv systems are less effective for removing thm4 and other unregulated halogenated dbps chuang et al 2016 it may be preferable to focus on pathogen inactivation and minimizing halogenated dbp formation rather than nitrosamine formation upstream of the advanced treatment train given the difficulty of selecting a free chlorine exposure that simultaneously meets all pathogen and dbp goals another option is to select a free chlorine exposure that meets pathogen inactivation goals while minimizing the overall formation of dbps including the unregulated classes the 10 mg min l free chlorine exposure required to meet pathogen inactivation goals also minimized the total formation of dbps on a mass basis including the unregulated halogenated classes fig 5 and fig s2 the contribution of an individual dbp to the toxicity of a disinfected water is a function of both its concentration and its toxic potency for example though ndma occurs at orders of magnitude lower concentrations than thms it exhibits higher toxic potency accordingly the measured concentrations of individual dbps were weighted by metrics of toxic potency tables s2 and s3 and then compared to the sum of these toxicity weighted dbp concentrations for different free chlorine exposures fig 6 figs s3 and s4 these calculations indicate that the minimum free chlorine exposure required for compliance with pathogen inactivation goals may also minimize the calculated dbp associated toxicity despite maximizing ndma formation interestingly the haloacetaldehydes hals haloacetonitriles hans and haloacetamides hams dominated the calculated dbp associated toxicity not the thm4 haa5 and nitrosamines of current regulatory interest with the exception of bromoacetic acid during event 2 fig s4 significant contributions of unregulated dbps to the calculated dbp associated toxicity of disinfected waters were previously observed in chlorine and chloramine disinfected brackish groundwaters szczuka et al 2017 potable reuse effluents treated by reverse osmosis and advanced oxidation zeng et al 2016b and potable reuse effluents treated by ozone and biological activated carbon chuang and mitch 2017 while these results can be used to suggest the potential importance of dbp classes additional research is needed to validate their contributions to the toxicity of disinfected wastewaters including the application of toxicity bioassays to complex mixtures associated with disinfected wastewaters the results herein were consistent over four sampling rounds conducted over two different days both with low levels of ammonia in the influent and with supplemented ammonia in the influent representative of the normal function and of upsets to the biological nitrification process respectively while there should be qualitative similarities between nitrified tertiary effluents from different facilities with respect to the tradeoffs between pathogen inactivation and formation of different dbp classes differences in absolute concentrations are expected for example the concentrations of ndma and chloramine reactive ndma precursors in the tertiary effluent vary widely in different sewersheds sedlak et al 2005 affecting the ndma concentrations that could be achieved with high free chlorine exposures pathogen surrogate inactivation and dbp formation have rarely been evaluated simultaneously li and mitch 2018 particularly with respect to wastewater disinfection for utilities interested in potable reuse this type of analysis will be needed to optimize disinfection systems upstream of advanced treatment trains for potable reuse 5 conclusions for direct potable reuse disinfection of fully nitrified filtered municipal wastewater effluents with free chlorine upstream of advanced treatment could be an option to obtain additional pathogen log inactivation credits thereafter ammonia could be added to form chloramines to inhibit biofilm growth on membranes within the advanced treatment train however the free chlorine ct must be optimized to balance the increase in pathogen inactivation and reduction in ndma formation against the increased formation of halogenated dbps this pilot study found that a 3 mg min l chlorine ct could reliably achieve 5 log inactivation of ms2 bacteriophage even in the presence of up to 1 6 ntu turbidity or when up to 1 5 mg l as n ammonia in the wastewater necessitated breakpoint chlorination to achieve a free chlorine residual a combination of 10 mg min l chlorine ct with 140 mg min l chloramine ct reduced total coliform concentrations below 2 2 mpn 100 ml a 30 mg min l free chlorine ct was needed to eliminate ndma formation during chloramination but this chlorine exposure increased the formation of thms and haas with thms approaching or exceeding the maximum contaminant level for thms the formation of unregulated halogenated dbp classes also increased with free chlorine ct because some of these classes particularly haloacetonitriles and haloacetaldehydes may be significant contributors to the dbp associated toxicity of the disinfected effluent selecting a free chlorine ct just above that required for pathogen inactivation may optimize the balance between pathogen inactivation and dbp formation acknowledgements this work was supported by funding from

19451,treatment of fully nitrified municipal wastewater effluents with chlorine followed by chloramines i e sequential chlorine disinfection upstream of advanced treatment trains can contribute pathogen inactivation credits for potable reuse while leaving a chloramine residual to control biofouling on membrane units in the advanced treatment train however free chlorine exposures must be optimized to maximize pathogen inactivation while minimizing the formation of disinfection byproducts dbps that are challenging to remove in the advanced treatment train using a pilot scale disinfection contactor receiving fully nitrified tertiary municipal wastewater effluent this study found that a 3 mg min l free chlorine ct i e the product of the chlorine residual c and the contact time t followed by a 140 mg min l chloramine ct could reliably achieve 5 log inactivation of ms2 bacteriophage and reduce median total coliform concentrations below 2 2 mpn 100 ml free chlorine disinfection was equally effective when chlorine was dosed to exceed the breakpoint for 1 mg l of ammonia as n at this free chlorine exposure regulated trihalomethane thm and haloacetic acid haa formation remained below their maximum contaminant levels mcls but ndma concentrations of 30 ng l were above the 10 ng l california notification level increasing the free chlorine exposure to 30 mg min l increased thm and haa formation with regulated thms approaching or exceeding the mcl although this free chlorine exposure prevented ndma formation during chloramination the 10 ng l background ndma formation in the tertiary effluent remained increasing the free chlorine exposure also increased the formation of unregulated halogenated dbp classes that may be significant contributors to the dbp associated toxicity of the disinfected wastewater the results indicate that sequential chlorination can be used to optimize the benefits of free chlorine virus and ndma control and chloramine disinfection thm haa and coliform control graphical abstract image 1 keywords sequential chlorination potable reuse virus coliform ndma halogenated dbps 1 introduction providing a safe water supply requires controlling exposure to both microbial pathogens and toxic chemicals nrc 2012 olivieri et al 2016 pecson et al 2015 tchobanoglous et al 2015 while high disinfectant doses can reduce the acute risk posed by pathogens they increase the chronic risk associated with the formation of potentially carcinogenic disinfection byproducts dbps balancing these risks is an important challenge for disinfection yet previous studies have infrequently characterized the tradeoffs between pathogen inactivation and dbp formation as a function of disinfectant exposure li and mitch 2018 given the high concentrations of both pathogens and dbp precursors in municipal sewage optimizing this balance is even more challenging for the potable reuse of wastewaters the high levels of pathogen inactivation required for indirect potable reuse ipr systems are typically achieved through a combination of multiple unit treatment processes and an environmental buffer e g an aquifer cadph 2014a ddw 2017 twdb 2015 across the country there is growing interest in the expanded implementation of direct potable reuse dpr where advanced treatment train effluents are routed directly to drinking water systems without passing through environmental buffers gerrity et al 2013 in these scenarios however the pathogen inactivation credits associated with the environmental buffers must then be supplied elsewhere in the treatment train while attention has focused on pathogen inactivation within the advanced treatment trains disinfection of the wastewater influents to these trains could also contribute to the pathogen inactivation credits at many current ipr advanced water treatment facilities awtf the chloramines applied to the advanced treatment train influents to control biofilm growth on microfiltration mf and reverse osmosis ro membranes may be the first disinfectant exposure for the wastewater however the pathogen inactivation achieved by these chloramines is minimal given the low disinfectant potency of chloramines and the short exposure time minutes because many of these facilities receive nitrified municipal wastewater effluents an alternative is to apply a short free chlorine exposure followed by ammonia addition to form chloramines i e sequential chlorination upstream of the mf and ro membranes in the advanced treatment train huitric et al 2014 maguin et al 2009 free chlorine exposure would enhance the inactivation of pathogens particularly viruses sobsey et al 1988 shin and sobsey 1998 cromeans et al 2010 chloramination would promote coliform inactivation berman et al 1988 while the residual chloramines would control biofouling on mf and ro membranes however the free chlorine exposure should be optimized to balance pathogen inactivation against the formation of dbps the national research council indicated that dbps are important contaminants of concern for potable reuse with concentrations in reuse effluents far closer to levels of potential human health concern than pharmaceuticals nrc 2012 utilities practicing potable reuse must meet existing drinking water regulatory limits on dbps these limits include the 80 μg l maximum contaminant level mcl for four trihalomethanes thm4 chloroform bromodichloromethane dibromochloromethane and bromoform and the 60 μg l mcl for five haloacetic acids haa5 chloroacetic acid bromoacetic acid

treatment trains are typically designed to remove ndma gerrity et al 2013 however ro and aop systems are only partially successful at removing low molecular weight uncharged halogenated dbps e g thms zeng et al 2016b dbp formation within dpr treatment trains is likely to be even more important than in ipr treatment trains due to the lack of dbp removal within environmental buffers thus optimization of the free chlorine exposure is needed to maximize pathogen inactivation while avoiding excessive formation of dbps that are challenging to remove within the subsequent advanced treatment train the first objective of this study was to characterize the efficacy of sequential chlorination for inactivation of pathogen surrogates during pilot scale treatment of a fully nitrified filtered tertiary municipal wastewater effluent the second objective was to characterize the tradeoffs between pathogen surrogate inactivation and dbp formation as a function of free chlorine exposure during sequential chlorination for wastewater reuse the third objective was to characterize the tradeoffs between the formation of different dbp classes although oxidants other than free chlorine could achieve pathogen inactivation and control specific dbp classes shah et al 2012 this study focused on free chlorine because it can be applied to nitrified wastewater effluents without the addition of other process units previous research with drinking water demonstrated that increasing the free chlorine exposure can reduce ndma formation during subsequent chloramination by deactivating ndma precursors charrois and hrudey 2007 shah et al 2012 however increasing the free chlorine exposure increases the formation of halogenated dbps such as thm4 and haa5 shah et al 2012 this study evaluated these tradeoffs in nitrified municipal wastewater for regulated dbps and for several unregulated halogenated dbp classes including iodinated thms haloacetonitriles haloacetamides haloacetaldehydes and haloketones toxicological assays have indicated that these classes can exhibit significantly higher cytotoxicity and genotoxicity than the constituents of thm4 and haa5 wagner and plewa 2017 for all three objectives this study also evaluated the effect of an upset to the biological nitrification process by raising the pilot unit influent ammonia concentration from 0 1 mg l as n to 1 mg l as n the ammonia challenge condition under these conditions this study evaluated the effects on pathogen surrogate inactivation and dbp formation of increasing the free chlorine dose to exceed the breakpoint and leave the same target free chlorine residual 2 materials and methods 2 1 pilot system the pilot scale disinfection system consisted of one 3 inch diameter 80 foot long pvc pipe section and one 10 inch diameter 80 foot long pvc pipe section each with 10 equally spaced sample ports fig 1 a nitrified filtered municipal wastewater effluent that had not been previously exposed to disinfectants served as the influent to the pilot unit two reagent injection ports were located upstream of each pipe section each followed by a static mixer at the 10 gpm influent flowrate

pumps fed reagents from two different storage tanks through the injection ports the reagents included the treatment facility s 12 5 by weight sodium hypochlorite stock solution diluted 3 fold with tap water to facilitate dosing control and a 22 5 by weight ammonium sulfate solution in tap water a third storage tank was used to mix the ms2 bacteriophage stock solution with influent tertiary

9 1 5 mg l as n ammonia and 3 filter effluent amended with particulates to increase the turbidity two sampling days with 1 2 1 6 ntu turbidity the challenge tests with ammonia and turbidity were designed to represent worst case conditions with regard to both of these parameters during ammonia challenge tests the free chlorine dose was increased to exceed the breakpoint and maintain the target free chlorine residual at the end of the 3 inch pipe during turbidity challenge tests backwash water from a tertiary media filter was added to the 1000 gallon tank to achieve given ntu target levels in addition to particulates this backwash likely contained some additional dissolved organic matter following ms2 seeding and any turbidity addition the 1000 gallon tank was pump mixed for at least three hydraulic residence times to ensure adequate mixing and time for interactions between ms2 and waterborne particulates the pilot disinfection system was fed from the 1000 gallon tank at a flowrate of 10 gpm over the 4 days of testing 210 ms2 samples were collected at various sample points along the 3 inch pvc pipe section and measured for free chlorine residual and infective ms2 concentrations virus samples were collected in sterile tubes containing an excess of sodium thiosulfate to quench residual disinfectant infective ms2 concentrations were determined using the double layer agar method a modification of u s epa method 1602 adams 1959 in the trussell tech laboratory in pasadena ca native total coliform samples were collected four times per week from february 13 through june 15 2017 from four locations along the pipeline contactor 1 prior to chlorine injection 2 after the 3 inch section 3 half way through the 10 inch section and 4 at the end of the 10 inch section total coliform was measured using standard method 9223 note that ammonia was added after the 3 inch section to convert the free chlorine into a chloramine residual chloramines were maintained throughout the 10 inch section allowing for quantification of the total coliform inactivation through the sequential process 2 3 dbp formation experiments dbp experiments were conducted separately from the ms2 experiments because the ms2 stock was stored in an organic rich growth medium that might impact dbp concentrations compared to the unamended wastewater effluent dbp experiments were fully repeated on two different days on each day a series of samples representing different free chlorine exposures were collected with 1 unamended fully nitrified effluent 0 1 mg l as n ammonia and 2 effluent amended with 1 0 mg l as n ammonia i e ammonia challenge tests during ammonia challenge tests the free chlorine dose was increased to exceed the breakpoint and maintain a defined free chlorine residual background levels of dbps and other water quality parameters were measured in samples collected from a sample port upstream of the 3 inch pipe section experimental samples were collected from the last sample port on the 3 inch pipe and three sample ports on the 10 inch pipe representing 2 8 8 3 22 1 and 35 5 min of modal contact time respectively during these experiments ammonia was not injected between the 3 inch and 10 inch pipes in order to maintain a free chlorine residual throughout the system the free chlorine residual was measured at each sample port prior to and after sample collection the average of these values was multiplied by the modal contact time corresponding to each port to calculate the free chlorine exposure for most experiments involving free chlorine contact sample bottles used to collect dbp samples contained ammonium chloride at a 1 2 chlorine to ammonia molar ratio to convert the free chlorine to chloramines these samples were transported at ambient temperature back to the laboratory at stanford and held at 20 c for 24 h before quenching the chloramine residual with 33 mg l ascorbic acid and analysis these samples were meant to simulate conditions of a recycled water that 1 had been treated with an initial free chlorine exposure 2 had been converted to chloramine through ammonia addition and 3 had traveled within a distribution system with a chloramine residual for a 24 h period during the first sampling event for effluent without ammonia addition another set of samples was collected in bottles prepared with 33 mg l ascorbic acid to isolate the dbp formation resulting from free chlorine exposure alone these samples were transported on ice to the laboratory and stored at 4 c before analysis dissolved organic carbon doc was measured with a shimadzu toc vcsh total organic carbon analyzer uv absorbance at 254 nm was measured using an agilent cary 60 uv vis spectrophotometer the specific uv absorbance suva254 was calculated by dividing this value by the doc chloride bromide and iodide were measured using a dionex dx 500 ion chromatograph dbps were measured by gas chromatography mass spectrometry as reported previously zeng and mitch 2016 briefly epa method 521 was used to measure 8 n nitrosamines in duplicate with 2 3 ng l method reporting limits mrls epa method 551 was used to measure volatile halogenated dbps in triplicate with 0 2 μg l mrls in addition to the 4 regulated thms this method analyzed unregulated dbps including 6 iodinated trihalomethanes 4 haloacetonitriles 4 haloacetamides 4 haloacetaldehydes 2 haloketones and chloropicrin epa method 552 was used to measure 10 haloacetic acids 9 brominated and chlorinated species and iodoacetic acid in triplicate with 0 2 μg l mrls individual dbps and their acronyms are provided in table s1 2 4 toxicity calculations the contribution of a dbp to the toxicity of a disinfected water is a function of both its concentration and its toxic potency measured dbp concentrations were weighted by metrics of toxic potency to evaluate their potential contributions to the dbp associated toxicity of the disinfected wastewaters tables s2 and s3 for most of the halogenated dbps the chronic mammalian cytotoxicity lc50 values the lowest concentration of each dbp associated with a 50 decrease in the growth of chinese hamster ovary cho cells compared to controls were developed by the same research group wagner and plewa 2017 reducing the uncertainty associated with cross laboratory comparisons cytotoxicity is a sensitive metric because the reduction in growth captures the cumulative effects of multiple modes of toxic action for nitrosamines and several of the thm4 and haa5 cancer potencies available from the us environmental protection agency s integrated risk information system iris database us epa 2018 were used to calculate a drinking water concentration associated with a 50 lifetime excess cancer risk lecr50 such that the lc50 and lecr50 values are on a common 50 risk level for the few compounds for which both lc50 and lecr50 values were available the more conservative values i e those that would indicate a greater contribution to calculated toxicity were selected while this procedure mixes toxicity endpoints it maximizes the potential contribution of these dbps of current regulatory interest which is important given that the results suggest a greater contribution from unregulated dbp classes see below measured dbp concentrations were divided by the selected lc50 or lecr50 values to provide unitless ratios theoretically reflecting how close a measured concentration of an individual dbp is to the concentration associated with 50 risk however dbps occur within complex mixtures and it is unclear whether the toxicity of these dbps are additive or whether they interact in a synergistic or antagonistic fashion additional research applying toxicological assays to dbp mixtures is needed to clarify these issues accordingly the toxicity weighting calculations were not employed to suggest an absolute risk level attributable to the dbps in these waters instead assuming that the toxicity of these dbps is additive these calculations were used as an initial indication of which dbps may contribute the most to dbp associated toxicity of disinfected waters the sums of these toxicity weighted dbp concentrations were compared across waters to provide an initial estimate of their relative cumulative toxicity this approach follows similar evaluations of the relative contributions of halogenated dbps and nitrosamines to the dbp associated toxicity of disinfected brackish groundwaters szczuka et al 2017 and municipal wastewater effluents purified using full advanced treatment fat trains zeng et al 2016b or ozonation and biological activated carbon chuang and mitch 2017 3 results 3 1 basic water quality and free chlorine ct over the course of the experiments february through june 2017 the ph and temperature ranged from 7 1 8 3 and 21 27 c respectively table s4 provides other basic water quality parameters for each of the dbp sampling rounds briefly the doc and uv absorbance at 254 nm ranged from 8 6 9 0 mg l and 0 15 0 16 cm 1 respectively such that the specific uv absorbance at 254 nm suva254 ranged from 1 6 1 9 l mg 1 m 1 during the first sampling day for dbps the bromide and iodide concentrations were 280 μg l and 27 μg l respectively and 165 μg l and 22 μg l on the second sampling day when free chlorine was injected to the filtered fully nitrified effluent the free chlorine residual declined by roughly 1 mg l as cl2 between the injection point and the end of the 3 inch pipe e g 4 mg l as cl2 to 3 mg l as cl2 representing a 2 8 min modal contact time the free chlorine ct calculated by multiplying the measured residual by the modal contact time increased with modal contact time as expected for samples collected along the 3 inch pipe section for ms2 inactivation testing samples were collected only along the 3 inch pipe section such that the free chlorine ct generally was less than or equal to 10 mg min l for dbp testing samples were collected at the end of the 3 inch pipe section to the end of the 10 inch pipe section representing modal contact times from 2 8 35 5 min for these tests the free chlorine residual declined from 3 5 3 9 mg l as cl2 to 0 3 0 8 mg l as cl2 between the 2 8 min and 35 5 min modal contact times the free chlorine ct did not increase consistently with increasing modal contact time due to the significant decline in the free chlorine residual as the modal contact time increased accordingly free chlorine exposures were calculated by summing the ct values determined between each modal contact time these exposures increase with modal contact time in the expected fashion the calculated free chlorine ct and exposure values were similar with and without spiking the influent with 1 mg l as n ammonia during the dbp testing table s5 provides the free chlorine residuals the cts and the exposures for all of the dbp sampling rounds the dbp results will be referenced with respect to the free chlorine exposure associated with the different sample ports because the free chlorine exposure not the ct is the primary driver of dbp formation total chlorine residual measurements were 1 3 0 4 standard deviation mg l as cl2 greater than the free chlorine residual measurements taken concurrently likely reflecting contributions from organic chloramines 3 2 inactivation of pathogen surrogates currently there are no specific regulatory goals for levels of pathogen inactivation to achieve upstream of the advanced treatment trains for potable reuse around which to select disinfectant exposures however in california there are overall inactivation goals to achieve throughout the treatment train for both potable and non potable applications cadph 2014a ddw 2017 existing regulations for groundwater recharge and surface water augmentation require a minimum of 12 10 and 10 log reduction in the concentrations of enteric virus giardia cysts and cryptosporidium oocysts these targets can be achieved through multiple locations in the overall treatment system including the wastewater treatment plant the advanced water treatment facility the aquifer in groundwater recharge and the drinking water treatment facility in surface water augmentation in california s title 22 regulations for non potable reuse unrestricted use e g golf course irrigation requires treatment with both tertiary filtration and disinfection the process must be capable of providing 5 log 99 999 reduction of poliovirus or the bacteriophage ms2 and maintain a 7 day median total coliform concentration 2 2 mpn 100 ml cadph 2014b non potable reuse trains typically apply chlorine or chloramines to tertiary filtered municipal wastewater effluents a situation similar to that examined here we used these pathogen inactivation goals for non potable reuse as a benchmark of what could be readily achieved upstream of advanced treatment trains for potable reuse fig 2 a provides the log inactivation of ms2 bacteriophage as a function of free chlorine ct the results were similar for unamended effluent control tests and effluent amended with either 0 8 1 5 mg l as n ammonia or 1 2 1 6 ntu of turbidity during amendment with ammonia ms2 inactivation was maintained because the chlorine dosing system increased the dose to exceed the breakpoint and achieve a free chlorine residual the 1 2 1 6 ntu of turbidity was within the 2 ntu range mandated in california for recycled tertiary filter effluents cadph 2014b whether ms2 inactivation would be maintained at significantly higher ntu would require further testing fig 2b presents the mean and 95 confidence interval for log removal of ms2 binned by cts of 2 mg min l combining the results for the control ammonia challenge and turbidity challenge tests the results indicate that free chlorine cts of 2 4 mg min l could reliably achieve the 5 log inactivation targeted by california s title 22 regulations for non potable reuse applying a 3 fold safety factor to the midpoint of this range 3 mg min l results in a future design target of a 10 mg min l free chlorine ct to ensure 5 log ms2 inactivation fig 3 presents the total coliform measurements characterized as either control free chlorine or sequential chlorination to distinguish the influent coliform levels and levels measured either after the 3 inch pipe exposed to only free chlorine or from ports along the 10 inch pipe which had been exposed to free chlorine and then chloramines due to ammonia injection upstream of the 10 inch pipe total coliform concentrations in the influent control generally were between 1000 10 000 mpn 100 ml fig 3 despite the presence of a few results that exceeded 2 2 mpn 100 ml sequential chlorine cts greater than 150 mg min l provided consistent compliance with the california title 22 requirement for non potable reuse and provided 3 log inactivation note that the 150 mg min l sequential chlorine ct includes 10 mg min l of free chlorine ct from the free chlorine contact within the 3 inch pipe prior to ammonia addition 3 3 tradeoffs in regulated dbp formation as a function of free chlorine exposure in identical experiments on two different days events 1 and 2 free chlorine was injected into the fully nitrified effluent 0 1 mg l as n ammonia upstream of the 3 inch pipe section at concentrations targeting 4 mg l as cl2 free chlorine residual at the end of the 3 inch pipe section samples were collected from sample ports representing free chlorine exposures ranging from approximately 10 to 40 mg min l and then treated with ammonia to form chloramines and held for 24 h prior to dbp analysis during the first sample event one set of samples was quenched upon collection to isolate dbp formation from the free chlorine exposure tables s6 and s7 provide concentrations of all of the individual dbp species during events 1 and 2 respectively the trends in dbp concentrations as a function of free chlorine exposure and their absolute concentrations were similar for the two sampling days ndma concentrations in the nitrified tertiary effluent entering the pilot chlorine contact basin were at or above the 10 ng l california notification level i e 10 ng l and 12 ng l for events 1 and 2 respectively during event 1 the ndma concentrations measured directly after free chlorine contact i e prior to chloramination remained at the levels measured in the influent regardless of the free chlorine exposure fig 4 a reflecting the fact that free chlorine generally does not form ndma shah and mitch 2012 ndma increased after 24 h of chloramination in all cases reflecting the presence of chloramine reactive ndma precursors in the wastewater effluent however ndma formation after chloramination declined with increasing free chlorine exposure from 36 ng l and 29 ng l at the lowest exposures 10 mg min l free chlorine exposure for events 1 and 2 respectively down to the background concentrations in the influent by 30 mg min l free chlorine exposure fig 4b and fig s1a these results concur with the demonstrated efficacy of free chlorine contact for deactivation of chloramine reactive ndma precursors in drinking waters shah et al 2012 the only other nitrosamine detected n nitrosomorpholine nmor remained near the 8 9 ng l levels measured in the influent in accordance with previous research indicating the lack of chloramine reactive nmor precursors in municipal wastewater zeng et al 2016a there were clear tradeoffs between reducing ndma formation and increasing the formation of regulated thm4 and haa5 with increasing free chlorine exposures low concentrations of thm4 2 μg l and haa5 3 μg l occurred in the wastewater prior to chlorination during both sample events thm4 and haa5 concentrations measured after 24 h of chloramination increased with free chlorine exposure fig 4b for event 1 and s1a for event 2 thm4 concentrations leveled out for exposures near 30 mg min l exceeding the 80 μg l mcl in event 1 or approaching it in event 2 haa5 concentrations began to level out at lower free chlorine exposures 20 mg min l but the maximum haa5 concentrations 35 40 μg l remained well below the 60 μg l mcl for event 1 samples analyzed directly after free chlorine exposure fig 4a cumulative haa5 concentrations were similar to those measured after 24 h of chloramination fig 4b however haa speciation shifted following chloramination with monohalogenated haas increasing and trihalogenated haas decreasing trihalogenated haas likely hydrolyzed during the 24 h chloramination while chloramines promote the formation of mono and dihalogenated haas diehl et al 2000 thm4 concentrations increased significantly during the chloramination particularly for the lower free chlorine exposures accordingly the 24 h chloramination contributed to an additional 21 μg l thm4 formation for the 10 9 mg min l free chlorine exposure but an additional 11 μg l thm4 for the 32 mg min l free chlorine exposure the lower thm4 formation during chloramination after the higher free chlorine exposure suggests that the higher free chlorine exposure had already partially depleted the thm4 precursors prior to the chloramination in addition to comparable absolute dbp concentrations the speciation of halogenated dbps was similar during both sample events for both sample events chloroform and bromodichloromethane each accounted for 35 40 of thm4 with dibromochloromethane constituting 20 and bromoform the remainder for thm4 measured directly after the 32 mg min l free chlorine exposure during event 1 the bromine substitution factor bsf i e the molar concentration of bromine in thm4 relative to the total bromine and chlorine in thm4 was 0 25 after the highest free chlorine exposures and 24 h of chloramination the bsf values were 0 27 and 0 24 for events 1 and 2 respectively haa9 concentrations were 9 20 μg l higher than haa5 concentrations driven by contributions from bromochloroacetic acid and bromodichloroacetic acid tables s6 and s7 when ammonia was added upstream of free chlorine injection to simulate an upset to the biological nitrification process i e the ammonia challenge condition the free chlorine dose was increased to exceed the breakpoint and achieve comparable free chlorine exposures to those observed in the fully nitrified effluent table s5 a kinetic model of the chloramine system has indicated that under these breakpoint conditions chlorination of ammonia will form chloramines that decay to release nitrogen gas and chloride over 30 min free chlorine coexists with inorganic dichloramine during this time period which is comparable to the modal contact times for free chlorine exposure in the pilot unit jafvert and valentine 1992 for the ammonia challenge condition the patterns of regulated dbp formation and the absolute thm4 concentrations were comparable to those observed in the fully nitrified effluent during both sample events fig 4c and fig s1b however haa5 and haa9 concentrations measured after 24 h of chloramination were higher for the ammonia challenge condition by an average of 6 6 μg l and 12 μg l respectively tables s6 and s7 despite the comparable free chlorine exposures inorganic dichloramine may be the more potent chloramine species towards the formation of haas and total organic halogen in chloraminated drinking waters diehl et al 2000 kinetic modeling has demonstrated that dichloramine and free chlorine coexist during breakpoint reactions jafvert and valentine 1992 and so dichloramine may have promoted haa formation like the fully nitrified effluent ndma formation after post chloramination in the ammonia challenge condition declined with increasing free chlorine exposures with concentrations reaching the levels in the influent at 30 mg min l free chlorine exposure however for shorter free chlorine exposures ndma formation after post chloramination was up to 19 ng l lower under the ammonia challenge condition even though the free chlorine exposures were comparable with and without ammonia addition the greater concentration of free chlorine injected to achieve breakpoint chlorination in the ammonia challenge condition likely led to a greater percentage of organic ndma precursors that were deactivated by free chlorine since these precursors compete with ammonia for reaction with free chlorine 3 4 total dbp formation as a function of free chlorine exposure unregulated haloacetonitriles haloacetamides haloacetaldehydes haloketones chloropicrin iodoacetic acid and iodinated thms were analyzed concurrently with thm4 and haas as a function of free chlorine exposure in all conditions total dbp formation after 24 h chloramination increased with free chlorine exposure during both sample events fig 5b and fig s2a total dbp formation leveled out at higher free chlorine exposures for event 1 the total dbp formation for the lowest 10 9 mg min l free chlorine exposure was roughly 70 of that for the highest 32 mg min l free chlorine exposure reflecting the importance of fast reacting precursors during event 1 for 10 9 mg min l free chlorine exposure approximately 50 of the total dbp formation after post chloramination was attributable to the free chlorine exposure but for 32 mg min l free chlorine exposure nearly all of the dbp formation was attributable to the free chlorine exposure fig 5 a and b the precursors for many dbps are the same whether the disinfectant is free chlorine or chloramines and so these results indicate that 32 mg min l free chlorine exposure was sufficient to nearly complete the conversion of precursors to dbps thm4 and haas accounted for 70 80 of the total mass of characterized dbps while the contribution of nitrosamines was negligible in accordance with previous research in drinking water krasner et al 2006 szczuka et al 2017 and wastewater zeng et al 2016b chuang and mitch 2017 high concentrations of some unregulated dbp classes were observed fig 5 for event 1 and fig s2 for event 2 particularly during event 1 total haloacetonitriles haloacetaldehydes and haloacetamides measured after 24 h of post chloramination reached 18 μg l 21 μg l and 7 μg l respectively for the 32 mg min l free chlorine exposure during event 1 fig 5b for these dbp classes the predominant species were dichloroacetonitrile bromodichloroacetaldehyde and bromochloroacetamide respectively during event 1 table s6 the formation of brominated species was lower during event 2 table s7 which featured a lower bromide concentration 165 μg l vs 280 μg l during event 1 table s4 post chloramination contributed 50 of the haloacetamides and 25 of the haloacetonitriles measured but decreased the concentrations of haloacetaldehydes these results agree with previous mechanistic research that found that post chloramination may divert some of the chlorinated intermediates formed from phenolic precursors towards the formation of haloacetamides and away from haloacetaldehyde formation chuang et al 2015 in addition chloramines can react with aldehydes to form nitriles joo and mitch 2007 shah and mitch 2012 of the six iodo thms measured only dichloroiodomethane bromochloroiodomethane and dibromoiodomethane were detected during event 1 and only dichloroiodomethane and bromochloroiodomethane during event 2 tables s6 and s7 dichloroiodomethane accounted for 70 of the total in all cases total iodo thm concentrations measured after post chloramination remained approximately constant as a function of free chlorine exposure with maximum concentrations of 14 5 μg l during event 1 and 5 5 μg l during event 2 fig 5b and fig s2a the higher concentrations measured during event 1 may reflect the higher iodide concentration i e 27 μg l vs 22 μg l table s4 however during event 1 the total iodinated thm formation measured directly after free chlorine contact increased with free chlorine exposure accounting for 23 and 67 of the total iodinated thm formation measured after post chloramination for the 10 9 mg min l and 32 mg min l free chlorine exposures respectively fig 5a and b this result is interesting given prior mechanistic research indicating that chloramines promote iodinated thm formation while chlorine rapidly oxidizes iodide to iodate bichsel and von gunten 2000 the increase was particularly evident for dichloroiodomethane which agrees with previous observations of dichloroiodomethane formation from chlorination of mildly saline drinking waters szczuka et al 2017 the only iodinated haa measured iodoacetic acid was not detected the patterns of formation and absolute concentrations of dbps measured after post chloramination as a function of free chlorine exposure were similar between the fully nitrified wastewater and the ammonia challenge tests fig 5 and fig s2 however haloacetonitrile concentrations were higher during the ammonia challenge tests by an average of 2 3 μg l for both events while haloacetaldehyde and haloacetamide concentrations were higher by 3 4 μg l and 3 8 μg l during event 2 the higher formation of these classes despite the similar free chlorine exposures may be due to coexistence of dichloramine with free chlorine during the first 0 5 h of breakpoint chlorination jafvert and valentine 1992 dichloramine was previously shown to contribute to the formation of haloacetonitriles haloacetaldehydes haloacetamides and haas diehl et al 2000 4 discussion future guidance and regulations for direct potable reuse dpr will likely require high levels of pathogen inactivation and the use of multiple treatment barriers nrc 2012 olivieri et al 2016 tchobanoglous et al 2015 sequential chlorine disinfection of tertiary municipal wastewater effluent upstream of the advanced treatment trains can serve as an additional treatment barrier while contributing to the overall log removal requirements for pathogen control a critical challenge for the design of these systems for dpr applications is to maximize pathogen inactivation while controlling the formation of dbps that may be difficult to remove in the advanced treatment train because pathogen inactivation goals for disinfection upstream of the advanced treatment trains have not been developed we used california s title 22 pathogen inactivation regulations for non potable reuse as benchmarks of inactivation levels that could be readily achieved prior to advanced treatment these criteria have practical implications for california where wastewater effluent is often destined for both non potable and potable reuse with a single disinfection process utilities could produce water that meets the non potable criteria while also providing pathogen credits for potable reuse the results indicate that for this effluent a 3 mg min l free chlorine exposure reliably achieved 5 log removal of ms2 bacteriophage fig 2 a combination of a 10 mg min l free chlorine exposure and 140 mg min l combined chlorine exposure i e 150 mg min l total chlorine exposure reliably reduced total coliform concentrations below 2 2 mpn 100 ml fig 3 nearly 3 log inactivation if free chlorine were dosed to achieve a 4 mg l as cl2 residual just prior to ammonia addition to form a chloramine residual the free chlorine and chloramine contact times would be approximately 2 5 min and 35 min respectively these contact times may be readily achievable within a treatment plant s chlorine contact basin in california for example chlorine contact basins for non potable reuse are sized to provide a 90 minute modal contact time utilities practicing dpr would also need to meet regulatory limits on dbps selecting a free chlorine exposure that balances the formation of regulated thm4 haa5 and nitrosamines may prove particularly challenging at the minimum free chlorine exposure needed to meet pathogen inactivation goals 10 mg min l and following 24 h of chloramine contact the formation of regulated thm4 and haa5 was well below the 80 μg l and 60 μg l mcls respectively fig 4 and fig s1 the majority of the thm and haa formation occurred within the free chlorine contact time as opposed to during 24 h chloramination fig 4 at 10 mg min l free chlorine exposure ndma still exceeded the 10 ng l ca notification level with 36 ng l and 29 ng l during events 1 and 2 respectively fig 4 and fig s1 although increasing the free chlorine exposure to 20 mg min l significantly reduced ndma formation an exposure near 30 mg min l was needed to eliminate ndma formation even then the background ndma concentrations in the filtered tertiary effluent were at the 10 ng l notification level however at 20 mg min l free chlorine exposure the thm4 formation approached or exceeded the 80 μg l mcl thus it may not be possible to select a free chlorine exposure to simultaneously meet pathogen inactivation goals and control of regulated thms haas and nitrosamines one option is to use the minimal free chlorine exposure that meets pathogen inactivation goals i e 10 mg min l to minimize the formation of regulated thm4 and haa5 and rely on the downstream advanced treatment train to control ndma concentrations within advanced treatment trains for potable reuse both ndma and thm4 are poorly removed by ro zeng et al 2016b however many advanced treatment trains employ high dose uv systems that effectively photolyze ndma gerrity et al 2013 zeng et al 2016b because these uv systems are less effective for removing thm4 and other unregulated halogenated dbps chuang et al 2016 it may be preferable to focus on pathogen inactivation and minimizing halogenated dbp formation rather than nitrosamine formation upstream of the advanced treatment train given the difficulty of selecting a free chlorine exposure that simultaneously meets all pathogen and dbp goals another option is to select a free chlorine exposure that meets pathogen inactivation goals while minimizing the overall formation of dbps including the unregulated classes the 10 mg min l free chlorine exposure required to meet pathogen inactivation goals also minimized the total formation of dbps on a mass basis including the unregulated halogenated classes fig 5 and fig s2 the contribution of an individual dbp to the toxicity of a disinfected water is a function of both its concentration and its toxic potency for example though ndma occurs at orders of magnitude lower concentrations than thms it exhibits higher toxic potency accordingly the measured concentrations of individual dbps were weighted by metrics of toxic potency tables s2 and s3 and then compared to the sum of these toxicity weighted dbp concentrations for different free chlorine exposures fig 6 figs s3 and s4 these calculations indicate that the minimum free chlorine exposure required for compliance with pathogen inactivation goals may also minimize the calculated dbp associated toxicity despite maximizing ndma formation interestingly the haloacetaldehydes hals haloacetonitriles hans and haloacetamides hams dominated the calculated dbp associated toxicity not the thm4 haa5 and nitrosamines of current regulatory interest with the exception of bromoacetic acid during event 2 fig s4 significant contributions of unregulated dbps to the calculated dbp associated toxicity of disinfected waters were previously observed in chlorine and chloramine disinfected brackish groundwaters szczuka et al 2017 potable reuse effluents treated by reverse osmosis and advanced oxidation zeng et al 2016b and potable reuse effluents treated by ozone and biological activated carbon chuang and mitch 2017 while these results can be used to suggest the potential importance of dbp classes additional research is needed to validate their contributions to the toxicity of disinfected wastewaters including the application of toxicity bioassays to complex mixtures associated with disinfected wastewaters the results herein were consistent over four sampling rounds conducted over two different days both with low levels of ammonia in the influent and with supplemented ammonia in the influent representative of the normal function and of upsets to the biological nitrification process respectively while there should be qualitative similarities between nitrified tertiary effluents from different facilities with respect to the tradeoffs between pathogen inactivation and formation of different dbp classes differences in absolute concentrations are expected for example the concentrations of ndma and chloramine reactive ndma precursors in the tertiary effluent vary widely in different sewersheds sedlak et al 2005 affecting the ndma concentrations that could be achieved with high free chlorine exposures pathogen surrogate inactivation and dbp formation have rarely been evaluated simultaneously li and mitch 2018 particularly with respect to wastewater disinfection for utilities interested in potable reuse this type of analysis will be needed to optimize disinfection systems upstream of advanced treatment trains for potable reuse 5 conclusions for direct potable reuse disinfection of fully nitrified filtered municipal wastewater effluents with free chlorine upstream of advanced treatment could be an option to obtain additional pathogen log inactivation credits thereafter ammonia could be added to form chloramines to inhibit biofilm growth on membranes within the advanced treatment train however the free chlorine ct must be optimized to balance the increase in pathogen inactivation and reduction in ndma formation against the increased formation of halogenated dbps this pilot study found that a 3 mg min l chlorine ct could reliably achieve 5 log inactivation of ms2 bacteriophage even in the presence of up to 1 6 ntu turbidity or when up to 1 5 mg l as n ammonia in the wastewater necessitated breakpoint chlorination to achieve a free chlorine residual a combination of 10 mg min l chlorine ct with 140 mg min l chloramine ct reduced total coliform concentrations below 2 2 mpn 100 ml a 30 mg min l free chlorine ct was needed to eliminate ndma formation during chloramination but this chlorine exposure increased the formation of thms and haas with thms approaching or exceeding the maximum contaminant level for thms the formation of unregulated halogenated dbp classes also increased with free chlorine ct because some of these classes particularly haloacetonitriles and haloacetaldehydes may be significant contributors to the dbp associated toxicity of the disinfected effluent selecting a free chlorine ct just above that required for pathogen inactivation may optimize the balance between pathogen inactivation and dbp formation acknowledgements this work was supported by funding from

applications in practical wastewater treatment in this study we provided a simple protocol to modify the icpb process and enhance the degradation efficiency of oxytetracycline as shown in scheme 1 light excitation of photoelectrons coupled with bio photocatalysis was developed as a synergistic degradation method during the degradation process a carrier with higher porosity than those utilized in previous works was used instead of protecting biofilms by placing them inside carriers the photocatalysts and microorganisms were coated full of the carriers the transfer of the light excited photoelectrons between photocatalysts and microorganisms occurred under visible light irradiation thus photocatalytic degradation microbial metabolic degradation and the transfer of photoelectrons between photocatalysts and microbes as an assisted degradation method occurred simultaneously many studies have illustrated the sterilization effect of photocatalysis however it has been demonstrated that microorganisms could use light excited electrons through the photocatalysis of semiconductors to stimulate growth sustain cellular metabolism regulate community structure and contribute to environmental remediation duan et al 2013 lovley 2011 lu et al 2012 sakimoto et al 2016 in addition although microbes should have been protected inside the carriers in the previous works few bacteria were still found on the outer surfaces of carriers li et al 2012a zhou et al 2015 indicating the survival of microbes and their resistance to negative influences to demonstrate the feasibility of this protocol the degradation efficiency evolution of byproducts the stability of degradation performance for oxytetracycline and bio transformation during the process were evaluated the results confirmed that stimulating the transfer of photoelectrons between photocatalysts and microbes was a useful method to enhance the degradation efficiency of the bio photocatalysis process 2 materials and methods

for 5 min finally the coated carriers were dried and the coating coverage on the carriers was determined to be 18 3 2 3 microbe cultivation method we collected swine wastewater effluent from a farm lesen xiamen china after diluting the wastewater using 100 mm phosphate buffer solution pbs ph 7 0 the supernatant was collected and oxytetracycline was added as carbon source finally 10 0 mg l

equipped with a filter was used as visible light source the light intensity was 80 mw cm2 which was close to the average value of the visible light spectrum of sunlight photocatalytic experiments were carried out at 22 2 c while using a circulating water system to prevent thermal catalytic effects the initial concentration of oxytetracycline for the degradation tests was 10 0 mg l for the static system each experiment was conducted using a 150 ml beaker containing 75 ml of degradation liquid table s3 the concentration of bi12o17cl2 used was 1 0 mg ml a shimadzu toc vwp analyzer was used to

as shown in table s4 the influent was supplied at a flow rate of 0 41 ml min which provided a hydraulic retention time hrt of 4 0 h both bi12o17cl2 and the microorganisms were coated on the carriers

instruments inc china we used blank or modified stainless steel wire 1 0 1 5 cm as working electrodes a carbon rod as counter electrode ag agcl kcl sat d as reference electrode and 100 mm pbs ph 7 0 as electrolyte we obtained amperometric i t curves and conducted photo electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis analysis without bias linear sweep voltammograms were measured between 0 45 and 0 85 v moreover we used a light density of 80 mw cm2 for each illuminated test 2 7 microbial community analysis bio samples were collected to study the biotransformation that occurred during the removal of oxytetracycline from the synergetic system the raw sample was coated onto the carriers before the test the bp samples were microorganisms from the synergetic system after 400 h of degradation dna extraction was carried out using a fastdna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals usa the extracted dna samples were analyzed at majorbio bio pharm technology co ltd shanghai china the selected bacterial

below 25 were removed ten unique barcodes were used to accurately allocate the sequences of each sample and only the sequences with identity above 97 were divided for operational taxonomic unit otu analysis the most abundant sequence was defined as the representative sequence and was assigned by python nearest alignment space termination pynast then employed for clarification of the taxonomy according to the greengenes database 3 results and discussion 3 1 enhanced removal of oxytetracycline by synergistic degradation for the static test the concentration change protocols for different mechanisms during short term experiments 10 h are shown in fig 1 a light excitation of photoelectrons coupled with bio photocatalysis was used as a synergistic degradation method in addition the influence of absorption photolysis biodegradation and photocatalytic degradation of oxytetracycline had to be taken into consideration for the absorption performance the final removal rates of the polyurethane carriers and bi12o17cl2 were 19 55 2 53 and 52 86 4 07 respectively otherwise oxytetracycline was rather stable under visible light irradiation as the final removal rate of the photolytic process was 29 15 1 84 in addition oxytetracycline proved to be significantly refractory and bio recalcitrant the bio removal rate was 68 39 1 94 after 10 h even though the microbes had been cultivated in 10 0 mg l oxytetracycline for one year thus we concluded that oxytetracycline could not be efficiently degraded in the natural environment combining the photocatalysis function significantly increased the removal rates for the photocatalysis and synergistic degradation of oxytetracycline due to the detection limit of the instrument the remnant oxytetracycline after photocatalysis and the synergistic degradation could not be detected after 4 h when the final removal rates were 92 39 2 51 and 96 16 3 63 respectively fitting these results to the first order reaction model further confirmed the rapid removal rate of oxytetracycline using photocatalysis and the synergetic system the rate constants k for the photocatalytic and synergistic degradation were 27 3 and 18 7 times higher respectively than that of biodegradation alone revealing the much more efficient removal of oxytetracycline through photocatalysis using bi12o17cl2 during the short term experiment for further investigating the superior degradation performance of the synergetic degradation system we tested the remnant toc from photocatalysis and the synergetic system as shown in fig 1b a nearly additional 14 3 removal rate of toc was obtained using the synergetic degradation function compared to photocatalytic degradation alone notably the extra removal of toc should be attributed to the combined microbial system revealing the maintaining of microbial activity in the synergetic system and the advantage of the synergetic degradation function three dimensional fluorescence spectra fig s4 tests also revealed that both photocatalytic and microbial degradation occurred during the synergetic degradation process moreover the results revealed that for the short time experiment conducted without protecting the microbes inside the carrier the light excited photoelectrons coupled with the bio photocatalytic degradation system performed well in the modified carrier 3 2 degradation intermediates of oxytetracycline by synergistic degradation the highlighted byproducts generated during the short term experiment by the synergistic degradation system were explored using mass spectrometry the retention times formulas and proposed structures of the products are presented in table 1 the evolution of each byproduct is displayed in fig 2 a and the spectra of the extracted ions are illustrated in fig s5 seven compounds with different molecular weights were identified using the positive ionization mode of the mass spectrometer within the 100 1000 m z range table 1 the m z of 461 1545 which corresponded oxytetracycline was reduced dramatically within 2 5 h fig 2a this was consistent with the results in fig 1a the detected byproducts were formed within 10 min fig 2a accumulated prior to 60 min and showed dramatic reduction in concentrations thereafter however only one of the six identified intermediates β apo oxytetracycline which had an m z of 443 4102 has been previously reported as a degradation product of oxytetracycline thus we evaluated the toxicities of the identified intermediates β apo oxytetracycline m z of 443 4102 one of the main antimicrobial active degradation products of oxytetracycline was reported to be quite stable exhibiting a half life of 270 d in soil interstitial water halling sørensen et al 2003 moreover β apo oxytetracycline was found in animal tissue agricultural products and dosage forms loke et al 2003 in the synergistic degradation process β apo oxytetracycline was detected at 10 min and without further accumulation this observation was also confirmed using the β apo oxytetracycline standard employing an analytical method previously reported in the literature halling sørensen et al 2003 fig 2b apparently β apo oxytetracycline is harmful and difficult to be decomposed in the natural environment its quick decomposition by the photoelectron coupled bio photocatalytic degradation system should contribute to the synergistic performance cyclandelate m z of 277 1789 plays an important role in the treatment of hemorheological disorders and thrombosis diener et al 1996 dicyclohexylamine m z of 182 1889 has always been detected in hive products heever et al 2014 although chronic exposure to isophorone m z of 139 1114 could increase the possibility of developing dizziness or depression photooxidation could efficiently remove isophorone and thus reduced its negative effects on the environment borup and middlebrooks 1987 wei et al 2013 thus low dose isophorone fig 2a could be easily removed using the synthetic degradation procedure the product with m z of 149 0957 which may be trans anethole was reported to undergo efficient metabolic detoxication and did not present any significant risk to human health newberne et al 1999 in addition sorbic acid m z of 113 0596 was rapidly metabolized and did not exhibit carcinogenic activity walker 1990 food safety and human health concerns should never be ignored however negative consequences always involve long term exposure and high enough dosage of harmful agents the evolution of the main intermediates of the synergistic oxytetracycline degradation illustrated an efficient removal of these compounds without any accumulation after 60 min of operation indicating the enhanced degradation of oxytetracycline and the decomposition of the subsequent intermediates compared with previous works that analyzed the degradation of oxytetracycline halling sørensen et al 2003 liu et al 2016 the degradation reaction using the synergetic degradation system was more efficient 3 3 degradation stability of oxytetracycline by synergistic degradation as the degradation process progressed it was observed that the efficiency of the degradation gradually declined because of biofilms detachment and the decrease in catalytic activity of photocatalysts to measure the stability of this type of photoelectron coupled bio photocatalytic system for degrading oxytetracycline the continuous biodegradation photocatalytic and the synergetic degradation with a hydraulic retention time hrt of 4 0 h was tested for 400 h fig 3 after adjusting for the first few hours the removal rate of oxytetracycline by only the biodegradation process gradually increased this should be attributed to the function of the microbial metabolism and absorption ability of the formed biofilm however the removal rate dramatically reduced after 228 h of operation due to the detachment of biofilms and desorption of oxytetracycline the photocatalytic degradation process showed excellent elimination capability for oxytetracycline moreover no significant differences could be observed between the process and the synergistic degradation process over a long period of time however the photocatalytic degradation rate started to decrease after 156 h and the final rate was only 67 this was probably due to the decrease in the catalytic activity of the photocatalysts after prolonged illumination and operation unlike the performance of biodegradation or photocatalysis the efficiency of the synergetic degradation process remained above 94 for the entire experimental period indicating that the photoelectron coupled bio photocatalytic degradation system could maintain good degradation stability and acclimate to the moving environment this finding also illustrated that even for tests conducted over long periods of time the coated microbes of the synergistic system was not apoptosis and microbial activity was well maintained in addition the biotoxicity of the effluent after 400 h of synergistic degradation was investigated by inoculating escherichia coli dh5α using the effluent fig s6 the inhibitory effect of oxytetracycline was obvious compared with the milli q group however after the synergistic degradation treatment the biotoxicity and antibacterial activity of the effluent were dramatically reduced according to our results the synergetic degradation protocol not only exhibited a high degradation rate for oxytetracycline but also maintained the ability to decompose its intermediates 3 4 photo electrochemical measurements as mentioned above the synergetic degradation procedure could not simply be separated into biodegradation and photocatalytic degradation adequate exposure to visible light induced the transfer of photoelectrons between the two attached parts and this was utilized for environmental remediation jiang et al 2014 li et al 2014 the existing connections between the photocatalyst and microbes may provide the potential for synergistic energy conversion and contribute to the enhanced degradation of oxytetracycline as evidence photo electrochemical tests were performed to illustrate the interplay electron transfer between bi12o17cl2 and microbes under visible light irradiation during electrochemical tests blank and coated stainless steel meshes were utilized as photo anodes because the wire ingredient and net structure of the stainless steel mesh were analogous to the sponge carrier the good conductivity of the mesh also ensured the timely collection of electrons in fig 4 a a photocurrent was immediately induced after the illumination of bi12o17cl2 using visible light and no bias because the electrons were excited into the conduction band and holes positive charges were generated in the valence band when the illumination was stopped the photocurrent declined indicating that bi12o17cl2 acted as photocatalyst and the transport of photoelectrons was fast theoretically when the electrode was coated with microbes the obtained photocurrent would be reduced because light would be obstructed from reaching the photocatalysts and microbes would be insensitive to light irradiation however when the electrode was coated with microbes the photocurrent did not decline the photocatalytic activity maintained revealing an additional electron transfer pathway in the synergetic system in addition photoelectrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis and linear sweep voltammetry were further used to expound the electron transmission at the interface between bi12o17cl2 and microbes the improved conductivity of the synergetic system compared to the photocatalyst alone was evidenced by the eis results fig 4b it was obvious that the synergetic system showed a smaller circle in both the low and high frequency regions than the photocatalytic system alone hence the synergetic interface was more conducive to electron transmission than the photocatalyst without bias the decrease in circles was small after the light irradiation linear sweep voltammetry within the 0 45 0 85 v potential range versus ag agcl kcl sat d was used to represent the effect of different potentials on photocurrent promotion fig 4c the stainless steel mesh was electrochemically stable in this potential range and most of the bio electrochemical signal could be excluded the current of the synergetic system was higher than of the photocatalytic system in the dark which was consistent with the eis test results under visible light illumination the photocurrent gradually increased the photoinduced current reached 52 1 and 39 9 μa cm2 for the synergetic and photocatalytic systems respectively at 0 8 v the extra photocurrent should be attributed to the transfer of photoelectrons between bi12o17cl2 and the microbes this implied that the synergistic system could generated more electrons for transfer than the photocatalytic system alone which confirmed the existence of a transfer of photoelectrons between the microbes and bi12o17cl2 in the presence of light 3 5 coated microbes and functionalized microbial community the carriers were collected some were coated only with bi12o17cl2 and some underwent synergetic degradation for 400 h as shown in fig 5 compared to the blank carrier fig 5a and b the surface of each carrier fiber become rough after coating with bi12o17cl2 fig 5c and d after the microbe culture the porosity of the carrier decreased and microorganisms attached tightly to bi12o17cl2 fig 5e and f instead of forming a condensed biofilm microbes were dispersed three reasons might contribute to this phenomenon first without the protection of the carrier direct exposure to toxicants and oxidants would exert negative effects on the formation of biofilms second the light excited photoelectrons however could be harvested by microbes to stimulate their growth and modulate the microbial community to acclimate to the surrounding environment third the big porosity of the carrier provided channels for the easy transmission of substrates and the free radicals could undergo immediate degradation thus their negative influence on the microbes could be weakened the microbial community transformation analysis revealed that the bacterial community was regulated after a long degradation process fig s7 except for the original three classes of grammaproteobacteria bacilli and flavobacteria five additional classes flourished beta proteobacteria alpha proteobacteria clostridia sphingobacteria and actinobacteria the heat map fig 6 clearly displayed the evolution of the microbial community at the genus level rhodopseudomonas which was both phototrophic and chemotropic emerged after the degradation process larimer et al 2004 indicating an adaption to the synergetic environment rhodopseudomonas martin et al 1986 lysinibacillus nandy et al 2013 sphingobacterium pseudomonas burkholderia escherichia and bacillus which were much abundant have the ability of extracellular transfer electrons huang et al 2011 revealing the potential for the transfer of photoelectrons between the microbes and photocatalysts in addition the population of pseudomonas kiyohara et al 1992 stenotrophomonas qureshi et al 2007 achromobacter wang et al 2016 and sphingomonas ye et al 1996 which were capable of scavenging aromatic hydrocarbons were largely increased the newly emerged mycobacterium schneider et al 1996 comamonas goyal and zylstra 1996 lysinibacillus atefeh et al 2013 dokdonella bacosa and inoue 2015 sulfobacillus zhou et al 2016 bacillus arutchelvan et al 2006 pandoraea wang et al 2015 and ochrobacturm ghosal et al 2010 genera were also able to degrade aromatic hydrocarbons moreover mesorhizobium okada et al 2005 and methylobacterium jourand et al 2004 contributed to the denitrification process while labrys amorim et al 2014 and sphingobacterium ghosh et al 2009 were reported to degrade antibiotics the flourishing of these microorganisms expounded the formation of functional microbial groups for the degradation of oxytetracycline and mineralization of byproducts the results also validated the feasibility of the design protocol in this study given a suitable porosity of carrier the microbes need not be cultivated just inside carriers for protection purposes the energy source generated by the light excited photoelectrons could be used by microbes to reconstruct their microbial communities to adapt to the environment 4 conclusions in this study a simple protocol was developed to enhance the bio photocatalytic degradation efficiency of oxytetracycline by stimulating the transfer of photoelectrons between the photocatalysts and microbes using a higher porosity carrier 95 the protocol did not involve the additional of supplementary electron donors for microbe metabolism or improving the loading rate of the photocatalysts although exposure to toxicants and oxidants the negative influence on microbes could be weakened a removal rate of 94 was maintained for 400 h and the lack of cytotoxic effects of the effluent demonstrated the degradation stability of the synergistic degradation system in addition β apo oxytetracycline the refractory and antimicrobial active intermediate in the degradation of oxytetracycline could be further degraded in 10 min without accumulation therefore we provide a simple and efficient strategy to enhance the degradation efficiency of the bio photocatalytic process for oxytetracycline and confirms the potential application value of the strategy for

lesen xiamen china after diluting the wastewater using 100 mm phosphate buffer solution pbs ph 7 0 the supernatant was collected and oxytetracycline was added as carbon source finally 10 0 mg l oxytetracycline was added during the acclimation of microbes for approximately one year to simulate the proliferation of functional microbial groups as it would occur in wastewaters containing a high concentration of oxytetracycline subsequently the acclimated microbes were separated by centrifugation at 7500 rpm for 10 min for cultivation the bi12o17cl2 coated carriers and collected microbes were mixed in a culture solution that contained 100 mm pbs a nitrogen source and sodium acetate table s2 cultivation lasted for one week and the supporting solution was refreshed every two days 2 4

equipped with a filter was used as visible light source the light intensity was 80 mw cm2 which was close to the average value of the visible light spectrum of sunlight photocatalytic experiments were carried out at 22 2 c while using a circulating water system to prevent thermal catalytic effects the initial concentration of oxytetracycline for the degradation tests was 10 0 mg l for the static system each experiment was conducted using a 150 ml beaker containing 75 ml of degradation liquid table s3 the concentration of bi12o17cl2 used was 1 0 mg ml a shimadzu toc vwp analyzer was used to determine the total organic carbon toc the synergistic degradation activities in the perturbed system were evaluated by mixing the degradation liquid table s3 with supplemental inorganic salt 10 ml l as shown in table s4 the influent was supplied at a flow rate of 0 41 ml min which provided a hydraulic retention time hrt of 4 0 h both bi12o17cl2 and the microorganisms were coated on the carriers for photocatalytic degradation and biodegradation 2 5 analytical methods the remnant oxytetracycline was analyzed using a hitachi l 2000 series hplc instrument with uv detection at 278 nm each sample

instruments inc china we used blank or modified stainless steel wire 1 0 1 5 cm as working electrodes a carbon rod as counter electrode ag agcl kcl sat d as reference electrode and 100 mm pbs ph 7 0 as electrolyte we obtained amperometric i t curves and conducted photo electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis analysis without bias linear sweep voltammograms were measured between 0 45 and 0 85 v moreover we used a light density of 80 mw cm2 for each illuminated test 2 7 microbial community analysis bio samples were collected to study the biotransformation that occurred during the removal of oxytetracycline from the synergetic system the raw sample was coated onto the carriers before the test the bp samples were microorganisms from the synergetic system after 400 h of degradation dna extraction was carried out using a fastdna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals usa the extracted dna samples were analyzed at majorbio bio pharm technology co ltd shanghai china the selected bacterial

extension was conducted at 72 c for 10 0 min the quantitative insights into microbial ecology qiime software was used to process the data the data that were shorter than 200 bp and had a quality score below 25 were removed ten unique barcodes were used to accurately allocate the sequences of each sample and only the sequences with identity above 97 were divided for operational taxonomic unit otu analysis the most abundant sequence was defined as the representative sequence and was assigned by python nearest alignment space termination pynast then employed for clarification of the taxonomy according to the greengenes database 3 results and discussion 3 1 enhanced removal of oxytetracycline by synergistic degradation for the static test the concentration change protocols for different mechanisms during short term experiments 10 h are shown in fig 1 a light excitation of photoelectrons coupled with bio photocatalysis was used as a synergistic degradation method in addition the influence of absorption photolysis biodegradation and photocatalytic degradation of oxytetracycline had to be taken into consideration for the absorption performance the final removal rates of the polyurethane carriers and bi12o17cl2 were 19 55 2 53 and 52 86 4 07 respectively otherwise oxytetracycline was rather stable under visible light irradiation as the final removal rate of the photolytic process was 29 15 1 84 in addition oxytetracycline proved to be significantly refractory and bio recalcitrant the bio removal rate was 68 39 1 94 after 10 h even though the microbes had been cultivated in 10 0 mg l oxytetracycline for one year thus we concluded that oxytetracycline could not be efficiently degraded in the natural environment combining the photocatalysis function significantly increased the removal rates for the photocatalysis and synergistic degradation of oxytetracycline due to the detection limit of the instrument the remnant oxytetracycline after photocatalysis and the synergistic degradation could not be detected after 4 h when the final removal rates were 92 39 2 51 and 96 16 3 63 respectively fitting these results to the first order reaction model further confirmed the rapid removal rate of oxytetracycline using photocatalysis and the synergetic system the rate constants k for the photocatalytic and synergistic degradation were 27 3 and 18 7 times higher respectively than that of biodegradation alone revealing the much more efficient removal of oxytetracycline through photocatalysis using bi12o17cl2 during the short term experiment for further investigating the superior degradation performance of the synergetic degradation system we tested the remnant toc from photocatalysis and the synergetic system as shown in fig 1b a nearly additional 14 3 removal rate of toc was obtained using the synergetic degradation function compared to photocatalytic degradation alone notably the extra removal of toc should be attributed to the combined microbial system revealing the maintaining of microbial activity in the synergetic system and the advantage of the synergetic degradation function three dimensional fluorescence spectra fig s4 tests also revealed that both photocatalytic and microbial degradation occurred during the synergetic degradation process moreover the results revealed that for the short time experiment conducted without protecting the microbes inside the carrier the light excited photoelectrons coupled with the bio photocatalytic degradation system performed well in the modified carrier 3 2 degradation intermediates of oxytetracycline by synergistic degradation the highlighted byproducts generated during the short term experiment by the synergistic degradation system were explored using mass spectrometry the retention times formulas and proposed structures of the products are presented in table 1 the evolution of each byproduct is displayed in fig 2 a and the spectra of the extracted ions are illustrated in fig s5 seven compounds with different molecular weights were identified using the positive ionization mode of the mass spectrometer within the 100 1000 m z range table 1 the m z of 461 1545 which corresponded oxytetracycline was reduced dramatically within 2 5 h fig 2a this was consistent with the results in fig 1a the detected byproducts were formed within 10 min fig 2a accumulated prior to 60 min and showed dramatic reduction in concentrations thereafter however only one of the six identified intermediates β apo oxytetracycline which had an m z of 443 4102 has been previously reported as a degradation product of oxytetracycline thus we evaluated the toxicities of the identified intermediates β apo oxytetracycline m z of 443 4102 one of the main antimicrobial active degradation products of oxytetracycline was reported to be quite stable exhibiting a half life of 270 d in soil interstitial water halling sørensen et al 2003 moreover β apo oxytetracycline was found in animal tissue agricultural products and dosage forms loke et al 2003 in the synergistic degradation process β apo oxytetracycline was detected at 10 min and without further accumulation this observation was also confirmed using the β apo oxytetracycline standard employing an analytical method previously reported in the literature halling sørensen et al 2003 fig 2b apparently β apo oxytetracycline is harmful and difficult to be decomposed in the natural environment its quick decomposition by the photoelectron coupled bio photocatalytic degradation system should contribute to the synergistic performance cyclandelate m z of 277 1789 plays an important role in the treatment of hemorheological disorders and thrombosis diener et al 1996 dicyclohexylamine m z of 182 1889 has always been detected in hive products heever et al 2014 although chronic exposure to isophorone m z of 139 1114 could increase the possibility of developing dizziness or depression photooxidation could efficiently remove isophorone and thus reduced its negative effects on the environment borup and middlebrooks 1987 wei et al 2013 thus low dose isophorone fig 2a could be easily removed using the synthetic degradation procedure the product with m z of 149 0957 which may be trans anethole was reported to undergo efficient metabolic detoxication and did not present any significant risk to human health newberne et al 1999 in addition sorbic acid m z of 113 0596 was rapidly metabolized and did not exhibit carcinogenic activity walker 1990 food safety and human health concerns should never be ignored however negative consequences always involve long term exposure and high enough dosage of harmful agents the evolution of the main intermediates of the synergistic oxytetracycline degradation illustrated an efficient removal of these compounds without any accumulation after 60 min of operation indicating the enhanced degradation of oxytetracycline and the decomposition of the subsequent intermediates compared with previous works that analyzed the degradation of oxytetracycline halling sørensen et al 2003 liu et al 2016 the degradation reaction using the synergetic degradation system was more efficient 3 3 degradation stability of oxytetracycline by synergistic degradation as the degradation process progressed it was observed that the efficiency of the degradation gradually declined because of biofilms detachment and the decrease in catalytic activity of photocatalysts to measure the stability of this type of photoelectron coupled bio photocatalytic system for degrading oxytetracycline the continuous biodegradation photocatalytic and the synergetic degradation with a hydraulic retention time hrt of 4 0 h was tested for 400 h fig 3 after adjusting for the first few hours the removal rate of oxytetracycline by only the biodegradation process gradually increased this should be attributed to the function of the microbial metabolism and absorption ability of the formed biofilm however the removal rate dramatically reduced after 228 h of operation due to the detachment of biofilms and desorption of oxytetracycline the photocatalytic degradation process showed excellent elimination capability for oxytetracycline moreover no significant differences could be observed between the process and the synergistic degradation process over a long period of time however the photocatalytic degradation rate started to decrease after 156 h and the final rate was only 67 this was probably due to the decrease in the catalytic activity of the photocatalysts after prolonged illumination and operation unlike the performance of biodegradation or photocatalysis the efficiency of the synergetic degradation process remained above 94 for the entire experimental period indicating that the photoelectron coupled bio photocatalytic degradation system could maintain good degradation stability and acclimate to the moving environment this finding also illustrated that even for tests conducted over long periods of time the coated microbes of the synergistic system was not apoptosis and microbial activity was well maintained in addition the biotoxicity of the effluent after 400 h of synergistic degradation was investigated by inoculating escherichia coli dh5α using the effluent fig s6 the inhibitory effect of oxytetracycline was obvious compared with the milli q group however after the synergistic degradation treatment the biotoxicity and antibacterial activity of the effluent were dramatically reduced according to our results the synergetic degradation protocol not only exhibited a high degradation rate for oxytetracycline but also maintained the ability to decompose its intermediates 3 4 photo electrochemical measurements as mentioned above the synergetic degradation procedure could not simply be separated into biodegradation and photocatalytic degradation adequate exposure to visible light induced the transfer of photoelectrons between the two attached parts and this was utilized for environmental remediation jiang et al 2014 li et al 2014 the existing connections between the photocatalyst and microbes may provide the potential for synergistic energy conversion and contribute to the enhanced degradation of oxytetracycline as evidence photo electrochemical tests were performed to illustrate the interplay electron transfer between bi12o17cl2 and microbes under visible light irradiation during electrochemical tests blank and coated stainless steel meshes were utilized as photo anodes because the wire ingredient and net structure of the stainless steel mesh were analogous to the sponge carrier the good conductivity of the mesh also ensured the timely collection of electrons in fig 4 a a photocurrent was immediately induced after the illumination of bi12o17cl2 using visible light and no bias because the electrons were excited into the conduction band and holes positive charges were generated in the valence band when the illumination was stopped the photocurrent declined indicating that bi12o17cl2 acted as photocatalyst and the transport of photoelectrons was fast theoretically when the electrode was coated with microbes the obtained photocurrent would be reduced because light would be obstructed from reaching the photocatalysts and microbes would be insensitive to light irradiation however when the electrode was coated with microbes the photocurrent did not decline the photocatalytic activity maintained revealing an additional electron transfer pathway in the synergetic system in addition photoelectrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis and linear sweep voltammetry were further used to expound the electron transmission at the interface between bi12o17cl2 and microbes the improved conductivity of the synergetic system compared to the photocatalyst alone was evidenced by the eis results fig 4b it was obvious that the synergetic system showed a smaller circle in both the low and high frequency regions than the photocatalytic system alone hence the synergetic interface was more conducive to electron transmission than the photocatalyst without bias the decrease in circles was small after the light irradiation linear sweep voltammetry within the 0 45 0 85 v potential range versus ag agcl kcl sat d was used to represent the effect of different potentials on photocurrent promotion fig 4c the stainless steel mesh was electrochemically stable in this potential range and most of the bio electrochemical signal could be excluded the current of the synergetic system was higher than of the photocatalytic system in the dark which was consistent with the eis test results under visible light illumination the photocurrent gradually increased the photoinduced current reached 52 1 and 39 9 μa cm2 for the synergetic and photocatalytic systems respectively at 0 8 v the extra photocurrent should be attributed to the transfer of photoelectrons between bi12o17cl2 and the microbes this implied that the synergistic system could generated more electrons for transfer than the photocatalytic system alone which confirmed the existence of a transfer of photoelectrons between the microbes and bi12o17cl2 in the presence of light 3 5 coated microbes and functionalized microbial community the carriers were collected some were coated only with bi12o17cl2 and some underwent synergetic degradation for 400 h as shown in fig 5 compared to the blank carrier fig 5a and b the surface of each carrier fiber become rough after coating with bi12o17cl2 fig 5c and d after the microbe culture the porosity of the carrier decreased and microorganisms attached tightly to bi12o17cl2 fig 5e and f instead of forming a condensed biofilm microbes were dispersed three reasons might contribute to this phenomenon first without the protection of the carrier direct exposure to toxicants and oxidants would exert negative effects on the formation of biofilms second the light excited photoelectrons however could be harvested by microbes to stimulate their growth and modulate the microbial community to acclimate to the surrounding environment third the big porosity of the carrier provided channels for the easy transmission of substrates and the free radicals could undergo immediate degradation thus their negative influence on the microbes could be weakened the microbial community transformation analysis revealed that the bacterial community was regulated after a long degradation process fig s7 except for the original three classes of grammaproteobacteria bacilli and flavobacteria five additional classes flourished beta proteobacteria alpha proteobacteria clostridia sphingobacteria and actinobacteria the heat map fig 6 clearly displayed the evolution of the microbial community at the genus level rhodopseudomonas which was both phototrophic and chemotropic emerged after the degradation process larimer et al 2004 indicating an adaption to the synergetic environment rhodopseudomonas martin et al 1986 lysinibacillus nandy et al 2013 sphingobacterium pseudomonas burkholderia escherichia and bacillus which were much abundant have the ability of extracellular transfer electrons huang et al 2011 revealing the potential for the transfer of photoelectrons between the microbes and photocatalysts in addition the population of pseudomonas kiyohara et al 1992 stenotrophomonas qureshi et al 2007 achromobacter wang et al 2016 and sphingomonas ye et al 1996 which were capable of scavenging aromatic hydrocarbons were largely increased the newly emerged mycobacterium schneider et al 1996 comamonas goyal and zylstra 1996 lysinibacillus atefeh et al 2013 dokdonella bacosa and inoue 2015 sulfobacillus zhou et al 2016 bacillus arutchelvan et al 2006 pandoraea wang et al 2015 and ochrobacturm ghosal et al 2010 genera were also able to degrade aromatic hydrocarbons moreover mesorhizobium okada et al 2005 and methylobacterium jourand et al 2004 contributed to the denitrification process while labrys amorim et al 2014 and sphingobacterium ghosh et al 2009 were reported to degrade antibiotics the flourishing of these microorganisms expounded the formation of functional microbial groups for the degradation of oxytetracycline and mineralization of byproducts the results also validated the feasibility of the design protocol in this study given a suitable porosity of carrier the microbes need not be cultivated just inside carriers for protection purposes the energy source generated by the light excited photoelectrons could be used by microbes to reconstruct their microbial communities to adapt to the environment 4 conclusions in this study a simple protocol was developed to enhance the bio photocatalytic degradation efficiency of oxytetracycline by stimulating the transfer of photoelectrons between the photocatalysts and microbes using a higher porosity carrier 95 the protocol did not involve the additional of supplementary electron donors for microbe metabolism or improving the loading rate of the photocatalysts although exposure to toxicants and oxidants the negative influence on microbes could be weakened a removal rate of 94 was maintained for 400 h and the lack of cytotoxic effects of the effluent demonstrated the degradation stability of the synergistic degradation system in addition β apo oxytetracycline the refractory and antimicrobial active intermediate in the degradation of oxytetracycline could be further degraded in 10 min without accumulation therefore we provide a simple and efficient strategy to enhance the degradation efficiency of the bio photocatalytic process for oxytetracycline and confirms the potential application value of the strategy for

19453,previous studies have shown that the oxidation of fe ii by molecular oxygen can lead to the co oxidation of as iii at neutral ph however the mechanism of as iii oxidation in the presence of fe

were determined by cyclic voltammogram experiments with an electrochemical workstation chi600e ch instruments ins free radicals produced during fe ii autoxidation were detected by electron spin resonance esr spectroscopy using a japan electron optics laboratory co ltd fa200 spectrometer the concentration of h2o2 was determined using dpd photometric method at a wavelength of 551 nm wang et al 2013 the formation constant of fe ii as iii complex at neutral ph was calculated using ph metric titrations method proposed by bjerrum 1941 and modified by irving and rossotti 1954 except for special description the initial reaction rate expressed as r was determined from the linear fit of the plot of concentration versus reaction time within 0 5 min the details of analytical methods have been described in si 3 results and discussion 3 1 ph effect on co oxidation of as iii and fe ii the effect of ph on the co oxidation of as iii fig s3a and fe ii fig s3b was investigated at ph 6 0 8 0 for both as iii and fe ii oxidation the apparent ph dependence of initial oxidation rates of as iii r as iii and fe ii r fe ii followed the kinetic model eq 2 shown in fig s3c which implies that r as iii and r fe ii have a potential relationship as expected correlation analysis confirmed a linear positive correlation between r as iii and r fe ii fig 1 as the ph increased from 6 to 8 with a slope r fe ii r as iii of ca 20 the slope is twice the initial concentration ratio of fe ii as iii indicating that the oxidation efficiency of as iii is stoichiometrically lower than that of fe ii as shown in fig s3c as iii accelerated fe ii oxidation rates thus we determined the correlation between the increment of the fe ii oxidation rate δr fe ii described in eq 11 and r as iii fig 1 shows a linear positive correlation between δr fe ii and r as iii with a slope of ca 4 11 δr fe ii r fe ii r fe ii 0 where r fe ii and r fe ii 0 are the initial oxidation rates of fe ii with or without as iii respectively δr fe ii is the increment of the fe ii oxidation rate after addition of as iii we simulated the species distribution of fe ii fig s4 using medusa software ignoring the potential effect of as iii millo 1985 proposed that the formation of fe oh 2 species at ph above 6 is a key step in fe ii oxidation this is reasonable with respect to the concentration limit of fe iii free ion ca 10 14 m at ph 6 10 8 m oh which depends on the solubility product constant pk sp 38 55 of fe oh 3 precursor of cfh speight 2005 the same ph threshold 6 0 was also observed in as iii oxidation to as v fig s3c therefore as iii oxidation in nature depends on fe ii oxidation although the former apparently enhances the latter to achieve significant oxidation of as iii in a more stable fe ii fe iii solution we fixed the ph at 7 25 for all succeeding experiments 3 2 role of complexation between as iii and fe ii fe iii phosphate was added to the reaction solution to investigate its effect on the co oxidation of as iii and fe ii fig 2 a shows that phosphate slightly enhanced fe ii oxidation because of the formation of relatively labile dissolved ferrous phosphate complexes at ph 6 75 johnston and singer 2007 whereas fig 2b shows that phosphate prevented almost all as iii oxidation as the phosphate concentration increased to 250 μm in fe ii solution containing 250 μm phosphate 5 fold higher than fe ii only about 32 of fe ii formed iron ii phosphate complexes fehpo4 feh2po4 or fe3 po4 2 in the absence of as iii at ph 7 25 calculated by medusa software fig s5a about 10 12 1 m fe oh 2 remained which is close to the amount obtained without phosphate fig s4 formation of fepo4 2h2o rather than cfh fig s5b also limited as iii cfh complexation since phosphate has a strong ability to complex with fe ii fe iii and a chemical behavior similar to that of as iii and as v raven et al 1998 xu et al 2014 phosphate could compete with as iii in complexation with fe ii fe iii therefore the inhibitory effect was not only due to the formation of iron ii iii phosphate or scavenging of ho radical by phosphate rate constant 107 m 1 s 1 but also probably due to the competition of complexation between phosphate and as iii with fe ii or fe iii eqs 12 and 13 as iii reacts with ho radical at a much higher reaction constant 8 5 109 m 1 s 1 xu et al 2014 thus we considered that as iii might complex with fe ii or fe iii when fe oh 2 species or cfh formed and that oxidation of as iii occurred after these complexes formed 12 fe ii as iii fe ii as iii complex 13 fe iii as iii fe iii as iii complex the chelator dp favors the binding of fe ii ions over that of fe iii ions this step forms fe dp 3 2 in solution which exhibits no ability for activating oxygen li et al 2004 thus dp was added to confirm the effect of fe ii autoxidation on as iii oxidation as shown in fig s6a and b as iii oxidation and fe ii oxidation were simultaneously and almost completely inhibited as the concentration of dp increased up to 5 fold that of fe ii this result is consistent with the work of katsoyiannis et al 2008 showing that dp interrupts reactions of fe ii with o2 and h2o2 this result is also consistent with the very low concentrations of reactive fe oh 2 species in 50 μm fe ii solution containing 250 μm dp at ph 7 25 fig s5c therefore the complex between fe ii and as iii remained the ability for activating oxygen because complexation may change the fe iii fe ii or as v as iii reduction potentials we conducted cyclic voltammetry measurements in the absence of oxygen after as iii complexation with fe ii the fe iii fe ii reduction potential decreased from 0 072 to 0 11 v vs a saturated calomel electrode sce in fig s7a this result agrees with the decrease in fe iii fe ii reduction potential due to chelators complexation with fe ii via oxygen atoms welch et al 2002 meanwhile this complexation increased the as v as iii reduction potential from 0 68 to 0 97 v vs sce fig s7b suggesting that as iii oxidation with fe ii is more difficult than that without fe ii this finding seemingly contradicts the fast as iii oxidation in the presence of fe ii thus some oxidants should be generated to overcome the higher as v as iii reduction potential 3 3 role of ros in the co oxidation of as iii and fe ii according to the results and discussions above the oxidation of as iii might occur by ros ho h2o2 o2 or other oxidizing intermediates that were formed as intermediates during the fe ii oxidation by o2 thus the presence of a scavenger could inhibit the co oxidation of as iii and fe ii by quenching ros therefore verification experiments were conducted by adding ros scavengers to inhibit the possible action of radicals tba was used as a probe compound for ho in the photooxidation of as iii through the surface complexation with nascent colloidal ferric hydroxide and its concentration 20000 fold that of as iii was enough to quench almost all ho due to the reaction constant k ho tba 3 8 7 6 108 m 1 s 1 xu et al 2014 fig s8 shows almost no inhibition of oxidation of as iii or fe ii in the presence of excess tba which is in agreement with the results of experiments using 2 propanol as ho scavenger hug and leupin 2003 in addition esr spectroscopy showed no signals of dmpo oh adduct during the co oxidation of as iii and fe ii in the presence of dmpo fig s9 these results thus confirm that ho is not the key oxidant for as iii or fe ii cat could decompose h2o2 at neutral ph with a reaction constant of 7 9 106 m 1 s 1 and was used to identify the generation of h2o2 during fe ii polyphosphate complex oxidation by o2 biaglow and kachur 1997 thus cat was added to the reaction solution to investigate the inhibitory effect significant inhibition of co oxidation of both as iii fig 3 a and fe ii fig 3b was observed with 100 500 u ml 1 cat solution as the concentration of cat was increased to 500 u ml 1 fe ii oxidation was not completely inhibited r fe ii decreased from 1 22 to 0 25 μm min 1 whereas as iii oxidation was almost all inhibited r as iii decreased from 0 069 to 0 0095 μm min 1 these results demonstrate that h2o2 is crucial to the co oxidation of as iii and fe ii in neutral solution h2o2 was the only important oxidant for as iii oxidation while molecular oxygen was also another important oxidant for fe ii oxidation the yields of h2o2 in fe ii solutions with or without as iii were analyzed along with the autoxidation reactions fig 3c shows that the initial reaction rate within 0 10 min and final concentration at 60 min of h2o2 in the presence of as iii 0 31 μm min 1 and 5 4 μm are markedly higher than those in the absence of as iii 0 14 μm min 1 and 1 7 μm this result implies that as iii acts as a ligand for fe ii thus enhancing the production of h2o2 another ros ho2 or o2 is possibly produced during autoxidation of fe ii the neutral ph causes only o2 to be the predominant species as dictated by the acid dissociation constant pk a 4 8 of ho2 o2 reaction wood 1988 sod can react with ho2 o2 with a high reaction constant of 6 1 24 108 m 1 s 1 and was used to testify the generation of o2 during fe ii polyphosphate complex oxidation by o2 biaglow and kachur 1997 thus sod was added to the reaction solution to investigate the effect of o2 on the co oxidation of as iii and fe ii fig s10 shows that the oxidation of neither as iii nor fe ii can be changed even by increasing the sod concentration up to 96 u ml 1 this suggests that free o2 plays a minor role in the production of h2o2 or oxidation of as iii and that generation of h2o2 can be based on the two electron reduction of molecular oxygen via formation of an ions complex fe3 o2 2 fe3 which is stabilized by coulombic forces and may break up to form h2o2 weiss 1953 3 4 oxidation of as iii via reaction between fe ii as iii complexes and h2o2 direct oxidation of as iii by h2o2 in the absence of fe ii is hardly possible because of the very low reaction rate constant k 5 5 10 3 m 1 s 1 wang et al 2013 unless the h2o2 concentration is high enough e g several millimolar without iron no oxidation of as iii was observed fig s11 at the maximal concentration of h2o2 5 4 μm found in the as iii solution containing fe ii in this work however when we added h2o2 at various concentrations to the deoxygenated solutions containing fe ii and as iii co oxidation of as iii and fe ii occurred as shown in fig 4 a in this case co oxidation of as iii and fe ii occurred very quickly and terminated within 5 min reaching slopes of 0 040 k as v r as iii h2o2 and 0 316 k fe iii r fe ii h2o2 respectively moreover the stoichiometries of oxidized as iii and fe ii relative to h2o2 are 0 20 k as v t 0 040 5 and 1 58 k fe iii t 0 316 5 respectively the initial rate of h2o2 reaction was 0 31 μm min 1 fig 3c thus the calculated r as iii was 0 062 μm min 1 0 20 0 31 μm min 1 which is very close to that obtained using fe ii solution containing oxygen at ph 7 25 0 069 μm min 1 in fig s3c as the production rates of h2o2 increased from 0 14 to 0 31 μm min 1 after the addition of as iii fig 3c the increased fe ii oxidation rate was calculated to be 0 27 μm min 1 1 58 0 17 μm min 1 which is also identical to the calculated δr fe ii as shown in fig 1 thus one important conclusion that can be drawn is that as iii oxidation and the enhancement of fe ii oxidation during co oxidation of as iii and fe ii are exclusively attributed to the increased production of h2o2 along with the production of h2o2 as iii oxidation in fe ii solutions at neutral ph comprises the neutral fenton oxidation of as iii since ho does not cause as iii oxidation as reconfirmed in this work the proposed reaction involving fe iv hug and leupin 2003 should be demonstrated dmso reacts with fe iv by oxygen atom transfer and yields dimethyl sulfone whereas it reacts with hydroxyl radicals and generates methyl sulfinic acid and ethane thus dmso was used to verify the existence of fe iv in fenton reaction bataineh et al 2012 and heterogeneous fe 0 o2 systems containing as iii pang et al 2011 hence dmso could be used as a scavenger for fe iv in the absence of ho in this work excess dmso 400 mm inhibited most of as iii oxidation for 50 μm fe ii and 5 μm as iii in the presence of 5 4 μm h2o2 under a nitrogen atmosphere fig s12 which indicates that the fe iv is the dominant oxidant for as iii in neutral fenton reaction fig 4b shows that excess dmso 400 mm decreased the as iii initial oxidation rate by approximately 50 from 1 22 to 0 064 μm min 1 which indicates that half of the as iii oxidation is through reaction with fe iv there must be other pathways of as iii oxidation not via fe iv whereas excess dmso did not significantly inhibit fe ii oxidation fig 4c which implies that fe ii oxidation did not occur via the fe iv pathway we thus propose that half of as iii oxidation by h2o2 occurred via the fe iv pathway eqs 14 and 15 and that the increased fe ii oxidation by h2o2 occurred through fe ii as iii as v complexes eqs 16 and 17 to testify this proposal that the increased fe ii oxidation by h2o2 occurs through fe ii as iii complexes fe ii oxidation by h2o2 with or without as v under a nitrogen atmosphere were recorded in figs s13 and s14 respectively as expected fig s13 demonstrates the negligible oxidation of 50 μm fe ii by 5 4 μm h2o2 in the absence of as iii as v and oxygen an increase in h2o2 concentration e g 1 to 10 fold that of the fe ii concentration 54 540 μm can lead to fe ii oxidation ca 10 60 therefore reactions in eqs 18 20 hardly occurred at the low concentration of h2o2 produced during co oxidation of as iii and fe ii in this work meanwhile fig s14 demonstrates that the reaction in eq 17 was very slow r fe ii 0 07 μm min 1 even for 50 μm fe ii and 5 μm as v in the presence of 5 4 μm h2o2 under a nitrogen atmosphere thus the reaction in eq 16 is responsible for most increased fe ii oxidation evidently dmso can inhibit as iii oxidation in eqs 14 and 15 by scavenging fe iv but is unable to inhibit fe ii oxidation in eq 16 or 17 these reactions mainly take place on the surface of cfh once the reactions start the final products are cfh and insoluble colloidal feaso4 in solution 14 fe ii as iii complex h2o2 fe iv as iii complex 15 fe iv as iii complex fe ii as v complex 16 fe ii as iii complex h2o2 fe iii as iii complex 17 fe ii as v complex h2o2 fe iii as v complex 18 fe ii h2o2 fe iv 19 fe iv fe ii 2fe iii 20 2fe ii h2o2 2fe iii 3 5 oxidation of as iii via reaction between fe iii as iii complexes and h2o2 to examine other pathways of as iii oxidation not via fe iv experiments were conducted to assess the effect of the fe iii as iii complex on as iii oxidation in the presence of h2o2 results in fig 5 show that as iii was oxidized by h2o2 in the presence of fe iii at a nitrogen atmosphere of course this part of as iii oxidation cannot be attributed to ho in the tba scavenging experiment fig s15 the log k value of the fe iii tiron 3 complex is 46 9 naka et al 2006 which is much higher than that of fe iii oh 3 38 55 when excess tiron was added to the solution as iii cannot form the surface complex with fe iii thus tiron was added to the reaction solution to investigate the inhibitory effect as expected as iii oxidation was completely inhibited by tiron fig 5 this reaction may contribute little to the overall as iii oxidation in the initial stage of as iii and fe ii co oxidation because both the reactants fe iii as iii complex and h2o2 are at very low concentrations however since excess dmso can only inhibit about half of as iii oxidation fig 4b the other half of as iii oxidation most likely occurred via formation of the fe iii as iii complex and then directly underwent oxidization by h2o2 eq 21 the excess dmso 400 mm cannot inhibit as iii oxidation in the presence of fe iii and h2o2 fig s16 thus the reaction in eq 21 occurred not via fe iv on the cfh surface in neutral solution 21 fe iii as iii complex h2o2 fe iii as v complex 3 6 rate constants for reactions between fe iii fe ii as iii complexes and h2o2 the ph metric titration method in the absence of oxygen as proposed by bjerrum 1941 and modified by irving and rossotti 1954 was applied in fig s17 the curves for fe ii as iii complex formation fig 6 a extend to a maximum n value ca 2 7 the values of n 0 20 n indicate that the complexes formed at least have 1 1 and 1 2 metal ligand stoichiometry however the concentration of as iii 5 μm was much less than that used in fig 6a thus only the 1 1 fe ii as iii complex was considered the formation constant of fe ii as iii complex k fe ii as iii calculated from the complex formation curves is 103 86 m 1 fig 6a at half integrals using the bjerrum s method bjerrum 1941 because the rates of as iii oxidation through the reaction between the fe ii as iii complex and h2o2 r fe ii as iii depends on the concentrations of fe ii as iii complex and h2o2 the rate of this reaction at various time is expressed as eq 22 thus k fe ii as iii was calculated to be 0 03 μm 1 min 1 shown in si 22 r fe ii as iii k fe ii as iii fe ii as iii h2o2 in fe iii solution containing h2o2 and as iii at neutral ph as iii oxidation occurs through the fe iii as iii complex as shown in eq 21 the rate is expressed in eq 23 a linear fit between the rates of as iii oxidation via the fe iii as iii complex r fe iii as iii and fe iii as iii h2o2 at various initial h2o2 is evident in fig 6b the rate constant of the reaction between fe iii as iii and h2o2 k fe iii as iii was determined to 0 03 μm 1 min 1 23 r fe iii as iii k fe iii as iii fe iii as iii h2o2 3 7 mechanism integration from the mass balance between dissolved and adsorbed as iii as v species we determined the amounts of as iii and as v adsorbed on cfh by centrifugation to separate the colloids in the samples without acidification fig 7 a shows that adsorption of either as iii or the oxidized product as v is very fast in particular few as v could be detected in the supernatant solution at each sampling time because of the very strong adsorption of as v on the cfh k fe iii as v 1022 1027 m 1 jia et al 2006 the adsorption rate for as iii was also high ca 0 015 μm min 1 about 0 32 μm as iii was adsorbed by cfh within 60 min fig 7a also suggests that dissolved fe ii became depleted quickly not only because of oxidation but also because of adsorption onto cfh which enables fe ii as iii oxidation on the surface of cfh possible the overall rates of as iii oxidation r as iii r fe ii as iii calculated by eq 22 and r fe iii as iii calculated by eq 23 at each sampling point can be compared in fig 7b the result suggests that r fe ii as iii is crucial at the initial stage of the reaction and that r fe iii as iii accounts for only less than 10 of r as iii at 5 min however the as iii oxidation through fe iii as iii complex becomes the major pathway in the middle and final stages of as iii oxidation the sum of r fe ii as iii and r fe iii as iii is approximately equal to r as iii which confirms the dependence of as iii oxidation by h2o2 on fe ii as iii and fe iii as iii complexations in fe ii solutions accordingly the proposed process of as iii and fe ii co oxidation by oxygen at neutral ph is shown in scheme 1 4 conclusion this work investigated the co oxidation of as iii and fe ii in the presence of o2 at neutral solutions and revealed the importance of complexation between fe ii fe iii and as iii as v sepcies for the co oxidation of as iii and fe ii the oxidation of the fe ii as iii complex promotes the production of h2o2 which oxidizes as iii through the fe ii fe iii as iii complexes the h2o2 reacts with the fe ii as iii complex via the intermediate fe iv which contributes to approximately half of as iii oxidation the other half of as iii oxidation by h2o2 occurs via intramolecular electrons transfer after the formation of fe iii as iii complexes the complexation between fe ii fe iii and as iii as v sepcies at neutral ph presents an overlooked mechanism of co oxidation of as iii and fe ii which supplements the fundamentals for the oxidation behaviors of as iii in natural water e g groundwater and offers the

19453,previous studies have shown that the oxidation of fe ii by molecular oxygen can lead to the co oxidation of as iii at neutral ph however the mechanism of as iii oxidation in the presence of fe ii with respect to the interaction between as iii and fe ii is still unclear in this work we examined the oxidation of as iii in the presence of fe ii in air saturated water which is affected by ph co existing phosphate and scavengers tert butanol superoxide dismutase catalase and dimethylsulfoxide results confirm that the formation of the fe ii as iii complex formation constant k fe ii as iii 103 86 m 1 plays an extremely important role in the initial stage of as iii oxidation at ph 7 25 the oxidation of fe ii as iii promotes the production of h2o2 and colloidal ferric hydroxide h2o2 reacts with the fe ii as iii complex through oxidizing fe ii to fe iv which then causes the partial oxidation ca 50 of as iii the other part of as iii oxidation by h2o2 occurs in the form of fe iii as iii complex through direct electron transfer from as iii to h2o2 but not through fe iv this work provides new mechanistic insight into arsenic and iron redox chemistry in the environment and furthers our

h2o2 ona nguema et al 2010 shao et al 2016 hug and co workers hug et al 2001 hug and leupin 2003 katsoyiannis et al 2008 suggested that although fe ii autoxidation possibly produces ros ferryl iron fe

been identified as the fenton intermediate by using ch3 2so bataineh et al 2012 pang et al 2011 ruled out fe iv as an active fenton intermediate and thought that ho and heterogeneous surface reactions were responsible for as iii oxidation in the fe 0 o2 system over a wide ph range however the possible effect of as iii on fe iv formation e g complexation and whether only fe iv is responsible for as iii oxidation during fe ii autoxidation in neutral aerated solutions have not been clarified in decades the complexation between as iii and iron hydr oxides banerjee et al 2008 manning et al 1998 as well as as iii oxidation on colloidal ferric hydroxide cfh via photoinduced ligand to metal charge transfer xu et al 2014 has been proposed however few studies have reported the complexation between as iii and fe ii possibly because of 1 the normally poor complexing property of fe ii and 2 the low stability and sensitivity to do of the fe ii as iii complex two groups demonstrated fe ii as iii complex formation at neutral ph based on extended x ray absorption fine structure exafs thoral et al 2005 found as iii inner sphere complexes on ferrous hydroxide particles formed at ph 7 which were

3 mm fe ii at ph 7 as well as provided exafs evidence for the multinuclear as iii complexes at the edges of layered fe oh 2 nanoparticles though they proposed the complexation between fe ii and as iii at high concentrations the possibility of fe ii as iii complex formation at lower concentrations of as iii and fe ii and the mechanism of co oxidation of as iii and fe ii through this complex remain unclear this work is designed to provide mechanistic insight into the co oxidation of fe ii and as iii by do in aqueous solutions at near neutral ph the specific aims are i to test the hypotheses that as iii oxidation in the presence of fe ii and oxygen occurs through the formation of an fe ii as iii complex ii to clarify the pathways of co oxidation of as iii and fe ii and iii to evaluate the relative contributions of ros fe iv and direct electron transfer from as iii to h2o2 this work may aid in understanding the co oxidation of fe ii and as iii in groundwater exposed to air and the

as v was simultaneously analyzed by liquid chromatography hydride generation atomic fluorescence spectrometry lc hg afs bohui innovation technology co ltd beijing china the fe ii concentration was measured similar to our previous work wang et al 2013 briefly the fe ii concentration was analyzed by adding the chelating agent 1 10 phenanthroline and then measuring the absorbance of the fe ii 1 10 phenanthroline 3 2 complex by spectrophotometry at 510 nm shimadzu uv 1601 japan to terminate the co oxidation of as iii and fe ii and detect the total concentrations of as and fe i e the summation of the dissolved adsorbed and precipitated forms samples were taken for analysis at certain time intervals and added quickly to colorimetric tubes containing 1 ml hcl solution 1 1 v v diluted with fresh ultrapure water to 10 ml the concentrations of dissolved as and fe were determined by centrifugation to separate the colloids in the samples without acidification the concentrations of adsorbed as and fe were obtained after subtracting dissolved as and fe concentrations from total as and fe concentrations as iii and fe ii referred to total concentrations of as iii and fe ii i e the summation of the dissolved adsorbed and precipitated forms unless noted otherwise the fe ii fe iii species distribution versus ph was simulated by medusa software the redox potentials of fe iii fe ii and as v as iii were determined by cyclic voltammogram experiments with an electrochemical workstation chi600e ch instruments ins free radicals produced during fe ii autoxidation were detected by electron spin resonance esr spectroscopy using a japan electron optics laboratory co ltd fa200 spectrometer the concentration of h2o2 was determined using dpd photometric method at a wavelength of 551 nm wang et al 2013 the formation constant of fe ii as iii complex at neutral ph was calculated using ph metric titrations method proposed by bjerrum 1941 and modified by irving and rossotti 1954 except for special description the initial reaction rate expressed as r was determined from the linear fit of the plot of concentration versus reaction time within 0 5 min the details of analytical methods have been described in si 3 results and discussion 3 1 ph effect on co oxidation of as iii and fe ii the effect of ph on the co oxidation of as iii fig s3a and fe ii fig s3b was investigated at ph 6 0 8 0 for both as iii and fe ii oxidation the apparent ph dependence of initial oxidation rates of as iii r as iii and fe ii r fe ii followed the kinetic model eq 2 shown in fig s3c which implies that r as iii and r fe ii have a potential relationship as expected correlation analysis confirmed a linear positive correlation between r as iii and r fe ii fig 1 as the ph increased from 6 to 8 with a slope r fe ii r as iii of ca 20 the slope is twice the initial concentration ratio of fe ii as iii indicating that the oxidation efficiency of as iii is stoichiometrically lower than that of fe ii as shown in fig s3c as iii accelerated fe ii oxidation rates thus we determined the correlation between the increment of the fe ii oxidation rate δr fe ii described in eq 11 and r as iii fig 1 shows a linear positive correlation between δr fe ii and r as iii with a slope of ca 4 11 δr fe ii r fe ii r fe ii 0 where r fe ii and r fe ii 0 are the initial oxidation rates of fe ii with or without as iii respectively δr fe ii is the increment of the fe ii oxidation rate after addition of as iii we simulated the species distribution of fe ii fig s4 using medusa software ignoring the potential effect of as iii millo 1985 proposed that the formation of fe oh 2 species at ph above 6 is a key step in fe ii oxidation this is reasonable with respect to the concentration limit of fe iii free ion ca 10 14 m at ph 6 10 8 m oh which depends on the solubility product constant pk sp 38 55 of fe oh 3 precursor of cfh speight 2005 the same ph threshold 6 0 was also observed in as iii oxidation to as v fig s3c therefore as iii oxidation in nature depends on fe ii oxidation although the former apparently enhances the latter to achieve significant oxidation of as iii in a more stable fe ii fe iii solution we fixed the ph at 7 25 for all succeeding experiments 3 2 role of complexation between as iii and fe ii fe iii phosphate was added to the reaction solution to investigate its effect on the co oxidation of as iii and fe ii fig 2 a shows that phosphate slightly enhanced fe ii oxidation because of the formation of relatively labile dissolved ferrous phosphate complexes at ph 6 75 johnston and singer 2007 whereas fig 2b shows that phosphate prevented almost all as iii oxidation as the phosphate concentration increased to 250 μm in fe ii solution containing 250 μm phosphate 5 fold higher than fe ii only about 32 of fe ii formed iron ii phosphate complexes fehpo4 feh2po4 or fe3 po4 2 in the absence of as iii at ph 7 25 calculated by medusa software fig s5a about 10 12 1 m fe oh 2 remained which is close to the amount obtained without phosphate fig s4 formation of fepo4 2h2o rather than cfh fig s5b also limited as iii cfh complexation since phosphate has a strong ability to complex with fe ii fe iii and a chemical behavior similar to that of as iii and as v raven et al 1998 xu et al 2014 phosphate could compete with as iii in complexation with fe ii fe iii therefore the inhibitory effect was not only due to the formation of iron ii iii phosphate or scavenging of ho radical by phosphate rate constant 107 m 1 s 1 but also probably due to the competition of complexation between phosphate and as iii with fe ii or fe iii eqs 12 and 13 as iii reacts with ho radical at a much higher reaction constant 8 5 109 m 1 s 1 xu et al 2014 thus we considered that as iii might complex with fe ii or fe iii when fe oh 2 species or cfh formed and that oxidation of as iii occurred after these complexes formed 12 fe ii as iii fe ii as iii complex 13 fe iii as iii fe iii as iii complex the chelator dp favors the binding of fe ii ions over that of fe iii ions this step forms fe dp 3 2 in solution which exhibits no ability for activating oxygen li et al 2004 thus dp was added to confirm the effect of fe ii autoxidation on as iii oxidation as shown in fig s6a and b as iii oxidation and fe ii oxidation were simultaneously and almost completely inhibited as the concentration of dp increased up to 5 fold that of fe ii this result is consistent with the work of katsoyiannis et al 2008 showing that dp interrupts reactions of fe ii with o2 and h2o2 this result is also consistent with the very low concentrations of reactive fe oh 2 species in 50 μm fe ii solution containing 250 μm dp at ph 7 25 fig s5c therefore the complex between fe ii and as iii remained the ability for activating oxygen because complexation may change the fe iii fe ii or as v as iii reduction potentials we conducted cyclic voltammetry measurements in the absence of oxygen after as iii complexation with fe ii the fe iii fe ii reduction potential decreased from 0 072 to 0 11 v vs a saturated calomel electrode sce in fig s7a this result agrees with the decrease in fe iii fe ii reduction potential due to chelators complexation with fe ii via oxygen atoms welch et al 2002 meanwhile this complexation increased the as v as iii reduction potential from 0 68 to 0 97 v vs sce fig s7b suggesting that as iii oxidation with fe ii is more difficult than that without fe ii this finding seemingly contradicts the fast as iii oxidation in the presence of fe ii thus some oxidants should be generated to overcome the higher as v as iii reduction potential 3 3 role of ros in the co oxidation of as iii and fe ii according to the results and discussions above the oxidation of as iii might occur by ros ho h2o2 o2 or other oxidizing intermediates that were formed as intermediates during the fe ii oxidation by o2 thus the presence of a scavenger could inhibit the co oxidation of as iii and fe ii by quenching ros therefore verification experiments were conducted by adding ros scavengers to inhibit the possible action of radicals tba was used as a probe compound for ho in the photooxidation of as iii through the surface complexation with nascent colloidal ferric hydroxide and its concentration 20000 fold that of as iii was enough to quench almost all ho due to the reaction constant k ho tba 3 8 7 6 108 m 1 s 1 xu et al 2014 fig s8 shows almost no inhibition of oxidation of as iii or fe ii in the presence of excess tba which is in agreement with the results of experiments using 2 propanol as ho scavenger hug and leupin 2003 in addition esr spectroscopy showed no signals of dmpo oh adduct during the co oxidation of as iii and fe ii in the presence of dmpo fig s9 these results thus confirm that ho is not the key oxidant for as iii or fe ii cat could decompose h2o2 at neutral ph with a reaction constant of 7 9 106 m 1 s 1 and was used to identify the generation of h2o2 during fe ii polyphosphate complex oxidation by o2 biaglow and kachur 1997 thus cat was added to the reaction solution to investigate the inhibitory effect significant inhibition of co oxidation of both as iii fig 3 a and fe ii fig 3b was observed with 100 500 u ml 1 cat solution as the concentration of cat was increased to 500 u ml 1 fe ii oxidation was not completely inhibited r fe ii decreased from 1 22 to 0 25 μm min 1 whereas as iii oxidation was almost all inhibited r as iii decreased from 0 069 to 0 0095 μm min 1 these results demonstrate that h2o2 is crucial to the co oxidation of as iii and fe ii in neutral solution h2o2 was the only important oxidant for as iii oxidation while molecular oxygen was also another important oxidant for fe ii oxidation the yields of h2o2 in fe ii solutions with or without as iii were analyzed along with the autoxidation reactions fig 3c shows that the initial reaction rate within 0 10 min and final concentration at 60 min of h2o2 in the presence of as iii 0 31 μm min 1 and 5 4 μm are markedly higher than those in the absence of as iii 0 14 μm min 1 and 1 7 μm this result implies that as iii acts as a ligand for fe ii thus enhancing the production of h2o2 another ros ho2 or o2 is possibly produced during autoxidation of fe ii the neutral ph causes only o2 to be the predominant species as dictated by the acid dissociation constant pk a 4 8 of ho2 o2 reaction wood 1988 sod can react with ho2 o2 with a high reaction constant of 6 1 24 108 m 1 s 1 and was used to testify the generation of o2 during fe ii polyphosphate complex oxidation by o2 biaglow and kachur 1997 thus sod was added to the reaction solution to investigate the effect of o2 on the co oxidation of as iii and fe ii fig s10 shows that the oxidation of neither as iii nor fe ii can be changed even by increasing the sod concentration up to 96 u ml 1 this suggests that free o2 plays a minor role in the production of h2o2 or oxidation of as iii and that generation of h2o2 can be based on the two electron reduction of molecular oxygen via formation of an ions complex fe3 o2 2 fe3 which is stabilized by coulombic forces and may break up to form h2o2 weiss 1953 3 4 oxidation of as iii via reaction between fe ii as iii complexes and h2o2 direct oxidation of as iii by h2o2 in the absence of fe ii is hardly possible because of the very low reaction rate constant k 5 5 10 3 m 1 s 1 wang et al 2013 unless the h2o2 concentration is high enough e g several millimolar without iron no oxidation of as iii was observed fig s11 at the maximal concentration of h2o2 5 4 μm found in the as iii solution containing fe ii in this work however when we added h2o2 at various concentrations to the deoxygenated solutions containing fe ii and as iii co oxidation of as iii and fe ii occurred as shown in fig 4 a in this case co oxidation of as iii and fe ii occurred very quickly and terminated within 5 min reaching slopes of 0 040 k as v r as iii h2o2 and 0 316 k fe iii r fe ii h2o2 respectively moreover the stoichiometries of oxidized as iii and fe ii relative to h2o2 are 0 20 k as v t 0 040 5 and 1 58 k fe iii t 0 316 5 respectively the initial rate of h2o2 reaction was 0 31 μm min 1 fig 3c thus the calculated r as iii was 0 062 μm min 1 0 20 0 31 μm min 1 which is very close to that obtained using fe ii solution containing oxygen at ph 7 25 0 069 μm min 1 in fig s3c as the production rates of h2o2 increased from 0 14 to 0 31 μm min 1 after the addition of as iii fig 3c the increased fe ii oxidation rate was calculated to be 0 27 μm min 1 1 58 0 17 μm min 1 which is also identical to the calculated δr fe ii as shown in fig 1 thus one important conclusion that can be drawn is that as iii oxidation and the enhancement of fe ii oxidation during co oxidation of as iii and fe ii are exclusively attributed to the increased production of h2o2 along with the production of h2o2 as iii oxidation in fe ii solutions at neutral ph comprises the neutral fenton oxidation of as iii since ho does not cause as iii oxidation as reconfirmed in this work the proposed reaction involving fe iv hug and leupin 2003 should be demonstrated dmso reacts with fe iv by oxygen atom transfer and yields dimethyl sulfone whereas it reacts with hydroxyl radicals and generates methyl sulfinic acid and ethane thus dmso was used to verify the existence of fe iv in fenton reaction bataineh et al 2012 and heterogeneous fe 0 o2 systems containing as iii pang et al 2011 hence dmso could be used as a scavenger for fe iv in the absence of ho in this work excess dmso 400 mm inhibited most of as iii oxidation for 50 μm fe ii and 5 μm as iii in the presence of 5 4 μm h2o2 under a nitrogen atmosphere fig s12 which indicates that the fe iv is the dominant oxidant for as iii in neutral fenton reaction fig 4b shows that excess dmso 400 mm decreased the as iii initial oxidation rate by approximately 50 from 1 22 to 0 064 μm min 1 which indicates that half of the as iii oxidation is through reaction with fe iv there must be other pathways of as iii oxidation not via fe iv whereas excess dmso did not significantly inhibit fe ii oxidation fig 4c which implies that fe ii oxidation did not occur via the fe iv pathway we thus propose that half of as iii oxidation by h2o2 occurred via the fe iv pathway eqs 14 and 15 and that the increased fe ii oxidation by h2o2 occurred through fe ii as iii as v complexes eqs 16 and 17 to testify this proposal that the increased fe ii oxidation by h2o2 occurs through fe ii as iii complexes fe ii oxidation by h2o2 with or without as v under a nitrogen atmosphere were recorded in figs s13 and s14 respectively as expected fig s13 demonstrates the negligible oxidation of 50 μm fe ii by 5 4 μm h2o2 in the absence of as iii as v and oxygen an increase in h2o2 concentration e g 1 to 10 fold that of the fe ii concentration 54 540 μm can lead to fe ii oxidation ca 10 60 therefore reactions in eqs 18 20 hardly occurred at the low concentration of h2o2 produced during co oxidation of as iii and fe ii in this work meanwhile fig s14 demonstrates that the reaction in eq 17 was very slow r fe ii 0 07 μm min 1 even for 50 μm fe ii and 5 μm as v in the presence of 5 4 μm h2o2 under a nitrogen atmosphere thus the reaction in eq 16 is responsible for most increased fe ii oxidation evidently dmso can inhibit as iii oxidation in eqs 14 and 15 by scavenging fe iv but is unable to inhibit fe ii oxidation in eq 16 or 17 these reactions mainly take place on the surface of cfh once the reactions start the final products are cfh and insoluble colloidal feaso4 in solution 14 fe ii as iii complex h2o2 fe iv as iii complex 15 fe iv as iii complex fe ii as v complex 16 fe ii as iii complex h2o2 fe iii as iii complex 17 fe ii as v complex h2o2 fe iii as v complex 18 fe ii h2o2 fe iv 19 fe iv fe ii 2fe iii 20 2fe ii h2o2 2fe iii 3 5 oxidation of as iii via reaction between fe iii as iii complexes and h2o2 to examine other pathways of as iii oxidation not via fe iv experiments were conducted to assess the effect of the fe iii as iii complex on as iii oxidation in the presence of h2o2 results in fig 5 show that as iii was oxidized by h2o2 in the presence of fe iii at a nitrogen atmosphere of course this part of as iii oxidation cannot be attributed to ho in the tba scavenging experiment fig s15 the log k value of the fe iii tiron 3 complex is 46 9 naka et al 2006 which is much higher than that of fe iii oh 3 38 55 when excess tiron was added to the solution as iii cannot form the surface complex with fe iii thus tiron was added to the reaction solution to investigate the inhibitory effect as expected as iii oxidation was completely inhibited by tiron fig 5 this reaction may contribute little to the overall as iii oxidation in the initial stage of as iii and fe ii co oxidation because both the reactants fe iii as iii complex and h2o2 are at very low concentrations however since excess dmso can only inhibit about half of as iii oxidation fig 4b the other half of as iii oxidation most likely occurred via formation of the fe iii as iii complex and then directly underwent oxidization by h2o2 eq 21 the excess dmso 400 mm cannot inhibit as iii oxidation in the presence of fe iii and h2o2 fig s16 thus the reaction in eq 21 occurred not via fe iv on the cfh surface in neutral solution 21 fe iii as iii complex h2o2 fe iii as v complex 3 6 rate constants for reactions between fe iii fe ii as iii complexes and h2o2 the ph metric titration method in the absence of oxygen as proposed by bjerrum 1941 and modified by irving and rossotti 1954 was applied in fig s17 the curves for fe ii as iii complex formation fig 6 a extend to a maximum n value ca 2 7 the values of n 0 20 n indicate that the complexes formed at least have 1 1 and 1 2 metal ligand stoichiometry however the concentration of as iii 5 μm was much less than that used in fig 6a thus only the 1 1 fe ii as iii complex was considered the formation constant of fe ii as iii complex k fe ii as iii calculated from the complex formation curves is 103 86 m 1 fig 6a at half integrals using the bjerrum s method bjerrum 1941 because the rates of as iii oxidation through the reaction between the fe ii as iii complex and h2o2 r fe ii as iii depends on the concentrations of fe ii as iii complex and h2o2 the rate of this reaction at various time is expressed as eq 22 thus k fe ii as iii was calculated to be 0 03 μm 1 min 1 shown in si 22 r fe ii as iii k fe ii as iii fe ii as iii h2o2 in fe iii solution containing h2o2 and as iii at neutral ph as iii oxidation occurs through the fe iii as iii complex as shown in eq 21 the rate is expressed in eq 23 a linear fit between the rates of as iii oxidation via the fe iii as iii complex r fe iii as iii and fe iii as iii h2o2 at various initial h2o2 is evident in fig 6b the rate constant of the reaction between fe iii as iii and h2o2 k fe iii as iii was determined to 0 03 μm 1 min 1 23 r fe iii as iii k fe iii as iii fe iii as iii h2o2 3 7 mechanism integration from the mass balance between dissolved and adsorbed as iii as v species we determined the amounts of as iii and as v adsorbed on cfh by centrifugation to separate the colloids in the samples without acidification fig 7 a shows that adsorption of either as iii or the oxidized product as v is very fast in particular few as v could be detected in the supernatant solution at each sampling time because of the very strong adsorption of as v on the cfh k fe iii as v 1022 1027 m 1 jia et al 2006 the adsorption rate for as iii was also high ca 0 015 μm min 1 about 0 32 μm as iii was adsorbed by cfh within 60 min fig 7a also suggests that dissolved fe ii became depleted quickly not only because of oxidation but also because of adsorption onto cfh which enables fe ii as iii oxidation on the surface of cfh possible the overall rates of as iii oxidation r as iii r fe ii as iii calculated by eq 22 and r fe iii as iii calculated by eq 23 at each sampling point can be compared in fig 7b the result suggests that r fe ii as iii is crucial at the initial stage of the reaction and that r fe iii as iii accounts for only less than 10 of r as iii at 5 min however the as iii oxidation through fe iii as iii complex becomes the major pathway in the middle and final stages of as iii oxidation the sum of r fe ii as iii and r fe iii as iii is approximately equal to r as iii which confirms the dependence of as iii oxidation by h2o2 on fe ii as iii and fe iii as iii complexations in fe ii solutions accordingly the proposed process of as iii and fe ii co oxidation by oxygen at neutral ph is shown in scheme 1 4 conclusion this work investigated the co oxidation of as iii and fe ii in the presence of o2 at neutral solutions and revealed the importance of complexation between fe ii fe iii and as iii as v sepcies for the co oxidation of as iii and fe ii the oxidation of the fe ii as iii complex promotes the production of h2o2 which oxidizes as iii through the fe ii fe iii as iii complexes the h2o2 reacts with the fe ii as iii complex via the intermediate fe iv which contributes to approximately half of as iii oxidation the other half of as iii oxidation by h2o2 occurs via intramolecular electrons transfer after the formation of fe iii as iii complexes the complexation between fe ii fe iii and as iii as v sepcies at neutral ph presents an overlooked mechanism of co oxidation of as iii and fe ii which supplements the fundamentals for the oxidation behaviors of as iii in natural water e g groundwater and offers the new viewpoint on neutral fenton and fenton like systems used as advanced oxidation processes for the treatment of arsenite containing water acknowledgments this work was financially supported by

19454,investments for upgrading wastewater treatment plants wwtps with tertiary treatment to reduce microcontaminant loads in surface waters at a catchment scale can be daunting these investments are highly sensitive to the selection of environmental quality standards eqss for the target microcontaminants our hypothesis is that there is a balance between eqs selection and investment that needs to be considered in decision making we used a customized microcontaminant fate and transport model coupled to an optimization algorithm to validate this hypothesis in the llobregat river basin and for the pharmaceutical compound diclofenac the algorithm optimizes the number of wwtps in this catchment requiring an upgrade to minimize the total amount of diclofenac that exceeds the eqs in every river section and the total cost we simulated and optimized 40 scenarios representing a combination of 4 potential eqss 10 30 50 and 100 ng l 1 5 levels of uncertainty bounds in the predictions of river concentrations and 2 hydrological scenarios average flows flows annually exceeding 30 of the days and environmental flows flows annually exceeding 99 of the days the results showthat there is a nonlinear relationship between the eqs and the required investment the investment increases by 100 from an eqs of 100 ng l 1 to 10 ng l 1 significantly increasing by 60 from 30 to 10 ng l 1 thus establishing an eqs of 30 ng l 1 would balance environmental protection and costs the selection of the hydrological conditions also plays a key role in the upgrade analysis because the costs for environmental flows are 50 higher than for average flows finally we highlight that the investment in research would allow the reduction of uncertainties hence allowing more qualified decisions to be made and a reduction in the wwtp upgrade costs up to 4 household 1 year 1 graphical abstract image 1 keywords wwtp upgrades eqs diclofenac priority substances catchment management cost optimization 1 introduction the presence of microcontaminants in surface waters raises environmental and human health concerns and has become a key environmental problem acuña et al 2015a to protect human health and aquatic life environmental agencies countries and territories establish environmental quality standards eqss for these contaminants the establishment of eqss for microcontaminants results from a scientific process based on ecotoxicological studies and a political process i e in the european union eu amendments to the eqs directive 2008 105 ec are negotiated in the european council and the european parliament european commission 2012 even though there are some guidelines available european commission 2011b the approaches on how to set eqs values differ among countries and territories european commission 2012 ecotox centre 2017 taking diclofenac as an example several eqss have been proposed in europe ranging from 10 ng l 1 european medicines agency 2006 to 100 ng l 1 european commission 2012 the selection of eqs should be fully consistent with the precautionary principle but the economic implications surrounding the establishment of an eqs are not fully understood investments for upgrading wastewater treatment plants wwtps from secondary biological treatment most commonly to tertiary treatment to reduce microcontaminant loads in surface waters can be daunting for the capital and operating costs hillenbrand et al 2014 estimated that the upgrade of all the german wwtps serving more than 5000 population equivalent pe would cost approximately 1 3 billion annually 3013 wwtps requiring an upgrade for a total of 82 m inhabitants in germany the swiss federal office for the environment bafu 2012 estimated that the upgrade of the required 123 wwtps would cost 1 billion in total 0 12 billion annually for a total of 8 5 m inhabitants in switzerland provisional estimates by the uk government showed that the upgrade of 1360 wwtps in england and wales would cost between 32 and 37 billion in total owen and jobling 2012 our hypothesis is that there is a balance between eqs selection and investment that needs to be considered in decision making for diclofenac the number of european river stretches exceeding a potential eqs increases exponentially as the eqs decreases from 100 ng l 1 to 10 ng l 1 johnson et al 2013 kehrein et al 2015 we expect a similar relationship between the potential eqs and the corresponding investment to avoid eqs exceedance national regional water agencies have the responsibility of allocating resources for upgrading wwtp infrastructure cost effective allocation implies optimizing resources at a catchment scale and can take advantage of models such optimization approaches have already been demonstrated in the research field as seen in bishop and grenney 1976 udias et al 2012 and saberi and niksokhan 2017 but are mostly applied to the reduction of conventional contaminants organic matter ammonia nitrate etc such an optimization assessment has never been conducted for microcontaminants a few studies evaluated and some optimized the implementation of strategies to decrease microcontaminant concentrations in rivers below the eqss however none of them conducted a proper economic assessment for instance ort et al 2009 optimized the number of wwtps but not the cost to be upgraded in switzerland to avoid any exceedance of the diclofenac eqs coppens et al 2015 prioritized the number of wwtps not optimizing or assessing the cost to be upgraded in the netherlands based on the impact of pharmaceutical emissions on drinking water and ecology gimeno et al 2017 evaluated several interventions implemented at every wwtp in a spanish catchment not optimizing or assessing the cost to avoid exceedance of the diclofenac eqs finally kehrein et al 2015 evaluated the influence of eqs selection on the number of stretches showing non compliance in the ruhr watershed germany therefore the trade off between eqs selection and costs remains unknown hence this paper aims to evaluate the relationship between the potential eqs for diclofenac and the cost of the wwtp upgrades required to avoid eqs exceedance this is done through a model based optimization of the wwtp upgrade costs for different eqss in a case study in the llobregat river basin catalonia spain ozonation is selected as the upgrading technology for the removal of microcontaminants this study also evaluates the influence of the selection of river discharges and of the model uncertainty on the optimization of the wwtp upgrade costs 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and target compound the study area is the llobregat river basin which is the second longest river in catalonia spain the main axis of the river extends 165 km from the pyrenees to the mediterranean sea draining an area of 4948 km2 and has two main tributaries the cardener and anoia rivers the hydrology of the llobregat river is characterized by a highly variable flow that is strongly influenced by seasonal rainfall the mean annual bulk precipitation is 3330 hm3 and it has an annual average bulk discharge of 693 hm3 the basin includes 56 wwtps 54 conventional activated sludge 1 aerated lagoon and 1 membrane bioreactor with pe ranging from 100 to 280 000 which collect and treat wastewater from 1 1 m inhabitants statistical institute of catalonia 2016 and discharge to the llobregat fig 1 our target compound is diclofenac a common non steroidal anti inflammatory drug diclofenac has been shown to bioaccumulate in fish and invertebrates at environmentally relevant concentrations huerta et al 2015 and to potentially exert harmful effects on non target aquatic organisms at higher concentrations acuña et al 2015b diclofenac has been included on the eu watch list of priority substances under the water framework directive directive 2013 39 eu european commission 2013 decision eu 2015 495 european commission 2015 there is no definitive eqs for diclofenac european commission 2011a so it is an appropriate compound for this study 2 2 microcontaminant fate and transport model we used the microcontaminant fate and transport mft model developed in gimeno et al 2017 to describe the fate and removal of diclofenac along the entire llobregat river basin the tool integrates 3 submodels 1 a substance human consumption and excretion model which estimates the diclofenac loads that reach the influents of wwtps 2 a wwtp model and 3 a river model each submodel has a key parameter 1 f is a lumped factor that includes the fraction of the diclofenac parent compound that is excreted to toilets discharged directly via sinks and washed off of skin or clothes 2 k wwtp is the reaction rate constant that incorporates processes by which diclofenac is degraded and 3 k river is the reaction rate constant that represents natural diclofenac degradation in rivers the model was calibrated as in gimeno et al 2017 using measurements of diclofenac in wwtp influents and effluents and in the river during september 2010 the calibrated model parameters values are shown in table 1 the output of the mft model is a calibrated probability distribution function pdf of predicted diclofenac concentrations in every river stretch in september 2010 we refer to gimeno et al 2017 for further details on the mft development and calibration the model of gimeno et al 2017 was expanded to include ozonation after secondary wastewater treatments ozonation is able to almost completely remove the diclofenac present in secondary effluents 95 99 at a low ozone dose hollender et al 2009 the estimated cost for ozone appears to be lower than other technologies such as uv and activated carbon wahlberg et al 2016 mulder et al 2015 however harmful by products are generated during ozonation so we also considered a filtration step sand filter afterwards hollender et al 2009 the percentage of diclofenac removal through ozonation and sand filtration is described by the coefficient α in equation 1 hence the diclofenac load from secondary effluent after conventional activated sludge treatment leff simulated by the mft model would be additionally removed by 100 α 100 the load of diclofenac after ozonation and sand filtration is depicted as ltert we assumed that this technology could only be installed at wwtps larger than 5000 pe 18 of 56 wwtps in the catchment installing ozonation in wwtps smaller than 5000 pe is not feasible because ozonation requires qualified permanent staff for their operation rossi et al 2013 moreover the sum of pe corresponding to the wwtps smaller than 5000 pe only represents 6 of the total pe in the llobregat basin we have set α to 99 because diclofenac removal is 99 for the ozone dose assumed in this study 0 7 g o3 g doc 1 zimmermann et al 2011 hollender et al 2009 1 l t e r t l eff 100 α 100 2 3 ozonation costs we collected the yearly costs capital and operational of 11 ozonation systems followed by sand filtration from literature mulder et al 2015 hunziker 2008 abegglen et al 2009 margot et al 2013 biebersdorf 2014 while the capital costs include investment realization and project costs the operational costs account for personnel maintenance and variable costs the variable costs include the electrical consumption for ozone generation and sand filtration and the cost of pure oxygen for the ozone production table 2 we assumed that ozone is generated from pure oxygen instead of from ambient air this is justified because almost fivefold higher ozone concentrations can be generated from pure oxygen and about half energy is consumed when ozone is generated from oxygen instead of air gottschalk et al 2010 the assumption is that the ozone dosage is 0 7 g o3 g doc 1 and the retention time in the ozonation tank is 25 min which is the lowest ozone dose considered in mulder et al 2015 to calculate the ozonation costs these ozonation operating conditions allow reaching a removal of 99 or higher of diclofenac zimmermann et al 2011 hollender et al 2009 the approach proposed in mulder et al 2015 was applied to obtain a full estimate of costs for each of these 11 systems thus we calculated the yearly investment costs assuming a lifetime of 30 years for civil works and 15 years for machinery and electrical equipment and a yearly interest rate of 4 as well applicable to spain spanish central bank 2010 for the ozonation systems which did not provide yearly capital costs we applied an increase of 65 the ratio between investment and project and realization costs from mulder et al 2015 to the investment costs to account for realization and project costs the yearly maintenance costs are calculated as 3 5 of the total investment costs as in mulder et al 2015 these calculations are included in the supporting information excel file ozonation capital costs personnel and variable costs were adjusted to the reality in spain table 2 hence accounting for spanish salaries and the price of electricity we obtained the salary of a qualified operator in wwtps from the spanish ministry of employment and social security boe 2017 we obtained the price of electricity from eurostat 2017 the price of electricity in spain in 2017 for non domestic consumers decreases as the yearly use increases 0 135 kwh 1 for a use between 20 and 500 mwh year 1 0 101 kwh 1 for a use between 500 and 2000 mwh year 1 and 0 084 for a use between 2000 and 20 000 mwh year 1 eurostat 2017 these values include an expected increase of 5 3 in the price of electricity by 2050 european commission 2016 the cost of pure oxygen also varies depending on the treatment capacity we used a cost of 0 15 kg 1 for ozonation systems that treat less than 750 m3 h 1 of wastewater prieto rodríguez et al 2013 and 0 08 kg 1 for ozonation systems that treat more than 750 m3 h 1 ried et al 2009 the calculations to obtain the variable costs are included in the supporting information excel file ozonation variable costs we highlight in green in table 2 those values that were extracted from literature and used directly in our study we highlight in blue those values that were estimated in this study the rest of the specifications in table 2 were extracted from mulder et al 2015 we obtained the cost function using the costs in table 2 and fitted them to a power function so that we can estimate the cost for any ozonation treatment size equation 2 where pe accounts for the population equivalent we included the goodness of fit of the cost values to the potential function in supporting information figure si 1 for the wwtps smaller than 11 000 pe minimum wwtp size with cost of ozonation in this study we assumed that the ozonation costs increase following the same power function as in equation 2 this was justified by the use of one single power function that fits real ozonation costs in wwtps ranging from 5000 to 1 000 000 pe as in hillenbrand et al 2014 and roccaro et al 2013 2 c o s t m 3 6 824 pe 0 344 2 4 optimization of the number of wwtp to be upgraded we used the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii deb et al 2002 implemented in matlab the mathworks inc to find the optimal set of wwtps that should be upgraded to minimize the cost and eqs exceedance accumulated in all river stretches of the catchment hence we defined two objective functions i minimization of the total yearly cost of the upgrades eq 3 and ii minimization of the total load of diclofenac exceeding eqs eq 4 3 m i n i 1 n c o s t 4 m i n i 1 m c o n c q s t r e t c h e q s q s t r e t c h where n is the number of wwtps to be upgraded with ozonation and sand filtration m is the number of stretches with eqs exceedance conc represents the predicted concentration of diclofenac in the river stretch and q stretch is the flow simulated in the stretch since there are only 18 wwtps within the llobregat river basin with more than 5000 pe we selected 18 discrete variables α to be optimized either with a value 99 reflecting that ozonation was installed after that wwtp and 99 of diclofenac was removed before being discharged to rivers or with a value 0 reflecting that ozonation was not installed in that wwtp so diclofenac is not further removed for the rest of the wwtps in the llobregat diclofenac was not further removed only the removal given by the conventional activated sludge process average value of 38 gimeno et al 2017 regarding the nsga ii parameters we selected the population size and the number of generations following a trial and error approach and ensuring that we evaluate the extreme objective function values minimum cost and maximum exceedance and maximum cost and minimum exceedance consequently the population size ranged between 200 and 300 and the number of generations ranged between 100 and 150 depending on the scenario evaluated section 2 5 the result of the optimization is the pareto front see example in supporting information figure si 2 the pareto front shows the cost of the upgrades and eqs exceedance of every solution which includes a particular set of wwtps at each generation the optimal solutions are plotted in the last generation we selected the optimal solution that minimizes the eqs exceedance the most to compare costs and the number of wwtps requiring an upgrade between scenarios we ran the optimization algorithm for each scenario as described hereafter 2 5 simulation of scenarios of an eqs under different hydrology and uncertainty levels we combined 4 different eqss 2 hydrological conditions and 5 levels of uncertainty hence in total we optimized the set of wwtps to be upgraded for 40 scenarios we ran the optimizer nsga ii for each scenario and we selected the optimal solution that minimizes the eqs exceedance the most for each level of uncertainty and hydrological scenarios we evaluated the eqs of 10 30 50 and 100 ng l 1 in surface waters proposed for diclofenac we believe that we covered very different levels of environmental protection considering a wide range of eqss in 2012 the european commission ec suggested an eqs of 100 ng l 1 for diclofenac european commission 2012 however noting that this value could be under protective the ec suggested that this value had to be reviewed later on taking into account the lowest observed effect concentrations loecs and producing other reliable studies in 2017 the swiss centre for applied ecotoxicology suggested an eqs of 50 ng l 1 ecotox centre 2017 based on the noec in fish determined by birzle 2015 in addition acuña et al 2015a suggested a value of 30 ng l 1 which corresponded to the 5th percentile of the loec for aquatic biota furthermore the european medicines agency 2006 fixed a threshold safety value of 10 ng l 1 in the environmental risk assessment era procedures for pharmaceuticals new ecotoxicity data has to be determined in the future concerning chronic effects and mixtures of chemicals and the eqs for mixtures may be preferable to deriving eqss for the individual constituent substances kienzler et al 2016 overall there is no agreement in the definition of an eqs for diclofenac as for the hydrological conditions we considered average flows those measured in september 2010 and environmental flows minimum flows in the llobregat river september 2010 is the period that was used for data collection and model calibration in gimeno et al 2017 the river flows of september 2010 correspond to the average hydrological conditions in the llobregat considering the series of daily flows measured over the last 10 years flow monitoring stations in supporting information figure si 3 the river flows of september 2010 correspond to q30 flow exceeded 30 of the days in 10 years the environmental flows were determined by the catalan water agency official journal of the government of catalonia 2006 under the principles of progressive implementation and compatibilization of environmental needs and existing uses with special attention given to safeguarding supply guarantees this environmental flow regime is defined for all bodies in the district especially for the flows in the llobregat river basin which are mainly controlled by a system of upstream reservoirs the catalan water agency is currently using the environmental flows to assess the compliance of wastewater discharges with environmental standards hence the catalan water agency suggested using the environmental flows as the minimum flows in this study the catalan water agency is also taking measures to ensure these environmental flows in their rivers even during severe droughts considering the series of daily flows measured over the last 10 years flow monitoring stations in supporting information figure si 3 the environmental flows correspond to q99 flow exceeded 99 of the days in 10 years we evaluated the scenarios of calibrated and reduced model parameters f k wwtp and k river uncertainty gimeno et al 2017 for the scenario of calibrated model parameter uncertainty we optimized the cost of the wwtp upgrades using the calibrated diclofenac concentrations in the llobregat in september 2010 for the scenario of reduced model parameter uncertainty we used the diclofenac concentrations that were simulated with reduced parameter uncertainty with respect to the calibrated uncertainty simulating the mftm with reduced parameter uncertainty i e 60 reduction with respect to the calibrated uncertainty leads to reduced uncertainty in diclofenac concentrations gimeno et al 2017 for each scenario we evaluated the highest median and lowest probable concentrations as in johnson et al 2013 the median concentrations are identical in both scenarios of uncertainty thus we evaluated 5 levels of uncertainty in diclofenac concentrations we simulated the highest probable concentrations using the 95th percentile of f and the 5th percentile of kwwtp and kriver respectively for each scenario the median probable concentrations using the 50th percentile of the 3 model parameters and the lowest probable concentrations using the 5th of f and the 95th percentile of kwwtp and kriver we assumed the same calibrated and reduced pdfs of model parameters for both hydrological conditions however we expect a higher removal of diclofenac during environmental flows because we considered lower velocities in the stretches for these low flows kunkel and radke 2012 3 results 3 1 influence of different eqss on the cost of the upgrades as expected the total annual cost of the upgrades reduces as the eqs increases and this is consistent for both hydrological scenarios fig 2 and fig 3 for the scenario average flows fig 2 we obtained a non linear relationship between eqs and the cost of the upgrades negative power relationship see goodness of fit in supporting information figure si 5 the cost to avoid eqs exceedance varied from 10 1 m year 1 14 wwtps requiring upgrade for eqs of 10 ng l 1 to 4 8 m year 1 5 wwtps requiring upgrade for eqs of 100 ng l 1 a difference of almost 6 m year 1 median values the highest decrease in costs was found between 10 ng l 1 and 30 ng l 1 from 10 1 m year 1 to 6 2 m year 1 respectively for the scenario environmental flows fig 3 the cost varied linearly from 11 1 m year 1 to 8 8 m year 1 median values for different eqs the differences in cost among eqs 30 ng l 1 and 50 ng l 1 were lower than 1 m year 1 for both hydrological scenarios approximately 0 2 m year 1 for average flows and approximately 1 m year 1 for environmental flows the sets of wwtps that are upgraded under each eqs optimization are included in the supporting information figures si 4 and si 5 3 2 influence of hydrological conditions on the cost of the upgrades higher upgrade costs would be required to avoid eqs exceedance under environmental flows compared to average flows median values while the median cost of the upgrades to comply with an eqs of 100 50 and 30 ng l 1 is lower than 6 5 m year 1 for average flows the median cost is always higher than 8 5 m year 1 for environmental flows indeed the cost increased by 84 for an eqs of 100 ng l 1 by 67 for 50 ng l 1 and by 77 for 30 ng l 1 for environmental flows compared to average flows the number of upgraded wwtps under environmental flows being more than twice the number under average flows explains those increases nearly the same optimal set of wwtps to be upgraded is obtained under both hydrological conditions if the eqs was 10 ng l 1 3 3 influence of uncertainty on the cost of the upgrades the uncertainty in diclofenac concentrations in the river resulted from simulating the model using the 5th 50th and 95th percentiles of the parameters see section 2 5 such uncertainty entails variability in the cost of the upgrades for every eqs and scenario for the calibrated uncertainty the variability in the cost ranges from 2 0 3 m year 1 for an eqs of 10 ng l 1 and environmental flows to 36 2 3 m year 1 for an eqs of 30 ng l 1 and average flows the variability in the cost is larger as the eqs decreases under the average flows scenario from 1 9 m year 1 for an eqs of 100 ng l 1 to 3 7 m year 1 for 10 ng l 1 but the opposite is observed under the environmental flows scenario from 0 8 m year 1 for 10 ng l 1 to 3 9 m year 1 for 100 ng l 1 in the scenario of average flows this is justified by an increase in the number of river stretches exceeding the lower eqs and therefore additional wwtps are likely to be upgraded conversely for environmental flows concentrations of diclofenac are exceeding the lower eqs in almost every river stretch thus nearly every wwtp should be upgraded hence explaining the lower variability in cost for the lower eqs the variability in the cost of the upgrades decreases for every eqs and scenario when the model uncertainty is reduced the variability in the cost interquartile range decreases from 23 for an eqs of 50 ng l 1 and average flows to 78 for an eqs of 100 ng l 1 and average flows most likely decision makers would use the highest probable concentrations of diclofenac highest value observed for each box plot to make a conservative decision we observe that the costs of the highest probable concentrations decrease when the model uncertainty is reduced this means that reducing uncertainty leads to a solution with decreased costs as an example for an eqs of 100 ng l 1 and average flows we obtain a reduction in the cost of the upgrades of 1 3 m year 1 if the model uncertainty is reduced surprisingly considering the calibrated uncertainty the lower probable cost of the upgrades to avoid exceedance of a more stringent eqs e g 30 ng l 1 and average flows could be much lower than the median cost required for a less stringent eqs e g 50 ng l 1 and average flows we obtained more accurate solutions and costs considering reduced uncertainty e g the lowest probable cost to avoid 30 ng l 1 exceedance and average flows is indeed higher than any probable cost to avoid 50 ng l 1 exceedance this is explained by the more accurate concentrations of diclofenac simulated using the reduced uncertainty compared to the calibrated uncertainty these accurate concentrations cause the upgrade of further wwtps to avoid 30 ng l 1 exceedance compared to 50 ng l 1 exceedance for average flows finally we observed that there is always a set of 3 wwtps rubí terrassa and sant feliu that is included in every optimal solution regardless of the eqs uncertainty and hydrological scenario supporting information figure si 6 thus an investment of 4 1 m year 1 is required in any scenario for upgrading these 3 wwtps 4 discussion 4 1 innovation of the study relationship between the eqs and the costs of the wwtp upgrades the results confirm our hypothesis that the cost of the upgrades is highly sensitive to the potential eqs from more than 10 m year 1 for an eqs of 10 ng l 1 to 5 m year 1 for an eqs of 100 ng l 1 and average flows significantly increasing for the lowest eqs the relationship between the eqs and costs becomes non linear negative power relationship supporting information figure si 7 for average flows and hence the cost of the upgrades to avoid 10 ng l 1 increases rapidly compared to 30 ng l 1 from 6 m year 1 to more than 10 m year 1 this is explained by the discrete nature of the optimization variables wwtps that are optimized can either be upgraded and removing diclofenac by an extra 99 or not in this study a small decrease in the eqs from 30 to 10 ng l 1 involves the need for upgrading a significantly higher number of wwtps from 8 to 14 the relationship between the eqs and the cost of the upgrades is useful for policy makers when establishing cost effective eqss for microcontaminants and for decision makers e g catalan water agency when proposing interventions to comply with those eqss in the derivation of an eqs given the non linearities european policy makers should consider the daunting cost of the upgrades required to avoid exceedance of the more stringent eqs i e 10 ng l 1 ort et al 2009 hillenbrand et al 2014 and kehrein et al 2015 evaluated the required interventions at the wwtps by minimizing diclofenac concentration exceedance for a single eqs of 100 ng l 1 however these studies did not evaluate the compliance with other proposed eqss nor optimize the number of the wwtp upgrades to minimize costs and eqs exceedance thus this is the first study that searches for the trade off between the cost of the upgrades and compliance with the eqs for microcontaminants 4 2 comparison to existing national strategies for the reduction of microcontaminants in rivers this section illustrates the advantages of our methodology with respect to other referenced criteria or methods first the criteria used to define the optimal number of wwtps to be upgraded with advanced treatment for the removal of microcontaminants is catchment dependent while the use of our model helps river basin authorities rba to find the optimal set of wwtp to be upgraded within any catchment this is illustrated by implementing the swiss strategy for the upgrade of wwtps bafu 2012 on the llobregat river basin the swiss strategy proposed the upgrade of every wwtp serving up to more than 80 000 residents microcontaminant load reduction wwtps serving up to more than 24 000 residents discharging into lakes drinking water protection and wwtps serving up to more than 8 000 residents that contribute to more than 10 of the dry weather stream flow low river dilution capacity this strategy was based on the modeling results from ort el al 2009 considering an eqs of 100 ng l 1 following this strategy considering environmental flows as the dry weather stream flow 8 3 m year 1 should be invested to upgrade 10 wwtps in the llobregat basin however by upgrading this set of wwtps the median concentrations of diclofenac still exceed the eqs of 100 ng l 1 in 21 river stretches the solution given by the swiss strategy seems to be risky compared to any solution that we optimized for the environmental flows for nearly the same cost we avoid 100 ng l 1 exceedance during environmental flows by upgrading 13 wwtps median values hence the upgrade of additional wwtps in the llobregat and higher costs are required to comply with the more stringent eqs and considering the uncertainty of diclofenac concentrations on the other hand lower cost 4 8 m year 1 and fewer upgraded wwtps only 5 are required to avoid exceedance of 100 ng l 1 considering the median concentrations and average flows and compared to the solution given by the swiss strategy this means that the set of 10 wwtps resulting from the swiss strategy is not the optimal solution for the llobregat river basin considering the minimization of both the cost of the upgrades and the eqs exceedance this also suggests that uniform criteria for the selection of wwtps to be upgraded across europe would not be suitable for all countries given differences in hydrological conditions treatment levels etc our methodology also helps rbas prioritize which set of wwtps should be first upgraded to avoid any eqs exceedance there is always a set of wwtps rubí terrassa and sant feliu that is included in every optimal solution regardless of the eqs uncertainty and hydrological scenario supporting information figure si 6 the effluents of these 3 wwtps discharge to river stretches with very low river dilution capacity wastewater contributing to more than 40 of the river flow this explains the very high diclofenac concentrations simulated just downstream these plants higher than 400 ng l 1 that far exceeded any eqs therefore this is the first study on prioritizing investments at wwtps for the removal of microcontaminants considering both eqs compliance and costs 4 3 framing the optimal solutions into current operational costs and european experiences the current operational cost of the wwtps discharging into the llobregat is 16 8 m year 1 catalan water agency 2017 considering that the operational cost of the upgrades personnel maintenance and variable costs represents 40 of the total required cost table 2 the current operational cost would increase from 10 considering the upgrade of 3 wwtps with a total cost of 4 1 m year 1 to 27 upgrade of 18 wwtps with a cost of 11 4 m year 1 the catalan water agency finances the required investment at the wwtps through a water tax cànon de l aigua that is included in each household water bill catalan water agency 2017 for an average water use between 108 and 188 m3 household 1 year 1 second tax block with lower water use in catalonia in 2016 the water tax was 102 household 1 year 1 and the total water bill including water supply wastewater the water tax and vat was 355 household 1 year 1 catalan water agency 2016 assuming that every household in the llobregat contributes to the payment of the wwtp upgrades the cost estimated in this study would represent an increase in the household water bill from 10 to 28 household 1 year 1 in percentages this means an increase from 10 to 28 in the water tax and an increase from 3 to 8 in the total water bill assuming that the average household s income in spain in 2017 is 40 000 household 1 year 1 oecd 2017 the cost of the upgrades ranges from 0 3 to 0 7 of the household s income the estimated average willingness to pay per household for upgrading the wwtps in switzerland 86 household 1 year 1 logar et al 2014 involves an increase by 20 in the total water bill in switzerland 430 household 1 year 1 logar et al 2014 and just 1 2 of the average household s income in 2017 66 000 household 1 year 1 oecd 2017 therefore the cost of the upgrades represents a lower percentage of the household s water bills and income compared to the estimated wtp in switzerland the cost of the upgrades in the llobregat can be compared with the cost of the upgrades estimated in switzerland 0 12 billion annually for the upgrade of 123 wwtps as estimated in logar et al 2014 and germany 1 3 billion annually for the upgrade of 3013 wwtps as in hillenbrand et al 2014 assuming that the cost is covered by every household s water bill in switzerland and germany the required upgrades would mean an increase of 37 and 40 household 1 year 1 respectively these values are larger than the 10 28 household 1 year 1 estimated for the llobregat river basin the costs in switzerland and germany might be reduced if a model based optimization using real costs would be applied finally the decrease in parameter uncertainty could lead to savings down to 1 3 m year 1 in the selection of the optimal set of wwtps to be upgraded and a reduction in the water tax up to 4 household 1 year 1 if a cost benefit analysis is carried out to support research projects aimed to reduce uncertainties in mft model parameters the reduction in the cost of the upgrades can be incorporated in the analysis as a monetary benefit 4 4 use of hydrological conditions for decision making on the removal of microcontaminants in rivers in this study we provide evidence that the cost of optimal interventions varies from 10 to 84 when using average flows or environmental flows depending on the eqs so far there is no agreement on which river flows should be used for decision making on the selection of measures to reduce microcontaminant levels at a basin scale hillenbrand et al 2014 evaluated wwtp interventions to decrease concentrations of 12 chemicals including 4 pharmaceuticals in the neckar river basin germany using the annually mean flow from 2008 to 2010 likewise kehrein et al 2015 considered the mean flow of the period 2012 2014 to evaluate measures to reduce diclofenac below eqs in the ruhr river basin germany coppens et al 2015 prioritized the investments at the wwtps to reduce concentrations of carbamazepine and ibuprofen in dutch rivers using the average flow of the driest and wettest 3 month period out of ten years 1996 2006 ort et al 2009 optimized the number of swiss wwtps to be upgraded for the removal of diclofenac for the q95 river flows flow exceeded 95 of the time annually averaged over a ten year period kumar et al 2014 evaluated the compliance of the estrogen e1 and e2 concentrations with standards in the yodo river japan for q50 and q75 in our study the environmental flows scenario is very much conservative as these conditions occur on average less than 1 of days over the year however while the use of average flows protects the environment against current scenarios of pollution the use of environmental flows would help to protect it against future scenarios of pollution in a climate change context these results show the importance of selecting the appropriate hydrological conditions when proposing the optimal strategy for the removal of microcontaminants hydrological characteristics of european rivers vary greatly and higher costs are expected for basins with low discharge such as the mediterranean basins in addition mediterranean rivers will be particularly affected by climate change as climate projections predict even lower discharges by the end of the century pascual et al 2014 4 5 recommendations for decision makers to upgrade wwtps for the removal of diclofenac this study provides an overall goal and a realistic budget to decision makers the recommendation for them would be to invest in the development of a model with low uncertainty that would then be used for decision making the investment in a research project e g 1 m as the total cost of the european industrial doctorate treatrec would be paid back in less than one year due to the reduction in the cost of the upgrades when simulating the model with reduced parameter uncertainty the costs of constructing and operating tertiary treatments are in the order of magnitude of 10 m year 1 and hence any investment to enhance the prediction capabilities of the model will result in enormous savings even in the short term we believe that adaptive management is an excellent approach to accommodating for future uncertainties and hydrological scenarios hence we would suggest not upgrading all wwtps at once but starting with the most relevant ones our study demonstrated that 3 wwtps rubi terrassa and sant feliu can be prioritized in their investment plans since they are included in every solution regardless of the eqs uncertainty and hydrological condition with regards to the trade off between the eqs and cost we found that there are no large differences in the number of wwtps requiring upgrade and the costs between 30 and 50 ng l 1 hence a good conservative solution would be to set an eqs of 30 ng l 1 which involves the upgrade of 8 wwtps and 6 3 m year 1 for average flows and the upgrade of 17 wwtps and 11 1 m year 1 for environmental flows given the power relationship between eqss and costs going lower to 10 ng l 1 would be too precautionary going higher 100 ng l 1 might endanger the freshwater ecosystem ecotox centre 2017 the model used in this study can be applied to any worldwide catchment as the matlab code and the specific data of each catchment are well separated the model uses data that is readily available from environment and health agencies and river basin authorities i e river network flows and velocities wwtp operational parameters population connected to the wwtps consumption of pharmaceuticals moreover there is no need for user s knowledge on river hydrodynamics to run the model river flows are imported from other models or from measurements at monitoring stations 4 6 limitations of this study we acknowledge that the final solution adopted by the catalan water agency must be valid for the removal of a number of representative microcontaminants in the llobregat not only for diclofenac our model is ready to simulate these microcontaminants but additional modeling efforts are needed to combine the optimal set of solutions for each microcontaminant e g adjustments in the matlab code to account for a number of microcontaminants and computational time increase this study focuses on the influence that the uncertainty in the model parameters f k wwtp and k river has on the estimates of pharmaceutical concentrations in the rivers and in turn on the eqs exceedance and ultimately on the cost of the upgrades other sources of uncertainty e g 18 of uncertainty in the ozonation costs mulder et al 2015 are not the focus of this study finally source control measures are not considered and we will address this issue in our next study 5 conclusions the cost of the wwtp upgrades decreases non linearly from 10 1 to 4 8 m year 1 for average flows and from 11 1 to 8 8 m year 1 for environmental flows as the eqs increases from 10 to 100 ng l setting 30 ng l as the eqs for diclofenac would balance costs and ecosystems protection our methodology helps river basin authorities find the optimal set of wwtps that should be upgraded for different eqss searching for the optimal set of wwtps that should be upgraded to comply with eqss of microcontaminants is a catchment specific problem establishing a uniform strategy in europe for the upgrade of wwtps seems to be challenging and suboptimal investing in research projects aimed at decreasing model parameter uncertainty leads to enormous savings in the cost of the wwtp upgrades down to 1 3 m year 1 for 1 1 m inhabitants which would have a positive effect on our annual water bill

19454,investments for upgrading wastewater treatment plants wwtps with tertiary treatment to reduce microcontaminant loads in surface waters at a catchment scale can be daunting these investments are highly sensitive to the selection of environmental quality standards eqss for the target microcontaminants our hypothesis is that there is a balance between eqs selection and investment that needs to be considered in decision making we used a customized microcontaminant fate and transport model coupled to an optimization algorithm to validate this hypothesis in the llobregat river basin and for the pharmaceutical compound diclofenac the algorithm optimizes the number of wwtps in this catchment requiring an upgrade to minimize the total amount of diclofenac that exceeds the eqs in every river section and the total cost we simulated and optimized 40 scenarios representing a combination of 4 potential eqss 10 30 50 and 100 ng l 1 5 levels of uncertainty bounds in the predictions of river concentrations and 2 hydrological scenarios average flows flows annually exceeding 30 of the days and environmental flows flows annually exceeding 99 of the days the results showthat there is a nonlinear relationship between the eqs and the required investment the investment increases by 100 from an eqs of 100 ng l 1 to 10 ng l 1 significantly increasing by 60 from 30 to 10 ng l 1 thus establishing an eqs of 30 ng l 1 would balance environmental protection and costs the selection of the hydrological conditions also plays a key role in the upgrade analysis because the costs for environmental flows are 50 higher than for average flows finally we highlight that the investment in research would allow the reduction of uncertainties hence allowing more qualified decisions to be made and a reduction in the wwtp upgrade costs up to 4 household 1 year 1 graphical abstract image 1 keywords wwtp upgrades eqs diclofenac priority substances catchment management cost optimization 1 introduction the presence of microcontaminants in surface waters raises environmental and human health concerns and has become a key environmental problem acuña et al 2015a to protect human health and aquatic life environmental agencies countries and territories establish environmental quality standards eqss for these contaminants the establishment of eqss for microcontaminants results from a scientific process based on ecotoxicological studies and a political process i e in the european union eu amendments to the eqs directive 2008 105 ec are negotiated in the european council and the european parliament european commission 2012 even though there are some guidelines available european commission 2011b the approaches on how to set eqs values differ among countries and territories european commission 2012 ecotox centre 2017 taking diclofenac as an example several eqss have been proposed in europe ranging from 10 ng l 1 european medicines agency 2006 to 100 ng l 1 european commission 2012 the selection of eqs should be fully consistent with the precautionary principle but the economic implications surrounding the establishment of an eqs are not fully understood investments for upgrading wastewater treatment plants wwtps from secondary biological treatment most commonly to tertiary treatment to reduce microcontaminant loads in surface waters can be daunting for the capital and operating costs hillenbrand et al 2014 estimated that the upgrade of all the german wwtps serving more than 5000 population equivalent pe would cost approximately 1 3 billion annually 3013 wwtps requiring an upgrade for a total of 82 m inhabitants in germany the swiss federal office for the environment bafu 2012 estimated that the upgrade of the required 123 wwtps would cost 1 billion in total 0 12 billion annually for a total of 8 5 m inhabitants in switzerland provisional estimates by the uk government showed that the upgrade of 1360 wwtps in england and wales would cost between 32 and 37 billion in total owen and jobling 2012 our hypothesis is that there is a balance between eqs selection and investment that needs to be considered in decision making for diclofenac the number of european river stretches exceeding a potential eqs increases exponentially as the eqs decreases from 100 ng l 1 to 10 ng l 1 johnson et al 2013 kehrein et al 2015 we expect a similar relationship between the potential eqs and the corresponding investment to avoid eqs exceedance national regional water agencies have the responsibility of allocating resources for upgrading wwtp infrastructure cost effective allocation implies optimizing resources at a catchment scale and can take advantage of models such optimization approaches have already been demonstrated in the research field as seen in bishop and grenney 1976 udias et al 2012 and saberi and niksokhan 2017 but are mostly applied to the reduction of conventional contaminants organic matter ammonia nitrate etc such an optimization assessment has never been conducted for microcontaminants a few studies evaluated and some optimized the implementation of strategies to decrease microcontaminant concentrations in rivers below the eqss however none of them conducted a proper economic assessment for instance ort et al 2009 optimized the number of wwtps but not the cost to be upgraded in switzerland to avoid any exceedance of the diclofenac eqs coppens et al 2015 prioritized the number of wwtps not optimizing or assessing the cost to be upgraded in the netherlands based on the impact of pharmaceutical emissions on drinking water and ecology gimeno et al 2017 evaluated several interventions implemented at every wwtp in a spanish catchment not optimizing or assessing the cost to avoid exceedance of the diclofenac eqs finally kehrein et al 2015 evaluated the influence of eqs selection on the number of stretches showing non compliance in the ruhr watershed germany therefore the trade off between eqs selection and costs remains unknown hence this paper aims to evaluate the relationship between the potential eqs for diclofenac and the cost of the wwtp upgrades required to avoid eqs exceedance this is done through a model based optimization of the wwtp upgrade costs for different eqss in a case study in the llobregat river basin catalonia spain ozonation is selected as the upgrading technology for the removal of microcontaminants this study also evaluates the influence of the selection of river discharges and of the model uncertainty on the optimization of the wwtp upgrade costs 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and target compound the study area is the llobregat river basin which is the second longest river in catalonia spain the main axis of the river extends 165 km from the pyrenees to the mediterranean sea draining an area of 4948 km2 and has two main tributaries the cardener and anoia rivers the hydrology of the llobregat river is characterized by a highly variable flow that is strongly influenced by seasonal rainfall the mean annual bulk precipitation is 3330 hm3 and it has an annual average bulk discharge of 693 hm3 the basin includes 56 wwtps 54 conventional activated sludge 1 aerated lagoon and 1 membrane bioreactor with pe ranging from 100 to 280 000 which collect and treat wastewater from 1 1 m inhabitants statistical institute of catalonia 2016 and discharge to the llobregat fig 1 our target compound is diclofenac a common non steroidal anti inflammatory drug diclofenac has been shown to bioaccumulate in fish and invertebrates at environmentally relevant concentrations huerta et al 2015 and to potentially exert harmful effects on non target aquatic organisms at higher concentrations acuña et al 2015b diclofenac has been included on the eu watch list of priority substances under the water framework directive directive 2013 39 eu european commission 2013 decision eu 2015 495 european commission 2015 there is no definitive eqs for diclofenac european commission 2011a so it is an appropriate compound for this study 2 2 microcontaminant fate and transport model we used the microcontaminant fate and transport mft model developed in gimeno et al 2017 to describe the fate and removal of diclofenac along the entire llobregat river basin the tool integrates 3 submodels 1 a substance human consumption and excretion model which estimates the diclofenac loads that reach the influents of wwtps 2 a wwtp model and 3 a river model each submodel has a key parameter 1 f is a lumped factor that includes the fraction of the diclofenac parent compound that is excreted to toilets discharged directly via sinks and washed off of skin or clothes 2 k wwtp is the reaction rate constant that incorporates processes by which diclofenac is degraded and 3 k river is the reaction rate constant that represents natural diclofenac degradation in rivers the model was calibrated as in gimeno et al 2017 using measurements of diclofenac in wwtp influents and effluents and in the river during september 2010 the calibrated model parameters values are shown in table 1 the output of the mft model is a calibrated probability distribution function pdf of predicted diclofenac concentrations in every river stretch in september 2010 we refer to gimeno et al 2017 for further details on the mft development and calibration the model of gimeno et al 2017 was expanded to include ozonation after secondary wastewater treatments ozonation is able to almost completely remove the diclofenac present in secondary effluents 95 99 at a low ozone dose hollender et al 2009 the estimated cost for ozone appears to be lower than other technologies such as uv and activated carbon wahlberg et al 2016 mulder et al 2015 however harmful by products are generated during ozonation so we also considered a filtration step sand filter afterwards hollender et al 2009 the percentage of diclofenac removal through ozonation and sand filtration is described by the coefficient α in equation 1 hence the diclofenac load from secondary effluent after conventional activated sludge treatment leff simulated by the mft model would be additionally removed by 100 α 100 the load of diclofenac after ozonation and sand filtration is depicted as ltert we assumed that this technology could only be installed at wwtps larger than 5000 pe 18 of 56 wwtps in the catchment installing ozonation in wwtps smaller than 5000 pe is not feasible because ozonation requires qualified permanent staff for their operation rossi et al 2013 moreover the sum of pe corresponding to the wwtps smaller than 5000 pe only represents 6 of the total pe in the llobregat basin we have set α to 99 because diclofenac removal is 99 for the ozone dose assumed in this study 0 7 g o3 g doc 1 zimmermann et al 2011 hollender et al 2009 1 l t e r t l eff 100 α 100 2 3 ozonation costs we collected the yearly costs capital and operational of 11 ozonation systems followed by sand filtration from literature mulder et al 2015 hunziker 2008 abegglen et al 2009 margot et al 2013 biebersdorf 2014 while the capital costs include investment realization and project costs the operational costs account for personnel maintenance and variable costs the variable costs include the electrical consumption for ozone generation and sand filtration and the cost of pure oxygen for the ozone production table 2 we assumed that ozone is generated from pure oxygen instead of from ambient air this is justified because almost fivefold higher ozone concentrations can be generated from pure oxygen and about half energy is consumed when ozone is generated from oxygen instead of air gottschalk et al 2010 the assumption is that the ozone dosage is 0 7 g o3 g doc 1 and the retention time in the ozonation tank is 25 min which is the lowest ozone dose considered in mulder et al 2015 to calculate the ozonation costs these ozonation operating conditions allow reaching a removal of 99 or higher of diclofenac zimmermann et al 2011 hollender et al 2009 the approach proposed in mulder et al 2015 was applied to obtain a full estimate of costs for each of these 11 systems thus we calculated the yearly investment costs assuming a lifetime of 30 years for civil works and 15 years for machinery and electrical equipment and a yearly interest rate of 4 as well applicable to spain spanish central bank 2010 for the ozonation systems which did not provide yearly capital costs we applied an increase of 65 the ratio between investment and project and realization costs from mulder et al 2015 to the investment costs to account for realization and project costs the yearly maintenance costs are calculated as 3 5 of the total investment costs as in mulder et al 2015 these calculations are included in the supporting information excel file ozonation capital costs personnel and variable costs were adjusted to the reality in spain table 2 hence accounting for spanish salaries and the price of electricity we obtained the salary of a qualified operator in wwtps from the spanish ministry of employment and social security boe 2017 we obtained the price of electricity from eurostat 2017 the price of electricity in spain in 2017 for non domestic consumers decreases as the yearly use increases 0 135 kwh 1 for a use between 20 and 500 mwh year 1 0 101 kwh 1 for a use between 500 and 2000 mwh year 1 and 0 084 for a use between 2000 and 20 000 mwh year 1 eurostat 2017 these values include an expected increase of 5 3 in the price of electricity by 2050 european commission 2016 the cost of pure oxygen also varies depending on the treatment capacity we used a cost of 0 15 kg 1 for ozonation systems that treat less than 750 m3 h 1 of wastewater prieto rodríguez et al 2013 and 0 08 kg 1 for ozonation systems that treat more than 750 m3 h 1 ried et al 2009 the calculations to obtain the variable costs are included in the supporting information excel file ozonation variable costs we highlight in green in table 2 those values that were extracted from literature and used directly in our study we highlight in blue those values that were estimated in this study the rest of the specifications in table 2 were extracted from mulder et al 2015 we obtained the cost function using the costs in table 2 and fitted them to a power function so that we can estimate the cost for any ozonation treatment size equation 2 where pe accounts for the population equivalent we included the goodness of fit of the cost values to the potential function in supporting information figure si 1 for the wwtps smaller than 11 000 pe minimum wwtp size with cost of ozonation in this study we assumed that the ozonation costs increase following the same power function as in equation 2 this was justified by the use of one single power function that fits real ozonation costs in wwtps ranging from 5000 to 1 000 000 pe as in hillenbrand et al 2014 and roccaro et al 2013 2 c o s t m 3 6 824 pe 0 344 2 4 optimization of the number of wwtp to be upgraded we used the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii deb et al 2002 implemented in matlab the mathworks inc to find the optimal set of wwtps that should be upgraded to minimize the cost and eqs exceedance accumulated in all river stretches of the catchment hence we defined two objective functions i minimization of the total yearly cost of the upgrades eq 3 and ii minimization of the total load of diclofenac exceeding eqs eq 4 3 m i n i 1 n c o s t 4 m i n i 1 m c o n c q s t r e t c h e q s q s t r e t c h where n is the number of wwtps to be upgraded with ozonation and sand filtration m is the number of stretches with eqs exceedance conc represents the predicted concentration of diclofenac in the river stretch and q stretch is the flow simulated in the stretch since there are only 18 wwtps within the llobregat river basin with more than 5000 pe we selected 18 discrete variables α to be optimized either with a value 99 reflecting that ozonation was installed after that wwtp and 99 of diclofenac was removed before being discharged to rivers or with a value 0 reflecting that ozonation was not installed in that wwtp so diclofenac is not further removed for the rest of the wwtps in the llobregat diclofenac was not further removed only the removal given by the conventional activated sludge process average value of 38 gimeno et al 2017 regarding the nsga ii parameters we selected the population size and the number of generations following a trial and error approach and ensuring that we evaluate the extreme objective function values minimum cost and maximum exceedance and maximum cost and minimum exceedance consequently the population size ranged between 200 and 300 and the number of generations ranged between 100 and 150 depending on the scenario evaluated section 2 5 the result of the optimization is the pareto front see example in supporting information figure si 2 the pareto front shows the cost of the upgrades and eqs exceedance of every solution which includes a particular set of wwtps at each generation the optimal solutions are plotted in the last generation we selected the optimal solution that minimizes the eqs exceedance the most to compare costs and the number of wwtps requiring an upgrade between scenarios we ran the optimization algorithm for each scenario as described hereafter 2 5 simulation of scenarios of an eqs under different hydrology and uncertainty levels we combined 4 different eqss 2 hydrological conditions and 5 levels of uncertainty hence in total we optimized the set of wwtps to be upgraded for 40 scenarios we ran the optimizer nsga ii for each scenario and we selected the optimal solution that minimizes the eqs exceedance the most for each level of uncertainty and hydrological scenarios we evaluated the eqs of 10 30 50 and 100 ng l 1 in surface waters proposed for diclofenac we believe that we covered very different levels of environmental protection considering a wide range of eqss in 2012 the european commission ec suggested an eqs of 100 ng l 1 for diclofenac european commission 2012 however noting that this value could be under protective the ec suggested that this value had to be reviewed later on taking into account the lowest observed effect concentrations loecs and producing other reliable studies in 2017 the swiss centre for applied ecotoxicology suggested an eqs of 50 ng l 1 ecotox centre 2017 based on the noec in fish determined by birzle 2015 in addition acuña et al 2015a suggested a value of 30 ng l 1 which corresponded to the 5th percentile of the loec for aquatic biota furthermore the european medicines agency 2006 fixed a threshold safety value of 10 ng l 1 in the environmental risk assessment era procedures for pharmaceuticals new ecotoxicity data has to be determined in the future concerning chronic effects and mixtures of chemicals and the eqs for mixtures may be preferable to deriving eqss for the individual constituent substances kienzler et al 2016 overall there is no agreement in the definition of an eqs for diclofenac as for the hydrological conditions we considered average flows those measured in september 2010 and environmental flows minimum flows in the llobregat river september 2010 is the period that was used for data collection and model calibration in gimeno et al 2017 the river flows of september 2010 correspond to the average hydrological conditions in the llobregat considering the series of daily flows measured over the last 10 years flow monitoring stations in supporting information figure si 3 the river flows of september 2010 correspond to q30 flow exceeded 30 of the days in 10 years the environmental flows were determined by the catalan water agency official journal of the government of catalonia 2006 under the principles of progressive implementation and compatibilization of environmental needs and existing uses with special attention given to safeguarding supply guarantees this environmental flow regime is defined for all bodies in the district especially for the flows in the llobregat river basin which are mainly controlled by a system of upstream reservoirs the catalan water agency is currently using the environmental flows to assess the compliance of wastewater discharges with environmental standards hence the catalan water agency suggested using the environmental flows as the minimum flows in this study the catalan water agency is also taking measures to ensure these environmental flows in their rivers even during severe droughts considering the series of daily flows measured over the last 10 years flow monitoring stations in supporting information figure si 3 the environmental flows correspond to q99 flow exceeded 99 of the days in 10 years we evaluated the scenarios of calibrated and reduced model parameters f k wwtp and k river uncertainty gimeno et al 2017 for the scenario of calibrated model parameter uncertainty we optimized the cost of the wwtp upgrades using the calibrated diclofenac concentrations in the llobregat in september 2010 for the scenario of reduced model parameter uncertainty we used the diclofenac concentrations that were simulated with reduced parameter uncertainty with respect to the calibrated uncertainty simulating the mftm with reduced parameter uncertainty i e 60 reduction with respect to the calibrated uncertainty leads to reduced uncertainty in diclofenac concentrations gimeno et al 2017 for each scenario we evaluated the highest median and lowest probable concentrations as in johnson et al 2013 the median concentrations are identical in both scenarios of uncertainty thus we evaluated 5 levels of uncertainty in diclofenac concentrations we simulated the highest probable concentrations using the 95th percentile of f and the 5th percentile of kwwtp and kriver respectively for each scenario the median probable concentrations using the 50th percentile of the 3 model parameters and the lowest probable concentrations using the 5th of f and the 95th percentile of kwwtp and kriver we assumed the same calibrated and reduced pdfs of model parameters for both hydrological conditions however we expect a higher removal of diclofenac during environmental flows because we considered lower velocities in the stretches for these low flows kunkel and radke 2012 3 results 3 1 influence of different eqss on the cost of the upgrades as expected the total annual cost of the upgrades reduces as the eqs increases and this is consistent for both hydrological scenarios fig 2 and fig 3 for the scenario average flows fig 2 we obtained a non linear relationship between eqs and the cost of the upgrades negative power relationship see goodness of fit in supporting information figure si 5 the cost to avoid eqs exceedance varied from 10 1 m year 1 14 wwtps requiring upgrade for eqs of 10 ng l 1 to 4 8 m year 1 5 wwtps requiring upgrade for eqs of 100 ng l 1 a difference of almost 6 m year 1 median values the highest decrease in costs was found between 10 ng l 1 and 30 ng l 1 from 10 1 m year 1 to 6 2 m year 1 respectively for the scenario environmental flows fig 3 the cost varied linearly from 11 1 m year 1 to 8 8 m year 1 median values for different eqs the differences in cost among eqs 30 ng l 1 and 50 ng l 1 were lower than 1 m year 1 for both hydrological scenarios approximately 0 2 m year 1 for average flows and approximately 1 m year 1 for environmental flows the sets of wwtps that are upgraded under each eqs optimization are included in the supporting information figures si 4 and si 5 3 2 influence of hydrological conditions on the cost of the upgrades higher upgrade costs would be required to avoid eqs exceedance under environmental flows compared to average flows median values while the median cost of the upgrades to comply with an eqs of 100 50 and 30 ng l 1 is lower than 6 5 m year 1 for average flows the median cost is always higher than 8 5 m year 1 for environmental flows indeed the cost increased by 84 for an eqs of 100 ng l 1 by 67 for 50 ng l 1 and by 77 for 30 ng l 1 for environmental flows compared to average flows the number of upgraded wwtps under environmental flows being more than twice the number under average flows explains those increases nearly the same optimal set of wwtps to be upgraded is obtained under both hydrological conditions if the eqs was 10 ng l 1 3 3 influence of uncertainty on the cost of the upgrades the uncertainty in diclofenac concentrations in the river resulted from simulating the model using the 5th 50th and 95th percentiles of the parameters see section 2 5 such uncertainty entails variability in the cost of the upgrades for every eqs and scenario for the calibrated uncertainty the variability in the cost ranges from 2 0 3 m year 1 for an eqs of 10 ng l 1 and environmental flows to 36 2 3 m year 1 for an eqs of 30 ng l 1 and average flows the variability in the cost is larger as the eqs decreases under the average flows scenario from 1 9 m year 1 for an eqs of 100 ng l 1 to 3 7 m year 1 for 10 ng l 1 but the opposite is observed under the environmental flows scenario from 0 8 m year 1 for 10 ng l 1 to 3 9 m year 1 for 100 ng l 1 in the scenario of average flows this is justified by an increase in the number of river stretches exceeding the lower eqs and therefore additional wwtps are likely to be upgraded conversely for environmental flows concentrations of diclofenac are exceeding the lower eqs in almost every river stretch thus nearly every wwtp should be upgraded hence explaining the lower variability in cost for the lower eqs the variability in the cost of the upgrades decreases for every eqs and scenario when the model uncertainty is reduced the variability in the cost interquartile range decreases from 23 for an eqs of 50 ng l 1 and average flows to 78 for an eqs of 100 ng l 1 and average flows most likely decision makers would use the highest probable concentrations of diclofenac highest value observed for each box plot to make a conservative decision we observe that the costs of the highest probable concentrations decrease when the model uncertainty is reduced this means that reducing uncertainty leads to a solution with decreased costs as an example for an eqs of 100 ng l 1 and average flows we obtain a reduction in the cost of the upgrades of 1 3 m year 1 if the model uncertainty is reduced surprisingly considering the calibrated uncertainty the lower probable cost of the upgrades to avoid exceedance of a more stringent eqs e g 30 ng l 1 and average flows could be much lower than the median cost required for a less stringent eqs e g 50 ng l 1 and average flows we obtained more accurate solutions and costs considering reduced uncertainty e g the lowest probable cost to avoid 30 ng l 1 exceedance and average flows is indeed higher than any probable cost to avoid 50 ng l 1 exceedance this is explained by the more accurate concentrations of diclofenac simulated using the reduced uncertainty compared to the calibrated uncertainty these accurate concentrations cause the upgrade of further wwtps to avoid 30 ng l 1 exceedance compared to 50 ng l 1 exceedance for average flows finally we observed that there is always a set of 3 wwtps rubí terrassa and sant feliu that is included in every optimal solution regardless of the eqs uncertainty and hydrological scenario supporting information figure si 6 thus an investment of 4 1 m year 1 is required in any scenario for upgrading these 3 wwtps 4 discussion 4 1 innovation of the study relationship between the eqs and the costs of the wwtp upgrades the results confirm our hypothesis that the cost of the upgrades is highly sensitive to the potential eqs from more than 10 m year 1 for an eqs of 10 ng l 1 to 5 m year 1 for an eqs of 100 ng l 1 and average flows significantly increasing for the lowest eqs the relationship between the eqs and costs becomes non linear negative power relationship supporting information figure si 7 for average flows and hence the cost of the upgrades to avoid 10 ng l 1 increases rapidly compared to 30 ng l 1 from 6 m year 1 to more than 10 m year 1 this is explained by the discrete nature of the optimization variables wwtps that are optimized can either be upgraded and removing diclofenac by an extra 99 or not in this study a small decrease in the eqs from 30 to 10 ng l 1 involves the need for upgrading a significantly higher number of wwtps from 8 to 14 the relationship between the eqs and the cost of the upgrades is useful for policy makers when establishing cost effective eqss for microcontaminants and for decision makers e g catalan water agency when proposing interventions to comply with those eqss in the derivation of an eqs given the non linearities european policy makers should consider the daunting cost of the upgrades required to avoid exceedance of the more stringent eqs i e 10 ng l 1 ort et al 2009 hillenbrand et al 2014 and kehrein et al 2015 evaluated the required interventions at the wwtps by minimizing diclofenac concentration exceedance for a single eqs of 100 ng l 1 however these studies did not evaluate the compliance with other proposed eqss nor optimize the number of the wwtp upgrades to minimize costs and eqs exceedance thus this is the first study that searches for the trade off between the cost of the upgrades and compliance with the eqs for microcontaminants 4 2 comparison to existing national strategies for the reduction of microcontaminants in rivers this section illustrates the advantages of our methodology with respect to other referenced criteria or methods first the criteria used to define the optimal number of wwtps to be upgraded with advanced treatment for the removal of microcontaminants is catchment dependent while the use of our model helps river basin authorities rba to find the optimal set of wwtp to be upgraded within any catchment this is illustrated by implementing the swiss strategy for the upgrade of wwtps bafu 2012 on the llobregat river basin the swiss strategy proposed the upgrade of every wwtp serving up to more than 80 000 residents microcontaminant load reduction wwtps serving up to more than 24 000 residents discharging into lakes drinking water protection and wwtps serving up to more than 8 000 residents that contribute to more than 10 of the dry weather stream flow low river dilution capacity this strategy was based on the modeling results from ort el al 2009 considering an eqs of 100 ng l 1 following this strategy considering environmental flows as the dry weather stream flow 8 3 m year 1 should be invested to upgrade 10 wwtps in the llobregat basin however by upgrading this set of wwtps the median concentrations of diclofenac still exceed the eqs of 100 ng l 1 in 21 river stretches the solution given by the swiss strategy seems to be risky compared to any solution that we optimized for the environmental flows for nearly the same cost we avoid 100 ng l 1 exceedance during environmental flows by upgrading 13 wwtps median values hence the upgrade of additional wwtps in the llobregat and higher costs are required to comply with the more stringent eqs and considering the uncertainty of diclofenac concentrations on the other hand lower cost 4 8 m year 1 and fewer upgraded wwtps only 5 are required to avoid exceedance of 100 ng l 1 considering the median concentrations and average flows and compared to the solution given by the swiss strategy this means that the set of 10 wwtps resulting from the swiss strategy is not the optimal solution for the llobregat river basin considering the minimization of both the cost of the upgrades and the eqs exceedance this also suggests that uniform criteria for the selection of wwtps to be upgraded across europe would not be suitable for all countries given differences in hydrological conditions treatment levels etc our methodology also helps rbas prioritize which set of wwtps should be first upgraded to avoid any eqs exceedance there is always a set of wwtps rubí terrassa and sant feliu that is included in every optimal solution regardless of the eqs uncertainty and hydrological scenario supporting information figure si 6 the effluents of these 3 wwtps discharge to river stretches with very low river dilution capacity wastewater contributing to more than 40 of the river flow this explains the very high diclofenac concentrations simulated just downstream these plants higher than 400 ng l 1 that far exceeded any eqs therefore this is the first study on prioritizing investments at wwtps for the removal of microcontaminants considering both eqs compliance and costs 4 3 framing the optimal solutions into current operational costs and european experiences the current operational cost of the wwtps discharging into the llobregat is 16 8 m year 1 catalan water agency 2017 considering that the operational cost of the upgrades personnel maintenance and variable costs represents 40 of the total required cost table 2 the current operational cost would increase from 10 considering the upgrade of 3 wwtps with a total cost of 4 1 m year 1 to 27 upgrade of 18 wwtps with a cost of 11 4 m year 1 the catalan water agency finances the required investment at the wwtps through a water tax cànon de l aigua that is included in each household water bill catalan water agency 2017 for an average water use between 108 and 188 m3 household 1 year 1 second tax block with lower water use in catalonia in 2016 the water tax was 102 household 1 year 1 and the total water bill including water supply wastewater the water tax and vat was 355 household 1 year 1 catalan water agency 2016 assuming that every household in the llobregat contributes to the payment of the wwtp upgrades the cost estimated in this study would represent an increase in the household water bill from 10 to 28 household 1 year 1 in percentages this means an increase from 10 to 28 in the water tax and an increase from 3 to 8 in the total water bill assuming that the average household s income in spain in 2017 is 40 000 household 1 year 1 oecd 2017 the cost of the upgrades ranges from 0 3 to 0 7 of the household s income the estimated average willingness to pay per household for upgrading the wwtps in switzerland 86 household 1 year 1 logar et al 2014 involves an increase by 20 in the total water bill in switzerland 430 household 1 year 1 logar et al 2014 and just 1 2 of the average household s income in 2017 66 000 household 1 year 1 oecd 2017 therefore the cost of the upgrades represents a lower percentage of the household s water bills and income compared to the estimated wtp in switzerland the cost of the upgrades in the llobregat can be compared with the cost of the upgrades estimated in switzerland 0 12 billion annually for the upgrade of 123 wwtps as estimated in logar et al 2014 and germany 1 3 billion annually for the upgrade of 3013 wwtps as in hillenbrand et al 2014 assuming that the cost is covered by every household s water bill in switzerland and germany the required upgrades would mean an increase of 37 and 40 household 1 year 1 respectively these values are larger than the 10 28 household 1 year 1 estimated for the llobregat river basin the costs in switzerland and germany might be reduced if a model based optimization using real costs would be applied finally the decrease in parameter uncertainty could lead to savings down to 1 3 m year 1 in the selection of the optimal set of wwtps to be upgraded and a reduction in the water tax up to 4 household 1 year 1 if a cost benefit analysis is carried out to support research projects aimed to reduce uncertainties in mft model parameters the reduction in the cost of the upgrades can be incorporated in the analysis as a monetary benefit 4 4 use of hydrological conditions for decision making on the removal of microcontaminants in rivers in this study we provide evidence that the cost of optimal interventions varies from 10 to 84 when using average flows or environmental flows depending on the eqs so far there is no agreement on which river flows should be used for decision making on the selection of measures to reduce microcontaminant levels at a basin scale hillenbrand et al 2014 evaluated wwtp interventions to decrease concentrations of 12 chemicals including 4 pharmaceuticals in the neckar river basin germany using the annually mean flow from 2008 to 2010 likewise kehrein et al 2015 considered the mean flow of the period 2012 2014 to evaluate measures to reduce diclofenac below eqs in the ruhr river basin germany coppens et al 2015 prioritized the investments at the wwtps to reduce concentrations of carbamazepine and ibuprofen in dutch rivers using the average flow of the driest and wettest 3 month period out of ten years 1996 2006 ort et al 2009 optimized the number of swiss wwtps to be upgraded for the removal of diclofenac for the q95 river flows flow exceeded 95 of the time annually averaged over a ten year period kumar et al 2014 evaluated the compliance of the estrogen e1 and e2 concentrations with standards in the yodo river japan for q50 and q75 in our study the environmental flows scenario is very much conservative as these conditions occur on average less than 1 of days over the year however while the use of average flows protects the environment against current scenarios of pollution the use of environmental flows would help to protect it against future scenarios of pollution in a climate change context these results show the importance of selecting the appropriate hydrological conditions when proposing the optimal strategy for the removal of microcontaminants hydrological characteristics of european rivers vary greatly and higher costs are expected for basins with low discharge such as the mediterranean basins in addition mediterranean rivers will be particularly affected by climate change as climate projections predict even lower discharges by the end of the century pascual et al 2014 4 5 recommendations for decision makers to upgrade wwtps for the removal of diclofenac this study provides an overall goal and a realistic budget to decision makers the recommendation for them would be to invest in the development of a model with low uncertainty that would then be used for decision making the investment in a research project e g 1 m as the total cost of the european industrial doctorate treatrec would be paid back in less than one year due to the reduction in the cost of the upgrades when simulating the model with reduced parameter uncertainty the costs of constructing and operating tertiary treatments are in the order of magnitude of 10 m year 1 and hence any investment to enhance the prediction capabilities of the model will result in enormous savings even in the short term we believe that adaptive management is an excellent approach to accommodating for future uncertainties and hydrological scenarios hence we would suggest not upgrading all wwtps at once but starting with the most relevant ones our study demonstrated that 3 wwtps rubi terrassa and sant feliu can be prioritized in their investment plans since they are included in every solution regardless of the eqs uncertainty and hydrological condition with regards to the trade off between the eqs and cost we found that there are no large differences in the number of wwtps requiring upgrade and the costs between 30 and 50 ng l 1 hence a good conservative solution would be to set an eqs of 30 ng l 1 which involves the upgrade of 8 wwtps and 6 3 m year 1 for average flows and the upgrade of 17 wwtps and 11 1 m year 1 for environmental flows given the power relationship between eqss and costs going lower to 10 ng l 1 would be too precautionary going higher 100 ng l 1 might endanger the freshwater ecosystem ecotox centre 2017 the model used in this study can be applied to any worldwide catchment as the matlab code and the specific data of each catchment are well separated the model uses data that is readily available from environment and health agencies and river basin authorities i e river network flows and velocities wwtp operational parameters population connected to the wwtps consumption of pharmaceuticals moreover there is no need for user s knowledge on river hydrodynamics to run the model river flows are imported from other models or from measurements at monitoring stations 4 6 limitations of this study we acknowledge that the final solution adopted by the catalan water agency must be valid for the removal of a number of representative microcontaminants in the llobregat not only for diclofenac our model is ready to simulate these microcontaminants but additional modeling efforts are needed to combine the optimal set of solutions for each microcontaminant e g adjustments in the matlab code to account for a number of microcontaminants and computational time increase this study focuses on the influence that the uncertainty in the model parameters f k wwtp and k river has on the estimates of pharmaceutical concentrations in the rivers and in turn on the eqs exceedance and ultimately on the cost of the upgrades other sources of uncertainty e g 18 of uncertainty in the ozonation costs mulder et al 2015 are not the focus of this study finally source control measures are not considered and we will address this issue in our next study 5 conclusions the cost of the wwtp upgrades decreases non linearly from 10 1 to 4 8 m year 1 for average flows and from 11 1 to 8 8 m year 1 for environmental flows as the eqs increases from 10 to 100 ng l setting 30 ng l as the eqs for diclofenac would balance costs and ecosystems protection our methodology helps river basin authorities find the optimal set of wwtps that should be upgraded for different eqss searching for the optimal set of wwtps that should be upgraded to comply with eqss of microcontaminants is a catchment specific problem establishing a uniform strategy in europe for the upgrade of wwtps seems to be challenging and suboptimal investing in research projects aimed at decreasing model parameter uncertainty leads to enormous savings in the cost of the wwtp upgrades down to 1 3 m year 1 for 1 1 m inhabitants which would have a positive effect on our annual water bill
