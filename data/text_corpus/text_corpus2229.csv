to overcome these limitations and an abundant literature has been and is being produced relative to alternative computational methods studies applied to a variety of climates from hyper arid to humid have demonstrated that improved methods to compute pm eto from temperature only pmt approach have appropriate accuracy these methods refer to estimating i the dew point temperature tdew from tmin or in case of humid climates from the mean temperature tmean ii rs from the temperature difference td tmax tmin and iii u2 using default global or regional values greater difficulties refer to the need for locally calibrating the radiation adjustment coefficient krs used with the rs equation therefore considering that calibrated krs values were made available by past studies for a large number of locations and diverse climates the current study developed and tested simple computational approaches relating locally calibrated krs with various observed weather variables td relative humidity rh and average u2 the equations were developed using climwat monthly full data relative to all the mediterranean countries the equations refer to all available data or to data grouped as hyper arid and arid semi arid dry and moist sub humid and humid climates to test those krs equations eto computed from temperature and using the predicted krs values were compared with eto computed with full data sets of the same mediterranean locations and of iran inner mongolia portugal and bolivia rmse average values result then small ranging from 0 34 to 0 54 mm day 1 therefore not very far from values obtained when a trial and error procedure was used for all the same locations from 0 27 to 0 46 mm day 1 these indicators allow to propose the use of krs obtained from the predictive equations instead of locally calibrated krs values which greatly eases computations and may largely favour the use of the pmt approach keywords pm eto with reduced datasets pmt dew point temperature default wind speed

studies is of main importance for computing crop and vegetation evapotranspiration and for characterizing the local climate its accurate calculation is crucial in applications to crop water management irrigation planning basins water balance climate characterization and climate change studies as recently reviewed pereira et al 2015 pereira 2017 grass reference eto was defined through a fao experts consultation smith et al 1991 by parameterizing the penman monteith equation monteith 1965 for a cool season grass so resulting in the penman monteith eto pm eto grass reference eto is defined as the rate of evapotranspiration from a hypothetical reference crop with an assumed crop height h 0 12 m a fixed daily canopy resistance rs 70 s m 1 and an albedo of 0 23 closely resembling the evapotranspiration from an extensive surface of green grass of uniform height actively growing completely shading the ground and not short of water allen et al 1998 as analysed by pereira et al 1999 this definition provides for a clear distinction relative to the penman s potential et penman 1948 and the equilibrium evaporation slatyer and mcilroy 1961 which allows assuming a well defined relationship between eto and the actual vegetation et based upon the aerodynamic and surface resistances of the reference crop and of the considered vegetation surface thus supporting the concept and use of crop coefficients the computation of eto using the fao penman monteith equation pm eto requires full data sets on maximum and minimum air temperatures tmax tmin relative humidity rh or dew point temperature tdew solar radiation rs and wind speed at 2 m height u2 however those data are often not available or data sets may be incomplete or have questionable quality thus requiring the adoption of alternative computational procedures such as those proposed in fao56 allen et al 1998 to overcome those limitations in addition very numerous alternative computational methods are dealt in an abundant literature as quoted in the literature cited below however the assumed definition implies that meteorological observations should be performed over an extensive green grass field healthy and not short of water commonly designated as reference weather station site the pm eto equation is derived from the penman monteith combination equation parameterized for the grass reference crop as referred above allen et al 1998 1 e t o 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t mean 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where eto is the daily grass reference et mm day 1 rn is the net radiation at the crop surface mj m 2 day 1 g is the soil heat flux density mj m 2 day 1 tmean is the mean daily air temperature at 2 m height c u2 is the daily wind speed at 2 m height m s 1 es is the saturation vapour pressure at 2 m height kpa ea is the actual vapour pressure at 2 m height kpa es ea or vpd is the saturation vapour pressure deficit kpa δ is the slope vapour pressure curve kpa c 1 and γ is the psychrometric constant kpa c 1 g 0 for daily computations because the daily soil heat flux beneath the grass reference surface is very small allen et al 1998 the hourly or fractions computation of eto is described by allen et al 2006 who also described the asce pm etr equation that represents alfalfa reference et while maximum and minimum temperature tmax and tmin ºc are commonly observed worldwide the other required weather variables are often not available with good quality and their acquisition may be quite expensive to cope with conditions of reduced data sets methods were proposed by allen et al 1998 for estimation of the missing variables rs ea and or u2 overall these methods consist of the so called penman monteith temperature approach pmt when relative humidity data or psychrometric observations are missing allen et al 1998 recommended computing ea assuming that the dew point temperature tdew ºc could be acceptably estimated by tmin thus resulting that actual vapour pressure is estimated as 2 e a e o t dew 0 611 exp 17 27 t min t min 237 3 this approach holds when applied to a reference site since the pm eto definition implies the consideration of an extensive and actively growing grass crop completely shading the ground and not short of water moreover allen 1996 allen et al 1998 and temesgen et al 1999 have shown that this approach eq 2 does not hold when observations are performed in non reference sites i e when weather observations are affected by aridity and or local advection which cause that tmin tdew kimball et al 1997 observed that i tmin exceeds tdew in arid sites leading to average daily differences of 0 8 to 1 2 kpa between ea computed from tmin and tdew ii in sites with semi arid climate there is seasonality in the differences between tmin and tdew resulting in differences between respective ea values varying from 0 1 to 0 6 kpa for winter and summer months respectively iii smaller differences between tmin and tdew occurred in other less arid climates e g humid continental and humid subtropical conditions with average daily differences of less than 0 3 kpa between ea computed from tmin and tdew in addition in humid locations tdew often remains above tmin resulting that eq 2 does not apply adequately numerous applications assuming tdew tmin are reported in literature applications described by liu and pereira 2001 pereira et al 2003 popova et al 2006 jabloun and sahli 2008 and córdoba et al 2015 were likely performed for reference sites the study by cai et al 2007 reported good results of using eq 2 except for a site located in a hyper arid region nevertheless the majority of worldwide weather data are likely reported from non reference sites and the adoption of tdew tmin may then cause less accuracy of eto estimates in addition data quality may play a main role in the accuracy of eto estimates allen et al 2011 the need for temperature correction was discussed by various authors particularly in fao56 allen et al 1998 thus doing tdew tmin at often proposing a correction factor at 2 or 3 c the software proposed by annandale et al 2002 took this requirement into consideration and left to the users the selection of that correction factor recently upreti and ojha 2017 adopted seasonal correction factors varying from 0 c during the wet season to 3 c during the summer months alternative computations have been proposed such as the equation developed by hubbard et al 2003 where tdew is computed from tmin tmean and the temperature difference td tmax tmin differently lobit et al 2018a computed vpd using eq 2 but adopted different parameterizations when the site was considered humid or dry in an application to the climwat data base referring to 555 stations in the mediterranean countries todorovic et al 2013 found that the correction factor at should vary with the site aridity index ai unep 1997 ratio between the long term averages of the annual precipitation and the annual potential climatic et pet thornthwaite 1948 thus at depends on the aridity of the site being larger for hyper arid locations and null for moist sub humid sites differently from more common approaches todorovic et al 2013 also proposed to compute tdew from tmean using a correction factor ad ºc for the humid sites where daily tdew is expected to be above tmin thus tdew tmean ad this approach was confirmed in applications to iran raziei and pereira 2013a inner mongolia ren et al 2016a and the azores islands paredes et al 2018a with the purpose of computing the pm eto equation in absence of radiation and or sunshine duration data allen 1997 and allen et al 1998 proposed to estimate rs using the predictive rs equation of hargreaves and samani 1982 1985 herein referred hs rs which expresses rs as a linear function of the square root of td tmax tmin 3 r s k r s t max t min 0 5 r a where krs is an empirical radiation adjustment coefficient c 0 5 and ra is the extraterrestrial radiation mj m2 day 1 this eq 3 is part of the hargreaves and samani equation hs eto which may be written as 4a e t o 0 0135 λ k r s t max t min 0 5 r a t m e a n 17 8 or as 4b e t o c hs t max t min 0 5 r a t mean 17 8 where tmean is mean daily air temperature c λ is the latent heat of vaporization commonly assumed equal to 2 45 mj kg 1 0 0135 is a factor for conversion of units from the american to the international system and 17 8 is an empirical parameter proposed by hargreaves et al 1985 when written with a hargreaves coefficient chs 0 0135 λ k r s as per eq 4b the hs eto equation is not directly expressed as influenced by the radiation adjustment coefficient krs however calibrating chs also indirectly calibrates krs following the recommendation by allen et al 1998 eq 4 is commonly used as alternative to pm eto eq 1 when only reduced data sets are available numerous studies focused on both equations 3 and 4 particularly on the accuracy of eq 3 i e the solar energy term of eq 4 comparatively with other rs estimation equations despite many authors keep using the default krs values 0 16 and 0 19 c 0 5 for respectively inland and coastal sites allen et al 1998 a great deal of research has provided for more accurate estimation of krs directly or through estimating chs for a variety of environments this coefficient krs relates with the atmospheric conditions that influence the availability of incoming solar radiation at crop and natural surfaces so the availability of energy for evaporation allen 1997 suggested estimating krs as a function of elevation to account for the effect of the thickness of the atmosphere on the volumetric heat capacity of the atmosphere thus making 5 krs kro pz po 0 5 where pz and po are the mean atmospheric pressure kpa at the site and at the sea level respectively and kro is the original value of krs 0 16 or 0 17 c 0 5 after samani 2000 later with the same purpose of taking account for effects of reduced atmospheric thickness on rs annandale et al 2002 made krs directly dependent of the elevation z m of the site 6 krs kro 1 2 7 10 5 z samani 2000 to ease the use of eq 4 without requiring local calibration of krs adopted a polynomial relationship with the long term average temperature difference tdavg ºc characterizing the site since it may be considered as an indicator of the energy available at the site 7 krs 0 00185 tdavg 2 0 0433 tdavg 0 4023 similarly mendicino and senatore 2013 developed polynomial relationships with tdavg to predict chs for various regions of italy differently vanderlinden et al 2004 proposed a linear estimator of chs using the ratio of daily averages tavg tdavg as predictor adapting this approach thepadia and martinez 2012 developed a linear krs prediction equation using data of humid sites 8 krs a tavg tdavg b later martí et al 2015 assessed various polynomial equations to estimate the chs from various weather and geographical site characteristics in eastern spain the hs rs models where krs is replaced by a predictive equation as those described above are often named after the respective authors however the radiation prediction model is the same the hs rs model eq 3 and what changes is the parameterization of krs that way of renaming the hs rs model due to differences in parameterization results confuse users as the varied nomenclature and terminology used is also confusing various models to estimate rs from temperature were developed in addition to that of eq 3 they have been the object of diverse comparative studies however these studies do not provide for a definitive ranking of models on the one hand model results depend upon the way how they were parameterized and on the other hand the ranking depends on the selected goodness of fit indicators and on the objectives of modelling e g energy assessments et estimation or crop yield predictions rankings obtained from comparative studies result therefore difficult to interpret an early study applied to argentina meza and varas 2000 shows a slight advantage of hs rs over the bc rs model of bristow and campbell 1984 chen et al 2004 considered negatively the hs rs model and developed a logarithmic td equation for replacing hs rs in china a study applied to central europe trnka et al 2007 compared various rs models in terms of their impacts on the performance of crop yield models and has shown that simple td models ranked below various models that used other variables in addition to td comparative studies by abraha and savage 2008 applied to selected weather stations across the world have shown that the hs rs model ranked high among various models including first ranked in some cases a study applied to selected chinese stations liu et al 2009 has shown that hs rs ranked high but preference was assigned to the bc rs model due to its accuracy and because parameters could be estimated from weather variables so not requiring calibration using observation data that same bc rs model was also reported with high ranking in a comparative study relative to four countries in four continents moradi et al 2014 but with two different versions of hs rs showing good performances almorox et al 2011 applied various rs models to several locations in central spain and found that hs rs performed best however authors developed a new model where a saturated vapour pressure es term was used in addition to td later almorox et al 2013 reported that performances of two versions of the hs rs equation were similar to that of bc rs in a study performed in mexico quej et al 2017 the best ranking was for bc rs but hs rs ranked high contrasting in a later study applied to mexico lobit et al 2018b none of those models was considered satisfactorily and a new model was developed modified from bc rs also using td in a study applied to usa woli and paz 2011 comparing 16 rs models a modified version of the hs rs equation ranked in the mid of the list while higher performances were assigned to models that in addition to td included daily rainfall as predictor a model comparison performed for a set of iranian stations jahani et al 2017 has shown that hs rs models performed well mainly when elevation was considered eq 6 however they ranked below various purposefully developed td polynomial equations however of local interest only the performance of various forms of hs rs models were also good but not the best as reported for other studies in iran besharat et al 2013 and canada aladenola and madramootoo 2014 summarizing the comparative studies of rs prediction models do not provide for a clear ranking of models because they are conceptually different and are applied to a variety of sites having diverse environmental conditions different data availability and diverse modelling objectives various comparisons did not focus et applications but local or regional solar energy studies therefore having requirements different of those where rs is used to compute eto studies have shown that higher prediction performances require somewhat complex parameterization so contradicting the simplicity of the original hs rs eq 3 that simplicity was a main reason why hs rs was proposed to compute the pm eto when only reduced data sets are available allen et al 1998 the referred studies also show that despite the hs rs eq 3 may not be the best estimator of rs it certainly is highly valuable to provide for computing eto when solar radiation or sunshine duration are not observed numerous applications have demonstrated the appropriateness of the hs rs model for estimating rs for pm eto computations with reduced data sets among the first results are those for china by liu and pereira 2001 and pereira et al 2003 for bulgaria popova et al 2006 and for tunisia jabloun and sahli 2008 these studies used simple tests to get the best krs values which varied in a limited range the recommendation by allen 1997 to adopt self calibration had no followers because it is quite demanding bandyopadhyay et al 2008 used also a demanding calibration procedure with back estimation of rs to estimate the krs coefficients for a large set of weather stations in india trial and error procedures for the calibration of krs were later used by todorovic et al 2013 raziei and pereira 2013a ren al 2016a and paredes et al 2018a which aimed at minimizing the differences between pm eto computed with full data or with rs estimated with hs rs the available studies allow to understand that krs varies spatially not only with site elevation but also with the distance to large water bodies as earlier discussed by hargreaves and samani 1982 1985 allen 1997 and hargreaves and allen 2003 the effect of the proximity to large water bodies particularly the sea may refer to the peculiar behaviour of both wind and air moisture in coastal areas which were supposed to increase krs relative to inland areas in addition recent studies raziei and pereira 2013a ren et al 2016a paredes et al 2018a reported that krs increases with the aridity of the site and with wind speed reduced data sets often do not include wind speed data under these circumstances allen et al 1998 proposed the use of the world average wind speed value u2 2 m s 1 as the default estimator of wind speed when related data are missing when average local or regional wind speed data are available they could be used alternatively following results reported by popova et al 2006 jabloun and sahli 2008 and paredes et al 2018a nevertheless as discussed by allen et al 1998 impacts of wind speed are generally not large except for areas where aridity dominates the use of the above referred approaches for estimating the parameters of the pm eto equation allows computing eto just replacing rs ea or u2 by their respective estimators when related weather variables are missing or using temperature data only when more variables are lacking the above quoted bibliography includes adequate examples of computing eto with the pmt approach considering the discussion above on procedures to compute rs ea and u2 with reduced data sets and observing that there is a limited use of those computational procedures despite various studies show that related calculations are often accurately performed the objectives of this study consist of a revising the use of available procedures for estimating tdew from temperature wind speed from local or default values and solar radiation from the temperature difference b developing multiple regression equations for the empirical radiation adjustment coefficient krs to be used in assessing rs from temperature and c testing such equations for various regions and climates as a contribution to define a consolidated method for computing the pm eto from temperature when only reduced datasets are available 2 materials and methods 2 1 data various data sets consisting of daily and monthly weather data were used in the present study main data are from the climwat database smith 1993 which version 2 0 consists of observed long term monthly mean climatic data from over 5000 meteorological stations worldwide the weather data include monthly mean data for maximum and minimum temperature tmax and tmin ºc solar radiation rs mj m 2 day 1 mean relative humidity rh and wind speed u2 km day 1 in addition the database also includes monthly mean data on total and effective precipitation p and pe mm and on monthly mean daily grass reference evapotranspiration eto mm day 1 computed with the pm eto equation eq 1 the climwat database has been used in several evapotranspiration studies namely those reported by allen 1996 1997 temesgen et al 1999 and droogers and allen 2002 data used in this study are about the same as previously used by todorovic et al 2013 and refer to the mediterranean countries with a total number of 588 weather stations fig 1 hereafter called med climwat all stations are distributed into six climate zones defined according to the unep aridity index ai unep 1997 with ai consisting of the ratio between the long term mean of annual precipitation p mm and annual potential climatic evapotranspiration petth mm thornthwaite 1948 the distribution of weather stations into the various ai climate zones is represented in fig 1 the respective spatial distribution shows that most humid and sub humid climates are located in the northern mediterranean countries semiarid climates mostly occur nearby the mediterranean sea while arid and hyper arid climates dominate in the southern mediterranean countries fig 1 also shows that a good number of stations are located by the coast overall the selected weather stations are well distributed throughout the mediterranean region and refer to a large spectrum of environmental conditions as summarized in table 2 where ranges of eto and elevation are presented in relation to the various climate zones krs values of the selected mediterranean stations range from 0 11 to 0 28 c

duration n hour and wind speed u2 m s 1 relative to 37 iranian synoptic stations the majority of the selected stations had nearly complete data records for the period 1971 2005 their data passed careful quality control by the iranian meteorological organization and were further analysed by the authors of the study for possible non homogeneities resulting that the wind datasets at 7 stations were corrected against neighbouring stations following the proposed approaches by allen et al 1998 the distribution of the selected stations in terms of climate zones defined by the aridity index ai unep 1997 is summarized in table 1 ai varies from humid and sub humid near the caspian sea in north eastern iran dry sub humid and semi arid in the northern and western regions to arid and hyper arid in central and southern iran the ranges of eto and elevation are given in table 2 in relation to the referred climate zones a spatial analysis relative to the weather variables used to compute eto and of eto itself as well as relative to their seasonality is reported by raziei and pereira 2013b the krs values used in the current study ranged from 0 11 to 0 21 c 0 5 with larger values generally assigned to arid and hyper arid sites raziei and pereira 2013a data of inner mongolia used herein refer to those adopted in the study reported by ren et al 2016a they consist of monthly precipitation

and have been submitted to quality control previously to be used the selected weather stations are well distributed throughout inner mongolia the aridity index ai varies from moist sub humid in the east to hyper arid in the west coherently eto increases from the eastern to the western inner mongolia the distribution of weather stations per climate zone is shown in table 1 while the ranges of eto

analysis of weather variables and eto including when computed by the pmt approach are presented by ren et al 2016b daily data relative to 4 weather stations in the bolivian altiplano chipana et al

classified as dry sub humid climates table 1 the range of eto is given in table 2 krs varied from 0 13 to 0 14 c 0 5 daily weather data of portugal consisted of two datasets relative to the azores archipelago and to continental portugal the azores dataset used in the present study refer to 19 weather stations located in eight islands paredes et al 2018a b data included precipitation mm tmax and tmin c rh u2 m s 1 and solar radiation rs w m 2 or sunshine duration n hour all data were collected above green grass daily data refers to periods whose lengths varied between 283 and 5478 days a data quality control was performed according to recommendations by allen et al 1998 the yearly average precipitation varies with longitude from 730 mm year 1 in santa maria the east most island to 1666 mm year 1 in flores the west most island the weather variables largely vary within the months throughout the year air humidity is generally high with median rh close to 80 the dominant winds are from sw with high moisture winds are often strong mainly in winter and show a great variability within months the variability of solar radiation is high due to effects of variable cloudiness eto is greater in summer months and does not change much from an island to another for all stations ai ranged from 2 0 to 8 6 thus indicating that a humid climate prevails in all islands however krs varied in a large range from 0 14 to 0 24 c 0 5 paredes et al 2018a the dataset relative to continental portugal consists of 37 weather stations 27 from the portuguese meteorological institute ipma and 10 from the irrigation operative center cotr and refer to periods of various lengths from 2004 to 13 111 days most of these stations were used in a study on application of era interim reanalysis data to compute eto paredes et al 2018c data refers to precipitation mm tmax and tmin oc rh u2 m s 1 and rs mj m 2 day 1 or n hour the quality of observed data was previously assessed using the techniques described in fao56 allen et al 1998 the distribution of weather stations per climate zone is also shown in table 1 ranges of eto and station elevations are summarized in table 2 krs ranged from 0 11 to 0 26 c 0 5 2 2 computation of eto with full data sets when full weather data sets were available the pm eto eq 1 was computed using the standard methods described in fao56 allen et al 1998 eq 1 was used as standard for assessing the performance of the alternative approaches used to compute eto with reduced data sets the saturation vapour pressure es kpa was computed from observed tmax and tmin as 9 e s

and rhmin ea was computed as 12 e a e o t min r h max 100 e o t max r h min 100 2 thus taking into consideration tmax and tmin for increased accuracy allen et al 1998 net radiation rn was computed as the algebraic sum of the net short wave radiation rns and the net long wave radiation rnl with all radiation units expressed in mj m 2 day 1 13 r n r ns r nl rns represents the balance between incoming and reflected solar radiation 14 r ns 1 α r s where rs is the incoming solar radiation and α is the albedo or canopy reflection coefficient fixed to 0 23 as for the definition of the grass reference crop when rs was not measured it was calculated from the observed duration of sunshine hours with the angström 1924 equation 15 r s a s b s n n r a where n is the actual daily duration of

as a function of the day in the year and the latitude of the site the default values as 0 25 and bs 0 50 recommended by allen et al 1998 were used except for the high elevation sites in the bolivian altiplano where calibrated values were adopted chipana et al 2010 net long wave radiation rnl resulting from the balance between the outgoing long wave radiation emitted by the vegetation and the soil

calculations g was computed as 20 gmonth i 0 07 tmonth i 1 tmonth i 1 thus from the temperatures of the following and past months i 1 and i 1 allen et al 1998 to adjust wind speed data uz obtained by

pmt approach the need to correct tmin to accurately estimating tdew in arid areas was early well identified following the studies by todorovic et al 2013 raziei and pereira 2013a ren et al 2016a and

measurements was performed using the default value of u2 2 m s 1 this was the only viable procedure considering the variety of data used belonging to diverse databases the use of estimated local values revealed not possible nevertheless former studies confirmed that for areas where climate is mild the impact of wind speed on eto is quite limited differently for arid and windy sites the use of under estimated u2 values e g adopting the referred default value may lead to underestimation of the computed eto however the number of these situations was very reduced in the datasets used in the current study when radiation or sunshine duration measurements are not available the pmt method estimates the incoming solar radiation from the hs rs eq 3 as discussed before that discussion has shown that the hs rs method may not be the best but it is certainly appropriate to compute rs in absence of observations of radiation or sunshine duration when aiming at estimating eto in the current study the krs values in eq 3 were computed for every site using a trial and error procedure for searching the krs value that minimizes the difference between eto computed with full data sets pm eto and with the pmt approach eto pmt when adopting the tdew and u2 estimation procedures described above considering the studies by samani 2000 thepadia and martinez 2012 mendicino and senatore 2013 and martí et al 2015 among others all the computed krs relative to the med climwat dataset were used in a regression analysis to assess their relationships with various climatic and geographical variables characteristics of the respective sites the variables used as predictors include averages of td tmean the ratio tmean td u2 rh as well as the aridity index ai and the elevation z m which characterize each site regressions were performed either considering those variables alone or in combination with one or two others all possible single and multiple linear regressions between locally calibrated krs and those predictors were tested and the regression equations were compared based on several statistical indicators including the multiple coefficient of correlation the coefficient of determination r2 the adjusted r2 the f values in the goodness of fit tests and their significance p values in addition for each predictor the regression coefficient the standard error the confidence interval and the p value of the zero null hypothesis were analysed the multiple regression equations were developed for all med climwat sites together and after analyzing their statistical indicators one equation was selected using the same predictors multiple regression equations were also developed for the stations grouped by aridity index into four groups relative to the sites classified as hyper arid and arid semi arid dry and moist sub humid and humid the regression equations were developed with data relative to 555 weather stations from the med climwat data set 33 outliers were identified and consequently excluded using their common definition tukey 1977 any data point more than 1 5 interquartile ranges below the first quartile or above the third quartile the selected global and ai grouped multiple regression equations were tested with data relative to all datasets described before thus for a total of 699 sites 2 4 accuracy indicators the accuracy of various eto pmt computation approaches was assessed by comparing eto pmt results with pm eto computed for the same sites with this purpose several statistical indicators were used 1 the regression coefficient b0 of the regression forced to the origin fto eisenhauer 2003 between pm eto computed with full data sets oi x and eto pmt computed with the pmt approach pi y a value of b0 1 0 indicates that the fitted line is y x thus oi and pi are similar a value of b0 1 0 suggests overestimation and b0 1 0 underestimation 2 the determination coefficient r2 of the ordinary least squares ols regression between oi and pi where a r2 close to 1 0 indicates that most of the variation of the observed values is explained by the estimation approach used however a high value of r2 is in itself insufficient to state that there is good overall agreement between observed and estimated values 3 the root mean square error rmse which measures the overall differences between observed oi and predicted pi values 27 rmse i 1 n p i o i 2 n 0 5 which should be as small as possible it has the same units of the variable under analysis 4 the nash and sutcliffe 1970 modelling efficiency ef non dimensional that provides an indication of the relative magnitude of the mean square error mse rmse2 relative to the observed data variance 28 ef 1 0 i 1 m o i p i 2 i 1 m o i o 2 the maximum value ef 1 0 can only be achieved if there is a perfect match between all observed oi and predicted pi values thus when rmse 0 r2 1 0 and b0 1 the closer the values of ef are to 1 0 the better estimators of pm eto are the eto pmt values as discussed by legates and mccabe jr 1999 negative values of ef indicate that mse is larger than the observed data variance meaning that the estimation approach is less appropriate for the intended prediction 3 results and discussion 3 1 relating the radiation adjustment coefficient krs with site weather variables the use of pmt was revised for all datasets the accuracy indicators relative to eto pmt when the radiation coefficient krs was estimated by trial and error applied to each location are given in table 3 the regression coefficient b0 varies little around its target value 1 0 and does not show tendency for over or under estimation moreover it is associated with very high r2 which indicates that most of the variation of the observed values is explained by the pmt approach used the rmse are quite small with averages varying from 0 27 mm day 1 in case of humid climates to 0 46 mm day 1 for arid climates all ef values are high thus indicating that mean square errors are much lower than the variance of observations these results particularly rmse compare favourably with those in literature e g studies recently performed by ren et al 2016a almorox et al 2018 and paredes et al 2018b as well as when assessing the accuracy of eto computation using reanalysis weather data martins et al 2017 paredes et al 2018c the good accuracy results in table 3 are certainly related with the accuracy of estimating krs using a trial and error procedure for every site these conditions favour to assess the relationships between krs and main climate variables observed which may influence its value as referred before the considered variables are tdavg c the long term average of the temperature differences tmax tmin tavg c the long term average of the mean air temperatures tmean t td avg c the long term average of the ratios tmean tmax tmin u2 avg m s 1 the long term average of the wind speed at 2 m height rhavg the long term average of rhmean the aridity index ai eq 22 the site elevation z m the linear regression equations relating krs with the above defined variables were developed for all sites of the med climwat dataset considering the predictor variables isolated paired and grouped by 3 as presented in table 4 results are presented in a decreasing order of the statistical indicators characterizing each regression for the three cases relative to the number of predictors statistical indicators show that best results were achieved when considering three predictors when only one predictor is considered the best indicators are t td avg tdavg and u2 avg the first two could be expected considering the common eqs 7 and 8 contrarily to expected eqs 5 and 6 elevation has quite low effects on the prediction when two variables are considered together the best statistical indicators refer to the pairs tdavg u2 avg and tdavg rhavg these results confirm the importance of wind speed already identified when single variables were considered and introduce the relative humidity as a variable influencing krs the best results table 4 were for a combination of three variables tdavg u2 avg and rhavg which were already identified as best predictors when just one or two variables were considered statistical indicators of the linear regression ranked first are definitely better than those of the second ranked equation which had in common two of the considered variables particularly important is the fact that the first ranked equation has an adjusted r2 of 0 69 vs an adjusted r2 of 0 56 of the second one in other words the equation krs f tdavg u2 avg rhavg is able to explain 69 of the variance of krs while the second one krs f t td avg u2 avg rhavg explains only 56 of the same variance that first equation was therefore selected and writes as follows 29 k rs 0 365 0 010 t d avg 0 019 u 2 avg 0 002 r h avg with all 3 variables being long term averages as defined before that eq 29 refers to a wide panoply of climates with ai ranging from 0 in various desert sites in libya and egypt to 3 1 in a humid site of turkey therefore the med climwat sites were grouped into four climate zones and krs equations relative to the same predictors were developed for those climatic zones resulting in the following equations a humid climate ai 1 0 30a k rs 0 519 0 010 t d avg 0 019 u 2 avg 0 003 r h avg b moist and dry sub humid climates 0 50 ai 1 0 30b k rs 0 396 0 011 t d avg 0 019 u 2 avg 0 002 r h avg c semi arid climates 0 20 ai 0 50 30c k rs 0 388 0 010 t d avg 0 022 u 2 avg 0 002 r h avg d arid and hyper arid climates ai 0 20 30d k rs 0 217 0 004 t d avg 0 035 u 2 avg 0 001 r h avg the statistical results relative to all 5 equations the global one 29 and those relative to the climate zones 30a through 30d are presented in table 5 results show a strong linear relationship between the dependent variable krs and the independent variables tdavg u2 avg rhavg with multiple coefficient of correlation values higher than 0 83 r2 0 70 and adjusted r2 above 0 69 these indicators show that most of the variance of krs is explained by the linear multiple regression equations particularly when sites were grouped by climate zone this could be expected because grouping the sites according to their climate features reduces the variability of the climate variables influencing the computation of krs in addition the overall goodness of fit f test gives p values close to zero so rejecting the null hypothesis likewise the p values for the regression coefficient tests for all variables are almost null moreover the confidence intervals for the regression coefficients do not include the null value thus assuring that the contribution of the associated predictors are statistically significant the good results obtained in terms of statistical indicators may be explained by the combined role that the selected variables may play in terms of influencing krs values tdavg has a negative regression coefficient which may refer to the fact that when tdavg is high more energy is lost as long wave radiation see eq 16 through 19 the wind speed average is likely associated with clearness of the atmosphere at the site which depends upon the wind transport of air moisture away this fact was noticed when earlier studies defined a larger krs for coastal areas where wind is often higher than inland allen 1997 allen et al 1998 as well as in studies by raziei and pereira 2013a ren et al 2016a and paredes et al 2018a finally considering that rhavg has a negative regression coefficient that variable may represent the influence of cloudiness and air moisture which is in agreement with studies referring that the consideration of rainfall or the saturation vapour pressure may favour the results of the hs rs model hargreaves and samani 1985 droogers and allen 2002 almorox et al 2011 woli and paz 2011 however these interpretations have to be considered with care since in a multi regression all variables play complementary not individual roles 3 2 using the locally predicted krs to compute eto for reduced data sets the good statistical indicators associated with the developed global and climate zones eqs 29 and 30 led to a main question could these equations be used predictively to answer to this question eto pmt were computed using the krs produced by those eqs 29 and 30 and the respective accuracy was assessed against the corresponding pm eto results of regressing eto pmt against pm eto are shown in figs 2 and 3 for all sites of respectively the med climwat dataset and of the iran inner mongolia portugal and bolivian datasets regressions were performed after grouping sites by climate zones results in figs 2 and 3 are different in terms of r2 because on the one hand the med climwat dataset was previously used to derive the krs regression equations and on the other hand data are of different nature with data of med climwat consisting of observed long term monthly mean climatic data while data of other datasets are observed monthly or daily weather data therefore dispersion of points around the regression line is much smaller when the med climwat was used analyzing fig 2 it is apparent that the use of the global predictive equation leads to a decrease of b0 for the humid climates i e a tendency for under estimating eto pmt but no tendencies were detected for the other climates when using the climate zones predictive eqs 30a to 30d no tendencies are detected fig 2 which indicates an advantage of these climate focused equations the r2 values are similar for all three pmt approaches fig 2 except for the hyper arid sites with r2 slightly decreasing when the global predictive equation is used this increased dispersion around the regression line refers to the higher values of eto when aridity is highest again differences relative to the case when krs is obtained using the climate zones predictive equations are small results in fig 3 relative to the datasets consisting of daily and monthly observed data from iran inner mongolia portugal and bolivia are quite similar to those analyzed above despite r2 are small then those relative to med climwat particularly in case of humid climates however regression coefficients b0 are generally close to 1 0 except for hyper arid climates where there is a trend for under estimation of eto pmt mainly when the global predictive equation is used results for all datasets relative to using pmt with krs obtained from the global and the climate zones predictive eqs 29 and 30 are given in table 6 the regression coefficients b0 show a wider range when the global predictive equation is used with highest difference for hyper arid sites where that range changes from 0 83 1 18 to 0 88 1 09 changes in r2 are very small the modelling efficiency ef is generally high and differences between using krs from the global or the climate zones eqs 29 and 30 are negligible differently there are clear improvements in rmse particularly for the humid and the hyper arid climates when the climate zones predictive equations are used with rmse decreasing from 0 40 to 0 34 mm day 1 in case of humid climates and from 0 62 to 0 54 mm day 1 in hyper arid climates the results analyzed above particularly relative to rmse compare well with those reported in literature e g studies recently performed thepadia and martinez 2012 ren et al 2016a almorox et al 2018 paredes et al 2018b as well as referring to the accuracy of eto computed with reanalysis weather data martins et al 2017 paredes et al 2018c a more detailed analysis of the behavior of the accuracy indicators b0 and rmse relative to using predictively the global or the climate zones predictive eqs 29 and 30 to obtain krs for computing eto pmt is presented in fig 4 it compares the frequency distribution of b0 and rmse when those equations are used for humid moist and dry sub humid semiarid and arid and hyper arid climates relative to b0 it is evident that using the global equation the frequency of under estimation cases is higher particularly when comparing with humid climates relative to rmse differences in frequencies between using global or climate zones krs predictive equations are small but larger rmse are less frequent when using equations 30 however results are not definitely in favor of the climate zones predictive equations a test was performed comparing the adoption of local regional wind speed data vs default u2 2 m s 1 in case of hyper arid windy sites of inner mongolia results in fig 5 evidence that regression coefficients became closer to 1 0 when adopting a local regional long term estimate of u2 comparatively to the common default value in other words the detected under estimate of eto pmt was overcome when using local wind estimates however this improvement was not evident for other cases data not shown following results analysed above for a wide set of weather data relative to diverse climates and time steps calculations it was possible to define an improved methodology to compute eto with reduced data sets commonly referred as pmt which is easy to implement in excel it is summarized in fig 6 and

search the best empirical radiation coefficient krs through a trial and error procedure for estimating rs from temperature if searching for an appropriate estimation of tdew is relatively easy it is not the case for krs however various polynomial expressions have been proposed in the literature for estimating krs from weather variables characterizing the sites under study but their use predictively has rarely been assessed e g by thepadia and martinez 2012 moreover related literature never reported about the accuracy of eto estimates when krs is derived from a predictive equation directly or through the estimation of the hargreaves coefficient chs advancing from past research this study demonstrates that tdew and krs may be estimated for any site when a few variables characterizing the climate of the site are available so making it possible to ease the computation of eto with reduced data sets at limit when these consist of tmax and tmin only results of this study confirmed the adequateness of computing tdew tmin at with at varying from 0 to 4 c when the climate varies from sub humid to hyper arid and tdew tmean 2 in case of humid climates this approach allows to overcome influences of site aridity and local advection on the observed temperature i e allows to correct effects of non reference weather sites when computing eto relative to the rs estimation from temperature the study allowed to conclude that following previous studies with the hargreaves coefficient eq 4 it was possible to define predictive equations for krs from weather variables characteristic of the site or the region these equations may explain a large fraction of the variance of krs considering all climates together or grouped according to ai moreover the test of these equations for all sites provided for good statistical indicators when comparing eto computed with the pmt approach using the krs predictive equations comparatively to the eto computed with full data sets better results were obtained when krs predictive equations referred to the climate zones the pmt approach resulted easy to compute and related errors have shown not to be much larger than those resulting from computing krs through a trial and error procedure which is much more demanding these results are of great importance for extensively using the pmt approach when radiation is not available as well as when data sets include only tmax and tmin further research is required to compare the simplified pmt method with other approaches applicable to reduced data sets such as the use of reanalysis products martins et al 2017 paredes et al 2018c and the use of satellite data mokhtari et al 2018 trigo et al 2018 innovative approaches are likely of main interest when to be used in

11145,the computation of the reference crop evapotranspiration eto using the fao penman monteith equation pm eto requires data on maximum and minimum air temperatures tmax tmin vapour pressure deficit vpd solar radiation rs and wind speed at 2 m height u2 however those data are often not available or data sets may be incomplete or have questionable quality various procedures were proposed in fao56 to overcome these limitations and an abundant literature has been and is being produced relative to alternative computational methods studies applied to a variety of climates from hyper arid to humid have demonstrated that improved methods to compute pm eto from temperature only pmt approach have appropriate accuracy these methods refer to estimating i the dew point temperature tdew from tmin or in case of humid climates from the mean temperature tmean ii rs from the temperature difference td tmax tmin and iii u2 using default global or regional values greater difficulties refer to the need for locally calibrating the radiation adjustment coefficient krs used with the rs equation therefore considering that calibrated krs values were made available by past studies for a large number of locations and diverse climates the current study developed and tested simple computational approaches relating locally calibrated krs with various observed weather variables td relative humidity rh and average u2 the equations were developed using climwat monthly full data relative to all the mediterranean countries the equations refer to all available data or to data grouped as hyper arid and arid semi arid dry and moist sub humid and humid climates to test those krs equations eto computed from temperature and using the predicted krs values were compared with eto computed with full data sets of the same mediterranean locations and of iran inner mongolia portugal and bolivia rmse average values result then small ranging from 0 34 to 0 54 mm day 1 therefore not very far from values obtained when a trial and error procedure was used for all the same locations from 0 27 to 0 46 mm day 1 these indicators allow to propose the use of krs obtained from the predictive equations instead of locally calibrated krs values which greatly eases computations and may largely favour the use of the pmt approach keywords pm eto with reduced datasets pmt dew point temperature default wind speed solar radiation radiation adjustment coefficient krs predictive equations for krs 1 introduction the reference evapotranspiration eto allen et al 1998 also named potential et in non agricultural studies is of main importance for computing crop and vegetation evapotranspiration and for characterizing the local climate its accurate calculation is crucial in applications to crop water management irrigation planning basins water balance climate characterization and climate change studies as recently reviewed pereira et al 2015 pereira 2017 grass reference eto was defined through a fao experts consultation smith et al 1991 by parameterizing the penman monteith equation monteith 1965 for a cool season grass so resulting in the penman monteith eto pm eto grass reference eto is defined as the rate of evapotranspiration from a hypothetical reference crop with an assumed crop height h 0 12 m a fixed daily canopy resistance rs 70 s m 1 and an albedo of 0 23 closely resembling the evapotranspiration from an extensive surface of green grass of uniform height actively growing completely shading the ground and not short of water allen et al 1998 as analysed by pereira et al 1999 this definition provides for a clear distinction relative to the penman s potential et penman 1948 and the equilibrium evaporation slatyer and mcilroy 1961 which allows assuming a well defined relationship between eto and the actual vegetation et based upon the aerodynamic and surface resistances of the reference crop and of the considered vegetation surface thus supporting the concept and use of crop coefficients the computation of eto using the fao penman monteith equation pm eto requires full data sets on maximum and minimum air temperatures tmax tmin relative humidity rh or dew point temperature tdew solar radiation rs and wind speed at 2 m height u2 however those data are often not available or data sets may be incomplete or have questionable quality thus requiring the adoption of alternative computational procedures such as those proposed in fao56 allen et al 1998 to overcome those limitations in addition very numerous alternative computational methods are dealt in an abundant literature as quoted in the literature cited below however the assumed definition implies that meteorological observations should be performed over an extensive green grass field healthy and not short of water commonly designated as reference weather station site the pm eto equation is derived from the penman monteith combination equation parameterized for the grass reference crop as referred above allen et al 1998 1 e t o 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t mean 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where eto is the daily grass reference et mm day 1 rn is the net radiation at the crop surface mj m 2 day 1 g is the soil heat flux density mj m 2 day 1 tmean is the mean daily air temperature at 2 m height c u2 is the daily wind speed at 2 m height m s 1 es is the saturation vapour pressure at 2 m

constant kpa c 1 g 0 for daily computations because the daily soil heat flux beneath the grass reference surface is very small allen et al 1998 the hourly or fractions computation of eto is described by allen et al 2006 who also described the asce pm etr equation that represents alfalfa reference et while maximum and minimum temperature tmax and tmin ºc are commonly observed worldwide the other required weather variables are often not available with good quality and their acquisition may be quite expensive to cope with conditions of reduced data sets methods were proposed by allen et al 1998 for estimation of the missing variables rs ea and or u2 overall these methods consist of the so called penman monteith temperature approach pmt when relative humidity data or psychrometric observations are missing allen et al 1998 recommended computing ea assuming that the dew point temperature tdew ºc could be acceptably estimated by tmin thus resulting that actual vapour pressure is estimated as 2 e a e o t dew 0 611 exp 17 27 t min t min 237 3 this approach holds when applied to a reference site since the pm eto definition implies the consideration of an extensive and actively growing grass crop completely shading the ground and not short of water moreover allen 1996 allen et al 1998 and temesgen et al 1999 have shown that this approach eq 2 does not hold when observations are performed in non reference sites i e when weather observations are affected by aridity and or local advection which cause that tmin tdew kimball et al 1997 observed that i tmin exceeds tdew in arid sites leading to average daily differences of 0 8 to 1 2 kpa between ea computed from tmin and tdew ii in sites with semi arid climate there is seasonality in the differences between tmin and tdew resulting in differences between respective ea values varying from 0 1 to 0 6 kpa for winter and summer months respectively iii smaller differences between tmin and tdew occurred in other less arid climates e g humid continental and humid subtropical conditions with average daily differences of less than 0 3 kpa between ea computed from tmin and tdew in addition in humid locations tdew often remains above tmin resulting that eq 2 does not apply adequately numerous applications assuming tdew tmin are reported in literature applications described by liu and pereira 2001 pereira et al 2003 popova et al 2006 jabloun and sahli 2008 and córdoba et al 2015 were likely performed for reference sites the study by cai et al 2007 reported good results of using eq 2 except for a site located in a hyper arid region nevertheless the majority of worldwide weather data are likely reported from non reference sites and the adoption of tdew tmin may then cause less accuracy of eto estimates in addition data quality may play a main role in the accuracy of eto estimates allen et al 2011 the need for temperature correction was discussed by various authors particularly in fao56 allen et al 1998 thus doing tdew tmin at often proposing a correction factor at 2 or 3 c the software proposed by annandale et al 2002 took this requirement into consideration and left to the users the selection of that correction factor recently upreti and ojha 2017 adopted seasonal correction factors varying from 0 c during the wet season to 3 c during the summer months alternative computations have been proposed such as the equation developed by hubbard et al 2003 where tdew is computed from tmin tmean and the temperature difference td tmax tmin differently lobit et al 2018a computed vpd using eq 2 but adopted different parameterizations when the site was considered humid or dry in an application to the climwat data base referring to 555 stations in the mediterranean countries todorovic et al 2013 found that the correction factor at should vary with the site aridity index ai unep 1997 ratio between the long term averages of the annual precipitation and the annual potential climatic et pet thornthwaite 1948 thus at depends on the aridity of the site being larger for hyper arid locations and null for moist sub humid sites differently from more common approaches todorovic et al 2013 also proposed to compute tdew from tmean using a correction factor ad ºc for the humid sites where daily tdew is expected to be above tmin thus tdew tmean ad this approach was confirmed in applications to iran raziei and pereira 2013a inner mongolia ren et al 2016a and the azores islands paredes et al 2018a with the purpose of computing the pm eto equation in absence of radiation and or sunshine duration data allen 1997 and allen et al 1998 proposed to estimate rs using the predictive rs equation of hargreaves and samani 1982 1985 herein referred hs rs which expresses rs as a linear function of the square root of td tmax tmin 3 r s k r s t max t min 0 5 r a where krs is an empirical radiation adjustment coefficient c 0 5 and ra is the extraterrestrial radiation mj m2 day 1 this eq 3 is part of the hargreaves and samani equation hs eto which may be written as 4a e t o 0 0135 λ k r s t max t min 0 5 r a t m e a n 17 8 or as 4b e t o c hs t max t min 0 5 r a t mean 17 8 where tmean is mean daily air temperature c λ is the latent heat of vaporization commonly assumed equal to 2 45 mj kg 1 0 0135 is a factor for conversion of units from the american to the international system and 17 8 is an empirical parameter proposed by hargreaves et al 1985 when written with a hargreaves coefficient chs 0 0135 λ k r s as per eq 4b the hs eto equation is not directly expressed as influenced by the radiation adjustment coefficient krs however calibrating chs also indirectly calibrates krs following the recommendation by allen et al 1998 eq 4 is commonly used as alternative to pm eto eq 1 when only reduced data sets are available numerous studies focused on both equations 3 and 4 particularly on the accuracy of eq 3 i e the solar energy term of eq 4 comparatively with other rs estimation equations despite many authors keep using the default krs values 0 16 and 0 19 c 0 5 for respectively inland and coastal sites allen et al 1998 a great deal of research has provided for more accurate estimation of krs directly or through estimating chs for a variety of environments this coefficient krs relates with the atmospheric conditions that influence the availability of incoming solar radiation at crop and natural surfaces so the availability of energy for evaporation allen 1997 suggested estimating krs as a function of elevation to account for the effect of the thickness of the atmosphere on the volumetric heat capacity of the atmosphere thus making 5 krs kro pz po 0 5 where pz and po are the mean atmospheric pressure kpa at the site and at the sea level respectively and kro is the original value of krs 0 16 or 0 17 c 0 5 after samani 2000 later with the same purpose of taking account for effects of reduced atmospheric thickness on rs annandale et al 2002 made krs directly dependent of the elevation z m of the site 6 krs kro 1 2 7 10 5 z samani 2000 to ease the use of eq 4 without requiring local calibration of krs adopted a polynomial relationship with the long term average temperature difference tdavg ºc characterizing the site since it may be considered as an indicator of the energy available at the site 7 krs 0 00185 tdavg 2 0 0433 tdavg 0 4023 similarly mendicino and senatore 2013 developed polynomial relationships with tdavg to predict chs for various regions of italy differently vanderlinden et al 2004 proposed a linear estimator of chs using the ratio of daily averages tavg tdavg as predictor adapting this approach thepadia and martinez 2012 developed a linear krs prediction equation using data of humid sites 8 krs a tavg tdavg b later martí et al 2015 assessed various polynomial equations to estimate the chs from various weather and geographical site characteristics in eastern spain the hs rs models where krs is replaced by a predictive equation as those described above are often named after the respective authors however the radiation prediction model is the same the hs rs model eq 3 and what changes is the parameterization of krs that way of renaming the hs rs model due to differences in parameterization results confuse users as the varied nomenclature and terminology used is also confusing various models to estimate rs from temperature were developed in addition to that of eq 3 they have been the object of diverse comparative studies however these studies do not provide for a definitive ranking of models on the one hand model results depend upon the way how they were parameterized and on the other hand the ranking depends on the selected goodness of fit indicators and on the objectives of modelling e g energy assessments et estimation or crop yield predictions rankings obtained from comparative studies result therefore difficult to interpret an early study applied to argentina meza and varas 2000 shows a slight advantage of hs rs over the bc rs model of bristow and campbell 1984 chen et al 2004 considered negatively the hs rs model and developed a logarithmic td equation for replacing hs rs in china a study applied to central europe trnka et al 2007 compared various rs models in terms of their impacts on the performance of crop yield models and has shown that simple td models ranked below various models that used other variables in addition to td comparative studies by abraha and savage 2008 applied to selected weather stations across the world have shown that the hs rs model ranked high among various models including first ranked in some cases a study applied to selected chinese stations liu et al 2009 has shown that hs rs ranked high but preference was assigned to the bc rs model due to its accuracy and because parameters could be estimated from weather variables so not requiring calibration using observation data that same bc rs model was also reported with high ranking in a comparative study relative to four countries in four continents moradi et al 2014 but with two different versions of hs rs showing good performances almorox et al 2011 applied various rs models to several locations in central spain and found that hs rs performed best however authors developed a new model where a saturated vapour pressure es term was used in addition to td later almorox et al 2013 reported that performances of two versions of the hs rs equation were similar to that of bc rs in a study performed in mexico quej et al 2017 the best ranking was for bc rs but hs rs ranked high contrasting in a later study applied to mexico lobit et al 2018b none of those models was considered satisfactorily and a new model was developed modified from bc rs also using td in a study applied to usa woli and paz 2011 comparing 16 rs models a modified version of the hs rs equation ranked in the mid of the list while higher performances were assigned to models that in addition to td included daily rainfall as predictor a model comparison performed for a set of iranian stations jahani et al 2017 has shown that hs rs models performed well mainly when elevation was considered eq 6 however they ranked below various purposefully developed td polynomial equations however of local interest only the performance of various forms of hs rs models were also good but not the best as reported for other studies in iran besharat et al 2013 and canada aladenola and madramootoo 2014 summarizing the comparative studies of rs prediction models do not provide for a clear ranking of models because they are conceptually different and are applied to a variety of sites having diverse environmental conditions different data availability and diverse modelling objectives various comparisons did not focus et applications but local or regional solar energy studies therefore having requirements different of those where rs is used to compute eto studies have shown that higher prediction performances require somewhat complex parameterization so contradicting the simplicity of the original hs rs eq 3 that simplicity was a main reason why hs rs was proposed to compute the pm eto when only reduced data sets are available allen et al 1998 the referred studies also show that despite the hs rs eq 3 may not be the best estimator of rs it certainly is highly valuable to provide for computing eto when solar radiation or sunshine duration are not observed numerous applications have demonstrated the appropriateness of the hs rs model for estimating rs for pm eto computations with reduced data sets among the first results are those for china by liu and pereira 2001 and pereira et al 2003 for bulgaria popova et al 2006 and for tunisia jabloun and sahli 2008 these studies used simple tests to get the best krs values which varied in a limited range the recommendation by allen 1997 to adopt self calibration had no followers because it is quite demanding bandyopadhyay et al 2008 used also a demanding calibration procedure with back estimation of rs to estimate the krs coefficients for a large set of weather stations in india trial and error procedures for the calibration of krs were later used by todorovic et al 2013 raziei and pereira 2013a ren al 2016a and paredes et al 2018a which aimed at minimizing the differences between pm eto computed with full data or with rs estimated with hs rs the available studies allow to understand that krs varies spatially not only with site elevation but also with the distance to large water bodies as earlier discussed by hargreaves and samani 1982 1985 allen 1997 and hargreaves and allen 2003 the effect of the proximity to large water bodies particularly the sea may refer to the peculiar behaviour of both wind and air moisture in coastal areas which were supposed to increase krs relative to inland areas in addition recent studies raziei and pereira 2013a ren et al 2016a paredes et al 2018a reported that krs increases with the aridity of the site and with wind speed reduced data sets often do not include wind speed data under these circumstances allen et al 1998 proposed the use of the world average wind speed value u2 2 m s 1 as the default estimator of wind speed when related data are missing when average local or regional wind speed data are available they could be used alternatively following results reported by popova et al 2006 jabloun and sahli 2008 and paredes et al 2018a nevertheless as discussed by allen et al 1998 impacts of wind speed are generally not large except for areas where aridity dominates the use of the above referred approaches for estimating the parameters of the pm eto equation allows computing eto just replacing rs ea or u2 by their respective estimators when related weather variables are missing or using temperature data only when more variables are lacking the above quoted bibliography includes adequate examples of computing eto with the pmt approach considering the discussion above on procedures to compute rs ea and u2 with reduced data sets and observing that there is a limited use of those computational procedures despite various studies show that related calculations are often accurately performed the objectives of this study consist of a revising the use of available procedures for estimating tdew from temperature wind speed from local or default values and solar radiation from the temperature difference b developing multiple regression equations for the empirical radiation adjustment coefficient krs to be used in assessing rs from temperature and c testing such equations for various regions and climates as a contribution to define a consolidated method for computing the pm eto from temperature when only reduced datasets are available 2 materials and methods 2 1 data various data sets consisting of daily and monthly weather data were used in the present study main data are from the climwat database smith 1993 which version 2 0 consists of observed long term monthly mean climatic data from over 5000 meteorological stations worldwide the weather data include monthly mean data for maximum and minimum temperature tmax and tmin ºc solar radiation rs mj m 2 day 1 mean relative humidity rh and wind speed u2 km day 1 in addition the database also includes monthly mean data on total and effective precipitation p and pe mm and on monthly mean daily grass reference evapotranspiration eto mm day 1 computed with the pm eto equation eq 1 the climwat database has been used in several evapotranspiration studies namely those reported by allen 1996 1997 temesgen et al 1999 and droogers and allen 2002 data used in this study are about the same as previously used by todorovic et al 2013 and refer to the mediterranean countries with a total number of 588 weather stations fig 1 hereafter called med climwat all stations are distributed into six climate zones defined according to the unep aridity index ai unep 1997 with ai consisting of the ratio between the long term mean of annual precipitation p mm and annual potential climatic evapotranspiration petth mm thornthwaite 1948 the distribution of weather stations into the various ai climate zones is represented in fig 1 the respective spatial distribution shows that most humid and sub humid climates are located in the northern mediterranean countries semiarid climates mostly occur nearby the mediterranean sea while arid and hyper arid climates dominate in the southern mediterranean countries fig 1 also shows that a good number of stations are located by the coast overall the selected weather stations are well distributed throughout the mediterranean region and refer to a large spectrum of environmental conditions as summarized in table 2 where ranges of eto and elevation are presented in relation to the various climate zones krs values of the selected mediterranean stations range from 0 11 to 0 28 c

duration n hour and wind speed u2 m s 1 relative to 37 iranian synoptic stations the majority of the selected stations had nearly complete data records for the period 1971 2005 their data passed careful quality control by the iranian meteorological organization and were further analysed by the authors of the study for possible non homogeneities resulting that the wind datasets at 7 stations were corrected against neighbouring stations following the proposed approaches by allen et al 1998 the distribution of the selected stations in terms of climate zones defined by the aridity index ai unep 1997 is summarized in table 1 ai varies from humid and sub humid near the caspian sea in north eastern iran dry sub humid and semi arid in the northern and western regions to arid and hyper arid in central and southern iran the ranges of eto and elevation are given in table 2 in relation to the referred climate zones a spatial analysis relative to the weather variables used to compute eto and of eto itself as well as relative to their seasonality is reported by raziei and pereira 2013b the krs values used in the current study ranged from 0 11 to 0 21 c 0 5 with larger values generally assigned to arid and hyper arid sites raziei and pereira 2013a data of inner mongolia used herein refer to those adopted in the study reported by ren et al 2016a they consist of monthly precipitation

and have been submitted to quality control previously to be used the selected weather stations are well distributed throughout inner mongolia the aridity index ai varies from moist sub humid in the east to hyper arid in the west coherently eto increases from the eastern to the western inner mongolia the distribution of weather stations per climate zone is shown in table 1 while the ranges of eto

analysis of weather variables and eto including when computed by the pmt approach are presented by ren et al 2016b daily data relative to 4 weather stations in the bolivian altiplano chipana et al

classified as dry sub humid climates table 1 the range of eto is given in table 2 krs varied from 0 13 to 0 14 c 0 5 daily weather data of portugal consisted of two datasets relative to the azores archipelago and to continental portugal the azores dataset used in the present study refer to 19 weather stations located in eight islands paredes et al 2018a b data included precipitation mm tmax and tmin c rh u2 m s 1 and solar radiation rs w m 2 or sunshine duration n hour all data were collected above green grass daily data refers to periods whose lengths varied between 283 and 5478 days a data quality control was performed according to recommendations by allen et al 1998 the yearly average precipitation varies with longitude from 730 mm year 1 in santa maria the east most island to 1666 mm year 1 in flores the west most island the weather variables largely vary within the months throughout the year air humidity is generally high with median rh close to 80 the dominant winds are from sw with high moisture winds are often strong mainly in winter and show a great variability within months the variability of solar radiation is high due to effects of variable cloudiness eto is greater in summer months and does not change much from an island to another for all stations ai ranged from 2 0 to 8 6 thus indicating that a humid climate prevails in all islands however krs varied in a large range from 0 14 to 0 24 c 0 5 paredes et al 2018a the dataset relative to continental portugal consists of 37 weather stations 27 from the portuguese meteorological institute ipma and 10 from the irrigation operative center cotr and refer to periods of various lengths from 2004 to 13 111 days most of these stations were used in a study on application of era interim reanalysis data to compute eto paredes et al 2018c data refers to precipitation mm tmax and tmin oc rh u2 m s 1 and rs mj m 2 day 1 or n hour the quality of observed data was previously assessed using the techniques described in fao56 allen et al 1998 the distribution of weather stations per climate zone is also shown in table 1 ranges of eto and station elevations are summarized in table 2 krs ranged from 0 11 to 0 26 c 0 5 2 2 computation of eto with full data sets when full weather data sets were available the pm eto eq 1 was computed using the standard methods described in fao56 allen et al 1998 eq 1 was used as standard for assessing the performance of the alternative approaches used to compute eto with reduced data sets the saturation vapour pressure es kpa was computed from observed tmax and tmin as 9 e s

and rhmin ea was computed as 12 e a e o t min r h max 100 e o t max r h min 100 2 thus taking into consideration tmax and tmin for increased accuracy allen et al 1998 net radiation rn was computed as the algebraic sum of the net short wave radiation rns and the net long wave radiation rnl with all radiation units expressed in mj m 2 day 1 13 r n r ns r nl rns represents the balance between incoming and reflected solar radiation 14 r ns 1 α r s where rs is the incoming solar radiation and α is the albedo or canopy reflection coefficient fixed to 0 23 as for the definition of the grass

as a function of the day in the year and the latitude of the site the default values as 0 25 and bs 0 50 recommended by allen et al 1998 were used except for the high elevation sites in the bolivian altiplano where calibrated values were adopted chipana et al 2010 net long wave radiation rnl resulting from the balance between the outgoing long wave radiation emitted by the vegetation and the soil

constant 4 90 10 9 mj m 2 k 4 day 1 and tkx and tkn are respectively tmax and tmin expressed in kelvin k the cloudiness factor f is a linear function of the ratio rs rso between actual incoming

calculations g was computed as 20 gmonth i 0 07 tmonth i 1 tmonth i 1 thus from the temperatures of the following and past months i 1 and i 1 allen et al 1998 to adjust wind speed data uz obtained by

pmt approach the need to correct tmin to accurately estimating tdew in arid areas was early well identified following the studies by todorovic et al 2013 raziei and pereira 2013a ren et al 2016a and paredes et al 2018a a clear set of temperature corrections was adopted the latter are defined according to the local aridity index unep 1997 22 ai p pe t th ratio between the long term means of the annual precipitation p and the annual potential climatic evapotranspiration petth thornthwaite 1948 ai is computed for the largest number of yearly data available for the site petth may be computed as described by pereira and pruitt 2004 in addition a software to compute petth has been proposed by tigkas et al 2015 the best approaches for computing tdew following the above referred studies consist of 23 tdew tmin at if ai 1 00 where at assumes one of the following values depending upon the local ai a hyper arid locations ai 0 05 at 4 c b arid locations 0 05 ai 0 20 at 2 c c semiarid locations

those tdew values in the actual vapour pressure equation eq 10 it results respectively the following actual vapour pressure equations to be used when observations of air moisture are lacking to be

measurements was performed using the default value of u2 2 m s 1 this was the only viable procedure considering the variety of data used belonging to diverse databases the use of estimated local values revealed not possible nevertheless former studies confirmed that for areas where climate is mild the impact of wind speed on eto is quite limited differently for arid and windy sites the use of under estimated u2 values e g adopting the referred default value may lead to underestimation of the computed eto however the number of these situations was very reduced in the datasets used in the current study when radiation or sunshine duration measurements are not available the pmt method estimates the incoming solar radiation from the hs rs eq 3 as discussed before that discussion has shown that the hs rs method may not be the best but it is certainly appropriate to compute rs in absence of observations of radiation or sunshine duration when aiming at estimating eto in the current study the krs values in eq 3 were computed for every site using a trial and error procedure for searching the krs value that minimizes the difference between eto computed with full data sets pm eto and with the pmt approach eto pmt when adopting the tdew and u2 estimation procedures described above considering the studies by samani 2000 thepadia and martinez 2012 mendicino and senatore 2013 and martí et al 2015 among others all the computed krs relative to the med climwat dataset were used in a regression analysis to assess their relationships with various climatic and geographical variables characteristics of the respective sites the variables used as predictors include averages of td tmean the ratio tmean td u2 rh as well as the aridity index ai and the elevation z m which characterize each site regressions were performed either considering those variables alone or in combination with one or two others all possible single and multiple linear regressions between locally calibrated krs and those predictors were tested and the regression equations were compared based on several statistical indicators including the multiple coefficient of correlation the coefficient of determination r2 the adjusted r2 the f values in the goodness of fit tests and their significance p values in addition for each predictor the regression coefficient the standard error the confidence interval and the p value of the zero null hypothesis were analysed the multiple regression equations were developed for all med climwat sites together and after analyzing their statistical indicators one equation was selected using the same predictors multiple regression equations were also developed for the stations grouped by aridity index into four groups relative to the sites classified as hyper arid and arid semi arid dry and moist sub humid and humid the regression equations were developed with data relative to 555 weather stations from the med climwat data set 33 outliers were identified and consequently excluded using their common definition tukey 1977 any data point more than 1 5 interquartile ranges below the first quartile or above the third quartile the selected global and ai grouped multiple regression equations were tested with data relative to all datasets described before thus for a total of 699 sites 2 4 accuracy indicators the accuracy of various eto pmt computation approaches was assessed by comparing eto pmt results with pm eto computed for the same sites with this purpose several statistical indicators were used 1 the regression coefficient b0 of the regression forced to the origin fto eisenhauer 2003 between pm eto computed with full data sets oi x and eto pmt computed with the pmt approach pi y a value of b0 1 0 indicates that the fitted line is y x thus oi and pi are similar a value of b0 1 0 suggests overestimation and b0 1 0 underestimation 2 the determination coefficient r2 of the ordinary least squares ols regression between oi and pi where a r2 close to 1 0 indicates that most of the variation of the observed values is explained by the estimation approach used however a high value of r2 is in itself insufficient to state that there is good overall agreement between observed and estimated values 3 the root mean square error rmse which measures the overall differences between observed oi and predicted pi values 27 rmse i 1 n p i o i 2 n 0 5 which should be as small as possible it has the same units of the variable under analysis 4 the nash and sutcliffe 1970 modelling efficiency ef non dimensional that provides an indication of the relative magnitude of the mean square error mse rmse2 relative to the observed data variance 28 ef 1 0 i 1 m o i p i 2 i 1 m o i o 2 the maximum value ef 1 0 can only be achieved if there is a perfect match between all observed oi and predicted pi values thus when rmse 0 r2 1 0 and b0 1 the closer the values of ef are to 1 0 the better estimators of pm eto are the eto pmt values as discussed by legates and mccabe jr 1999 negative values of ef indicate that mse is larger than the observed data variance meaning that the estimation approach is less appropriate for the intended prediction 3 results and discussion 3 1 relating the radiation adjustment coefficient krs with site weather variables the use of pmt was revised for all datasets the accuracy indicators relative to eto pmt when the radiation coefficient krs was estimated by trial and error applied to each location are given in table 3 the regression coefficient b0 varies little around its target value 1 0 and does not show tendency for over or under estimation moreover it is associated with very high r2 which indicates that most of the variation of the observed values is explained by the pmt approach used the rmse are quite small with averages varying from 0 27 mm day 1 in case of humid climates to 0 46 mm day 1 for arid climates all ef values are high thus indicating that mean square errors are much lower than the variance of observations these results particularly rmse compare favourably with those in literature e g studies recently performed by ren et al 2016a almorox et al 2018 and paredes et al 2018b as well as when assessing the accuracy of eto computation using reanalysis weather data martins et al 2017 paredes et al 2018c the good accuracy results in table 3 are certainly related with the accuracy of estimating krs using a trial and error procedure for every site these conditions favour to assess the relationships between krs and main climate variables observed which may influence its value as referred before the considered variables are tdavg c the long term average of the temperature differences tmax tmin tavg c the long term average of the mean air temperatures tmean t td avg c the long term average of the ratios tmean tmax tmin u2 avg m s 1 the long term average of the wind speed at 2 m height rhavg the long term average of rhmean the aridity index ai eq 22 the site elevation z m the linear regression equations relating krs with the above defined variables were developed for all sites of the med climwat dataset considering the predictor variables isolated paired and grouped by 3 as presented in table 4 results are presented in a decreasing order of the statistical indicators characterizing each regression for the three cases relative to the number of predictors statistical indicators show that best results were achieved when considering three predictors when only one predictor is considered the best indicators are t td avg tdavg and u2 avg the first two could be expected considering the common eqs 7 and 8 contrarily to expected eqs 5 and 6 elevation has quite low effects on the prediction when two variables are considered together the best statistical indicators refer to the pairs tdavg u2 avg and tdavg rhavg these results confirm the importance of wind speed already identified when single variables were considered and introduce the relative humidity as a variable influencing krs the best results table 4 were for a combination of three variables tdavg u2 avg and rhavg which were already identified as best predictors when just one or two variables were considered statistical indicators of the linear regression ranked first are definitely better than those of the second ranked equation which had in common two of the considered variables particularly important is the fact that the first ranked equation has an adjusted r2 of 0 69 vs an adjusted r2 of 0 56 of the second one in other words the equation krs f tdavg u2 avg rhavg is able to explain 69 of the variance of krs while the second one krs f t td avg u2 avg rhavg explains only 56 of the same variance that first equation was therefore selected and writes as follows 29 k rs 0 365 0 010 t d avg 0 019 u 2 avg 0 002 r h avg with all 3 variables being long term averages as defined before that eq 29 refers to a wide panoply of climates with ai ranging from 0 in various desert sites in libya and egypt to 3 1 in a humid site of turkey therefore the med climwat sites were grouped into four climate zones and krs equations relative to the same predictors were developed for those climatic zones resulting in the following equations a humid climate ai 1 0 30a k rs 0 519 0 010 t d avg 0 019 u 2 avg 0 003 r h avg b moist and dry sub humid climates 0 50 ai 1 0 30b k rs 0 396 0 011 t d avg 0 019 u 2 avg 0 002 r h avg c semi arid climates 0 20 ai 0 50 30c k rs 0 388 0 010 t d avg 0 022 u 2 avg 0 002 r h avg d arid and hyper arid climates ai 0 20 30d k rs 0 217 0 004 t d avg 0 035 u 2 avg 0 001 r h avg the statistical results relative to all 5 equations the global one 29 and those relative to the climate zones 30a through 30d are presented in table 5 results show a strong linear relationship between the dependent variable krs and the independent variables tdavg u2 avg rhavg with multiple coefficient of correlation values higher than 0 83 r2 0 70 and adjusted r2 above 0 69 these indicators show that most of the variance of krs is explained by the linear multiple regression equations particularly when sites were grouped by climate zone this could be expected because grouping the sites according to their climate features reduces the variability of the climate variables influencing the computation of krs in addition the overall goodness of fit f test gives p values close to zero so rejecting the null hypothesis likewise the p values for the regression coefficient tests for all variables are almost null moreover the confidence intervals for the regression coefficients do not include the null value thus assuring that the contribution of the associated predictors are statistically significant the good results obtained in terms of statistical indicators may be explained by the combined role that the selected variables may play in terms of influencing krs values tdavg has a negative regression coefficient which may refer to the fact that when tdavg is high more energy is lost as long wave radiation see eq 16 through 19 the wind speed average is likely associated with clearness of the atmosphere at the site which depends upon the wind transport of air moisture away this fact was noticed when earlier studies defined a larger krs for coastal areas where wind is often higher than inland allen 1997 allen et al 1998 as well as in studies by raziei and pereira 2013a ren et al 2016a and paredes et al 2018a finally considering that rhavg has a negative regression coefficient that variable may represent the influence of cloudiness and air moisture which is in agreement with studies referring that the consideration of rainfall or the saturation vapour pressure may favour the results of the hs rs model hargreaves and samani 1985 droogers and allen 2002 almorox et al 2011 woli and paz 2011 however these interpretations have to be considered with care since in a multi regression all variables play complementary not individual roles 3 2 using the locally predicted krs to compute eto for reduced data sets the good statistical indicators associated with the developed global and climate zones eqs 29 and 30 led to a main question could these equations be used predictively to answer to this question eto pmt were computed using the krs produced by those eqs 29 and 30 and the respective accuracy was assessed against the corresponding pm eto results of regressing eto pmt against pm eto are shown in figs 2 and 3 for all sites of respectively the med climwat dataset and of the iran inner mongolia portugal and bolivian datasets regressions were performed after grouping sites by climate zones results in figs 2 and 3 are different in terms of r2 because on the one hand the med climwat dataset was previously used to derive the krs regression equations and on the other hand data are of different nature with data of med climwat consisting of observed long term monthly mean climatic data while data of other datasets are observed monthly or daily weather data therefore dispersion of points around the regression line is much smaller when the med climwat was used analyzing fig 2 it is apparent that the use of the global predictive equation leads to a decrease of b0 for the humid climates i e a tendency for under estimating eto pmt but no tendencies were detected for the other climates when using the climate zones predictive eqs 30a to 30d no tendencies are detected fig 2 which indicates an advantage of these climate focused equations the r2 values are similar for all three pmt approaches fig 2 except for the hyper arid sites with r2 slightly decreasing when the global predictive equation is used this increased dispersion around the regression line refers to the higher values of eto when aridity is highest again differences relative to the case when krs is obtained using the climate zones predictive equations are small results in fig 3 relative to the datasets consisting of daily and monthly observed data from iran inner mongolia portugal and bolivia are quite similar to those analyzed above despite r2 are small then those relative to med climwat particularly in case of humid climates however regression coefficients b0 are generally close to 1 0 except for hyper arid climates where there is a trend for under estimation of eto pmt mainly when the global predictive equation is used results for all datasets relative to using pmt with krs obtained from the global and the climate zones predictive eqs 29 and 30 are given in table 6 the regression coefficients b0 show a wider range when the global predictive equation is used with highest difference for hyper arid sites where that range changes from 0 83 1 18 to 0 88 1 09 changes in r2 are very small the modelling efficiency ef is generally high and differences between using krs from the global or the climate zones eqs 29 and 30 are negligible differently there are clear improvements in rmse particularly for the humid and the hyper arid climates when the climate zones predictive equations are used with rmse decreasing from 0 40 to 0 34 mm day 1 in case of humid climates and from 0 62 to 0 54 mm day 1 in hyper arid climates the results analyzed above particularly relative to rmse compare well with those reported in literature e g studies recently performed thepadia and martinez 2012 ren et al 2016a almorox et al 2018 paredes et al 2018b as well as referring to the accuracy of eto computed with reanalysis weather data martins et al 2017 paredes et al 2018c a more detailed analysis of the behavior of the accuracy indicators b0 and rmse relative to using predictively the global or the climate zones predictive eqs 29 and 30 to obtain krs for computing eto pmt is presented in fig 4 it compares the frequency distribution of b0 and rmse when those equations are used for humid moist and dry sub humid semiarid and arid and hyper arid climates relative to b0 it is evident that using the global equation the frequency of under estimation cases is higher particularly when comparing with humid climates relative to rmse differences in frequencies between using global or climate zones krs predictive equations are small but larger rmse are less frequent when using equations 30 however results are not definitely in favor of the climate zones predictive equations a test was performed comparing the adoption of local regional wind speed data vs default u2 2 m s 1 in case of hyper arid windy sites of inner mongolia results in fig 5 evidence that regression coefficients became closer to 1 0 when adopting a local regional long term estimate of u2 comparatively to the common default value in other words the detected under estimate of eto pmt was overcome when using local wind estimates however this improvement was not evident for other cases data not shown following results analysed above for a wide set of weather data relative to diverse climates and time steps calculations it was possible to define an improved methodology to compute eto with reduced data sets commonly referred as pmt which is easy to implement in excel it is summarized in fig 6 and

search the best empirical radiation coefficient krs through a trial and error procedure for estimating rs from temperature if searching for an appropriate estimation of tdew is relatively easy it is not the case for krs however various polynomial expressions have been proposed in the literature for estimating krs from weather variables characterizing the sites under study but their use predictively has rarely been assessed e g by thepadia and martinez 2012 moreover related literature never reported about the accuracy of eto estimates when krs is derived from a predictive equation directly or through the estimation of the hargreaves coefficient chs advancing from past research this study demonstrates that tdew and krs may be estimated for any site when a few variables characterizing the climate of the site are available so making it possible to ease the computation of eto with reduced data sets at limit when these consist of tmax and tmin only results of this study confirmed the adequateness of computing tdew tmin at with at varying from 0 to 4 c when the climate varies from sub humid to hyper arid and tdew tmean 2 in case of humid climates this approach allows to overcome influences of site aridity and local advection on the observed temperature i e allows to correct effects of non reference weather sites when computing eto relative to the rs estimation from temperature the study allowed to conclude that following previous studies with the hargreaves coefficient eq 4 it was possible to define predictive equations for krs from weather variables characteristic of the site or the region these equations may explain a large fraction of the variance of krs considering all climates together or grouped according to ai moreover the test of these equations for all sites provided for good statistical indicators when comparing eto computed with the pmt approach using the krs predictive equations comparatively to the eto computed with full data sets better results were obtained when krs predictive equations referred to the climate zones the pmt approach resulted easy to compute and related errors have shown not to be much larger than those resulting from computing krs through a trial and error procedure which is much more demanding these results are of great importance for extensively using the pmt approach when radiation is not available as well as when data sets include only tmax and tmin further research is required to compare the simplified pmt method with other approaches applicable to reduced data sets such as the use of reanalysis products martins et al 2017 paredes et al 2018c and the use of satellite data mokhtari et al 2018 trigo et al 2018 innovative approaches are likely of main interest when to be used in

11146,water resources are increasingly scarce and droughts are frequent in the huang huai hai plain of china there is an urgent need for developing water saving technologies for winter wheat production in this region field experiments were carried out in silty loam soil from 2012 to 2014 based on the same water condition in seeding period and the normal emergence of winter wheat five supplemental irrigation si regimes differing in the timing of si were established crop development was categorized using the zadoks scale t1 no irrigation after emergence t2 si at jointing 4th node detectable z34 t3 si at pre wintering average daily temperature drops to about 2 and the wheat plant basically stops growing and jointing t4 si at jointing and anthesis complete z69 t5 si at pre wintering jointing and anthesis complete the results showed that si brought the soil water content in the 0 20 cm profile to 100 field capacity at the pre wintering jointing and anthesis complete stages of winter wheat mainly improving the water supply condition in the 0 40 cm soil layer compared with no irrigation after emergence si at jointing and anthesis complete significantly increased grain yield by increasing the spike number kernel number and grain weight si at the pre wintering stage can improve grain number and yield under the condition of no si at anthesis complete comparing t3 with t2 but had no significant effect on grain yield when si was supplied at jointing and anthesis complete comparing t5 with t4 and even worse the irrigation water use efficiency decreased the decrease of water supply before anthesis complete significantly reduced the dry matter accumulation and photosynthetic rate at anthesis but promoted the translocation of photosynthates to the plant ear si at anthesis complete is advantageous for the assimilation of carbohydrates in the middle and late grain filling stage and for the distribution of those carbohydrates from vegetative organs to grain these results indicated that si at jointing and anthesis complete was conducive to coordinating the relationship between photosynthesis and photosynthates retranslocated after anthesis and may improve the harvest index grain yield and water use efficiency keywords winter wheat supplemental irrigation 13c photosynthate accumulation and transportation dry matter water use efficiency 1 introduction the huang huai hai plain is the main wheat triticum aestivum l producing area in china the planting area of wheat in this region is more than 60 of the total national planting area national bureau of statistics of china 2017 however the water resources are increasingly scarce and droughts are frequent in this region kang and zhang 2016 these adverse factors are seriously threatening wheat production food security and water security therefore the invention of effective irrigation techniques is crucial to maintaining high yields of winter wheat through improved water use efficiency wue water stress during grain filling reduces photosynthesis induces early senescence and shortens the grain filling period yang and zhang 2005 carbohydrates supporting the increase in grain dry weights during grain filling are derived from two sources 1 current photoassimilation and 2 stored carbohydrate reserves in vegetative organs gebbing et al 1999 wang et al 2012 the fractional distribution of the 14c remaining at maturity varied with labeling date and cultivar the fraction of 14c in the spike was 0 35 to 0 5 when labeled at the heading with less than 0 15 in the grain when labeled during grain filling a greater fraction of 14c was distributed to the spike in the semi dwarf cultivars than the tall cultivars at 0 9 and 0 8 respectively and most of the 14c in the spike was in the grain gent and kiyomoto 1989 under dry field conditions the apparent contribution of stored carbohydrate reserves could be 75 100 of the grain yield in wheat compared with 37 39 under high rainfall conditions van herwaarden et al 1998 although postanthesis water deficits increased the contributions of preanthesis c to the grain significantly decreased the postanthesis assimilation palta et al 1994 total non structural carbohydrates concentration in the stems was increased during the 6 days from anthesis yang et al 2004 which seems to indicate that supply of carbohydrates is not the limiting factor of grain yield formation in early stage of wheat grain development there is close association between photoassimilates partitioning to the grain during anthesis to 16 days after anthesis and individual grain weight joudi 2017 therefore we may assume that on the basis of maintaining a certain amount of dry matter accumulation in vegetative organs before anthesis the grain filling rate should be accelerated by adjusting the soil moisture to moderate deficit in early stage of wheat grain development and then inducing more current photoassimilates to transport into grains rather than to remain in vegetative organs so as to further improve the harvest index and tap the potential of increasing grain weight it has been demonstrated that supplemental irrigation si delayed from the beginning of anthesis to the completion of anthesis increases the partitioning of 14c assimilated by flag leaf at the boot stage to grains at maturity lin et al 2016 based on the previous research this paper established five si regimes differing in the timing of si to explore ways that accelerates photoassimilates transport to grains by reducing times of si before anthesis 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site field experiments were conducted from october 2012 to june 2014 in shijiawangzi village yanzhou 116 41 e 35 40 n which is located in the center of the huang huai hai plain of china and its environment is representative of the plain the soil of the experimental field was silty loam and the previous crop was corn zea mays l the organic matter total nitrogen hydrolyzable nitrogen available phosphorus and available potassium in the topsoil 0 20 cm of the experimental plots are shown in table 1 the bulk density field capacity and relative water content in the 0 20 and 0 200 cm soil layers of the experimental field before sowing were 1 60 and 1 63 g cm 3 24 6 and 23 6 and 64 1 and 82 2 in 2012 2013 and 1 40 and 1 52 g cm 3 29 0 and 26 2 and 32 6 and 61 9 in 2013 2014 respectively the annual precipitation was 521 5 and 537 0 mm and the precipitation during the growing seasons were 143 0 and 217 5 mm in 2012 2013 and 2013 2014 respectively the monthly climatic conditions rainfall and temperature of the experimental site during the wheat growing season from october 2012 to june 2014 are shown in fig 1 2 2 experimental design based on the same soil moisture regulation of sowing to ensure the normal emergence of the winter wheat five irrigation treatments were applied t1 t2 t3 t4 and t5 differing in the timing of si as shown in table 2 crop development was categorized using the zadoks scale zadoks et al 1974 the t1 treatment was rainfed no irrigation after emergence in the t2 treatment si was applied at the jointing 4th node detectable z34 stage in the t3 treatment si was applied at the pre wintering average daily temperature drops to about 2 and the wheat plant basically stops growing and jointing z34 stages in the t4 treatment si was applied at the jointing z34 and anthesis complete z69 stages in the t5 treatment si was applied at the pre wintering jointing z34 and anthesis complete z69 stages the amount of si was calculated from the relative water content in the 0 20 cm soil layer using the methods of wang et al 2013 the target relative water content in the 0 20 cm soil layer after si was 100 field capacity the amount of si under different treatments and the changes of the average relative water content at different depths of the soil layers before and after irrigation are shown in tables 2 and 3 respectively water was sprayed evenly onto the experimental plots under pressure a flow meter was used to measure the amount of water applied each experimental plot was 4 8 m2 in size and replicated thrice in randomized block designs between the two adjacent irrigation plots a 1 5 m wide unirrigated zone was maintained to minimize the effects of adjacent plots 2 3 crop management all plots were supplied with 105 kg of n ha 1 150 kg of p2o5 ha 1 and 150 kg of k2o ha 1 at the time of seeding and 135 kg of n ha 1 at the jointing stage the high yielding wheat triticum aestivum l cultivar jimai22 was used in these experiments wheat seeds were sown at a density of 180 plants m 2 on october 10 and october 9 in 2012 and 2013 respectively the wheat was harvested on june 14 2013 and may 30 2014 2 4 soil relative water content soil samples were collected using a soil corer at 20 cm increments down to 200 cm in all experimental plots the soil water content gravimetric water content was measured using the oven drying method measurements were performed before sowing pre wintering and at the jointing anthesis and maturity stages before and after irrigation the soil relative water content 100 x soil water content field capacity 2 5 photosynthetic rate of flag leaves flag leaves were analyzed at 0 7 14 21 and 28 days after beginning of anthesis daa for the rate of net co2 assimilation photosynthetic rate pn with a ciras 2 portable photosynthesis system pp systems hitchin uk the measurements were taken from 9 00 am until 12 00 am 2 6 assimilate accumulation and remobilization after anthesis the assimilate production after anthesis and the apparent remobilization of preanthesis stored assimilates were calculated according to papakosta and gagianas 1991 the apparent remobilization of preanthesis stored assimilates kg ha 1 was calculated as the dry matter of aerial plant parts at anthesis kg ha 1 minus the dry matter of leaves stems sheaths stalk and glume at maturity kg ha 1 the assimilate production after anthesis kg ha 1 was calculated as the grain weight kg ha 1 minus the apparent remobilization of preanthesis stored assimilates kg ha 1 the proportion of grain yield derived from remobilization was calculated as the apparent remobilization of preanthesis stored assimilates divided by the grain weight for these estimates it was assumed that all of the dry matter lost from vegetative plant parts was remobilized into the grain losses of dry matter due to plant respiration during grain ﬁlling were not considered 2 7 stable carbon isotope 13c labeling of assimilates in 2012 2013 flag leaves from 20 stems that blooms on the same day per plot were chosen at random and labeled with 13co2 between 9 00 am and 11 00 am on a clear day at 0 daa beginning of anthesis 14 daa middle grain filling stage and 28 daa late grain filling stage the labeling time is subject to the phenological development in wheat under t4 the whole flag leaf

of yields and yield components the grain yield was determined at physiological maturity following harvesting and threshing the area harvested for grain yield was 3 m2 2 m by 1 5 m in the center of each plot prior to grain harvesting a random subsample of 60 ear bearing culms was removed from the plots after counting the number of grains per spike this subsample was oven dried weighed and threshed the grain weight per spike was recorded and a subsample of 1000 grains was used to estimate the 1000 grain weight 2 9 statistical analysis analyses of variance anova were conducted by using spss version 13 0 for windows spss chicago il usa duncan s multiple range tests were performed to test the significant differences between the mean values for treatments p 0 05 for each year or at the same 13c labeling time 3 results 3 1 changes of the soil water content before and after irrigation the soil water content in the 0 20 20 40 and 40 140 cm soil layers was measured at the pre wintering jointing and anthesis stages table 3 the average relative water content arwc in the 0 20 20 40 and 40 140 cm soil layers was 63 7 77 5 50 7 72 7 and 75 7 79 0 before irrigation at the pre wintering stage respectively and was 85 7 97 1 57 3 90 5 and 75 7 81 8 after irrigation at the pre wintering stage under t3 and t5 treatments respectively at the jointing stage the arwc was 25 6 41 7 36 4 52 5 and 66 5 68 7 in the 0 20 20 40 and 40 140 cm soil layers before irrigation under t1 t5 treatments respectively and it was 68 9 84 7 57 5 67 3 and 67 7 71 4 in the 0 20 20 40 and 40 140 cm soil layers after irrigation under t2 t5 treatments respectively the arwc before and after irrigation under t3 and t5 treatments was higher in the 0 20 cm soil layer but lower in the 20 40 and 40 140 cm soil layers than the arwc under t2 and t4 treatments in 2012 2013 and there was no significant difference between them in the 0 20 20 40 and 40 140 cm soil layer in 2013 2014 at the anthesis stage the arwc was 30 6 32 9 27 6 44 3 and 59 6 66 1 in the 0 20 20 40 and 40 140 cm soil layers before irrigation under t1 treatment respectively and it was lower than that under t2 and t3 treatments in both years the arwc was 66 1 71 4 56 5 62 8 and 60 8 71 8 in the 0 20 20 40 and 40 140 cm soil layers after irrigation under t4 treatment respectively and it was 61 7 79 3 46 7 73 7 and 70 0 66 6 in the 0 20 20 40 and 40 140 cm soil layers after irrigation under t5 treatment respectively 3 2 phenology of winter wheat the time taken for phenological development in wheat under different si treatments was recorded at the first node detectable stage beginning of anthesis stage and physiological maturity stage table 4 there were no significant differences among treatments in days to the first node detectable stage t2 t3 t4 and t5 were delayed by 4 5 days in the beginning of anthesis stage compared with t1 there were no significant differences among t2 t3 t4 and t5 t4 and t5 were longer than t2 and t3 and t1 was the shortest in days to maturity of wheat there were no significant differences between t4 and t5 or between t2 and t3 these results indicated that the si at pre wintering cannot change the days to jointing or to anthesis however the growth period of winter wheat was significantly extended by the si at anthesis complete 3 3 yield components grain yield and water use efficiency yield components grain yield and irrigation water use efficiency for yield iwue are shown in table 5 the spike number of t2 t3 t4 and t5 was significantly higher than that of t1 and there was no significant differences between t3 t4 and t5 t2 was higher than t1 but lower than t3 t4 and t5 and there were no significant differences between t4 and t5 in kernels per spike or grain yield t4 and t5 were higher than t1 t2 and t3 and there were no significant differences between t4 and t5 or among t1 t2 and t3 in thousand grain weight the total amount of irrigation was increased significantly while the irrigation water use efficiency for yield gradually reduced from t2 to t5 compared with no irrigation after emergence the increase in production by the single si at jointing was 1490 4 2058 1 kg ha 1 while extra 1279 6 1560 1 kg ha 1 was achieved by a second si at anthesis complete the increase in production by si at the pre wintering stage was 698 3 822 6 kg ha 1 when a second si was supplied at jointing however it was only 142 1 253 2 kg ha 1 when a second and third si were supplied at jointing and anthesis complete the increase in production by the si at anthesis complete based on the si at pre wintering and jointing was only 834 5 879 6 kg ha 1 3 4 dynamics of dry matter accumulation the dry matter amount at different stages of winter wheat are shown in fig 2 t3 and t5 were higher than t1 t2 and t4 at the jointing and anthesis stages t1 was lower than the other treatments at anthesis and maturity t2 was lower than t3 t4 and t5 and there were no significant differences between t3 t4 and t5 at maturity in 2012 2013 t5 was the highest followed by t4 and t3 and then t2 and there was no significant difference between t4 and t3 at maturity in 2013 2014 these results indicated that si at pre wintering jointing or anthesis complete can improve the dry matter amount however the increase in dry matter amount by the si at anthesis complete based on the two si supplied before anthesis was lower than that by the si at anthesis complete based on only one si supplied before anthesis 3 5 photosynthetic rate of flag leaf the photosynthetic rate of flag leaf after anthesis is shown in fig 3 t2 and t4 were higher than t1 but lower than t3 and t5 at 0 daa t5 was the highest from 7 to 28 daa followed by t4 and t3 and then t2 t1 was the lowest there was no significant difference between t4 and t3 from 7 to 14 daa however t4 was significantly higher than t3 from 21 to 28 daa these results indicated that the photosynthetic rate of flag leaf after anthesis was improved by si at jointing on the basis of si at pre wintering and the photosynthetic rate can be increased further if a third si is supplied at anthesis complete 3 6 13c distribution in different organs of winter wheat the 13c distribution proportion in different organs of winter wheat 24 h after labeling and at maturity is shown in table 6 there was a total of 56 32 13c assimilated by flag leaf at 0 daa transported and allocated to the stem plus sheath and 30 12 to the spike axis plus glume with only 13 18 residual in the flag leaf within 24 h at maturity 40 89 31 09 4 50 and 2 19 of total 13c were allocated to the grain stem plus sheath spike axis plus glume and flag leaf respectively compared with the 13c assimilated by flag leaf at 0 daa the distribution proportion of 13c assimilated by flag leaf at 14 daa increased greatly in grain while it decreased markedly in both stem plus sheath and spike axis plus glume and there was no significant change in the flag leaf whether within 24 h after assimilation or at maturity compared with the 13c assimilated by flag leaf at 14 daa the distribution proportion of 13c assimilated by flag leaf at 28 daa decreased significantly in grain but increased greatly in flag leaf and there was no significant change in the stem plus sheath whether on 24 h after assimilation or at maturity the proportion of 13c assimilated by flag leaf at 0 14 and 28 daa transported and allocated to other leaves was quite low and almost equal to zero whether within 24 h after assimilation or at maturity the amount of 13c distribution in different organs of winter wheat under different treatments is shown in table 7 the amount of 13c assimilated by flag leaf at 0 daa and allocated to the ear within 24 h after assimilation and that allocated to grain at maturity under t1 were the highest followed by that under t2 and t4 and then that under t3 and t5 however the amount of 13c assimilated by flag leaf at 0 daa and allocated to stem plus sheath under t3 and t5 were higher than that under t2 t4 and t1 the amount of 13c assimilated by flag leaf at 14 daa and allocated to grain under t5 and t4 were the highest followed by that under t3 t2 and t1 within 24 h after assimilation or at maturity the allocation amount of 13c assimilated by flag leaf at 28 daa in different organs within 24 h after assimilation or at maturity showed the same trend between treatments t5 and t4 were the highest followed by t3 and t2 t1 was the lowest 3 7 dry matter assimilation and redistribution after anthesis the amount of dry matter assimilation dma and redistribution dar after anthesis and their contribution rate to grain are shown in table 8 in 2012 2013 the amount of dma and their contribution rate to grain was the highest under t5 followed by t4 and then t3 t2 and t1 whereas an opposite regularity was detected in the amount of dar and their contribution rate to grain and the harvest index the results in 2013 2014 were almost the same as that in 2012 2013 this indicated that within a certain range with increasing si times dry matter assimilation after anthesis was increased but the dry matter redistribution from vegetative organs to grain was decreased this was the reason why excessive irrigation could not increase the yield 4 discussion based on one dimensional ponding water infiltration in the laboratory the soil infiltration rate decreased with an increase in cohesive particles content and dry density a decrease of initial water content at a low dry density and with an increase of initial water content at a high dry density wu and zhang 2010 liu et al 2012 the loam soil as expected had a higher infiltration rate than clay soil zhang et al 2016 however during the initial rain application for each event cracks in the clay soil resulted in very high infiltration rates and once the cracks sealed the clay infiltration rates decreased dramatically suarez et al 2006 in an alluvial clay soil the mean infiltrated water depth along a furrow was 120 mm by applying a 2 1 m3 h inflow rate for dry furrow as 316 2 m3 ha water was applied per irrigation the maximum infiltrated depth was 134 9 mm occurring at the upstream end and the minimum infiltrated depth was recorded as 97 3 mm occurring at the downstream end amer 2011 the infiltration depths were approximately 150 cm for both severe saline alkali and mild saline alkali fields in an arid region han and zhou 2018 in this study approximately 55 4 61 9 and 33 0 44 6 irrigation water was stored in the 0 20 cm and 20 40 cm soil layer 3 days after irrigation respectively while 18 2 28 8 mm water was supplied at the pre wintering stage of winter wheat tables 2 and 3 as 46 7 60 4 mm water was supplied at the jointing stage of wheat approximately 63 0 72 4 and 24 9 34 9 irrigation water was stored in the 0 20 cm and 20 40 cm soil layer respectively at anthesis approximately 55 2 63 0 and 34 9 41 4 irrigation water was stored in the 0 20 cm and 20 40 cm soil layer respectively when 44 1 55 7 mm water supplied these results indicated that si brought the soil water content in the 0 20 cm profile to 100 field capacity at the pre wintering jointing and anthesis complete stages of wheat mainly by improving the water supply condition in the 0 40 cm soil layer in the silty loam wheat field in the huang huai hai plain of china drought stress at any growth stage of wheat induces decreasing grain yield and sensitivity for stress is highest in the stem elongation stage than in other growth stages mirzaei et al 2011 saeidi et al 2015 drought stress during maturity results in an approximately 10 decrease in yield while moderate stress during the early vegetative period has essentially no effect on yield bauder 2001 in comparison with stress at the boot stage grain yield decreases to a greater extent when water stress is imposed at the anthesis stage gupta et al 2001 dalvandi et al 2013 in this study the relative soil water content in the 0 20 cm soil layer was higher 63 7 77 5 at pre wintering but lower 25 6 43 9 at jointing and anthesis table 3 therefore wheat is vulnerable to drought stress in the later growth stages si at jointing and anthesis is the main way to meet the water demands for the growth development and yield formation of winter wheat wang 2017 the results of this study indicated that compared with no irrigation after emergence si at jointing and anthesis complete significantly increased grain yield by increasing the spike number kernel number and grain weight table 5 the increase rate of production by si at jointing was the highest followed by si at anthesis complete si at the pre wintering stage can improve the grain number and yield under the condition of no si at anthesis complete but has no significant effect on the grain yield when si is supplied at jointing and anthesis complete and even worse the irrigation water use efficiency decreased grain yield of wheat is dependent on assimilates produced by current photosynthesis in the postanthesis period postanthesis carbohydrates stored temporarily in vegetative organs before being retranslocated to the grain and assimilates translocated from stored carbohydrates in the vegetative plant parts produced during the preanthesis period regan et al 1993 dalvandi et al 2013 the photosynthetic rate of flag leaf after anthesis can be improved by si at jointing on the basis of si at the pre wintering stage and it increases further as a third si is supplied at anthesis complete fig 3 the ability to effectively translocate assimilates from stems and leaves to the developing grain is desirable for maximizing grain yield production in water limited environments turner and begg 1981 the results of this study revealed that most of photosynthates produced by flag leaf in early flowering stage were stored in the stem plus sheath approximately 56 and then retranslocated to the grain during grain filling table 6 the harvest index of these photosynthates was only approximately 41 approximately 69 of photosynthates produced by flag leaf in the middle grain filling stage were translocated to grain within 24 h but few photosynthates were retranslocated from vegetative organs to grain in the late grain filling stage the proportion of photosynthates translocated from leaf to grain within 24 h after assimilation was slightly reduced and the proportion of photosynthates retranslocated from vegetative organs to grain was slightly increased these results indicated that the distribution and redistribution of photosynthates produced by leaves in the early flowering stage should be one of the important limiting factors for increasing the photosynthates harvest index and grain yield the results of this study also indicated that a decrease in water supply before anthesis complete significantly reduced the dry matter accumulation and photosynthetic rate at anthesis figs 2 and 3 but promoted the translocation of photosynthates to the ear table 7 si at anthesis complete is advantageous to the assimilation of carbohydrates in the middle and late grain filling stage and the distribution of those carbohydrates from vegetative organs to grain therefore the moderate dry matter accumulation and water deficit in the early flowering stage and the moderate water supply in the grain filling stage may be conducive to coordinating the relationship between photosynthesis and photosynthates retranslocated after anthesis and to improving the harvest index grain yield and water use efficiency 5 conclusion water resources are increasingly scarce and droughts are frequent in the huang huai hai plain of china si is the main way to maintain food supplies and conserve water in this region in this study si brought the soil water content in the 0 20 cm profile to 100 field capacity at the pre wintering jointing and anthesis complete stages of winter wheat mainly improving the water supply condition in the 0 40 cm soil layer in the silty loam soil compared with no irrigation after emergence si at jointing and anthesis complete significantly increased grain yield by increasing the spike number kernel number and grain weight si at the pre wintering stage can improve grain number and yield under the condition of no si at anthesis complete but had no significant effect on the grain yield when si was supplied at jointing and anthesis complete and even worse the irrigation water use efficiency decreased this was related to excessive irrigation restricting the distribution of photosynthates from vegetative organs to grain si at jointing and anthesis complete was conducive to coordinating the relationship between photosynthesis and photosynthates retranslocated after anthesis and to improving the harvest index grain yield and water use efficiency acknowledgements this work was supported by the special fund for agro scientific research in the

11146,water resources are increasingly scarce and droughts are frequent in the huang huai hai plain of china there is an urgent need for developing water saving technologies for winter wheat production in this region field experiments were carried out in silty loam soil from 2012 to 2014 based on the same water condition in seeding period and the normal emergence of winter wheat five supplemental irrigation si regimes differing in the timing of si were established crop development was categorized using the zadoks scale t1 no irrigation after emergence t2 si at jointing 4th node detectable z34 t3 si at pre wintering average daily temperature drops to about 2 and the wheat plant basically stops growing and jointing t4 si at jointing and anthesis complete z69 t5 si at pre wintering jointing and anthesis complete the results showed that si brought the soil water content in the 0 20 cm profile to 100 field capacity at the pre wintering jointing and anthesis complete stages of winter wheat mainly improving the water supply condition in the 0 40 cm soil layer compared with no irrigation after emergence si at jointing and anthesis complete significantly increased grain yield by increasing the spike number kernel number and grain weight si at the pre wintering stage can improve grain number and yield under the condition of no si at anthesis complete comparing t3 with t2 but had no significant effect on grain yield when si was supplied at jointing and anthesis complete comparing t5 with t4 and even worse the irrigation water use efficiency decreased the decrease of water supply before anthesis complete significantly reduced the dry matter accumulation and photosynthetic rate at anthesis but promoted the translocation of photosynthates to the plant ear si at anthesis complete is advantageous for the assimilation of carbohydrates in the middle and late grain filling stage and for the distribution of those carbohydrates from vegetative organs to grain these results indicated that si at jointing and anthesis complete was conducive to coordinating the relationship between photosynthesis and photosynthates retranslocated after anthesis and may improve the harvest index grain yield and water use efficiency keywords winter wheat supplemental irrigation 13c photosynthate accumulation and transportation dry matter water use efficiency 1 introduction the huang huai hai plain is the main wheat triticum aestivum l producing area in china the planting area of wheat in this region is more than 60 of the total national planting area national bureau of statistics of china 2017 however the water resources are increasingly scarce and droughts are frequent in this region kang and zhang 2016 these adverse factors are seriously threatening wheat production food security and water security therefore the invention of effective irrigation techniques is crucial to maintaining high yields of winter wheat through improved water use efficiency wue water stress during grain filling reduces photosynthesis induces early senescence and shortens the grain filling period yang and zhang 2005 carbohydrates supporting the increase in grain dry weights during grain filling are derived from two sources 1 current photoassimilation and 2 stored carbohydrate reserves in vegetative organs gebbing et al 1999 wang et al 2012 the fractional distribution of the 14c remaining at maturity varied with labeling date and cultivar the fraction of 14c in the spike was 0 35 to 0 5 when labeled at the heading with less than 0 15 in the grain when labeled during grain filling a greater fraction of 14c was distributed to the spike in the semi dwarf cultivars than the tall cultivars at 0 9 and 0 8 respectively and most of the 14c in the spike was in the grain gent and kiyomoto 1989 under dry field conditions the apparent contribution of stored carbohydrate reserves could be 75 100 of the grain yield in wheat compared with 37 39 under high rainfall conditions van herwaarden et al 1998 although postanthesis water deficits increased the contributions of preanthesis c to the grain significantly decreased the postanthesis assimilation palta et al 1994 total non structural carbohydrates concentration in the stems was increased during the 6 days from anthesis yang et al 2004 which seems to indicate that supply of carbohydrates is not the limiting factor of grain yield formation in early stage of wheat grain development there is close association between photoassimilates partitioning to the grain during anthesis to 16 days after anthesis and individual grain weight joudi 2017 therefore we may assume that on the basis of maintaining a certain amount of dry matter accumulation in vegetative organs before anthesis the grain filling rate should be accelerated by adjusting the soil moisture to moderate deficit in early stage of wheat grain development and then inducing more current photoassimilates to transport into grains rather than to remain in vegetative organs so as to further improve the harvest index and tap the potential of increasing grain weight it has been demonstrated that supplemental irrigation si delayed from the beginning of anthesis to the completion of anthesis increases the partitioning of 14c assimilated by flag leaf at the boot stage to grains at maturity lin et al 2016 based on the previous research this paper established five si regimes differing in the timing of si to explore ways that accelerates photoassimilates transport to grains by reducing times of si before anthesis 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site field experiments were conducted from october 2012 to june 2014 in shijiawangzi village yanzhou 116 41 e 35 40 n which is located in the center of the huang huai hai plain of china and its environment is representative of the plain the soil of the experimental field was silty loam and the previous crop was corn

2012 2013 and 2013 2014 respectively the monthly climatic conditions rainfall and temperature of the experimental site during the wheat growing season from october 2012 to june 2014 are shown in fig 1 2 2 experimental design based on the same soil moisture regulation of sowing to ensure the normal emergence of the winter wheat five irrigation treatments were applied t1 t2 t3 t4 and t5 differing in the timing of si as shown in table 2 crop development was categorized using the zadoks scale zadoks et al 1974 the t1 treatment was rainfed no irrigation after emergence in the t2 treatment si was applied at the jointing 4th node detectable z34 stage in the t3 treatment si was applied at the pre wintering average daily temperature drops to about 2 and the wheat plant basically stops growing and jointing z34 stages in the t4 treatment si was applied at the jointing z34 and anthesis complete z69 stages in the t5 treatment si was applied at the pre wintering jointing z34 and anthesis complete z69 stages the amount of si was calculated from the relative water content in the 0 20 cm soil layer using the methods of wang et al 2013 the target relative water content in the 0 20 cm soil layer after si was 100 field capacity the amount of si under different treatments and the changes of the average relative water content at different depths of the soil layers before and after irrigation are shown in tables 2 and 3 respectively water was sprayed evenly onto the experimental plots under pressure a flow meter was used to measure the amount of water applied each experimental plot was 4 8 m2 in size and replicated thrice in randomized block designs between the two adjacent irrigation plots a 1 5 m wide unirrigated zone was maintained to minimize the effects of adjacent plots 2 3 crop management all plots were supplied with 105 kg of n ha 1 150 kg of p2o5 ha 1 and 150 kg of k2o ha 1 at the time of seeding and 135 kg of n ha 1 at the jointing stage the high yielding wheat triticum aestivum l cultivar jimai22 was used in these experiments wheat seeds were sown at a density of 180 plants m 2 on october 10 and october 9 in 2012 and 2013 respectively the wheat was harvested on june

remobilization after anthesis the assimilate production after anthesis and the apparent remobilization of preanthesis stored assimilates were calculated according to papakosta and gagianas 1991 the apparent remobilization of preanthesis stored assimilates kg ha 1 was calculated as the dry matter of aerial plant parts at anthesis kg ha 1 minus the dry matter of leaves stems sheaths stalk and glume at maturity kg ha 1 the assimilate production after anthesis kg ha 1 was calculated as the grain weight kg ha 1 minus the apparent remobilization of preanthesis stored assimilates kg ha 1 the proportion of grain yield derived from remobilization was calculated as the apparent remobilization of preanthesis stored assimilates divided by the grain weight for these estimates it was assumed that all of the dry matter lost from vegetative plant parts was remobilized into the grain losses of dry matter due to plant respiration during grain ﬁlling were not considered 2 7 stable carbon isotope 13c labeling of assimilates in 2012 2013 flag leaves from 20 stems that blooms on the same day per plot were chosen at random and labeled with 13co2 between 9 00 am and 11 00 am on a clear day

of yields and yield components the grain yield was determined at physiological maturity following harvesting and threshing the area harvested for grain yield was 3 m2 2 m by 1 5 m in the center of each plot prior to grain harvesting a random subsample of 60 ear bearing culms was removed from the plots after counting the number of grains per spike this subsample was oven dried weighed and threshed the grain weight per spike was recorded and a subsample of 1000 grains was used to estimate the 1000 grain weight 2 9 statistical analysis analyses of variance anova were conducted by using

same 13c labeling time 3 results 3 1 changes of the soil water content before and after irrigation the soil water content in the 0 20 20 40 and 40 140 cm soil layers was measured at the pre wintering jointing and anthesis stages table 3 the average relative water content arwc in the 0 20 20 40 and 40 140 cm soil layers was 63 7 77 5 50 7 72 7 and 75 7 79 0 before irrigation at the pre wintering stage respectively and was 85 7 97 1 57 3 90 5 and 75 7 81 8 after irrigation at the pre wintering stage under t3 and t5 treatments respectively at the jointing stage the arwc was 25 6 41 7 36 4 52 5 and 66 5 68 7 in the 0 20 20 40 and 40 140 cm soil layers before irrigation under t1 t5 treatments respectively and it was 68 9 84 7 57 5 67 3 and 67 7 71 4 in the 0 20 20 40 and 40 140 cm soil layers after irrigation under t2 t5 treatments respectively the arwc before and after irrigation under t3 and t5 treatments was higher in the 0 20 cm soil layer but lower in the 20 40 and 40 140 cm soil layers than the arwc under t2 and t4 treatments in 2012 2013 and there was no significant difference between them in the 0 20 20 40 and 40 140 cm soil layer in 2013 2014 at the anthesis stage the arwc was 30 6 32 9 27 6 44 3 and 59 6 66 1 in the 0 20 20 40 and 40 140 cm soil layers before irrigation under t1 treatment respectively and it was lower than that under t2 and t3 treatments in both years the arwc was 66 1 71 4 56 5 62 8 and 60 8 71 8 in the 0 20 20 40 and 40 140 cm soil layers after irrigation under t4 treatment respectively and it was 61 7 79 3 46 7 73 7 and 70 0 66 6 in the 0 20 20 40 and 40 140 cm soil layers after irrigation under t5 treatment respectively 3 2 phenology of winter wheat the time taken for phenological development in wheat under different si treatments was recorded at the first node detectable stage beginning of anthesis stage and physiological maturity stage table 4 there were no significant differences among treatments in days to the first node detectable stage t2 t3 t4 and t5 were delayed by 4 5 days in the beginning of anthesis stage compared with t1 there were no significant differences among t2 t3 t4 and t5 t4 and t5 were longer than t2 and t3 and t1 was the shortest in days to maturity of wheat there were no significant differences between t4 and t5 or between t2 and t3 these results indicated that the si at pre wintering cannot change the days to jointing or to anthesis however the growth period of winter wheat was significantly extended by the si at anthesis complete 3 3 yield components grain yield and water use efficiency yield components grain yield and irrigation water use efficiency for yield iwue are shown in table 5 the spike number of t2 t3 t4 and t5 was significantly higher than that of t1 and there was no significant differences between t3 t4 and t5 t2 was higher than t1 but lower than t3 t4 and t5 and there were no significant differences between t4 and t5 in kernels per spike or grain yield t4 and t5 were higher than t1 t2 and t3 and there were no significant differences between t4 and t5 or among t1 t2 and t3 in thousand grain weight the total amount of irrigation was increased significantly while the irrigation water use efficiency for yield gradually reduced from t2 to t5 compared with no irrigation after emergence the increase in production by the single si at jointing was 1490 4 2058 1 kg ha 1 while extra 1279 6 1560 1 kg ha 1 was achieved by a second si at anthesis complete the increase in production by si at the pre wintering stage was 698 3 822 6 kg ha 1 when a second si was supplied at jointing however it was only 142 1 253 2 kg ha 1 when a second and third si were supplied at jointing and anthesis complete the increase in production by the si at anthesis complete based on the si at pre wintering and jointing was only 834 5 879 6 kg ha 1 3 4 dynamics of dry matter accumulation the dry matter amount at different stages of winter wheat are shown in fig 2 t3 and t5 were higher than t1 t2 and t4 at the jointing and anthesis stages t1 was lower than the other treatments at anthesis and maturity t2 was lower than t3 t4 and t5 and there were no significant differences between t3 t4 and t5 at maturity in 2012 2013 t5 was the highest followed by t4 and t3 and then t2 and there was no significant difference between t4 and t3 at maturity in 2013 2014 these results indicated that si at pre wintering jointing or anthesis complete can improve the dry matter amount however the increase in dry matter amount by the si at anthesis complete based on the two si supplied before anthesis was lower than that by the si at anthesis complete based on only one si supplied before anthesis 3 5 photosynthetic rate of flag leaf the photosynthetic rate of flag leaf after anthesis is shown in fig 3 t2 and t4 were higher than t1 but lower than t3 and t5 at 0 daa t5 was the highest from 7 to 28 daa followed by t4 and t3 and then t2 t1 was the lowest there was no significant difference between t4 and t3 from 7 to 14 daa however t4 was significantly higher than t3 from 21 to 28 daa these results indicated that the photosynthetic rate of flag leaf after anthesis was improved by si at jointing on the basis of si at pre wintering and the photosynthetic rate can be increased further if a third si is supplied at anthesis complete 3 6 13c distribution in different organs of winter wheat the 13c distribution proportion in different organs of winter wheat 24 h after labeling and at maturity is shown in table 6 there was a total of 56 32 13c assimilated by flag leaf at 0 daa transported and allocated to the stem plus sheath and 30 12 to the spike axis plus glume with only 13 18 residual in the flag leaf within 24 h at maturity 40 89 31 09 4 50 and 2 19 of total 13c were allocated to the grain stem plus sheath spike axis plus glume and flag leaf respectively compared with the 13c assimilated by flag leaf at 0 daa the distribution proportion of 13c assimilated by flag leaf at 14 daa increased greatly in grain while it decreased markedly in both stem plus sheath and spike axis plus glume and there was no significant change in the flag leaf whether within 24 h after assimilation or at maturity compared with the 13c assimilated by flag leaf at 14 daa the distribution proportion of 13c assimilated by flag leaf at 28 daa decreased significantly in grain but increased greatly in flag leaf and there was no significant change in the stem plus sheath whether on 24 h after assimilation or at maturity the proportion of 13c assimilated by flag leaf at 0 14 and 28 daa transported and allocated to other leaves was quite low and almost equal to zero whether within 24 h after assimilation or at maturity the amount of 13c distribution in different organs of winter wheat under different treatments is shown in table 7 the amount of 13c assimilated by flag leaf at 0 daa and allocated to the ear within 24 h after assimilation and that allocated to grain at maturity under t1 were the highest followed by that under t2 and t4 and then that under t3 and t5 however the amount of 13c assimilated by flag leaf at 0 daa and allocated to stem plus sheath under t3 and t5 were higher than that under t2 t4 and t1 the amount of 13c assimilated by flag leaf at 14 daa and allocated to grain under t5 and t4 were the highest followed by that under t3 t2 and t1 within 24 h after assimilation or at maturity the allocation amount of 13c assimilated by flag leaf at 28 daa in different organs within 24 h after assimilation or at maturity showed the same trend between treatments t5 and t4 were the highest followed by t3 and t2 t1 was the lowest 3 7 dry matter assimilation and redistribution after anthesis the amount of dry matter assimilation dma and redistribution dar after anthesis and their contribution rate to grain are shown in table 8 in 2012 2013 the amount of dma and their contribution rate to grain was the highest under t5 followed by t4 and then t3 t2 and t1 whereas an opposite regularity was detected in the amount of dar and their contribution rate to grain and the harvest index the results in 2013 2014 were almost the same as that in 2012 2013 this indicated that within a certain range with increasing si times dry matter assimilation after anthesis was increased but the dry matter redistribution from vegetative organs to grain was decreased this was the reason why excessive irrigation could not increase the yield 4 discussion based on one dimensional ponding water infiltration in the laboratory the soil infiltration rate decreased with an increase in cohesive particles content and dry density a decrease of initial water content at a low dry density and with an increase of initial water content at a high dry density wu and zhang 2010 liu et al 2012 the loam soil as expected had a higher infiltration rate than clay soil zhang et al 2016 however during the initial rain application for each event cracks in the clay soil resulted in very high infiltration rates and once the cracks sealed the clay infiltration rates decreased dramatically suarez et al 2006 in an alluvial clay soil the mean infiltrated water depth along a furrow was 120 mm by applying a 2 1 m3 h inflow rate for dry furrow as 316 2 m3 ha water was applied per irrigation the maximum infiltrated depth was 134 9 mm occurring at the upstream end and the minimum infiltrated depth was recorded as 97 3 mm occurring at the downstream end amer 2011 the infiltration depths were approximately 150 cm for both severe saline alkali and mild saline alkali fields in an arid region han and zhou 2018 in this study approximately 55 4 61 9 and 33 0 44 6 irrigation water was stored in the 0 20 cm and 20 40 cm soil layer 3 days after irrigation respectively while 18 2 28 8 mm water was supplied at the pre wintering stage of winter wheat tables 2 and 3 as 46 7 60 4 mm water was supplied at the jointing stage of wheat approximately 63 0 72 4 and 24 9 34 9 irrigation water was stored in the 0 20 cm and 20 40 cm soil layer respectively at anthesis approximately 55 2 63 0 and 34 9 41 4 irrigation water was stored in the 0 20 cm and 20 40 cm soil layer respectively when 44 1 55 7 mm water supplied these results indicated that si brought the soil water content in the 0 20 cm profile to 100 field capacity at the pre wintering jointing and anthesis complete stages of wheat mainly by improving the water supply condition in the 0 40 cm soil layer in the silty loam wheat field in the huang huai hai plain of china drought stress at any growth stage of wheat induces decreasing grain yield and sensitivity for stress is highest in the stem elongation stage than in other growth stages mirzaei et al 2011 saeidi et al 2015 drought stress during maturity results in an approximately 10 decrease in yield while moderate stress during the early vegetative period has essentially no effect on yield bauder 2001 in comparison with stress at the boot stage grain yield decreases to a greater extent when water stress is imposed at the anthesis stage gupta et al 2001 dalvandi et al 2013 in this study the relative soil water content in the 0 20 cm soil layer was higher 63 7 77 5 at pre wintering but lower 25 6 43 9 at jointing and anthesis table 3 therefore wheat is vulnerable to drought stress in the later growth stages si at jointing and anthesis is the main way to meet the water demands for the growth development and yield formation of winter wheat wang 2017 the results of this study indicated that compared with no irrigation after emergence si at jointing and anthesis complete significantly increased grain yield by increasing the spike number kernel number and grain weight table 5 the increase rate of production by si at jointing was the highest followed by si at anthesis complete si at the pre wintering stage can improve the grain number and yield under the condition of no si at anthesis complete but has no significant effect on the grain yield when si is supplied at jointing and anthesis complete and even worse the irrigation water use efficiency decreased grain yield of wheat is dependent on assimilates produced by current photosynthesis in the postanthesis period postanthesis carbohydrates stored temporarily in vegetative organs before being retranslocated to the grain and assimilates translocated from stored carbohydrates in the vegetative plant parts produced during the preanthesis period regan et al 1993 dalvandi et al 2013 the photosynthetic rate of flag leaf after anthesis can be improved by si at jointing on the basis of si at the pre wintering stage and it increases further as a third si is supplied at anthesis complete fig 3 the ability to effectively translocate assimilates from stems and leaves to the developing grain is desirable for maximizing grain yield production in water limited environments turner and begg 1981 the results of this study revealed that most of photosynthates produced by flag leaf in early flowering stage were stored in the stem plus sheath approximately 56 and then retranslocated to the grain during grain filling table 6 the harvest index of these photosynthates was only approximately 41 approximately 69 of photosynthates produced by flag leaf in the middle grain filling stage were translocated to grain within 24 h but few photosynthates were retranslocated from vegetative organs to grain in the late grain filling stage the proportion of photosynthates translocated from leaf to grain within 24 h after assimilation was slightly reduced and the proportion of photosynthates retranslocated from vegetative organs to grain was slightly increased these results indicated that the distribution and redistribution of photosynthates produced by leaves in the early flowering stage should be one of the important limiting factors for increasing the photosynthates harvest index and grain yield the results of this study also indicated that a decrease in water supply before anthesis complete significantly reduced the dry matter accumulation and photosynthetic rate at anthesis figs 2 and 3 but promoted the translocation of photosynthates to the ear table 7 si at anthesis complete is advantageous to the assimilation of carbohydrates in the middle and late grain filling stage and the distribution of those carbohydrates from vegetative organs to grain therefore the moderate dry matter accumulation and water deficit in the early flowering stage and the moderate water supply in the grain filling stage may be conducive to coordinating the relationship between photosynthesis and photosynthates retranslocated after anthesis and to improving the harvest index grain yield and water use efficiency 5 conclusion water resources are increasingly scarce and droughts are frequent in the huang huai hai plain of china si is the main way to maintain food supplies and conserve water in this region in this study si brought the soil water content in the 0 20 cm profile to 100 field capacity at the pre wintering jointing and anthesis complete stages of winter wheat mainly improving the water supply condition in the 0 40 cm soil layer in the silty loam soil compared with no irrigation after emergence si at jointing and anthesis complete significantly increased grain yield by increasing the spike number kernel number and grain weight si at the pre wintering stage can improve grain number and yield under the condition of no si at anthesis complete but had no significant effect on the grain yield when si was supplied at jointing and anthesis complete and even worse the irrigation water use efficiency decreased this was related to excessive irrigation restricting the distribution of photosynthates from vegetative organs to grain si at jointing and anthesis complete was conducive to coordinating the relationship between photosynthesis and photosynthates retranslocated after anthesis and to improving the harvest index grain yield and water use efficiency acknowledgements this work was supported by the special fund for agro scientific research in the

the relative importance of each component to aquifer recharge is site specific and depends upon irrigation method soil type and geologic materials which can influence canal loss and vertical

infiltration rates based upon crop use and irrigation method kuzara et al 2012 calculated infiltration rates in the stillwater valley based on chloride mass balance although the reported rates used different units and timeframes recharge from applied irrigation was 1 8 to 5 3 times greater than recharge from canal leakage except in the gallatin valley where it was 1 5 times less gallatin valley differed from the other modeled areas in that it has a high percentage of acres under pivot sprinkler irrigation and a high density of irrigation canals through the model calibration process initial irrigation infiltration rates were reduced in all models a groundwater model of the agricultural chilean peumo valley which has extensive canal construction also used irrigation method efficiency as an approximation for irrigation loss recharge arumi et al 2009 this model calculated the primary source of groundwater recharge was through canal seepage 52 percent with irrigation loss and precipitation making up the balance 22 and 26 percent respectively arumi et al 2009 previous work on the bighorn river valley found the majority of recharge was through canal leakage based on chloride and stable isotope analysis evidence that is supported by a steep potentiometric surface along the western irrigation canal showing groundwater flow away from the canal meredith et al 2009 however in contrast to the gallatin river valley and the peumo valley the bighorn river valley has few sprinkler irrigation systems and only two major irrigation canals the goals of this work are to evaluate the accuracy of assumed infiltration rates based on irrigation method and help direct conservation efforts through improved understanding of the relative importance of two irrigation related recharge pathways in alluvial groundwater availability canal leakage and infiltration from applied irrigation water 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site description the alluvial gravel aquifer of the bighorn river valley north of hardin montana fig 1 is approximately 4 6 m thick throughout the valley but locally thins to less than 1 5 m near the river gwic 2016 the gravel aquifer overlies the cretaceous formations from the bearpaw shale youngest to the niobrara shale oldest vuke et al 2000 thin sandstones of the cretaceous judith river formation underlie the aquifer in the middle of the study area however well records indicate it is not widely used as an aquifer gwic 2016 vuke et al 2000 a layer of clay and sandy clay ranging in thickness from more than 12 m near the western edge of the valley to absent along the river overlies the gravel aquifer these fine grained deposits are eroded in places by ephemeral drainages recorded water levels in some wells are above the top of the gravel aquifer indicating confined conditions in much of the aquifer the land use is agricultural cropland a typical crop rotation includes two years of small grains barley spring wheat or winter wheat and one year of sugar beets in any given year roughly one third of the acreage is cultivated with sugar beets and the remaining two thirds is in small grain secondary crops include corn and alfalfa personal communication even vanorder us natural resources conservation service nrcs august 2016 the two leggins and low line canals transport irrigation water diverted from the bighorn river along the western edge and center of the valley fig 2 the two leggins canal conveys approximately 730 000 m3d 1 and the low line canal generally less than 240 000 m3d 1 the two leggins canal hugs the western edge of the valley and crosses a mixture of bedrock clay deposits and ephemeral drainages most irrigators flood irrigate fields using gated pipe or siphons from small side canals feeder ditches this network of small feeder ditches both natural ephemeral drainages and constructed drains crisscross the valley often serving a dual purpose of providing irrigation water as well as draining excess water from the fields which prevents water logging the ground surface the alluvial groundwater moves generally from south to north and west to the east meredith et al 2009 aside from the small urban area of hardin approximately 250 ha the land use and hydrogeology south of the study area is similar to that in the study area the two leggins canal drives the west to east component of the groundwater flow the potentiometric surface meredith et al 2009 shows a steep groundwater gradient away from the two leggins canal and indicates the bighorn river gains along study area s reach within this report groundwater wells are referred to by their ground water information center identification number gwic 2016 2 2 water budget components and assumptions 2 2 1 groundwater inflow flow from the south average monthly water levels measured in well 279 512 fig 1 defined groundwater head at the southern model boundary canal leakage measured loss gain rates from 1 6 km reaches at two locations on each of the two leggins and low line canals were used as starting points in the calibration process precipitation five percent of average monthly precipitation rates western regional climate center 2016 average annual precipitation is 30 cm was added as recharge to the entire model area as a starting point for the calibration process irrigation infiltration vertical infiltration from irrigation was evident in some hydrographs but peaks associated with irrigation applications were small compared to the annual cycle associated with canal leakage e g wells 239730 236086 and 259285 on fig 1 recharge from irrigation infiltration was estimated through trial and error matching the model results to peaks in the hydrograph from flood irrigation application for one hydrograph well 236086 that rate was then applied to the entire model and revised during the calibration process groundwater modeling software does not simulate the hydrologic cycle rather only accounts for water that enters and leaves the groundwater volume therefore applied irrigation water that runs off the surface or through the soil to drains or is evapotransipired was not included in the model s calculations the difference between the volume of water applied to the surface through irrigation and the volume of water calculated to recharge the groundwater likely leaves the model area through these processes 2 2 2 groundwater outflow flow to the north well 156833 defines groundwater head at the northern border discharge to the river bighorn river flows were measured to define gain or loss across the study area however changes were below measurement threshold discharge to drains drains were mapped using google earth imagery and conductance values a model term to describe amount of water entering the drain chosen from the literature southerland et al 2014 drain elevations and lengths which control the amount of water they carry were estimated from aerial photographs discharge to wells there are approximately 116 domestic wells in the project area gwic 2016 the groundwater chemistry prevents its use for irrigation therefore the only well use is domestic the standard assumption is that a domestic well diverts 1 m3d 1 and consumes 10 percent water policy interim committee 2012 the consumption from domestic wells 11 6 m3d 1 or 4234 m3y 1 is less than 1 percent of the measured loss from the two leggins canal and was therefore not included in model calculations 2 2 3 change in storage the difference between inputs and outputs is the change in storage for the purposes of this model we focused on annual changes in storage water level fluctuations but excluded long term climate change 2 3 groundwater levels the potentiometric surface and annual water level fluctuations were the primary calibration targets ten unvented water level loggers and one barometer to correct for barometric effects measured water levels hourly from spring 2014 through fall 2016 water levels were verified approximately quarterly using a handheld electronic sounder the network of instrumented wells covered the east west and north south extents of the study area fig 1 all water level data are available on the ground water information center database gwic 2016 2 4 canal and river flow measurements canal and river flow rates were measured at bridges using a teledyne river surveyor acoustic doppler current profiler acdp flow rates were measured at each location at least 10 times and until replications were within 5 percent error as much as possible canal measurements were at times of minimal diversions to fields however we could not always visually verify diversions from public right of ways flow rates were measured in july and september of 2015 2 5 groundwater model construction and calibration a numeric computer model representing approximately 24 km by 6 km of the alluvial valley was constructed in groundwater modeling system gms 10 1 aquaveo that uses modflow 2005 as a platform modflow is a finite difference three dimensional grid flow model created by the united states geological survey harbaugh 2005 mcdonald and harbaugh 1988 the two leggins canal bounding the model on the west and the north and south model boundaries were defined as general head boundaries to model flux across the boundary proportional to the difference in head the bighorn river bounding the model on the east is defined as a river to simulate head dependent flux that follows river stage blais 2017 published well information including groundwater elevations total depths and lithology from 48 water wells in the model area defined the model stratigraphy gwic 2016 irrigation canals in this area carry water from april through september outside of this timeframe canal conductance was set to zero to indicate no potential for recharge however the canals were allowed to act as drains year round so groundwater could leave the aquifer through these conduits small drains both natural ephemeral drainages and constructed drains were added to the model where they could be visually identified in aerial photographs drain lengths vary from 1200 to 6000 m the model s initial conditions were the potentiometric heads measured in april 2014 just before the irrigation season began a two layer three dimensional grid represented the alluvial upper layer and a shale bottom layer the rectangular grid frame was 61 m by 244 m cells 115 cells in the x direction 97 cells in the y direction the thickness z direction of the upper layer was defined by the well head elevation and alluvial thickness from drilling information from 48 wells in the study area gwic 2016 the thickness of the shale bottom layer was a constant 122 m superimposed upon the upper alluvial layer were two polygons one covering the majority of the valley the alluvium polygon and a narrow polygon equivalent to the current floodplain the river gravel polygon the polygons were used to assign different aquifer parameters to the cells within the model the model accounts for the role of the overlying clay layer by using aquifer parameters consistent with confined conditions if warranted water levels in the 10 monitored wells became calibration targets the average groundwater levels in april 2014 were the calibration targets for the steady state model modelers used parameter estimation pest 13 0 developed by watermark numerical computing software and manually adjusted hydraulic parameters within published values until modeled water levels matched measured values table 1 within 1 5 m in most locations pest software begins with an initial set of hydrogeologic parameters defined by the modeler from field measurements or published values and iterates combinations of these values within ranges established by the modeler the iteration process is considered complete when the error between modeled and measured water levels has been minimized anderson et al 2015 welter et al 2015 starting hydraulic conductivity values were taken from the results of two published aquifer pumping tests performed in 2007 meredith et al 2009 the measured hydraulic conductivity near the river well 239729 63 m d 1 was applied to the river gravel polygon measured hydraulic conductivity by the canal well 239730 19 m d 1 was applied to the alluvium polygon through the calibration process the hydraulic conductivity of the alluvium polygon was lowered to 15 m d 1 but the river gravel polygon was held at 63 m d 1 the final modeled hydraulic conductivities and specific storage for the alluvium polygon are near the low end of the published values table 1 the specific yield and porosity for the alluvium and river gravel polygons are within published ranges through pest calibration the percent precipitation that was included as recharge was lowered from five to one percent of the average monthly precipitation after calibration the model was validated by running a transient time series model and verifying the magnitude and timing of modeled water level changes matched the 32 months of recorded water levels from monitored wells within a 1 5 m tolerance sensitivity analysis showed that specific storage played a key role in matching modeled water levels to groundwater response to the activation in the spring and shut down in the fall of the two leggins canal calibration targets are evaluated quantitatively and qualitatively but there are no industry guidelines for acceptable magnitude of error anderson et al 2015 the model was considered well calibrated when 1 the modeled potentiometric surface matched a hand drawn surface based on 82 measured water levels to within 1 5 m figs 1 and 2 modeled hydrographs amplitude and timing matched measured groundwater behavior the calibration target of 1 5 m was chosen because it represents less than 5 percent of the approximately 40 m of head change from the south model boundary to the north model boundary nine out of ten calibration targets fell within 1 5 m of the observed water levels and charting observed versus modeled results has a slope 1 0156 excluding well 156833 indicating the model provides a good fit to measured water levels fig 2 modeled water levels at the calibration target at the northern end of the model well 156833 did not match observed values the exact cause is unknown but likely relates to a narrowing valley and a corresponding reduction of aquifer volume 3 results and discussion 3 1 model water budget canals supply recharge water during the months they are active usually april through september or early october irrigation water is applied periodically to fields through this same timeframe the rate of canal loss is dependent upon the difference in head between the canal and the groundwater so as the difference becomes less the leakage rate reduces the total input and output of each budget component was summed over the 2015 calendar year to compare all the inputs and outputs values are presented on table 2 as a yearly total the south to north component of the groundwater flow is much smaller than west to east as shown by the small volume of water crossing the southern and northern boundaries as compared to water leaving and entering along the west two leggins canal and east big horn river boundaries and through canals and drains table 2 most of the water moving through the aquifer originates from the application of irrigation water and leakage from the two leggins canal the big horn river also contributes water to the highly conductive river gravel polygon water moves out of the aquifer through the low line canal and to smaller drains that discharge out of the model area to the big horn river or to riparian areas and wetlands 3 2 irrigation the model was calibrated to within 1 5 m of measured water levels in most locations in the valley using only canal leakage and a small fraction 1 percent of the precipitation as recharge however some hydrographs such as that of well 236086 figs 1 and 3 showed distinctive sharp peaks superimposed upon the broad annual signal of canal leakage these peaks were interpreted to reflect recharge from flood irrigation applications because the twice monthly timing in 2014 matched the irrigation timing requirements of the sugar beet crop in place additionally the feeder ditch to this field is cement lined reducing the potential for leakage as a first step in estimating the amount of recharge from flood irrigation a 250 ha polygon centered on well 236086 was used to model additional recharge from flood irrigation the timing of the irrigation applications in the model were based upon observations of groundwater level rises the modeled amount of infiltration from applied irrigation water was determined through trial and error by matching the magnitude of the modeled water level change to the measured water level change to match the observed rises in water level 19 000 m3 0 76 cm over 250 ha of infiltrated water was added for each of 5 observed irrigation applications or 95 000 m3 y 1 3 8 cm y 1 over 250 ha to investigate how these findings scaled to the entire model area the irrigation recharge polygon was expanded to the entire model extent the timing of applications and infiltration amounts determined from the 236086 site 3 8 cm y 1 when applied over the entire model area resulted in an overabundance of water in the model including at the 236086 site fig 3 these results indicate the 250 ha polygon underestimated the area recharging this site a better fit to measured water levels at well 236086 and throughout the valley was found to be approximately 0 63 cm y 1 1 million m3y 1 applied to the entire model extent table 2 fig 3 the magnitude of the peaks are likely best fit by a value between these two values fig 3 however when considering the overall calibration of the model adding more than 0 63 cm y 1 resulted in water levels the target 1 5 m from measured levels in several locations the field used to estimate irrigation recharge rates monitored by well 236086 is flood irrigated and alternatively cultivated with small grains and sugar beets as in the majority of the valley the irrigation requirement for these crops is 43 56 cm y 1 17 22 inches per year personal communication evan vanorder august 19 2016 the model therefore predicts 1 percent 0 63 cm y 1 to less than 22 percent 3 8 cm y 1 of applied irrigation water recharges the aquifer reported flood irrigation efficiency the amount of applied water used by crops varies from 15 to 60 percent leaving 40 to 85 percent of the water available to infiltrate evaporate run off the surface or percolate through the soil in contrast sprinkler irrigation is 60 to 85 percent efficient grafton et al 2018 roberts 2012 the standard assumption is that the portion of the applied irrigation water not consumed through evapotranspiration is groundwater recharge however this water can also move through the soil package directly to drains a diffuse process that is difficult to measure the fraction of irrigation water that ultimately recharges the aquifer is site specific the low rate of infiltration in the bighorn river valley is likely caused by the clay layer overlying the gravel aquifer the modeled infiltration rate from flood applied irrigation at this site is half or less than the assumed rate less than 22 percent compared to approximately 50 percent the common practice of using the assumed rate of infiltration in flood irrigated fields arumi et al 2009 butler and abdo 2013 butler et al 2013 southerland et al 2014 waren et al 2016 may result in overestimating the relative importance of applied irrigation water as compared to canal leakage to groundwater recharge 3 3 canals and drains the model used starting values of measured flow as measured on september 18 2015 for 1 6 km reaches of the two canals a loss of 14 3 m3d 1 m 1 along the two leggins canal and a gain of 7 93 m3d 1 m 1 along the low line canal the model extrapolated the losses gains of these sites over the length of the canals with these values as starting points a parameter estimation pest package was used to determine the rate of loss and gain along the canals necessary to match the measured potentiometric surface and magnitude of water level changes in measured hydrographs the calibrated model shows that peak canal recharge discharge rates are the two leggins canal contributes 3 8 m3d 1 m 1 to the groundwater the low line canal removes 3 9 m3d 1 m 1 out of the modeled aquifer small drains all together carry an additional 1 8 m3d 1 m 1 out of the model these numbers are generally smaller than field measured values because they represent the average over the entire length of the canals both of which have losing and gaining reaches additionally it was not possible to verify from public right of ways any additional withdrawals from the canal for irrigation while flow measurements were being made over the calendar year 2015 the two leggins canal contributed 2 7 million m3 to the groundwater and the low line canal and smaller drains carried 7 2 million m3 out of the model to wetlands and or to the big horn river table 2 flow measurements confirm the role of the low line canal as a drain the computer model illustrates its importance the low line canal helps balance the combined contribution to the model area of leakage from the two leggins canal irrigation applications precipitation contributions from the river and groundwater moving in from the south the narrowing valley to the north provides less aquifer volume to accommodate groundwater and the low line canal and bighorn river provide conduits to continue moving the water to the north without the low line canal acting as a drain it is likely more land in the center of the valley would be waterlogged 3 4 river within measurement error the bighorn river did not gain or lose water between the measurement locations at the top and bottom of the study area absolute differences were 0 65 percent and 0 44 percent in july and september 2015 respectively the computer model predicts gaining and losing reaches in the bighorn river and an overall contribution to the groundwater of 3 06 million m3 in calendar year 2015 or 8380 m3d 1 table 2 the average bighorn river flow rate of 9 million m3d 1 usgs 2017 greatly exceeds the modeled gains and losses however the model results indicate the river plays and important role in the overall groundwater cycle in the valley additionally the model results indicate the previous understanding of the river being a gaining system along its length meredith et al 2009 a conclusion based on the potentiometric surface is too simplistic 4 conclusions the model predicts recharge from applied irrigation is approximately 1 3 the modeled contribution from leakage from the two leggins canal in this valley the two leggins canal is the primary source of irrigation related recharge to the groundwater this substantiates the findings of the previous investigation by meredith et al 2009 and is similar to the findings of arumi et al 2009 2013 for an irrigated valley in chile additionally the model results caution against simply using assumed recharge rates from applied irrigation based on percent efficiency of irrigation type when constructing groundwater models this work shows the possibility of overestimating recharge from irrigation if site specific conditions are not accounted for a more precise representation of the role of flood and pivot irrigation could be modeled by adding numerous small polygons with timings and rates tailored to fit the varied responses to irrigation seen throughout the valley without a denser network of monitoring wells quantification of recharge from applied irrigation includes significant error however this approximation allows us to compare the relative importance of applied irrigation versus canal leakage to groundwater recharge conservation efforts are not one size fits all in the bighorn valley irrigation water conservation efforts that also aim to maintain domestic groundwater supplies should focus on improving the efficiency of irrigation method rather than reducing leakage from the canals not only do the canals function to recharge the groundwater used for domestic purposes but they also serve an important function of draining excess water preventing waterlogging at the surface funding this work was supported by the montana department of natural resources and conservation

change cho et al 2009 turner et al 2015 differentiating precipitation from irrigation related recharge boonstra and bhutta 1996 purkey et al 2006 used inverse modeling to ascribe additional recharge from canals and retention ponds that were previously not included in the model inputs this inverse modeling tactic which added recharge at the canal until model results matched measured water levels was replicated in this project to quantify vertical infiltration from applied irrigation water in four irrigated montana valleys the montana bureau of mines and geology developed numerical groundwater models to illustrate and quantify the role of irrigation stillwater kuzara et al 2012 helena butler et al 2013 waren et al 2016 beaverhead butler and abdo 2013 and gallatin southerland et al 2014 all models used measured losses along canals as a starting point for recharge from canals most models butler and abdo 2013 butler et al 2013 southerland et al 2014 waren et al 2016 used initial estimated infiltration rates based upon crop use and irrigation method kuzara et al 2012 calculated infiltration rates in the stillwater valley based on chloride mass balance although the reported rates used different units and timeframes recharge from applied irrigation was 1 8 to 5 3 times greater than recharge from canal leakage except in the gallatin valley where it was 1 5 times less gallatin valley differed from the other modeled areas in that it has a high percentage of acres under pivot sprinkler irrigation and a high density of irrigation canals through the model calibration process initial irrigation infiltration rates were reduced in all models a groundwater model of the agricultural chilean peumo valley which has extensive canal construction also used irrigation method efficiency as an approximation for irrigation loss recharge arumi et al 2009 this model calculated the primary source of groundwater recharge was through canal seepage 52 percent with irrigation loss and precipitation making up the balance 22 and 26 percent respectively arumi et al 2009 previous work on the bighorn river valley found the majority of recharge was through canal leakage based on chloride and stable isotope analysis evidence that is supported by a steep potentiometric surface along the western irrigation canal showing groundwater flow away from the canal meredith et al 2009 however in contrast to the gallatin river valley and the peumo valley the bighorn river valley has few sprinkler irrigation systems and only two major irrigation canals the goals of this work are to evaluate the accuracy of assumed infiltration rates based on irrigation method and help direct conservation efforts through improved understanding of the relative importance of two irrigation related recharge pathways in alluvial groundwater availability canal leakage and infiltration from applied irrigation water 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site description the alluvial gravel aquifer of the bighorn river valley north of hardin montana fig 1 is approximately 4 6 m thick throughout the valley but locally thins to less than 1 5 m near the river gwic 2016 the gravel aquifer overlies the cretaceous formations from the bearpaw shale youngest to the niobrara shale oldest vuke et al 2000 thin sandstones of the cretaceous judith river formation underlie the aquifer in the middle of the study area however well records indicate it is not widely used as an aquifer gwic 2016 vuke et al 2000 a layer of clay and sandy clay ranging in thickness from more than 12 m near the western edge of the valley to absent along the river overlies the gravel aquifer these fine grained deposits are eroded in places by ephemeral drainages recorded water levels in some wells are above the top of the gravel aquifer indicating confined conditions in much of the aquifer the land use is agricultural cropland a typical crop rotation includes two years of small grains barley spring wheat or winter wheat and one year of sugar beets in any given year roughly one third of the acreage is cultivated with sugar beets and the remaining two thirds is in small grain secondary crops include corn and alfalfa personal communication even vanorder us natural resources conservation service nrcs august 2016 the two leggins and low line canals transport irrigation water diverted from the bighorn river along the western edge and center of the valley fig 2 the two leggins canal conveys approximately 730 000 m3d 1 and the low line canal generally less than 240 000 m3d 1 the two leggins canal hugs the western edge of the valley and crosses a mixture of bedrock clay deposits and ephemeral drainages most irrigators flood irrigate fields using gated pipe or siphons from small side canals feeder ditches this network of small feeder ditches both natural ephemeral drainages and constructed drains crisscross the valley often serving a dual purpose of providing irrigation water as well as draining excess water from the fields which prevents water logging the ground surface the alluvial groundwater moves generally from south to north and west to the east meredith et al 2009 aside from the small urban area of hardin approximately 250 ha the land use and hydrogeology south of the study area is similar to that in the study area the two leggins canal drives the west to east component of the groundwater flow the potentiometric surface meredith et al 2009 shows a steep groundwater gradient away from the two leggins canal and indicates the bighorn river gains along study area s reach within this report groundwater wells are referred to by their ground water information center identification number gwic 2016 2 2 water budget components and assumptions 2 2 1 groundwater inflow flow from the south average monthly water levels measured in well 279 512 fig 1 defined groundwater head at the southern model boundary canal leakage measured loss gain rates from 1 6 km reaches at two locations on each of the two leggins and low line canals were used as starting points in the calibration process precipitation five percent of average monthly precipitation rates western regional climate center 2016 average annual precipitation is 30 cm was added as recharge to the entire model area as a starting point for the calibration process irrigation infiltration vertical infiltration from irrigation was evident in some hydrographs but peaks associated with irrigation applications were small compared to the annual cycle associated with canal leakage e g wells 239730 236086 and 259285 on fig 1 recharge from irrigation infiltration was estimated through trial and error matching the model results to peaks in the hydrograph from flood irrigation application for one hydrograph well 236086 that rate was then applied to the entire model and revised during the calibration process groundwater modeling software does not simulate the hydrologic cycle rather only accounts for water that enters and leaves the groundwater volume therefore applied irrigation water that runs off the surface or through the soil to drains or is evapotransipired was not included in the model s calculations the difference between the volume of water applied to the surface through irrigation and the volume of water calculated to recharge the groundwater likely leaves the model area through these processes 2 2 2 groundwater outflow flow to the north well 156833 defines groundwater head at the northern border discharge to the river bighorn river flows were measured to define gain or loss across the study area however changes were below measurement threshold discharge to drains drains were mapped using google earth imagery and conductance values a model term to describe amount of water entering the drain chosen from the literature southerland et al 2014 drain elevations and lengths which control the amount of water they carry were estimated from aerial photographs discharge to wells there are approximately 116 domestic wells in the project area gwic 2016 the groundwater chemistry prevents its use for irrigation therefore the only well use is domestic the standard assumption is that a domestic well diverts 1 m3d 1 and consumes 10 percent water policy interim committee 2012 the consumption from domestic wells 11 6 m3d 1 or 4234 m3y 1 is less than 1 percent of the measured loss from the two leggins canal and was therefore not included in model calculations 2 2 3 change in storage the difference between inputs and outputs is the change in storage for the purposes of this model we focused on annual changes in storage water level fluctuations but excluded long term climate change 2 3 groundwater levels the potentiometric surface and annual water level fluctuations were the primary calibration targets ten unvented water level loggers and one barometer to correct for barometric effects measured water levels hourly from spring 2014 through fall 2016 water levels were verified approximately quarterly using a handheld electronic sounder the network of instrumented wells covered the east west and north south extents of the study area fig 1 all water level data are available on the ground water information center database gwic 2016 2 4 canal and river flow measurements canal and river flow rates were measured at bridges using a teledyne river surveyor acoustic doppler current profiler acdp flow rates were measured at each location at least 10 times and until replications were within 5 percent error as much as possible canal measurements were at times of minimal diversions to fields however we could not always visually verify diversions from public right of ways flow rates were measured in july and september of 2015 2 5 groundwater model construction and calibration a numeric computer model representing approximately 24 km by 6 km of the alluvial valley was constructed in groundwater modeling system gms 10 1 aquaveo that uses modflow 2005 as a platform modflow is a finite difference three dimensional grid flow model created by the united states geological survey harbaugh 2005 mcdonald and harbaugh 1988 the two leggins canal bounding the model on the west and the north and south model boundaries were defined as general head boundaries to model flux across the boundary proportional to the difference in head the bighorn river bounding the model on the east is defined as a river to simulate head dependent flux that follows river stage blais 2017 published well information including groundwater elevations total depths and lithology from 48 water wells in the model area defined the model stratigraphy gwic 2016 irrigation canals in this area carry water from april through september outside of this timeframe canal conductance was set to zero to indicate no potential for recharge however the canals were allowed to act as drains year round so groundwater could leave the aquifer through these conduits small drains both natural ephemeral drainages and constructed drains were added to the model where they could be visually identified in aerial photographs drain lengths vary from 1200 to 6000 m the model s initial conditions were the potentiometric heads measured in april 2014 just before the irrigation season began a two layer three dimensional grid represented the alluvial upper layer and a shale bottom layer the rectangular grid frame was 61 m by 244 m cells 115 cells in the x direction 97 cells in the y direction the thickness z direction of the upper layer was defined by the well head elevation and alluvial thickness from drilling information from 48 wells in the study area gwic 2016 the thickness of the shale bottom layer was a constant 122 m superimposed upon the upper alluvial layer were two polygons one covering the majority of the valley the alluvium polygon and a narrow polygon equivalent to the current floodplain the river gravel polygon the polygons were used to assign different aquifer parameters to the cells within the model the model accounts for the role of the overlying clay layer by using aquifer parameters consistent with confined conditions if warranted water levels in the 10 monitored wells became calibration targets the average groundwater levels in april 2014 were the calibration targets for the steady state model modelers used parameter estimation pest 13 0 developed by watermark numerical computing software and manually adjusted hydraulic parameters within published values until modeled water levels matched measured values table 1 within 1 5 m in most locations pest software begins with an initial set of hydrogeologic parameters defined by the modeler from field measurements or published values and iterates combinations of these values within ranges established by the modeler the iteration process is considered complete when the error between modeled and measured water levels has been minimized anderson et al 2015 welter et al 2015 starting hydraulic conductivity values were taken from the results of two published aquifer pumping tests performed in 2007 meredith et al 2009 the measured hydraulic conductivity near the river well 239729 63 m d 1 was applied to the river gravel polygon measured hydraulic conductivity by the canal well 239730 19 m d 1 was applied to the alluvium polygon through the calibration process the hydraulic conductivity of the alluvium polygon was lowered to 15 m d 1 but the river gravel polygon was held at 63 m d 1 the final modeled hydraulic conductivities and specific storage for the alluvium polygon are near the low end of the published values table 1 the specific yield and porosity for the alluvium and river gravel polygons are within published ranges through pest calibration the percent precipitation that was included as recharge was lowered from five to one percent of the average monthly precipitation after calibration the model was validated by running a transient time series model and verifying the magnitude and timing of modeled water level changes matched the 32 months of recorded water levels from monitored wells within a 1 5 m tolerance sensitivity analysis showed that specific storage played a key role in matching modeled water levels to groundwater response to the activation in the spring and shut down in the fall of the two leggins canal calibration targets are evaluated quantitatively and qualitatively but there are no industry guidelines for acceptable magnitude of error anderson et al 2015 the model was considered well calibrated when 1 the modeled potentiometric surface matched a hand drawn surface based on 82 measured water levels to within 1 5 m figs 1 and 2 modeled hydrographs amplitude and timing matched measured groundwater behavior the calibration target of 1 5 m was chosen because it represents less than 5 percent of the approximately 40 m of head change from the south model boundary to the north model boundary nine out of ten calibration targets fell within 1 5 m of the observed water levels and charting observed versus modeled results has a slope 1 0156 excluding well 156833 indicating the model provides a good fit to measured water levels fig 2 modeled water levels at the calibration target at the northern end of the model well 156833 did not match observed values the exact cause is unknown but likely relates to a narrowing valley and a corresponding reduction of aquifer volume 3 results and discussion 3 1 model water budget canals supply recharge water during the months they are active usually april through september or early october irrigation water is applied periodically to fields through this same timeframe the rate of canal loss is dependent upon the difference in head between the canal and the groundwater so as the difference becomes less the leakage rate reduces the total input and output of each budget component was summed over the 2015 calendar year to compare all the inputs and outputs values are presented on table 2 as a yearly total the south to north component of the groundwater flow is much smaller than west to east as shown by the small volume of water crossing the southern and northern boundaries as compared to water leaving and entering along the west two leggins canal and east big horn river boundaries and through canals and drains table 2 most of the water moving through the aquifer originates from the application of irrigation water and leakage from the two leggins canal the big horn river also contributes water to the highly conductive river gravel polygon water moves out of the aquifer through the low line canal and to smaller drains that discharge out of the model area to the big horn river or to riparian areas and wetlands 3 2 irrigation the model was calibrated to within 1 5 m of measured water levels in most locations in the valley using only canal leakage and a small fraction 1 percent of the precipitation as recharge however some hydrographs such as that of well 236086 figs 1 and 3 showed distinctive sharp peaks superimposed upon the broad annual signal of canal leakage these peaks were interpreted to reflect recharge from flood irrigation applications because the twice monthly timing in 2014 matched the irrigation timing requirements of the sugar beet crop in place additionally the feeder ditch to this field is cement lined reducing the potential for leakage as a first step in estimating the amount of recharge from flood irrigation a 250 ha polygon centered on well 236086 was used to model additional recharge from flood irrigation the timing of the irrigation applications in the model were based upon observations of groundwater level rises the modeled amount of infiltration from applied irrigation water was determined through trial and error by matching the magnitude of the modeled water level change to the measured water level change to match the observed rises in water level 19 000 m3 0 76 cm over 250 ha of infiltrated water was added for each of 5 observed irrigation applications or 95 000 m3 y 1 3 8 cm y 1 over 250 ha to investigate how these findings scaled to the entire model area the irrigation recharge polygon was expanded to the entire model extent the timing of applications and infiltration amounts determined from the 236086 site 3 8 cm y 1 when applied over the entire model area resulted in an overabundance of water in the model including at the 236086 site fig 3 these results indicate the 250 ha polygon underestimated the area recharging this site a better fit to measured water levels at well 236086 and throughout the valley was found to be approximately 0 63 cm y 1 1 million m3y 1 applied to the entire model extent table 2 fig 3 the magnitude of the peaks are likely best fit by a value between these two values fig 3 however when considering the overall calibration of the model adding more than 0 63 cm y 1 resulted in water levels the target 1 5 m from measured levels in several locations the field used to estimate irrigation recharge rates monitored by well 236086 is flood irrigated and alternatively cultivated with small grains and sugar beets as in the majority of the valley the irrigation requirement for these crops is 43 56 cm y 1 17 22 inches per year personal communication evan vanorder august 19 2016 the model therefore predicts 1 percent 0 63 cm y 1 to less than 22 percent 3 8 cm y 1 of applied irrigation water recharges the aquifer reported flood irrigation efficiency the amount of applied water used by crops varies from 15 to 60 percent leaving 40 to 85 percent of the water available to infiltrate evaporate run off the surface or percolate through the soil in contrast sprinkler irrigation is 60 to 85 percent efficient grafton et al 2018 roberts 2012 the standard assumption is that the portion of the applied irrigation water not consumed through evapotranspiration is groundwater recharge however this water can also move through the soil package directly to drains a diffuse process that is difficult to measure the fraction of irrigation water that ultimately recharges the aquifer is site specific the low rate of infiltration in the bighorn river valley is likely caused by the clay layer overlying the gravel aquifer the modeled infiltration rate from flood applied irrigation at this site is half or less than the assumed rate less than 22 percent compared to approximately 50 percent the common practice of using the assumed rate of infiltration in flood irrigated fields arumi et al 2009 butler and abdo 2013 butler et al 2013 southerland et al 2014 waren et al 2016 may result in overestimating the relative importance of applied irrigation water as compared to canal leakage to groundwater recharge 3 3 canals and drains the model used starting values of measured flow as measured on september 18 2015 for 1 6 km reaches of the two canals a loss of 14 3 m3d 1 m 1 along the two leggins canal and a gain of 7 93 m3d 1 m 1 along the low line canal the model extrapolated the losses gains of these sites over the length of the canals with these values as starting points a parameter estimation pest package was used to determine the rate of loss and gain along the canals necessary to match the measured potentiometric surface and magnitude of water level changes in measured hydrographs the calibrated model shows that peak canal recharge discharge rates are the two leggins canal contributes 3 8 m3d 1 m 1 to the groundwater the low line canal removes 3 9 m3d 1 m 1 out of the modeled aquifer small drains all together carry an additional 1 8 m3d 1 m 1 out of the model these numbers are generally smaller than field measured values because they represent the average over the entire length of the canals both of which have losing and gaining reaches additionally it was not possible to verify from public right of ways any additional withdrawals from the canal for irrigation while flow measurements were being made over the calendar year 2015 the two leggins canal contributed 2 7 million m3 to the groundwater and the low line canal and smaller drains carried 7 2 million m3 out of the model to wetlands and or to the big horn river table 2 flow measurements confirm the role of the low line canal as a drain the computer model illustrates its importance the low line canal helps balance the combined contribution to the model area of leakage from the two leggins canal irrigation applications precipitation contributions from the river and groundwater moving in from the south the narrowing valley to the north provides less aquifer volume to accommodate groundwater and the low line canal and bighorn river provide conduits to continue moving the water to the north without the low line canal acting as a drain it is likely more land in the center of the valley would be waterlogged 3 4 river within measurement error the bighorn river did not gain or lose water between the measurement locations at the top and bottom of the study area absolute differences were 0 65 percent and 0 44 percent in july and september 2015 respectively the computer model predicts gaining and losing reaches in the bighorn river and an overall contribution to the groundwater of 3 06 million m3 in calendar year 2015 or 8380 m3d 1 table 2 the average bighorn river flow rate of 9 million m3d 1 usgs 2017 greatly exceeds the modeled gains and losses however the model results indicate the river plays and important role in the overall groundwater cycle in the valley additionally the model results indicate the previous understanding of the river being a gaining system along its length meredith et al 2009 a conclusion based on the potentiometric surface is too simplistic 4 conclusions the model predicts recharge from applied irrigation is approximately 1 3 the modeled contribution from leakage from the two leggins canal in this valley the two leggins canal is the primary source of irrigation related recharge to the groundwater this substantiates the findings of the previous investigation by meredith et al 2009 and is similar to the findings of arumi et al 2009 2013 for an irrigated valley in chile additionally the model results caution against simply using assumed recharge rates from applied irrigation based on percent efficiency of irrigation type when constructing groundwater models this work shows the possibility of overestimating recharge from irrigation if site specific conditions are not accounted for a more precise representation of the role of flood and pivot irrigation could be modeled by adding numerous small polygons with timings and rates tailored to fit the varied responses to irrigation seen throughout the valley without a denser network of monitoring wells quantification of recharge from applied irrigation includes significant error however this approximation allows us to compare the relative importance of applied irrigation versus canal leakage to groundwater recharge conservation efforts are not one size fits all in the bighorn valley irrigation water conservation efforts that also aim to maintain domestic groundwater supplies should focus on improving the efficiency of irrigation method rather than reducing leakage from the canals not only do the canals function to recharge the groundwater used for domestic purposes but they also serve an important function of draining excess water preventing waterlogging at the surface funding this work was supported by the montana department of natural resources and conservation

access to their domestic wells and the us geological survey and montana department of agriculture who allowed access to their monitoring wells 
11148,enhancing water use efficiency wue while maintaining productivity represents a challenge particularly in arid and semi arid environments the use antitranspirants ats is an effective approach to mitigate water deficit and drought induced yield losses via reducing transpiration this study aimed to determine the effects of ats compounds on wue and root and shoot physiological responses of two snap bean genotypes with different ozone sensitivity tolerant r123 and sensitive s156 under glasshouse conditions plants were sprayed 25 days after planting with 4 w v kaolin kpf 0 0015 w v fulvic

potential ψw total dry matter tdm dry matter accumulation rate dmar leaf temperature plant survival and root development were determined there was a minimal genotype effect on all parameters except tdm dmar and fine root diameter and length kpf treatment was cooler than the control 3 83 c consequently had higher ψw and lower wc without affecting tdm and dmar therefore biomass wue total dry matter transpired water of kpf treatment increased 29 4 and 13 3 for r123 and s156 respectively pinolene and fa treatments exerted no effects on those parameters kpf treatment alleviated most of the physiological effects of water deficit hence plants survived longer kpf and fa treatments had thicker very fine 0 0726 to 0 29 mm and fine 0 308 to 0 562 mm roots than the control with kpf having the strongest effect on roots development pinolene treatment showed no effect on the roots of r123 but conditioned significant thickening of s156 roots a notable reversal of the observed effect of kpf and fa in conclusion conserved water by kpf could reduce irrigation frequency and later play as a crucial water resource for plant survival moreover future research with ats must take root responses into account keywords transpiration kaolin pinolene water use efficiency fine roots very fine roots 1 introduction in the future crop production will be more difficult under climate change due to global warming more frequent droughts and heat waves medrano et al 2015b vicente serrano et al 2014 world water assessment programme 2012 furthermore water scarcity is exacerbated by the expected increase in the world population wallace 2000 which leads to a decline in the available water capita as well as water available for agriculture consequently irrigated agriculture will take place under water deficit fao 2016 sposito 2013 and plants might be subjected to short or long drought periods geerts and raes 2009 leading to yield losses due to these major changes climate change and increased water scarcity irrigation water management will alter towards maximizing crop production per water unit increasing water use efficiency wue rather than optimizing crop production per land unit fereres and soriano 2007 pascale et al 2011 for the aforementioned reasons optimizing wue is a crucial goal to ensure food security particularly in arid and semi arid regions where water resources are limited boari et al 2015 bodner et al 2015 medrano et al 2015b however saving water for the purpose of wue optimization cannot be made at the expense of yield and or fruit quality in order to secure economical sustainability for producers brillante et al 2016 several materials known as antitranspirants ats are able to mitigate water deficit drought stress or salinity stress via reducing leaf water losses reducing transpiration consequently soil moisture could be preserved for longer periods thus postponing the onset of drought abdullah et al 2015 boari et al 2016 2015 goreta et al 2007 three types of ats are currently available anderson and kreith 1978 the first class is bio chemical active compounds metabolic inhibitors such as abscisic acid aba and fulvic acid fa their application reduces transpiration by preventing the stomata from fully opening anjum et al 2011 wang et al 2003 zhang et al 2016 for example exogenous application of aba was found to reduce transpiration and enhance drought tolerance in several plant species al absi 2009 du et al 2013 kondo et al 2012 waterland et al 2010 the second ats class includes film forming materials which mechanically limits plant transpiration by hindering water vapor escape from the leaves to the atmosphere gu et al 1998 for instance di 1 p menthene c20h34 a terpenic polymer commonly named pinolene pin derived from pine resin is used as a film forming antitranspirant del amor et al 2010 indicated that pin application at 2 5 v v improved drought tolerance in sweet pepper plants the third class is the reflective materials known as particle film technology glenn and puterka 2005 this approach involves spraying lime calcium sulphate or engineered processed clays such as kaolin aluminum phyllosilicate al2si2o5 oh 4 to cover plant leaves with thin films of nanoparticles boari et al 2016 2015 2014 glenn et al 2003 2001 glenn and puterka 2005 kaolin is a wettable hydrophobic non abrasive and non toxic clay mineral with a particle diameter of 2 μm glenn and puterka 2005 cantore et al 2009 heating kaolin converts the silicate to white which greatly increases its light reflectance properties brillante et al 2016 glenn et al 2001 therefore kaolin on plant leaves creates a film of white nanoparticles that partially reflects ultraviolet ut and infrared ir radiation lowering canopy temperature and reducing transpiration glenn and puterka 2005 this property has been effectively used in horticulture to prevent fruits sunburn cantore et al 2009 recently kpf has been proposed as a supplemental tool to save water and to protect plants against drought stress on several species e g clementine oranges and tomatoes abdallah et al 2018 boari et al 2015 cantore et al 2009 fruit trees coniberti et al 2013 dinis et al 2016 glenn 2012 shellie et al 2013 numerous studies showed an increase in yield and fruit quality of different crops treated with kpf boari et al 2014 coniberti et al 2013 dinis et al 2016 ergun 2012 glenn 2012 glenn et al 2003 2001 glenn and puterka 2007 khaleghi et al 2015 shellie et al 2013 shellie and king 2013 however there are studies showed no effects of kpf on fruit yield and quality kahn and damicone 2008 schupp et al 2002 a controversy over kpf effects on leaf gas exchange and carbon c assimilation rate has been reported some authors reported no negative effect or even found an increase in c assimilation and stomatal conductance boari et al 2014 coniberti et al 2013 dinis et al 2016 ergun 2012 glenn 2012 shellie et al 2013 shellie and king 2013 steiman et al 2007 while others observed a reduction cantore et al 2009 the ats differ in their longevity duration of effectiveness which determines its spraying frequency davenport et al 1969 the effect of metabolic ats are usually short lived compared to other ats types al absi and archbold 2016 anderson and kreith 1978 kreith et al 1975 the durability of film forming ats is dependent on plant species film type concentration and environmental conditions anderson and kreith 1978 davies and k t 1974 kreith et al 1975 mohawesh et al 2010 on the other hand the reflective ats could be long lasting unless they are washed out by rain water cantore et al 2009 davenport et al 1969 reported that the duration of ats effectiveness is a function of durability of the material spraying operation environmental conditions i e precipitation temperature and humidity and the amount of newly emerged leaves after last ats foliar application it is well established that plants under environmental changes can modify the development of fine fr 0 308 to 0 562 mm and very fine vfr 0 0726 to 0 29 mm roots zobel 2003 2016 2013 zobel et al 2007 2006 however no literature has investigated yet the root responses to treating plant leaves with ats if ats treatment modifies transpiration over time it is expected that the plant may modify its root system accordingly a suitable hypothesis would be in the presence of an effective antitranspirant the demand for water from the roots would reduce resulting in developing roots that are less efficient in water uptake i e thicker and or shorter roots while utilizing less carbohydrates for construction and maintenance the two snap bean phaseolus vulgaris l lines s156 and r123 are ozone sensitive tolerant genotypes respectively commonly used as an ozone bio indicator system burkey et al 2005 while differing in ozone response s156 and r123 have similar rates of stomatal conductance flowers et al 2007 and transpiration fiscus et al 2012 given that these snap bean genotypes are well characterized in terms of leaf physiology this system provides a good set of plant material to determine the influence of different ats on whole plant water consumption most ats studies were conducted under drought stress or water deficit few studies looked at how water consumption changes along the irrigation drying cycle of the ats treated plants in addition fewer studied examined the survival of the ats treated plants under extreme drought to our knowledge no study has yet investigated the effects of ats on water consumption wue physiological performance and root development of snap beans under well irrigated conditions therefore the main objectives of this work were to 1 assess changes in daily water consumption prior the application of three ats that differ in their mode of actions by two snap beans genotypes that differ in their response to ozone 2 characterize how ats compounds function under sufficient water supply and under severe water deficit 3 assess the long survival of ats treated plants relative to the control plants and 4 assess the modification development of fr and vfr after ats application 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental

meanwhile control plants were sprayed with water after ats application pots were arranged in a completely randomized block design with three replicates then plants were subjected to three irrigation drying cycles with a drying interval of 5 days imposed the pots were rotated within the glasshouse at each irrigation event to ensure that plants have similar micro climatic uniform distribution of light and air at each irrigation event plants were irrigated until soil reached field capacity this was done by placing each pot perforated from the bottom in a saucer of water to allow soil saturation from the bottom via capillary rise when the soils were saturated the saucers were removed and excess water drained gravimetrically overnight until pots showed negligible drainage agaba et al 2010 chen et al 2003 to prevent evaporation from soil surface each pot was carefully placed in a white plastic bag gently tied around the stem base shi et al 2010 therefore in the current study water loss was mainly via plant transpiration to estimate the daily water consumption mm d 1 the daily weight loss from pots together with the plant was gravimetrically determined every morning 9 00 abdullah et al 2015 chen et al 2003 plants received the second irrigation when the control plants depleted 50 of available water capacity additionally plant water consumption for each irrigation drying cycle and over the three irrigation drying cycles was calculated following the initiation of the third irrigation event plants were allowed to consume the available water and then harvested following plant death and the survival time days was determined plant survival was monitored daily by observing the color change of leaves and stems plants were declared dead when the leaves and stems turned from green to brown leaves began to abscise and branches became brittle yang et al 2014 the total time to reach death was considered as the survival time hüttermann et al 1999 the harvested plants were divided into shoots and roots and have been dried separately in the oven for two days at 70 c until a constant weight was recorded then total dry matter tdm was determined and dry matter accumulation rate dmar was calculated 2 3 root harvest roots were harvested by carefully removing potting soil followed by an initial wash in tap water and a final rinse in clean tap water to remove a majority of debris from fine roots paper towels were used to remove excess water from processed root systems the entire root system was cut into small segments a few cm in length and a random one g sample stored in a tube with faa fixative 50 ethanol 5 acetic acid and 3 8 formaldehyde in distilled de ionized water for measurements of root diameter the remaining root material was dried at 70 c 2 4 measurements 2 4 1 leaf water potential ψw leaf water potential was measured on the last day of the first irrigation drying cycle after 5 days of ats application two recent fully expanded mature leaves on each replicate were measured using a pressure bomb model 610 pms instruments corvallis or usa as described by turner 1988 measurements were taken between 10 a m and 12 p m each leaf was cut at the petiole base and immediately placed in the pressure chamber with about 5 mm of the cut end of the petiole protruding through the compressible rubber gland used to seal the chamber compressed breathing air was released into the chamber until the sap returned to the cut end of the xylem and the pressure required mpa was recorded 2 4 2 leaf temperature leaf temperature lt 0 5 c at 25 c was measured using infrared thermometer omegaette os542 infrared thermometer omega engineering inc norwalk ct 06854 on the last day fifth day of the first irrigation drying cycle measurements were

resulting images were edited using photoshop to remove the large amounts of detritus materials remaining from potting soil used for this experiment most root samples were cleaned up well but the roots of the control and pin treated r123 plants were especially difficult after imaging the images were analyzed with winrhizo software arabidopsis version the very fine roots vfr occupy meso diameter

plants with the ats five uniform plants of each cultivar were harvested and dried then the initial total dry weight tdw g was recorded similarly final tdw was measured after harvesting the treatments in the current study wuebiomass g mm 1 was calculated as the ratio between accumulated total dry matter g and the total wc mm over the three irrigation drying cycles w u e b i o m a s s f i n a l t d

to tukey s test statistical tests for the root analyses were carried out using the ammi analysis zobel et al 1988 in the r statistical package http r project org to give a high resolution interaction analysis 3 results 3 1 leaf temperature overall lt increased from morning 9 00 10 00 towards the solar zenith 13 00 14 00 and declined in the afternoon 17 00 18 00 analyzing the data for the two genotypes the two way model anova revealed no significant differences in lt neither in the morning nor the afternoon data not shown among genotypes p 0 2658 and 0 4351 respectively or ats p 0 2704 and 0 1601 respectively however significant p 0 05 differences in lt were observed among treatments only at mid day as lt of r123 genotype was significantly p 0 0073 higher than s156 genotype nevertheless when mid day lt data were pooled by the ats fig 1 a significant differences p 0001 were observed pinolene application significantly increased lt by 1 87 and 5 16 c as compared to the control and the kpf respectively but there was no significant difference between pin and fa treated leaves on the other hand kpf treated plants were significantly cooler 3 83 c than the control the results of lt in the morning mid day and afternoon were analyzed separately a significant ats by genotype interaction p 0 0126 was observed only at mid day fig 2 the presence of kpf significantly reduced lt for both genotypes as compared to the control pin and fa kpf treated plants were cooler than the control plants by 4 56 c and 3 10 c for the r123 and s156 genotypes respectively no significant differences were recorded among the pin fa and the control in case of r123 this contrasted with s156 where pin application increased lt compared to the control while no differences were observed between pin and fa 3 2 leaf water potential ψw the effect of the genotype on ψw was minimal and there were no significant differences p 0 2032 between the two tested genotypes data not shown moreover the interaction between the genotype and ats was also not significant p 0 9286 when data pooled by ats kpf and fa treatments significantly increased ψw with respect to the control fig 1b no significant difference was observed between pin treatment and the control kpf treated plants had significantly p 0 05 higher ψw values than pin fa and control 3 3 chlorophyll content total dry matter and dry matter accumulation

showed significant p 0001 in both cases genotype differences with r123 being a larger plant 46 59 g for r123 and 30 81 g for s156 that accumulated dry matter at a higher rate than s156 2 39 g d 1 for r123 and 1 59 g d 1 for s156 there were no significant ats effects summing the data by ats or ats by genotype interactions fig 3 3 4 plant water consumption wc generally total wc over the three irrigation drying cycles was significantly affected by the selected ats a significant p 0 0001 reduction in wc was observed for the kpf treated plants when data were pooled over the ats while pin and fa treatments were not different from the control fig 4 total wc reduced by 10 73 3 4 and 2 55 for kpf pin and fa respectively relative to control plants the genotype had no significant effect p 0 9466 on wc data not shown for example when summing over ats treatments wc during the first irrigation drying cycle was almost identical for the two genotypes 12 34 and 12 24 mm d 1 for the r123 and s156 genotypes respectively in the first irrigation drying cycle when data were pooled by ats treatment kpf significantly p 0 0001 reduced wc by 2 1 mm d 1 15 6 relative to the control plants in which the relative wc was 84 4 minor insignificant reductions were also recorded for both pin and fa fig 5 no genotype by ats interaction was observed data not shown similar trends were observed in the second irrigation draying cycle whereas the relative water consumption was significantly p 0 0001 lower by 16 for the kpf treated plants during the third irrigation drying cycle the relative wc was not significantly affected by the ats as plants were subjected to a survivability test allowing them to consume all water available in the root zone fig 5 regarding the pattern of the daily wc curves fig 6 results of both genotypes showed that wc of kpf treated plants was consistently lower early in the irrigation drying cycles than control pin and fa treated plants the opposite was observed on the final day of each irrigation drying cycle in which wc was higher in the kpf treated plants indicating that water conserved earlier in the cycle was now available while plants subjected to other treatments were under water stress water conservation under the kpf treatment allowed plant survival for 6 days during the third irrigation drying cycle while plants subjected to other treatment survived only 5 days fig 6 3 5 biomass water use efficiency wuebiomass the results showed wuebiomass to be affected by its two components accumulated dry matter and consumed water biomass wue of r123 genotype was significantly p 0 0001 higher than wuebiomass of the s156 genotype 0 203 g mm 1 for r123 and 0 135 g mm 1 for s156 no significant p 0 2625 genotype by ats interaction was observed when data were pooled by ats fig 4 kpf treated plants found to be significantly p 0 0464 higher than the control and other ats treatments 3 6 root diameter class and diameter class length effects a histogram of the length of root diameter classes fig 7 shows that both treatment and genotype s s156 and r r123 lines produce different histogram patterns the very fine roots vfr occupy meso diameter class mdc 1 between 0 0726 and 0 29 mm diameter and the fine roots fr occupy a meso diameter class mdc 2 between 0 308 and 0 562 mm diameter fig 7 shows that the s156 cultivar roots control cs kpf treated s156 kpf s and fulvic acid s156 fa s have peak diameter class lengths dcls that are longer higher peak and diameter classes dcs thinner smaller dcs than the treated r123 plants kpf treated r123 kpf r and fulvic acid treated r123 fa r the histogram and a nonlinear curve fitting using a gaussian model table 1 also suggests that the kpf pin and fa treatments stimulated a slight thickening 12 for kpf s 15 for pin s and 10 for fa s of the vfr roots of the s156 plants reflected in the shift in root diameter at maximum peak height mdc 1 in table 1 although the pattern for the control r123 cr and pin treated r123 pin r is difficult to analyze visually because of the effects of increased detritus in the washed root images of the r123 plants pin unexpectedly showed longer vfr with no effect on their diameter results of the second root meso diameter class mdc 2 showed that control plants of r123 had longer mdc 2 roots than s156 fig 7 for the two genotypes fa and kpf had no significant effect on mdc 2 roots on the other hand pin showed genotype specific effects on mdc 2 where the application of pin to bean plant leaves resulted in shorter mdc 2 roots of the r123 plants and longer mdc 2 roots of the s156 plants the ammi interaction analysis determined that two singular values two interaction axes ia table 2 were significant the biplot of these two axes fig 8 demonstrates that both kpf and fa treatments condition larger diameter roots compared to the control with kpf having the stronger effect ia 1 21 of the interaction variance fig 8 the first axis also demonstrates that pin has no effect on fine and v fine root diameter with the r123 line but has a strong root thickening effect on the s156 line the second axis 17 of the interaction variation demonstrates a clear separation of r123 and s156 and is best explained as the effect of the detritus which was prevalent in pin r c r and fa r with little or no detritus and therefore little or no impact on c s fa s and kpf s the remainder of the interaction variation was identified as noise 4 discussion in the current study we investigated the effect of different ats on the physiological performance pattern of water consumption wuebiomass and root development of two snap beans lines for three irrigation drying cycles a novelty of this work is the study of root response by two snap beans lines differing in their ozone sensitivity to foliar application of three ats with different mode of actions the effect of the investigated ats was clearly observed through lt measurements particularly at mid day the superiority of kpf over the pin and fa in reducing lt might be attributed to the white kpf ability to reflect the ut and ir glenn and puterka 2005 meanwhile the significant lt increase of pin treated plants at mid day could be due to the reduction of evaporative cooling because of the transpiration reduction faralli et al 2016 the significant reduction in canopy and or leaf temperature due to kpf application was previously observed abdallah 2017 boari et al 2015 bodner et al 2015 glenn 2010 jifon and syvertsen 2003 medrano et al 2015b shellie and king 2013 for example glenn 2016 indicated that canopy temperature was significantly lower for kpf treatment 24 c compared to the control 26 c the lt increase of pin treated leaves support the results of brillante et al 2016 in which they reported that pin treatment had significantly warmer leaves 1 19 c and 1 43 c higher than control and kpf respectively in the morning and late afternoon when irradiance levels were lower all plants almost had the same lt indicating that kpf treatment was most effective when energy input light intensity was greatest at mid day our results were supported with those of abdallah et al 2018 glenn 2010 glenn et al 2001 in which they indicated that the temperature difference between kpf treated and non treated plants increases towards the solar zenith 13 00 15 00 and decreasing in the morning and in the afternoon however brillante et al 2016 and cantore et al 2009 found an increase of 1 5 c in grapevines and 1 c in tomato sprayed with kpf only when photosynthetic photon flux density ppfd is low indicating that the kpf effect is light intensity dependent it could be concluded that as kpf acts on lt by light reflection its effect could be reduced or even negligible when the ppfd is low in less irradiant times or environments in less irradiant times or environments kpf could reduce gas exchange by limiting transpiration possibly due to stomatal blockage therefore it causes a contemporary increase in heating plant leaves brillante et al 2016 however when ppfd is high the highly reflective properties of kpf result in a leaf and canopy temperature less than the untreated plants therefore kpf would reduce ct and thus transpiration rate more than photosynthesis in plants grown only at high solar radiation levels the reflective nature of kpf which may have reduced the absorption of radiant energy particularly at mid day not only reduced the lt but also regulated transpiration resulting in significant improvements in plant water relations of kpf treated plants the positive effect of kpf treated plants in ψw was also reported in several studies shellie and glenn 2008 glenn et al 2010 boari et al 2014 2015 brillante et al 2016 indicating that kpf could be a promising tool for regulating transpiration to maintain a favorable plant water status contrary goreta et al 2007 found that kpf did not inﬂuence plant water relations in addition shellie 2015 indicated that vine water status differed by irrigation amount and among years but was not significantly influenced by kpf treatment the absence of the significant effect of pin treatment on ψw is in agreement with brillante et al 2016 in which pin application did not significantly enhance plant water relations of grapevines the inconsistency among studies regarding the effect of ats on plant water relations could be explained by utilizing different plant species environment and to the severity of heat and water stresses the reduction in wc of kpf treated plants relative to the control might be due to the reduction in transpiration as evaporation was minimized through covering the pots with white plastic bags the significant wc reduction of kpf treated plants might be attributed to the reduction in lt consequently potential transpiration boari et al 2015 bodner et al 2015 glenn 2010 jifon and syvertsen 2003 medrano et al 2015b additionally the pattern of daily wc of kpf treated plants was less early in the three irrigation drying cycles than control and other ats treatments however on the last day of each irrigation drying cycle an opposite trend was observed where wc of kpf treatment was higher indicating that water conserved earlier in each cycle irrigation drying cycle was later available while plants subjected to other treatments were water stressed at the end of each irrigation drying cycle therefore the water conservation under the kpf treatment allowed plant survival for 6 days during the third irrigation drying cycle while plants subjected to other treatment survived only 5 days fig 6 the wc reduction of kpf treated plants observed herein is in agreement with the results reported for well watered bean crop boari et al 2015 as well as for other species including vine brillante et al 2016 tomato cantore et al 2009 where the evapotranspiration was reduced by 20 and strawberry santos et al 2012 in which plant water requirements were reduced by 30 during plant establishment kpf results disagreed with those of al absi and archbold 2016 who indicated that the use of kpf did not alleviate water deficit stress in apple seedlings the absence of pin effect on reducing wc might be due to a limited duration of the films davies and k t 1974 mohawesh et al 2010 this lack of significance pin effect was also supported by brillante et al 2016 in which they found that pin application did not significantly reduce the plant wc in vines in contrast faralli et al 2016 reported that the application of pin may be a useful crop management tool to avoid severe drought induced yield losses in oilseed rape moreover the lack of fa effect observed in the current study was in contrast to anjum et al 2011 who showed that fa application 1 5 mg l 1 on maize significantly improved crop performance under both drought and well watered conditions generally the use of ats could reduce wc but the effectiveness appears to be dependent upon the crop species of interest and the severity of heat and water stresses it is well established that reductions in photosynthesis lead to declines in shoot biomass supporting the use of tdm to approximate carbon c assimilation medrano et al 2015a consequently the non significant effect of ats on tdm observed in this study suggest that the tested ats had no effect on c assimilation the non significant effect of pin on c assimilation is in agreement with the findings of faralli et al 2016 in which they reported that c assimilation rate was sustained after the application of two film forming ats poly 1 p menthene and di 1 p menthene opposite results were reported by others papers brillante et al 2016 del amor et al 2010 palliotti et al 2010 where the use of pin caused a decline in c assimilation our results regarding fa were similar to those obtained by anjum et al 2011 in which they demonstrated that c assimilation was sustained under fa application regarding the impact of kpf on plant photosynthesis some authors reported that kpf reduced heat stress without negatively affecting c assimilation abdallah et al 2018 boari et al 2015 brillante et al 2016 moreover glenn et al 2001 and shellie and glenn 2008 reported an increase in gas exchange in apple and wine grape respectively and reported microscope photography showing open stomata in kpf sprayed leaves at the leaf level kpf treatment could reduce the net photosynthesis by the partial light reflection wünsche et al 2004 however the light reflection into the interior of the canopy could enhance diffusion of par together with the reduction in canopy temperature consequently increasing the whole canopy photosynthesis glenn 2010 2009 glenn et al 2003 others researchers found reductions in stomatal conductance indicating that kpf treatment reduced the light available to the leaf by increasing light reflection wünsche et al 2004 pace et al 2007 cantore et al 2009 shellie 2015 resulting in a reduction c assimilation under optimum irrigation but improved c assimilation under deficit irrigation cantore et al 2009 the inconsistency of kpf effects among different studies could imply that kpf is very species dependent and could be attributed to the difference in light intensity intensity of heat and water stresses and canopy structure the increase in wuebiomass of ats treated plants might be because the accumulated tdm was not affected by ats treatment while total wc was reduced although statistically significant only in case of kpf in case of kpf 10 8 of water volumes were conserved with a non significant increase in the accumulated tdm consequently wuebiomass was increased by about 29 4 and 13 3 for the r123 and s156 genotype respectively the improvements in wuebiomass under non water stressed conditions following kfp treatment has been reported for beans boari et al 2015 grape vine brillante et al 2016 glenn 2010 and tomato abdallah et al 2018 but a decrease in wue for apple was observed glenn et al 2003 the root analyses demonstrated a genotypic and ats treatments effects the s156 line has thinner and longer very fine roots vfr than the r123 line with a balancing shorter length of the meso diameter class 2 mdc 2 roots as if carbohydrates are being shifted from one class of root to another class the s156 plants treated with pin have significantly 15 shorter and thicker mdc 1 roots while other treatments kpf and fa have only a slight thickening of the s156 plant mdc 1 roots 12 and 10 or roughly 1 2 cells it was hypothesized that the reduction of transpiration induced by the three different treatment mechanisms should have led the treated plants to develop thicker and shorter mdc 1 roots by the simple concept that a need for less water would reduce the demand for thinner and longer roots with the exception of the pin treatment that showed a genotypic specific effect this hypothesis is supported also the data for the mdc 2 roots confirm and extend this assessment the r123 plant mdc 2 roots are thicker table 2 and shorter than the s156 plant mdc 2 roots moreover the ammi interaction analysis demonstrates that both kpf and fa treatments condition larger diameter roots compared to control with kpf having the stronger effect ia 1 21 of the interaction variance fig 8 meanwhile pin has no effect on fine and v fine root diameter with the r123 line but has a strong root thickening effect on the s156 line the observed response of s156 plants to pin treatment by developing shorter and thicker vfr and longer fr suggests a strong interaction between the genotype of the s156 plant and pin application to the leaves we believe this is the first report of such an interaction it is suggested that future research with ats must take root responses into account 5 conclusion in the current study the use of kaolin particle film kpf reduced leaf temperature at mid day enhanced plant water relations and reduced water consumption of the two tested snap beans through transpiration reduction without negative effects on both total dry matter and dry matter accumulation rate thus wuebiomass increased by 29 4 and 13 3 for r123 and s156 genotypes respectively compared to control plants kaolin particle film was superior to pinolene and fulvic acid in terms of water saving and wue therefor kpf treated plants survived longer compared with the other ats and the control kpf could be efficiently utilized as ats to reduce transpiration and to conserve water in the soil for a longer time by the simple concept that a need for less water would reduce the demand for thinner and longer roots the reduction of transpiration induced by ats led the treated plants to develop thicker and shorter very fine roots particularly in the case of kpf among the tested ats the application of kpf may alleviate the adverse effect of water deficit or drought by reducing transpiration consequently reducing wc and conserving water earlier after irrigation to be available later thus kpf could reduce irrigation frequency increase plant survival future in field investigation is critical to better understand root responses to ats foliar application and

11148,enhancing water use efficiency wue while maintaining productivity represents a challenge particularly in arid and semi arid environments the use antitranspirants ats is an effective approach to mitigate water deficit and drought induced yield losses via reducing transpiration this study aimed to determine the effects of ats compounds on wue and root and shoot physiological responses of two snap bean genotypes with different ozone sensitivity tolerant r123 and sensitive s156 under glasshouse conditions plants were sprayed 25 days after planting with 4 w v kaolin kpf 0 0015 w v fulvic acid fa 1 v v pinolene pin or water control treatments were subjected to three irrigation drying cycles and then exposed to survivability test by ceasing irrigation water consumption wc leaf water potential ψw total dry matter tdm dry matter accumulation rate dmar leaf temperature plant survival and root development were determined there was a minimal genotype effect on all parameters except tdm dmar and fine root diameter and length kpf treatment was cooler than the control 3 83 c consequently had higher ψw and lower wc without affecting tdm and dmar therefore biomass wue total dry matter transpired water of kpf treatment increased 29 4 and 13 3 for r123 and s156 respectively pinolene and fa treatments exerted no effects on those parameters kpf treatment alleviated most of the physiological effects of water deficit hence plants survived longer kpf and fa treatments had thicker very fine 0 0726 to 0 29 mm and fine 0 308 to 0 562 mm roots than the control with kpf having the strongest effect on roots development pinolene treatment showed no effect on the roots of r123 but conditioned significant thickening of s156 roots a notable reversal of the observed effect of kpf and fa in conclusion conserved water by kpf could reduce irrigation frequency and later play as a crucial water resource for plant survival moreover future research with ats must take root responses into account keywords transpiration kaolin pinolene water use efficiency fine roots very fine roots 1 introduction in the future crop production will be more difficult under climate change due to global warming more frequent droughts and heat waves medrano et al 2015b vicente serrano et al 2014 world water assessment programme 2012 furthermore water scarcity is exacerbated by the expected increase in the world population wallace 2000 which leads to a decline in the available water capita as well as water available for agriculture consequently irrigated agriculture will take place under water deficit fao 2016 sposito 2013 and plants might be subjected to short or long drought periods geerts and raes 2009 leading to yield losses due to these major changes climate change and increased water scarcity irrigation water management will alter towards maximizing crop production per water unit increasing water use efficiency wue rather than optimizing crop production per land unit fereres and soriano 2007 pascale et al 2011 for the aforementioned reasons optimizing wue is a crucial goal to ensure food security particularly in arid and semi arid regions where water resources are limited boari et al 2015 bodner et al 2015 medrano et al 2015b however saving water for the purpose of wue optimization cannot be made at the expense of yield and or fruit quality in order to secure economical sustainability for producers brillante et al 2016 several materials known as antitranspirants ats are able to mitigate water deficit drought stress or salinity stress via reducing leaf water losses reducing transpiration consequently soil moisture could be preserved for longer periods thus postponing the onset of drought abdullah et al 2015 boari et al 2016 2015 goreta et al 2007 three types of ats are currently available anderson and kreith 1978 the first class is bio chemical active compounds metabolic inhibitors such as abscisic acid aba and fulvic acid fa their application reduces transpiration by preventing the stomata from fully opening anjum et al 2011 wang et al 2003 zhang et al 2016 for example exogenous application of aba was found to reduce transpiration and enhance drought tolerance in several plant species al absi 2009 du et al 2013 kondo et al 2012 waterland et al 2010 the second ats class includes film forming materials which mechanically limits plant transpiration by hindering water vapor escape from the leaves to the atmosphere gu et al 1998 for instance di 1 p menthene c20h34 a terpenic polymer commonly named pinolene pin derived from pine resin is used as a film forming antitranspirant del amor et al 2010 indicated that pin application at 2 5 v v improved drought tolerance in sweet pepper plants the third class is the reflective materials known as particle film technology glenn and puterka 2005 this approach involves spraying lime calcium sulphate or engineered processed clays such as kaolin aluminum phyllosilicate al2si2o5 oh 4 to cover plant leaves with thin films of nanoparticles boari et al 2016 2015 2014 glenn et al 2003 2001 glenn and puterka 2005 kaolin is a wettable hydrophobic non abrasive and non toxic clay mineral with a particle diameter of 2 μm glenn and puterka 2005 cantore et al 2009 heating kaolin converts the silicate to white which greatly increases its light reflectance properties brillante et al 2016 glenn et al 2001 therefore kaolin on plant leaves creates a film of white nanoparticles that partially reflects ultraviolet ut and infrared ir radiation lowering canopy temperature and reducing transpiration glenn and puterka 2005 this property has been effectively used in horticulture to prevent fruits sunburn cantore et al 2009 recently kpf has been proposed as a supplemental tool to save water and to protect plants against drought stress on several species e g clementine oranges and tomatoes abdallah et al 2018 boari et al 2015 cantore et al 2009 fruit trees coniberti et al 2013 dinis et al 2016 glenn 2012 shellie et al 2013 numerous studies showed an increase in yield and fruit quality of different crops treated with kpf boari et al 2014 coniberti et al 2013 dinis et al 2016 ergun 2012 glenn 2012 glenn et al 2003 2001 glenn and puterka 2007 khaleghi et al 2015 shellie et al 2013 shellie and king 2013 however there are studies showed no effects of kpf on fruit yield and quality kahn and damicone 2008 schupp et al 2002 a controversy over kpf effects on leaf gas exchange and carbon c assimilation rate has been reported some authors reported no negative effect or even found an increase in c assimilation and stomatal conductance boari et al 2014 coniberti et al 2013 dinis et al 2016 ergun 2012 glenn 2012 shellie et al 2013 shellie and king 2013 steiman et al 2007 while others observed a reduction cantore et al 2009 the ats differ in their longevity duration of effectiveness which determines its spraying frequency davenport et al 1969 the effect of metabolic ats are usually short lived compared to other ats types al absi and archbold 2016 anderson and kreith 1978 kreith et al 1975 the durability of film forming ats is dependent on plant species film type concentration and environmental conditions anderson and kreith 1978 davies and k t 1974 kreith et al 1975 mohawesh et al 2010 on the other hand the reflective ats could be long lasting unless they are washed out by rain water cantore et al 2009 davenport et al 1969 reported that the duration of ats effectiveness is a function of durability of the material spraying operation environmental conditions i e precipitation temperature and humidity and the amount of newly emerged leaves after last ats foliar application it is well established that plants under environmental changes can modify the development of fine fr 0 308 to 0 562 mm and very fine vfr 0 0726 to 0 29 mm roots zobel 2003 2016 2013 zobel et al 2007 2006 however no literature has investigated yet the root responses to treating plant leaves with ats if ats treatment modifies transpiration over time it is expected that the plant may modify its root system accordingly a suitable hypothesis would be in the presence of an effective antitranspirant the demand for water from the roots would reduce resulting in developing roots that are less efficient in water uptake i e thicker and or shorter roots while utilizing less carbohydrates for construction and maintenance the two snap bean phaseolus vulgaris l lines s156 and r123 are ozone sensitive tolerant genotypes respectively commonly used as an ozone bio indicator system burkey et al 2005 while differing in ozone response s156 and r123 have similar rates of stomatal conductance flowers et al 2007 and transpiration fiscus et al 2012 given that these snap bean genotypes are well characterized in terms of leaf physiology this system provides a good set of plant material to determine the influence of different ats on whole plant water consumption most ats studies were conducted under drought stress or water deficit few studies looked at how water consumption changes along the irrigation drying cycle of the ats treated plants in addition fewer studied examined the survival of the ats treated plants under extreme drought to our knowledge no study has yet investigated the effects of ats on water consumption wue physiological performance and root development of snap beans under well irrigated conditions therefore the main objectives of this work were to 1 assess changes in daily water consumption prior the application of three ats that differ in their mode of actions by two snap beans genotypes that differ in their response to ozone 2 characterize how ats compounds function under sufficient water supply and under severe water deficit 3 assess the long survival of ats treated plants relative to the control plants and 4 assess the modification development of fr and vfr after ats application 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental conditions this study was carried out in a glasshouse located in the usda ars plant science research unit raleigh north carolina usa the greenhouse temperature and relative humidity rh were 28 3 c and 70 3 with ambient light levels seeds of ozone sensitive s156 and ozone tolerant r123 lines of snap bean phaseolus vulgaris l were used for this study two seeds were sown 5 cm apart at a depth of 3 cm near to the center of each 15 l pot with a surface diameter of 25 cm each pot was filled with 1300 g of fafard 2 pro mix fafard anderson sc usa recommended rates of slow release fertilizer osmocote plus scotts sierra horticultural products marysville oh usa 15 9 12 n p k was thoroughly mixed in the planting media at the time of planting seedlings were thinned to one plant per pot upon full expansion of the first trifoliate leaf during the initial growth period plants were regularly irrigated every two days and not subjected to water deficit by keeping the moisture content around the field capacity 2 2 treatments treatments consisted of two snap bean genotypes as a main factor combined with the application of three different ats the investigated ats have been selected based upon published toxicity efficiency and availability anjum et al 2011 brillante et al 2016 del amor et al 2010 glenn et al 2003 the most uniform snap bean plants representing each cultivar 25 days after planting were selected for the ats treatments the foliage of individual plants was sprayed to complete coverage with one of three ats treatments i 4 w v kaolin particle film kpf surround wp crop

meanwhile control plants were sprayed with water after ats application pots were arranged in a completely randomized block design with three replicates then plants were subjected to three irrigation drying cycles with a drying interval of 5 days imposed the pots were rotated within the glasshouse at each irrigation event to ensure that plants have similar micro climatic uniform distribution of light and air at each irrigation event plants were irrigated until soil reached field capacity this was done by placing each pot perforated from the bottom in a saucer of water to allow soil saturation from the bottom via capillary rise when the soils were saturated the saucers were removed and excess water drained gravimetrically overnight until pots showed negligible drainage agaba et al 2010 chen et al 2003 to prevent evaporation from soil surface each pot was carefully placed in a white plastic bag gently tied around the stem base shi et al 2010 therefore in the current study water loss was mainly via plant transpiration to estimate the daily water consumption mm d 1 the daily weight loss from pots together with the plant was gravimetrically determined every morning 9 00 abdullah et al 2015 chen et al 2003 plants received the second irrigation when the control plants depleted 50 of available water capacity additionally plant water consumption for each irrigation drying cycle and over the three irrigation drying cycles was calculated following the initiation of the third irrigation event plants were allowed to consume the available water and then harvested following plant death and the survival time days was determined plant survival was monitored daily by observing the color change of leaves and stems plants were declared dead when the leaves and stems turned from green to brown leaves began to abscise and branches became brittle yang et al 2014 the total time to reach death was considered as the survival time hüttermann et al 1999 the harvested plants were divided into shoots and roots and have been dried separately in the oven for two days at 70 c until a constant weight was recorded then total dry matter tdm was determined and dry matter accumulation rate dmar was calculated 2 3 root harvest roots were harvested by carefully removing potting soil followed by an initial wash in tap water and a final rinse in clean tap water to remove a majority of debris from fine roots paper towels were used to remove excess water from processed root systems the entire root system was cut into small segments a few cm in length and a random one g sample stored in a tube with faa fixative 50 ethanol 5 acetic acid and 3 8 formaldehyde in distilled de ionized water for measurements of root diameter the remaining root material was dried at 70 c 2 4 measurements 2 4 1 leaf water potential ψw leaf water potential was measured on the last day of the first irrigation drying cycle after 5 days of ats application two recent fully expanded mature leaves on each replicate were measured using a pressure bomb model 610 pms instruments corvallis or usa as described by turner 1988 measurements were taken between 10 a m and 12 p m each leaf was cut at the petiole base and immediately placed in the pressure chamber with about 5 mm of the cut end of the petiole protruding through the compressible rubber gland used to seal the chamber compressed breathing air was released into the chamber until the sap returned to the cut end of the xylem and the pressure required mpa was recorded 2 4 2 leaf temperature leaf temperature lt 0 5 c at 25 c was measured using infrared thermometer omegaette os542 infrared thermometer omega engineering inc norwalk ct 06854 on the last day fifth day of the first irrigation drying cycle measurements were performed three times day morning 9 00 10 00 mid day 13 00 14 00 and after noon 17 00 18 00 2 4 3 total chlorophyll leaf greenness was measured as an indicator for the total chlorophyll content using the at leaf chlorophyll meter ft green llc wilmington de leaf greenness was measured on the 5th day of the first irrigation drying cycle 2 4 4 root measurements roots were stained with toluidine blue o 1 removed from vials carefully spread out in glass bottomed trays and the trays were placed on an epson v850 pro scanner and scanned transmission at 55px mm 1 1400 dpi using greyscale imaging the resulting images were edited using photoshop to remove the large amounts of detritus materials remaining from potting soil used for this experiment most root samples were cleaned up well but the roots of the control and pin treated r123 plants were especially difficult after imaging the images were analyzed with winrhizo software arabidopsis version the very fine roots vfr occupy meso diameter class mdc 1 between 0 0726 and 0 29 mm diameter and the fine roots fr occupy a meso diameter class mdc 2 between 0 308 and 0 562 mm diameter 2 4 5 water use efficiency biomass water use efficiency

plants with the ats five uniform plants of each cultivar were harvested and dried then the initial total dry weight tdw g was recorded similarly final tdw was measured after harvesting the treatments in the current study wuebiomass g mm 1 was calculated as the ratio between accumulated total dry matter g and the total wc mm over the three irrigation drying cycles w u e b i o m a s s f i n a l t d

variance using the two way factorial design in glmmix procedure in sas 9 4 sas inc cary nc usa significant effects and interactions were determined at significance level of 5 p 0 05 and compared using to tukey s test statistical tests for the root analyses were carried out using the ammi analysis zobel et al 1988 in the r statistical package http r project org to give a high resolution interaction analysis 3 results 3 1 leaf temperature overall lt increased from morning 9 00 10 00 towards the solar zenith 13 00 14 00 and declined in the afternoon 17 00 18 00 analyzing the data for the two genotypes the two way model anova revealed no significant differences in lt neither in the morning nor the afternoon data not shown among genotypes p 0 2658 and 0 4351 respectively or ats p 0 2704 and 0 1601 respectively however significant p 0 05 differences in lt were observed among treatments only at mid day as lt of r123 genotype was significantly p 0 0073 higher than s156 genotype nevertheless when mid day lt data were pooled by the ats fig 1 a significant differences p 0001 were observed pinolene application significantly increased lt by 1 87 and 5 16 c as compared to the control and the kpf respectively but there was no significant difference between pin and fa treated leaves on the other hand kpf treated plants were significantly cooler 3 83 c than the control the results of lt in the morning mid day and afternoon were analyzed separately a significant ats by genotype interaction p 0 0126 was observed only at mid day fig 2 the presence of kpf significantly reduced lt for both genotypes as compared to the control pin and fa kpf treated plants were cooler than the control plants by 4 56 c and 3 10 c for the r123 and s156 genotypes respectively no significant differences were recorded among the pin fa and the control in case of r123 this contrasted with s156 where pin application increased lt compared to the control while no differences were observed between pin and fa 3 2 leaf water potential ψw the effect of the genotype on ψw was minimal and there were no significant differences p 0 2032 between the two tested genotypes data not shown moreover the interaction between the genotype and ats was also not significant p 0 9286 when data pooled by ats kpf and fa treatments significantly increased ψw with respect to the control fig 1b no significant difference was observed between pin treatment and the control kpf treated plants had significantly p 0 05 higher ψw values than pin fa and control 3 3 chlorophyll content total dry matter and dry matter accumulation rate the effect of genotype and ats treatments and their interaction on total chlorophyll content data not shown was not significant p 0 8655 0 9804 and 0 3870 respectively the results of tdm and dmar showed significant p 0001 in both cases genotype differences with r123 being a larger plant 46 59 g for r123 and 30 81 g for s156 that accumulated dry matter at a higher rate than s156 2 39 g d 1 for r123 and 1 59 g d 1 for s156 there were no significant ats effects summing the data by ats or ats by genotype interactions fig 3 3 4 plant water consumption wc generally total wc over the three irrigation drying cycles was significantly affected by the selected ats a significant p 0 0001 reduction in wc was observed for the kpf treated plants when data were pooled over the ats while pin and fa treatments were not different from the control fig 4 total wc reduced by 10 73 3 4 and 2 55 for kpf pin and fa respectively relative to control plants the genotype had no significant effect p 0 9466 on wc data not shown for example when summing over ats treatments wc during the first irrigation drying cycle was almost identical for the two genotypes 12 34 and 12 24 mm d 1 for the r123 and s156 genotypes respectively in the first irrigation drying cycle when data were pooled by ats treatment kpf significantly p 0 0001 reduced wc by 2 1 mm d 1 15 6 relative to the control plants in which the relative wc was 84 4 minor insignificant reductions were also recorded for both pin and fa fig 5 no genotype by ats interaction was observed data not shown similar trends were observed in the second irrigation draying cycle whereas the relative water consumption was significantly p 0 0001 lower by 16 for the kpf treated plants during the third irrigation drying cycle the relative wc was not significantly affected by the ats as plants were subjected to a survivability test allowing them to consume all water available in the root zone fig 5 regarding the pattern of the daily wc curves fig 6 results of both genotypes showed that wc of kpf treated plants was consistently lower early in the irrigation drying cycles than control pin and fa treated plants the opposite was observed on the final day of each irrigation drying cycle in which wc was higher in the kpf treated plants indicating that water conserved earlier in the cycle was now available while plants subjected to other treatments were under water stress water conservation under the kpf treatment allowed plant survival for 6 days during the third irrigation drying cycle while plants subjected to other treatment survived only 5 days fig 6 3 5 biomass water use efficiency wuebiomass the results showed wuebiomass to be affected by its two components accumulated dry matter and consumed water biomass wue of r123 genotype was significantly p 0 0001 higher than wuebiomass of the s156 genotype 0 203 g mm 1 for r123 and 0 135 g mm 1 for s156 no significant p 0 2625 genotype by ats interaction was observed when data were pooled by ats fig 4 kpf treated plants found to be significantly p 0 0464 higher than the control and other ats treatments 3 6 root diameter class and diameter class length effects a histogram of the length of root diameter classes fig 7 shows that both treatment and genotype s s156 and r r123 lines produce different histogram patterns the very fine roots vfr occupy meso diameter class mdc 1 between 0 0726 and 0 29 mm diameter and the fine roots fr occupy a meso diameter class mdc 2 between 0 308 and 0 562 mm diameter fig 7 shows that the s156 cultivar roots control cs kpf treated s156 kpf s and fulvic acid s156 fa s have peak diameter class lengths dcls that are longer higher peak and diameter classes dcs thinner smaller dcs than the treated r123 plants kpf treated r123 kpf r and fulvic acid treated r123 fa r the histogram and a nonlinear curve fitting using a gaussian model table 1 also suggests that the kpf pin and fa treatments stimulated a slight thickening 12 for kpf s 15 for pin s and 10 for fa s of the vfr roots of the s156 plants reflected in the shift in root diameter at maximum peak height mdc 1 in table 1 although the pattern for the control r123 cr and pin treated r123 pin r is difficult to analyze visually because of the effects of increased detritus in the washed root images of the r123 plants pin unexpectedly showed longer vfr with no effect on their diameter results of the second root meso diameter class mdc 2 showed that control plants of r123 had longer mdc 2 roots than s156 fig 7 for the two genotypes fa and kpf had no significant effect on mdc 2 roots on the other hand pin showed genotype specific effects on mdc 2 where the application of pin to bean plant leaves resulted in shorter mdc 2 roots of the r123 plants and longer mdc 2 roots of the s156 plants the ammi interaction analysis determined that two singular values two interaction axes ia table 2 were significant the biplot of these two axes fig 8 demonstrates that both kpf and fa treatments condition larger diameter roots compared to the control with kpf having the stronger effect ia 1 21 of the interaction variance fig 8 the first axis also demonstrates that pin has no effect on fine and v fine root diameter with the r123 line but has a strong root thickening effect on the s156 line the second axis 17 of the interaction variation demonstrates a clear separation of r123 and s156 and is best explained as the effect of the detritus which was prevalent in pin r c r and fa r with little or no detritus and therefore little or no impact on c s fa s and kpf s the remainder of the interaction variation was identified as noise 4 discussion in the current study we investigated the effect of different ats on the physiological performance pattern of water consumption wuebiomass and root development of two snap beans lines for three irrigation drying cycles a novelty of this work is the study of root response by two snap beans lines differing in their ozone sensitivity to foliar application of three ats with different mode of actions the effect of the investigated ats was clearly observed through lt measurements particularly at mid day the superiority of kpf over the pin and fa in reducing lt might be attributed to the white kpf ability to reflect the ut and ir glenn and puterka 2005 meanwhile the significant lt increase of pin treated plants at mid day could be due to the reduction of evaporative cooling because of the transpiration reduction faralli et al 2016 the significant reduction in canopy and or leaf temperature due to kpf application was previously observed abdallah 2017 boari et al 2015 bodner et al 2015 glenn 2010 jifon and syvertsen 2003 medrano et al 2015b shellie and king 2013 for example glenn 2016 indicated that canopy temperature was significantly lower for kpf treatment 24 c compared to the control 26 c the lt increase of pin treated leaves support the results of brillante et al 2016 in which they reported that pin treatment had significantly warmer leaves 1 19 c and 1 43 c higher than control and kpf respectively in the morning and late afternoon when irradiance levels were lower all plants almost had the same lt indicating that kpf treatment was most effective when energy input light intensity was greatest at mid day our results were supported with those of abdallah et al 2018 glenn 2010 glenn et al 2001 in which they indicated that the temperature difference between kpf treated and non treated plants increases towards the solar zenith 13 00 15 00 and decreasing in the morning and in the afternoon however brillante et al 2016 and cantore et al 2009 found an increase of 1 5 c in grapevines and 1 c in tomato sprayed with kpf only when photosynthetic photon flux density ppfd is low indicating that the kpf effect is light intensity dependent it could be concluded that as kpf acts on lt by light reflection its effect could be reduced or even negligible when the ppfd is low in less irradiant times or environments in less irradiant times or environments kpf could reduce gas exchange by limiting transpiration possibly due to stomatal blockage therefore it causes a contemporary increase in heating plant leaves brillante et al 2016 however when ppfd is high the highly reflective properties of kpf result in a leaf and canopy temperature less than the untreated plants therefore kpf would reduce ct and thus transpiration rate more than photosynthesis in plants grown only at high solar radiation levels the reflective nature of kpf which may have reduced the absorption of radiant energy particularly at mid day not only reduced the lt but also regulated transpiration resulting in significant improvements in plant water relations of kpf treated plants the positive effect of kpf treated plants in ψw was also reported in several studies shellie and glenn 2008 glenn et al 2010 boari et al 2014 2015 brillante et al 2016 indicating that kpf could be a promising tool for regulating transpiration to maintain a favorable plant water status contrary goreta et al 2007 found that kpf did not inﬂuence plant water relations in addition shellie 2015 indicated that vine water status differed by irrigation amount and among years but was not significantly influenced by kpf treatment the absence of the significant effect of pin treatment on ψw is in agreement with brillante et al 2016 in which pin application did not significantly enhance plant water relations of grapevines the inconsistency among studies regarding the effect of ats on plant water relations could be explained by utilizing different plant species environment and to the severity of heat and water stresses the reduction in wc of kpf treated plants relative to the control might be due to the reduction in transpiration as evaporation was minimized through covering the pots with white plastic bags the significant wc reduction of kpf treated plants might be attributed to the reduction in lt consequently potential transpiration boari et al 2015 bodner et al 2015 glenn 2010 jifon and syvertsen 2003 medrano et al 2015b additionally the pattern of daily wc of kpf treated plants was less early in the three irrigation drying cycles than control and other ats treatments however on the last day of each irrigation drying cycle an opposite trend was observed where wc of kpf treatment was higher indicating that water conserved earlier in each cycle irrigation drying cycle was later available while plants subjected to other treatments were water stressed at the end of each irrigation drying cycle therefore the water conservation under the kpf treatment allowed plant survival for 6 days during the third irrigation drying cycle while plants subjected to other treatment survived only 5 days fig 6 the wc reduction of kpf treated plants observed herein is in agreement with the results reported for well watered bean crop boari et al 2015 as well as for other species including vine brillante et al 2016 tomato cantore et al 2009 where the evapotranspiration was reduced by 20 and strawberry santos et al 2012 in which plant water requirements were reduced by 30 during plant establishment kpf results disagreed with those of al absi and archbold 2016 who indicated that the use of kpf did not alleviate water deficit stress in apple seedlings the absence of pin effect on reducing wc might be due to a limited duration of the films davies and k t 1974 mohawesh et al 2010 this lack of significance pin effect was also supported by brillante et al 2016 in which they found that pin application did not significantly reduce the plant wc in vines in contrast faralli et al 2016 reported that the application of pin may be a useful crop management tool to avoid severe drought induced yield losses in oilseed rape moreover the lack of fa effect observed in the current study was in contrast to anjum et al 2011 who showed that fa application 1 5 mg l 1 on maize significantly improved crop performance under both drought and well watered conditions generally the use of ats could reduce wc but the effectiveness appears to be dependent upon the crop species of interest and the severity of heat and water stresses it is well established that reductions in photosynthesis lead to declines in shoot biomass supporting the use of tdm to approximate carbon c assimilation medrano et al 2015a consequently the non significant effect of ats on tdm observed in this study suggest that the tested ats had no effect on c assimilation the non significant effect of pin on c assimilation is in agreement with the findings of faralli et al 2016 in which they reported that c assimilation rate was sustained after the application of two film forming ats poly 1 p menthene and di 1 p menthene opposite results were reported by others papers brillante et al 2016 del amor et al 2010 palliotti et al 2010 where the use of pin caused a decline in c assimilation our results regarding fa were similar to those obtained by anjum et al 2011 in which they demonstrated that c assimilation was sustained under fa application regarding the impact of kpf on plant photosynthesis some authors reported that kpf reduced heat stress without negatively affecting c assimilation abdallah et al 2018 boari et al 2015 brillante et al 2016 moreover glenn et al 2001 and shellie and glenn 2008 reported an increase in gas exchange in apple and wine grape respectively and reported microscope photography showing open stomata in kpf sprayed leaves at the leaf level kpf treatment could reduce the net photosynthesis by the partial light reflection wünsche et al 2004 however the light reflection into the interior of the canopy could enhance diffusion of par together with the reduction in canopy temperature consequently increasing the whole canopy photosynthesis glenn 2010 2009 glenn et al 2003 others researchers found reductions in stomatal conductance indicating that kpf treatment reduced the light available to the leaf by increasing light reflection wünsche et al 2004 pace et al 2007 cantore et al 2009 shellie 2015 resulting in a reduction c assimilation under optimum irrigation but improved c assimilation under deficit irrigation cantore et al 2009 the inconsistency of kpf effects among different studies could imply that kpf is very species dependent and could be attributed to the difference in light intensity intensity of heat and water stresses and canopy structure the increase in wuebiomass of ats treated plants might be because the accumulated tdm was not affected by ats treatment while total wc was reduced although statistically significant only in case of kpf in case of kpf 10 8 of water volumes were conserved with a non significant increase in the accumulated tdm consequently wuebiomass was increased by about 29 4 and 13 3 for the r123 and s156 genotype respectively the improvements in wuebiomass under non water stressed conditions following kfp treatment has been reported for beans boari et al 2015 grape vine brillante et al 2016 glenn 2010 and tomato abdallah et al 2018 but a decrease in wue for apple was observed glenn et al 2003 the root analyses demonstrated a genotypic and ats treatments effects the s156 line has thinner and longer very fine roots vfr than the r123 line with a balancing shorter length of the meso diameter class 2 mdc 2 roots as if carbohydrates are being shifted from one class of root to another class the s156 plants treated with pin have significantly 15 shorter and thicker mdc 1 roots while other treatments kpf and fa have only a slight thickening of the s156 plant mdc 1 roots 12 and 10 or roughly 1 2 cells it was hypothesized that the reduction of transpiration induced by the three different treatment mechanisms should have led the treated plants to develop thicker and shorter mdc 1 roots by the simple concept that a need for less water would reduce the demand for thinner and longer roots with the exception of the pin treatment that showed a genotypic specific effect this hypothesis is supported also the data for the mdc 2 roots confirm and extend this assessment the r123 plant mdc 2 roots are thicker table 2 and shorter than the s156 plant mdc 2 roots moreover the ammi interaction analysis demonstrates that both kpf and fa treatments condition larger diameter roots compared to control with kpf having the stronger effect ia 1 21 of the interaction variance fig 8 meanwhile pin has no effect on fine and v fine root diameter with the r123 line but has a strong root thickening effect on the s156 line the observed response of s156 plants to pin treatment by developing shorter and thicker vfr and longer fr suggests a strong interaction between the genotype of the s156 plant and pin application to the leaves we believe this is the first report of such an interaction it is suggested that future research with ats must take root responses into account 5 conclusion in the current study the use of kaolin particle film kpf reduced leaf temperature at mid day enhanced plant water relations and reduced water consumption of the two tested snap beans through transpiration reduction without negative effects on both total dry matter and dry matter accumulation rate thus wuebiomass increased by 29 4 and 13 3 for r123 and s156 genotypes respectively compared to control plants kaolin particle film was superior to pinolene and fulvic acid in terms of water saving and wue therefor kpf treated plants survived longer compared with the other ats and the control kpf could be efficiently utilized as ats to reduce transpiration and to conserve water in the soil for a longer time by the simple concept that a need for less water would reduce the demand for thinner and longer roots the reduction of transpiration induced by ats led the treated plants to develop thicker and shorter very fine roots particularly in the case of kpf among the tested ats the application of kpf may alleviate the adverse effect of water deficit or drought by reducing transpiration consequently reducing wc and conserving water earlier after irrigation to be available later thus kpf could reduce irrigation frequency increase plant survival future in field investigation is critical to better understand root responses to ats foliar application and

11149,the arid forests of abu dhabi are valuable but they require irrigating currently groundwater gw is the source of this water but these subterranean reserves are being over exploited law no 5 of 2016 on the regulation of gw has been passed by the government of abu dhabi to reduce gw abstraction abu dhabi has a supply of tertiary treated sewage effluent tse that could be used as an alternative for irrigation we set up experiments near madinat zayed in the al dhafra region of abu dhabi on two arid forest species al ghaf prosopis cineraria and al sidr ziziphus spina christi the trees were planted at 8 m x 8 m spacing the tse is significantly sweeter than gw as its electrical conductivity is 1 ds m 1 whereas gw is 8 10 ds m 1 the gw in this region is very high in nitrates 38 4 9 2 mg no3 l 1 and this was not significantly different from the tse 53 7 11 8 mg no3 l 1 we monitored the actual tree water use etc l h 1 via heat pulse devices in both the gw and tse irrigated trees we quantified the differences in the etc patterns for both the gw and tse irrigated trees of both species over 3 years both species showed positive growth responses to tse relative to the gw and we consider this to be due to the lower electrical conductivity of the tse water because of this growth response the etc of the tse by the ghaf trees was on annual average 17 higher than gw and for the sidr it was 39 our results were corroborated by leaf conductance and leaf area inferences but for tse there is no need for a salt leaching fraction furthermore to achieve the same tree health outcome as with the gw even less tse need be applied irrigation requirements for tse were at least 25 less than for gw keywords saline groundwater treated sewage effluent arid forests irrigation environmental regulations crop factor 1 introduction abu dhabi s arid forests are located in a hyper arid desert where annual precipitation is less than 50 mm and annual potential evapotranspiration exceeds 2000 mm despite these harsh desert conditions the first president of the united arab emirates uae h h sheikh zayed al nahyan sought to establish many forests to realise the valuable ecosystem services delivered by the trees this greening of the desert began in the 1970s abu dhabi s forests now cover about 3 5 of the emirate the total number of trees is around 20 million trees and thanks to irrigation with groundwater gw some 80 of these forests are classified in good condition the annual gw consumption for irrigation of the current forests is estimated to be about one quarter of total gw extractions meanwhile conserving gw is imperative for food security cultural heritage and the environment of abu dhabi in november 2016 the general secretariat of the executive council of the abu dhabi government issued law no 5 officially declaring that the emirate of abu dhabi owns the gw reserves and that its extraction and use would be governed by the rules standards and conditions set out by environment agency abu dhabi ead law no 5 will help to manage the demand for gw and ensure reserves into the future ead 2017 in an earlier paper al yamani et al 2018 we described our experiments on the irrigation of al ghaf and al sidr by saline gw with an electrical conductivity ec of 8 10 ds m 1 from our results and analyses we provided ead with new gw irrigation allocations for law 5 based on direct measurements of tree water use etc plus a factor of safety of 25 and a salt leaching fraction of 25 al yamani et al 2018 adoption of this allocation regime will result in gw savings of up to 40 in forest irrigation 1 1 treated sewage effluent however even greater savings are required to protect gw reserves so the abu dhabi government has recently started new initiatives to understand better the status and the pressure on the more than 100 000 groundwater wells in the emirate this strategic assessment now involves seeking ways to reduce pressure on gw by finding alternative sources for irrigation the uae has been collecting and treating sewage since 1973 and this tertiary treated tse is derived from desalinated water across the hyper arid states of the gulf cooperation council gcc there is an emerging interest in using tse for irrigation in agriculture and for its use in watering amenity plantings al a ama and nakhla 1995 al zubari 1998 treated sewage effluent is sweeter than gw in the sense of salt the ec of tse is generally 1 ds m 1 some tenfold lower than gw the tse comes from residential and municipal sources trade water use plus some storm water runoff and rainfall there are more than 60 wastewater treatment plants in the uae and the majority of these are in abu dhabi most of these treatment plants use advanced technologies to treat the sewage water to a tertiary level currently some tse is used for irrigation of amenity vegetation but still a significant volume of tse is disposed of into the arabian gulf the government has a plan to achieve full usage of tse for irrigation 1 2 objectives the goal of the work outlined here was to provide ead with guidelines to aid in the implementation of law 5 in terms of irrigation requirements impacts on tree health and gw savings through the use of tse to irrigate two major species of arid forest al ghaf prosopis cineraria and al sidr ziziphus spina christi the research objective was to quantify the water use et c l d 1 or mm d 1 of al ghaf and al sidr trees irrigated with tse so that new allocation guidelines can be developed for law 5 for this alternative water source the et c of the tse irrigated trees is compared to that of those gw trees previously described in al yamani et al 2018 we also sought to determine what controls the differences in the et c between the gw and tse irrigated trees and to quantify the impact of tse on both tree performance and soil health in al yamani et al 2018 we provided irrigation allowances that would minimise the use of gw to irrigate the trees and here we sought to do the same for tse so that maximum benefit can be made of this valuable alternative source of water furthermore we describe the use of our light stick to infer the fractional light interception li of the gw and tse trees this li enables their crop factor k c to be estimated so that the fao 56 model allen et al 1998 can be used to predict the tree s etc simply from the reference evapotranspiration et o using k c et o 2 materials methods the major native species of the hyper arid forests of the abu dhabi desert are the ghaf sidr arak and samr here we discuss irrigation experiments on mature plots of al ghaf and al sidr trees both tree species in our experimental plots were irrigated either with gw or tse 2 1 research site this research was carried out within the khub al dahs forest 23 51 n 53 75 e near madinat zayed in the al dhafra region of the western desert of abu dhabi al yamani et al 2018 have provided a complete description of the site and the experimental set up so only salient details are repeated here the soil is a typic torripsamment mixed hyperthermic soil ad158 ead 2009 shahid et al 2014 it is a deep sandy soil that is widely distributed across 75 of the uae a large proportion of the managed forests in the uae are on this type of soil two experimental sites were established one site consisted of 12 al ghaf trees and the other 12 al sidr trees within each plot six trees in a single row were irrigated with gw and in the neighbouring row six trees were irrigated with tse the botanical details of the ghaf and sidr trees are provided in al yamani et al 2018 also as described in al yamani et al 2018 sapflow sensors were installed in four trees of each treatment to provide a continuous record of the trees transpiration et c l d 1 using the compensation heat pulse velocity method green et al 2003 the sapflow devices were installed in the ghaf trees in december 2014 and during february 2015 for the sidr trees the tse treatments on both tree species began on 18 may 2015 automated irrigation systems were used at both experimental sites to control the irrigation using gw and tse two tanks each of 22 730 litres were located at both the ghaf and sidr sites one tank at both sites was continuously filled with gw having a salinity of 8 10 ds m 1 the other tank at both sites were filled every month with tse provided by the abu dhabi sewerage services company the source of the tse was domestic tse from the city of madinat zayed which has a population of 30 000 the ec of the tse water was always much less than 1 ds m 1 the water from both of these large header tanks was then transferred separately to smaller tanks each of 2273 litres to help with the mixing of the water to reduce salinity variations each system was operated daily for 6 h beginning early in the morning flow meters were used to monitor the applied aliquots of water pressure compensated drippers were used with two 4 l h 1 drippers per tree thus each tree received about 60 l d 1 on each day throughout the year the irrigation strategy was however changed in the last year of the experiment 2017 as we discuss later 2 2 weather monitoring khub al

the gw and tse trees at appropriate times chemical and microbiological analyses on the soil and water sampled were carried out by the commercial company exova ltd in dubai www exova com leaf samples were analysed by united arab emirates university in al ain 2 3 1 gw and tse water analyses there are more than 40 wells in khub al dahs forest the gw in al ghaf experimental site is pumped from a different well than the one in al sidr experimental site water samples were collected directly from dripper outlets while the irrigation was on two water samples were collected from both the gw and tse lines at the al ghaf and al sidr sites in 2015 at the initiation of the tse application and a second sampling was done at the end of 2017 2 3 2 soil analyses the first soil samples labelled as the reference were taken in february 2015 these were taken inside the same forest and close to but just outside of the experimental plots we collected a total of six soil samples three of them were taken directly under the dripper at depths of 10 20 and 40 cm and the other three samples were taken on the edge of the wet zone around the dripper soil samples were collected three more times during the experiments in december 2015 december 2016 and finally in december 2017 these soil samples were also collected from directly under the dripper and at the edge of the wetted zone they were taken from around two guard trees located at the respective ends of the experimental rows so as to avoid disturbing the soil around the experimental trees the guard trees were under the same irrigation regime as the experimental trees 2 3 2 1 chemical analyses after examining the results of the soil chemistry obtained between the guard trees and between the edge of the drip zone and directly under it we decided to group the results as there were no differences between these groupings 2 3 2 2 microbiological analyses laboratory analyses were carried out on these soil samples for enterococci cfu 100 m l 1 faecal coliforms cfu 100 m l 1 and helminth eggs eggs l 1 to assess the risks of the use of tse on human health 2 3 3 leaf analyses leaf samples from al ghaf and al sidr were collected from the experimental trees we took a random selection of leaves about 10 20 from each tree from around each quadrant of each tree leaf sampling was done at four times in 2015 2016 2017 during the period of april june and the final group of samples were taken on december 2017 2 4 leaf conductance a diurnal sequence of leaf conductance g c mmol m 2 s 1 was carried out of the sidr trees on the 26 september 2017 as this was the time at which trees leaf area was near its maximum the measurements were made from mid morning through to mid afternoon using a steady state porometer li 1600 li cor inc lincoln nebraska 68504 5000 usa to measure the g c because of the small and pinnate nature of the leaves of al ghaf it was not possible to measure the g c of those leaves the coriaceous sidr leaves are hypostomatous with the stomata present only on the lower surface of the leaves 2 5 the light stick given the lower ec we anticipated that the tse would most likely have a beneficial impact on tree growth and tree health our measurements of tree water use et c would we hypothesised reflect this change in tree performance however we also sought a simpler means of inferring this response and one that would have greater utility by measuring the tree canopy characteristics that might be affected by tse this would also extend to assess the impact of gws of different salinities lang 1987 developed a method of using the transmittance of the sun s beam through a tree s canopy to infer the canopy leaf area canopy radiation interception can be estimated from static or mobile arrays of quantum sensors using beer s law extending the method of lang and mcmurtrie 1992 we have developed a small hand held light stick that can be used in an understory transit to record the percentage of light being transmitted through the canopy the light intercepted fraction li from these light stick measurements provides a measure of the canopy size and leaf area density the small light stick tranzflo nz ltd palmerston north nz is 200 mm long with 4 equi spaced quantum sensors that are sensitive to photosynthetically active radiation par the light stick was held horizontally just above the sand surface and then in a sweeping motion the interior of each of the tree s shadow area was traversed completely so that the light transmittance could be determined the length and breadth of the perimeter of each tree s shadow area were measured at the same time from time of day the zenith and azimuth angles of the sun are known and it is then possible to compute the effective tree shadow area lang and mcmurtrie 1992 from the light stick s measure of transmittance and given the tree spacing we thus can infer the li fraction by the leaves and woody structures that have intercepted the incoming radiation both the tse and gw trees were measured for both species and this was carried out april may september and december these dates would enable us to capture the changing leaf areas of the trees at the beginning of leaf fall the maximum defoliation and the maximum leaf area respectively the light stick was used here to determine the impact of tse on the changed growth habit of the ghaf and sidr trees that had previously been irrigated with gw also the li is linked here to the crop factor kc we inferred directly from the sap flow measurements 3 results and discussion 3 1 water soil and leaf results 3 1 1 water the main differences between gw and tse waters lay in their salt chemistries the electrical conductivity of the tse was less than 10 of that of the gw the anion and cation chemistries reflected the high content of salts in the gw table 1 interestingly especially from the perspective of plant growth there is no significant difference between the nitrate contents in the gw and tse both were very high and well in excess of health guidelines for potable water fragaszy and mcdonnell 2016 reported that high levels of nitrate occur naturally in the groundwater around liwa due to the low rates of plant uptake high leaching and the accumulation of precipitation derived evaporites 3 1 2 soil 3 1 2 1 chemistry the key results for the salt chemistry found on saturated paste extracts are given in table 2 the salinity and the sodicity sodium adsorption ratio sar values for soil samples taken under al ghaf and al sidr trees are higher in the soil irrigated with gw than in the soil irrigated with tse this is to be expected because of the different salt chemistries of the two irrigation sources table 1 an interesting finding from the soil salinity values is that there is no build up of salinity in the soil around the drippers this confirms the in situ findings using ec probes we described in al yamani et al 2018 the salt leaching fraction of 25 with a factor of safety of 25 appeared effective at leaching the salts from the dripzones of the gw irrigated trees in addition to this salt chemistry we determined the total nitrogen content of the soil wetted by the respective irrigation waters table 3 there were no differences in soil nitrogen content between the gw irrigated soil and the tse irrigated soil and this was the same for both the al ghaf and al sidr trees the high amounts of soil nitrogen reflect the high concentrations of nitrate in both the gw and the tse waters and the similarity in the nitrate concentration between these two irrigation sources thus it is not possible to attribute any differences in plant growth and performance to nitrogen nutrition we also carried out analyses of the soil concentrations of heavy metals and metalloids table 4 the results were equivocal the only differences between the gw and tse soil concentrations for the ghaf were for zinc chromium and fluoride and all were highly statistically significant the only differences between the soils at the sidr site were for chromium low significance and fluoride medium significance in all cases the gw irrigated soil that had the higher concentrations 3 1 2 2 soil microbiology no helminth eggs were found in the wetted soil of either treatment enterococci and faecal coliforms were found in virtually all samples from both treatments there were no significant differences between the concentrations of either the enterococci and faecal coliforms between the gw and tse treatments thus it would seem that the enterococci and faecal coliforms are naturally occurring and not derived from human sources via just the tse this forest is home to herds of desert gazelles and there is abundant bird life these would seem to be the origin of these microbes however both plots had been fenced off for three years so it would seem that the communities of these microbes are now living autonomously in the soil as has been found elsewhere byappanahalli and fujioka 1998 hartz et al 2008 reported on the survival potential of enterococci and faecal coliforms in sub tropical beach sand from our results it now seems that they can also survive in the drip zones of irrigated desert sands the use tse for irrigation of amenity forests would therefore seem not to pose a risk to human health 3 1 3 leaf the bulked results in relation to the leaf macro nutrients are given in table 5 there were no significant differences in p and k values between the irrigation treatments for both al ghaf and al sidr there was a difference of low statistical significance between the leaf n concentrations in al sidr trees but it was the gw irrigated trees that had the higher n amounts thus we conclude that any differences that we observed between the tse and gw irrigated trees were not due to the amounts of nutrients in the tse irrigated trees 3 2 al ghaf transpiration gw and tse sap flow data for the four gw irrigated ghaf trees began on 12 december 2014 and continued over three years through until early 2018 fig 1 the daily measured tree water use values etc l d 1 are presented along with the daily values of the reference evapotranspiration eto mm d 1 the first two years of these data were presented by al yamani et al 2018 and we present the extended three year data set here for completeness to enable comparison with the tse values fig 2 the tse treatment began on 18th may 2015 over the last 7 months of 2015 despite the tse being applied to the treatment trees there was no difference in their etc relative to that of the gw trees both the gw and tse patterns of etc tracked eto however during the early months of 2016 the tse trees etc increased relative to previous tracking with eto and became relatively greater than the etc of the gw trees this divergence became clearer when we calculated and compared the crop factors kc for the gw and tse trees in fig 3 is shown the annual variation in the kc of the gw trees and this data set comprises over 3 years of daily measurements which is one more year than the equivalent data set previously presented by al yamani et al 2018 there was a muted seasonal pattern due to the asynchrony of the deciduous behaviours of the various trees peak leaf area occurred in december january and there was leaf fall in february over the 3 years the annual average kc for the gw trees was 0 110 0 03 n 1127 the annual seasonal patterns in the kc values for the tse trees are shown in fig 4 for the calendar years of 2015 2016 and 2017 unlike for the gw trees fig 3 there was a separation in behaviours between years for the tse trees fig 4 the annual average kc for 2015 for the tse trees was 0 112 0 03 n 309 which was no different from that of the gw trees however in the year after beginning tse irrigation there was greater vegetative vigour and less defoliation especially during january may 2016 the 2016 annual average kc was 0 127 0 027 n 310 which was significantly p 0 001 higher than the 2015 average value for 2017 the annual average kc was 0 129 0 035 n 358 which was not significantly different from the 2016 value thus our sap flow measurements have revealed that tse increased the trees leaf growth such that the kc of the tse trees became 17 higher than that of the gw trees we were not able to discern any visual differences between the treatment trees and this difference was made detectable only through our sap flow measurements 3 3 al sidr transpiration gw and tse our measured etc for each of the four multi stemmed sidr trees was computed using our baseline measurements of sapflow in the four monitored trees of each treatment before we began to analyse the impact of tse on the water use of the sidr trees we re visited the crop factor results of al yamani et al 2018 for the gw irrigated trees al yamani et al 2018 presented the 2015 and 2016 kc data as one here we have split the two years to show the difference in the vegetative vigour between the years fig 5 it can be seen that january to april 2015 was an on fruiting year with low vegetative vigour whereas 2016 was an off fruiting year with high vegetative vigour the fruit when they drop to the ground provide food for the desert gazelles the on off year behaviour in 2015 and 2016 affected the comparison we wished to make with the tse trees immediately upon commencement of the treatment in figs 6 and 7 we present the actual average tree water uses etc l d 1 of the gw and tse sidr trees also shown in these figures are the actual daily amounts of irrigation applied to each of the trees noting that a zero value does not always mean no irrigation because sometimes there was a flowmeter malfunction by comparison of figs 6 and 7 it can be seen that in early 2015 the etc of the tse trees was already greater than that of the gw trees before the tse treatment was commenced on 18th may this difference was due to the lower vegetative vigour of the gw trees in the off fruiting year of 2015 fig 5 during 2016 we provided ead with advice that considered the sustainable irrigation of arid forest trees would be at the rate of 1 5 etc allowing for a factor of safety of 25 and a salt leaching fraction of 25 we decided to test this schedule experimentally on the sidr trees in 2017 figs 6 and 7 shows the reduced rates of irrigation with a summer peak rate of irrigation dropping to about 45 l d 1 thus the 2017 data provide us with a good comparison of the impact of tse on al sidr tree water use over the year from 1 march 2017 to 1 march 2018 we applied an average of 30 l d 1 of irrigation to the gw trees and 33 l d 1 to the tse trees so within our ability to manage the irrigation we essentially applied the same amount of water to both treatments of around 30 l d 1 being half of what is current practice of 60 l d 1 over that year the gw trees transpired on annual average 14 4 3 0 l d 1 whereas the tse trees transpired on average 20 0 7 2 l d 1 a rate that was 39 higher therefore tse irrigation could be even further reduced below 30 l d 1 to achieve a similar tree health outcome as the gw trees in fig 8 we show the seasonal trend in the respective crop factors over 2017 18 for the gw and tse irrigated trees as expected the kc for the tse trees was always higher than that of the gw trees furthermore the deciduous loss of leaves in early april was not as severe for the tse trees and the re emergent leaf growth occurs sooner and more vigorously in may under this reduced irrigation regime the annual average kc for the gw trees was 0 056 whereas it was 0 070 for the tse trees in fig 9 we show the comparison between two trees and their maximum deciduous defoliation tree 5 left is a gw irrigated tree and tree 8 right is tse irrigated there were more viable and greener leaves on the tse tree at this time in fig 10 we show these same two trees at a time when they were approaching their maximum leaf area in late september the greater leaf area of the tse tree is obvious and we draw attention to the differing sizes and light densities of the respective tree shadows 3 4 leaf conductance gc during mid morning to mid afternoon on the 25 september 2017 we carried out measurements of g c on the gw and tse sidr trees for the tse trees we found the average g c to be 17 7 mmol m 2 s 1 se 2 2 n 19 and that for the gw trees was 8 1 mmol m 2 s 1 se 1 5 n 17 the difference was significant p 0 05 the gw trees had a lower g c presumably as a result of their lower and more negative osmotic water potential resulting from the irrigation with more saline groundwater this difference in g c would explain the different tree productivities figs 9 and 10 both these conductance values are very low as befits a xerophytic halophyte like al sidr ziziphus growing under conditions of high temperatures combined with very low atmospheric humidity the relative humidity was around 10 at noon and the air temperatures were 45c arndt et al 2011 reported low g c values for ziziphus rotundafolia growing under controlled conditions in pots for their severe water stress treatment water was withheld and the leaf water potential dropped to 2 mpa after 20 days at which time the osmotic potential was 2 3 mpa between 15 and 28 days they measured the leaf conductance of these stressed ziziphus trees to be between 5 15 mmol m 2 s 1 although our leaf conductance measurements were carried out only over a single day they do indicate that the gw trees were under greater water stress than the tse trees that were irrigated with lower salinity water this difference in stomatal conductance would seem to account for the greater productivity of the tse trees 3 5 light stick and the crop factor the li results are presented in table 6 for the gw irrigated ghaf trees the li was at its lowest of 0 26 0 28 during leaf fall in april may and rose to 0 30 in december at the time of maximum leafiness there was also a seasonal change in the tse irrigated ghaf trees albeit somewhat muted the tse trees had a significantly greater p 0 05 li than the gw trees by 11 a similar seasonal pattern in li was found the sidr trees for both treatments table 6 the li for the tse trees was twice that of the gw trees and this difference was significant p 0 0001 the light stick clearly picked up the leaf growth responses to tse by both species through measuring li however the seasonal changes in li were less than anticipated from our visual observations of the changing leafiness figs 9 and 10 this is due to the characteristic canopy architecture of both species the leaves of al ghaf and al sidr figs 9 and 10 are small and numerous on the many structural branches of the trees so even during leaf fall there was a substantial degree of light interception by the woody branches of the tree fig 9 left this woodiness explains the muted seasonal response in the measured li despite the changing leaf area studies have linked the easily measured value of li to the crop factor kc in order to predict tree water use etc using the inferred kc in the formula etc kc eto the ratio kc li 1 has been found to be in the range of 1 1 2 for well watered horticultural trees goodwin et al 2006 o connell et al 2008 goodwin et al 2015 al muaini et al 2018 the annual average kc values of the ghaf trees in 2017 were 0 110 and 0 129 for the gw and tse treatments respectively so the kc li 1 values are 0 39 and 0 42 much less than the 1 1 2 that has been reported for the sidr trees the kc values were 0 056 and 0 07 for the gw and tse treatments their kc li 1 values are therefore 0 62 and 0 37 which are again much less than those already reported we consider there are two reasons why these kc li 1 values are less than half of those reported by others firstly as noted above there was a significant contribution of the woody branches of these arid forest species in the measured li this woody infrastructure does not contribute to transpiration and is not reflected in the kc secondly both al ghaf and sidr are xerophytic halophytes and would have been under salt stress under our treatments we measured very low leaf conductances for al sidr which we considered to be typical of ziziphus trees at low water potentials 2 mpa and low osmotic potentials 2 mpa arndt et al 2001 thus the ratio kc li 1 is much lower for our arid forest trees than the well watered value of 1 1 2 for horticultural trees because of water stress resulting in a lower kc and because our li value was higher though the influence of non leaf interception of light by the woody parts of the trees nonetheless the consistent values of kc li 1 0 4 0 6 for these arid forest species does appear provide a simple basis for using the light stick measurements to infer the crop factor we are examining this further for another arid forest species al samr 3 6 irrigation requirements current practice at khub al dhas forest is to irrigate both the ghaf and sidr trees with 60 l d 1 of groundwater implementation of abu dhabi s law 5 requires that irrigation be allocated at the minimum amount required to achieve the desired goal in al yamani et al 2018 we provided an irrigation allocation schedule for gw to both the ghaf and sidr trees which suggested a monthly schedule of 1 5 etc and this was based on 25 factor of safety and a 25 salt leaching fraction our results here show that with tse the 25 requirement for a salt leaching fraction could be dispensed with so for tse the suggested schedule now becomes the 1 25 etc column in table 1 of al yamani et al 2018 that means that on an annual average basis the al ghaf trees only need 34 9 l d 1 of tse and the sidr trees only need 29 3 l d 1 furthermore if the desire were to use tse to achieve the same tree productivity as for the gw trees figs 9 and 10 then this rate of tse could be even reduced further because of the beneficial impact of the sweeter tse 4 conclusions the arid forests in the hyper arid deserts of abu dhabi require irrigating saline groundwater is the predominant source for the irrigation water and the current practice is to irrigate al ghaf and al sidr trees using 60 l of groundwater every day of the year in al yamani et al 2018 we proposed an allocation schedule for irrigation using saline gw which was based on 1 5 etc accounting for a 25 factor of safety and a 25 salt leaching fraction we now update these recommendations for tse these irrigated arid forests require considerably less water than current practices for both gw and tse the low salt content of the tse means that far less extra water is required when using tse instead of gw to achieve similar plant growth to that achieved with current irrigation these changes represent a 50 60 reduction in water application from current practices in addition using an alternative water source like tse will reduce the drawing down of the finite groundwater reserves and protect the remaining aquifer stocks of water 
11149,the arid forests of abu dhabi are valuable but they require irrigating currently groundwater gw is the source of this water but these subterranean reserves are being over exploited law no 5 of 2016 on the regulation of gw has been passed by the government of abu dhabi to reduce gw abstraction abu dhabi has a supply of tertiary treated sewage effluent tse that could be used as an alternative for irrigation we set up experiments near madinat zayed in the al dhafra region of abu dhabi on two arid forest species al ghaf prosopis cineraria and al sidr ziziphus spina christi the trees were planted at 8 m x 8 m spacing the tse is significantly sweeter than gw as its electrical conductivity is 1 ds m 1 whereas gw is 8 10 ds m 1 the gw in this region is very high in nitrates 38 4 9 2 mg no3 l 1 and this was not significantly different from the tse 53 7 11 8 mg no3 l 1 we monitored the actual tree water use etc l h 1 via heat pulse devices in both the gw and tse irrigated trees we quantified the differences in the etc patterns for both the gw and tse irrigated trees of both species over 3 years both species showed positive growth responses to tse relative to the gw and we consider this to be due to the lower electrical conductivity of the tse water because of this growth response the etc of the tse by the ghaf trees was on annual average 17 higher than gw and for the sidr it was 39 our results were corroborated by leaf conductance and leaf area inferences but for tse there is no need for a salt leaching fraction furthermore to achieve the same tree health outcome as with the gw even less tse need be applied irrigation requirements for tse were at least 25 less than for gw keywords saline groundwater treated sewage effluent arid forests irrigation environmental regulations crop factor 1 introduction abu dhabi s arid forests are located in a hyper arid desert where annual precipitation is less than 50 mm and annual potential evapotranspiration exceeds 2000 mm despite these harsh desert conditions the first president of the united arab emirates uae h h sheikh zayed al nahyan sought to establish many forests to realise the valuable ecosystem services delivered by the trees this greening of the desert began in the 1970s abu dhabi s forests now cover about 3 5 of the emirate the total number of trees is around 20 million trees and thanks to irrigation with groundwater gw some 80 of these forests are classified in good condition the annual gw consumption for irrigation of the current forests is estimated to be about one quarter of total gw extractions meanwhile conserving gw is imperative for food security cultural heritage and the environment of abu dhabi in november 2016 the general secretariat of the executive council of the abu dhabi government issued law no 5 officially declaring that the emirate of abu dhabi owns the gw reserves and that its extraction and use would be governed by the rules standards and conditions set out by environment agency abu dhabi ead law no 5 will help to manage the demand for gw and ensure reserves into the future ead 2017 in an earlier paper al yamani et al 2018 we described our experiments on the irrigation of al ghaf and al sidr by saline gw with an electrical conductivity ec of 8 10 ds m 1 from our results and analyses we provided ead with new gw irrigation allocations for law 5 based on direct measurements of tree water use etc plus a factor of safety of 25 and a salt leaching fraction of 25 al yamani et al 2018 adoption of this allocation regime will result in gw savings of up to 40 in forest irrigation 1 1 treated sewage effluent however even greater savings are required to protect gw reserves so the abu dhabi government has recently started new initiatives to understand better the status and the pressure on the more than 100 000 groundwater wells in the emirate this strategic assessment now involves seeking ways to reduce pressure on gw by finding alternative sources for irrigation the uae has been collecting and treating sewage since 1973 and this tertiary treated tse is derived from desalinated water across the hyper arid states of the gulf cooperation council gcc there is an emerging interest in using tse for irrigation in agriculture and for its use in watering amenity plantings al a ama and nakhla 1995 al zubari 1998 treated sewage effluent is sweeter than gw in the sense of salt the ec of tse is generally 1 ds m 1 some tenfold lower than gw the tse comes from residential and municipal sources trade water use plus some storm water runoff and rainfall there are more than 60 wastewater treatment plants in the uae and the majority of these are in abu dhabi most of these treatment plants use advanced technologies to treat the sewage water to a tertiary level currently some tse is used for irrigation of amenity vegetation but still a significant volume of tse is disposed of into the arabian gulf the government has a plan to achieve full usage of tse for irrigation 1 2 objectives the goal of the work outlined here was to provide ead with guidelines to aid in the implementation of law 5 in terms of irrigation requirements impacts on tree health and gw savings through the use of tse to irrigate two major species of arid forest al ghaf prosopis cineraria and al sidr ziziphus spina christi the research objective was to quantify the water use et c l d 1 or mm d 1 of al ghaf and al sidr trees irrigated with tse so that new allocation guidelines can be developed for law 5 for this alternative water source the et c of the tse irrigated trees is compared to that of those gw trees previously described in al yamani et al 2018 we also sought to determine what controls the differences in the et c between the gw and tse irrigated trees and to quantify the impact of tse on both tree performance and soil health in al yamani et al 2018 we provided irrigation allowances that would minimise the use of gw to irrigate the trees and here we sought to do the same for tse so that maximum benefit can be made of this valuable alternative source of water furthermore we describe the use of our light stick to infer the fractional light interception li of the gw and tse trees this li enables their crop factor k c to be estimated so that the fao 56 model allen et al 1998 can be used to predict the tree s etc simply from the reference evapotranspiration et o using k c et o 2 materials methods the major native species of the hyper arid forests of the abu dhabi desert are the ghaf sidr arak and samr here we discuss irrigation experiments on mature plots of al ghaf and al sidr trees both tree species in our experimental plots were irrigated either with gw or tse 2 1 research site this research was carried out within the khub al dahs forest 23 51 n 53 75 e near madinat zayed in the al dhafra region of the western desert of abu dhabi al yamani et al 2018 have provided a complete description of the site and the experimental set up so only salient details are repeated here the soil is a typic torripsamment mixed hyperthermic soil ad158 ead 2009 shahid et al 2014 it is a deep sandy soil that is widely distributed across 75 of the uae a large proportion of the managed forests in the uae are on this type of soil two experimental sites were established one site consisted of 12 al ghaf trees and the other 12 al sidr trees within each plot six trees in a single row were irrigated with gw and in the neighbouring row six trees were irrigated with tse the botanical details of the ghaf and sidr trees are provided in al yamani et al 2018 also as described in al yamani et al 2018 sapflow sensors were installed in four trees of each treatment to provide a continuous record of the trees transpiration et c l d 1 using the compensation heat pulse velocity method green et al 2003 the sapflow devices were installed in the ghaf trees in december 2014 and during february 2015 for the sidr trees the tse treatments on both tree species began on 18 may 2015 automated irrigation systems were used at both experimental sites to control the irrigation using gw and tse two tanks each of 22 730 litres were located at both the ghaf and sidr sites one tank at both sites was continuously filled with gw having a salinity of 8 10 ds m 1 the other tank at both sites were filled every month with tse provided by the abu dhabi sewerage services company the source of the tse was domestic tse from the city of madinat zayed which has a population of 30 000 the ec of the tse water was always much less than 1 ds m 1 the water from both of these large header tanks was then transferred separately to smaller tanks each of 2273 litres to help with the mixing of the water to reduce salinity variations each system was operated daily for 6 h beginning early in the morning flow meters were used to monitor the applied aliquots of water pressure compensated drippers were used with two 4 l h 1 drippers per tree thus each tree received about 60 l d 1 on each day throughout the year the irrigation strategy was however changed in the last year of the experiment 2017 as we discuss later 2 2 weather monitoring khub al

the hourly and daily values of the reference evaporation et o mm hr 1 or mm d 1 using the fao 56 approach of allen et al 1998 the transpiration rate of the trees et c mm hr 1 or mm d 1 as measured by the sapflow sensors was then related to et o via the crop factor k c using 1 et c k c et o 2 3 soil water and leaf analyses samples of the irrigation water soil and the leaves were collected from both the gw and tse trees at appropriate times chemical and microbiological analyses on the soil and water sampled were carried out by the commercial company exova ltd in dubai www exova com leaf samples were analysed by united arab emirates university in al ain 2 3 1 gw and tse water analyses there are more than 40 wells in khub al dahs forest the gw in al ghaf experimental site is pumped from a different well than the one in al sidr experimental site water samples were collected directly from dripper outlets while the irrigation was on two water samples were collected from both the gw and tse lines at the al ghaf and al sidr sites in 2015 at the initiation of the tse application and a second sampling was done at the end of 2017 2 3 2 soil analyses the first soil samples labelled as the reference were taken in february 2015 these were taken inside the same forest and close to but just outside of the experimental plots we collected a total of six soil samples three of them were taken directly under the dripper at depths of 10 20 and 40 cm and the other three samples were taken on the edge of the wet zone around the dripper soil samples were collected three more times during the experiments in december 2015 december 2016 and finally in december 2017 these soil samples were also collected from directly under the dripper and at the edge of the wetted zone they were taken from around two guard trees located at the respective ends of the experimental rows so as to avoid disturbing the soil around the experimental trees the guard trees were under the same irrigation regime as the experimental trees 2 3 2 1 chemical analyses after examining the results of the soil chemistry obtained between the guard trees and between the edge of the drip zone and directly under it we decided to group the results as there were no differences between these groupings 2 3 2 2 microbiological analyses laboratory analyses were carried out on these soil samples for enterococci cfu 100 m l 1 faecal coliforms cfu 100 m l 1 and helminth eggs eggs l 1 to assess the risks of the use of tse on human health 2 3 3 leaf analyses leaf samples from al ghaf and al sidr were collected from the experimental trees we took a random selection of leaves about 10 20 from each tree from around each quadrant of each tree leaf sampling was done at four times in 2015 2016 2017 during the period of april june and the final group of samples were taken on december 2017 2 4 leaf conductance a diurnal sequence of leaf conductance g c mmol m 2 s 1 was carried out of the sidr trees on the 26 september 2017 as this was the time at which trees leaf area was near its maximum the measurements were made from mid morning through to mid afternoon using a steady state porometer li 1600 li cor inc lincoln nebraska 68504 5000 usa to measure the g c because of the small and pinnate nature of the leaves of al ghaf it was not possible to measure the g c of those leaves the coriaceous sidr leaves are hypostomatous with the stomata present only on the lower surface of the leaves 2 5 the light stick given the lower ec we anticipated that the tse would most likely have a beneficial impact on tree growth and tree health our measurements of tree water use et c would we hypothesised reflect this change in tree performance however we also sought a simpler means of inferring this response and one that would have greater utility by measuring the tree canopy characteristics that might be affected by tse this would also extend to assess the impact of gws of different salinities lang 1987 developed a method of using the transmittance of the sun s beam through a tree s canopy to infer the canopy leaf area canopy radiation interception can be estimated from static or mobile arrays of quantum sensors using beer s law extending the method of lang and mcmurtrie 1992 we have developed a small hand held light stick that can be used in an understory transit to record the percentage of light being transmitted through the canopy the light intercepted fraction li from these light stick measurements provides a measure of the canopy size and leaf area density the small light stick tranzflo nz ltd palmerston north nz is 200 mm long with 4 equi spaced quantum sensors that are sensitive to photosynthetically active radiation par the light stick was held horizontally just above the sand surface and then in a sweeping motion the interior of each of the tree s shadow area was traversed completely so that the light transmittance could be determined the length and breadth of the perimeter of each tree s shadow area were measured at the same time from time of day the zenith and azimuth angles of the sun are known and it is then possible to compute the effective tree shadow area lang and mcmurtrie 1992 from the light stick s measure of transmittance and given the tree spacing we thus can infer the li fraction by the leaves and woody structures that have intercepted the incoming radiation both the tse and gw trees were measured for both species and this was carried out april may september and december these dates would enable us to capture the changing leaf areas of the trees at the beginning of leaf fall the maximum defoliation and the maximum leaf area respectively the light stick was used here to determine the impact of tse on the changed growth habit of the ghaf and sidr trees that had previously been irrigated with gw also the li is linked here to the crop factor kc we inferred directly from the sap flow measurements 3 results and discussion 3 1 water soil and leaf results 3 1 1 water the main differences between gw and tse waters lay in their salt chemistries the electrical conductivity of the tse was less than 10 of that of the gw the anion and cation chemistries reflected the high content of salts in the gw table 1 interestingly especially from the perspective of plant growth there is no significant difference between the nitrate contents in the gw and tse both were very high and well in excess of health guidelines for potable water fragaszy and mcdonnell 2016 reported that high levels of nitrate occur naturally in the groundwater around liwa due to the low rates of plant uptake high leaching and the accumulation of precipitation derived evaporites 3 1 2 soil 3 1 2 1 chemistry the key results for the salt chemistry found on saturated paste extracts are given in table 2 the salinity and the sodicity sodium adsorption ratio sar values for soil samples taken under al ghaf and al sidr trees are higher in the soil irrigated with gw than in the soil irrigated with tse this is to be expected because of the different salt chemistries of the two irrigation sources table 1 an interesting finding from the soil salinity values is that there is no build up of salinity in the soil around the drippers this confirms the in situ findings using ec probes we described in al yamani et al 2018 the salt leaching fraction of 25 with a factor of safety of 25 appeared effective at leaching the salts from the dripzones of the gw irrigated trees in addition to this salt chemistry we determined the total nitrogen content of the soil wetted by the respective irrigation waters table 3 there were no differences in soil nitrogen content between the gw irrigated soil and the tse irrigated soil and this was the same for both the al ghaf and al sidr trees the high amounts of soil nitrogen reflect the high concentrations of nitrate in both the gw and the tse waters and the similarity in the nitrate concentration between these two irrigation sources thus it is not possible to attribute any differences in plant growth and performance to nitrogen nutrition we also carried out analyses of the soil concentrations of heavy metals and metalloids table 4 the results were equivocal the only differences between the gw and tse soil concentrations for the ghaf were for zinc chromium and fluoride and all were highly statistically significant the only differences between the soils at the sidr site were for chromium low significance and fluoride medium significance in all cases the gw irrigated soil that had the higher concentrations 3 1 2 2 soil microbiology no helminth eggs were found in the wetted soil of either treatment enterococci and faecal coliforms were found in virtually all samples from both treatments there were no significant differences between the concentrations of either the enterococci and faecal coliforms between the gw and tse treatments thus it would seem that the enterococci and faecal coliforms are naturally occurring and not derived from human sources via just the tse this forest is home to herds of desert gazelles and there is abundant bird life these would seem to be the origin of these microbes however both plots had been fenced off for three years so it would seem that the communities of these microbes are now living autonomously in the soil as has been found elsewhere byappanahalli and fujioka 1998 hartz et al 2008 reported on the survival potential of enterococci and faecal coliforms in sub tropical beach sand from our results it now seems that they can also survive in the drip zones of irrigated desert sands the use tse for irrigation of amenity forests would therefore seem not to pose a risk to human health 3 1 3 leaf the bulked results in relation to the leaf macro nutrients are given in table 5 there were no significant differences in p and k values between the irrigation treatments for both al ghaf and al sidr there was a difference of low statistical significance between the leaf n concentrations in al sidr trees but it was the gw irrigated trees that had the higher n amounts thus we conclude that any differences that we observed between the tse and gw irrigated trees were not due to the amounts of nutrients in the tse irrigated trees 3 2 al ghaf transpiration gw and tse sap flow data for the four gw irrigated ghaf trees began on 12 december 2014 and continued over three years through until early 2018 fig 1 the daily measured tree water use values etc l d 1 are presented along with the daily values of the reference evapotranspiration eto mm d 1 the first two years of these data were presented by al yamani et al 2018 and we present the extended three year data set here for completeness to enable comparison with the tse values fig 2 the tse treatment began on 18th may 2015 over the last 7 months of 2015 despite the tse being applied to the treatment trees there was no difference in their etc relative to that of the gw trees both the gw and tse patterns of etc tracked eto however during the early months of 2016 the tse trees etc increased relative to previous tracking with eto and became relatively greater than the etc of the gw trees this divergence became clearer when we calculated and compared the crop factors kc for the gw and tse trees in fig 3 is shown the annual variation in the kc of the gw trees and this data set comprises over 3 years of daily measurements which is one more year than the equivalent data set previously presented by al yamani et al 2018 there was a muted seasonal pattern due to the asynchrony of the deciduous behaviours of the various trees peak leaf area occurred in december january and there was leaf fall in february over the 3 years the annual average kc for the gw trees was 0 110 0 03 n 1127 the annual seasonal patterns in the kc values for the tse trees are shown in fig 4 for the calendar years of 2015 2016 and 2017 unlike for the gw trees fig 3 there was a separation in behaviours between years for the tse trees fig 4 the annual average kc for 2015 for the tse trees was 0 112 0 03 n 309 which was no different from that of the gw trees however in the year after beginning tse irrigation there was greater vegetative vigour and less defoliation especially during january may 2016 the 2016 annual average kc was 0 127 0 027 n 310 which was significantly p 0 001 higher than the 2015 average value for 2017 the annual average kc was 0 129 0 035 n 358 which was not significantly different from the 2016 value thus our sap flow measurements have revealed that tse increased the trees leaf growth such that the kc of the tse trees became 17 higher than that of the gw trees we were not able to discern any visual differences between the treatment trees and this difference was made detectable only through our sap flow measurements 3 3 al sidr transpiration gw and tse our measured etc for each of the four multi stemmed sidr trees was computed using our baseline measurements of sapflow in the four monitored trees of each treatment before we began to analyse the impact of tse on the water use of the sidr trees we re visited the crop factor results of al yamani et al 2018 for the gw irrigated trees al yamani et al 2018 presented the 2015 and 2016 kc data as one here we have split the two years to show the difference in the vegetative vigour between the years fig 5 it can be seen that january to april 2015 was an on fruiting year with low vegetative vigour whereas 2016 was an off fruiting year with high vegetative vigour the fruit when they drop to the ground provide food for the desert gazelles the on off year behaviour in 2015 and 2016 affected the comparison we wished to make with the tse trees immediately upon commencement of the treatment in figs 6 and 7 we present the actual average tree water uses etc l d 1 of the gw and tse sidr trees also shown in these figures are the actual daily amounts of irrigation applied to each of the trees noting that a zero value does not always mean no irrigation because sometimes there was a flowmeter malfunction by comparison of figs 6 and 7 it can be seen that in early 2015 the etc of the tse trees was already greater than that of the gw trees before the tse treatment was commenced on 18th may this difference was due to the lower vegetative vigour of the gw trees in the off fruiting year of 2015 fig 5 during 2016 we provided ead with advice that considered the sustainable irrigation of arid forest trees would be at the rate of 1 5 etc allowing for a factor of safety of 25 and a salt leaching fraction of 25 we decided to test this schedule experimentally on the sidr trees in 2017 figs 6 and 7 shows the reduced rates of irrigation with a summer peak rate of irrigation dropping to about 45 l d 1 thus the 2017 data provide us with a good comparison of the impact of tse on al sidr tree water use over the year from 1 march 2017 to 1 march 2018 we applied an average of 30 l d 1 of irrigation to the gw trees and 33 l d 1 to the tse trees so within our ability to manage the irrigation we essentially applied the same amount of water to both treatments of around 30 l d 1 being half of what is current practice of 60 l d 1 over that year the gw trees transpired on annual average 14 4 3 0 l d 1 whereas the tse trees transpired on average 20 0 7 2 l d 1 a rate that was 39 higher therefore tse irrigation could be even further reduced below 30 l d 1 to achieve a similar tree health outcome as the gw trees in fig 8 we show the seasonal trend in the respective crop factors over 2017 18 for the gw and tse irrigated trees as expected the kc for the tse trees was always higher than that of the gw trees furthermore the deciduous loss of leaves in early april was not as severe for the tse trees and the re emergent leaf growth occurs sooner and more vigorously in may under this reduced irrigation regime the annual average kc for the gw trees was 0 056 whereas it was 0 070 for the tse trees in fig 9 we show the comparison between two trees and their maximum deciduous defoliation tree 5 left is a gw irrigated tree and tree 8 right is tse irrigated there were more viable and greener leaves on the tse tree at this time in fig 10 we show these same two trees at a time when they were approaching their maximum leaf area in late september the greater leaf area of the tse tree is obvious and we draw attention to the differing sizes and light densities of the respective tree shadows 3 4 leaf conductance gc during mid morning to mid afternoon on the 25 september 2017 we carried out measurements of g c on the gw and tse sidr trees for the tse trees we found the average g c to be 17 7 mmol m 2 s 1 se 2 2 n 19 and that for the gw trees was 8 1 mmol m 2 s 1 se 1 5 n 17 the difference was significant p 0 05 the gw trees had a lower g c presumably as a result of their lower and more negative osmotic water potential resulting from the irrigation with more saline groundwater this difference in g c would explain the different tree productivities figs 9 and 10 both these conductance values are very low as befits a xerophytic halophyte like al sidr ziziphus growing under conditions of high temperatures combined with very low atmospheric humidity the relative humidity was around 10 at noon and the air temperatures were 45c arndt et al 2011 reported low g c values for ziziphus rotundafolia growing under controlled conditions in pots for their severe water stress treatment water was withheld and the leaf water potential dropped to 2 mpa after 20 days at which time the osmotic potential was 2 3 mpa between 15 and 28 days they measured the leaf conductance of these stressed ziziphus trees to be between 5 15 mmol m 2 s 1 although our leaf conductance measurements were carried out only over a single day they do indicate that the gw trees were under greater water stress than the tse trees that were irrigated with lower salinity water this difference in stomatal conductance would seem to account for the greater productivity of the tse trees 3 5 light stick and the crop factor the li results are presented in table 6 for the gw irrigated ghaf trees the li was at its lowest of 0 26 0 28 during leaf fall in april may and rose to 0 30 in december at the time of maximum leafiness there was also a seasonal change in the tse irrigated ghaf trees albeit somewhat muted the tse trees had a significantly greater p 0 05 li than the gw trees by 11 a similar seasonal pattern in li was found the sidr trees for both treatments table 6 the li for the tse trees was twice that of the gw trees and this difference was significant p 0 0001 the light stick clearly picked up the leaf growth responses to tse by both species through measuring li however the seasonal changes in li were less than anticipated from our visual observations of the changing leafiness figs 9 and 10 this is due to the characteristic canopy architecture of both species the leaves of al ghaf and al sidr figs 9 and 10 are small and numerous on the many structural branches of the trees so even during leaf fall there was a substantial degree of light interception by the woody branches of the tree fig 9 left this woodiness explains the muted seasonal response in the measured li despite the changing leaf area studies have linked the easily measured value of li to the crop factor kc in order to predict tree water use etc using the inferred kc in the formula etc kc eto the ratio kc li 1 has been found to be in the range of 1 1 2 for well watered horticultural trees goodwin et al 2006 o connell et al 2008 goodwin et al 2015 al muaini et al 2018 the annual average kc values of the ghaf trees in 2017 were 0 110 and 0 129 for the gw and tse treatments respectively so the kc li 1 values are 0 39 and 0 42 much less than the 1 1 2 that has been reported for the sidr trees the kc values were 0 056 and 0 07 for the gw and tse treatments their kc li 1 values are therefore 0 62 and 0 37 which are again much less than those already reported we consider there are two reasons why these kc li 1 values are less than half of those reported by others firstly as noted above there was a significant contribution of the woody branches of these arid forest species in the measured li this woody infrastructure does not contribute to transpiration and is not reflected in the kc secondly both al ghaf and sidr are xerophytic halophytes and would have been under salt stress under our treatments we measured very low leaf conductances for al sidr which we considered to be typical of ziziphus trees at low water potentials 2 mpa and low osmotic potentials 2 mpa arndt et al 2001 thus the ratio kc li 1 is much lower for our arid forest trees than the well watered value of 1 1 2 for horticultural trees because of water stress resulting in a lower kc and because our li value was higher though the influence of non leaf interception of light by the woody parts of the trees nonetheless the consistent values of kc li 1 0 4 0 6 for these arid forest species does appear provide a simple basis for using the light stick measurements to infer the crop factor we are examining this further for another arid forest species al samr 3 6 irrigation requirements current practice at khub al dhas forest is to irrigate both the ghaf and sidr trees with 60 l d 1 of groundwater implementation of abu dhabi s law 5 requires that irrigation be allocated at the minimum amount required to achieve the desired goal in al yamani et al 2018 we provided an irrigation allocation schedule for gw to both the ghaf and sidr trees which suggested a monthly schedule of 1 5 etc and this was based on 25 factor of safety and a 25 salt leaching fraction our results here show that with tse the 25 requirement for a salt leaching fraction could be dispensed with so for tse the suggested schedule now becomes the 1 25 etc column in table 1 of al yamani et al 2018 that means that on an annual average basis the al ghaf trees only need 34 9 l d 1 of tse and the sidr trees only need 29 3 l d 1 furthermore if the desire were to use tse to achieve the same tree productivity as for the gw trees figs 9 and 10 then this rate of tse could be even reduced further because of the beneficial impact of the sweeter tse 4 conclusions the arid forests in the hyper arid deserts of abu dhabi require irrigating saline groundwater is the predominant source for the irrigation water and the current practice is to irrigate al ghaf and al sidr trees using 60 l of groundwater every day of the year in al yamani et al 2018 we proposed an allocation schedule for irrigation using saline gw which was based on 1 5 etc accounting for a 25 factor of safety and a 25 salt leaching fraction we now update these recommendations for tse these irrigated arid forests require considerably less water than current practices for both gw and tse the low salt content of the tse means that far less extra water is required when using tse instead of gw to achieve similar plant growth to that achieved with current irrigation these changes represent a 50 60 reduction in water application from current practices in addition using an alternative water source like tse will reduce the drawing down of the finite groundwater reserves and protect the remaining aquifer stocks of water
