6280,hydrological modelling is a challenging and significant issue especially in nonhomogeneous catchments in terms of geology and it is an essential part of water resources management in this study daily rainfall runoff modelling was carried out using the lumped conceptual model the artificial neural network ann the deep neural network dnn and regression tree rt data mining models for the nonhomogeneous karst ljubljanica catchment and four of its sub catchments in slovenia with different geological characteristics model performance was evaluated using several performance criteria and additional investigation of low and high flows was carried out the results of the study indicate that the génie rural à 4 paramètres journalier gr4j lumped conceptual model yielded better modelling performance compared to the data driven models namely ann dnn and rt models moreover the enhanced version of the gr4j model i e gr6j also yielded good performance in terms of the recession part the rt model yielded the worst performance regarding runoff forecasting among the examined models in the case of all five investigated catchments however ann and dnn data driven models were slightly more successful in modelling the hydrograph recession in the case of karst sub catchments compared to the gr4j lumped conceptual model structure inclusion of additional meteorological variables to ann and dnn does not significantly improve modelling results keywords hydrological model lumped conceptual model data mining karst nonhomogeneous catchment ljubljanica river 1 introduction hydrological modelling is very important for water resources management development and planning moreover hydrological modelling is a crucial component of predicting the hydrological variables needed for the design of water structures and other measures used for flood prevention as well as for the prediction and management of droughts e g bonacci and ljubenkov 2008 nayak et al 2013 bezak et al 2018a 2018b various methods can be used for hydrological modelling such as empirical models conceptual models data mining techniques e g de vos and rientjes 2007 salerno and tartari 2009 makwana and tiwari 2017 the main advantage of conceptual models compared to empirical and data driven models is that hydrological processes that occur within a catchment are described conceptually with the model structure however in the case of complex catchments such as karst areas which are highly non linear and hierarchical systems this kind of representation may not be adequate to improve modelling results since large ice free continental areas are underlain by karst e g 35 of europe and they are in many places around the world crucial for drinking water supply ford and williams 2007 hartmann et al 2014 additional evaluation of different hydrological models in such areas is even more important goyal et al 2017 in the case of karst areas data mining models could be regarded as an interesting alternative to the conceptual models since due to the non homogeneous geological structure preferential underground flow paths sinks ponors and springs that can be found in karst areas these features are often hard to describe with the conceptual model structure thus investigations into applications of the data mining methods for hydrological modelling in the case of regions where the knowledge about hydrological processes is rather limited i e karst catchments could lead to the development of enhanced models that would yield better modelling results many researchers have compared various data mining techniques with other methods for hydrological modelling of flows in non karstic catchments e g demirel et al 2009 nayak et al 2013 sahay and srivastava 2014 bai et al 2016 humphrey et al 2016 for example nayak et al 2013 analyzed the performance of two data mining based models namely the wavelet based neural network model wnn the artificial neural network ann and the conceptual nedbør afstrømnings model for rainfall runoff modelling in the malaprabha catchment in india they demonstrated that the wnn model performed better in estimating runoff than the other two models the modelling result presented by nayak et al 2013 also demonstrated that data driven models could be a useful tool for predicting runoff when the underlying physical relationships are not fully known or there are not enough data to apply a numerical model furthermore humphrey et al 2016 investigated the performance of a hybrid model using the simulated soil moisture output of the génie rural à 4 paramètres journalier gr4j conceptual model as input data to the data mining based ann model in three catchments in south australia where baseflow represents a significant proportion of the streamflow they demonstrated that the hybrid model yielded better performance than both individual models because of its ability to easily include groundwater data as well as initial soil moisture conditions in the model however the greatest weakness of the hybrid approach is that it requires a lot of time and expertise of the modeller demirel et al 2009 applied the data driven ann model and the process based soil water assessment tool swat model for daily streamflow forecasting in the pracana catchment in portugal they stated that the ann model outperformed the swat model especially in the estimation of peak flows they argued that the peak flow simulation inefficiency of the conceptual model could be caused by the formulation of processes used in the swat model and that the lag time of one day may be the reason of not capturing phenomena of high frequency occurrences studies applying different hydrological models in karst areas have already been conducted for example liu et al 2005 modified an existing physically based and distributed hydrological model named water and energy transfer between soil plants and atmosphere wetspa and applied it to estimating flows in a karst catchment that is located in north western vietnam in order to simulate the karst aquifer more effectively the results demonstrated that the modified model is able to simulate reasonably well the generation of stormflows however the model does not allow for determining the internal structure and spatial disposition of contributions in the aquifer furthermore rimmer and salingar 2006 developed the hydrological model for karst environment hymke which they described as a gray box model for daily rainfall streamflow modelling in karst areas they tried to include attributes describing preferential flow that recharges the groundwater and therewith solves the problem of uncorrelated baseflow and surface flow in karst areas the model was applied to the major tributaries of the upper catchment of the jordan river in israel they stated that the hymke model exhibits good performance for modelling streamflow in this case study in recent years different data driven models were utilized in order to improve the modelling results in karst areas kurtulus and razack 2007 utilized a neural network model in order to forecast the discharge of a karst aquifer in southwest france they indicated high applicability of the data driven ann model for the rainfall runoff relationship modelling in karst areas although the ann approach captures well the most important features of the karst system dynamics authors noted that the model s limitations regarding modelling of high flows warrant further research a few years later the same authors kurtulus and razack 2010 compared the aforementioned ann model with the adaptive neuro fuzzy interface system anfis model at the same karst area in south west france as a result they found out that the anfis model yields slightly better modelling performance than the ann model with respect to the estimation of peak flows furthermore goyal et al 2017 applied different support vector regression based svr models for the prediction of discharge in two karst springs in greece and they demonstrated that the svr model could be relatively successfully applied for hydrological modelling in karst areas they argued that the results are comparable to those of ann the above literature review demonstrates that various models have been applied to simulate flows in different karst areas around the world but with different success rates furthermore studies comparing process based and data driven model performance in nonhomogeneous karst areas are rare since most of the studies deal with one model or alternatively more models of the same type additionally most of the studies are focused particularly on simulation performance of average and high flows and not so much on low flows which is the case in our study where we will focus on a different aspect of the hydrological regime the main scientific question that is investigated in this study is if data mining models provide a valuable alternative to the selected lumped conceptual hydrological model in terms of model efficiency when investigating karst catchments in order to answer the main scientific question we carried out daily rainfall runoff modelling using a lumped conceptual model génie rural à 4 paramètres journalier gr4j and three different data mining models namely the artificial neural network ann the deep neural network dnn and the regression tree rt model for simulating flows in the nonhomogeneous karst ljubljanica catchment around 1800 km2 in slovenia europe and its four selected small sub catchments about 50 km2 with different geological characteristics the main aim of this study is to compare and evaluate the performance of all aforementioned models that were applied to all five catchments having predominantly karst or non karst characteristics with a special emphasis on low and high flows moreover the influence of the substitution of the evapotranspiration input variable with meteorological variables e g air temperature saturation vapour pressure deficit in the data mining model structures on the modelling performance was investigated the main idea behind the selection of sub catchments with different characteristics was to evaluate the impact of karst characteristics on the model s performance which can be regarded as a novelty of this paper 2 data and methods 2 1 the ljubljanica river catchment the ljubljanica river catchment was selected as a case study in this study due to its nonhomogeneous characteristics mostly in terms of geology and karst features the ljubljanica river drains into the sava river and is part of the danube river basin the catchment area up to the moste gauging station is 1778 km2 fig 1 and table 1 kovačič and ravbar 2016 provided a detailed description of the complex ljubljanica river system and its main karst characteristics here we provide only a short overview of the complex karst system the dominant land use types in the ljubljanica river catchment are forest and semi natural areas most of the ljubjanica river catchment has temperate continental characteristics maximum rainfall amounts are measured around high mountain peaks such as the javorniki karst plateau where the annual rainfall exceeds 2000 mm however the lower part of the catchment usually receives around 1400 mm of rain per year most of the ljubljanica river catchment lies in dinaric karst and some smaller parts of the catchments can also be defined as pre alpine karst fig 1 most of the ljubljanica river catchment is composed of porous carbonate rocks where limestone and dolomite are dominant and only a small part northern lower part consists of non carbonate rocks several sinking rivers e g stržen pivka malenščica unica are located in this catchment which in combination with the river recharge from the high karst plateaus e g javorniki snežnik yields a complex hydrological behaviour kovačič and ravbar 2016 the exact catchment area for these rivers e g stržen pivka malenščica unica cannot be precisely determined in order to investigate these nonhomogeneous characteristics and hydrological behaviour of the ljubljanica river catchment we selected its four smaller sub catchments that have discharge data available from 2000 until 2016 table 1 we focused on catchments that have well defined catchment boundaries with the purpose of fitting different models to the data e g the catchment area is needed to convert m3 s to mm which is used as an input to the conceptual model firstly we selected two predominantly karst sub catchments namely the cerkniščica river cerknica discharge gauging station which is located in dinaric karst and the nanoščica river mali otok discharge gauging station whose catchment area has an impermeable surface with significant underground flow through the karst edge i e boundary between karst and istria fig 1 the cerkniščica is the largest surface river that drains into lake cerknica most of the river network that drains into lake cerknica is flowing underground and has karst characteristics šušteršič and šušteršič 2003 kovačič and ravbar 2016 the nanoščica river is part of the pivka river catchment and these two rivers flow underground into the world famous postojna cave several springs of the nanoščica river are recharged from the nanos karst plateau we also selected two smaller catchments namely the gradaščica dvor discharge gauging station and the šujica razori discharge gauging station that are located in pre alpine karst and where catchment features are mainly dolomite and incomplete karst fig 1 both rivers flow into the ljubljanica river in the ljubljana city centre a few kilometres before the moste gauging station due to the topographic characteristics of the headwater part of this area i e steep slopes flash floods frequently occur in the gradaščica and šujica catchments e g bezak et al 2013 šraj et al 2016 bezak et al 2017 kovačec and šraj 2017 thus the whole catchment of the ljubljanica river up to the moste gauging station combines several nonhomogeneous characteristics related to geology and karst features which means that the hydrological characteristics of the hydrographs measured at this location are complex this means that compared to the rivers that have a similar catchment area and do not have significant karst features the hydrographs at the moste station have a longer rising limb and a significantly longer recession part e g bezak et al 2015 the reason is in several sinks and springs that have limited hydraulic capacity which means that runoff water that exceeds a specific threshold is retained in the upper part of the ljubljanica catchment several karst poljes are located in this area such as lake cerknica or planina polje this kind of hydrological behaviour provides natural retention areas that reduce the flood risk at the location of the moste gauging station compared to the ljubljanica river catchment all of its four selected smaller sub catchments are characterised by a faster catchment response especially by the gradaščica and šujica rivers since they do not have similar karst features table 1 also provides information about the relationship between summer i e july september and winter i e january march mean runoff and rainfall expressed with coefficient rcs w as defined by van esse et al 2013 based on the calculated coefficients all five selected case studies can be regarded as groundwater dominated catchments rcs w 0 24 of which the nanoščica catchment is the closest to the mixed regime 0 15 rcs w 0 24 which demonstrates that direct runoff contribution of the nanoščica catchment is higher than that for the other four investigated catchments fig 2 shows flow duration curves for the period from 2000 until 2016 for all five considered catchments curves demonstrate that the nanoščica and cerkniščica rivers have lower low flows i e flow that is not exceeded more than 50 of time compared to the gradaščica and šujica rivers based on the flow duration curves characteristics one could assume that the nanoščica and cerkniščica rivers have different storage characteristics than the gradaščica and šujica rivers despite similar catchment area size climate and land use characteristics moreover these differences could be related to the catchments different geology structure thus due to the differences in low flow characteristics and different geological properties we can assume that four considered sub catchments are not completely homogeneous this is important from the hydrological modelling perspective since we will investigate if different model types are able to provide similar performance despite the differences in the hydrological behaviour of the selected catchments 2 2 data daily data i e discharge rainfall and evapotranspiration from 2000 to 2016 were used in this study data are separated into two parts data from 2000 to 2010 were used for calibration and data from 2011 to 2016 for validation it can be assumed that the calibration and validation periods have similar climate characteristics table 2 shows selected discharge q rainfall p and evapotranspiration e measuring stations that were used in the study for each considered catchment in this study we applied reference evapotranspiration data calculated using the penman monteith equation for the selected meteorological stations a detailed description of the reference evapotranspiration data in slovenia can be found in maček et al 2018 a comparison between potential evapotranspiration calculated using oudin et al 2005 and reference evapotranspiration calculated using penman monteith method revealed a high correlation between these two variables selected rainfall and meteorological stations as well as thiessen polygons that were applied to calculate areal rainfall for the ljubljanica river up to the moste discharge gauging station are shown in fig 3 for the ljubljanica river catchment evapotranspiration was calculated as an average of postojna and ljubljana meteorological stations whereas the postojna meteorological station was the reference station for the cerkniščica and nanoščica catchments and the ljubljana meteorological station for the gradaščica and šujica catchments table 2 for some rainfall stations there were some missing rainfall data which were estimated using linear regression between the rainfall data of the considered station and the nearest station with data available for the missing period in order to determine the most suitable station the correlation between the rainfall data of neighbouring stations were taken into consideration as well as similarity of the stations elevation we also used daily air temperature t daily wind speed ws daily relative humidity rh daily sun duration sd and saturation vapour pressure deficit vpd as inputs to the ann and dnn models these data are only available for the postojna and ljubljana meteorological stations more information about the relationship among the aforementioned variables of the considered stations can be found in maček et al 2018 2 3 hydrological models 2 3 1 lumped gr4j hydrological model the gr4j model was developed based on the three parameter version of the génie rural journalier grj model with the aim to improve the low flow simulations perrin et al 2003 the idea behind the model development was to obtain the model structure as simple as possible and not to introduce more parameters than needed in order to obtain good modelling results e g perrin et al 2003 the gr4j lumped conceptual model uses daily p and e as input data for daily runoff modelling the gr4j model has four parameters i e x1 x2 x3 and x4 where x1 represents the maximum capacity of the production store in mm x2 the groundwater exchange coefficient x3 the one day ahead maximum capacity of the routing store in mm and x4 the unit hydrograph time base based on rainfall p and evapotranspiration e data the model calculates net rainfall pn which is then used to fill the production store ps and for runoff routing pn ps production store is emptied by percolation perc f s x1 where s is the production store level or by the actual evaporation rate es f s x1 en where en is net evapotranspiration the difference between net rainfall and rainfall that is used to fill the production store pn ps is then used together with percolation from the production store perc to calculate flow pr several routing steps are then applied to obtain the modelled flow values pr is divided into two parts 90 is being routed by the unit hydrograph hu1 x4 parameter and a routing store i e x3 parameter while 10 is routed by the unit hydrograph hu2 x4 parameter in the case of the hu2 and the routing store a groundwater exchange term gain or loss is also introduced x2 parameter moreover the first model parameter i e x1 defines the production store size and the other three parameters are related to the routing calculations for further details about the lumped conceptual gr4j daily rainfall runoff model and detailed equations that are used in the scope of the model one should refer to perrin et al 2003 model calibration was performed using the method proposed by michel 1991 where the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nash and sutcliffe 1970 was selected as the error criterion function the selected calibration algorithm combines global and local approaches for parameter estimation michel 1991 coron et al 2017 coron et al 2018 in this study gr4j model calibration and runoff simulation was done using airgr package coron et al 2017 coron et al 2018 which can be used in the r software r development core team 2015 additionally for the nanoščica river catchment the performance of the génie rural à 6 paramètres journalier gr6j model was tested that in comparison with the gr4j model uses two additional parameters and enhanced model structure i e additional routing store which is able to better predict low flows pushpalatha et al 2011 this model structure was proposed based on testing several different model structures using the downward modelling perspective pushpalatha et al 2011 2 3 2 data mining models 2 3 2 1 artificial neural network ann model the feed forward artificial neural network ann was also applied for rainfall runoff modelling in this study the ann structure is defined with several nodes that can be regarded as the processing elements and are often named neurons e g kurtulus and razack 2007 each neuron is connected to other neurons and the neuron task is to process the input signal and transform it to the output signal e g kurtulus and razack 2007 the ann structure used in this study is composed from an input layer multiple hidden layers and an output layer where a layer presents a group of neurons that have the same patterns of connections e g kurtulus and razack 2007 moreover connections among different layers have weights wkj that are activated during simulation and training li et al 2016 table 3 shows different input combinations that were tested to obtain the maximum performance of the ann model we tested two different cases in the first case the same input variables as those used in the gr4j model were applied and in the second case additional variables were included in the model as an example the structure of the 6 7 1 ann model is shown in fig 4 the model structure for the ann model was selected based on the trial and error principle for the training of the ann model the levenberg marquardt back propagation algorithm was used in this study various studies presented the advantages of utilization of the levenberg marquardt back propagation algorithm for the training of the ann model e g aqil et al 2007a badrzadeh et al 2013 tongal and booij 2018 furthermore the levenberg marquardt back propagation algorithm is very useful regarding its fast convergence ability robustness and simple usage demuth and beale 1998 aqil et al 2007b in addition since the tangent sigmoid function presents a fast process for the training of the dataset and secures more accurate forecasting results compared to the sigmoid function it was preferred in this study maier et al 1998 zadeh et al 2010 to obtain additional information about the ann model one can refer to the matlab neural network toolbox user s guide 2018 2 3 2 2 deep neural network dnn model the dnn model can be regarded as an improvement over the ann model since the back propagation algorithm used for the training of the ann model has some disadvantages e g convergence to the local minimum that have been reported in the literature for description see li et al 2016 and references cited therein and the dnn method improves these disadvantages similarly to ann dnn has three elements input hidden and output layer encoder function and decoder function weights and bias values between neighbouring layers are applied in the dnn model one of the differences between two methods is also in the number of layers which means that dnn has more hidden layers than ann the stacked auto encoder sae model was used as part of the hidden layer in order to improve the model performance compared to ann the output of the previous layer of the auto encoder will become the input of the next layer of the auto encoder the encoder converts the input into a hidden representation and then the decoder maps the hidden layer back to reconstruct the input e g li et al 2016 thus the purpose of the sae is to build a network the optimal parameters are obtained through optimization of the loss function e g li et al 2016 the steps of the sae modelling for regression are as follows 1 perform generative unsupervised learning layer wise on single autoencoder ae from lower to higher layers 1st layer i th layer 2 fine tuning using supervised learning on the entire deep learning architecture to tweak the weights from top to lower layers 3 activation of the regression model using the results of the top layer of the sae l th in this study the ann is selected as the regression model more information about the implemented dnn model is available in bengio et al 2014 input combinations for the dnn model can be found in table 3 similarly as when using the ann model we investigated the influence of the inclusion of additional meteorological input variables to the dnn model on the model performance compared to the case where only p and e are used as input variables table 3 2 3 2 3 regression tree rt model another data mining model that was applied in this study in order to evaluate its performance for the hydrological modelling of the selected nonhomogeneous catchments is the regression tree rt model the regression tree rt method is a nonparametric data driven method used to find the relationship between input variables i e rainfall and other tested meteorological variables and the target variable which is in our case daily discharge e g yang et al 2016 zabret et al 2018 in case of categorical data the outcome of the model is a class e g race whereas in the case of continuous numeric data the outcome is a number e g numerical value such as discharge the rt model consists of nodes splits defined as cutoffs for a particular input variable i e rainfall and other meteorological variables and leaves which are associated with the predicted values of the target variable i e discharge bezak et al 2018a 2018b each node contains only a part of the observations the subsets of the data which are not split further are called terminal nodes or leaves the main aim of the regression tree method is to determine the target value according to the splitting process in each leaf yang et al 2016 which means that by using the constructed rt model and values of input variables that are used to divide nodes one can calculate target variable values in our case study this means that based on the decision tree splitting process numeric values of discharges are predicted based on the numeric values of rainfall and other meteorological variables different tested combinations of the input variables for the rt model are shown in table 3 as in the aforementioned data mining models we applied the rt model for the estimation of q target variable using p e combination no 1 and p t ws rh sd and vpd combination no 2 as input variables in this study the regression tree was constructed using rpart therneau and atkinson 2018 and rpart plot milborrow 2017 packages which can be used in the r software r development core team 2015 we chose the anova splitting method for our case as we wanted to have the numerical type of the predicted variable rpart plot package enables visual interpretation of the results and at the same time indicates the threshold values of the input variables used for splitting the nodes additionally the percentage of observations can be presented for each individual node or just for terminal nodes as in our case 2 4 evaluation of model performances in order to evaluate a selected model s performance several indices were calculated where the idea was to observe several hydrological indicators such as the hydrograph as a whole with a special emphasis on low and high flows in order to compare the models performance in terms of their ability to simulate the entire hydrograph i e the entire extent of flow values including extreme values the pearson correlation coefficient r nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient ns and root mean square error rmse criteria were used rmse and ns are defined as follows 1 rmse 1 n i 1 n q sim i q obs i 2 2 ns 1 i 1 n q obs i q sim i 2 i 1 n q obs i q obs 2 where qsim i qobs i and n denote the simulated flow for the i th time step the observed flow for the i th time step and the data length respectively q obs represents the mean of the observed values additionally recession analyses were performed to compare the models ability to simulate low flows recession curve analysis is a useful method for water resources management and low flow estimation gustard and demuth 2009 recession constants of the observed and simulated flows were calculated using the following equations gustard and demuth 2009 k q t q t 1 3 c δ t ln k where qt represents the discharge for a specific time interval qt 1 is the discharge in the previous time interval k the slope of the curve fitting line between qt and qt 1 and c is the recession constant the recession analysis was carried out using lfstat package koffler et al 2016 which can be used in the r software r development core team 2015 the threshold level was selected based on the investigation of the bar chart of recession length as suggested by gustard and demuth 2009 the threshold is regarded as the starting point of the recession part of the hydrograph moreover the q50 threshold level was used for the recession analysis furthermore the master recession curve mrc method was selected for the analysis one can refer to the low flow estimation and prediction manual gustard and demuth 2009 for further details about the applied methodology furthermore we also investigated models ability to predict high flows firstly based on the observed discharge data we extracted the highest peak values above the selected threshold where on average five events per year were identified in order to ensure the independence of consecutive events we used the 5 days log a criterion where a is the catchment area in square miles e g bezak et al 2014 based on the dates of these events we also extracted the corresponding simulated discharge values in the next step we calculated the pearson correlation coefficient between these two series i e observed and simulated peaks a correlation coefficient value of 1 would indicate that the model is able to correctly predict timing and magnitude of the largest events additional analyses of low and high flows simulation were not performed in the case of the rt model since its results are discrete rather than continuous i e estimated discharge data only take certain values that are determined in the rt splitting process 3 results and discussion the performance of all applied models in the validation period 2011 2016 for two combinations of input variables table 3 for the selected catchments is shown in table 4 r and ns values close to 1 and rmse values close to 0 indicate good model performance additionally we also investigated models performance in terms of low flows where we focused on the recession part of the hydrograph table 5 shows calculated recession constants c for the observed and simulated flow values see the methodology described in section 2 4 if the modelled data have a similar recession constant to that of the observed data this indicates a better model performance furthermore a larger recession constant is characteristic of catchments with slow drainage and large contribution of groundwater whereas lower values indicate rapid drainage and limited storage of groundwater wmo 2008 investigation of the models performance in terms of their ability to simulate the highest flow values is presented in table 6 with pearson correlation coefficient values between the observed and modelled values for the most extreme events a correlation coefficient close to 1 indicates good model performance in terms of peak discharge values 3 1 evaluation of the gr4j modelling results the results in table 4 demonstrate that the gr4j lumped conceptual model yielded better rainfall runoff modeling results in the case of the ljubljanica river moste station compared to its four smaller sub catchments fig 5 shows detailed evaluation of the gr4j model for this case study calibration and validation results for the gr4j model for all five catchments are shown in the supplement in addition according to the selected performance criteria the gr4j model yielded the worst results for the nanoščica river catchment table 4 this finding is in accordance with that of van esse et al 2013 who demonstrated that generally a better model performance is obtained for larger catchments than for medium and small size catchments i e small 200 km2 200 km2 medium 600 km2 large 600 km2 van esse et al 2013 tested 13 different conceptual model structures using data from 237 catchments in france and for all the tested models the performance on larger catchments was on average better compared to smaller catchments van esse et al 2013 stated that this could be attributed to the fact that since hydrological processes at large scales are mixed and thus have smoother behaviour this kind of dynamics can be more easily modelled by the conceptual model structure merz et al 2009 who investigated 269 catchments in austria using the conceptual model also made similar conclusions this fact can be also confirmed with the results shown in table 6 where the results for the ljubljanica river catchment are better compared to other four smaller sub catchments furthermore the scatter diagrams of the observed and modelled flows in the validation period 2011 2016 for the cerkniščica nanoščica gradaščica and šujica rivers in fig 6 show an overestimation of the gr4j model results for the low flow simulations in the case of predominantly karst cerkniščica and nanoščica catchments moreover the results shown in table 5 indicate that for the gradaščica and šujica catchments the gr4j model is capable of reproducing the hydrograph recession dynamics better than for the other three tested catchments the comparison of the calculated recession constants indicates faster drainage and lower storage of groundwater for nanoščica and cerkniščica catchments whereas the results for other three catchments demonstrate lower drainage and larger contribution of groundwater table 5 this is consistent with the results of flow duration curves analysis fig 2 which demonstrate a noticeably larger slope of flow duration curves in the range of low flows for the nanoščica and cerkniščica rivers a much smaller contribution of groundwater flow to the nanoščica stream could be explained with geology since the catchment is dominated by impermeable rocks therefore the surface rainfall runoff processes are becoming more important this is also confirmed with the lowest rcs w value among the investigated cases we can conclude that the performance of the gr4j model seems better for predominantly non karst areas i e pre alpine karst dolomite and incomplete karst fig 1 than for predominantly karst areas high karst and impermeable rocks fig 1 in case of low flow prediction table 5 however it can also be seen that the scatter between the observed and simulated values for the gradaščica river is larger compared to the other investigated catchments perrin et al 2003 emphasized the applicability of the gr4j conceptual model in different catchments that have distinctive climate conditions the results of this study indicate that the gr4j model is more useful for the prediction of low flows in the case of the predominantly non karst gradaščica and šujica catchments than in the case of predominantly karst cerkniščica nanoščica and ljubljanica catchments fig 6 however several model selection criteria that are shown in table 4 indicate no significant difference between the gr4j model performances for different types of catchments i e comparison between karst and non karst catchment since for the nanoščica river catchment the gr4j model yielded the worst performance we also tested the gr6j model structure pushpalatha et al 2011 the application of this model slightly improved the overall model results the ns criterion for this model structure was 0 56 which means a slight improvement over the gr4j model version table 4 this improvement is also noticeable in low flow simulations thus it seems that for hydrological modelling of complex karst behaviour the gr6j model is slightly more appropriate than the gr4j model structure this kind of results could be expected because the gr6j model was proposed to improve low flow simulations thus the additional routing store was introduced together with two additional parameters i e coefficient for emptying exponential store and intercatchment exchange threshold pushpalatha et al 2011 however the main advantage of the gr4j model is its simplicity since it only includes four parameters similarly orth et al 2015 concluded that increased model complexity does not necessarily yield significantly better model performance 3 2 comparison of data mining methods using the gr4j model in the next step we evaluated the performance of the data driven ann model for the same five selected catchments fig 1 the performance of the ann model for two different input combinations in the validation period 2011 2016 indicated in table 3 is shown in fig 7 and table 4 it seems that the ann model similarly to the gr4j model overestimates low flows in case of the predominantly karst catchments of cerkniščica nanoščica and ljubljanica rivers for both input combinations fig 7 however recession analysis shows that recession constant values for the simulated flows predicted by the ann model and for observed flows for some catchments are closer to each other as is the case for the gr4j model table 5 this demonstrates that for the simulation of the recession part of the hydrograph in the case of complex karst areas the ann model might be more suitable than the gr4j model moreover slight underestimation of high flows can be observed for these rivers this is also confirmed by the results shown in table 6 some limitations of the ann model were also recognised by other researchers kurtulus and razack 2007 presented the incapability of the ann model for extreme flow forecasting similar conclusions can also be drawn in this study where ann and dnn methods yielded slightly worse performance when investigating only models ability to simulate the highest peak discharge values compared to the gr4j model furthermore heuvelmans et al 2006 stated that the ann method has a limited ability to simulate flows that have different characteristics than training data in other words training and validation periods should have similar data characteristics in order to obtain better results one could expect that the data mining models such as ann models are more suitable for modelling low flow dynamics of karst areas since their structure is only data dependent and does not use a pre defined model structure as in the case of the conceptual model however it seems that the ann model structure is not able to significantly improve the low flow modelling results for the predominantly karst catchments compared to the conceptual gr4j model the reason could be that the number of analysed low flow values i e smaller than q95 is smaller than the number of flow values close to q50 i e mean catchment conditions thus the ann model structure is not able to identify the low flow dynamics the results presented in table 4 indicate that ann yielded worse overall modelling results than the gr4j model taking into account the selected performance criteria shown in section 2 4 while using the same input variables as those used by the conceptual hydrological model despite the fact that we also tried to simulate flows using several additional input variables comb no 2 instead of evapotranspiration data comb no 1 the overall model performance was not significantly better similarly jimeno saez et al 2018 found that the swat model yielded better low flow modelling results than the ann method however they found that ann yielded better high flow performance than the swat model the swat model peak inefficiency was also recognised in other studies e g kim et al 2015 while gr4j generally yields good peak flow modelling results e g van esse et al 2013 however tegegne et al 2017 found that the gr4j model yielded worse modelling results than the swat model the opposite conclusions can be made based on the results presented in this study since the gr4j model yielded higher ns values and the ns coefficient is known to be very sensitive to the peaks in data e g van esse et al 2013 since the ann model was not able to provide an improvement of modelling results for the selected karst catchments compared to the conceptual gr4j model we also tested the performance of the dnn model fig 8 shows dnn modelling results for two different input combinations the results presented in table 4 indicate the best performance of the dnn model in the case of the ljubljanica river catchment for both combinations of input variables results also demonstrate that the dnn model exhibits the worst performance according to the selected model performance criteria for the predominantly non karst šujica and gradaščica river catchments both tested combinations of input parameters when only p and e were used as input variables i e comb no 1 the scatter between the observed and simulated low flows was relatively high for the predominantly karst cerkniščica nanoščica and ljubljanica catchments fig 8 this means that in karst catchments the dnn model also did not yield noticeable improvement in terms of modelling results compared to the conceptual gr4j model this can also be confirmed by the results presented in tables 5 and 6 despite the fact that the dnn method yielded slightly better results according to the selected criteria in some cases on the other hand the comparison of high flow simulations demonstrates the relatively high spread between the modelled and observed flows in the case of the gradaščica river compared to other catchments fig 8 moreover the comparison of low flows in the case that all input variables p t ws rh sd vpd were used for runoff modelling demonstrate relatively high differences between the modelled and observed flows in the case of the predominantly karst cerkniščica and nanoščica catchments furthermore for the ljubljanica river the performance criteria show better results when all variables are used as input in the dnn model compared to the model where only p and e are used as input variables table 4 interestingly the inclusion of additional input variables i e p t ws rh sd vpd in the model does not significantly improve the model performance on the other hand we should keep in mind that these additional variables all have some influence on the calculated reference evapotranspiration e g maček et al 2018 the results of the performance evaluation of rt models for all considered catchments are presented in table 4 the more complex example of the rt model which was created using all input variables i e p t ws rh sd vpd for the cerkniščica river is shown in fig 9 results demonstrate that the runoff from the cerkniščica catchment is mostly influenced by the amount of rainfall followed by air temperature similar rt models were also constructed for other considered catchments and in general the main conclusions are the same as expected the amount of rainfall is recognised as the most influential variable the results in table 4 indicate that the rt model yielded worse results compared to other considered models according to the selected performance criteria for both input combinations similarly as for the ann model the rt model performance is the worst for the nanoščica and ljubljanica rivers moreover as in the case of the ann and dnn model the use of additional input variables comb no 1 instead of evapotranspiration comb no 2 did not significantly improve the modelling results this means that additional meteorological input data do not provide a significant model performance improvement for complex nonhomogeneous catchments that were investigated in this study which indicates that catchment complexity cannot be compensated by inclusion of additional data furthermore the rt model was also not able to improve the model performance with respect to the gr4j model it should be also noted that the predicted flows by the rt model exhibit step function characteristics rather than a continuous target variable hayes et al 2015 also stated that the tree structure of the rt model might not be coherent with the predicted variable for the new samples because of the high variance thus this could also affect the performance of the rt model comparison between calibration and validation results indicates that all tested methods yielded slightly better calibration results compared to the validation results shown in table 4 on average for five tested catchments for three performance criteria from around 5 to 15 moreover the differences between calibration and validation results were the smallest for the gr4j model followed by the ann and dnn methods which could also indicate a slight advantage of the gr4j model in terms of its ability to simulate runoff using input data that were not used for the model calibration 4 conclusion in this study the performance of the gr4j ann dnn and rt models was investigated for the karst ljubljanica river catchment and its smaller cerkniščica nanoščica gradaščica šujica sub catchments with different geological characteristics daily time step was used and the data for the period 2000 to 2016 were divided into calibration 2000 2010 and validation 2011 2016 datasets to compare the performance of gr4j ann dnn and rt models r rmse and ns evaluation criteria were applied in addition recession analysis and correlation analysis of the maximum peak values were performed in order to additionally investigate the low and high flow model performance based on the presented results we conclude the following the gr4j model is a more useful tool for daily rainfall runoff modelling in the case of the predominantly non karst catchments than in the case of the predominantly karst catchments this was somehow expected since karst is an extremely heterogeneous formation and therefore karst catchments represent complex water systems difficult to present well with conceptual models bonacci and andrić 2015 the largest differences in the model performance are observed in the case of low flow simulations this conclusion is also verified by the additional recession analysis the enhanced model structure gr6j is slightly more suitable for modelling of low flows compared to the gr4j model for the predominantly karst nanoščica catchment however the fit between simulated high flows by the gr4j model and the observed high flows in predominantly karst and non karst catchments is relatively similar thus it seems that all tested catchments have a similar high flow behaviour despite the different catchment characteristics overall gr4j yielded better results i e overall performance and ability to model peak values compared to the other applied methods however ann and dnn data driven models were slightly more successful in modelling the low flow dynamics i e hydrograph recession in predominantly karst catchments nanoščica and cerkniščica compared to the gr4j lumped conceptual model structure moreover differences between calibration and validation results are the smallest for the gr4j model which could be regarded as an additional advantage of this model the inclusion of additional meteorological variables in the analysis i e p t ws rh sd vpd does not have a significant impact on the modelled flow values compared to the model structures where only p and e were used as input variables this means that the use of additional meteorological data does not provide a significant improvement in model performance in case of complex nonhomogeneous karst catchments in general the rt model yielded the worst results among the applied methods and can be regarded as the least suitable for daily rainfall runoff modelling among the investigated models declaration of competing interest author declares that there is no

6280,hydrological modelling is a challenging and significant issue especially in nonhomogeneous catchments in terms of geology and it is an essential part of water resources management in this study daily rainfall runoff modelling was carried out using the lumped conceptual model the artificial neural network ann the deep neural network dnn and regression tree rt data mining models for the nonhomogeneous karst ljubljanica catchment and four of its sub catchments in slovenia with different geological characteristics model performance was evaluated using several performance criteria and additional investigation of low and high flows was carried out the results of the study indicate that the génie rural à 4 paramètres journalier gr4j lumped conceptual model yielded better modelling performance compared to the data driven models namely ann dnn and rt models moreover the enhanced version of the gr4j model i e gr6j also yielded good performance in terms of the recession part the rt model yielded the worst performance regarding runoff forecasting among the examined models in the case of all five investigated catchments however ann and dnn data driven models were slightly more successful in modelling the hydrograph recession in the case of karst sub catchments compared to the gr4j lumped conceptual model structure inclusion of additional meteorological variables to ann and dnn does not significantly improve modelling results keywords hydrological model lumped conceptual model data mining karst nonhomogeneous catchment ljubljanica river 1 introduction hydrological modelling is very important for water resources management development and planning moreover hydrological modelling is a crucial component of predicting the hydrological variables needed for the design of water structures and other measures used for flood prevention as well as for the prediction and management of droughts e g bonacci and ljubenkov 2008 nayak et al 2013 bezak et al 2018a 2018b various methods can be used for hydrological modelling such as empirical models conceptual models data mining techniques e g de vos and rientjes 2007 salerno and tartari 2009 makwana and tiwari 2017 the main advantage of conceptual models compared to empirical and data driven models is that hydrological processes that occur within a catchment are described conceptually with the model structure however in the case of complex catchments such as karst areas which are highly non linear and hierarchical systems this kind of representation may not be adequate to improve modelling results since large ice free continental areas are underlain by karst e g 35 of europe and they are in many places around the world crucial for drinking water supply ford and williams 2007 hartmann et al 2014 additional evaluation of different hydrological models in such areas is even more important goyal et al 2017 in the case of karst areas data mining models could be regarded as an interesting alternative to the conceptual models since due to the non homogeneous geological structure preferential underground flow paths sinks ponors and springs that can be found in karst areas these features are often hard to describe with the conceptual model structure thus investigations into applications of the data mining methods for hydrological modelling in the case of regions where the knowledge about hydrological processes is rather limited i e karst catchments could lead to the development of enhanced models that would yield better modelling results many researchers have compared various data mining techniques with other methods for hydrological modelling of flows in non karstic catchments e g demirel et al 2009 nayak et al 2013 sahay and srivastava 2014 bai et al 2016 humphrey et al 2016 for example nayak et al 2013 analyzed the performance of two data mining based models namely the wavelet based neural network model wnn the artificial neural network ann and the conceptual nedbør afstrømnings model for rainfall runoff modelling in the malaprabha catchment in india they demonstrated that the wnn model performed better in estimating runoff than the other two models the modelling result presented by nayak et al 2013 also demonstrated that data driven models could be a useful tool for predicting runoff when the underlying physical relationships are not fully known or there are not enough data to apply a numerical model furthermore humphrey et al 2016 investigated the performance of a hybrid model using the simulated soil moisture output of the génie rural à 4 paramètres journalier gr4j conceptual model as input data to the data mining based ann model in three catchments in south australia where baseflow represents a significant proportion of the streamflow they demonstrated that the hybrid model yielded better performance than both individual models because of its ability to easily include groundwater data as well as initial soil moisture conditions in the model however the greatest weakness of the hybrid approach is that it requires a lot of time and expertise of the modeller demirel et al 2009 applied the data driven ann model and the process based soil water assessment tool swat model for daily streamflow forecasting in the pracana catchment in portugal they stated that the ann model outperformed the swat model especially in the estimation of peak flows they argued that the peak flow simulation inefficiency of the conceptual model could be caused by the formulation of processes used in the swat model and that the lag time of one day may be the reason of not capturing phenomena of high frequency occurrences studies applying different hydrological models in karst areas have already been conducted for example liu et al 2005 modified an existing physically based and distributed hydrological model named water and energy transfer between soil plants and atmosphere wetspa and applied it to estimating flows in a karst catchment that is located in north western vietnam in order to simulate the karst aquifer more effectively the results demonstrated that the modified model is able to simulate reasonably well the generation of stormflows however the model does not allow for determining the internal structure and spatial disposition of contributions in the aquifer furthermore rimmer and salingar 2006 developed the hydrological model for karst environment hymke which they described as a gray box model for daily rainfall streamflow modelling in karst areas they tried to include attributes describing preferential flow that recharges the groundwater and therewith solves the problem of uncorrelated baseflow and surface flow in karst areas the model was applied to the major tributaries of the upper catchment of the jordan river in israel they stated that the hymke model exhibits good performance for modelling streamflow in this case study in recent years different data driven models were utilized in order to improve the modelling results in karst areas kurtulus and razack 2007 utilized a neural network model in order to forecast the discharge of a karst aquifer in southwest france they indicated high applicability of the data driven ann model for the rainfall runoff relationship modelling in karst areas although the ann approach captures well the most important features of the karst system dynamics authors noted that the model s limitations regarding modelling of high flows warrant further research a few years later the same authors kurtulus and razack 2010 compared the aforementioned ann model with the adaptive neuro fuzzy interface system anfis model at the same karst area in south west france as a result they found out that the anfis model yields slightly better modelling performance than the ann model with respect to the estimation of peak flows furthermore goyal et al 2017 applied different support vector regression based svr models for the prediction of discharge in two karst springs in greece and they demonstrated that the svr model could be relatively successfully applied for hydrological modelling in karst areas they argued that the results are comparable to those of ann the above literature review demonstrates that various models have been applied to simulate flows in different karst areas around the world but with different success rates furthermore studies comparing process based and data driven model performance in nonhomogeneous karst areas are rare since most of the studies deal with one model or alternatively more models of the same type additionally most of the studies are focused particularly on simulation performance of average and high flows and not so much on low flows which is the case in our study where we will focus on a different aspect of the hydrological regime the main scientific question that is investigated in this study is if data mining models provide a valuable alternative to the selected lumped conceptual hydrological model in terms of model efficiency when investigating karst catchments in order to answer the main scientific question we carried out daily rainfall runoff modelling using a lumped conceptual model génie rural à 4 paramètres journalier gr4j and three different data mining models namely the artificial neural network ann the deep neural network dnn and the regression tree rt model for simulating flows in the nonhomogeneous karst ljubljanica catchment around 1800 km2 in slovenia europe and its four selected small sub catchments about 50 km2 with different geological characteristics the main aim of this study is to compare and evaluate the performance of all aforementioned models that were applied to all five catchments having predominantly karst or non karst characteristics with a special emphasis on low and high flows moreover the influence of the substitution of the evapotranspiration input variable with meteorological variables e g air temperature saturation vapour pressure deficit in the data mining model structures on the modelling performance was investigated the main idea behind the selection of sub catchments with different characteristics was to evaluate the impact of karst characteristics on the model s performance which can be regarded as a novelty of this paper 2 data and methods 2 1 the ljubljanica river catchment the ljubljanica river catchment was selected as a case study in this study due to its nonhomogeneous characteristics mostly in terms of geology and karst features the ljubljanica river drains into the sava river and is part of the danube river basin the catchment area up to the moste gauging station is 1778 km2 fig 1 and table 1 kovačič and ravbar 2016 provided a detailed description of the complex ljubljanica river system and its main karst characteristics here we provide only a short overview of the complex karst system the dominant land use types in the ljubljanica river catchment are forest and semi natural areas most of the ljubjanica river catchment has temperate continental characteristics maximum rainfall amounts are measured around high mountain peaks such as the javorniki karst plateau where the annual rainfall exceeds 2000 mm however the lower part of the catchment usually receives around 1400 mm of rain per year most of the ljubljanica river catchment lies in dinaric karst and some smaller parts of the catchments can also be defined as pre alpine karst fig 1 most of the ljubljanica river catchment is composed of porous carbonate rocks where limestone and dolomite are dominant and only a small part northern lower part consists of non carbonate rocks several sinking rivers e g stržen pivka malenščica unica are located in this catchment which in combination with the river recharge from the high karst plateaus e g javorniki snežnik yields a complex hydrological behaviour kovačič and ravbar 2016 the exact catchment area for these rivers e g stržen pivka malenščica unica cannot be precisely determined in order to investigate these nonhomogeneous characteristics and hydrological behaviour of the ljubljanica river catchment we selected its four smaller sub catchments that have discharge data available from 2000 until 2016 table 1 we focused on catchments that have well defined catchment boundaries with the purpose of fitting different models to the data e g the catchment area is needed to convert m3 s to mm which is used as an input to the conceptual model firstly we selected two predominantly karst sub catchments namely the cerkniščica river cerknica discharge gauging station which is located in dinaric karst and the nanoščica river mali otok discharge gauging station whose catchment area has an impermeable surface with significant underground flow through the karst edge i e boundary between karst and istria fig 1 the cerkniščica is the largest surface river that drains into lake cerknica most of the river network that drains into lake cerknica is flowing underground and has karst characteristics šušteršič and šušteršič 2003 kovačič and ravbar 2016 the nanoščica river is part of the pivka river catchment and these two rivers flow underground into the world famous postojna cave several springs of the nanoščica river are recharged from the nanos karst plateau we also selected two smaller catchments namely the gradaščica dvor discharge gauging station and the šujica razori discharge gauging station that are located in pre alpine karst and where catchment features are mainly dolomite and incomplete karst fig 1 both rivers flow into the ljubljanica river in the ljubljana city centre a few kilometres before the moste gauging station due to the topographic characteristics of the headwater part of this area i e steep slopes flash floods frequently occur in the gradaščica and šujica catchments e g bezak et al 2013 šraj et al 2016 bezak et al 2017 kovačec and šraj 2017 thus the whole catchment of the ljubljanica river up to the moste gauging station combines several nonhomogeneous characteristics related to geology and karst features which means that the hydrological characteristics of the hydrographs measured at this location are complex this means that compared to the rivers that have a similar catchment area and do not have significant karst features the hydrographs at the moste station have a longer rising limb and a significantly longer recession part e g bezak et al 2015 the reason is in several sinks and springs that have limited hydraulic capacity which means that runoff water that exceeds a specific threshold is retained in the upper part of the ljubljanica catchment several karst poljes are located in this area such as lake cerknica or planina polje this kind of hydrological behaviour provides natural retention areas that reduce the flood risk at the location of the moste gauging station compared to the ljubljanica river catchment all of its four selected smaller sub catchments are characterised by a faster catchment response especially by the gradaščica and šujica rivers since they do not have similar karst features table 1 also provides information about the relationship between summer i e july september and winter i e january march mean runoff and rainfall expressed with coefficient rcs w as defined by van esse et al 2013 based on the calculated coefficients all five selected case studies can be regarded as groundwater dominated catchments rcs w 0 24 of which the nanoščica catchment is the closest to the mixed regime 0 15 rcs w 0 24 which demonstrates that direct runoff contribution of the nanoščica catchment is higher than that for the other four investigated catchments fig 2 shows flow duration curves for the period from 2000 until 2016 for all five considered catchments curves demonstrate that the nanoščica and cerkniščica rivers have lower low flows i e flow that is not exceeded more than 50 of time compared to the gradaščica and šujica rivers based on the flow duration curves characteristics one could assume that the nanoščica and cerkniščica rivers have different storage characteristics than the gradaščica and šujica rivers despite similar catchment area size climate and land use characteristics moreover these differences could be related to the catchments different geology structure thus due to the differences in low flow characteristics and different geological properties we can assume that four considered sub catchments are not completely homogeneous this is important from the hydrological modelling perspective since we will investigate if different model types are able to provide similar performance despite the differences in the hydrological behaviour of the selected catchments 2 2 data daily data i e discharge rainfall and evapotranspiration from 2000 to 2016 were used in this study data are separated into two parts data from 2000 to 2010 were used for calibration and data from 2011 to 2016 for validation it can be assumed that the calibration and validation periods have similar climate characteristics table 2 shows selected discharge q rainfall p and evapotranspiration e measuring stations that were used in the study for each considered catchment in this study we applied reference evapotranspiration data calculated using the penman monteith equation for the selected meteorological stations a detailed description of the reference evapotranspiration data in slovenia can be found in maček et al 2018 a comparison between potential evapotranspiration calculated using oudin et al 2005 and reference evapotranspiration calculated using penman monteith method revealed a high correlation between these two variables selected rainfall and meteorological stations as well as thiessen polygons that were applied to calculate areal rainfall for the ljubljanica river up to the moste discharge gauging station are shown in fig 3 for the ljubljanica river catchment evapotranspiration was calculated as an average of postojna and ljubljana meteorological stations whereas the postojna meteorological station was the reference station for the cerkniščica and nanoščica catchments and the ljubljana meteorological station for the gradaščica and šujica catchments table 2 for some rainfall stations there were some missing rainfall data which were estimated using linear regression between the rainfall data of the considered station and the nearest station with data available for the missing period in order to determine the most suitable station the correlation between the rainfall data of neighbouring stations were taken into consideration as well as similarity of the stations elevation we also used daily air temperature t daily wind speed ws daily relative humidity rh daily sun duration sd and saturation vapour pressure deficit vpd as inputs to the ann and dnn models these data are only available for the postojna and ljubljana meteorological stations more information about the relationship among the aforementioned variables of the considered stations can be found in maček et al 2018 2 3 hydrological models 2 3 1 lumped gr4j hydrological model the gr4j model was developed based on the three parameter version of the génie rural journalier grj model with the aim to improve the low flow simulations perrin et al 2003 the idea behind the model development was to obtain the model structure as simple as possible and not to introduce more parameters than needed in order to obtain good modelling results e g perrin et al 2003 the gr4j lumped conceptual model uses daily p and e as input data for daily runoff modelling the gr4j model has four parameters i e x1 x2 x3 and x4 where x1 represents the maximum capacity of the production store in mm x2 the groundwater exchange coefficient x3 the one day ahead maximum capacity of the routing store in mm and x4 the unit hydrograph time base based on rainfall p and evapotranspiration e data the model calculates net rainfall pn which is then used to fill the production store ps and for runoff routing pn ps production store is emptied by percolation perc f s x1 where s is the production store level or by the actual evaporation rate es f s x1 en where en is net evapotranspiration the difference between net rainfall and rainfall that is used to fill the production store pn ps is then used together with percolation from the production store perc to calculate flow pr several routing steps are then applied to obtain the modelled flow values pr is divided into two parts 90 is being routed by the unit hydrograph hu1 x4 parameter and a routing store i e x3 parameter while 10 is routed by the unit hydrograph hu2 x4 parameter in the case of the hu2 and the routing store a groundwater exchange term gain or loss is also introduced x2 parameter moreover the first model parameter i e x1 defines the production store size and the other three parameters are related to the routing calculations for further details about the lumped conceptual gr4j daily rainfall runoff model and detailed equations that are used in the scope of the model one should refer to perrin et al 2003 model calibration was performed using the method proposed by michel 1991 where the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nash and sutcliffe 1970 was selected as the error criterion function the selected calibration algorithm combines global and local approaches for parameter estimation michel 1991 coron et al 2017 coron et al 2018 in this study gr4j model calibration and runoff simulation was done using airgr package coron et al 2017 coron et al 2018 which can be used in the r software r development core team 2015 additionally for the nanoščica river catchment the performance of the génie rural à 6 paramètres journalier gr6j model was tested that in comparison with the gr4j model uses two additional parameters and enhanced model structure i e additional routing store which is able to better predict low flows pushpalatha et al 2011 this model structure was proposed based on testing several different model structures using the downward modelling perspective pushpalatha et al 2011 2 3 2 data mining models 2 3 2 1 artificial neural network ann model the feed forward artificial neural network ann was also applied for rainfall runoff modelling in this study the ann structure is defined with several nodes that can be regarded as the processing elements and are often named neurons e g kurtulus and razack 2007 each neuron is connected to other neurons and the neuron task is to process the input signal and transform it to the output signal e g kurtulus and razack 2007 the ann structure used in this study is composed from an input layer multiple hidden layers and an output layer where a layer presents a group of neurons that have the same patterns of connections e g kurtulus and razack 2007 moreover connections among different layers have weights wkj that are activated during simulation and training li et al 2016 table 3 shows different input combinations that were tested to obtain the maximum performance of the ann model we tested two different cases in the first case the same input variables as those used in the gr4j model were applied and in the second case additional variables were included in the model as an example the structure of the 6 7 1 ann model is shown in fig 4 the model structure for the ann model was selected based on the trial and error principle for the training of the ann model the levenberg marquardt back propagation algorithm was used in this study various studies presented the advantages of utilization of the levenberg marquardt back propagation algorithm for the training of the ann model e g aqil et al 2007a badrzadeh et al 2013 tongal and booij 2018 furthermore the levenberg marquardt back propagation algorithm is very useful regarding its fast convergence ability robustness and simple usage demuth and beale 1998 aqil et al 2007b in addition since the tangent sigmoid function presents a fast process for the training of the dataset and secures more accurate forecasting results compared to the sigmoid function it was preferred in this study maier et al 1998 zadeh et al 2010 to obtain additional information about the ann model one can refer to the matlab neural network toolbox user s guide 2018 2 3 2 2 deep neural network dnn model the dnn model can be regarded as an improvement over the ann model since the back propagation algorithm used for the training of the ann model has some disadvantages e g convergence to the local minimum that have been reported in the literature for description see li et al 2016 and references cited therein and the dnn method improves these disadvantages similarly to ann dnn has three elements input hidden and output layer encoder function and decoder function weights and bias values between neighbouring layers are applied in the dnn model one of the differences between two methods is also in the number of layers which means that dnn has more hidden layers than ann the stacked auto encoder sae model was used as part of the hidden layer in order to improve the model performance compared to ann the output of the previous layer of the auto encoder will become the input of the next layer of the auto encoder the encoder converts the input into a hidden representation and then the decoder maps the hidden layer back to reconstruct the input e g li et al 2016 thus the purpose of the sae is to build a network the optimal parameters are obtained through optimization of the loss function e g li et al 2016 the steps of the sae modelling for regression are as follows 1 perform generative unsupervised learning layer wise on single autoencoder ae from lower to higher layers 1st layer i th layer 2 fine tuning using supervised learning on the entire deep learning architecture to tweak the weights from top to lower layers 3 activation of the regression model using the results of the top layer of the sae l th in this study the ann is selected as the regression model more information about the implemented dnn model is available in bengio et al 2014 input combinations for the dnn model can be found in table 3 similarly as when using the ann model we investigated the influence of the inclusion of additional meteorological input variables to the dnn model on the model performance compared to the case where only p and e are used as input variables table 3 2 3 2 3 regression tree rt model another data mining model that was applied in this study in order to evaluate its performance for the hydrological modelling of the selected nonhomogeneous catchments is the regression tree rt model the regression tree rt method is a nonparametric data driven method used to find the relationship between input variables i e rainfall and other tested meteorological variables and the target variable which is in our case daily discharge e g yang et al 2016 zabret et al 2018 in case of categorical data the outcome of the model is a class e g race whereas in the case of continuous numeric data the outcome is a number e g numerical value such as discharge the rt model consists of nodes splits defined as cutoffs for a particular input variable i e rainfall and other meteorological variables and leaves which are associated with the predicted values of the target variable i e discharge bezak et al 2018a 2018b each node contains only a part of the observations the subsets of the data which are not split further are called terminal nodes or leaves the main aim of the regression tree method is to determine the target value according to the splitting process in each leaf yang et al 2016 which means that by using the constructed rt model and values of input variables that are used to divide nodes one can calculate target variable values in our case study this means that based on the decision tree splitting process numeric values of discharges are predicted based on the numeric values of rainfall and other meteorological variables different tested combinations of the input variables for the rt model are shown in table 3 as in the aforementioned data mining models we applied the rt model for the estimation of q target variable using p e combination no 1 and p t ws rh sd and vpd combination no 2 as input variables in this study the regression tree was constructed using rpart therneau and atkinson 2018 and rpart plot milborrow 2017 packages which can be used in the r software r development core team 2015 we chose the anova splitting method for our case as we wanted to have the numerical type of the predicted variable rpart plot package enables visual interpretation of the results and at the same time indicates the threshold values of the input variables used for splitting the nodes additionally the percentage of observations can be presented for each individual node or just for terminal nodes as in our case 2 4 evaluation of model performances in order to evaluate a selected model s performance several indices were calculated where the idea was to observe several hydrological indicators such as the hydrograph as a whole with a special emphasis on low and high flows in order to compare the models performance in terms of their ability to simulate the entire hydrograph i e the entire extent of flow values including extreme values the pearson correlation coefficient r nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient ns and root mean square error rmse criteria were used rmse and ns are defined as follows 1 rmse 1 n i 1 n q sim i q obs i 2 2 ns 1 i 1 n q obs i q sim i 2 i 1 n q obs i q obs 2 where qsim i qobs i and n denote the simulated flow for the i th time step the observed flow for the i th time step and the data length respectively q obs represents the mean of the observed values additionally recession analyses were performed to compare the models ability to simulate low flows recession curve analysis is a useful method for water resources management and low flow estimation gustard and demuth 2009 recession constants of the observed and simulated flows were calculated using the following equations gustard and demuth 2009 k q t q t 1 3 c δ t ln k where qt represents the discharge for a specific time interval qt 1 is the discharge in the previous time interval k the slope of the curve fitting line between qt and qt 1 and c is the recession constant the recession analysis was carried out using lfstat package koffler et al 2016 which can be used in the r software r development core team 2015 the threshold level was selected based on the investigation of the bar chart of recession length as suggested by gustard and demuth 2009 the threshold is regarded as the starting point of the recession part of the hydrograph moreover the q50 threshold level was used for the recession analysis furthermore the master recession curve mrc method was selected for the analysis one can refer to the low flow estimation and prediction manual gustard and demuth 2009 for further details about the applied methodology furthermore we also investigated models ability to predict high flows firstly based on the observed discharge data we extracted the highest peak values above the selected threshold where on average five events per year were identified in order to ensure the independence of consecutive events we used the 5 days log a criterion where a is the catchment area in square miles e g bezak et al 2014 based on the dates of these events we also extracted the corresponding simulated discharge values in the next step we calculated the pearson correlation coefficient between these two series i e observed and simulated peaks a correlation coefficient value of 1 would indicate that the model is able to correctly predict timing and magnitude of the largest events additional analyses of low and high flows simulation were not performed in the case of the rt model since its results are discrete rather than continuous i e estimated discharge data only take certain values that are determined in the rt splitting process 3 results and discussion the performance of all applied models in the validation period 2011 2016 for two combinations of input variables table 3 for the selected catchments is shown in table 4 r and ns values close to 1 and rmse values close to 0 indicate good model performance additionally we also investigated models performance in terms of low flows where we focused on the recession part of the hydrograph table 5 shows calculated recession constants c for the observed and simulated flow values see the methodology described in section 2 4 if the modelled data have a similar recession constant to that of the observed data this indicates a better model performance furthermore a larger recession constant is characteristic of catchments with slow drainage and large contribution of groundwater whereas lower values indicate rapid drainage and limited storage of groundwater wmo 2008 investigation of the models performance in terms of their ability to simulate the highest flow values is presented in table 6 with pearson correlation coefficient values between the observed and modelled values for the most extreme events a correlation coefficient close to 1 indicates good model performance in terms of peak discharge values 3 1 evaluation of the gr4j modelling results the results in table 4 demonstrate that the gr4j lumped conceptual model yielded better rainfall runoff modeling results in the case of the ljubljanica river moste station compared to its four smaller sub catchments fig 5 shows detailed evaluation of the gr4j model for this case study calibration and validation results for the gr4j model for all five catchments are shown in the supplement in addition according to the selected performance criteria the gr4j model yielded the worst results for the nanoščica river catchment table 4 this finding is in accordance with that of van esse et al 2013 who demonstrated that generally a better model performance is obtained for larger catchments than for medium and small size catchments i e small 200 km2 200 km2 medium 600 km2 large 600 km2 van esse et al 2013 tested 13 different conceptual model structures using data from 237 catchments in france and for all the tested models the performance on larger catchments was on average better compared to smaller catchments van esse et al 2013 stated that this could be attributed to the fact that since hydrological processes at large scales are mixed and thus have smoother behaviour this kind of dynamics can be more easily modelled by the conceptual model structure merz et al 2009 who investigated 269 catchments in austria using the conceptual model also made similar conclusions this fact can be also confirmed with the results shown in table 6 where the results for the ljubljanica river catchment are better compared to other four smaller sub catchments furthermore the scatter diagrams of the observed and modelled flows in the validation period 2011 2016 for the cerkniščica nanoščica gradaščica and šujica rivers in fig 6 show an overestimation of the gr4j model results for the low flow simulations in the case of predominantly karst cerkniščica and nanoščica catchments moreover the results shown in table 5 indicate that for the gradaščica and šujica catchments the gr4j model is capable of reproducing the hydrograph recession dynamics better than for the other three tested catchments the comparison of the calculated recession constants indicates faster drainage and lower storage of groundwater for nanoščica and cerkniščica catchments whereas the results for other three catchments demonstrate lower drainage and larger contribution of groundwater table 5 this is consistent with the results of flow duration curves analysis fig 2 which demonstrate a noticeably larger slope of flow duration curves in the range of low flows for the nanoščica and cerkniščica rivers a much smaller contribution of groundwater flow to the nanoščica stream could be explained with geology since the catchment is dominated by impermeable rocks therefore the surface rainfall runoff processes are becoming more important this is also confirmed with the lowest rcs w value among the investigated cases we can conclude that the performance of the gr4j model seems better for predominantly non karst areas i e pre alpine karst dolomite and incomplete karst fig 1 than for predominantly karst areas high karst and impermeable rocks fig 1 in case of low flow prediction table 5 however it can also be seen that the scatter between the observed and simulated values for the gradaščica river is larger compared to the other investigated catchments perrin et al 2003 emphasized the applicability of the gr4j conceptual model in different catchments that have distinctive climate conditions the results of this study indicate that the gr4j model is more useful for the prediction of low flows in the case of the predominantly non karst gradaščica and šujica catchments than in the case of predominantly karst cerkniščica nanoščica and ljubljanica catchments fig 6 however several model selection criteria that are shown in table 4 indicate no significant difference between the gr4j model performances for different types of catchments i e comparison between karst and non karst catchment since for the nanoščica river catchment the gr4j model yielded the worst performance we also tested the gr6j model structure pushpalatha et al 2011 the application of this model slightly improved the overall model results the ns criterion for this model structure was 0 56 which means a slight improvement over the gr4j model version table 4 this improvement is also noticeable in low flow simulations thus it seems that for hydrological modelling of complex karst behaviour the gr6j model is slightly more appropriate than the gr4j model structure this kind of results could be expected because the gr6j model was proposed to improve low flow simulations thus the additional routing store was introduced together with two additional parameters i e coefficient for emptying exponential store and intercatchment exchange threshold pushpalatha et al 2011 however the main advantage of the gr4j model is its simplicity since it only includes four parameters similarly orth et al 2015 concluded that increased model complexity does not necessarily yield significantly better model performance 3 2 comparison of data mining methods using the gr4j model in the next step we evaluated the performance of the data driven ann model for the same five selected catchments fig 1 the performance of the ann model for two different input combinations in the validation period 2011 2016 indicated in table 3 is shown in fig 7 and table 4 it seems that the ann model similarly to the gr4j model overestimates low flows in case of the predominantly karst catchments of cerkniščica nanoščica and ljubljanica rivers for both input combinations fig 7 however recession analysis shows that recession constant values for the simulated flows predicted by the ann model and for observed flows for some catchments are closer to each other as is the case for the gr4j model table 5 this demonstrates that for the simulation of the recession part of the hydrograph in the case of complex karst areas the ann model might be more suitable than the gr4j model moreover slight underestimation of high flows can be observed for these rivers this is also confirmed by the results shown in table 6 some limitations of the ann model were also recognised by other researchers kurtulus and razack 2007 presented the incapability of the ann model for extreme flow forecasting similar conclusions can also be drawn in this study where ann and dnn methods yielded slightly worse performance when investigating only models ability to simulate the highest peak discharge values compared to the gr4j model furthermore heuvelmans et al 2006 stated that the ann method has a limited ability to simulate flows that have different characteristics than training data in other words training and validation periods should have similar data characteristics in order to obtain better results one could expect that the data mining models such as ann models are more suitable for modelling low flow dynamics of karst areas since their structure is only data dependent and does not use a pre defined model structure as in the case of the conceptual model however it seems that the ann model structure is not able to significantly improve the low flow modelling results for the predominantly karst catchments compared to the conceptual gr4j model the reason could be that the number of analysed low flow values i e smaller than q95 is smaller than the number of flow values close to q50 i e mean catchment conditions thus the ann model structure is not able to identify the low flow dynamics the results presented in table 4 indicate that ann yielded worse overall modelling results than the gr4j model taking into account the selected performance criteria shown in section 2 4 while using the same input variables as those used by the conceptual hydrological model despite the fact that we also tried to simulate flows using several additional input variables comb no 2 instead of evapotranspiration data comb no 1 the overall model performance was not significantly better similarly jimeno saez et al 2018 found that the swat model yielded better low flow modelling results than the ann method however they found that ann yielded better high flow performance than the swat model the swat model peak inefficiency was also recognised in other studies e g kim et al 2015 while gr4j generally yields good peak flow modelling results e g van esse et al 2013 however tegegne et al 2017 found that the gr4j model yielded worse modelling results than the swat model the opposite conclusions can be made based on the results presented in this study since the gr4j model yielded higher ns values and the ns coefficient is known to be very sensitive to the peaks in data e g van esse et al 2013 since the ann model was not able to provide an improvement of modelling results for the selected karst catchments compared to the conceptual gr4j model we also tested the performance of the dnn model fig 8 shows dnn modelling results for two different input combinations the results presented in table 4 indicate the best performance of the dnn model in the case of the ljubljanica river catchment for both combinations of input variables results also demonstrate that the dnn model exhibits the worst performance according to the selected model performance criteria for the predominantly non karst šujica and gradaščica river catchments both tested combinations of input parameters when only p and e were used as input variables i e comb no 1 the scatter between the observed and simulated low flows was relatively high for the predominantly karst cerkniščica nanoščica and ljubljanica catchments fig 8 this means that in karst catchments the dnn model also did not yield noticeable improvement in terms of modelling results compared to the conceptual gr4j model this can also be confirmed by the results presented in tables 5 and 6 despite the fact that the dnn method yielded slightly better results according to the selected criteria in some cases on the other hand the comparison of high flow simulations demonstrates the relatively high spread between the modelled and observed flows in the case of the gradaščica river compared to other catchments fig 8 moreover the comparison of low flows in the case that all input variables p t ws rh sd vpd were used for runoff modelling demonstrate relatively high differences between the modelled and observed flows in the case of the predominantly karst cerkniščica and nanoščica catchments furthermore for the ljubljanica river the performance criteria show better results when all variables are used as input in the dnn model compared to the model where only p and e are used as input variables table 4 interestingly the inclusion of additional input variables i e p t ws rh sd vpd in the model does not significantly improve the model performance on the other hand we should keep in mind that these additional variables all have some influence on the calculated reference evapotranspiration e g maček et al 2018 the results of the performance evaluation of rt models for all considered catchments are presented in table 4 the more complex example of the rt model which was created using all input variables i e p t ws rh sd vpd for the cerkniščica river is shown in fig 9 results demonstrate that the runoff from the cerkniščica catchment is mostly influenced by the amount of rainfall followed by air temperature similar rt models were also constructed for other considered catchments and in general the main conclusions are the same as expected the amount of rainfall is recognised as the most influential variable the results in table 4 indicate that the rt model yielded worse results compared to other considered models according to the selected performance criteria for both input combinations similarly as for the ann model the rt model performance is the worst for the nanoščica and ljubljanica rivers moreover as in the case of the ann and dnn model the use of additional input variables comb no 1 instead of evapotranspiration comb no 2 did not significantly improve the modelling results this means that additional meteorological input data do not provide a significant model performance improvement for complex nonhomogeneous catchments that were investigated in this study which indicates that catchment complexity cannot be compensated by inclusion of additional data furthermore the rt model was also not able to improve the model performance with respect to the gr4j model it should be also noted that the predicted flows by the rt model exhibit step function characteristics rather than a continuous target variable hayes et al 2015 also stated that the tree structure of the rt model might not be coherent with the predicted variable for the new samples because of the high variance thus this could also affect the performance of the rt model comparison between calibration and validation results indicates that all tested methods yielded slightly better calibration results compared to the validation results shown in table 4 on average for five tested catchments for three performance criteria from around 5 to 15 moreover the differences between calibration and validation results were the smallest for the gr4j model followed by the ann and dnn methods which could also indicate a slight advantage of the gr4j model in terms of its ability to simulate runoff using input data that were not used for the model calibration 4 conclusion in this study the performance of the gr4j ann dnn and rt models was investigated for the karst ljubljanica river catchment and its smaller cerkniščica nanoščica gradaščica šujica sub catchments with different geological characteristics daily time step was used and the data for the period 2000 to 2016 were divided into calibration 2000 2010 and validation 2011 2016 datasets to compare the performance of gr4j ann dnn and rt models r rmse and ns evaluation criteria were applied in addition recession analysis and correlation analysis of the maximum peak values were performed in order to additionally investigate the low and high flow model performance based on the presented results we conclude the following the gr4j model is a more useful tool for daily rainfall runoff modelling in the case of the predominantly non karst catchments than in the case of the predominantly karst catchments this was somehow expected since karst is an extremely heterogeneous formation and therefore karst catchments represent complex water systems difficult to present well with conceptual models bonacci and andrić 2015 the largest differences in the model performance are observed in the case of low flow simulations this conclusion is also verified by the additional recession analysis the enhanced model structure gr6j is slightly more suitable for modelling of low flows compared to the gr4j model for the predominantly karst nanoščica catchment however the fit between simulated high flows by the gr4j model and the observed high flows in predominantly karst and non karst catchments is relatively similar thus it seems that all tested catchments have a similar high flow behaviour despite the different catchment characteristics overall gr4j yielded better results i e overall performance and ability to model peak values compared to the other applied methods however ann and dnn data driven models were slightly more successful in modelling the low flow dynamics i e hydrograph recession in predominantly karst catchments nanoščica and cerkniščica compared to the gr4j lumped conceptual model structure moreover differences between calibration and validation results are the smallest for the gr4j model which could be regarded as an additional advantage of this model the inclusion of additional meteorological variables in the analysis i e p t ws rh sd vpd does not have a significant impact on the modelled flow values compared to the model structures where only p and e were used as input variables this means that the use of additional meteorological data does not provide a significant improvement in model performance in case of complex nonhomogeneous karst catchments in general the rt model yielded the worst results among the applied methods and can be regarded as the least suitable for daily rainfall runoff modelling among the investigated models declaration of competing interest author declares that there is no

6281,scenario neutral approaches are used increasingly as a means of stress testing climate sensitive systems to a range of plausible future climate conditions to ensure that these stress tests are able to explore system vulnerability it is necessary to generate hydrometeorological time series that represent all aspects of plausible future change e g averages seasonality extremes a promising approach to generating these time series is by inverting the stochastic weather generation problem to obtain weather time series that capture all the relevant statistical features of plausible future change the objective of this paper is to formalize this inverse approach to weather generation by both characterizing the process of optimizing weather generator parameters and proposing a numerically efficient solution that exploits prior knowledge and accounts for the complexity of the optimization landscape the proposed approach also provides a structured way to ensure the physical realism of the generated weather time series by using penalty based objective functions to focus the optimization on the climate features deemed most relevant to the system being analyzed a case study in adelaide australia is used to demonstrate specific implementations of this approach the use of bounds on the weather generators dramatically decreases the time taken to create time series and the use of penalties is shown to allow for change in some statistics to be prioritized while still ensuring the realism of the time series keywords scenario neutral stochastic weather generation bottom up inverse approach climate change impact assessment realistic perturbed hydrometeorological time series 1 introduction scenario neutral climate impact assessments are proving to be an effective way of assessing how a range of climate sensitive systems might respond to plausible future climate changes the scenario neutral approach has been applied recently to flood protection water supply and ecological systems culley et al 2016 poff et al 2016 prudhomme et al 2013 with these studies demonstrating that scenario neutral approaches both lead to important insights into overall system sensitivities and vulnerabilities and enable the identification of possible failure modes by determining how a system responds to step changes in climate prudhomme et al 2010 these approaches are also increasingly being used to provide decision theoretic information describing conditions whereby one system configuration or design option is preferred to another brown et al 2012 or approximating the maximum operational adaptive capacity of the system culley et al 2016 although most scenario neutral approaches have focused on changes in the mean state of climate variables culley et al 2016 prudhomme et al 2013 prudhomme et al 2010 spence and brown 2018 wilcke and bärring 2016 it is becoming increasingly apparent that critical system vulnerabilities may reside in other aspects of change including variability intermittency extremes seasonality and or inter annual persistence bussi et al 2016 guo et al 2017 steinschneider and brown 2013 an important implication is that if key sensitives are not identified major modes of system vulnerability may not be uncovered thereby negating the stated benefit of scenario neutral studies this poses a deep challenge to the viability of scenario neutral approaches how should weather and hydrometeorological time series be generated to capture all possible aspects of future change the primary approach currently available to address this challenge within the scenario neutral framework is through the use of stochastic weather generators which contain sufficient flexibility to simulate a wide variety of possible future changes while maintaining the statistical features commonly associated with weather time series guo et al 2018 steinschneider and brown 2013 the forward scaling approach presented by steinschneider and brown 2013 is capable of manipulating more complex measurements of precipitation like persistence by directly perturbing the parameters of a weather generator to generate baseline time series with different statistics however to produce the uniform perturbations to climate attributes required in a scenario neutral assessment this still requires some post processing of time series such as quantile mapping to represent targeted changes in climate given scaling methods are still used the range of attributes that can be perturbed is often limited to means and seasonality by directly adjusting the baseline time series to avoid the scaling process guo et al 2018 provided the first structured attempt at inverting the stochastic generation problem by varying the parameters of a stochastic generator through an optimization loop to simulate weather time series with pre specified statistics or attributes the generation of time series using this approach was demonstrated for three climate variables precipitation temperature and evapotranspiration guo et al 2017 and was benchmarked on a rainfall dataset from a catchment in south australia guo et al 2018 as scenario neutral approaches are applied to increasingly complex systems it becomes necessary to explore increasing numbers of hydrometeorological variables and statistics of those variables for example whereas culley et al 2016 focused on annual average rainfall and temperature in their case study on lake como flood management and irrigation requirements it is likely that a thorough exploration of system vulnerability for this alpine lake would require exploration of attributes that affect features such as snow pack and snow melt rates evaporation from the reservoir and evapotranspiration from the irrigation demand regions these attributes could include winter precipitation amounts the number of frost days in the year growing season length and so on stress testing the system to each individual change and all the possible combinations of those changes poses substantial numerical and computational barriers to the inversion problem for example the required runtimes indicated by guo et al 2018 for a simple application of three attributes e g 8 h for producing 100 simulated weather time series using 8 cores suggest significant potential challenges for the widespread application of the inverse generation method and requires a structured approach for identifying opportunities for computational efficiencies consequently there is a need to reduce the run times of the optimization loop that underpins the inversion process so that it can be applied to more complex systems within practical timeframes a further challenge is that as the number of attributes to be perturbed increases the likelihood of attempting to simulate infeasible changes will also increase for example consider the relationship between the attributes average annual rainfall average rainfall intensity and average number of wet days given any two values of those attributes are held constant there is only one value the third can take and it is not numerically possible to simulate time series with further increases or decreases to that third attribute this is particularly important when seeking to generate weather time series that capture specific changes while seeking to match historical climate patterns in all other aspects to maintain physical realism consequently there is a need to manage which attributes of a time series simulated as part of the inversion process achieve the requested change in the event the requested change is infeasible the overarching objective of this paper is therefore to formalize the inversion problem by focusing on two specific aims 1 improving the computational efficiency of the optimization process and 2 ensuring the physical realism of the simulated time series the remainder of the paper proceeds as follows section 2 formally articulates the aims and details general approaches to meet them section 3 describes the case study of adelaide australia followed by sections 4 and 5 that focus on the first and second aims respectively where the general approach is implemented for the case study and is then tested to examine the impact of formalizing the inverse approach as presented in this paper conclusions are presented in section 6 2 formalizing the inverse approach to stochastic generation 2 1 overview of the inverse approach guo et al 2018 presented the inverse approach as a technique to generate hydrometeorological time series that satisfy a set of target changes in specified climate attributes in this context attributes are defined as statistics of particular hydrometeorological variables such as the mean annual rainfall or number of wet days the approach starts by setting targets t j r n where n is the number of attributes considered and j 1 m represents the number of target values of those attributes the target changes may be represented as absolute values e g simulating a time series with annual average rainfall of 960 mm or alternatively they may be represented in terms of the percentage or absolute changes in attributes relative to historical climate e g a 10 decrease in annual average rainfall or 3 c increase in average annual temperature the weather time series can be generated by changing only a single attribute at a time or by simulating combinations of changes for example guo et al 2018 simulated changes in two attributes over a regular grid once the attribute targets are identified the next step is to apply a formal optimization approach that involves modifying the parameter vector θ of some stochastic generator g θ that minimizes a measure between the relevant attributes a j r n of the simulated weather time series and the target attributes t j this is illustrated in fig 1 whereby the target attributes are represented here in two dimensions n 2 over a regular 7 7 grid i e j 1 49 in terms of a fraction or percentage change relative to a historical baseline for each target the inverse approach then adjusts parameter vector θ in order to achieve weather time series with desired attributes this process is also represented mathematically as 1 weather t s j g arg min θ o a j t j where o a j t j describes a general measure of the difference between each weather attribute and its target for example in the case of guo et al 2018 a simple euclidean distance measure was used 2 o a j t j i 1 n a i j t i j 2 it is noted that the process of achieving the weather time series as described in eq 1 is inherently iterative namely the attributes a are calculated from the weather time series in the previous optimization step until a stopping criterion is reached although conceptually straightforward there are two key challenges with the approach 1 how to design an efficient optimization process that extends the inverse approach to high dimensional spaces with high levels of accuracy and minimal runtimes section 2 2 in particular computational issues were identified by guo et al 2018 as a significant challenge and in its current form is likely to inhibit wider application of the inverse methodology 2 how to ensure the realism of the weather time series section 2 3 a feature of the inverse approach is that any desired properties of the climate time series need to be included in the objective function this provides an incentive to include a greater number of attributes in the objective function to maintain realism increasing problem complexity and the likelihood that an infeasible combination of attributes will be requested a traditional euclidean distance objective function does not provide a sufficiently robust approach for prioritizing some attributes above others which is necessary when not all target changes can be met the following sections explore these two challenges in more detail 2 2 improving the computational efficiency of the optimization process the generic steps in the optimization loop that underpins the inverse approach are shown in fig 2 which consists of an iterative process for updating the parameters of a weather generator θ k until certain stopping criteria have been met the approach to updating depends on the specific choice of optimization method e g gradient descent versus stochastic searches but all methods aim to improve the objective function value o a j t j which for this case consists of a measure of distance between the generated weather time series attributes and the target attributes potential stopping criteria for the optimization loop include the completion of a fixed number of iterations stagnation in the optimization process or sufficiently small errors between the attribute values of the time series generated from the weather generator and the target attributes zielinski et al 2005 the following two approaches can be used to improve the computational efficiency of the above processes i selecting the optimization algorithm that is most suited to the characteristics of the optimization problem and ii reducing the size of the search space as much as possible without restricting the ability to identify the desired solutions for the first approach it is necessary to diagnose the nature of the optimization fitness landscape the relationship between the decision variables and the objective function as this is critical for identifying the most efficient optimization algorithm for the class of problem to be tackled maier et al 2019 for example smooth fitness landscapes may enable computationally efficient hill climbing algorithms to find the global optimum e g nesterov 2007 whereas irregular fitness landscapes require stochastic methods kingston et al 2008 in low dimensional problems an enumeration methodology can be used to visualize the fitness landscape and examine its properties directly whereas for higher dimensional problems the use of fitness landscape statistics that identify properties like the overall structure of the fitness landscape any flat areas of the same function value and the distance between good local optima and the global solution might be required gibbs et al 2011 gibbs et al 2015 maier et al 2014 malan and engelbrecht 2013 given that the fitness landscape is defined by the weather generators and attributes of interest the most suitable optimization algorithm is likely to depend on the specific implementation of the inverse approach a challenge for the second approach is that for all but the simplest problems it is generally not possible to know a priori how the stochastic generation parameter vector θ maps into the attribute space fig 1 this makes it difficult to provide bounds on the weather generator parameters which are necessary for some optimization algorithms such that the bounds do not unintentionally prevent some requested time series from being generated in order to address this issue guo et al 2018 used very wide bounds on the weather generator parameters during the optimization process however this approach produces very large search spaces which can result in significant increases in the computational effort associated with identifying the desired parameter values an alternative approach used in this study is to refine the bounds of the weather generator parameters by assessing typical ranges of stochastic weather generator parameters applied to a broad set of current weather time series across a large geographic area under the assumption that there are likely to be current weather analogues e g weather time series in very warm and arid regions that are representative of plausible future changes as a result of anthropogenic climate change 2 3 ensuring the physical realism of the simulated time series the weather time series to be generated using the inverse approach are synthetic series and are thus not constrained by physical processes in the same manner as time series generated by weather and climate models for example if a target is to increase total annual rainfall by 15 then it would be theoretically possible for the weather generator to produce time series whereby all the annual rainfall occurs within one season or occurs uniformly across a whole year or any other possible series that meets the total annual rainfall target the proposed conceptual approach for addressing this issue and ensuring physical realism is to generate time series that represent the proposed target changes but with all other aspects of the weather time series held at historical values this is achieved by including a larger number of target attributes within the optimization process by focusing on both perturbed attributes that represent the primary objective of the optimization and held attributes that keep all other aspects of the weather time series as close to their historical values as possible this substantially increases the complexity of the optimization problem by increasing the number of attributes n that need to be considered as part of eq 1 further highlighting the importance of reducing the size of the search space through other means as discussed in section 2 2 beyond the computational challenges associated with this increase in optimization complexity there is a more fundamental problem in many cases setting a large number of both perturbed and held attributes will lead to requests for infeasible attribute combinations returning to the example of increasing annual average rainfall by 15 we might seek to achieve this while holding the number of wet days the amount per wet day and any other aspects of the annual rainfall time series at their historical values however this combination is not possible increasing annual rainfall can only be achieved through either increasing the number of wet days or the amount of rainfall per wet day or some combination of the two the nature of the over constrained optimization problem is illustrated in fig 3 where we plot the feasible subspace of total annual rainfall number of wet days and amounts per wet day in the three dimensional space of possible attribute changes this subspace is calculated assuming the total annual rainfall is the product of the number of wet days and the average wet day amount a ann total rainfall a no wet days a wet day amounts as an example we seek to increase total annual rainfall the perturbed attribute by 15 from its historical value leading from point 1 which represents the historical conditions to point 2 which if the two other attributes are held at their historical values is an infeasible target i e point 2 does not lie within the feasible subspace if a euclidean distance objective function eq 2 is used in the optimization process see fig 2 the solution indicated by point 3 will be identified point 3 is the solution closest to the target that lies on the feasible subspace i e point 3 is the orthogonal projection of point 2 onto the feasible subspace however this solution only increases the total annual rainfall by 10 and thus does not produce rainfall time series with the desired 15 change it also leads to a 5 increase in the number of wet days and amounts per wet day an alternative solution is to modify the objective function to place more emphasis on the perturbed attribute and in so doing find a solution that produces the desired change in the perturbed attribute but keeps the remaining held attributes as close as possible to historical values in this simple illustration this might lead to total annual rainfall increasing by 15 as originally sought by both increasing the number of wet days and amounts per wet day each by 7 see point 4 as the objective function is used to measure how close the attributes of the simulated time series are to the intended targets this also needs to manage any trade offs between attributes this suggests the use of penalties coello coello 2002 to modify the objective function to favor solutions with smaller errors in perturbed attributes here the modification of the objective function eq 2 is discussed with reference to two general penalty structures a linear penalty structure that adds a linear term based on the error in the perturbed attributes eq 3 and a quadratic structure that adds a squared term based on the error in the perturbed attributes eq 4 note that this equation can be rearranged as a weighted sum the two modified objective functions are given by 3 o a j t j i 1 n t i j a i j 2 k 1 p λ k abs t k j a k j 4 o a j t j i 1 n t i j a i j 2 k 1 p λ k 1 t k j a k j 2 where k 1 p represents the subset of n perturbed attributes i e p n λ are the scaling parameters applied to the errors in the perturbed attributes the remaining notation is consistent with eq 2 eqs 3 and 4 reduce to the unweighted euclidean distance objective function eq 2 for λ k 0 and 1 respectively the effect of these penalties and scaling parameter values can be illustrated with a continuation of the example in fig 3 where we seek to increase total annual rainfall by 15 and hold the number of wet days and amounts per wet day at historical values here instead of viewing the three dimensional space of possible attribute changes a two dimensional slice through the space is shown in fig 4 such that each panel displays the feasible solution subspace as a black line this slice was represented by the dashed line in fig 3 the over constrained target is represented by a red point and the contours represent the objective function value for each attribute combination in the 2d space i e the fitness landscape the minimum error solution represented by the blue point occurs where the smallest objective function value i e 2d fitness landscape intersects the feasible subspace black line to demonstrate how the fitness landscape and minimum error solution change with different penalty structures and scaling parameters λ fig 4 compares different λ values for both a linear penalty structure top panels and a quadratic penalty structure bottom panels moving left to right the panels in fig 4 illustrate the effect of increasing the scaling parameter λ on the perturbed attribute annual total rainfall in terms of the change in the fitness landscape and thus the location of the minimum error solution blue point for the two penalty structures for the case where all attributes are equally weighted within the objective function left most panels of fig 4 the fitness landscape contours are circular and the identified minimum error solution increases the perturbed attribute by approximately 10 as the scaling parameter λ is increased the minimum error solution is moved along the feasible subspace line towards the solution with zero error in the perturbed attribute the rate at which the minimum error solution moves along the feasible line with change in a scaling parameter λ is dependent on the penalty structure the linear penalty term top panels has the capacity to identify a solution with zero error in the perturbed attribute if the scaling parameter is sufficiently large in contrast the quadratic penalty term bottom panels exhibits asymptotic behaviour such that as the scaling parameter increases the minimum error solution will get closer to the zero error solution in the perturbed attribute but will never intersect it the choice of penalty is influenced by the problem application for example where it is important to meet the perturbed attribute target the linear penalty term may be appropriate however if the held attributes also have a substantial impact on system performance the quadratic penalty may be more appropriate it is noted that the illustrative example described in figs 3 and 4 is highly conceptual and most widely used weather generators have much greater complexity to enable them to simulate the statistical features of realistic weather time series the capacity to achieve specified target attribute combinations will be limited both by physical constraints as illustrated in figs 3 and 4 and the ability of the weather generator to simulate the requisite combinations for example an annual markov model would not be capable of simulating seasonal variability in various rainfall statistics thereby leading to infeasible targets if the objective is to simulate seasonal variability conversely overly complex weather generators would lead to a much higher dimensional parameter set θ as well as the need to constrain a larger number of attributes to ensure physical realism of the generated series placing more burden on the optimization process care is therefore needed to ensure that a weather generator of appropriate complexity is selected to achieve the objectives of each investigation 3 case study the issues and proposed solutions highlighted in the previous section are illustrated using rainfall data from a location in adelaide australia the region has a mediterranean climate with an annual average rainfall of 532 mm the rainfall for this region is highly seasonal with most rainfall occurring during winter june july and august and spring september october and november and the least rainfall occurring in the summer season december january and february historical rainfall time series for adelaide 34 92 s 138 62 e were obtained from the australian water availability project awap dataset raupach et al 2012 to minimise the influence of changing trends in rainfall the period 1970 1999 was selected since this period is relatively stationary two stochastic daily weather generators are used in this study that follow the precipitation component of wgen i a simple four parameter model to aid in theoretical understanding of the optimization fitness landscape and ii a more complex model to investigate how well the proposed developments work for more realistic applications richardson and wright 1984 the simple weather generator model used has only four parameters two parameters control the wet dry sequence throughout the time series using a 1st order markov chain pdd is the probability of a dry day given a dry day occurred previously and pwd is the probability of a dry day given a wet day occurred previously for any two values of these parameters the supplementary parameters pdw and pww are calculated and sequences of wet and dry days for the length of the time series are obtained using a random number generator the remaining two parameters control the amount of rainfall that occurs on wet days these are the shape and rate parameters of the gamma distribution α and β from which each wet day rainfall amount is randomly sampled given the parameters do not vary throughout the year this weather generator can only produce stochastic rainfall time series to meet a range of climate attributes measured at an annual level it is therefore referred to throughout as the annual weather generator to perturb intra annual attributes a more complex weather generator is needed with additional parameters and hence greater degrees of freedom to produce the required time series the method used in this study is to extend the parameters of the simple model where each of the original four parameters is specified as varying throughout the year a harmonic model is used to control this variation dictated by the mean amplitude and phase angle of a harmonic e g pdd becomes pdd m pdd amp and pdd phase richardson 1981 this is the same approach richardson 1981 used to create temperature and solar radiation time series however in this application the harmonic model is not creating the time series directly but describing what values the parameters should take the harmonic models are fixed to have 12 periods allowing for each of the four annual wgen parameters to take different monthly values throughout each year this allows the perturbation of attributes at the seasonal level and this model is referred to throughout as the seasonal weather generator only eight parameters are used as decision variables for this seasonal weather generator as the phase angle parameters are fixed at historical values leaving just the mean and amplitude for pdd pwd α and β the calibration process outlined by richardson 1981 was used to determine the values of the four phase angle parameters for the case study site of adelaide the pdd pwd α and β phase angles were 0 355 0 232 3 53 and 2 46 respectively this modification to the seasonal weather generator maintains the seasonal pattern in the generated time series such that most rainfall occurs in winter and spring but still allows for the actual rainfall volume in each season to be perturbed separately the trade off with this new model is the large increase in computational effort required to find a solution given the increased search space the attribute sets used in the implementation of the inverse approach are listed in table 1 for each weather generator type throughout this paper ptot is selected as the perturbed attribute given its common usage in scenario neutral impact studies except in two instances designed to investigate applications for multiple perturbed attributes where nwet is also selected the remaining held attributes are included in the objective function for each simulation to ensure that these properties are maintained in the perturbed time series as discussed in section 2 3 given the change in model complexity different sets of attributes are specified for each weather generator the seasonal model requires more held attributes given the extra degrees of freedom provided by the parameters 4 investigation into the impact of increasing the efficiency of optimization the following section contains a specific implementation of the approach for increasing the efficiency of the optimization process proposed in section 2 2 the optimization problem is analyzed for the case study leading to the selection of an optimization algorithm that is suited to the fitness landscape section 4 1 the optimization process is then implemented on the case study with improvements to optimization efficiency due to restricting the bounds of the weather generator parameters section 4 2 4 1 selecting a suitable optimization algorithm in order to determine the most appropriate optimization algorithm for the case study application the nature of the fitness landscape is analyzed this is done for the annual weather generator as this enables an enumeration method to be used to generate the landscape as a fitness landscape for a model with four parameters is five dimensional with the fifth dimension being the objective function value i e the fitness the complete fitness landscape is unable to be visualized consequently in order to enable key aspects of the overall fitness landscape to be inspected separate three dimensional fitness landscapes are generated for the shape and rate parameters α and β respectively and the probability of wet dry and dry dry parameters the required fitness values are calculated using the unweighted objective function eq 2 for three attributes all held at historical levels ptot nwet and p99 as part of this process the random seed used in the weather generator is held constant to maintain a set relationship between parameters and attribute values guo et al 2018 the resulting fitness landscapes are shown in fig 5 as can be seen the fitness landscape in the left panel is smooth as the gamma function from which rainfall amounts are sampled is continuous so that changes to the gamma distribution parameters result directly in changes in rainfall volume as a fixed random seed was used to eliminate stochastic noise as mentioned above in contrast the fitness landscape on the right is rough with many local optima this is due to discrete changes in the response surface as a result of changing the number of wet and dry days based on this finding it is likely that irregular response surfaces will be a feature of markov based weather generators including the higher dimensional seasonal model also used in this paper suggesting that there is no need to perform fitness landscape analysis for the more complex model the diagnosis therefore suggests that stochastic search algorithms should be used for implementing the inverse approach as hill climbing methods are likely to get stuck in local optima and thus fail to find the best possible solution there is a wide range of stochastic search algorithms that could be used for response surfaces such as that illustrated in fig 5 including shuffled complex evolution ant colony optimization and genetic algorithms dorigo et al 1996 duan et al 1993 holland 1992 in this study a genetic algorithm is used scrucca 2013 as this algorithm has been found to be effective in optimizing single objective functions with rough fitness landscapes the parameter values for each operator of the genetic algorithm used are provided in table 2 a population and number of generations of 200 were chosen to ensure solutions converged and the remaining parameters were recommended by scrucca 2013 4 2 reducing the optimization search space in order to determine appropriate bounds for the parameters of the weather generators for the case study location in adelaide both weather generators were calibrated to 2870 awap grid locations spanning all climatic regions of australia at a 50 km resolution using the approach set out in richardson 1981 given the significant variability in rainfall time series across continental australia which spans tropical temperate alpine mediterranean semi arid and arid climates this approach is likely to provide a reasonable proxy of the range of variability anticipated for the case study location as a result of future climate change the actual domain knowledge informed parameter bounds were taken as the 0 3th and 99 7th percentile of the values of the 2870 rainfall time series and are summarized in tables 3 and 4 to enable the benefits of reducing the size of the search space to be assessed the inverse approach was used to generate time series with the set of attributes shown in table 1 for this test all attributes were set at a target of their historical levels i e they were all held attributes both weather generators were used for time series generation each with the domain knowledge informed parameters bounds and the wider uniformed bounds used by guo et al 2018 see tables 3 and 4 for the annual weather generator the use of domain knowledge informed bounds was able to reduce the volume of the search space by seven orders of magnitude whereas for the seasonal generator the volume was reduced by fifteen orders of magnitude all optimization runs were repeated 50 times from different random starting positions in the solution space to minimize the influence of the random search behavior of the genetic algorithm in contrast the weather generator seed was held constant for all simulations to ensure consistency in the fitness landscape as mentioned previously fig 6 compares the reduction in objective function value at each optimization generation when domain knowledge informed bounds and uninformed bounds are used to restrict the parameter values for the annual weather generator left panel and the seasonal weather generator right panel for the annual weather generator the optimization with informed parameter bounds converges much more quickly and finds better solutions i e three orders of magnitudes smaller than the optimization with the uniformed bounds for the computational budget of 200 generations the objective function error for the informed bounds experiment at generation 200 was 0 09 compared to 130 for the uninformed bounds experiment left panel fig 6 the benefits of using parameter informed bounds is more pronounced for the seasonal weather generator right panel such that at generation 200 the objective function errors are approximately five orders of magnitude larger when uninformed parameter bounds are used 56 212 compared to 0 202 for the informed bounds this highlights the potential benefits of search space size reduction by using domain knowledge informed parameters in terms of increasing the computational efficiency of the inverse approach and hence increasing the chances of finding better solutions especially for higher dimensional search spaces such as those associated with more complex weather generators 5 ensuring the realism of hydrometeorological time series to ensure realistic time series are generated by the inverse approach the penalty structures presented in section 2 3 are applied to the adelaide case study section 5 1 tests how penalty functions work when creating targeted time series in different regions of a scenario neutral space the simple annual weather generator and the linear penalty function eq 3 are used for this demonstration section 5 2 then compares the effect of the two penalty function structures using the more complex seasonal weather generator how well penalty functions can be used to focus on two perturbed attributes at once is investigated in section 5 3 these results are specific to the weather generators attributes and target time series used in this case study consequently the process of examining how the results change with different penalty scaling parameters is something that should be repeated for each implementation of the inverse approach to ensure the time series are created with the most appropriate trade offs across the perturbed and held attributes 5 1 focusing on an attribute with two target perturbations in order to determine how penalty functions perform in creating time series in different regions of a scenario neutral space two target time series are generated using the simple annual weather generator and a linear penalty term eq 3 the perturbed attribute in both cases is ptot with the first target having no change in all selected attributes from historical levels table 1 and the second target having a 30 decrease in the total annual rainfall volume ptot with no change in other attributes fig 7 shows the distance from the target of each attribute as a percentage error across 50 optimisation seeds for varying λ values for both targets the λ 0 cases show the error breakdown across the selected attributes using an unweighted objective function i e equivalent to eq 2 for the historical target when λ 0 the error is low and spread relatively evenly across each attribute top panel the error in this context arises because of structural deficiencies in the simple annual weather generator relative to the complex historical rainfall time series so that the weather generator is not able to faithfully simulate all the historical values of the perturbed and held attributes for the second target a 30 decrease in ptot the error is much more varied across attributes and the ptot attribute has 20 error whereas the other attributes have less than 10 error bottom panel this again results from a lack of flexibility in the annual weather generator it lacks the degrees of freedom to change ptot alone to reduce the error in the attribute ptot its weight in the objective function needs to be increased this trade off in the error between the perturbed and the held attributes changes with increasing scaling parameter values λ fig 7 once λ 2 the error in ptot is approximately zero however the error in three held attributes nwet p90 and p99 has increased the average dry spell duration dsd is the only attribute that does not increase its error as it only depends on the wet dry first order markov chain in contrast the error in the number of wet days increases which is likely because this attribute more directly affects the number of high rain days sampled in a year the above results demonstrate that the selection of λ can be used to manage the trade off in error between ptot and the held attributes the decision as to which value of λ is most appropriate should be made on a case by case basis by considering the importance of errors in the held attributes relative to errors in the perturbed attributes note that the results indicate some targets require higher penalty scaling parameter values during optimization to make time series with zero error in the perturbed attribute 5 2 comparing two penalty function structures in order to examine the differences between the two penalty structures proposed in section 2 3 both penalty structures eqs 3 and 4 are used to create the same target time series the requested target time series corresponds to a 30 increase in ptot which is the perturbed attribute with all other attributes held constant the target time series are created using the seasonal weather generator for the desired attributes table 1 to see how the penalties perform with more attributes in the objective function fig 8 shows the breakdown of errors across each attribute for the linear penalty term top and the quadratic penalty bottom the trialed scaling parameter values differ between the investigated penalties the linear penalty scaling parameter was varied from 0 to 4 and the quadratic penalty scaling parameter was varied from 5 to 25 as can be seen from fig 8 top panel the linear penalty term performs in a similar manner to when it was used with the annual generator fig 7 bottom panel despite the addition of two attributes one difference is that the error in the nwet attribute is higher for the seasonal weather generator it should be noted that this distribution of error is a property of three separate elements of the optimization problem the attributes chosen the target set and the weather generator used with more attributes in the objective function attributes like nwet that had high error for the annual generator are now weighted relatively less and thus have higher error when the seasonal generator is used however despite the changes in error a value of λ 2 is still enough to satisfy the perturbed attribute target for the quadratic penalty term the error in the perturbed attribute does not reach zero instead it approaches zero as the scaling parameter increases like in the example case shown in fig 4 section 2 3 note that larger scaling parameter values are used to reduce the error in the perturbed attribute because the square root of the scaling parameter is taken in eq 4 fig 8 bottom panel as a result there is less overall error in the simulated time series when averaged across the perturbed and held attributes this is best demonstrated by examining the nwet attribute in the top and bottom panels of fig 8 as the scaling parameter increases the error in this attribute is around 5 less for the quadratic penalty term than it is with the linear penalty term even though the perturbed attribute has near zero error the decision behind which penalty structure to use in applications of the inverse approach should be made by considering the importance of error in the attributes for example if a target time series is set with the primary intention of reaching zero error in ptot and the other attributes are selected to make sure the stochastic time series stay similar to historical conditions then the linear term penalty with high λ value could be used however if the ptot target does not need to be precisely simulated and the other attributes have a strong bearing on system performance the time series found using the quadratic penalty term might be more appropriate for analysis as a result for potential future applications it is likely that a process of trial and error would be needed to obtain an appropriate compromise in the trade off in errors between attributes and thus the penalty function and associated value of λ 5 3 focusing on two perturbed attributes in order to determine if objective function penalties can be used to guide the error for multiple attributes time series are created with two perturbed attributes in addition to ptot these time series will be created with the number of wet days in the year nwet as a penalized attribute fig 9 shows the error breakdown for each attribute for the requested target of historical conditions using two perturbed attributes and varying the λ values for the linear penalty term eq 3 here both ptot and nwet are selected as perturbed attributes figs 7 and 8 as previous results demonstrated the difficulty in achieving low error in both ptot and nwet simultaneously fig 9 demonstrates that the seasonal weather generator can achieve near zero error in both perturbed attributes given two appropriate penalty scaling parameters this is first seen when λ ptot 1 and λ nwet 2 in this case the penalty terms are enough to make the error in the five held attributes higher than they would be with only ptot penalized as in previous cases their error stayed low while nwet increased further these results show that the nwet attribute should be weighted twice as much as the ptot attribute for both to achieve near zero error from their target again this ratio will be a property of the weather generator and requested targets to summarise the impact of penalty functions we compare the difference in the creation of a 4x4 regular grid scenario neutral space 16 target time series using the unweighted objective function eq 2 and the objective function with a linear penalty term eq 3 with λ ptot 3 and λ nwet 3 to ensure each target is met the requested scenario neutral space varies ptot and nwet from 70 to 130 of their historical values all other targets are held at historical conditions fig 10 compares the performance of the two optimization outcomes when the unweighted objective function is over constrained the two perturbed attributes cannot meet their targets left panel fig 10 this was also demonstrated in section 5 2 where the error was spread across seven attributes when λ 0 fig 8 top panel in fig 10 this is seen as a clustering in the simulated targets for the ptot dimension in particular the simulated targets are more varied in simulating nwet achieving a 30 decrease but struggling to meet a 30 increase this is due to the weather generator structure where the number of wet days can be decreased with minimal impact on the rainfall volume extremes or seasonality as the wet dry sequence is changed independently in contrast the use of penalties in the objective function enables the generation of time series with attributes that match two target perturbed attributes for the majority of the scenario neutral space right panel fig 10 however this comes at the cost of increasing the error in the remaining held attributes as can be seen from the mean held attribute error shown below each target in fig 10 taking the example of the top right target circled in red when the unweighted objective function is used the held attributes are within 10 of historical levels on average however both perturbed attributes are 15 away from their targets in order for both perturbed attributes to reach their target the error in the held attributes increases by a further 9 on average given the purpose of the held attributes is usually to ensure the realism of the time series prioritization towards the perturbed attributes at the expense of the held attributes in most cases will be desirable 6 conclusions the effectiveness of scenario neutral approaches hinges on the ability to stress test systems against plausible realizations of future climate however the range of changes in climate that can be examined is limited by the methods used to create the perturbed time series recently the inverse approach has been presented as a method capable of producing perturbations to complex measures of hydrometeorological variables by using formal optimization techniques with stochastic weather generators conceptually this method can be applied to generate weather time series that represent not only changes in the averages but also changes in the variability intermittency extremes seasonality and or inter annual persistence however there are two key challenges to implementing the method the large computational effort required to create the perturbed stochastic time series and the difficulty in ensuring the realism of the time series this paper presents approaches to overcome these challenges and improve the effectiveness of the inverse approach specific implementations were demonstrated using the case study of adelaide australia with a simple annual weather generator and a more complex seasonal weather generator as methods to increase the efficiency of an optimization process can be algorithm specific a first step is to diagnose the nature of the optimization problem for the weather generators used in the case study the optimization fitness landscape was found to be irregular due to the first order markov chain used to sequence wet and dry days as a result a genetic algorithm was selected and two sets of bounds on the decision variables were compared one set of uninformed bounds and one set based on the parameter values obtained when calibrating the weather generators to sites around australia results demonstrated that the domain knowledge informed bounds increased the convergence of the optimization process by a significant amount and led to a reduction in fitness values by two orders of magnitude for the seasonal weather generator this indicates that using domain knowledge of the weather generator parameters when employing the inverse approach can increase the efficiency of the approach particularly with more complex weather generators the proposed approach for ensuring the realism of generated time series is to include attributes in the objective function that keep all properties of the time series near historical levels other than those that are being actively perturbed this has the side effect of both making the problem more complex and creating infeasible target requests e g increasing the total rainfall in the year without changing either the number of wet days or the average amount per day the recommended solution is to add penalties to the objective function that prioritize meeting the perturbed attribute targets while ensuring that the remaining attributes are held as close to their historical values as possible two penalty function structures were explored on multiple target perturbations for various values of the penalty scaling parameter when compared to an unweighted objective function results show that the use of penalties is beneficial for creating realistic hydrometeorological time series for use in scenario neutral spaces currently the optimization approach is formulated to create step changes in climate attributes as these time series are required for scenario neutral spaces further work is required to extend this optimization formulation to creating transient time series for use in other scenario neutral impact assessments that do not generate scenario neutral spaces both these advances to the inverse approach allow for a greater range of perturbations to be made to historical climate records this enables the stress testing of systems against a broader range of climate attributes and crucially identifying system vulnerabilities in response to this change this ultimately will help ensure scenario neutral analyses are able to identify system responses and potential failure modes to a much

6281,scenario neutral approaches are used increasingly as a means of stress testing climate sensitive systems to a range of plausible future climate conditions to ensure that these stress tests are able to explore system vulnerability it is necessary to generate hydrometeorological time series that represent all aspects of plausible future change e g averages seasonality extremes a promising approach to generating these time series is by inverting the stochastic weather generation problem to obtain weather time series that capture all the relevant statistical features of plausible future change the objective of this paper is to formalize this inverse approach to weather generation by both characterizing the process of optimizing weather generator parameters and proposing a numerically efficient solution that exploits prior knowledge and accounts for the complexity of the optimization landscape the proposed approach also provides a structured way to ensure the physical realism of the generated weather time series by using penalty based objective functions to focus the optimization on the climate features deemed most relevant to the system being analyzed a case study in adelaide australia is used to demonstrate specific implementations of this approach the use of bounds on the weather generators dramatically decreases the time taken to create time series and the use of penalties is shown to allow for change in some statistics to be prioritized while still ensuring the realism of the time series keywords scenario neutral stochastic weather generation bottom up inverse approach climate change impact assessment realistic perturbed hydrometeorological time series 1 introduction scenario neutral climate impact assessments are proving to be an effective way of assessing how a range of climate sensitive systems might respond to plausible future climate changes the scenario neutral approach has been applied recently to flood protection water supply and ecological systems culley et al 2016 poff et al 2016 prudhomme et al 2013 with these studies demonstrating that scenario neutral approaches both lead to important insights into overall system sensitivities and vulnerabilities and enable the identification of possible failure modes by determining how a system responds to step changes in climate prudhomme et al 2010 these approaches are also increasingly being used to provide decision theoretic information describing conditions whereby one system configuration or design option is preferred to another brown et al 2012 or approximating the maximum operational adaptive capacity of the system culley et al 2016 although most scenario neutral approaches have focused on changes in the mean state of climate variables culley et al 2016 prudhomme et al 2013 prudhomme et al 2010 spence and brown 2018 wilcke and bärring 2016 it is becoming increasingly apparent that critical system vulnerabilities may reside in other aspects of change including variability intermittency extremes seasonality and or inter annual persistence bussi et al 2016 guo et al 2017 steinschneider and brown 2013 an important implication is that if key sensitives are not identified major modes of system vulnerability may not be uncovered thereby negating the stated benefit of scenario neutral studies this poses a deep challenge to the viability of scenario neutral approaches how should weather and hydrometeorological time series be generated to capture all possible aspects of future change the primary approach currently available to address this challenge within the scenario neutral framework is through the use of stochastic weather generators which contain sufficient flexibility to simulate a wide variety of possible future changes while maintaining the statistical features commonly associated with weather time series guo et al 2018 steinschneider and brown 2013 the forward scaling approach presented by steinschneider and brown 2013 is capable of manipulating more complex measurements of precipitation like persistence by directly perturbing the parameters of a weather generator to generate baseline time series with different statistics however to produce the uniform perturbations to climate attributes required in a scenario neutral assessment this still requires some post processing of time series such as quantile mapping to represent targeted changes in climate given scaling methods are still used the range of attributes that can be perturbed is often limited to means and seasonality by directly adjusting the baseline time series to avoid the scaling process guo et al 2018 provided the first structured attempt at inverting the stochastic generation problem by varying the parameters of a stochastic generator through an optimization loop to simulate weather time series with pre specified statistics or attributes the generation of time series using this approach was demonstrated for three climate variables precipitation temperature and evapotranspiration guo et al 2017 and was benchmarked on a rainfall dataset from a catchment in south australia guo et al 2018 as scenario neutral approaches are applied to increasingly complex systems it becomes necessary to explore increasing numbers of hydrometeorological variables and statistics of those variables for example whereas culley et al 2016 focused on annual average rainfall and temperature in their case study on lake como flood management and irrigation requirements it is likely that a thorough exploration of system vulnerability for this alpine lake would require exploration of attributes that affect features such as snow pack and snow melt rates evaporation from the reservoir and evapotranspiration from the irrigation demand regions these attributes could include winter precipitation amounts the number of frost days in the year growing season length and so on stress testing the system to each individual change and all the possible combinations of those changes poses substantial numerical and computational barriers to the inversion problem for example the required runtimes indicated by guo et al 2018 for a simple application of three attributes e g 8 h for producing 100 simulated weather time series using 8 cores suggest significant potential challenges for the widespread application of the inverse generation method and requires a structured approach for identifying opportunities for computational efficiencies consequently there is a need to reduce the run times of the optimization loop that underpins the inversion process so that it can be applied to more complex systems within practical timeframes a further challenge is that as the number of attributes to be perturbed increases the likelihood of attempting to simulate infeasible changes will also increase for example consider the relationship between the attributes average annual rainfall average rainfall intensity and average number of wet days given any two values of those attributes are held constant there is only one value the third can take and it is not numerically possible to simulate time series with further increases or decreases to that third attribute this is particularly important when seeking to generate weather time series that capture specific changes while seeking to match historical climate patterns in all other aspects to maintain physical realism consequently there is a need to manage which attributes of a time series simulated as part of the inversion process achieve the requested change in the event the requested change is infeasible the overarching objective of this paper is therefore to formalize the inversion problem by focusing on two specific aims 1 improving the computational efficiency of the optimization process and 2 ensuring the physical realism of the simulated time series the remainder of the paper proceeds as follows section 2 formally articulates the aims and details general approaches to meet them section 3 describes the case study of adelaide australia followed by sections 4 and 5 that focus on the first and second aims respectively where the general approach is implemented for the case study and is then tested to examine the impact of formalizing the inverse approach as presented in this paper conclusions are presented in section 6 2 formalizing the inverse approach to stochastic generation 2 1 overview of the inverse approach guo et al 2018 presented the inverse approach as a technique to generate hydrometeorological time series that satisfy a set of target changes in specified climate attributes in this context attributes are defined as statistics of particular hydrometeorological variables such as the mean annual rainfall or number of wet days the approach starts by setting targets t j r n where n is the number of attributes considered and j 1 m represents the number of target values of those attributes the target changes may be represented as absolute values e g simulating a time series with annual average rainfall of 960 mm or alternatively they may be represented in terms of the percentage or absolute changes in attributes relative to historical climate e g a 10 decrease in annual average rainfall or 3 c increase in average annual temperature the weather time series can be generated by changing only a single attribute at a time or by simulating combinations of changes for example guo et al 2018 simulated changes in two attributes over a regular grid once the attribute targets are identified the next step is to apply a formal optimization approach that involves modifying the parameter vector θ of some stochastic generator g θ that minimizes a measure between the relevant attributes a j r n of the simulated weather time series and the target attributes t j this is illustrated in fig 1 whereby the target attributes are represented here in two dimensions n 2 over a regular 7 7 grid i e j 1 49 in terms of a fraction or percentage change relative to a historical baseline for each target the inverse approach then adjusts parameter vector θ in order to achieve weather time series with desired attributes this process is also represented mathematically as 1 weather t s j g arg min θ o a j t j where o a j t j describes a general measure of the difference between each weather attribute and its target for example in the case of guo et al 2018 a simple euclidean distance measure was used 2 o a j t j i 1 n a i j t i j 2 it is noted that the process of achieving the weather time series as described in eq 1 is inherently iterative namely the attributes a are calculated from the weather time series in the previous optimization step until a stopping criterion is reached although conceptually straightforward there are two key challenges with the approach 1 how to design an efficient optimization process that extends the inverse approach to high dimensional spaces with high levels of accuracy and minimal runtimes section 2 2 in particular computational issues were identified by guo et al 2018 as a significant challenge and in its current form is likely to inhibit wider application of the inverse methodology 2 how to ensure the realism of the weather time series section 2 3 a feature of the inverse approach is that any desired properties of the climate time series need to be included in the objective function this provides an incentive to include a greater number of attributes in the objective function to maintain realism increasing problem complexity and the likelihood that an infeasible combination of attributes will be requested a traditional euclidean distance objective function does not provide a sufficiently robust approach for prioritizing some attributes above others which is necessary when not all target changes can be met the following sections explore these two challenges in more detail 2 2 improving the computational efficiency of the optimization process the generic steps in the optimization loop that underpins the inverse approach are shown in fig 2 which consists of an iterative process for updating the parameters of a weather generator θ k until certain stopping criteria have been met the approach to updating depends on the specific choice of optimization method e g gradient descent versus stochastic searches but all methods aim to improve the objective function value o a j t j which for this case consists of a measure of distance between the generated weather time series attributes and the target attributes potential stopping criteria for the optimization loop include the completion of a fixed number of iterations stagnation in the optimization process or sufficiently small errors between the attribute values of the time series generated from the weather generator and the target attributes zielinski et al 2005 the following two approaches can be used to improve the computational efficiency of the above processes i selecting the optimization algorithm that is most suited to the characteristics of the optimization problem and ii reducing the size of the search space as much as possible without restricting the ability to identify the desired solutions for the first approach it is necessary to diagnose the nature of the optimization fitness landscape the relationship between the decision variables and the objective function as this is critical for identifying the most efficient optimization algorithm for the class of problem to be tackled maier et al 2019 for example smooth fitness landscapes may enable computationally efficient hill climbing algorithms to find the global optimum e g nesterov 2007 whereas irregular fitness landscapes require stochastic methods kingston et al 2008 in low dimensional problems an enumeration methodology can be used to visualize the fitness landscape and examine its properties directly whereas for higher dimensional problems the use of fitness landscape statistics that identify properties like the overall structure of the fitness landscape any flat areas of the same function value and the distance between good local optima and the global solution might be required gibbs et al 2011 gibbs et al 2015 maier et al 2014 malan and engelbrecht 2013 given that the fitness landscape is defined by the weather generators and attributes of interest the most suitable optimization algorithm is likely to depend on the specific implementation of the inverse approach a challenge for the second approach is that for all but the simplest problems it is generally not possible to know a priori how the stochastic generation parameter vector θ maps into the attribute space fig 1 this makes it difficult to provide bounds on the weather generator parameters which are necessary for some optimization algorithms such that the bounds do not unintentionally prevent some requested time series from being generated in order to address this issue guo et al 2018 used very wide bounds on the weather generator parameters during the optimization process however this approach produces very large search spaces which can result in significant increases in the computational effort associated with identifying the desired parameter values an alternative approach used in this study is to refine the bounds of the weather generator parameters by assessing typical ranges of stochastic weather generator parameters applied to a broad set of current weather time series across a large geographic area under the assumption that there are likely to be current weather analogues e g weather time series in very warm and arid regions that are representative of plausible future changes as a result of anthropogenic climate change 2 3 ensuring the physical realism of the simulated time series the weather time series to be generated using the inverse approach are synthetic series and are thus not constrained by physical processes in the same manner as time series generated by weather and climate models for example if a target is to increase total annual rainfall by 15 then it would be theoretically possible for the weather generator to produce time series whereby all the annual rainfall occurs within one season or occurs uniformly across a whole year or any other possible series that meets the total annual rainfall target the proposed conceptual approach for addressing this issue and ensuring physical realism is to generate time series that represent the proposed target changes but with all other aspects of the weather time series held at historical values this is achieved by including a larger number of target attributes within the optimization process by focusing on both perturbed attributes that represent the primary objective of the optimization and held attributes that keep all other aspects of the weather time series as close to their historical values as possible this substantially increases the complexity of the optimization problem by increasing the number of attributes n that need to be considered as part of eq 1 further highlighting the importance of reducing the size of the search space through other means as discussed in section 2 2 beyond the computational challenges associated with this increase in optimization complexity there is a more fundamental problem in many cases setting a large number of both perturbed and held attributes will lead to requests for infeasible attribute combinations returning to the example of increasing annual average rainfall by 15 we might seek to achieve this while holding the number of wet days the amount per wet day and any other aspects of the annual rainfall time series at their historical values however this combination is not possible increasing annual rainfall can only be achieved through either increasing the number of wet days or the amount of rainfall per wet day or some combination of the two the nature of the over constrained optimization problem is illustrated in fig 3 where we plot the feasible subspace of total annual rainfall number of wet days and amounts per wet day in the three dimensional space of possible attribute changes this subspace is calculated assuming the total annual rainfall is the product of the number of wet days and the average wet day amount a ann total rainfall a no wet days a wet day amounts as an example we seek to increase total annual rainfall the perturbed attribute by 15 from its historical value leading from point 1 which represents the historical conditions to point 2 which if the two other attributes are held at their historical values is an infeasible target i e point 2 does not lie within the feasible subspace if a euclidean distance objective function eq 2 is used in the optimization process see fig 2 the solution indicated by point 3 will be identified point 3 is the solution closest to the target that lies on the feasible subspace i e point 3 is the orthogonal projection of point 2 onto the feasible subspace however this solution only increases the total annual rainfall by 10 and thus does not produce rainfall time series with the desired 15 change it also leads to a 5 increase in the number of wet days and amounts per wet day an alternative solution is to modify the objective function to place more emphasis on the perturbed attribute and in so doing find a solution that produces the desired change in the perturbed attribute but keeps the remaining held attributes as close as possible to historical values in this simple illustration this might lead to total annual rainfall increasing by 15 as originally sought by both increasing the number of wet days and amounts per wet day each by 7 see point 4 as the objective function is used to measure how close the attributes of the simulated time series are to the intended targets this also needs to manage any trade offs between attributes this suggests the use of penalties coello coello 2002 to modify the objective function to favor solutions with smaller errors in perturbed attributes here the modification of the objective function eq 2 is discussed with reference to two general penalty structures a linear penalty structure that adds a linear term based on the error in the perturbed attributes eq 3 and a quadratic structure that adds a squared term based on the error in the perturbed attributes eq 4 note that this equation can be rearranged as a weighted sum the two modified objective functions are given by 3 o a j t j i 1 n t i j a i j 2 k 1 p λ k abs t k j a k j 4 o a j t j i 1 n t i j a i j 2 k 1 p λ k 1 t k j a k j 2 where k 1 p represents the subset of n perturbed attributes i e p n λ are the scaling parameters applied to the errors in the perturbed attributes the remaining notation is consistent with eq 2 eqs 3 and 4 reduce to the unweighted euclidean distance objective function eq 2 for λ k 0 and 1 respectively the effect of these penalties and scaling parameter values can be illustrated with a continuation of the example in fig 3 where we seek to increase total annual rainfall by 15 and hold the number of wet days and amounts per wet day at historical values here instead of viewing the three dimensional space of possible attribute changes a two dimensional slice through the space is shown in fig 4 such that each panel displays the feasible solution subspace as a black line this slice was represented by the dashed line in fig 3 the over constrained target is represented by a red point and the contours represent the objective function value for each attribute combination in the 2d space i e the fitness landscape the minimum error solution represented by the blue point occurs where the smallest objective function value i e 2d fitness landscape intersects the feasible subspace black line to demonstrate how the fitness landscape and minimum error solution change with different penalty structures and scaling parameters λ fig 4 compares different λ values for both a linear penalty structure top panels and a quadratic penalty structure bottom panels moving left to right the panels in fig 4 illustrate the effect of increasing the scaling parameter λ on the perturbed attribute annual total rainfall in terms of the change in the fitness landscape and thus the location of the minimum error solution blue point for the two penalty structures for the case where all attributes are equally weighted within the objective function left most panels of fig 4 the fitness landscape contours are circular and the identified minimum error solution increases the perturbed attribute by approximately 10 as the scaling parameter λ is increased the minimum error solution is moved along the feasible subspace line towards the solution with zero error in the perturbed attribute the rate at which the minimum error solution moves along the feasible line with change in a scaling parameter λ is dependent on the penalty structure the linear penalty term top panels has the capacity to identify a solution with zero error in the perturbed attribute if the scaling parameter is sufficiently large in contrast the quadratic penalty term bottom panels exhibits asymptotic behaviour such that as the scaling parameter increases the minimum error solution will get closer to the zero error solution in the perturbed attribute but will never intersect it the choice of penalty is influenced by the problem application for example where it is important to meet the perturbed attribute target the linear penalty term may be appropriate however if the held attributes also have a substantial impact on system performance the quadratic penalty may be more appropriate it is noted that the illustrative example described in figs 3 and 4 is highly conceptual and most widely used weather generators have much greater complexity to enable them to simulate the statistical features of realistic weather time series the capacity to achieve specified target attribute combinations will be limited both by physical constraints as illustrated in figs 3 and 4 and the ability of the weather generator to simulate the requisite combinations for example an annual markov model would not be capable of simulating seasonal variability in various rainfall statistics thereby leading to infeasible targets if the objective is to simulate seasonal variability conversely overly complex weather generators would lead to a much higher dimensional parameter set θ as well as the need to constrain a larger number of attributes to ensure physical realism of the generated series placing more burden on the optimization process care is therefore needed to ensure that a weather generator of appropriate complexity is selected to achieve the objectives of each investigation 3 case study the issues and proposed solutions highlighted in the previous section are illustrated using rainfall data from a location in adelaide australia the region has a mediterranean climate with an annual average rainfall of 532 mm the rainfall for this region is highly seasonal with most rainfall occurring during winter june july and august and spring september october and november and the least rainfall occurring in the summer season december january and february historical rainfall time series for adelaide 34 92 s 138 62 e were obtained from the australian water availability project awap dataset raupach et al 2012 to minimise the influence of changing trends in rainfall the period 1970 1999 was selected since this period is relatively stationary two stochastic daily weather generators are used in this study that follow the precipitation component of wgen i a simple four parameter model to aid in theoretical understanding of the optimization fitness landscape and ii a more complex model to investigate how well the proposed developments work for more realistic applications richardson and wright 1984 the simple weather generator model used has only four parameters two parameters control the wet dry sequence throughout the time series using a 1st order markov chain pdd is the probability of a dry day given a dry day occurred previously and pwd is the probability of a dry day given a wet day occurred previously for any two values of these parameters the supplementary parameters pdw and pww are calculated and sequences of wet and dry days for the length of the time series are obtained using a random number generator the remaining two parameters control the amount of rainfall that occurs on wet days these are the shape and rate parameters of the gamma distribution α and β from which each wet day rainfall amount is randomly sampled given the parameters do not vary throughout the year this weather generator can only produce stochastic rainfall time series to meet a range of climate attributes measured at an annual level it is therefore referred to throughout as the annual weather generator to perturb intra annual attributes a more complex weather generator is needed with additional parameters and hence greater degrees of freedom to produce the required time series the method used in this study is to extend the parameters of the simple model where each of the original four parameters is specified as varying throughout the year a harmonic model is used to control this variation dictated by the mean amplitude and phase angle of a harmonic e g pdd becomes pdd m pdd amp and pdd phase richardson 1981 this is the same approach richardson 1981 used to create temperature and solar radiation time series however in this application the harmonic model is not creating the time series directly but describing what values the parameters should take the harmonic models are fixed to have 12 periods allowing for each of the four annual wgen parameters to take different monthly values throughout each year this allows the perturbation of attributes at the seasonal level and this model is referred to throughout as the seasonal weather generator only eight parameters are used as decision variables for this seasonal weather generator as the phase angle parameters are fixed at historical values leaving just the mean and amplitude for pdd pwd α and β the calibration process outlined by richardson 1981 was used to determine the values of the four phase angle parameters for the case study site of adelaide the pdd pwd α and β phase angles were 0 355 0 232 3 53 and 2 46 respectively this modification to the seasonal weather generator maintains the seasonal pattern in the generated time series such that most rainfall occurs in winter and spring but still allows for the actual rainfall volume in each season to be perturbed separately the trade off with this new model is the large increase in computational effort required to find a solution given the increased search space the attribute sets used in the implementation of the inverse approach are listed in table 1 for each weather generator type throughout this paper ptot is selected as the perturbed attribute given its common usage in scenario neutral impact studies except in two instances designed to investigate applications for multiple perturbed attributes where nwet is also selected the remaining held attributes are included in the objective function for each simulation to ensure that these properties are maintained in the perturbed time series as discussed in section 2 3 given the change in model complexity different sets of attributes are specified for each weather generator the seasonal model requires more held attributes given the extra degrees of freedom provided by the parameters 4 investigation into the impact of increasing the efficiency of optimization the following section contains a specific implementation of the approach for increasing the efficiency of the optimization process proposed in section 2 2 the optimization problem is analyzed for the case study leading to the selection of an optimization algorithm that is suited to the fitness landscape section 4 1 the optimization process is then implemented on the case study with improvements to optimization efficiency due to restricting the bounds of the weather generator parameters section 4 2 4 1 selecting a suitable optimization algorithm in order to determine the most appropriate optimization algorithm for the case study application the nature of the fitness landscape is analyzed this is done for the annual weather generator as this enables an enumeration method to be used to generate the landscape as a fitness landscape for a model with four parameters is five dimensional with the fifth dimension being the objective function value i e the fitness the complete fitness landscape is unable to be visualized consequently in order to enable key aspects of the overall fitness landscape to be inspected separate three dimensional fitness landscapes are generated for the shape and rate parameters α and β respectively and the probability of wet dry and dry dry parameters the required fitness values are calculated using the unweighted objective function eq 2 for three attributes all held at historical levels ptot nwet and p99 as part of this process the random seed used in the weather generator is held constant to maintain a set relationship between parameters and attribute values guo et al 2018 the resulting fitness landscapes are shown in fig 5 as can be seen the fitness landscape in the left panel is smooth as the gamma function from which rainfall amounts are sampled is continuous so that changes to the gamma distribution parameters result directly in changes in rainfall volume as a fixed random seed was used to eliminate stochastic noise as mentioned above in contrast the fitness landscape on the right is rough with many local optima this is due to discrete changes in the response surface as a result of changing the number of wet and dry days based on this finding it is likely that irregular response surfaces will be a feature of markov based weather generators including the higher dimensional seasonal model also used in this paper suggesting that there is no need to perform fitness landscape analysis for the more complex model the diagnosis therefore suggests that stochastic search algorithms should be used for implementing the inverse approach as hill climbing methods are likely to get stuck in local optima and thus fail to find the best possible solution there is a wide range of stochastic search algorithms that could be used for response surfaces such as that illustrated in fig 5 including shuffled complex evolution ant colony optimization and genetic algorithms dorigo et al 1996 duan et al 1993 holland 1992 in this study a genetic algorithm is used scrucca 2013 as this algorithm has been found to be effective in optimizing single objective functions with rough fitness landscapes the parameter values for each operator of the genetic algorithm used are provided in table 2 a population and number of generations of 200 were chosen to ensure solutions converged and the remaining parameters were recommended by scrucca 2013 4 2 reducing the optimization search space in order to determine appropriate bounds for the parameters of the weather generators for the case study location in adelaide both weather generators were calibrated to 2870 awap grid locations spanning all climatic regions of australia at a 50 km resolution using the approach set out in richardson 1981 given the significant variability in rainfall time series across continental australia which spans tropical temperate alpine mediterranean semi arid and arid climates this approach is likely to provide a reasonable proxy of the range of variability anticipated for the case study location as a result of future climate change the actual domain knowledge informed parameter bounds were taken as the 0 3th and 99 7th percentile of the values of the 2870 rainfall time series and are summarized in tables 3 and 4 to enable the benefits of reducing the size of the search space to be assessed the inverse approach was used to generate time series with the set of attributes shown in table 1 for this test all attributes were set at a target of their historical levels i e they were all held attributes both weather generators were used for time series generation each with the domain knowledge informed parameters bounds and the wider uniformed bounds used by guo et al 2018 see tables 3 and 4 for the annual weather generator the use of domain knowledge informed bounds was able to reduce the volume of the search space by seven orders of magnitude whereas for the seasonal generator the volume was reduced by fifteen orders of magnitude all optimization runs were repeated 50 times from different random starting positions in the solution space to minimize the influence of the random search behavior of the genetic algorithm in contrast the weather generator seed was held constant for all simulations to ensure consistency in the fitness landscape as mentioned previously fig 6 compares the reduction in objective function value at each optimization generation when domain knowledge informed bounds and uninformed bounds are used to restrict the parameter values for the annual weather generator left panel and the seasonal weather generator right panel for the annual weather generator the optimization with informed parameter bounds converges much more quickly and finds better solutions i e three orders of magnitudes smaller than the optimization with the uniformed bounds for the computational budget of 200 generations the objective function error for the informed bounds experiment at generation 200 was 0 09 compared to 130 for the uninformed bounds experiment left panel fig 6 the benefits of using parameter informed bounds is more pronounced for the seasonal weather generator right panel such that at generation 200 the objective function errors are approximately five orders of magnitude larger when uninformed parameter bounds are used 56 212 compared to 0 202 for the informed bounds this highlights the potential benefits of search space size reduction by using domain knowledge informed parameters in terms of increasing the computational efficiency of the inverse approach and hence increasing the chances of finding better solutions especially for higher dimensional search spaces such as those associated with more complex weather generators 5 ensuring the realism of hydrometeorological time series to ensure realistic time series are generated by the inverse approach the penalty structures presented in section 2 3 are applied to the adelaide case study section 5 1 tests how penalty functions work when creating targeted time series in different regions of a scenario neutral space the simple annual weather generator and the linear penalty function eq 3 are used for this demonstration section 5 2 then compares the effect of the two penalty function structures using the more complex seasonal weather generator how well penalty functions can be used to focus on two perturbed attributes at once is investigated in section 5 3 these results are specific to the weather generators attributes and target time series used in this case study consequently the process of examining how the results change with different penalty scaling parameters is something that should be repeated for each implementation of the inverse approach to ensure the time series are created with the most appropriate trade offs across the perturbed and held attributes 5 1 focusing on an attribute with two target perturbations in order to determine how penalty functions perform in creating time series in different regions of a scenario neutral space two target time series are generated using the simple annual weather generator and a linear penalty term eq 3 the perturbed attribute in both cases is ptot with the first target having no change in all selected attributes from historical levels table 1 and the second target having a 30 decrease in the total annual rainfall volume ptot with no change in other attributes fig 7 shows the distance from the target of each attribute as a percentage error across 50 optimisation seeds for varying λ values for both targets the λ 0 cases show the error breakdown across the selected attributes using an unweighted objective function i e equivalent to eq 2 for the historical target when λ 0 the error is low and spread relatively evenly across each attribute top panel the error in this context arises because of structural deficiencies in the simple annual weather generator relative to the complex historical rainfall time series so that the weather generator is not able to faithfully simulate all the historical values of the perturbed and held attributes for the second target a 30 decrease in ptot the error is much more varied across attributes and the ptot attribute has 20 error whereas the other attributes have less than 10 error bottom panel this again results from a lack of flexibility in the annual weather generator it lacks the degrees of freedom to change ptot alone to reduce the error in the attribute ptot its weight in the objective function needs to be increased this trade off in the error between the perturbed and the held attributes changes with increasing scaling parameter values λ fig 7 once λ 2 the error in ptot is approximately zero however the error in three held attributes nwet p90 and p99 has increased the average dry spell duration dsd is the only attribute that does not increase its error as it only depends on the wet dry first order markov chain in contrast the error in the number of wet days increases which is likely because this attribute more directly affects the number of high rain days sampled in a year the above results demonstrate that the selection of λ can be used to manage the trade off in error between ptot and the held attributes the decision as to which value of λ is most appropriate should be made on a case by case basis by considering the importance of errors in the held attributes relative to errors in the perturbed attributes note that the results indicate some targets require higher penalty scaling parameter values during optimization to make time series with zero error in the perturbed attribute 5 2 comparing two penalty function structures in order to examine the differences between the two penalty structures proposed in section 2 3 both penalty structures eqs 3 and 4 are used to create the same target time series the requested target time series corresponds to a 30 increase in ptot which is the perturbed attribute with all other attributes held constant the target time series are created using the seasonal weather generator for the desired attributes table 1 to see how the penalties perform with more attributes in the objective function fig 8 shows the breakdown of errors across each attribute for the linear penalty term top and the quadratic penalty bottom the trialed scaling parameter values differ between the investigated penalties the linear penalty scaling parameter was varied from 0 to 4 and the quadratic penalty scaling parameter was varied from 5 to 25 as can be seen from fig 8 top panel the linear penalty term performs in a similar manner to when it was used with the annual generator fig 7 bottom panel despite the addition of two attributes one difference is that the error in the nwet attribute is higher for the seasonal weather generator it should be noted that this distribution of error is a property of three separate elements of the optimization problem the attributes chosen the target set and the weather generator used with more attributes in the objective function attributes like nwet that had high error for the annual generator are now weighted relatively less and thus have higher error when the seasonal generator is used however despite the changes in error a value of λ 2 is still enough to satisfy the perturbed attribute target for the quadratic penalty term the error in the perturbed attribute does not reach zero instead it approaches zero as the scaling parameter increases like in the example case shown in fig 4 section 2 3 note that larger scaling parameter values are used to reduce the error in the perturbed attribute because the square root of the scaling parameter is taken in eq 4 fig 8 bottom panel as a result there is less overall error in the simulated time series when averaged across the perturbed and held attributes this is best demonstrated by examining the nwet attribute in the top and bottom panels of fig 8 as the scaling parameter increases the error in this attribute is around 5 less for the quadratic penalty term than it is with the linear penalty term even though the perturbed attribute has near zero error the decision behind which penalty structure to use in applications of the inverse approach should be made by considering the importance of error in the attributes for example if a target time series is set with the primary intention of reaching zero error in ptot and the other attributes are selected to make sure the stochastic time series stay similar to historical conditions then the linear term penalty with high λ value could be used however if the ptot target does not need to be precisely simulated and the other attributes have a strong bearing on system performance the time series found using the quadratic penalty term might be more appropriate for analysis as a result for potential future applications it is likely that a process of trial and error would be needed to obtain an appropriate compromise in the trade off in errors between attributes and thus the penalty function and associated value of λ 5 3 focusing on two perturbed attributes in order to determine if objective function penalties can be used to guide the error for multiple attributes time series are created with two perturbed attributes in addition to ptot these time series will be created with the number of wet days in the year nwet as a penalized attribute fig 9 shows the error breakdown for each attribute for the requested target of historical conditions using two perturbed attributes and varying the λ values for the linear penalty term eq 3 here both ptot and nwet are selected as perturbed attributes figs 7 and 8 as previous results demonstrated the difficulty in achieving low error in both ptot and nwet simultaneously fig 9 demonstrates that the seasonal weather generator can achieve near zero error in both perturbed attributes given two appropriate penalty scaling parameters this is first seen when λ ptot 1 and λ nwet 2 in this case the penalty terms are enough to make the error in the five held attributes higher than they would be with only ptot penalized as in previous cases their error stayed low while nwet increased further these results show that the nwet attribute should be weighted twice as much as the ptot attribute for both to achieve near zero error from their target again this ratio will be a property of the weather generator and requested targets to summarise the impact of penalty functions we compare the difference in the creation of a 4x4 regular grid scenario neutral space 16 target time series using the unweighted objective function eq 2 and the objective function with a linear penalty term eq 3 with λ ptot 3 and λ nwet 3 to ensure each target is met the requested scenario neutral space varies ptot and nwet from 70 to 130 of their historical values all other targets are held at historical conditions fig 10 compares the performance of the two optimization outcomes when the unweighted objective function is over constrained the two perturbed attributes cannot meet their targets left panel fig 10 this was also demonstrated in section 5 2 where the error was spread across seven attributes when λ 0 fig 8 top panel in fig 10 this is seen as a clustering in the simulated targets for the ptot dimension in particular the simulated targets are more varied in simulating nwet achieving a 30 decrease but struggling to meet a 30 increase this is due to the weather generator structure where the number of wet days can be decreased with minimal impact on the rainfall volume extremes or seasonality as the wet dry sequence is changed independently in contrast the use of penalties in the objective function enables the generation of time series with attributes that match two target perturbed attributes for the majority of the scenario neutral space right panel fig 10 however this comes at the cost of increasing the error in the remaining held attributes as can be seen from the mean held attribute error shown below each target in fig 10 taking the example of the top right target circled in red when the unweighted objective function is used the held attributes are within 10 of historical levels on average however both perturbed attributes are 15 away from their targets in order for both perturbed attributes to reach their target the error in the held attributes increases by a further 9 on average given the purpose of the held attributes is usually to ensure the realism of the time series prioritization towards the perturbed attributes at the expense of the held attributes in most cases will be desirable 6 conclusions the effectiveness of scenario neutral approaches hinges on the ability to stress test systems against plausible realizations of future climate however the range of changes in climate that can be examined is limited by the methods used to create the perturbed time series recently the inverse approach has been presented as a method capable of producing perturbations to complex measures of hydrometeorological variables by using formal optimization techniques with stochastic weather generators conceptually this method can be applied to generate weather time series that represent not only changes in the averages but also changes in the variability intermittency extremes seasonality and or inter annual persistence however there are two key challenges to implementing the method the large computational effort required to create the perturbed stochastic time series and the difficulty in ensuring the realism of the time series this paper presents approaches to overcome these challenges and improve the effectiveness of the inverse approach specific implementations were demonstrated using the case study of adelaide australia with a simple annual weather generator and a more complex seasonal weather generator as methods to increase the efficiency of an optimization process can be algorithm specific a first step is to diagnose the nature of the optimization problem for the weather generators used in the case study the optimization fitness landscape was found to be irregular due to the first order markov chain used to sequence wet and dry days as a result a genetic algorithm was selected and two sets of bounds on the decision variables were compared one set of uninformed bounds and one set based on the parameter values obtained when calibrating the weather generators to sites around australia results demonstrated that the domain knowledge informed bounds increased the convergence of the optimization process by a significant amount and led to a reduction in fitness values by two orders of magnitude for the seasonal weather generator this indicates that using domain knowledge of the weather generator parameters when employing the inverse approach can increase the efficiency of the approach particularly with more complex weather generators the proposed approach for ensuring the realism of generated time series is to include attributes in the objective function that keep all properties of the time series near historical levels other than those that are being actively perturbed this has the side effect of both making the problem more complex and creating infeasible target requests e g increasing the total rainfall in the year without changing either the number of wet days or the average amount per day the recommended solution is to add penalties to the objective function that prioritize meeting the perturbed attribute targets while ensuring that the remaining attributes are held as close to their historical values as possible two penalty function structures were explored on multiple target perturbations for various values of the penalty scaling parameter when compared to an unweighted objective function results show that the use of penalties is beneficial for creating realistic hydrometeorological time series for use in scenario neutral spaces currently the optimization approach is formulated to create step changes in climate attributes as these time series are required for scenario neutral spaces further work is required to extend this optimization formulation to creating transient time series for use in other scenario neutral impact assessments that do not generate scenario neutral spaces both these advances to the inverse approach allow for a greater range of perturbations to be made to historical climate records this enables the stress testing of systems against a broader range of climate attributes and crucially identifying system vulnerabilities in response to this change this ultimately will help ensure scenario neutral analyses are able to identify system responses and potential failure modes to a much

protocols and quality assurance still must be resolved we propose three promising areas for future studies in drylands 1 isotopic sampling of vadose zone water vapor using laser spectroscopy 2 improved definition identification of diffusive pathways and 3 robust upscaling from incongruent hydrometric and isotopic measurements keywords drylands evapotranspiration partitioning hydrometric interception laser isotope spectroscopy leaf area index scaling evaporation transpiration stable isotope 1 introduction drylands cover about 40 of the global landmass and up to 44 of cultivated lands supporting 35 of the global population safriel et al 2006 drylands can be grouped into four categories according to level of aridity hyper arid arid semiarid and dry subhumid berry sandra et al 2006 sustainable and efficient management of these ecosystems requires an in depth understanding of the water cycle and especially of the evapotranspiration et component which typically accounts for 90 95 of annual precipitation kurc and small 2004 wilcox et al 2003 zhang et al 2011 the bulk et flux consists of interception evaporation i soil evaporation e and plant transpiration t partitioning of et determination of the relative importance of these constituent fluxes usually expressed as a ratio t et or e et is a challenging exercise but is essential for understanding dryland ecohydrology kool et al 2014 newman et al 2006 wang et al 2010 this rationale is well supported considering the following facts partitioning of et is critical for quantifying 1 water use efficiency lu et al 2017 williams et al 2004 2 ecosystem productivity brooks 2015 yepez et al 2003 and sustainability raz yaseef et al 2012 3 biological water demand and its influence on the hydrologic cycle newman et al 2006 and 4 the coupling of hydrologic and biogeochemical cycles austin et al 2004 jasechko 2018 wang et al 2012 partitioning of et is essential for calibrating and validating surface plant atmosphere transfer models braud et al 2005 kroes et al 2017 sutanto et al 2012 land surface models aouade et al 2016 wong et al 2017 and the land atmosphere interaction in climate models lawrence et al 2007 zhang et al 2016 the processes of i e and t differ not only in timing and duration dickinson et al 2003 but also with respect to the mechanisms involved in phase change the latter differences being responsible for the dissimilarities in stable isotope composition among these constituent fluxes savenije 2004 a clear understanding of et partitioning is especially crucial for sustainable management of water resources in drylands which are expected to be increasingly limited under climate change mounting demographic pressures and competition from many other socio economic sectors a fundamental strategy for reaching a sustainable level of agricultural water consumption is that of enhancing the productive component t and curtailing the unproductive component e falkenmark and rockström 2004 topics on et partitioning have been summarized in a few studies kool et al 2014 comprehensively reviewed methodologies available for et partitioning including both in situ measurement and modeling on the basis of 52 publications yakir and sternberg 2000 reviewed the isotopic approach for measuring gas exchange at the ecosystem level schlesinger and jasechko 2014 compiled 81 worldwide studies on et partitioning at the ecosystem scale and found that t et is relatively lower in semiarid ecosystems 51 15 for steppe desert and shrublands than in wet climates e g 70 14 for tropical forests wang et al 2014 synthesized the relationship between t et and leaf area index lai at a global scale on the basis of 48 published studies and wei et al 2017 further refined this relationship for different vegetation types to our knowledge however there has been no synthesis of what is known about et partitioning in drylands in this paper on the basis of a meta analysis of the pertinent in situ studies we discuss four topics relevant to et partitioning 1 the approaches and methodologies commonly used for field studies 2 the general trends in et partitioning in dryland ecosystems 3 emerging themes from the literature and 4 challenges and opportunities for future investigations 2 literature collection using the web of science core collection http apps webofknowledge com we searched for relevant peer reviewed journal articles published in english from 1987 to june 2018 we used mutated combinations of the following inquiry terms evapotranspiration and partition evaporation and transpiration dryland or water limited and semiarid or semi arid or arid we filtered the retrieved raw records 200 with the following criteria 1 quantitative separation of the et flux whether into two constituents e and t or three e t and i 2 major results obtained from in situ studies at the site or plot scale rather than from modeling or remote sensing at the regional scale and 3 at least two independent measurements in parallel of the three variables et e and t the outcome was the selection of 31 in situ studies from drylands across the world fig 1 which yielded 38 datasets tables 1 and 2 some studies scott and biederman 2017 yimam et al 2015 encompassed multiple ecosystems and or different treatments in which case we labeled each ecosystem treatment as a separate dataset if exact numeric values relevant to et partitioning were given only in graphs we extracted those values with engauge digitizer 10 4 mark mitchell engauge digitizer https github com markummitchell engauge digitizer as shown in figs 1 and 2 the great majority about 80 of the retrieved studies were conducted in semiarid climates whereas those done in hyper arid and subhumid climates account for only about 10 5 each category on the basis of the information provided in the original records we grouped the dryland ecosystems into the following eight types grassland savanna shrubland open woodland forest orchard cropland and marshland semiarid climate grasslands and shrublands are the two most common natural ecosystems each representing more than 15 agro ecosystems including croplands and orchards usually irrigated are also well represented 38 across the spectrum of climatic aridity the most common crops were winter wheat and maize table 2 3 approaches and methods used in the et partitioning studies following the practice of previous studies laudon et al 2004 sutanto et al 2014 we grouped the widely used in situ measurement methods for et partitioning into two overarching approaches hydrometric and isotopic fig 3 of the 31 published studies in our meta analysis 15 used mainly the hydrometric approach table 1 and 16 used mainly the isotopic approach table 2 however these two approaches are usually integrated for et partitioning especially at the ecosystem or larger scales good et al 2014 williams et al 2004 xiao et al 2018 3 1 hydrometric approach multiple hydrometric methods are available for measuring the bulk et flux or its constituents individually micro meteorological techniques such as bowen ratio energy budget and eddy covariance provide only an aggregate of et fluxes based on energy balance however multiple algebraic methods have been proposed that are capable of partitioning et via additional measurements such as ground surface temperature moran et al 2009 or gross ecosystem photosynthesis scott and biederman 2017 another recently proposed method for partitioning et is based on the assumption of flux variance similarity in high frequency eddy covariance data scanlon and kustas 2012 skaggs et al 2018 wang et al 2016b in addition zhou et al 2016 have proposed a concept called underlying water use efficiency uwue this concept estimates t et as a ratio of average over potential uwue by assuming that potential uwue is related to t and average uwue is related to et to obtain transpiration t xylem sap flow is commonly measured by various thermic techniques allen and grime 1995 burgess et al 2001 granier 1987 poyatos et al 2016 gas exchange chambers are also widely used to measure transpiration at smaller scales such as leaf or stem pearcy et al 2000 stannard and weltz 2006 yepez et al 2005 for soil evaporation e the micro lysimeter is an inexpensive and reliable tool when roots are excluded from the sampling soil column good et al 2014 this tool is especially popular and convenient for loose and shallow soils in irrigated croplands evaporation from canopy interception i is obtained by subtracting the sum of throughfall and stemflow from the measured above canopy precipitation five of our retrieved studies explicitly included measurements or calculations of interception mitchell et al 2009 raz yaseef et al 2010 wang and wang 2017 yaseef et al 2010 yimam et al 2015 these hydrometric methods are often used in combination to measure different constituents of the et flux at the site or plot scale table 1 or used for comparison with and validation of other methods perez priego et al 2017 widmoser and wohlfahrt 2018 3 2 isotopic approach water vapor from soil evaporation is usually lighter in isotopic composition than that from transpiration because during soil evaporation the liquid vapor phase change involves a strong fractionation process being a substantial factor in dryland ecosystems the isotopically lighter soil evaporation contrasts strongly with the isotopically heavier transpiration which facilitates the practical application of the isotopic approach good et al 2014 there are two major methodologies by which the isotopic approach is used one is the two source mixing model expressed as 1 t et δ et δ e δ t δ e where δ et is the isotopic composition of the aggregated et flux and δ e and δ t are the isotopic compositions of evaporation and transpiration respectively various techniques and measuring methods have been developed to quantify these three isotopic values table 2 and fig 3 for δ et the keeling plot method keeling 1958 yakir and sternberg 2000 and the flux gradient method griffis et al 2004 both based on isotopic sampling of atmospheric water vapor within the ecosystem boundary layer are widely used for δ e the craig gordon method craig and gordon 1965 horita et al 2008 has become a quasi standard method for δ t both steady state theory and non steady state theory are often used depending on the temporal resolution barnard et al 2006 flanagan and ehleringer 1991 wang and yakir 1995 the second methodology is isotopic mass balance under steady state conditions it can be simplified as 2 p δ p q δ q e δ e t δ t where p and δ p represent precipitation and its isotopic composition while q and δ q represent runoff and its isotopic composition this method has been applied at scales ranging from that of soil profile ferretti et al 2003 gaj et al 2016 to that of regional watershed guo et al 2017 the development of the isotopic approach has been thoroughly discussed elsewhere kool et al 2014 sutanto et al 2014 wang et al 2012 xiao et al 2018 yakir and sternberg 2000 zhang et al 2010 the isotopic approach requires extensive sampling of water from different reservoirs within the ecohydrologic cycle to study the isotopic dynamics of atmospheric water vapor cryogenic trapping systems barron gafford et al 2017 han et al 2006 helliker et al 2002 zhang et al 2011 have often been used however the trapping method involves a slow a few hours and laborious process of sample collection resulting in low temporal resolution and discreteness of the data series in contrast to such discrete snapshots field deployable laser spectroscopy has become increasingly popular for its ability to directly sample atmospheric water vapor and to measure the isotopic composition with high temporal resolution and an accuracy comparable with that of traditional isotope ratio mass spectroscopy berman et al 2013 these laser instruments greatly expand the applicability of stable water isotopologues in ecohydrologic studies wang et al 2012 for the 16 studies using the isotopic approach table 2 14 studies used the single isotope method either 2h or 18o and only two gaj et al 2016 yepez et al 2003 used the double single isotope method 2h and 18o simultaneously the 2h method is preferable for estimating δ et owing to its high sensitivity aouade et al 2016 in terms of labeling two studies used artificially labeled water for et partitioning good et al 2014 yepez et al 2005 and one used injection of deuterated water into the groundwater to separate the sourcing depths for transpiration balugani et al 2017 3 3 application of the hydrometric and isotopic approaches in dryland ecosystems the in situ studies reported on in our 31 retrieved publications made extensive use of the hydrometric and isotopic approaches fig 4 a the measurement periods vary dramatically from one study to another ranging from one day yepez et al 2003 zhang et al 2011 to the length of the growing season or even a full year tables 1 and 2 the shorter term investigations most not exceeding 10 days were classified as intermittent studies these typically were carried out with the isotopic approach owing to the need for extensive sampling and close human monitoring in only two isotopic studies in croplands were measurements taken throughout the growing season lu et al 2017 wen et al 2016 long term investigations at either the growing season or the annual scale are typically carried out with the hydrometric approach one hydrometric study even used climatic records covering more than a decade scott and biederman 2017 4 general trends in et partitioning in dryland ecosystems comparison of long term annual mean precipitation fig 4b soil texture fig 4c and ecosystem types fig 5 a reveals no clear trends in et partitioning results from longer term investigations growing season or annual scale show that in natural ecosystems evaporation and transpiration are largely equivalent whereas in agro ecosystems usually irrigated the transpiration fraction is relatively higher fig 5a results for t et from the longer term studies in natural ecosystems showed less variability 0 37 0 84 mean value standard deviation of 0 52 0 13 n 13 than those from the intermittent studies 0 06 0 85 mean value standard deviation of 0 47 0 34 n 9 the 0 06 minimum value for one of the intermittent studies was observed in an open woodland 7 plant coverage under dry summer conditions balugani et al 2017 indicating that t et is lower for woodlands with sparse vegetation canopies agro ecosystems showed higher t et with intermittent measurements ranging from 0 46 to 0 78 mean value of 0 65 0 13 n 5 and longer term measurements from 0 44 to 0 90 mean value of 0 66 0 17 n 9 maximum t et values are similar for natural ecosystems and agro ecosystems with the exception of open woodlands namely around 0 75 0 85 which agree with the maximum values of 0 72 0 90 found at the global scale for natural and agricultural systems characterized by low lai wang et al 2014 no general trends were identified in the relationship between plant fractional cover and ecosystem type fig 5b whereas lai means and maximums showed higher values in agro ecosystems than in natural ones fig 5c the linear regression between converted t et and plant canopy characteristics revealed that mean and maximum lai values explained 45 and 37 respectively of the variations in t et whereas plant fractional cover failed to be an effective explanatory variable fig 6 all values in fig 6 are log transformed because of the power law relationship between t et and the vegetation canopy parameters see eq 3 in section 5 6 statistically the regression was strongly significant for mean lai p value 0 01 and significant for maximum lai p value 0 05 however the coefficient of determination r 2 reported in this analysis is relatively low table 3 implying that the explanatory power of lai for t et variability is constrained in dryland ecosystems 5 major themes identified via the meta analysis 5 1 et partitioning during dynamic wetting drying episodes the pattern of rare and irregular precipitation events that characterizes dryland ecosystems creates pulses of high and low biotic activity snyder and tartowski 2006 consequently during the dynamic wetting and drying cycles both plant transpiration and soil evaporation can undergo rapid changes yepez et al 2005 soil evaporation is negligible when soils are dry but after precipitation it becomes significant within a short period usually a few days hu et al 2014 wang et al 2016a wang and yakir 2000 then once it has peaked evaporation declines rapidly transpiration which is suppressed during rainfall evett et al 2012 peaks more slowly and also declines more gradually after precipitation scott et al 2006 because of the differences in temporal dynamics between soil evaporation and transpiration the pattern of et partitioning varies significantly during these wetting drying episodes as examples a study of a semiarid forest found that soil evaporation dominated et shortly after a rain event with e et ranging between 49 and 65 gaj et al 2016 a study of a semiarid shrubland with more than 90 coverage showed that daily average e et decreased from 34 to 3 during the first two sunny days after precipitation xu et al 2008 and in a chihuahuan desert evaporation dominated et at the onset of summer rains but 2 4 weeks after the occurrence of large precipitation events shrub vegetation recovered and began to transpire at peak rates cavanaugh et al 2011 scott and biederman 2017 scott et al 2006 similar phenomena were often observed for irrigated agro ecosystems examples include a winter wheat field where e et was 0 20 before irrigation and 0 31 after irrigation aouade et al 2016 an olive olea europaea l orchard where e et was nearly 0 prior to irrigation then reached 0 31 by midday on the sixth day following irrigation williams et al 2004 and a cotton cropland where e et equaled or exceeded t et for four days after irrigation but began a dramatic decrease from the fifth day ham et al 1990 in contrast to this trend of increasing e et shortly after irrigation an exception was reported for a semiarid sparse grassland eragrostis lehmanniana with loamy sandy soil where e et dropped following the irrigation pulse in such environments soil evaporation is typically the dominant flux and transpiration the minor flux but with the rapid infiltration of irrigation water causing a short period of plant available soil water in the rooting zone transpiration increased briefly the corresponding decrease in e et to 0 57 0 65 occurred within three days after irrigation by day 7 e et had again risen to 0 78 yepez et al 2005 5 2 factors controlling evaporation and transpiration are different evaporation and transpiration are controlled by different factors soil evaporation is a physical process mostly affected by abiotic factors including vapor pressure deficit vpd water availability in the surface soil and the shading effect of the vegetation canopy plant transpiration on the other hand takes place through the soil plant atmosphere continuum and is controlled by both abiotic and biotic factors including plant available soil water in the rooting zone vpd and physiological regulation of leaf stomata a study of an olive orchard olea europaea l showed that during wetting drying cycles daily rates of soil evaporation correlated positively with daily vpd but transpiration did not williams et al 2004 seasonal scale investigations in a semiarid eucalyptus woodland found that daily rates of transpiration tracked seasonal changes in radiation and drainage whereas daily rates of evaporation correlated positively with surface soil moisture content mitchell et al 2009 similar results were found in a semiarid shrubland cavanaugh et al 2011 and a pine forest raz yaseef et al 2012 where soil evaporation was closely correlated with solar radiation and surface soil moisture whereas transpiration was correlated with soil moisture in the deeper layers this difference the dependence of evaporation on shallow soil moisture and of transpiration on deeper soil moisture was also observed in agro ecosystems zhang et al 2011 5 3 controlling factors differ according to temporal scale the factors controlling et partitioning vary at different temporal scales ambient atmospheric conditions show high variability at the diurnal scale whereas plant phenology exhibits great variations across the growing season especially with changes in the precipitation pattern dry vs wet for example in a study of a semiarid grassland hu et al 2014 found that vpd was a significant factor at the diurnal scale resulting in a u shaped diurnal pattern of t et a similar diurnal t et pattern was found in another dryland grassland but over the longer timescale of a two week period of green up and senescence green lai and available soil water were the controlling factors for t et dynamics good et al 2014 for semiarid sites characterized by summer rainfall t et reached a peak coincident with the maximum lai suggesting the strong effect of plant phenology and precipitation pattern on et partitioning scott and biederman 2017 similarly a modeling study in grassland ecosystems concluded that t et was controlled by canopy stomatal conductance at the diurnal scale and by lai at the seasonal and annual scales hu et al 2009 5 4 effects of precipitation and soil moisture dynamics on et partitioning how et is partitioned in a given ecosystem depends on the temporal pattern of precipitation distribution whether precipitation is concentrated into a few big events or scattered among many smaller ones huxman et al 2004 scott and biederman 2017 for example a study conducted in a semiarid forest found that annual t et was more influenced by large storms 30 mm than by the annual precipitation totals raz yaseef et al 2012 probably because only intense storms can result in deep infiltration and thus plant available soil moisture for trees a similar phenomenon was observed in semiarid grasslands and shrublands in arizona usa where seasonal t et was found to be relatively insensitive to precipitation patterns when precipitation was near to below normal moran et al 2009 conditions under which deep soil water infiltration probably rarely occurred 5 5 effects of interception on et partitioning uncertainty concerning the contribution of interception is the largest source of bias in et partitioning wei et al 2017 the amount of rainfall intercepted by the vegetation canopy and the debris layer depends on rainfall frequency and the structural characteristics and physiological properties of the vegetation in arid and semiarid climates sporadic and short precipitation events coupled with high vpd could result in a substantial amount of evaporation via interception laio et al 2001 examples include a semiarid eucalyptus e capillosa woodland where 8 15 of the rainfall was intercepted of which 69 evaporated and 31 was yielded as stem flow mitchell et al 2009 and a semiarid pine forest where interception accounted for 10 12 of annual precipitation and more than 20 during the rainy season raz yaseef et al 2010 raz yaseef et al 2012 in contrast interception could be negligible in sparsely vegetated dryland ecosystems such as a desert shrubland in northern china where interception accounted for only 3 2 of precipitation during the growing season zhao et al 2016 5 6 effects of vegetation canopy on et partitioning several researchers noted that patterns of et partitioning are influenced by the various characteristics of the vegetation canopy such as lai and fractional cover wang et al 2010 phenological development during the growing season montoro et al 2016 and tree age wang and wang 2017 studies of the relationship between lai and t et at the global scale wang et al 2014 wei et al 2017 suggest that lai can be the first order controlling factor for t et as expressed in the following power law function 3 t e t a l a i b where coefficients a and b are specific to vegetation types see table 3 for results from the retrieved studies and several other pertinent investigations it has been argued that this power law function applies only to situations in which lai is below a certain threshold below that threshold t et increases quickly and proportionally in response to increases in lai but above it t et is no longer sensitive to changes in lai for example an lai threshold of 4 was found for a cropland of winter wheat and summer corn wang and liu 2007 and a threshold of approximately 2 7 for a cotton and sorghum site ritchie and burnett 1971 this threshold phenomenon may be attributable to suppression of transpiration per unit of lai for well developed or thickened plant canopy a simulation based on tree mosaics also revealed that as lai increased t et gradually fell below a 1 1 proportionality villegas et al 2015 the retrieved datasets show a high variability in t et a range of 0 06 0 90 fig 4b c and fig 5a wide variations in t et were also reported at a global scale for ecosystems with low lai e g 0 5 indicating the possibility of high t et even under low lai conditions wang et al 2014 a modeling study of grassland ecosystems also revealed that the relationship between t et and lai is more erratic in semiarid and subhumid sites than in humid sites hu et al 2009 this greater variation in t et for low lai ecosystems implies that other biological or meteorological factors might play a substantial role for example in a semiarid steppe region of inner mongolia china in a year with normal precipitation t et decreased under grazing because of the reduction in lai wang et al 2016a in contrast in a dry year the grazing induced reduction in lai did not influence t et because plant physiological functions were suppressed by the drought conditions 5 7 effects of groundwater on et partitioning for sites with shallow groundwater depths of 0 10 m groundwater evaporation and root water uptake should be explicitly considered for example in an oak savanna groundwater uptake by blue oak accounted for 70 90 of total et during the dry summer miller et al 2010 in a semiarid floodplain woodland the ability of the dominant deep rooted velvet mesquite prosopis velutina to access groundwater contributed to an unusually high t et ratio 0 90 during the growing season yepez et al 2007 similarly in a desert shrubland groundwater lying about 5 7 m below the surface became the main source for both evaporation and transpiration zhao et al 2016 and in a semiarid open woodland evaporation of shallow groundwater accounted for up to one third of total et but only after soil moisture in the vadose zone had been depleted balugani et al 2017 6 emerging technologies challenges and opportunities our understanding of et fluxes and partitioning of et in drylands has advanced dramatically in the past few decades owing to enhanced capabilities in measurement technologies data availability and numerical modeling at the same time the particular nature of ecohydrologic processes in drylands especially the heterogeneity in spatial temporal scales means that et partitioning in these regions remains challenging 6 1 field deployable isotopic laser spectroscopy for water vapor analysis the isotopic approach for et partitioning is continuing to evolve the methods traditionally used for sampling water from soils and plants have major limitations such as 1 the destructive nature of sampling and 2 the laborious and time consuming procedure of cryogenic vacuum distillation in addition the isotopic representativeness of plant samples remains debatable cernusak et al 2016 roden et al 2000 rothfuss and javaux 2017 for drylands a special challenge is that under very dry conditions the negligible flux of soil evaporation might prevent reliable calculation of δ et because of the absence of detectable vertical gradients in vapor concentrations and in the isotopic compositions of water vapor yepez et al 2005 extreme conditions of heat and aridity will decrease the equilibrium fractionation factor horita et al 2008 rendering the end members δ e and δ t insufficiently distinguishable lu et al 2017 which translates to a high degree of uncertainty for the isotopic approach a critical question in quantifying the isotopic composition of soil evaporation is how fractionation processes affect the isotopic composition of soil water gaj et al 2016 which under conditions of intense evaporation exhibits high variability across the profile hu et al 2014 during the dry season vapor transport can dominate water diffusion in the vadose zone and plays a key role in mass and energy transfer within soils bittelli et al 2008 deb et al 2011 to determine the effects of fractionation processes then isotopic sampling of water vapor across the soil profile is essential balugani et al 2017 a promising tool for sampling of soil water vapor in the vadose zone is field deployable laser isotope spectroscopy which enables direct continuous and non destructive measurement gaj et al 2016 herbstritt et al 2012 oerter et al 2017 in situ sampling of soil water vapor has been performed both to study water vapor dynamics gaj et al 2016 oerter et al 2017 soderberg et al 2012 volkmann and weiler 2014 and to derive the isotopic composition of liquid soil water based on the water vapor equilibrium assumption herbstritt et al 2012 this assumption is supported by a case study in a semiarid african savanna where the liquid vapor interface was measured in situ in the soil profile soderberg et al 2012 the major concern during sampling of soil water vapor for isotopic analysis is fractionation caused by either inducing evaporation of liquid soil water or condensation of vapor inside the sampling apparatus soderberg et al 2012 at present standard sampling protocols with wide applicability are still under development stumpp et al 2018 6 2 water diffusion pathways from ground to atmosphere to be consistent and comparable in situ studies on et partitioning must identify and take into account the various diffusive pathways by which water moves from terrestrial ecosystems to the near surface atmosphere in the past many field studies ignored the role of evaporation underneath the canopy considering it to be negligible because of the shading effect balugani et al 2017 an accurate quantification of under canopy evaporation necessitates the application of either an extinction coefficient for radiation diffusion or a threshold lai value wang and liu 2007 for two layered ecosystems e g savannas and shrublands even though transpiration fluxes can be combined to simplify analysis xu et al 2008 transpiration from the upper tree shrub layer and from the understory herbaceous layer should be measured separately wei et al 2017 such detailed in situ studies are essential for quantifying the different diffusive pathways for plant transpiration and for identifying the biophysical factors that control transpiration from different functional types dubbert et al 2014 6 3 scaling and modeling dryland ecosystems characterized by scarce and sporadic precipitation as well as low vegetation coverage exhibit considerable spatial heterogeneity along with high temporal variability in plant physiological activity newman et al 2010 raz yaseef et al 2012 villegas et al 2014 for these reasons upscaling of measurements from the stand or plot scale is quite challenging for example upscaling of sap flow is highly uncertain and error prone first because the scaling relationships for different parameters basal area plant density canopy height canopy coverage sapwood area lai vary widely poyatos et al 2016 and second because plants of different functional types have different phenological stages wang et al 2014 yepez et al 2003 when sap flow is being compared with et fluxes obtained by eddy covariance measurement the upscaling needs to be confined to the contributing footprints of the turbulent fluxes williams et al 2004 coupling of the eddy covariance method with laser isotope spectroscopy could make it possible for ecosystem level et partitioning to be accomplished without the need for scaling ferretti et al 2003 williams et al 2004 xiao et al 2018 in addition this combined methodology can be expanded to measurement of carbon isotopes thereby enabling the partition of co2 dynamics and calculation of water use efficiency good et al 2014 both of which are essential for parameterizing and validating physical based ecosystem models wang et al 2015 7 conclusions in dryland ecosystems although et is the largest water loss flux it is poorly quantified especially at fine temporal scales despite the importance of accurately quantifying et its partitioning remains a major challenge for ecohydrologic studies in drylands to review and summarize the current state of knowledge on this topic we retrieved 31 publications on in situ studies of et partitioning covering the past nearly three decades we classified these studies by the length of time over which measurements were taken ranging from intermittent typically less than 10 days and usually done with the isotopic approach to longer term done at the growing season or annual scale and usually with the hydrometric approach for natural ecosystems results from the intermittent studies showed higher variability than those from the longer term studies longer term t et varied over a narrow range with a mean value of 0 52 implying that soil evaporation and plant transpiration are largely equivalent in natural drylands over the long term agro ecosystems usually irrigated exhibited a relatively higher t et and showed greater variability in the longer term measurements maximum values of t et were roughly similar for natural ecosystems and agro ecosystems soil evaporation and plant transpiration responded differently during dynamic wetting drying episodes both in timing and duration soil evaporation is more controlled by meteorological processes and shallow soil water whereas transpiration is more controlled by plant phenology and water availability in the rooting zone the patterns of et partitioning in drylands are influenced by multiple biometeorological factors including the temporal distribution of precipitation rainfall interception soil moisture recharging groundwater depth and vegetation development atmospheric conditions and stomatal conductance dominate et partitioning at diurnal scales while canopy phenology or lai and soil moisture dominate over longer timescales our regression analyses revealed that lai especially its mean values is an essential factor controlling t et variability in dryland ecosystems but its explanatory power might be curtailed by stomatal control under dry climatic conditions on the basis of our findings we suggest three promising areas of investigation to help meet the challenges of et partitioning in drylands 1 employment of laser spectroscopy for intensive isotopic sampling of water vapor in the vadose zone 2 improved identification and accurate quantification of the various pathways of water diffusion and 3 development of methods for upscaling measurements taken at incongruent spatial temporal scales owing to different research approaches hydrometric vs isotopic declaration of competing interest none

6282,in drylands evapotranspiration et is the dominant ecohydrologic process for this reason partitioning of et determining the relative importance of interception i soil evaporation e and plant transpiration t is critical but remains a challenge recently however advances in measurement technologies and data availability have triggered an upsurge in in situ studies focused on quantifying t et we carried out a meta analysis of 38 datasets drawn from 31 studies done in drylands worldwide this analysis showed that over the growing season e and t are roughly equivalent for most natural ecosystems whereas t et is higher in irrigated agro ecosystems with respect to factors controlling variations in t et we found 1 no clear correlation for annual precipitation soil texture or ecosystem type 2 leaf area index is a more significant controlling factor than fractional cover and 3 t et varies most during dynamic wetting drying episodes we also found that controlling factors are different for e and t because these two processes differ in temporal dynamics the factors controlling et partitioning vary with temporal scale further when interception and shallow groundwater are substantial including these factors is essential for accurate t et quantification the isotopic approach especially using laser spectroscopy is now indispensable for such studies however issues related to sampling protocols and quality assurance still must be resolved we propose three promising areas for future studies in drylands 1 isotopic sampling of vadose zone water vapor using laser spectroscopy 2 improved definition identification of diffusive pathways and 3 robust upscaling from incongruent hydrometric and isotopic measurements keywords drylands evapotranspiration partitioning hydrometric interception laser isotope spectroscopy leaf area index scaling evaporation transpiration stable isotope 1 introduction drylands cover about 40 of the global landmass and up to 44 of cultivated lands supporting 35 of the global population safriel et al 2006 drylands can be grouped into four categories according to level of aridity hyper arid arid semiarid and dry subhumid berry sandra et al 2006 sustainable and efficient management of these ecosystems requires an in depth understanding of the water cycle and especially of the evapotranspiration et component which typically accounts for 90 95 of annual precipitation kurc and small 2004 wilcox et al 2003 zhang et al 2011 the bulk et flux consists of interception evaporation i soil evaporation e and plant transpiration t partitioning of et determination of the relative importance of these constituent fluxes usually expressed as a ratio t et or e et is a challenging exercise but is essential for understanding dryland ecohydrology kool et al 2014 newman et al 2006 wang et al 2010 this rationale is well supported considering the following facts partitioning of et is critical for quantifying 1 water use efficiency lu et al 2017 williams et al 2004 2 ecosystem productivity brooks 2015 yepez et al 2003 and sustainability raz yaseef et al 2012 3 biological water demand and its influence on the hydrologic cycle newman et al 2006 and 4 the coupling of hydrologic and biogeochemical cycles austin et al 2004 jasechko 2018 wang et al 2012 partitioning of et is essential for calibrating and validating surface plant atmosphere transfer models braud et al 2005 kroes et al 2017 sutanto et al 2012 land surface models aouade et al 2016 wong et al 2017 and the land atmosphere interaction in climate models lawrence et al 2007 zhang et al 2016 the processes of i e and t differ not only in timing and duration dickinson et al 2003 but also with respect to the mechanisms involved in phase change the latter differences being responsible for the dissimilarities in stable isotope composition among these constituent fluxes savenije 2004 a clear understanding of et partitioning is especially crucial for sustainable management of water resources in drylands which are expected to be increasingly limited under climate change mounting demographic pressures and competition from many other socio economic sectors a fundamental strategy for reaching a sustainable level of agricultural water consumption is that of enhancing the productive component t and curtailing the unproductive component e falkenmark and rockström 2004 topics on et partitioning have been summarized in a few studies kool et al 2014 comprehensively reviewed methodologies available for et partitioning including both in situ measurement and modeling on the basis of 52 publications yakir and sternberg 2000 reviewed the isotopic approach for measuring gas exchange at the ecosystem level schlesinger and jasechko 2014 compiled 81 worldwide studies on et partitioning at the ecosystem scale and found that t et is relatively lower in semiarid ecosystems 51 15 for steppe desert and shrublands than in wet climates e g 70 14 for tropical forests wang et al 2014 synthesized the relationship between t et and leaf area index lai at a global scale on the basis of 48 published studies and wei et al 2017 further refined this relationship for different vegetation types to our knowledge however there has been no synthesis of what is known about et partitioning in drylands in this paper on the basis of a meta analysis of the pertinent in situ studies we discuss four topics relevant to et partitioning 1 the approaches and methodologies commonly used for field studies 2 the general trends in et partitioning in dryland ecosystems 3 emerging themes from the literature and 4 challenges and opportunities for future investigations 2 literature collection using the web of science core collection http apps webofknowledge com we searched for relevant peer reviewed journal articles published in english from 1987 to june 2018 we used mutated combinations of the following inquiry terms evapotranspiration and partition evaporation and transpiration dryland or water limited and semiarid or semi arid or arid we filtered the retrieved raw records 200 with the following criteria 1 quantitative separation of the et flux whether into two constituents e and t or three e t and i 2 major results obtained from in situ studies at the site or plot scale rather than from modeling or remote sensing at the regional scale and 3 at least two independent measurements in parallel of the three variables et e and t the outcome was the selection of 31 in situ studies from drylands across the world fig 1 which yielded 38 datasets tables 1 and 2 some studies scott and biederman 2017 yimam et al 2015 encompassed multiple ecosystems and or different treatments in which case we labeled each ecosystem treatment as a separate dataset if exact numeric values relevant to et partitioning were given only in graphs we extracted those values with engauge digitizer 10 4 mark mitchell engauge digitizer https github com markummitchell engauge digitizer as shown in figs 1 and 2 the great majority about 80 of the retrieved studies were conducted in semiarid climates whereas those done in hyper arid and subhumid climates account for only about 10 5 each category on the basis of the information provided in the original records we grouped the dryland ecosystems into the following eight types grassland savanna shrubland open woodland forest orchard cropland and marshland semiarid climate grasslands and shrublands are the two most common natural ecosystems each representing more than 15 agro ecosystems including croplands and orchards usually irrigated are also well represented 38 across the spectrum of climatic aridity the most common crops were winter wheat and maize table 2 3 approaches and methods used in the et partitioning studies following the practice of previous studies laudon et al 2004 sutanto et al 2014 we grouped the widely used in situ measurement methods for et partitioning into two overarching approaches hydrometric and isotopic fig 3 of the 31 published studies in our meta analysis 15 used mainly the hydrometric approach table 1 and 16 used mainly the isotopic approach table 2 however these two approaches are usually integrated for et partitioning especially at the ecosystem or larger scales good et al 2014 williams et al 2004 xiao et al 2018 3 1 hydrometric approach multiple hydrometric methods are available for measuring the bulk et flux or its constituents individually micro meteorological techniques such as bowen ratio energy budget and eddy covariance provide only an aggregate of et fluxes based on energy balance however multiple algebraic methods have been proposed that are capable of partitioning et via additional measurements such as ground surface temperature moran et al 2009 or gross ecosystem photosynthesis scott and biederman 2017 another recently proposed method for partitioning et is based on the assumption of flux variance similarity in high frequency eddy covariance data scanlon and kustas 2012 skaggs et al 2018 wang et al 2016b in addition zhou et al 2016 have proposed a concept called underlying water use efficiency uwue this concept estimates t et as a ratio of average over potential uwue by assuming that potential uwue is related to t and average uwue is related to et to obtain transpiration t xylem sap flow is commonly measured by various thermic techniques allen and grime 1995 burgess et al 2001 granier 1987 poyatos et al 2016 gas exchange chambers are also widely used to measure transpiration at smaller scales such as leaf or stem pearcy et al 2000 stannard and weltz 2006 yepez et al 2005 for soil evaporation e the micro lysimeter is an inexpensive and reliable tool when roots are excluded from the sampling soil column good et al 2014 this tool is especially popular and convenient for loose and shallow soils in irrigated croplands evaporation from canopy interception i is obtained by subtracting the sum of throughfall and stemflow from the measured above canopy precipitation five of our retrieved studies explicitly included measurements or calculations of interception mitchell et al 2009 raz yaseef et al 2010 wang and wang 2017 yaseef et al 2010 yimam et al 2015 these hydrometric methods are often used in combination to measure different constituents of the et flux at the site or plot scale table 1 or used for comparison with and validation of other methods perez priego et al 2017 widmoser and wohlfahrt 2018 3 2 isotopic approach water vapor from soil evaporation is usually lighter in isotopic composition than that from transpiration because during soil evaporation the liquid vapor phase change involves a strong fractionation process being a substantial factor in dryland ecosystems the isotopically lighter soil evaporation contrasts strongly with the isotopically heavier transpiration which facilitates the practical application of the isotopic approach good et al 2014 there are two major methodologies by which the isotopic approach is used one is the two source mixing model expressed as 1 t et δ et δ e δ t δ e where δ et is the isotopic composition of the aggregated et flux and δ e and δ t are the isotopic compositions of evaporation and transpiration respectively various techniques and measuring methods have been developed to quantify these three isotopic values table 2 and fig 3 for δ et the keeling plot method keeling 1958 yakir and sternberg 2000 and the flux gradient method griffis et al 2004 both based on isotopic sampling of atmospheric water vapor within the ecosystem boundary layer are widely used for δ e the craig gordon method craig and gordon 1965 horita et al 2008 has become a quasi standard method for δ t both steady state theory and non steady state theory are often used depending on the temporal resolution barnard et al 2006 flanagan and ehleringer 1991 wang and yakir 1995 the second methodology is isotopic mass balance under steady state conditions it can be simplified as 2 p δ p q δ q e δ e t δ t where p and δ p represent precipitation and its isotopic composition while q and δ q represent runoff and its isotopic composition this method has been applied at scales ranging from that of soil profile ferretti et al 2003 gaj et al 2016 to that of regional watershed guo et al 2017 the development of the isotopic approach has been thoroughly discussed elsewhere kool et al 2014 sutanto et al 2014 wang et al 2012 xiao et al 2018 yakir and sternberg 2000 zhang et al 2010 the isotopic approach requires extensive sampling of water from different reservoirs within the ecohydrologic cycle to study the isotopic dynamics of atmospheric water vapor cryogenic trapping systems barron gafford et al 2017 han et al 2006 helliker et al 2002 zhang et al 2011 have often been used however the trapping method involves a slow a few hours and laborious process of sample collection resulting in low temporal resolution and discreteness of the data series in contrast to such discrete snapshots field deployable laser spectroscopy has become increasingly popular for its ability to directly sample atmospheric water vapor and to measure the isotopic composition with high temporal resolution and an accuracy comparable with that of traditional isotope ratio mass spectroscopy berman et al 2013 these laser instruments greatly expand the applicability of stable water isotopologues in ecohydrologic studies wang et al 2012 for the 16 studies using the isotopic approach table 2 14 studies used the single isotope method either 2h or 18o and only two gaj et al 2016 yepez et al 2003 used the double single isotope method 2h and 18o simultaneously the 2h method is preferable for estimating δ et owing to its high sensitivity aouade et al 2016 in terms of labeling two studies used artificially labeled water for et partitioning good et al 2014 yepez et al 2005 and one used injection of deuterated water into the groundwater to separate the sourcing depths for transpiration balugani et al 2017 3 3 application of the hydrometric and isotopic approaches in dryland ecosystems the in situ studies reported on in our 31 retrieved publications made extensive use of the hydrometric and isotopic approaches fig 4 a the measurement periods vary dramatically from one study to another ranging from one day yepez et al 2003 zhang et al 2011 to the length of the growing season or even a full year tables 1 and 2 the shorter term investigations most not exceeding 10 days were classified as intermittent studies these typically were carried out with the isotopic approach owing to the need for extensive sampling and close human monitoring in only two isotopic studies in croplands were measurements taken throughout the growing season lu et al 2017 wen et al 2016 long term investigations at either the growing season or the annual scale are typically carried out with the hydrometric approach one hydrometric study even used climatic records covering more than a decade scott and biederman 2017 4 general trends in et partitioning in dryland ecosystems comparison of long term annual mean precipitation fig 4b soil texture fig 4c and ecosystem types fig 5 a reveals no clear trends in et partitioning results from longer term investigations growing season or annual scale show that in natural ecosystems evaporation and transpiration are largely equivalent whereas in agro ecosystems usually irrigated the transpiration fraction is relatively higher fig 5a results for t et from the longer term studies in natural ecosystems showed less variability 0 37 0 84 mean value standard deviation of 0 52 0 13 n 13 than those from the intermittent studies 0 06 0 85 mean value standard deviation of 0 47 0 34 n 9 the 0 06 minimum value for one of the intermittent studies was observed in an open woodland 7 plant coverage under dry summer conditions balugani et al 2017 indicating that t et is lower for woodlands with sparse vegetation canopies agro ecosystems showed higher t et with intermittent measurements ranging from 0 46 to 0 78 mean value of 0 65 0 13 n 5 and longer term measurements from 0 44 to 0 90 mean value of 0 66 0 17 n 9 maximum t et values are similar for natural ecosystems and agro ecosystems with the exception of open woodlands namely around 0 75 0 85 which agree with the maximum values of 0 72 0 90 found at the global scale for natural and agricultural systems characterized by low lai wang et al 2014 no general trends were identified in the relationship between plant fractional cover and ecosystem type fig 5b whereas lai means and maximums showed higher values in agro ecosystems than in natural ones fig 5c the linear regression between converted t et and plant canopy characteristics revealed that mean and maximum lai values explained 45 and 37 respectively of the variations in t et whereas plant fractional cover failed to be an effective explanatory variable fig 6 all values in fig 6 are log transformed because of the power law relationship between t et and the vegetation canopy parameters see eq 3 in section 5 6 statistically the regression was strongly significant for mean lai p value 0 01 and significant for maximum lai p value 0 05 however the coefficient of determination r 2 reported in this analysis is relatively low table 3 implying that the explanatory power of lai for t et variability is constrained in dryland ecosystems 5 major themes identified via the meta analysis 5 1 et partitioning during dynamic wetting drying episodes the pattern of rare and irregular precipitation events that characterizes dryland ecosystems creates pulses of high and low biotic activity snyder and tartowski 2006 consequently during the dynamic wetting and drying cycles both plant transpiration and soil evaporation can undergo rapid changes yepez et al 2005 soil evaporation is negligible when soils are dry but after precipitation it becomes significant within a short period usually a few days hu et al 2014 wang et al 2016a wang and yakir 2000 then once it has peaked evaporation declines rapidly transpiration which is suppressed during rainfall evett et al 2012 peaks more slowly and also declines more gradually after precipitation scott et al 2006 because of the differences in temporal dynamics between soil evaporation and transpiration the pattern of et partitioning varies significantly during these wetting drying episodes as examples a study of a semiarid forest found that soil evaporation dominated et shortly after a rain event with e et ranging between 49 and 65 gaj et al 2016 a study of a semiarid shrubland with more than 90 coverage showed that daily average e et decreased from 34 to 3 during the first two sunny days after precipitation xu et al 2008 and in a chihuahuan desert evaporation dominated et at the onset of summer rains but 2 4 weeks after the occurrence of large precipitation events shrub vegetation recovered and began to transpire at peak rates cavanaugh et al 2011 scott and biederman 2017 scott et al 2006 similar phenomena were often observed for irrigated agro ecosystems examples include a winter wheat field where e et was 0 20 before irrigation and 0 31 after irrigation aouade et al 2016 an olive olea europaea l orchard where e et was nearly 0 prior to irrigation then reached 0 31 by midday on the sixth day following irrigation williams et al 2004 and a cotton cropland where e et equaled or exceeded t et for four days after irrigation but began a dramatic decrease from the fifth day ham et al 1990 in contrast to this trend of increasing e et shortly after irrigation an exception was reported for a semiarid sparse grassland eragrostis lehmanniana with loamy sandy soil where e et dropped following the irrigation pulse in such environments soil evaporation is typically the dominant flux and transpiration the minor flux but with the rapid infiltration of irrigation water causing a short period of plant available soil water in the rooting zone transpiration increased briefly the corresponding decrease in e et to 0 57 0 65 occurred within three days after irrigation by day 7 e et had again risen to 0 78 yepez et al 2005 5 2 factors controlling evaporation and transpiration are different evaporation and transpiration are controlled by different factors soil evaporation is a physical process mostly affected by abiotic factors including vapor pressure deficit vpd water availability in the surface soil and the shading effect of the vegetation canopy plant transpiration on the other hand takes place through the soil plant atmosphere continuum and is controlled by both abiotic and biotic factors including plant available soil water in the rooting zone vpd and physiological regulation of leaf stomata a study of an olive orchard olea europaea l showed that during wetting drying cycles daily rates of soil evaporation correlated positively with daily vpd but transpiration did not williams et al 2004 seasonal scale investigations in a semiarid eucalyptus woodland found that daily rates of transpiration tracked seasonal changes in radiation and drainage whereas daily rates of evaporation correlated positively with surface soil moisture content mitchell et al 2009 similar results were found in a semiarid shrubland cavanaugh et al 2011 and a pine forest raz yaseef et al 2012 where soil evaporation was closely correlated with solar radiation and surface soil moisture whereas transpiration was correlated with soil moisture in the deeper layers this difference the dependence of evaporation on shallow soil moisture and of transpiration on deeper soil moisture was also observed in agro ecosystems zhang et al 2011 5 3 controlling factors differ according to temporal scale the factors controlling et partitioning vary at different temporal scales ambient atmospheric conditions show high variability at the diurnal scale whereas plant phenology exhibits great variations across the growing season especially with changes in the precipitation pattern dry vs wet for example in a study of a semiarid grassland hu et al 2014 found that vpd was a significant factor at the diurnal scale resulting in a u shaped diurnal pattern of t et a similar diurnal t et pattern was found in another dryland grassland but over the longer timescale of a two week period of green up and senescence green lai and available soil water were the controlling factors for t et dynamics good et al 2014 for semiarid sites characterized by summer rainfall t et reached a peak coincident with the maximum lai suggesting the strong effect of plant phenology and precipitation pattern on et partitioning scott and biederman 2017 similarly a modeling study in grassland ecosystems concluded that t et was controlled by canopy stomatal conductance at the diurnal scale and by lai at the seasonal and annual scales hu et al 2009 5 4 effects of precipitation and soil moisture dynamics on et partitioning how et is partitioned in a given ecosystem depends on the temporal pattern of precipitation distribution whether precipitation is concentrated into a few big events or scattered among many smaller ones huxman et al 2004 scott and biederman 2017 for example a study conducted in a semiarid forest found that annual t et was more influenced by large storms 30 mm than by the annual precipitation totals raz yaseef et al 2012 probably because only intense storms can result in deep infiltration and thus plant available soil moisture for trees a similar phenomenon was observed in semiarid grasslands and shrublands in arizona usa where seasonal t et was found to be relatively insensitive to precipitation patterns when precipitation was near to below normal moran et al 2009 conditions under which deep soil water infiltration probably rarely occurred 5 5 effects of interception on et partitioning uncertainty concerning the contribution of interception is the largest source of bias in et partitioning wei et al 2017 the amount of rainfall intercepted by the vegetation canopy and the debris layer depends on rainfall frequency and the structural characteristics and physiological properties of the vegetation in arid and semiarid climates sporadic and short precipitation events coupled with high vpd could result in a substantial amount of evaporation via interception laio et al 2001 examples include a semiarid eucalyptus e capillosa woodland where 8 15 of the rainfall was intercepted of which 69 evaporated and 31 was yielded as stem flow mitchell et al 2009 and a semiarid pine forest where interception accounted for 10 12 of annual precipitation and more than 20 during the rainy season raz yaseef et al 2010 raz yaseef et al 2012 in contrast interception could be negligible in sparsely vegetated dryland ecosystems such as a desert shrubland in northern china where interception accounted for only 3 2 of precipitation during the growing season zhao et al 2016 5 6 effects of vegetation canopy on et partitioning several researchers noted that patterns of et partitioning are influenced by the various characteristics of the vegetation canopy such as lai and fractional cover wang et al 2010 phenological development during the growing season montoro et al 2016 and tree age wang and wang 2017 studies of the relationship between lai and t et at the global scale wang et al 2014 wei et al 2017 suggest that lai can be the first order controlling factor for t et as expressed in the following power law function 3 t e t a l a i b where coefficients a and b are specific to vegetation types see table 3 for results from the retrieved studies and several other pertinent investigations it has been argued that this power law function applies only to situations in which lai is below a certain threshold below that threshold t et increases quickly and proportionally in response to increases in lai but above it t et is no longer sensitive to changes in lai for example an lai threshold of 4 was found for a cropland of winter wheat and summer corn wang and liu 2007 and a threshold of approximately 2 7 for a cotton and sorghum site ritchie and burnett 1971 this threshold phenomenon may be attributable to suppression of transpiration per unit of lai for well developed or thickened plant canopy a simulation based on tree mosaics also revealed that as lai increased t et gradually fell below a 1 1 proportionality villegas et al 2015 the retrieved datasets show a high variability in t et a range of 0 06 0 90 fig 4b c and fig 5a wide variations in t et were also reported at a global scale for ecosystems with low lai e g 0 5 indicating the possibility of high t et even under low lai conditions wang et al 2014 a modeling study of grassland ecosystems also revealed that the relationship between t et and lai is more erratic in semiarid and subhumid sites than in humid sites hu et al 2009 this greater variation in t et for low lai ecosystems implies that other biological or meteorological factors might play a substantial role for example in a semiarid steppe region of inner mongolia china in a year with normal precipitation t et decreased under grazing because of the reduction in lai wang et al 2016a in contrast in a dry year the grazing induced reduction in lai did not influence t et because plant physiological functions were suppressed by the drought conditions 5 7 effects of groundwater on et partitioning for sites with shallow groundwater depths of 0 10 m groundwater evaporation and root water uptake should be explicitly considered for example in an oak savanna groundwater uptake by blue oak accounted for 70 90 of total et during the dry summer miller et al 2010 in a semiarid floodplain woodland the ability of the dominant deep rooted velvet mesquite prosopis velutina to access groundwater contributed to an unusually high t et ratio 0 90 during the growing season yepez et al 2007 similarly in a desert shrubland groundwater lying about 5 7 m below the surface became the main source for both evaporation and transpiration zhao et al 2016 and in a semiarid open woodland evaporation of shallow groundwater accounted for up to one third of total et but only after soil moisture in the vadose zone had been depleted balugani et al 2017 6 emerging technologies challenges and opportunities our understanding of et fluxes and partitioning of et in drylands has advanced dramatically in the past few decades owing to enhanced capabilities in measurement technologies data availability and numerical modeling at the same time the particular nature of ecohydrologic processes in drylands especially the heterogeneity in spatial temporal scales means that et partitioning in these regions remains challenging 6 1 field deployable isotopic laser spectroscopy for water vapor analysis the isotopic approach for et partitioning is continuing to evolve the methods traditionally used for sampling water from soils and plants have major limitations such as 1 the destructive nature of sampling and 2 the laborious and time consuming procedure of cryogenic vacuum distillation in addition the isotopic representativeness of plant samples remains debatable cernusak et al 2016 roden et al 2000 rothfuss and javaux 2017 for drylands a special challenge is that under very dry conditions the negligible flux of soil evaporation might prevent reliable calculation of δ et because of the absence of detectable vertical gradients in vapor concentrations and in the isotopic compositions of water vapor yepez et al 2005 extreme conditions of heat and aridity will decrease the equilibrium fractionation factor horita et al 2008 rendering the end members δ e and δ t insufficiently distinguishable lu et al 2017 which translates to a high degree of uncertainty for the isotopic approach a critical question in quantifying the isotopic composition of soil evaporation is how fractionation processes affect the isotopic composition of soil water gaj et al 2016 which under conditions of intense evaporation exhibits high variability across the profile hu et al 2014 during the dry season vapor transport can dominate water diffusion in the vadose zone and plays a key role in mass and energy transfer within soils bittelli et al 2008 deb et al 2011 to determine the effects of fractionation processes then isotopic sampling of water vapor across the soil profile is essential balugani et al 2017 a promising tool for sampling of soil water vapor in the vadose zone is field deployable laser isotope spectroscopy which enables direct continuous and non destructive measurement gaj et al 2016 herbstritt et al 2012 oerter et al 2017 in situ sampling of soil water vapor has been performed both to study water vapor dynamics gaj et al 2016 oerter et al 2017 soderberg et al 2012 volkmann and weiler 2014 and to derive the isotopic composition of liquid soil water based on the water vapor equilibrium assumption herbstritt et al 2012 this assumption is supported by a case study in a semiarid african savanna where the liquid vapor interface was measured in situ in the soil profile soderberg et al 2012 the major concern during sampling of soil water vapor for isotopic analysis is fractionation caused by either inducing evaporation of liquid soil water or condensation of vapor inside the sampling apparatus soderberg et al 2012 at present standard sampling protocols with wide applicability are still under development stumpp et al 2018 6 2 water diffusion pathways from ground to atmosphere to be consistent and comparable in situ studies on et partitioning must identify and take into account the various diffusive pathways by which water moves from terrestrial ecosystems to the near surface atmosphere in the past many field studies ignored the role of evaporation underneath the canopy considering it to be negligible because of the shading effect balugani et al 2017 an accurate quantification of under canopy evaporation necessitates the application of either an extinction coefficient for radiation diffusion or a threshold lai value wang and liu 2007 for two layered ecosystems e g savannas and shrublands even though transpiration fluxes can be combined to simplify analysis xu et al 2008 transpiration from the upper tree shrub layer and from the understory herbaceous layer should be measured separately wei et al 2017 such detailed in situ studies are essential for quantifying the different diffusive pathways for plant transpiration and for identifying the biophysical factors that control transpiration from different functional types dubbert et al 2014 6 3 scaling and modeling dryland ecosystems characterized by scarce and sporadic precipitation as well as low vegetation coverage exhibit considerable spatial heterogeneity along with high temporal variability in plant physiological activity newman et al 2010 raz yaseef et al 2012 villegas et al 2014 for these reasons upscaling of measurements from the stand or plot scale is quite challenging for example upscaling of sap flow is highly uncertain and error prone first because the scaling relationships for different parameters basal area plant density canopy height canopy coverage sapwood area lai vary widely poyatos et al 2016 and second because plants of different functional types have different phenological stages wang et al 2014 yepez et al 2003 when sap flow is being compared with et fluxes obtained by eddy covariance measurement the upscaling needs to be confined to the contributing footprints of the turbulent fluxes williams et al 2004 coupling of the eddy covariance method with laser isotope spectroscopy could make it possible for ecosystem level et partitioning to be accomplished without the need for scaling ferretti et al 2003 williams et al 2004 xiao et al 2018 in addition this combined methodology can be expanded to measurement of carbon isotopes thereby enabling the partition of co2 dynamics and calculation of water use efficiency good et al 2014 both of which are essential for parameterizing and validating physical based ecosystem models wang et al 2015 7 conclusions in dryland ecosystems although et is the largest water loss flux it is poorly quantified especially at fine temporal scales despite the importance of accurately quantifying et its partitioning remains a major challenge for ecohydrologic studies in drylands to review and summarize the current state of knowledge on this topic we retrieved 31 publications on in situ studies of et partitioning covering the past nearly three decades we classified these studies by the length of time over which measurements were taken ranging from intermittent typically less than 10 days and usually done with the isotopic approach to longer term done at the growing season or annual scale and usually with the hydrometric approach for natural ecosystems results from the intermittent studies showed higher variability than those from the longer term studies longer term t et varied over a narrow range with a mean value of 0 52 implying that soil evaporation and plant transpiration are largely equivalent in natural drylands over the long term agro ecosystems usually irrigated exhibited a relatively higher t et and showed greater variability in the longer term measurements maximum values of t et were roughly similar for natural ecosystems and agro ecosystems soil evaporation and plant transpiration responded differently during dynamic wetting drying episodes both in timing and duration soil evaporation is more controlled by meteorological processes and shallow soil water whereas transpiration is more controlled by plant phenology and water availability in the rooting zone the patterns of et partitioning in drylands are influenced by multiple biometeorological factors including the temporal distribution of precipitation rainfall interception soil moisture recharging groundwater depth and vegetation development atmospheric conditions and stomatal conductance dominate et partitioning at diurnal scales while canopy phenology or lai and soil moisture dominate over longer timescales our regression analyses revealed that lai especially its mean values is an essential factor controlling t et variability in dryland ecosystems but its explanatory power might be curtailed by stomatal control under dry climatic conditions on the basis of our findings we suggest three promising areas of investigation to help meet the challenges of et partitioning in drylands 1 employment of laser spectroscopy for intensive isotopic sampling of water vapor in the vadose zone 2 improved identification and accurate quantification of the various pathways of water diffusion and 3 development of methods for upscaling measurements taken at incongruent spatial temporal scales owing to different research approaches hydrometric vs isotopic declaration of competing interest none

6283,this study deals with the sensitivity of advective contaminant travel time to soil hydraulic parameters through a heterogeneous soil profile which is often required in many applications such as designing a monitoring network developing a remediation strategy for contaminated sites and determining the associated risks of subsurface contamination the main objective is to determine relative contributions to the output uncertainty of advective travel time from individual input stochastic hydraulic parameters a new approach is developed to examine the sensitivity of advective contaminant travel time to saturated hydraulic conductivity and macroscopic capillary drive as a result of infiltration from a wet and contaminated surface source the approach can be applied to both non stationary layered formation and stationary soil profile the results demonstrate that the advective contaminant travel time is sensitive to the layers with small saturated hydraulic conductivity and small macroscopic capillary drive values larger uncertainty of saturated hydraulic conductivity and macroscopic capillary drive shifts the sensitive layers to the advective travel time to deeper layers correlation range of saturated hydraulic conductivity and macroscopic capillary drive has less significant impact on the sensitivity of advective contaminant travel time than the standard deviation in the stationary saturated hydraulic conductivity and macroscopic capillary drive profile although the advective contaminant travel time increase significantly for fine textured soil compared to coarse textured soil the fractional contribution of spatial locations to the overall uncertainty of total advective travel time is virtually identical for both fine textured and coarse textured soils keywords sensitivity analysis advective contaminant travel time unsaturated heterogeneous soil saturated hydraulic conductivity macroscopic capillary drive 1 introduction sensitivity analysis of flow and contaminant transport in unsaturated zone is important for environmental regulation and remediation design in general the sensitivity analysis quantifies variation of outputs from unsaturated flow and transport models due to changes in model input parameters or other model components such as boundaries and model structures in modeling natural unsaturated zones input parameters are usually treated as uncertain due to heterogeneity and lack of characterizations and knowledge one main objective of sensitivity analysis is to determine relative contributions to the output uncertainties in the quantities of interest from individual input parameters in flow and contaminant transport modeling in this study a new approach is developed to quantify the sensitivity of advective contaminant travel time to soil hydraulic parameters through an unsaturated heterogeneous formation the advective contaminant travel time is determined by wetting front propagation as water infiltrates into soils under wet surface conditions natural soil profiles in the vertical direction are heterogeneous typically in a layered formation with varying hydraulic properties among layers due to natural evolutions assouline 2013 mohammadzadeh habili and heidarpour 2015 the green ampt ga model green and ampt 1911 was one of the earliest infiltration models introduced to describe water infiltration process in unsaturated soil the ga model was developed based on the assumption of rectangular saturated piston wetting front into soil profiles gowdish and muñoz carpena 2009 which means the infiltration is dominantly advective in nature the ga model has been widely used in many numerical hydrological models arnold et al 2012 flanagan et al 2007 rossman 2015 scharffenberg 2015 previous studies have extended the ga model to describe water infiltration process in layered soils chu and mariño 2005 ma et al 2011 in the ga approach the effective hydraulic conductivity ke used in the model is critical and should be carefully determined since the infiltration rate is highly dependent on this parameter in the original ga model green and ampt 1911 treated ke to be the same as the saturated hydraulic conductivity ks several studies suggested however that ke can be taken as smaller than ks due to the air content in soil e g king et al 1999 liu et al 2011 several other studies have shown that ke varies with soil texture air entrapment soil moisture condition and duration of the rainfall lv et al 2015 ma et al 2015 ranging from 0 7ks to ks in the recent study of cui and zhu 2017 the guidelines were established to evaluate ke from comparisons with the numerical solutions of the richards equation performed through hydrus 1d simunek et al 2013 the effective ks was inversely optimized by matching wetting front travel time to saturate the entire soil profile with that from the richard s equation guidelines to select ke were established under 198 scenarios with various soil types overland flow depths and layer formations cui and zhu 2017 depending on the layer configurations and soil textures ke was found to be in the range of 0 6ks to 1 1ks in other words the effective hydraulic conductivity in the ga approach should be in general smaller than ks this study deals with the sensitivity of advective contaminant travel time to soil hydraulic parameters which is often required in many applications such as designing a monitoring network developing a remediation strategy and determining the associated risks of subsurface contamination sensitivity analysis methods can be divided into global sensitivity analysis gsa and local sensitivity analysis lsa gsa methods consider the interaction among different parameters by changing multiple model parameters simultaneously cibin et al 2010 widely used gsa methods include regression analysis morris screening sobol s methods fourier amplitude sensitivity test and regional sensitivity analysis bilotta et al 2012 gamerith et al 2013 mishra et al 2009 morris 1991 norton 2015 olaya abril et al 2017 wang et al 2013 on the other hand lsa methods such as the one variable at a time and the differential analysis method do not take into account the interaction among parameters and therefore are not as efficient as the gsa methods helton 1993 helton and davis 2003 saltelli et al 2000 provided a list of many sensitivity analysis methods regarding sensitivity analysis of advective contaminant travel time several previous studies investigated the advective travel time and its sensitivity to the aquifer parameters such as the hydraulic conductivity for saturated groundwater flows zhu et al 2010 zhu 2012 2018 in this study a new approach is developed to quantify the sensitivity of advective contaminant travel time to soil hydraulic parameters through unsaturated heterogeneous soils in particular both ks and macroscopic capillary drive of unsaturated soil s are treated as uncertain and spatially correlated parameters the basic concept of ga model is used to relate the advective contaminant travel to ks and s as discussed earlier the ga model has been tested extensively and found to be reasonable in determining the advective contaminant travel time into unsaturated soils the developed approach is particularly useful in applications when estimations of contaminant travel times in unsaturated soil are needed but a full advection dispersion contaminant transport models are not available to determine the advective travel time due to infiltration into a heterogeneous unsaturated layered soil the general framework of the ga approach is used by neglecting the dispersion component in adopting the ga approach a relatively high value of effective hydraulic conductivity of ke ks is used as a result the estimated advective travel time is on the conservative side in that using a higher value for the ke will result in a smaller advective travel time i e faster contaminant travel it should be pointed out however that the developed sensitivity analysis approach can be used for any ke values if a smaller ke is used the mean advective travel time through the profile will be longer the conclusions related to the advective travel time sensitivity however should remain the same since the sensitivity is mainly related to the ke uncertainty after the advective travel time through each layer is determined the portion of advective travel time variance i e uncertainty contributed by each layer is quantitatively assessed through the covariance between the total advective travel time through the entire heterogeneous profile and the portion of travel time through that layer the sensitivity of advective travel time to the mean standard deviation and correlation range of the input stochastic hydraulic parameters as well as soil layer arrangement i e how the soil textures in different layers change with depth is then examined and discussed 2 methods 2 1 advective travel time through layered soil in this study the main variable of interest for sensitivity analysis is the advective travel time into a layered and unsaturated soil profile a schematic diagram of infiltration into a heterogeneous layered soil profile is shown in fig 1 in the ga approach it is assumed that the infiltration is advective in nature and the soil profile behind the wetting front is always saturated by using the darcy s law one has 1 df dt k s 1 s z where f is the total infiltration depth t is the time ks is the saturated hydraulic conductivity s is the macroscopic capillary drive morel seytoux and khanji 1974 1975 morel seytoux et al 1996 z is the wetting front depth from the ground surface the total infiltration depth f is related to the wetting front depth by the moisture deficit θs θ0 f z θs θ0 where θs is the saturated water content and θ0 is the initial water content substituting this relationship into eq 1 one has 2 θ s θ 0 dz dt k s z s z eq 2 can be solved under the initial condition z t 0 0 which can be expressed as 3 z s l n z s s k s θ s θ 0 t when the wetting front is at the interface between layer 1 and layer 2 i e z1 l1 eq 3 can be used to determine the

be determined by the continuity requirement of infiltration rate at the interface the overall hydraulic conductivity for the i 1 saturated layers above layer i is simply the harmonic mean of saturated hydraulic conductivities of all i 1 layers and can be written as 5 k e i 1 k 1 i 1 z k z k 1 k 1 i 1 z k z k 1 k sk z i 1 k 1 i 1 z k z k 1 k sk the continuity equation at the interface can be written

relation to z and dz and then integrate dt from ti 1 to ti and dz from zi 1 to zi to determine the advective travel time from zi 1 to zi which is layer i cui and zhu 2017 13 t i θ si θ 0 i l i k si k

in each layer and the total advective travel time in eqs 13 and 14 the portion of total advective travel time variance i e uncertainty contributed by layer i can be quantitatively assessed through the covariance cov between the total advective travel time through the entire heterogeneous profile and the portion of advective travel time through layer i which is the sensitivity index si of advective

condition θ0 and layer thickness l i e 5 total stochastic parameters may be all uncertain and stochastic in the following however it is assumed that the initial moisture deficit θs θ0 and layer thickness l are given and deterministic for subsequent analysis and discussion of quantitative results it should be emphasized that the developed approach is applicable to the scenarios where all 5

through a9 in the appendix the formulas expressed in eqs 15 through 19 along with eqs a1 through a9 represent the framework of determining the sensitivity of advective travel time to ks and s due to infiltration from saturated surface source into an initially relatively dry layer soil profile when ks and s are stochastic to proceed further in quantifying and examining the sensitivity of advective travel time to ks and s one needs to prescribe the probability distributions of the uncertain parameters ks and s which will be discussed in the following section 2 3 hydraulic property model and hydraulic parameter probability density distribution the macroscopic capillary drive s is often used in quantifying unsaturated flow from a relatively wet source into a dry soil and can be expressed as follows 20 s 1 k s 0 k ψ d ψ where k is the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity function ψ is the suction head of unsaturated soil while any unsaturated hydraulic conductivity function can be used to calculate s parameter in eq 20 the widely used van genuchten hydraulic conductivity function van genuchten 1980 which was developed by combining the van genuchten soil water retention function with the pore size distribution model of mualem 1976 is adopted to represent the k ψ function 21 k ψ k s 1 α ψ mn 1 α ψ n m 2 1 α ψ n m 2 where α is the pore size distribution parameter n and m are the parameters that determine the shape of the soil water retention curve and can often be related by m 1 1 n using eq 21 s can be approximated as morel seytoux et al 1996 zhu et al 2004 22 s 1 α 0 046 m 2 07 m 2 19 5 m 3 1 4 7 m 16 m 2 from the van genuchten parameters for 12 major soil textural groups according to the study by carsel and parrish 1988 one can calculate s for each soil group fig 2 shows the scatter plot of ln ks and ln s based on these 12 major soil groups from carsel and parrish 1988 it can be seen that lnks and lns are not correlated with the correlation coefficient of only about 0 16 so ln ks and ln s are assumed to be uncorrelated to further simplify the analysis the ks has been reported to follow a lognormal probability distribution nielsen et al 1973 smith and diekkruger 1996 23 f k k s 1 k s σ y 2 π e x p l n k s μ y 2 2 σ y 2 k s 0 where μ y is estimated from the sample mean of lnks ln k s and σ y from the sample standard deviation of lnks slnks for a lognormally distributed ks y lnks is then normally distributed although a commonly used lognormal distribution is used for the hydraulic conductivity to illustrate the method and present some quantitative results to facilitate discussion the developed approach is applicable to any probability distributions of ks and s with known marginal and joint distributions a similar log normal probability density function is also used for the distribution of s 24 f s s 1 s σ z 2 π e x p l n s μ z 2 2 σ z 2 s 0 where μ z is estimated from the sample mean of lns lns and σ z from the sample standard deviation of lns slns similarly z lns is normally distributed although it can be assumed that ks and s are not correlated the ks and s could be auto correlated spatially the bivariate lognormal probability density function pdf of ksi exp yi and ksj exp yj can be obtained as aitchison and brown 1957 yue 2002 25 f 1 k si k sj 1 2 π k si k sj σ y i σ y j 1 ρ 1 2 e x p 1 2 1 ρ 1 2 ln k

through a9 can be further developed they are listed in eqs a10 through a18 in the appendix for illustration purposes an exponentially decayed correlation function zhu and satish 2001 is used ρ i e x p ξ d i where ξ is the lag and di is the correlation range of lnks when i 1 or lns when i 2 the developed sensitivity approach can be used in any layer configurations it can be used for either non stationary layered heterogeneous profile where ks and s may have different statistics in different layers it can also be used for stationary profile where ks and s may have the same statistics for the entire profile to account for uncertainties the ks and s in different layers or segments may also be auto correlated in the following section several illustrative cases for both non stationary layered and stationary profile are presented and discussed 2 4 validation of travel time and uncertainty calculations to validate the contaminant travel time and the associated uncertainty formulations the developed analytical approach is compared with numerical solutions for the portion related to contaminant travel time and its uncertainty the hydrus 1d simunek et al 2013 is used in conjunction with the latin hypercube sampling lhs method mckay et al 1979 for contaminant travel time calculation and uncertainty quantification the mean travel time in each layer can be calculated based on the analytical formulation of eq 13 as follows 29 e t i θ si θ 0 i l i e 1 k si k 1 i l k e 1 k sk e l n 1 l i z i 1 s i e 1 k si e z i s i l n 1 l i z i 1 s i the expectation terms e in the above equation can be calculated based on the given probability density functions for ks and s in eqs 23 and 24 the lhs is used to generate 200 random values for the ks and s parameters for each layer in the random sampling based on given probability density functions the lhs ensures that the generated random samples span the full coverage of a random variable even the sample size is relatively small this property of lhs reduces the computational cost of monte carlo simulations based on random sampling for the hydrus 1d simulations the layer profile is discretized into 500 segments and a saturated top boundary condition and a free drainage bottom boundary condition are used for each lhs realization of the ks and s for the uncorrelated ks and s parameters of each layer from the calculated 200 contaminant travel times for each layer the mean contaminant travel times for all the layers can be determined then the comparison can be made between the analytical mean travel times and the numerical ones for all the layers 3 results in the following the effects of the soil layer arrangement coefficient of variation cv and autocorrelation range of both ks and s on the sensitivity of advective contaminant travel time to ks and s are examined using a few selected soil textural groups from carsel and parrish 1988 table 1 lists the van genuchten hydraulic parameters for the selected five soil textural groups in the non stationary layered formation two layer arrangements i e how the soil textures in layers change with depth are examined where the mean ks increases and decrease with depth respectively table 2 shows the comparison results of mean travel times in all layers for the 5 layer profile with increasing ks with depth i e in the flow direction for the case of ks and s being uncorrelated two cases of cv of ks and s of 1 and 4 are used it can be seen that the analytical and numerical results agree very well with largest percent error of 6 5 for comparison the results of travel time based on the simple arithmetic average of ks and s parameters being substituted into eq 13 are also included in table 2 which shows that the errors of using these simplistic average parameters can introduce large errors of under estimation of over 80 in the contaminant travel time therefore the analytical approach of uncertainty quantification in this study is acceptable while using average hydraulic parameters to predict average travel time may produce large errors after validation of the uncertainty analysis portion of the developed approach the main focus of sensitivity analysis results are presented in the following for a few representative cases on the left panel of fig 3 i e fig 3 a and 3 c the sensitivity results of advective contaminant travel time to ks and s are shown for the two different layer arrangements the mean fraction of advective travel time through each corresponding layer based on the mean ks and s is shown on the right panel i e fig 3 b and 3 d for the top two figures fig 3 a and 3 b the 5 layers are arranged with increasing mean ks with depth i e arrangement 1 shown in table 1 while the two bottom figures fig 3 c and 3 d show the results for layer arrangement with decreasing mean ks with depth i e arrangement 2 shown in table 1 for the layer arrangement with low ks layers on top shown in fig 3 a the main controlling layer to the advective contaminant travel time is the top layer as the travel time fraction is larger than the thickness fraction of that layer seen in fig 3 b when the thickness fraction of the first fine soil layer decreases from 0 6 to 0 4 the sensitivity of this layer is virtually unchanged however the second layer becomes more significant to the uncertainty of total advective contaminant travel time with an increased sensitivity index fig 4 shows the sensitivity indices and the mean fractions of advective contaminant travel time based on the mean values of ks and s as functions of cv of ks for two the different layer arrangements in fig 4 and later figures a relatively large range of ks and or s cvs of 1 31 to 7 32 is used to investigate the effects of ks and or s uncertainties fig 4 a and 4 b plot the results for arrangement 1 shown in table 1 while fig 4 c and 4 d plot those for arrangement 2 respectively for a log normally distributed ks and s the mean ks and s increase with the cvs of ks and s while the mean value of ks increases with the cvs of ks the fraction of advective travel time in each layer does not change with the change of the cvs of ks as shown in fig 4 b and fig 4 d however the actual advective travel time decreases with the increase of the cv of ks in each layer to the same extent which results in the same mean fractions of advective travel time in each layer for different cv values of ks fig 5 shows the sensitivity indices and the mean advective contaminant travel time based on the mean values of ks and s as functions of the cv of s for the two different layer arrangements similar to figs 4 5 a and 5 b plot the sensitivity indices and mean advective contaminant travel times for arrangement 1 shown in table 1 while fig 5 c and 5 d plot those results for arrangement 2 the impact of the cv of s on the advective travel time in each layer is different from the cv of ks in this case even though the mean value of s is increased by a same factor for different layers the impact of this factor increase on the actual advective travel time is different at different layers since its impact on the advective travel time is mainly reflected by a secondary non linear ks s term fig 6 shows the sensitivity indices and the mean advective contaminant travel time based on the mean values of ks and s as functions of the correlation range of lnks for two different layer arrangements similar to figs 4 and 5 6 a and 6 b plot the sensitivity indices and mean advective contaminant travel times for arrangement 1 while fig 6 c and 6 d plot those for arrangement 2 obviously the mean values of ks and s are independent of the correlation range of ln ks as a result the correlation range of ln ks does not affect the mean advective travel time fraction in each layer that is only related to the mean ks and s seen in fig 6 b and 6 d fig 7 shows the sensitivity indices and mean advective travel time fractions based on the mean values of ks and s for the stationary ks and s profile at a few selected values of cvs of ks and s fig 7 a and 7 b are respectively for the results of sensitivity index and mean advective travel time fraction based on the mean values of ks and s for sand while fig 7 c and 7 d plot those for silty clay loam the correlation range for both ln ks and ln s is 1 0 with the increase of cvs of ks and s both the mean values of ks and s increase by a factor that is related to the cv values of ks and s the advective travel time is linearly proportional to ks a uniform increase in mean ks decreases the advective travel time through each segment uniformly but does not change the fraction of advective travel at different locations the increase in the mean fractional advective travel time in deep location is mainly due to the decreasing influence from s with depth as it goes deeper the relative importance of s in affecting the advective travel time decreases as a result the advective travel time fraction becomes larger in deeper locations seen in fig 7 b and 7 d fig 8 shows the sensitivity indices and mean advective travel time fractions based on the mean values of ks and s for the stationary ks and s field at a few selected values of correlation range of ln ks and ln s similar to fig 7 the top two figures fig 8 a and 8 b are for the results of sensitivity index and mean advective travel time fraction based on the mean values of ks and s for sand while the bottom two figures fig 8 c and 8 d show the results for silty clay loam the cv for both ks and s is 1 31 since the mean values of ks and s are not related to the correlation range for both sand and silty clay loam the mean advective travel time fraction based on the mean values of ks and s is the same for all correlation range values as discussed earlier the advective travel time fraction in the deeper locations increases overall the correlation range impact on the sensitivity index of advective travel time is smaller compared to the impact of cvs seen from the comparison between figs 7 and 8 4 discussion from fig 3 it can be seen that as the first layer thickness fraction decreases the importance to the overall advective travel time uncertainty cascades downward starting from the second layer in general the sensitivity indices and mean advective travel times in different layers follow the similar pattern the layers in which the mean advective travel times are longer tend to also contribute to the sensitivity indices to a larger extent however in terms of uncertainty contribution longest mean travel time does not correspond to largest uncertainty especially in the top and bottom layers note that when low ks layers are on the top the assumption of saturated sharp wetting front adopted in this study is less accurate that when low ks layers are at the bottom since deep layers with high ks values may become unsaturated cui and zhu 2018 therefore the approach developed in this study will underestimate the total advective travel time in this case however we expect this underestimation will affect the advective travel time sensitivity to a less extent as we can see that the uncertainty distribution is less sensitive than the actual advective travel time fig 4 b and 4 d demonstrate that the mean travel time fraction does not change with the cv of ks this result can be explained by the fact that the advective travel time in each layer is linearly proportional to the value of ks with the increase of cv of ks the mean ks is increased by the same factor of e x p 1 2 σ l n k s 2 therefore the actual advective travel time in each layer is decreased by this same factor which does not change the fractional travel time in each layer however the cv of ks re distributes the sensitivity indices of advective contaminant travel time at different layers the increases in the cv of ks shift the sensitive layers downward to deep region for the layered formation with low ks layers at the bottom this downward shift of travel time sensitivity is more significant seen from comparing fig 4 c to a once again the sensitivity indices and the advective contaminant travel times follow the same pattern with layers with longer travel time being also more sensitive the importance of s to the advective travel time decreases as the advective wetting front is moving downward i e as z in eq 1 increases over time this is reflected by the result that the mean fractional advective travel time in deep layers increases as the increase in the cv of s shown in fig 5 b and 5 d when the cv of s increases deep layers become more important to the uncertainty of advective travel time which is reflected by the increasing sensitivity indices in deep layers with the increase in the cv of s evident from fig 5 a and 5 c while the correlation range affects the sensitivity indices of advective travel time its effect is less significant compared to the cv of ks unlike the impact of the cv of ks the increase of ln ks correlation range slightly decreases the sensitivity of advective travel time in deep layers seen from fig 6 a and 6 c the uncertainty of upper layer hydraulic parameters contributes to the uncertainty of total advective travel time to larger extent as the correlation range of ks becomes larger since the upper layers can better sense the lower layers with a larger correlation range the cv of ks only affects the actual advective travel time but not the fraction of advective travel time in each layer the correlation range does not affect both the actual advective travel time and the mean fraction of advective travel time therefore the mean fraction of advective travel time shown in fig 6 b and 6 d is virtually the same as that in fig 4 b and 4 d additional analysis of the impact of ln s correlation range on the advective travel time fraction and the sensitivity indices of advective travel time has also been conducted overall the cv and correlation range of s plays a less significant role in the uncertainty of advective travel time compared to those of ks since the role of s in affecting the advective travel time diminishes over time as the mean advective travel time fraction becomes larger in the deeper locations the uncertainty of advective travel time is also more dominated by deeper locations evident from the increasingly larger sensitivity index in deeper locations for the case of larger cvs of ks and s however the most significant sensitivity index change occurs near the surface where the sensitivity indices decrease very quickly as the cvs of ks and s increase both the sensitivity index and mean advective travel time fraction are virtually identical for the sand and silty clay loam although their ks values differ significantly which can be seen by comparing fig 7 a and 7 c with fig 7 b and 7 d this is due to the fact that both the sensitivity index and the fraction of advective travel time are not dictated by the absolute values of ks and s but their relative difference at different locations while the results illustrate that the sensitivity index and mean advective travel time fraction for both sand and silty clay loam are virtually identical seen from figs 7 and 8 it should be emphasized that the actual total advective contaminant travel time in silty clay loam is much longer than that in sand for example the total advective travel time is about 2 7 106 s or 31 days in silty clay loam compared to only about 1800 s or 0 02 day in sand for a 1 m soil profile however their sensitivity indices for silty clay loam and sand are virtually identical in other words the relative importance of spatial location to the uncertainty of travel time is independent on the soil texture in the profile although their respective advective travel times through the profile vary significantly with several orders of magnitude the developed approach takes into account the uncertainty and correlation of spatially variable ks and s and is particularly applicable to determine advective contaminant travel time sensitivity to the ks and s in situations where a full contaminant transport model is not available the focus of this study is on the sensitivity analysis of advective contaminant travel time to the uncertainty and correlation of ks and s due to the nature of ga approach focusing only on the advective flow the developed approach has both advantages and disadvantages the major advantage is that the developed sensitivity analysis approach of advective contaminant travel time is analytical and exact and can be used to validate more generic numerical models of sensitivity analysis for the special case of advective contaminant transport in most cases the sensitivity analysis of contaminant transport in natural unsaturated soils using numerical algorithms can be cumbersome with repeated sampling such as monte carlo simulations the analytical approach developed in this study provides a convenient way to validate the advective travel time and its sensitivity to the uncertainty of ks and s on the other hand the approach also carries the major shortcoming of the ga approach with the limitation of neglecting dispersion the approximate nature of the ga approach is also reflected in the developed approach in future studies the sensitivity analysis approach in this study could be incorporated into full contaminant transport models 5 conclusions in this study a new approach is developed to quantify the sensitivity of advective contaminant travel time to the ks and s through a layered heterogeneous unsaturated soil formation the advective contaminant travel time in the layered soil is determined based on the green ampt approximation by assuming that the advective front of contaminant advances is a piston type there is no need to build a full dispersion and advection contaminant transport model the ks and s are treated as stochastic hydraulic parameters with spatial auto correlation the approach can be used in both stationary and non stationary ks and s fields to illustrate the approach these two parameters are assumed to be log normally distributed although any other statistical distributions can also be used major conclusions from this study are summarized as follows 1 the advective contaminant travel time is more sensitive to layers with smaller ks and smaller s values 2 larger uncertainty in the ks and s shift the sensitive layers of advective contaminant travel time to deeper locations for both non stationary layered formation and stationary profile 3 correlation range of both ks and s has less significant impact on the sensitivity of advective contaminant travel time compared to the cvs of ks and s 4 in a stationary ks and s field although the advective contaminant travel time increase significantly for fine textured soil compared to coarse textured soil the fractional contribution of spatial locations to the advective travel time sensitivity is virtually identical for these two types of soil 5 the uncertainty of ks contributes to the uncertainty of advective travel time more significantly than that of s declaration of competing interest the

6283,this study deals with the sensitivity of advective contaminant travel time to soil hydraulic parameters through a heterogeneous soil profile which is often required in many applications such as designing a monitoring network developing a remediation strategy for contaminated sites and determining the associated risks of subsurface contamination the main objective is to determine relative contributions to the output uncertainty of advective travel time from individual input stochastic hydraulic parameters a new approach is developed to examine the sensitivity of advective contaminant travel time to saturated hydraulic conductivity and macroscopic capillary drive as a result of infiltration from a wet and contaminated surface source the approach can be applied to both non stationary layered formation and stationary soil profile the results demonstrate that the advective contaminant travel time is sensitive to the layers with small saturated hydraulic conductivity and small macroscopic capillary drive values larger uncertainty of saturated hydraulic conductivity and macroscopic capillary drive shifts the sensitive layers to the advective travel time to deeper layers correlation range of saturated hydraulic conductivity and macroscopic capillary drive has less significant impact on the sensitivity of advective contaminant travel time than the standard deviation in the stationary saturated hydraulic conductivity and macroscopic capillary drive profile although the advective contaminant travel time increase significantly for fine textured soil compared to coarse textured soil the fractional contribution of spatial locations to the overall uncertainty of total advective travel time is virtually identical for both fine textured and coarse textured soils keywords sensitivity analysis advective contaminant travel time unsaturated heterogeneous soil saturated hydraulic conductivity macroscopic capillary drive 1 introduction sensitivity analysis of flow and contaminant transport in unsaturated zone is important for environmental regulation and remediation design in general the sensitivity analysis quantifies variation of outputs from unsaturated flow and transport models due to changes in model input parameters or other model components such as boundaries and model structures in modeling natural unsaturated zones input parameters are usually treated as uncertain due to heterogeneity and lack of characterizations and knowledge one main objective of sensitivity analysis is to determine relative contributions to the output uncertainties in the quantities of interest from individual input parameters in flow and contaminant transport modeling in this study a new approach is developed to quantify the sensitivity of advective contaminant travel time to soil hydraulic parameters through an unsaturated heterogeneous formation the advective contaminant travel time is determined by wetting front propagation as water infiltrates into soils under wet surface conditions natural soil profiles in the vertical direction are heterogeneous typically in a layered formation with varying hydraulic properties among layers due to natural evolutions assouline 2013 mohammadzadeh habili and heidarpour 2015 the green ampt ga model green and ampt 1911 was one of the earliest infiltration models introduced to describe water infiltration process in unsaturated soil the ga model was developed based on the assumption of rectangular saturated piston wetting front into soil profiles gowdish and muñoz carpena 2009 which means the infiltration is dominantly advective in nature the ga model has been widely used in many numerical hydrological models arnold et al 2012 flanagan et al 2007 rossman 2015 scharffenberg 2015 previous studies have extended the ga model to describe water infiltration process in layered soils chu and mariño 2005 ma et al 2011 in the ga approach the effective hydraulic conductivity ke used in the model is critical and should be carefully determined since the infiltration rate is highly dependent on this parameter in the original ga model green and ampt 1911 treated ke to be the same as the saturated hydraulic conductivity ks several studies suggested however that ke can be taken as smaller than ks due to the air content in soil e g king et al 1999 liu et al 2011 several other studies have shown that ke varies with soil texture air entrapment soil moisture condition and duration of the rainfall lv et al 2015 ma et al 2015 ranging from 0 7ks to ks in the recent study of cui and zhu 2017 the guidelines were established to evaluate ke from comparisons with the numerical solutions of the richards equation performed through hydrus 1d simunek et al 2013 the effective ks was inversely optimized by matching wetting front travel time to saturate the entire soil profile with that from the richard s equation guidelines to select ke were established under 198 scenarios with various soil types overland flow depths and layer formations cui and zhu 2017 depending on the layer configurations and soil textures ke was found to be in the range of 0 6ks to 1 1ks in other words the effective hydraulic conductivity in the ga approach should be in general smaller than ks this study deals with the sensitivity of advective contaminant travel time to soil hydraulic parameters which is often required in many applications such as designing a monitoring network developing a remediation strategy and determining the associated risks of subsurface contamination sensitivity analysis methods can be divided into global sensitivity analysis gsa and local sensitivity analysis lsa gsa methods consider the interaction among different parameters by changing multiple model parameters simultaneously cibin et al 2010 widely used gsa methods include regression analysis morris screening sobol s methods fourier amplitude sensitivity test and regional sensitivity analysis bilotta et al 2012 gamerith et al 2013 mishra et al 2009 morris 1991 norton 2015 olaya abril et al 2017 wang et al 2013 on the other hand lsa methods such as the one variable at a time and the differential analysis method do not take into account the interaction among parameters and therefore are not as efficient as the gsa methods helton 1993 helton and davis 2003 saltelli et al 2000 provided a list of many sensitivity analysis methods regarding sensitivity analysis of advective contaminant travel time several previous studies investigated the advective travel time and its sensitivity to the aquifer parameters such as the hydraulic conductivity for saturated groundwater flows zhu et al 2010 zhu 2012 2018 in this study a new approach is developed to quantify the sensitivity of advective contaminant travel time to soil hydraulic parameters through unsaturated heterogeneous soils in particular both ks and macroscopic capillary drive of unsaturated soil s are treated as uncertain and spatially correlated parameters the basic concept of ga model is used to relate the advective contaminant travel to ks and s as discussed earlier the ga model has been tested extensively and found to be reasonable in determining the advective contaminant travel time into unsaturated soils the developed approach is particularly useful in applications when estimations of contaminant travel times in unsaturated soil are needed but a full advection dispersion contaminant transport models are not available to determine the advective travel time due to infiltration into a heterogeneous unsaturated layered soil the general framework of the ga approach is used by neglecting the dispersion component in adopting the ga approach a relatively high value of effective hydraulic conductivity of ke ks is used as a result the estimated advective travel time is on the conservative side in that using a higher value for the ke will result in a smaller advective travel time i e faster contaminant travel it should be pointed out however that the developed sensitivity analysis approach can be used for any ke values if a smaller ke is used the mean advective travel time through the profile will be longer the conclusions related to the advective travel time sensitivity however should remain the same since the sensitivity is mainly related to the ke uncertainty after the advective travel time through each layer is determined the portion of advective travel time variance i e uncertainty contributed by each layer is quantitatively assessed through the covariance between the total advective travel time through the entire heterogeneous profile and the portion of travel time through that layer the sensitivity of advective travel time to the mean standard deviation and correlation range of the input stochastic hydraulic parameters as well as soil layer arrangement i e how the soil textures in different layers change with depth is then examined and discussed 2 methods 2 1 advective travel time through layered soil in this study the main variable of interest for sensitivity analysis is the advective travel time into a layered and unsaturated soil profile a schematic diagram of infiltration into a heterogeneous layered soil profile is shown in fig 1 in the ga approach it is assumed that the infiltration is advective in nature and the soil profile behind the wetting front is always saturated by using the darcy s law one has 1 df dt k s 1 s z where f is the total infiltration depth t is the time ks is the saturated hydraulic conductivity s is the macroscopic capillary drive morel seytoux and khanji 1974 1975 morel seytoux et al 1996 z is the wetting front depth from the ground surface the total infiltration depth f is related to the wetting front depth by the moisture deficit θs θ0 f z θs θ0 where θs is the saturated water content and θ0 is the initial water content substituting this relationship into eq 1 one has 2 θ s θ 0 dz dt k s z s z eq 2 can be solved under the initial condition z t 0 0 which can be expressed as 3 z s l n z s s k s θ s θ 0 t when the wetting front is at the interface between layer 1 and layer 2 i e z1 l1 eq 3 can be used to determine the time required to travel through layer 1 4 t 1 θ s 1 θ i 1 l 1 s 1 l n l 1 s 1 s 1 k s 1 when the wetting front is in layer i fig 1 the hydraulic head at the interface between layer i 1 and layer i can be determined by the continuity requirement of infiltration rate at the interface the overall hydraulic conductivity for the i 1 saturated layers above layer i is simply the harmonic mean of saturated hydraulic conductivities of all i 1 layers and can be written as 5 k e i 1 k 1 i 1 z k z k 1 k 1 i 1 z k z k 1 k sk z i 1 k 1 i 1 z k z k 1 k sk the continuity equation at the interface can be written

relation to z and dz and then integrate dt from ti 1 to ti and dz from zi 1 to zi to determine the advective travel time from zi 1 to zi which is layer i cui and zhu 2017 13 t i θ si θ 0 i l i k si k

in each layer and the total advective travel time in eqs 13 and 14 the portion of total advective travel time variance i e uncertainty contributed by layer i can be quantitatively assessed through the covariance cov between the total advective travel time through the entire heterogeneous profile and the portion of advective travel time through layer i which is the sensitivity index si of advective travel time to layer i it can be expressed as 15 si i c o v t i t σ t 2 c o v t i j 1 n t j σ t 2 j 1 n c o v t i t j σ t 2 the variance of total advective travel time can be expressed as 16 σ t 2 v a

the sensitivity index of advective travel time using eq 17 one needs to calculate each individual covariance component cov ti tj for all layers in the profile substituting the expression for ti in eq

condition θ0 and layer thickness l i e 5 total stochastic parameters may be all uncertain and stochastic in the following however it is assumed that the initial moisture deficit θs θ0 and layer thickness l are given and deterministic for subsequent analysis and discussion of quantitative results it should be emphasized that the developed approach is applicable to the scenarios where all 5

through a9 in the appendix the formulas expressed in eqs 15 through 19 along with eqs a1 through a9 represent the framework of determining the sensitivity of advective travel time to ks and s due to infiltration from saturated surface source into an initially relatively dry layer soil profile when ks and s are stochastic to proceed further in quantifying and examining the sensitivity of advective travel time to ks and s one needs to prescribe the probability distributions of the uncertain parameters ks and s which will be discussed in the following section 2 3 hydraulic property model and hydraulic parameter probability density distribution the macroscopic capillary drive s is often used in quantifying unsaturated flow from a relatively wet source into a dry soil and can be expressed as follows 20 s 1 k s 0 k ψ d ψ where k is the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity function ψ is the suction head of unsaturated soil while any unsaturated hydraulic conductivity function can be used to calculate s parameter in eq 20 the widely used van genuchten hydraulic conductivity function van genuchten 1980 which was developed by combining the van genuchten soil water retention function with the pore size distribution model of mualem 1976 is adopted to represent the k ψ function 21 k ψ k s 1 α ψ mn 1 α ψ n m 2 1 α ψ n m 2 where α is the pore size distribution parameter n and m are the parameters that determine the shape of the soil water retention curve and can often be related by m 1 1 n using eq 21 s can be approximated as morel seytoux et al 1996 zhu et al 2004 22 s 1 α 0 046 m 2 07 m 2 19 5 m 3 1 4 7 m 16 m 2 from the van genuchten parameters for 12 major soil textural groups according to the study by carsel and parrish 1988 one can calculate s for each soil group fig 2 shows the scatter plot of ln ks and ln s based on these 12 major soil groups from carsel and parrish 1988 it can be seen that lnks and lns are not correlated with the correlation coefficient of only about 0 16 so ln ks and ln s are assumed to be uncorrelated to further simplify the analysis the ks has been reported to follow a lognormal probability distribution nielsen et al 1973 smith and diekkruger 1996 23 f k k s 1 k s σ y 2 π e x p l n k s μ y 2 2 σ y 2 k s 0 where μ y is estimated from the sample mean of lnks ln k s and σ y from the sample standard deviation of lnks slnks for a lognormally distributed ks y lnks is then normally distributed although a commonly used lognormal distribution is used for the hydraulic conductivity to illustrate the method and present some quantitative results to facilitate discussion the developed approach is applicable to any probability distributions of ks and s with known marginal and joint distributions a similar log normal probability density function is also used for the distribution of s 24 f s s 1 s σ z 2 π e x p l n s μ z 2 2 σ z 2 s 0 where μ z is estimated from the sample mean of lns lns and σ z from the sample standard deviation of lns slns similarly z lns is normally distributed although it can be assumed that ks and s are not correlated the ks and s could be auto correlated spatially the bivariate lognormal probability density function pdf of ksi exp yi and ksj exp yj can be obtained as aitchison and brown 1957 yue 2002 25 f 1 k si k sj 1 2 π k si k sj σ y i σ y j 1 ρ 1 2 e x p 1 2 1 ρ 1 2 ln k

ξ d i where ξ is the lag and di is the correlation range of lnks when i 1 or lns when i 2 the developed sensitivity approach can be used in any layer configurations it can be used for either non stationary layered heterogeneous profile where ks and s may have different statistics in different layers it can also be used for stationary profile where ks and s may have the same statistics for the entire profile to account for uncertainties the ks and s in different layers or segments may also be auto correlated in the following section several illustrative cases for both non stationary layered and stationary profile are presented and discussed 2 4 validation of travel time and uncertainty calculations to validate the contaminant travel time and the associated uncertainty formulations the developed analytical approach is compared with numerical solutions for the portion related to contaminant travel time and its uncertainty the hydrus 1d simunek et al 2013 is used in conjunction with the latin hypercube sampling lhs method mckay et al 1979 for contaminant travel time calculation and uncertainty quantification the mean travel time in each layer can be calculated based on the analytical formulation of eq 13 as follows 29 e t i θ si θ 0 i l i e 1 k si k 1 i l k e 1 k sk e l n 1 l i z i 1 s i e 1 k si e z i s i l n 1 l i z i 1 s i the expectation terms e in the above equation can be calculated based on the given probability density functions for ks and s in eqs 23 and 24 the lhs is used to generate 200 random values for the ks and s parameters for each layer in the random sampling based on given probability density functions the lhs ensures that the generated random samples span the full coverage of a random variable even the sample size is relatively small this property of lhs reduces the computational cost of monte carlo simulations based on random sampling for the hydrus 1d simulations the layer profile is discretized into 500 segments and a saturated top boundary condition and a free drainage bottom boundary condition are used for each lhs realization of the ks and s for the uncorrelated ks and s parameters of each layer from the calculated 200 contaminant travel times for each layer the mean contaminant travel times for all the layers can be determined then the comparison can be made between the analytical mean travel times and the numerical ones for all the layers 3 results in the following the effects of the soil layer arrangement coefficient of variation cv and autocorrelation range of both ks and s on the sensitivity of advective contaminant travel time to ks and s are examined using a few selected soil textural groups from carsel and parrish 1988 table 1 lists the van genuchten hydraulic parameters for the selected five soil textural groups in the non stationary layered formation two layer arrangements i e how the soil textures in layers change with depth are examined where the mean ks increases and decrease with depth respectively table 2 shows the comparison results of mean travel times in all layers for the 5 layer profile with increasing ks with depth i e in the flow direction for the case of ks and s being uncorrelated two cases of cv of ks and s of 1 and 4 are used it can be seen that the analytical and numerical results agree very well with largest percent error of 6 5 for comparison the results of travel time based on the simple arithmetic average of ks and s parameters being substituted into eq 13 are also included in table 2 which shows that the errors of using these simplistic average parameters can introduce large errors of under estimation of over 80 in the contaminant travel time therefore the analytical approach of uncertainty quantification in this study is acceptable while using average hydraulic parameters to predict average travel time may produce large errors after validation of the uncertainty analysis portion of the developed approach the main focus of sensitivity analysis results are presented in the following for a few representative cases on the left panel of fig 3 i e fig 3 a and 3 c the sensitivity results of advective contaminant travel time to ks and s are shown for the two different layer arrangements the mean fraction of advective travel time through each corresponding layer based on the mean ks and s is shown on the right panel i e fig 3 b and 3 d for the top two figures fig 3 a and 3 b the 5 layers are arranged with increasing mean ks with depth i e arrangement 1 shown in table 1 while the two bottom figures fig 3 c and 3 d show the results for layer arrangement with decreasing mean ks with depth i e arrangement 2 shown in table 1 for the layer arrangement with low ks layers on top shown in fig 3 a the main controlling layer to the advective contaminant travel time is the top layer as the travel time fraction is larger than the thickness fraction of that layer seen in fig 3 b when the thickness fraction of the first fine soil layer decreases from 0 6 to 0 4 the sensitivity of this layer is virtually unchanged however the second layer becomes more significant to the uncertainty of total advective contaminant travel time with an increased sensitivity index fig 4 shows the sensitivity indices and the mean fractions of advective contaminant travel time based on the mean values of ks and s as functions of cv of ks for two the different layer arrangements in fig 4 and later figures a relatively large range of ks and or s cvs of 1 31 to 7 32 is used to investigate the effects of ks and or s uncertainties fig 4 a and 4 b plot the results for arrangement 1 shown in table 1 while fig 4 c and 4 d plot those for arrangement 2 respectively for a log normally distributed ks and s the mean ks and s increase with the cvs of ks and s while the mean value of ks increases with the cvs of ks the fraction of advective travel time in each layer does not change with the change of the cvs of ks as shown in fig 4 b and fig 4 d however the actual advective travel time decreases with the increase of the cv of ks in each layer to the same extent which results in the same mean fractions of advective travel time in each layer for different cv values of ks fig 5 shows the sensitivity indices and the mean advective contaminant travel time based on the mean values of ks and s as functions of the cv of s for the two different layer arrangements similar to figs 4 5 a and 5 b plot the sensitivity indices and mean advective contaminant travel times for arrangement 1 shown in table 1 while fig 5 c and 5 d plot those results for arrangement 2 the impact of the cv of s on the advective travel time in each layer is different from the cv of ks in this case even though the mean value of s is increased by a same factor for different layers the impact of this factor increase on the actual advective travel time is different at different layers since its impact on the advective travel time is mainly reflected by a secondary non linear ks s term fig 6 shows the sensitivity indices and the mean advective contaminant travel time based on the mean values of ks and s as functions of the correlation range of lnks for two different layer arrangements similar to figs 4 and 5 6 a and 6 b plot the sensitivity indices and mean advective contaminant travel times for arrangement 1 while fig 6 c and 6 d plot those for arrangement 2 obviously the mean values of ks and s are independent of the correlation range of ln ks as a result the correlation range of ln ks does not affect the mean advective travel time fraction in each layer that is only related to the mean ks and s seen in fig 6 b and 6 d fig 7 shows the sensitivity indices and mean advective travel time fractions based on the mean values of ks and s for the stationary ks and s profile at a few selected values of cvs of ks and s fig 7 a and 7 b are respectively for the results of sensitivity index and mean advective travel time fraction based on the mean values of ks and s for sand while fig 7 c and 7 d plot those for silty clay loam the correlation range for both ln ks and ln s is 1 0 with the increase of cvs of ks and s both the mean values of ks and s increase by a factor that is related to the cv values of ks and s the advective travel time is linearly proportional to ks a uniform increase in mean ks decreases the advective travel time through each segment uniformly but does not change the fraction of advective travel at different locations the increase in the mean fractional advective travel time in deep location is mainly due to the decreasing influence from s with depth as it goes deeper the relative importance of s in affecting the advective travel time decreases as a result the advective travel time fraction becomes larger in deeper locations seen in fig 7 b and 7 d fig 8 shows the sensitivity indices and mean advective travel time fractions based on the mean values of ks and s for the stationary ks and s field at a few selected values of correlation range of ln ks and ln s similar to fig 7 the top two figures fig 8 a and 8 b are for the results of sensitivity index and mean advective travel time fraction based on the mean values of ks and s for sand while the bottom two figures fig 8 c and 8 d show the results for silty clay loam the cv for both ks and s is 1 31 since the mean values of ks and s are not related to the correlation range for both sand and silty clay loam the mean advective travel time fraction based on the mean values of ks and s is the same for all correlation range values as discussed earlier the advective travel time fraction in the deeper locations increases overall the correlation range impact on the sensitivity index of advective travel time is smaller compared to the impact of cvs seen from the comparison between figs 7 and 8 4 discussion from fig 3 it can be seen that as the first layer thickness fraction decreases the importance to the overall advective travel time uncertainty cascades downward starting from the second layer in general the sensitivity indices and mean advective travel times in different layers follow the similar pattern the layers in which the mean advective travel times are longer tend to also contribute to the sensitivity indices to a larger extent however in terms of uncertainty contribution longest mean travel time does not correspond to largest uncertainty especially in the top and bottom layers note that when low ks layers are on the top the assumption of saturated sharp wetting front adopted in this study is less accurate that when low ks layers are at the bottom since deep layers with high ks values may become unsaturated cui and zhu 2018 therefore the approach developed in this study will underestimate the total advective travel time in this case however we expect this underestimation will affect the advective travel time sensitivity to a less extent as we can see that the uncertainty distribution is less sensitive than the actual advective travel time fig 4 b and 4 d demonstrate that the mean travel time fraction does not change with the cv of ks this result can be explained by the fact that the advective travel time in each layer is linearly proportional to the value of ks with the increase of cv of ks the mean ks is increased by the same factor of e x p 1 2 σ l n k s 2 therefore the actual advective travel time in each layer is decreased by this same factor which does not change the fractional travel time in each layer however the cv of ks re distributes the sensitivity indices of advective contaminant travel time at different layers the increases in the cv of ks shift the sensitive layers downward to deep region for the layered formation with low ks layers at the bottom this downward shift of travel time sensitivity is more significant seen from comparing fig 4 c to a once again the sensitivity indices and the advective contaminant travel times follow the same pattern with layers with longer travel time being also more sensitive the importance of s to the advective travel time decreases as the advective wetting front is moving downward i e as z in eq 1 increases over time this is reflected by the result that the mean fractional advective travel time in deep layers increases as the increase in the cv of s shown in fig 5 b and 5 d when the cv of s increases deep layers become more important to the uncertainty of advective travel time which is reflected by the increasing sensitivity indices in deep layers with the increase in the cv of s evident from fig 5 a and 5 c while the correlation range affects the sensitivity indices of advective travel time its effect is less significant compared to the cv of ks unlike the impact of the cv of ks the increase of ln ks correlation range slightly decreases the sensitivity of advective travel time in deep layers seen from fig 6 a and 6 c the uncertainty of upper layer hydraulic parameters contributes to the uncertainty of total advective travel time to larger extent as the correlation range of ks becomes larger since the upper layers can better sense the lower layers with a larger correlation range the cv of ks only affects the actual advective travel time but not the fraction of advective travel time in each layer the correlation range does not affect both the actual advective travel time and the mean fraction of advective travel time therefore the mean fraction of advective travel time shown in fig 6 b and 6 d is virtually the same as that in fig 4 b and 4 d additional analysis of the impact of ln s correlation range on the advective travel time fraction and the sensitivity indices of advective travel time has also been conducted overall the cv and correlation range of s plays a less significant role in the uncertainty of advective travel time compared to those of ks since the role of s in affecting the advective travel time diminishes over time as the mean advective travel time fraction becomes larger in the deeper locations the uncertainty of advective travel time is also more dominated by deeper locations evident from the increasingly larger sensitivity index in deeper locations for the case of larger cvs of ks and s however the most significant sensitivity index change occurs near the surface where the sensitivity indices decrease very quickly as the cvs of ks and s increase both the sensitivity index and mean advective travel time fraction are virtually identical for the sand and silty clay loam although their ks values differ significantly which can be seen by comparing fig 7 a and 7 c with fig 7 b and 7 d this is due to the fact that both the sensitivity index and the fraction of advective travel time are not dictated by the absolute values of ks and s but their relative difference at different locations while the results illustrate that the sensitivity index and mean advective travel time fraction for both sand and silty clay loam are virtually identical seen from figs 7 and 8 it should be emphasized that the actual total advective contaminant travel time in silty clay loam is much longer than that in sand for example the total advective travel time is about 2 7 106 s or 31 days in silty clay loam compared to only about 1800 s or 0 02 day in sand for a 1 m soil profile however their sensitivity indices for silty clay loam and sand are virtually identical in other words the relative importance of spatial location to the uncertainty of travel time is independent on the soil texture in the profile although their respective advective travel times through the profile vary significantly with several orders of magnitude the developed approach takes into account the uncertainty and correlation of spatially variable ks and s and is particularly applicable to determine advective contaminant travel time sensitivity to the ks and s in situations where a full contaminant transport model is not available the focus of this study is on the sensitivity analysis of advective contaminant travel time to the uncertainty and correlation of ks and s due to the nature of ga approach focusing only on the advective flow the developed approach has both advantages and disadvantages the major advantage is that the developed sensitivity analysis approach of advective contaminant travel time is analytical and exact and can be used to validate more generic numerical models of sensitivity analysis for the special case of advective contaminant transport in most cases the sensitivity analysis of contaminant transport in natural unsaturated soils using numerical algorithms can be cumbersome with repeated sampling such as monte carlo simulations the analytical approach developed in this study provides a convenient way to validate the advective travel time and its sensitivity to the uncertainty of ks and s on the other hand the approach also carries the major shortcoming of the ga approach with the limitation of neglecting dispersion the approximate nature of the ga approach is also reflected in the developed approach in future studies the sensitivity analysis approach in this study could be incorporated into full contaminant transport models 5 conclusions in this study a new approach is developed to quantify the sensitivity of advective contaminant travel time to the ks and s through a layered heterogeneous unsaturated soil formation the advective contaminant travel time in the layered soil is determined based on the green ampt approximation by assuming that the advective front of contaminant advances is a piston type there is no need to build a full dispersion and advection contaminant transport model the ks and s are treated as stochastic hydraulic parameters with spatial auto correlation the approach can be used in both stationary and non stationary ks and s fields to illustrate the approach these two parameters are assumed to be log normally distributed although any other statistical distributions can also be used major conclusions from this study are summarized as follows 1 the advective contaminant travel time is more sensitive to layers with smaller ks and smaller s values 2 larger uncertainty in the ks and s shift the sensitive layers of advective contaminant travel time to deeper locations for both non stationary layered formation and stationary profile 3 correlation range of both ks and s has less significant impact on the sensitivity of advective contaminant travel time compared to the cvs of ks and s 4 in a stationary ks and s field although the advective contaminant travel time increase significantly for fine textured soil compared to coarse textured soil the fractional contribution of spatial locations to the advective travel time sensitivity is virtually identical for these two types of soil 5 the uncertainty of ks contributes to the uncertainty of advective travel time more significantly than that of s declaration of competing interest the

6284,the september 12 2016 gyeongju earthquakes ml 5 1 of foreshock and ml 5 8 of mainshock had significant effects on groundwater systems along the yangsan fault system composed of nne trending right lateral strike slip faults in korea hydrological changes induced by the earthquakes are important because no surface ruptures have been reported and few earthquakes usually occur in korea the main objective of this research was to propose a conceptual model interpreting the possible mechanisms of groundwater response to the earthquakes based on anomalous hydrogeochemical data including isotope concentrations with lithostratigraphic classification for this annual monitoring data groundwater level temperature and electrical conductivity and collected data hydrochemical parameters radon 222 and strontium isotopes were used groundwater level anomalies could be attributed to the movement of the epicentral strike slip fault radon concentration data showed the potential of groundwater mixing processes strontium anomalies could be related to the lithology and stratigraphy of the bedrock reflecting the effect of water rock interaction using a self organizing map som statistical analysis associations of hydro geochemical characteristics among groundwater wells were interpreted by combining the grouped results of the som with lithostratigraphic unit data 21 groundwater wells were classified into four groups each corresponding to different hydrogeological behaviors a new comprehensive conceptual model was developed to explain possible mechanisms for the hydrological and geochemical responses in each group which have been respectively identified as water rock interaction mixing of shallow and deep aquifers via sea water intrusion bedrock fracture opening related to strike slip fault movement and no response keywords hydrogeological response earthquake radon strontium isotopes self organizing map conceptual model 1 introduction earthquakes have a great influence on groundwater hydrology such as water table changes and hydrochemical anomalies typically most studies have focused on earthquake forecasting i e changes prior to earthquakes or co seismic behavior there have been a limited number of studies that discuss the responses of groundwater systems especially focused on the hydrogeologic changes after earthquakes adinolfi falcone et al 2012 amoruso et al 2011 barberio et al 2017 claesson et al 2007 ekemen keskin 2010 galassi et al 2014 lee et al 2013 matsumoto et al 2003 petitta et al 2018 wang and manga 2010 wang et al 2012 yechieli and bein 2002 seismic waves for example are known to cause changes in water level temperature and geochemistry adinolfi falcone et al 2012 matsumoto et al 2003 roeloffs et al 2003 roeloffs 1998 shi et al 2015 wang et al 2012 seismicity can also cause abrupt changes or have long term effects on the environment particularly groundwater systems hydrological responses to seismicity depend on several factors such as the earthquake magnitude distance from the epicenter the chemical and physical properties of the water geological structures permeability and the pore pressure of rocks ekemen keskin 2010 hartmann and levy 2005 petitta et al 2018 for example ekemen keskin 2010 stated that the observed changes in aquifers could be explained using a dilatancy fluid model the response to earthquakes could be attributed to the changes in the water mixing ratio because of aquifer permeability pore pressure and flow path in addition the physical influencing factors can affect the groundwater system ataie ashtiani et al 2001 bodvarsson 1970 bredehoeft 1967 kümpel 1991 kümpel 1992 maréchal et al 2002 shih 2018 wu and zhuang 2010 yan et al 2014 yi et al 2012 locally heterogeneous responses of groundwater have been also observed and associated with the dominant lithology and mineralogy of bedrocks frape et al 1984 kim et al 1996 shand et al 2009 local degree of deformation fitz diaz et al 2011 or fracture networks allowing groundwater flow gray et al 1991 considering these hydraulic properties some previous studies have proposed the conceptual models for describing the aquifer responses to earthquakes adinolfi falcone et al 2012 amoruso and crescentini 2010 amoruso et al 2011 barberio et al 2017 manga 2001 roeloffs 1998 tokunaga 1999 on september 12 2016 two earthquakes ml 5 1 and ml 5 8 respectively occurred in gyeongju in the southeastern part of the korean peninsula korea meteorological administration the mainshock of the gyeongju events was recorded as the largest earthquake in korea since instrumental seismic monitoring started in korea in 1978 the source mechanism of the gyeongju earthquakes displayed strike slip movement of a branch of the yangsan fault ysf passing through the gyeongju area kim et al 2017b kim et al 2016 slip analysis and earthquake focal mechanism solutions have shown that the ysf is under a regional compressional stress field which might be a result of the continental collision of the pacific eurasian and indian plates jiang et al 2016 park et al 2007 park et al 2006 zoback 1992 gyeongju area is spatially close to the ysf thus the gyeongju events might allow more detailed studies about characteristics of the ysf and its branch faults including groundwater responses after earthquakes the earthquake related indicators in hydrogeology generally include i groundwater level ii temperature iii hydrochemistry and iv isotope concentrations groundwater level monitoring has been broadly used to identify pre co and post earthquake changes brodsky 2003 manga et al 2012 roeloffs 1998 shi et al 2015 wang and manga 2010 seismic waves have been known to affect the groundwater level via oscillations and permanent offsets temperature changes are commonly analyzed using heat transport modeling ekemen keskin 2010 wang et al 2012 earthquake induced changes in groundwater level of the wells would be affected by one of the following phenomena i pore water pressure increase related to compression of alluvial sediments roeloffs 1998 ii pore water pressure decrease in response to the emanation of subsoil gas barberio et al 2017 matsumoto et al 2003 iii a fracture cleaning by pore pressure propagation enhancing the hydraulic conductivity in the aquifer adinolfi falcone et al 2012 iv soil liquefaction of upper crust sediments in response to an applied stress of the event wang and manga 2010 and v the strain sensitivity of a possible weak zone which has low stiffness moduli shear modulus skempton ratio and poisson ratio of the soil or rock medium kümpel 1991 kümpel 1992 in this study groundwater chemistry major elements and some physical chemical parameters ph ec and temperature were monitored among the isotopes oxygen hydrogen and radon 222 were analyzed to determine the effects of the earthquake on groundwater radon 222 particularly has been generally monitored as an earthquake precursor sampled in water or air igarashi et al 1995 king 1978 liu et al 1984 noguchi and wakita 1977 roeloffs 1999 teng 1980 wakita et al 1980 radon 222 is a radioactive nuclide with a half life of approximately 3 8 days it is produced from radium 226 in the natural radioactive decay chain of uranium 228 thus its concentration is proportional to the uranium concentration in adjacent rocks the transport of radon is influenced by fluid advection diffusion partition between the liquid and gas phases and radioactive decay the radon concentration in groundwater is dependent on the specific surface of the rocks hoehn and von gunten 1989 torgersen et al 1990 because the specific surface can be affected by earthquakes the radon concentration can increase or decrease radon 222 also shows significant anomalies at fault zones prior to earthquakes ghosh et al 2009 walia et al 2009 wang and fialko 2015 however a few studies have delineated the response of radon concentration to earthquakes adinolfi falcone et al 2012 igarashi et al 1993 igarashi and wakita 1990 strontium isotopes have been used in only a few earthquake related papers strontium isotopes are useful tracers for groundwater origin and water rock mixing processes because 87sr is the daughter product of the natural decay of radioactive 87rb half life 48 9 ga the 87sr 86sr ratios of the bedrock aquifers were different according to rock types of bedrock frape et al 1984 frost and toner 2004 négrel et al 2004 shand et al 2009 thus strontium isotopes in groundwater can also reveal significant post earthquake anomalies at fault zones according to bedrock type the main objective of this study was to identify hydrogeochemical changes related to the gyeongju earthquake and then suggest a conceptual model of the response of the groundwater systems to the earthquake using the grouping results in accordance with this objective major research results were achieved via i performing a correlation and cluster analysis of hydrochemical parameters with geological characteristics using the som approach ii analyzing pre co and post seismic changes in groundwater level temperature and ec and iii interpreting the results of isotopes radon and strontium sampled following the earthquake based on the grouping these results could help to provide the possible mechanisms of groundwater changes induced by the earthquake the overview of this research is shown in fig 1 2 study area the gyeongju earthquake sequence started with a foreshock ml 5 1 at 10 44 32 utc on september 12 2016 and the mainshock ml 5 8 occurred at 11 32 55 utc korea meteorological administration during the first 10 days following the mainshock more than 120 earthquakes of ml 2 0 were recorded in the epicentral region the earthquakes including the mainshock and strong aftershocks ml 3 5 are listed in table 1 the korean peninsula is composed of three major precambrian massifs the nangrim gyeonggi and youngnam from north to the south the gyeongsang basin is the northern part of the youngnam massif and the yangsan fault system has developed in the eastern part of the gyeongsang basin the yangsan fault system is a group of nne trending major strike slip faults the gyeongju earthquake and its abundant aftershocks occurred near the ysf fig 2 a which has a linear expression for approximately 200 km and is the longest major fault of the yangsan fault system kyung and lee 2006 the displacement of the fault varies between 21 km and 35 km depending on the location and the arrangement of the granitic rocks in this area indicates cenozoic dextral strike slip of 21 3 km in the n 20 e direction along the ysf line hwang et al 2007 hwang et al 2004 since lee and na 1983 first suggested that a quaternary reactivation of the yangsan fault system could be possible a number of seismic geological and geophysical studies have proved its seismic activation kyung and lee 1999 kyung and lee 2006 lee and jin 1991 the gyeongju area has been subject to most of the large historical earthquakes that have occurred in korea initial movement on the ysf was recorded to have occurred before 45 ma based on radiometric dating of volcanic rocks chang et al 1990 age dating using the accelerator mass spectrometry ams method indicates late quaternary movement of the ysf between 2400 and 2000 yrs bp and an average vertical slip rate of approximately 0 04 0 05 mm yr kyung and chang 2001 recent measurement of the vertical slip rate of ysf reported less than 0 1 mm yr on average 0 02 0 07 mm yr in the southern part and 0 03 0 05 mm yr in the northern part kyung 2003 kyung and lee 2006 indicating that the ysf has been seismically active paleo stress analyses have noted that the stress regime of the ysf has changed more than three times kang and ryoo 2009 kim et al 1996 and during the quaternary the ene wsw maximum compression is in agreement with the first order stress field in east asia chang et al 2010 heidbach et al 2010 zoback 1992 trench analysis of the yugye fault the youngest quaternary fault in the northern part of the ysf also yielded a nw se or wnw ene compressional local maximum principal stress kim and jin 2006 for the gyeongju event also under this ene wnw compression geophysical studies of the aftershocks recognized the subsurface fault plane has a strike of nne 25 30 and a dip of 65 74 with a depth ranging from 11 km to 16 km the width of the distribution of event locations is approximately 5 km in length and was determined to be a branch of the ysf hong et al 2017 kim et al 2017a lee et al 2018 son et al 2017 twelve wells are located near the ysf and the surrounding area within the gyeongsang basin fig 2b the information for each well is shown in table 2 the wells generally were installed by two types at each point the one

by different boreholes thus we can assume that groundwater mixing between two aquifer systems did not happen during purging out or sampling the groundwater the sampled water was analyzed for hydrochemical parameters major ions radon concentration and strontium isotopes the hydrogeochemical parameters such as temperature ec dissolved oxygen do total dissolved solids tds ph and salinity were measured in the field using an ysi prodss digital sampling system xylem usa when the real time measured values of those parameters were constant the groundwater was sampled for 22 wells the analysis of cations and anions na k ca mg cl no3 so4 and hco3 including strontium isotopes was completed using filtered water samples at the korea basic science institute kbsi 87sr 86sr ratios were obtained using a neptune multicollector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer mc icp ms thermo finnigan germany upgraded with a large dry interface pump yields were approximately 100 and the matrix concentration did not exceed 1 of the strontium concentrations the total procedural blanks were negligible with less than 1 ng of sr the 87sr 86sr ratios were normalized to 86sr 88sr 0 1194 faure 1986 and the mean 87sr 86sr ratio of nbs987 u s national bureau of standards was 0 710247 0 000017 2σ n 18 the radon concentrations in the groundwater samples were measured using rtm1688 2 of sarad an air bubbling 500 ml flask was filled with sampled water and connected to the monitor for a closed air loop the measurement was conducted at 15 min intervals the attained values were calibrated adjusting for the short half life of radon the unit offers a high sensitivity of better than 3 cpm kbq m3 obtained from a very small internal volume of only 130 ml 3 2 self organizing map som self organizing map som analysis is a neural network organized on a low dimensional array of processing units kohonen 1982 the som consists of two layers the input layer and the output layer neurons layer these two layers are interconnected via a weight vector the neurons in the output layer are connected to adjacent neurons by a neighborhood relation dictating the structure of the topographic map in this study the layer of neurons was arranged onto a two dimensional grid the som is an unsupervised learning algorithm without prior information of classification the learning algorithm procedure can be described as follows i determine the number of neurons ii initialize the weight vectors with small random values iii choose the best matching neurons or the best matching unit bmu that is the closest to the input vector and iv update the best matching neurons and neighboring neurons the results can be visualized using two different types of map the component planes and the u matrix vesanto 1999 the component plane representation visualizes relative component values of the weight vectors providing correlations between components the u matrix i e the unified distance matrix enables clustering analysis using the distance between the weight vectors and their neighborhood the simulation was completed using the som toolbox 2 0 for matlab 5 vesanto and alhoniemi 2000 4 results 4 1 groundwater level temperature and ec changes groundwater level changes in seven monitoring wells can be classified into three types i no change related to the earthquake kw 5 1 and kw 5 2 ii maintenance after an instantaneous increase or decrease kw 8 1 kw 8 2 and kw 11 2 and iii recovery to original values after a sudden change kw 11 1 fig 3 the two sigma thresholds were marked as lines the other groundwater level variations were shown in supplementary fig s1 the groundwater level of the kw 5 wells did not change regardless of earthquake showing the data was included in the range between 2σ and 2σ fig 3a at the kw 8 wells there was an abrupt increase during the earthquake and maintenance after the earthquake particularly in the bedrock aquifer well which is out of the range between 2σ and 2σ kw 8 2 fig 3b the groundwater level response to the earthquake in the alluvial aquifer well was in contrast to that in the bedrock aquifer well at the kw 11 wells fig 3c the groundwater level of kw 11 1 slightly increased before the earthquake and then decreased however the groundwater level of kw 11 2 drastically decreased and then gradually recovered and it remained at higher values compared to the original values kw 11 2 also showed the water level variations which are out of the range between 2σ and 2σ indicating that the anomalies related to the earthquakes followed the two sigma rule groundwater temperature changes only occurred at the kw 11 wells fig 4 a these also showed an opposite change pattern in which the groundwater temperature of kw 11 1 recovered to the original value after an instantaneous increase whereas that of kw 11 2 recovered after a slight decrease this anomaly was apparent in the alluvial aquifer well kw 11 1 unlike the groundwater level anomaly a change in groundwater ecs was observed at eight monitoring wells before during or after the earthquake kw 1 responded to the earthquake in a peak form and gradually recovered kw 2 showed an increase prior to the earthquake and recovered to original values the groundwater ec consistently decreased and then remained at lower values at kw 6 1 kw 6 2 and kw 10 2 the peak form of the kw 11 wells also indicated an opposite direction fig 4b kw 11 1 peaked at a higher level several times prior to the earthquake while kw 11 2 peaked at a lower level before the earthquake and then recovered compared to the water level data however it was difficult to interpret that the changes in ec could be attributed to the earthquake 4 2 hydrogeochemical characteristics including isotopes radon and strontium the hydrogeochemical data of 17 parameters na k ca mg cl no3 so4 hco3 temperature ph do ec tds salinity sr 87sr 86sr and radon were collected from 21 groundwater samples and one surface water sample kw 11 3 in january 2017 the analytical results of the water samples are summarized in table 3 the na values were high in kw 4 1 kw 4 2 and kw 6 2 100 mg l and the cl values were high in kw 4 1 and kw 4 2 100 mg l the kw 4 1 and kw 4 2 had especially high ec and salinity values the so4 values were high in kw 1 and kw 10 2 200 mg l the distribution of radon concentration in the 21 groundwater samples is shown in fig 5 the radon concentration ranged from 225 bq m3 to 23 060 bq m3 in the gyeongju area see table 3 the kw 5 1 kw 5 2 and kw 8 2 values were 15849 17575 and 23 060 bq m3 respectively which were higher values than those of the other groundwater wells these wells are near the epicenter lower values 1000 bq m3 were found in kw6 1 kw 6 2 kw 7 1 kw 9 1 kw 9 2 kw 10 1 kw 10 2 and kw 11 1 the values between the alluvial and bedrock aquifer wells were similar in kw 4 kw 5 kw 6 and kw 7 the value difference between two formation wells was high in kw 8 kw 10 and kw 11 kw 7 kw 9 and kw 11 showed an anomaly in which the alluvial aquifer well had a higher radon concentration than the bedrock aquifer well the strontium isotopic compositions of groundwater samples in the gyeongju area are shown in fig 6 strontium concentrations ranged from 18 1 ppb to 4052 ppb the 87sr 86sr values ranged from 0 705688 to 0 712368 see table 3 in the alluvial aquifer wells the 87sr 86sr values ranged from 0 706191 to 0 708353 and these values were from 0 705688 to 0 712368 in the bedrock aquifer wells the strontium isotopic compositions of the groundwater samples also reflected distinct ratios based on their lithology and stratigraphy the hayang group kw 1 kw 2 kw 9 2 and kw 10 2 had high strontium concentrations the 87sr 86sr values of the bulguksa group kw 3 kw 5 2 and kw 12 2 ranged from 0 706575 to 0 708022 cretaceous volcanic rocks kw 8 2 and kw 11 2 are below the bulguksa group the kw 6 wells had distinct characteristics in which kw 6 1 was far from kw 6 2 the spatial distributions of strontium concentrations and 87sr 86sr are shown in fig 7 exceptionally high strontium concentrations were observed in kw 1 kw 2 and kw 10 2 3000 ppb whereas kw 3 kw 4 1 kw 6 1 kw 6 2 kw 7 2 kw 8 2 kw 10 3 kw 11 1 had significantly low values 100 ppb the wells that had high strontium concentrations were in the hayang group for the 87sr 86sr results kw 1 kw 2 kw 6 2 kw 10 2 and kw 11 2 had high ratio values while kw 3 kw 6 1 kw 7 1 kw 8 2 and kw 11 1 had low ratio values the values between the alluvial and bedrock aquifer wells were quite different in kw 6 kw 8 kw 10 and kw 11 calcium and strontium cation contents of the groundwater samples showed various distributions ranging from 1 59 mg l to 94 89 mg l for calcium and from 18 1 ppb to 4052 ppb for strontium concentration fig 8 the sr2 cation contents of the hayang group ranged from 18 1 ppb to 4052 ppb which was much higher than the values generally measured in groundwater as hundreds of ppb frost and toner 2004 santoni et al 2016 most groundwater wells located along the linear path except kw 2 kw 4 2 and kw 11 2 kw 9 1 and kw 10 1 had high values among alluvial aquifer wells 4 3 self organizing map som there are few studies using som for groundwater quality data interpretation choi et al 2014 hong and rosen 2001 lischeid 2008 however we used the som analysis for statistical analysis in the gyeongju area because it can solve linear dimensionality reduction problems without biases this method also provides the detailed local relationship between the variables by the component planes which is helpful to understand groundwater systems visually in the study this statistical analysis was conducted using hydrochemical parameters of each well at different locations for spatial interpretation not time series data at one well the contribution map of the variables is shown in the component map fig 9 each component plane represents the average component value at each node in a certain color the white indicates the high values and the deep brown indicates the low values the dataset contained data regarding 16 variables na k ca mg cl no3 so4 hco3 sr 87sr 86sr temperature ph do ec tds and salinity see table 3 the raw data were normalized in order to work with transformed quantities with zero mean and unit standard deviation by comparing component planes the planes of ca so4 sr and 87sr 86sr show similar distributions indicating a strong correlation between these variables the na cl hco3 ec tds and salinity values also had similar patterns to each other these variables show vertical symmetry with the planes of ca so4 sr and 87sr 86sr the components of temperature ph do k and no3 are distinct from each other showing no relationship with the other variables the clustering could be investigated with the visual inspection of the u matrix result fig 10 deep brown shades on the u matrix indicate a large distance between neighborhood nodes whereas white shades correspond to a short distance between nodes based on the distances the distribution of water samples could be classified into four groups group 1 kw 1 kw 2 kw 9 1 and kw 10 1 group 2 kw 3 kw 5 1 kw 5 2 kw 6 2 kw 11 3 and kw 12 1 group 3 kw 4 1 and kw 4 2 and group 4 kw 8 1 kw 11 1 and kw 11 2 the classification has similar results with the classification based on lithostratigraphic unit data although the results did not include all water samples group 1 has relatively high values of ca mg so4 no3 sr and 87sr 86sr group 2 falls between group 3 and group 4 group 3 is characterized by distinctly high values in k na cl hco3 ec tds and salinity group 4 has high do values and a distinct low temperature and 87sr 86sr with relatively low values of ec tds salinity and sr 5 discussion 5 1 groundwater level temperature and ec changes the gyeongju earthquake on september 12 2016 remarkably affected the groundwater systems the total data showing anomalies are shown in table 4 the groundwater level temperature and ec data were analyzed considering pre co and post seismic changes three anomaly types were observed in the groundwater level data see fig 3 the maintenance of a groundwater level increase could be attributed to aquifer compaction as observed in kw 8 1 and kw 8 2 lee et al 2002 there is a possibility that the aquifers underwent non recoverable deformation the persistent groundwater level changes also have been influenced by volumetric strain changes matsumoto et al 2003 roeloffs et al 2003 wang et al 2007 in contrast a greater decrease in groundwater level prior to the earthquake could be attributed to the opening of bedrock fractures as observed in kw 11 1 fleeger et al 1999 kitagawa et al 2006 rojstaczer and wolf 1992 rojstaczer et al 1995 wang et al 2004 a decrease could also possibly be related to a change in permeability brodsky 2003 manga and wang 2007 there is another anomaly an opposite change pattern between the alluvial and bedrock aquifer wells as observed in all datasets of groundwater level temperature and ec data for kw 11 see figs 3 and 4 this means that the two wells had weak interactions with each other groundwater level oscillation also depends on the interactions between inflow outflow of the well and of the aquifer cooper et al 1965 however it was difficult to be revealed in our data because our time resolution of groundwater level data is relatively long 1 h in addition one important physical influencing factor the earth tide is negligible or not influencial because earth tide can cause relatively small fluctuations from a few centimeters to tens of centimeters compared to the observed anomaly caused by the earthquakes in this study from a few meters to tens of meters shi et al 2015 moreover the rock type hosting kw8 and kw 11 wells is felsic volcanic rocks which tend to have the higher range of elastic stiffness moduli compared to that of sedimentary rocks or unconsolidated sediments kümpel 1992 therefore the groundwater level change of both wells would not be related to their whole rock rigid lithology high stiffness moduli but probably with the distribution of a weak zone in their aquifer in other words the groundwater level changes in the igneous rock aquifers would imply the location of the bottom end of the wells in contact with a massive hydraulic fracture zone in the rocks kind of an artificial weak zone kümpel 1992 5 2 isotopic data radon and strontium the hydrogeochemical data of 17 parameters na k ca mg cl no3 so4 hco3 temperature ph do ec tds salinity sr 87sr 86sr and radon were collected only after earthquake jan 2017 a difference in radon concentration between the alluvial and bedrock aquifer wells could be considered more significant because of the mixing effect as observed in kw 8 and kw 11 see fig 5 seismotectonic activity may often change the mixing ratio of groundwater in a well claesson et al 2007 hartmann and levy 2005 the anomaly in which the alluvial aquifer well had a higher radon concentration than that of the bedrock aquifer could be attributed to rainfall however in this area rainfall did not occur during the sampling period as observed in kw 7 kw 9 and kw 11 the large variation in the 87sr 86sr ratios in the groundwater can consequently largely be explained by the nature of the aquifer lithology see figs 6 and 7 for example the high rb sr ratio of composite silicate minerals such as feldspar and biotite can cause granitic bedrock to be highly radiogenic frost and toner 2004 santoni et al 2016 generally cretaceous granites comprising the gyeongsang basin had a strontium concentration from 62 ppm to 428 ppm and an 87sr 86sr ratio from 0 704610 to 0 711400 cheong and jo 2017 basaltic rocks near the yeonil group and janggi group had strontium concentration from 439 ppm to 518 ppm and the 87sr 86sr ratio from 0 703850 to 0 704630 shimazu et al 1990 in the chaeyaksan basaltic volcanics of the yucheon group strontium concentration ranged from 731 ppm to 1667 ppm and the 87sr 86sr ratio from 0 705870 to 0 706440 yun 1998 thus samples of the bulguksa granite would be more radiogenic than those of the yucheon group rocks because of the composite minerals of the bulguksa granite plagioclase feldspar and biotite which have high 87sr 86sr ratios the strong correlation between strontium and calcium could indicate the chemical signature such as water rock interactions see fig 8 the outlier kw 2 kw 4 2 and kw 11 2 can indicate another chemical mechanism such as other water source the high values of kw 9 1 and kw 10 1 can suggest the influence from the kw 9 2 and kw 10 2 5 3 the conceptual model with the grouping results this paper is to combine the hydrologic hydrogeochemical and lithostratigraphic characteristics by applying the neural network method som the som results using the hydrogeochemical data showed the 4 groups however these did not include kw 6 1 kw 7 1 kw 7 2 kw 8 2 kw 9 2 kw 10 2 and kw 12 2 in the u matrix for including all groundwater samples the new grouping was conducted to reflect the two grouping results lithostratigraphic unit and the som the som results were also in agreement with the lithostratigraphic unit data which was used usefully in arranging the bedrock aquifer wells based on bedrock characteristics especially this statistical method could consider the factor of external effects e g earthquakes as well as the major ions it is useful because the public activity generally has existed around the groundwater wells among other methods in general piper diagram provides relative proportions of water rock interactions which is difficult to indicate directly the external effects other than geologic characteristics thus by using the two results the final grouping yielded four classes of wells group a kw 1 kw 2 kw 9 and kw 10 group b kw 3 kw 5 and kw 12 group c kw 4 kw 6 and kw 7 and group d kw 8 and kw 11 this is conducted by binding the alluvial and bedrock aquifer wells the dependencies between the variables hydrochemical parameters including strontium isotopes could be interpreted with the component plane results from the som see fig 9 these correlations were also used for analyzing the possible mechanisms at each group the lithology and stratigraphy of group a are classified as hayang group shale and sandstone of low porosity and high strontium concentrations particularly the kw 9 and the kw 10 wells had a low radon concentration 1000 bq m3 high strontium concentration high ca value low 87sr 86sr ratio and low ph see figs 8 and 9 there might be some possible mechanisms for the exceptionally strong chemical signatures regarding earthquakes first the fine grained bedrock of group a has a large reactive surface area that can effectively activate water rock interaction and largely vary the groundwater chemistry via ion exchange pennisi et al 2006 second particularly for kw 10 2 in group a the exceptionally high sr samples appear to be an effect of cation exchange between the soil and surrounding water the capacity of the cation bearing soil cation exchange capacity cec depends on the ph of the surrounding water and the cec of a soil generally show decreases with ph decreases sparks 2003 the acidic water of kw10 2 ph 2 27 would lead to lower cec and lead to leaching of ca2 and sr2 from the soil to surrounding groundwater the flow into the groundwater in the hayang group rocks could increase the chemical concentration of group a third the results could be attributed to geological characteristics not related to the earthquake as the intrinsic chemistry of the hayang group shale and sandstone might affect the strontium concentrations such dramatically high values of sr were previously observed in the redbeds aquifer from 885 ppb to 7851 ppb where the lithology of the bedrock is composed of shale and sandstone with high rb sr ratios santoni et al 2016 moreover by the som results kw 1 kw 2 kw 9 1 and kw 10 1 were clustered as one group see fig 10 also suggesting the strong influence from bedrock to shallow aquifer group b wells are located in biotite granitic region of the bulguksa group which has a typical high radon concentration the radon concentration is greatly influenced by uranium content thus its concentration is generally high in granite compared to that of sedimentary rocks typically uranium concentration is high in granites whereas it is low in sedimentary rocks however only the kw 5 wells had a high radon concentration in particular kw 5 1 had high values similar to those of kw 5 2 this could be attributed to deep fluid upwelling from the bedrock in the kw 5 wells chiodini et al 2000 minissale 2004 savoy et al 2011 group c is composed of tuff and tuffaceous sedimentary rocks of the yeonil and janggi groups this group had a low radon concentration and a small difference in radon concentration between the alluvial and the bedrock aquifer wells see fig 5 suggesting active water mixing between the two aquifers in addition the bedrock of this area contains conglomerates which generally have high pore density leading to active mixing with water compared to the shale dominant lithology this hypothesis seems to be consistent with the weak chemical signature of group a kw 4 1 kw 4 2 and kw 6 2 had high values of ec cl tds and salinity values see table 3 and fig 9 suggesting the possibility of sea water intrusion by the effects of the earthquakes in group d the radon concentration was quite different between the two wells and the groundwater level anomaly occurred see figs 3 and 5 the wells of this group are in cretaceous mainly andesitic volcanic rocks this group showed obvious anomaly caused by the earthquakes with the annual data the maintenance of a groundwater level increase was observed in kw 8 wells kw 11 wells in particular showed many factors including groundwater level temperature and ec responded to the earthquake in an opposite manner see figs 3 and 4 the wells of kw8 and kw11 are located in the trigger zone compressional region in the coulomb stress field of the gyeongju events hong et al 2017 the compressional stress in the trigger zone would induce a decrease of hydraulic diffusion and a change of pore pressure which may result in maintenance of water level wang et al 2004 kw 11 2 which showed the greater decrease of groundwater level prior to the earthquake suggested the possibility of the opening of bedrock fractures or liquefaction roeloffs 1998 moreover in a fractal analysis conducted near the wells of kw8 and kw11 many examples of the fracture network which have developed since early tertiary are investigated to have a correlation with recent evolution of the yangsan fault park et al 2010 in addition the sr contents of group b and group d showed a wide range of concentrations observed in other studies of groundwater in the granitic bedrock aquifers e g an sr2 from 67 to 169 ppb frost and toner 2004 and from 103 to 553 ppb santoni et al 2016 this wide range might be associated with the different amount of plagioclase in each matrix rock of the groundwater water flow via granite can be controlled by the dissolution of anorthite and alkali feldspar the former occurs more rapidly providing ca2 and sr2 with a low 87sr 86sr ratio see figs 8 and 9 bullen et al 1997 franklyn et al 1991 négrel 2006 in contrast one groundwater chemistry study in canada showed that dissolution of alkali feldspar can increase the 87sr 86sr ratio providing sodium and potassium bullen et al 1996 therefore the various compositions of the granite and the fluid mobility would be determinative in the 87sr 86sr ratio in accordance with this analysis conceptual models of groundwater changes induced by the earthquakes can be suggested fig 11 four different models were inferred by data analysis and the grouping result using the som approach first a response highlighting the mixing with deep groundwater or bedrock can be attributed to a deep fluid rise which resulted in high strontium concentrations as observed in the wells of group a kw 1 and kw 2 in addition low radon values and high 87sr 86sr ratios were observed in the wells of the alluvial aquifer kw 9 1 and kw 10 1 second the possibility of non recoverable deformation after deep fluid upwelling can be suggested as there was no change in water level and there were high radon concentrations in both wells of the alluvial and bedrock aquifers kw 5 1 and kw 5 2 in group b this hypothesis can be supported by studies showing that the stress reduction after an earthquake causes closure of cracks king and cocco 2001 nur and booker 1972 peng and zhao 2009 scholz 2002 scholz et al 1973 the other wells of group b could be classified as an uninfluenced by the earthquakes third another mechanism the strong interaction between shallow and deep aquifers can be attributed to sea water intrusion by the data showing a small difference in radon concentration between the alluvial and the bedrock aquifer wells as observed in group c finally the response to the movement of the strike slip fault can be explained considering the location of group d which is near the ysf the water level anomaly suggests the potential that the source of the alluvial aquifer well changed a different source compared to that of bedrock aquifer well after the earthquakes see fig 3 bedrock fracture opening could cause a decrease in water level suggesting that surrounding aquifer affected the alluvial aquifer of these wells because of the difference in water level as observed in kw 11 2 in contrast the groundwater level appeared to remain constant at a higher value than the pre earthquake value via aquifer compaction because of the movement of the strike slip fault at the kw 8 wells 6 conclusion the 2016 gyeongju earthquakes affected the pre co and post earthquake groundwater systems changes were observed in groundwater level temperature ec hydrochemistry radon 222 and strontium isotopic data the main findings obtained via data analysis from 21 monitoring wells are as follows 1 the observed groundwater level anomaly could be attributed to pre earthquakes effect not a seasonal effect maintenance persistent or abrupt changes and oscillation of water levels were observed in some wells 2 the radon concentration could be interpreted as the difference between alluvial and bedrock aquifer wells a relatively small difference between two radon values implies active mixing processes between the shallow and deep aquifers 3 strontium isotopes were interpreted with the lithology and stratigraphy of bedrock indicating the potential of water rock interactions these isotopes sr2 concentrations and 87sr 86sr ratio also could suggest both geologically independent causes and dependent causes with respect to the earthquakes 4 the som statistic tool was found to be useful for identifying each group having common characteristics and the influence of the earthquakes on hydrogeochemical parameters the final grouping can explain the possible mechanisms via different hydrogeochemical processes i water rock interactions because of deep fluid rising ii no response to the earthquakes or non recoverable deformation after the earthquakes iii aquifer mixing vertically due to sea water intrusion and iv the effect of the movement of the strike slip fault these results can have significant impact on regional and national authorities because seismicity has increased in the area near gyeongju since 2016 it may be more helpful in efficiently managing groundwater systems to analyze the combined hydrogeochemical and lithostratigraphic characteristics of the area in addition the studied parameters and the adopted methods would be positively applied for other earthquake zones particularly for grouping interpretation of responses of monitoring wells acknowledgments this work was supported by the

6284,the september 12 2016 gyeongju earthquakes ml 5 1 of foreshock and ml 5 8 of mainshock had significant effects on groundwater systems along the yangsan fault system composed of nne trending right lateral strike slip faults in korea hydrological changes induced by the earthquakes are important because no surface ruptures have been reported and few earthquakes usually occur in korea the main objective of this research was to propose a conceptual model interpreting the possible mechanisms of groundwater response to the earthquakes based on anomalous hydrogeochemical data including isotope concentrations with lithostratigraphic classification for this annual monitoring data groundwater level temperature and electrical conductivity and collected data hydrochemical parameters radon 222 and strontium isotopes were used groundwater level anomalies could be attributed to the movement of the epicentral strike slip fault radon concentration data showed the potential of groundwater mixing processes strontium anomalies could be related to the lithology and stratigraphy of the bedrock reflecting the effect of water rock interaction using a self organizing map som statistical analysis associations of hydro geochemical characteristics among groundwater wells were interpreted by combining the grouped results of the som with lithostratigraphic unit data 21 groundwater wells were classified into four groups each corresponding to different hydrogeological behaviors a new comprehensive conceptual model was developed to explain possible mechanisms for the hydrological and geochemical responses in each group which have been respectively identified as water rock interaction mixing of shallow and deep aquifers via sea water intrusion bedrock fracture opening related to strike slip fault movement and no response keywords hydrogeological response earthquake radon strontium isotopes self organizing map conceptual model 1 introduction earthquakes have a great influence on groundwater hydrology such as water table changes and hydrochemical anomalies typically most studies have focused on earthquake forecasting i e changes prior to earthquakes or co seismic behavior there have been a limited number of studies that discuss the responses of groundwater systems especially focused on the hydrogeologic changes after earthquakes adinolfi falcone et al 2012 amoruso et al 2011 barberio et al 2017 claesson et al 2007 ekemen keskin 2010 galassi et al 2014 lee et al 2013 matsumoto et al 2003 petitta et al 2018 wang and manga 2010 wang et al 2012 yechieli and bein 2002 seismic waves for example are known to cause changes in water level temperature and geochemistry adinolfi falcone et al 2012 matsumoto et al 2003 roeloffs et al 2003 roeloffs 1998 shi et al 2015 wang et al 2012 seismicity can also cause abrupt changes or have long term effects on the environment particularly groundwater systems hydrological responses to seismicity depend on several factors such as the earthquake magnitude distance from the epicenter the chemical and physical properties of the water geological structures permeability and the pore pressure of rocks ekemen keskin 2010 hartmann and levy 2005 petitta et al 2018 for example ekemen keskin 2010 stated that the observed changes in aquifers could be explained using a dilatancy fluid model the response to earthquakes could be attributed to the changes in the water mixing ratio because of aquifer permeability pore pressure and flow path in addition the physical influencing factors can affect the groundwater system ataie ashtiani et al 2001 bodvarsson 1970 bredehoeft 1967 kümpel 1991 kümpel 1992 maréchal et al 2002 shih 2018 wu and zhuang 2010 yan et al 2014 yi et al 2012 locally heterogeneous responses of groundwater

fracture networks allowing groundwater flow gray et al 1991 considering these hydraulic properties some previous studies have proposed the conceptual models for describing the aquifer responses to earthquakes adinolfi falcone et al 2012 amoruso and crescentini 2010 amoruso et al 2011 barberio et al 2017 manga 2001 roeloffs 1998 tokunaga 1999 on september 12 2016 two earthquakes ml 5 1 and ml 5 8 respectively occurred in gyeongju in the southeastern part of the korean peninsula korea meteorological administration the mainshock of the gyeongju events was recorded as the largest earthquake in korea since instrumental seismic monitoring started in korea in 1978 the source mechanism of the gyeongju earthquakes displayed strike slip movement of a branch of the yangsan fault ysf passing through the gyeongju area kim et al 2017b kim et al 2016 slip analysis and earthquake focal mechanism solutions have shown that the ysf is under a regional compressional stress field which might be a result of the continental collision of the pacific eurasian and indian plates jiang et al 2016 park et al 2007 park et al 2006 zoback 1992 gyeongju area is spatially close to the ysf thus the gyeongju events might allow more detailed studies about characteristics of the ysf and its branch faults including groundwater responses after earthquakes the earthquake related indicators in hydrogeology generally include i groundwater level ii temperature iii hydrochemistry and iv isotope concentrations groundwater level monitoring has been broadly used to identify pre co and post earthquake changes brodsky 2003 manga et al 2012 roeloffs 1998 shi et al 2015 wang and manga 2010 seismic waves have been known to affect the groundwater level via oscillations and permanent offsets temperature changes are commonly analyzed using heat transport modeling ekemen keskin 2010 wang et al 2012 earthquake induced changes in groundwater level of the wells would be affected by one of the following phenomena i pore water pressure increase related to compression of alluvial sediments roeloffs 1998 ii pore water pressure decrease in response to the emanation of subsoil gas barberio et al 2017 matsumoto et al 2003 iii a fracture cleaning by pore pressure propagation enhancing the hydraulic conductivity in the aquifer adinolfi falcone et al 2012 iv soil liquefaction of upper crust sediments in response to an applied stress of the event wang and manga 2010 and v the strain sensitivity of a possible weak zone which has low stiffness moduli shear modulus skempton ratio and poisson ratio of the soil or rock medium kümpel 1991 kümpel 1992 in this study groundwater chemistry major elements and some physical chemical parameters ph ec and temperature were monitored among the isotopes oxygen hydrogen and radon 222 were analyzed to determine the effects of the earthquake on groundwater radon 222 particularly has been generally monitored as an earthquake precursor sampled in water or air igarashi et al 1995 king 1978 liu et al 1984 noguchi and wakita 1977 roeloffs 1999 teng 1980 wakita et al 1980 radon 222 is a radioactive nuclide with a half life of approximately 3 8 days it is produced from radium 226 in the natural radioactive decay chain of uranium 228 thus its concentration is proportional to the uranium concentration in adjacent rocks the transport of radon is influenced by fluid advection diffusion partition between the liquid and gas phases and radioactive decay the radon concentration in groundwater is dependent on the specific surface of the rocks hoehn and von gunten 1989 torgersen et al 1990 because the specific surface can be affected by earthquakes the radon concentration can increase or decrease radon 222 also shows significant anomalies at fault zones prior to earthquakes ghosh et al 2009 walia et al 2009 wang and fialko 2015 however a few studies have delineated the response of radon concentration to earthquakes adinolfi falcone et al 2012 igarashi et al 1993 igarashi and wakita 1990 strontium isotopes have been used in only a few earthquake related papers strontium isotopes are useful tracers for groundwater origin and water rock mixing processes because 87sr is the daughter product of the natural decay of radioactive 87rb half life 48 9 ga the 87sr 86sr ratios of the bedrock aquifers were different according to rock types of bedrock frape et al 1984 frost and toner 2004 négrel et al 2004 shand et al 2009 thus strontium isotopes in groundwater can also reveal significant post earthquake anomalies at fault zones according to bedrock type the main objective of this study was to identify hydrogeochemical changes related to the gyeongju earthquake and then suggest a conceptual model of the response of the groundwater systems to the earthquake using the grouping results in accordance with this objective major research results were achieved via i performing a correlation and cluster analysis of hydrochemical parameters with geological characteristics using the som approach ii analyzing pre co and post seismic changes in groundwater level temperature and ec and iii interpreting the results of isotopes radon and strontium sampled following the earthquake based on the grouping these results could help to provide the possible mechanisms of groundwater changes induced by the earthquake the overview of this research is shown in fig 1 2 study area the gyeongju earthquake sequence started with a foreshock ml 5 1 at 10 44 32 utc on september 12 2016 and the mainshock ml 5 8 occurred at 11 32 55 utc korea meteorological administration during the first 10 days following the mainshock more than 120 earthquakes of ml 2 0 were recorded in the epicentral region the earthquakes including the mainshock and strong aftershocks ml 3 5 are listed in table 1 the korean peninsula is composed of three major precambrian massifs the nangrim gyeonggi and youngnam from north to the south the gyeongsang basin is the northern part of the youngnam massif and the yangsan fault system has developed in the eastern part of the gyeongsang basin the yangsan fault system is a group of nne trending major strike slip faults the gyeongju earthquake and its abundant aftershocks occurred near the ysf fig 2 a which has a linear expression for approximately 200 km and is the longest major fault of the yangsan fault system kyung and lee 2006 the displacement of the fault varies between 21 km and 35 km depending on the location and the arrangement of the granitic rocks in this area indicates cenozoic dextral strike slip of 21 3 km in the n 20 e direction along the ysf line hwang et al 2007 hwang et al 2004 since lee and na 1983 first suggested that a quaternary reactivation of the yangsan fault system could be possible a number of seismic geological and geophysical studies have proved its seismic activation kyung and lee 1999 kyung and lee 2006 lee and jin 1991 the gyeongju area has been subject to most of the large historical earthquakes that have occurred in korea initial movement on the ysf was recorded to have occurred before 45 ma based on radiometric dating of volcanic rocks chang et al 1990 age dating using the accelerator mass spectrometry ams method indicates late quaternary movement of the ysf between 2400 and 2000 yrs bp and an average vertical slip rate of approximately 0 04 0 05 mm yr kyung and chang 2001 recent measurement of the vertical slip rate of ysf reported less than 0 1 mm yr on average 0 02 0 07 mm yr in the southern part and 0 03 0 05 mm yr in the northern part kyung 2003 kyung and lee 2006 indicating that the ysf has been seismically active paleo stress analyses have noted that the stress regime of the ysf has changed more than three times kang and ryoo 2009 kim et al 1996 and during the quaternary the ene wsw maximum compression is in agreement with the first order stress field in east asia chang et al 2010 heidbach et al 2010 zoback 1992 trench analysis of the yugye fault the youngest quaternary fault in the northern part of the ysf also yielded a nw se or wnw ene compressional local maximum principal stress kim and jin 2006 for the gyeongju event also under this ene wnw compression geophysical studies of the aftershocks recognized the subsurface fault plane has a strike of nne 25 30 and a dip of 65 74 with a depth ranging from 11 km to 16 km the width of the distribution of event locations is approximately 5 km in length and was determined to be a branch of the ysf hong et al 2017 kim et al 2017a lee et al 2018 son et al 2017 twelve wells are located near the ysf and the surrounding area within the gyeongsang basin fig 2b the information for each well is shown in table 2 the wells generally were installed by two types at each point the one well as labeled kw indicates that the sampling point is consisted of only one type well bedrock aquifer well the alluvial aquifer wells were labeled kw 1 and the bedrock aquifer wells were labeled kw or kw 2 the kw 11 3 refers the surface water sample near the kw 11 well the lithostratigraphic unit indicates the characteristic of the bedrock aquifer wells labeled as kw 2 the gyeongsang basin is mainly composed of cretaceous and tertiary non marine sediments and igneous rocks fig 2b middle cretaceous hayang group sediments late cretaceous yucheon group rocks early miocene yeonil group rocks middle miocene janggi group and bulguksa group granitic rocks which intruded the cretaceous rocks during the late cretaceous to early tertiary chang et al 1990 chang 1975 chang 1977 chang 1978 the lithology of each stratigraphic unit as documented in detail by the korea institute of geoscience and mineral resources kigam can be briefly characterized as follows the hayang group is mostly composed of clastic sedimentary rocks including shale mudstone and sandstone with mafic or intermediate volcanic rocks the yucheon group consists of andesitic rocks and quartz andesites including plagioclase phenocrysts the yeonil group and janggi group consist of early and middle miocene sedimentary and volcanic rocks that are mainly exposed in the eastern part of the gyeongsang basin the

obtained from the national groundwater monitoring network ngmn of the korea water resources corporation http www gims go kr the hourly data which was monitored every hour on the hour was used for analyzing the earthquake responses comparing before during and after an earthquake precipitation data mm obtained from the korea meteorological administration was also analyzed with the water level variations http kma go kr these daily data correspond to the cumulative quantities during the day sampling of groundwater wells in alluvial and bedrock aquifers was conducted for three days january 16 2017 to january 18 2017 four months after the earthquake total 22 water samples including 11 groundwater samples from the bedrock aquifer 9 groundwater samples from the alluvial aquifer and one surface water sample were collected in 2 l polyethylene bottles using a grundfos mp 1 pump although the sample location for two aquifer wells is same the groundwater sources are completely separated by different boreholes thus we can assume that groundwater mixing between two aquifer systems did not happen during purging out or sampling the groundwater the sampled water was analyzed for hydrochemical parameters major ions radon concentration and strontium isotopes the hydrogeochemical parameters such as temperature ec dissolved oxygen do total dissolved solids tds ph and salinity were measured in the field using an ysi prodss digital sampling system xylem usa when the real time measured values of those parameters were constant the groundwater was sampled for 22 wells the analysis of cations and anions na k ca mg cl no3 so4 and hco3 including strontium isotopes was completed using filtered water samples at the korea basic science institute kbsi 87sr 86sr ratios were obtained using a neptune multicollector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer mc icp ms thermo finnigan germany upgraded with a large dry interface pump yields were approximately 100 and the matrix concentration did not exceed 1 of the strontium concentrations the total procedural blanks were negligible with less than 1 ng of sr the 87sr 86sr ratios were normalized to 86sr 88sr 0 1194 faure 1986 and the mean 87sr 86sr ratio of nbs987 u s national bureau of standards was 0 710247 0 000017 2σ n 18 the radon concentrations in the groundwater samples were measured using rtm1688 2 of sarad an air bubbling 500 ml flask was filled with sampled water and connected to the monitor for a closed air loop the measurement was conducted at 15 min intervals the attained values were calibrated adjusting for the short half life of radon the unit offers a high sensitivity of better than 3 cpm kbq m3 obtained from a very small internal volume of only 130 ml 3 2 self organizing map som self organizing map som analysis is a neural network organized on a low dimensional array of processing units kohonen 1982 the som consists of two layers the input layer and the output layer neurons layer these two layers are interconnected via a weight vector the neurons in the output layer are connected to adjacent neurons by a neighborhood relation dictating the structure of the topographic map in this study the layer of neurons was arranged onto a two dimensional grid the som is an unsupervised learning algorithm without prior information of classification the learning algorithm procedure can be described as follows i determine the number of neurons ii initialize the weight vectors with small random values iii choose the best matching neurons or the best matching unit bmu that is the closest to the input vector and iv update the best matching neurons and neighboring neurons the results can be visualized using two different types of map the component planes and the u matrix vesanto 1999 the component plane representation visualizes relative component values of the weight vectors providing correlations between components the u matrix i e the unified distance matrix enables clustering analysis using the distance between the weight vectors and their neighborhood the simulation was completed using the som toolbox 2 0 for matlab 5 vesanto and alhoniemi 2000 4 results 4 1 groundwater level temperature and ec changes groundwater level changes in seven monitoring wells can be classified into three types i no change related to the earthquake kw 5 1 and kw 5 2 ii maintenance after an instantaneous increase or decrease kw 8 1 kw 8 2 and kw 11 2 and iii recovery to original values after a sudden change kw 11 1 fig 3 the two sigma thresholds were marked as lines the other groundwater level variations were shown in supplementary fig s1 the groundwater level of the kw 5 wells did not change regardless of earthquake showing the data was included in the range between 2σ and 2σ fig 3a at the kw 8 wells there was an abrupt increase during the earthquake and maintenance after the earthquake particularly in the bedrock aquifer well which is out of the range between 2σ and 2σ kw 8 2 fig 3b the groundwater level response to the earthquake in the alluvial aquifer well was in contrast to that in the bedrock aquifer well at the kw 11 wells fig 3c the groundwater level of kw 11 1 slightly increased before the earthquake and then decreased however the groundwater level of kw 11 2 drastically decreased and then gradually recovered and it remained at higher values compared to the original values kw 11 2 also showed the water level variations which are out of the range between 2σ and 2σ indicating that the anomalies related to the earthquakes followed the two sigma rule groundwater temperature changes only occurred at the kw 11 wells fig 4 a these also showed an opposite change pattern in which the groundwater temperature of kw 11 1 recovered to the original value after an instantaneous increase whereas that of kw 11 2 recovered after a slight decrease this anomaly was apparent in the alluvial aquifer well kw 11 1 unlike the groundwater level anomaly a change in groundwater ecs was observed at eight monitoring wells before during or after the earthquake kw 1 responded to the earthquake in a peak form and gradually recovered kw 2 showed an increase prior to the earthquake and recovered to original values the groundwater ec consistently decreased and then remained at lower values at kw 6 1 kw 6 2 and kw 10 2 the peak form of the kw 11 wells also indicated an opposite direction fig 4b kw 11 1 peaked at a higher level several times prior to the earthquake while kw 11 2 peaked at a lower level before the earthquake and then recovered compared to the water level data however it was difficult to interpret that the changes in ec could be attributed to the earthquake 4 2 hydrogeochemical characteristics including isotopes radon and strontium the hydrogeochemical data of 17 parameters na k ca mg cl no3 so4 hco3 temperature ph do ec tds salinity sr 87sr 86sr and radon were collected from 21 groundwater samples and one surface water sample kw 11 3 in january 2017 the analytical results of the water samples are summarized in table 3 the na values were high in kw 4 1 kw 4 2 and kw 6 2 100 mg l and the cl values were high in kw 4 1 and kw 4 2 100 mg l the kw 4 1 and kw 4 2 had especially high ec and salinity values the so4 values were high in kw 1 and kw 10 2 200 mg l the distribution of radon concentration in the 21 groundwater samples is shown in fig 5 the radon concentration ranged from 225 bq m3 to 23 060 bq m3 in the gyeongju area see table 3 the kw 5 1 kw 5 2 and kw 8 2 values were 15849 17575 and 23 060 bq m3 respectively which were higher values than those of the other groundwater wells these wells are near the epicenter lower values 1000 bq m3 were found in kw6 1 kw 6 2 kw 7 1 kw 9 1 kw 9 2 kw 10 1 kw 10 2 and kw 11 1 the values between the alluvial and bedrock aquifer wells were similar in kw 4 kw 5 kw 6 and kw 7 the value difference between two formation wells was high in kw 8 kw 10 and kw 11 kw 7 kw 9 and kw 11 showed an anomaly in which the alluvial aquifer well had a higher radon concentration than the bedrock aquifer well the strontium isotopic compositions of groundwater samples in the gyeongju area are shown in fig 6 strontium concentrations ranged from 18 1 ppb to 4052 ppb the 87sr 86sr values ranged from 0 705688 to 0 712368 see table 3 in the alluvial aquifer wells the 87sr 86sr values ranged from 0 706191 to 0 708353 and these values were from 0 705688 to 0 712368 in the bedrock aquifer wells the strontium isotopic compositions of the groundwater samples also reflected distinct ratios based on their lithology and stratigraphy the hayang group kw 1 kw 2 kw 9 2 and kw 10 2 had high strontium concentrations the 87sr 86sr values of the bulguksa group kw 3 kw 5 2 and kw 12 2 ranged from 0 706575 to 0 708022 cretaceous volcanic rocks kw 8 2 and kw 11 2 are below the bulguksa group the kw 6 wells had distinct characteristics in which kw 6 1 was far from kw 6 2 the spatial distributions of strontium concentrations and 87sr 86sr are shown in fig 7 exceptionally high strontium concentrations were observed in kw 1 kw 2 and kw 10 2 3000 ppb whereas kw 3 kw 4 1 kw 6 1 kw 6 2 kw 7 2 kw 8 2 kw 10 3 kw 11 1 had significantly low values 100 ppb the wells that had high strontium concentrations were in the hayang group for the 87sr 86sr results kw 1 kw 2 kw 6 2 kw 10 2 and kw 11 2 had high ratio values while kw 3 kw 6 1 kw 7 1 kw 8 2 and kw 11 1 had low ratio values the values between the alluvial and bedrock aquifer wells were quite different in kw 6 kw 8 kw 10 and kw 11 calcium and strontium cation contents of the groundwater samples showed various distributions ranging from 1 59 mg l to 94 89 mg l for calcium and from 18 1 ppb to 4052 ppb for strontium concentration fig 8 the sr2 cation contents of the hayang group ranged from 18 1 ppb to 4052 ppb which was much higher than the values generally measured in groundwater as hundreds of ppb frost and toner 2004 santoni et al 2016 most groundwater wells located along the linear path except kw 2 kw 4 2 and kw 11 2 kw 9 1 and kw 10 1 had high values among alluvial aquifer wells 4 3 self organizing map som there are few studies using som for groundwater quality data interpretation choi et al 2014 hong and rosen 2001 lischeid 2008 however we used the som analysis for statistical analysis in the gyeongju area because it can solve linear dimensionality reduction problems without biases this method also provides the detailed local relationship between the variables by the component planes which is helpful to understand groundwater systems visually in the study this statistical analysis was conducted using hydrochemical parameters of each well at different locations for spatial interpretation not time series data at one well the contribution map of the variables is shown in the component map fig 9 each component plane represents the average component value at each node in a certain color the white indicates the high values and the deep brown indicates the low values the dataset contained data regarding 16 variables na k ca mg cl no3 so4 hco3 sr 87sr 86sr temperature ph do ec tds and salinity see table 3 the raw data were normalized in order to work with transformed quantities with zero mean and unit standard deviation by comparing component planes the planes of ca so4 sr and 87sr 86sr show similar distributions indicating a strong correlation between these variables the na cl hco3 ec tds and salinity values also had similar patterns to each other these variables show vertical symmetry with the planes of ca so4 sr and 87sr 86sr the components of temperature ph do k and no3 are distinct from each other showing no relationship with the other variables the clustering could be investigated with the visual inspection of the u matrix result fig 10 deep brown shades on the u matrix indicate a large distance between neighborhood nodes whereas white shades correspond to a short distance between nodes based on the distances the distribution of water samples could be classified into four groups group 1 kw 1 kw 2 kw 9 1 and kw 10 1 group 2 kw 3 kw 5 1 kw 5 2 kw 6 2 kw 11 3 and kw 12 1 group 3 kw 4 1 and kw 4 2 and group 4 kw 8 1 kw 11 1 and kw 11 2 the classification has similar results with the classification based on lithostratigraphic unit data although the results did not include all water samples group 1 has relatively high values of ca mg so4 no3 sr and 87sr 86sr group 2 falls between group 3 and group 4 group 3 is characterized by distinctly high values in k na cl hco3 ec tds and salinity group 4 has high do values and a distinct low temperature and 87sr 86sr with relatively low values of ec tds salinity and sr 5 discussion 5 1 groundwater level temperature and ec changes the gyeongju earthquake on september 12 2016 remarkably affected the groundwater systems the total data showing anomalies are shown in table 4 the groundwater level temperature and ec data were analyzed considering pre co and post seismic changes three anomaly types were observed in the groundwater level data see fig 3 the maintenance of a groundwater level increase could be attributed to aquifer compaction as observed in kw 8 1 and kw 8 2 lee et al 2002 there is a possibility that the aquifers underwent non recoverable deformation the persistent groundwater level changes also have been influenced by volumetric strain changes matsumoto et al 2003 roeloffs et al 2003 wang et al 2007 in contrast a greater decrease in groundwater level prior to the earthquake could be attributed to the opening of bedrock fractures as observed in kw 11 1 fleeger et al 1999 kitagawa et al 2006 rojstaczer and wolf 1992 rojstaczer et al 1995 wang et al 2004 a decrease could also possibly be related to a change in permeability brodsky 2003 manga and wang 2007 there is another anomaly an opposite change pattern between the alluvial and bedrock aquifer wells as observed in all datasets of groundwater level temperature and ec data for kw 11 see figs 3 and 4 this means that the two wells had weak interactions with each other groundwater level oscillation also depends on the interactions between inflow outflow of the well and of the aquifer cooper et al 1965 however it was difficult to be revealed in our data because our time resolution of groundwater level data is relatively long 1 h in addition one important physical influencing factor the earth tide is negligible or not influencial because earth tide can cause relatively small fluctuations from a few centimeters to tens of centimeters compared to the observed anomaly caused by the earthquakes in this study from a few meters to tens of meters shi et al 2015 moreover the rock type hosting kw8 and kw 11 wells is felsic volcanic rocks which tend to have the higher range of elastic stiffness moduli compared to that of sedimentary rocks or unconsolidated sediments kümpel 1992 therefore the groundwater level change of both wells would not be related to their whole rock rigid lithology high stiffness moduli but probably with the distribution of a weak zone in their aquifer in other words the groundwater level changes in the igneous rock aquifers would imply the location of the bottom end of the wells in contact with a massive hydraulic fracture zone in the rocks kind of an artificial weak zone kümpel 1992 5 2 isotopic data radon and strontium the hydrogeochemical data of 17 parameters na k ca mg cl no3 so4 hco3 temperature ph do ec tds salinity sr 87sr 86sr and radon were collected only after earthquake jan 2017 a difference in radon concentration between the alluvial and bedrock aquifer wells could be considered more significant because of the mixing effect as observed in kw 8 and kw 11 see fig 5 seismotectonic activity may often change the mixing ratio of groundwater in a well claesson et al 2007 hartmann and levy 2005 the anomaly in which the alluvial aquifer well had a higher radon concentration than that of the bedrock aquifer could be attributed to rainfall however in this area rainfall did not occur during the sampling period as observed in kw 7 kw 9 and kw 11 the large variation in the 87sr 86sr ratios in the groundwater can consequently largely be explained by the nature of the aquifer lithology see figs 6 and 7 for example the high rb sr ratio of composite silicate minerals such as feldspar and biotite can cause granitic bedrock to be highly radiogenic frost and toner 2004 santoni et al 2016 generally cretaceous granites comprising the gyeongsang basin had a strontium concentration from 62 ppm to 428 ppm and an 87sr 86sr ratio from 0 704610 to 0 711400 cheong and jo 2017 basaltic rocks near the yeonil group and janggi group had strontium concentration from 439 ppm to 518 ppm and the 87sr 86sr ratio from 0 703850 to 0 704630 shimazu et al 1990 in the chaeyaksan basaltic volcanics of the yucheon group strontium concentration ranged from 731 ppm to 1667 ppm and the 87sr 86sr ratio from 0 705870 to 0 706440 yun 1998 thus samples of the bulguksa granite would be more radiogenic than those of the yucheon group rocks because of the composite minerals of the bulguksa granite plagioclase feldspar and biotite which have high 87sr 86sr ratios the strong correlation between strontium and calcium could indicate the chemical signature such as water rock interactions see fig 8 the outlier kw 2 kw 4 2 and kw 11 2 can indicate another chemical mechanism such as other water source the high values of kw 9 1 and kw 10 1 can suggest the influence from the kw 9 2 and kw 10 2 5 3 the conceptual model with the grouping results this paper is to combine the hydrologic hydrogeochemical and lithostratigraphic characteristics by applying the neural network method som the som results using the hydrogeochemical data showed the 4 groups however these did not include kw 6 1 kw 7 1 kw 7 2 kw 8 2 kw 9 2 kw 10 2 and kw 12 2 in the u matrix for including all groundwater samples the new grouping was conducted to reflect the two grouping results lithostratigraphic unit and the som the som results were also in agreement with the lithostratigraphic unit data which was used usefully in arranging the bedrock aquifer wells based on bedrock characteristics especially this statistical method could consider the factor of external effects e g earthquakes as well as the major ions it is useful because the public activity generally has existed around the groundwater wells among other methods in general piper diagram provides relative proportions of water rock interactions which is difficult to indicate directly the external effects other than geologic characteristics thus by using the two results the final grouping yielded four classes of wells group a kw 1 kw 2 kw 9 and kw 10 group b kw 3 kw 5 and kw 12 group c kw 4 kw 6 and kw 7 and group d kw 8 and kw 11 this is conducted by binding the alluvial and bedrock aquifer wells the dependencies between the variables hydrochemical parameters including strontium isotopes could be interpreted with the component plane results from the som see fig 9 these correlations were also used for analyzing the possible mechanisms at each group the lithology and stratigraphy of group a are classified as hayang group shale and sandstone of low porosity and high strontium concentrations particularly the kw 9 and the kw 10 wells had a low radon concentration 1000 bq m3 high strontium concentration high ca value low 87sr 86sr ratio and low ph see figs 8 and 9 there might be some possible mechanisms for the exceptionally strong chemical signatures regarding earthquakes first the fine grained bedrock of group a has a large reactive surface area that can effectively activate water rock interaction and largely vary the groundwater chemistry via ion exchange pennisi et al 2006 second particularly for kw 10 2 in group a the exceptionally high sr samples appear to be an effect of cation exchange between the soil and surrounding water the capacity of the cation bearing soil cation exchange capacity cec depends on the ph of the surrounding water and the cec of a soil generally show decreases with ph decreases sparks 2003 the acidic water of kw10 2 ph 2 27 would lead to lower cec and lead to leaching of ca2 and sr2 from the soil to surrounding groundwater the flow into the groundwater in the hayang group rocks could increase the chemical concentration of group a third the results could be attributed to geological characteristics not related to the earthquake as the intrinsic chemistry of the hayang group shale and sandstone might affect the strontium concentrations such dramatically high values of sr were previously observed in the redbeds aquifer from 885 ppb to 7851 ppb where the lithology of the bedrock is composed of shale and sandstone with high rb sr ratios santoni et al 2016 moreover by the som results kw 1 kw 2 kw 9 1 and kw 10 1 were clustered as one group see fig 10 also suggesting the strong influence from bedrock to shallow aquifer group b wells are located in biotite granitic region of the bulguksa group which has a typical high radon concentration the radon concentration is greatly influenced by uranium content thus its concentration is generally high in granite compared to that of sedimentary rocks typically uranium concentration is high in granites whereas it is low in sedimentary rocks however only the kw 5 wells had a high radon concentration in particular kw 5 1 had high values similar to those of kw 5 2 this could be attributed to deep fluid upwelling from the bedrock in the kw 5 wells chiodini et al 2000 minissale 2004 savoy et al 2011 group c is composed of tuff and tuffaceous sedimentary rocks of the yeonil and janggi groups this group had a low radon concentration and a small difference in radon concentration between the alluvial and the bedrock aquifer wells see fig 5 suggesting active water mixing between the two aquifers in addition the bedrock of this area contains conglomerates which generally have high pore density leading to active mixing with water compared to the shale dominant lithology this hypothesis seems to be consistent with the weak chemical signature of group a kw 4 1 kw 4 2 and kw 6 2 had high values of ec cl tds and salinity values see table 3 and fig 9 suggesting the possibility of sea water intrusion by the effects of the earthquakes in group d the radon concentration was quite different between the two wells and the groundwater level anomaly occurred see figs 3 and 5 the wells of this group are in cretaceous mainly andesitic volcanic rocks this group showed obvious anomaly caused by the earthquakes with the annual data the maintenance of a groundwater level increase was observed in kw 8 wells kw 11 wells in particular showed many factors including groundwater level temperature and ec responded to the earthquake in an opposite manner see figs 3 and 4 the wells of kw8 and kw11 are located in the trigger zone compressional region in the coulomb stress field of the gyeongju events hong et al 2017 the compressional stress in the trigger zone would induce a decrease of hydraulic diffusion and a change of pore pressure which may result in maintenance of water level wang et al 2004 kw 11 2 which showed the greater decrease of groundwater level prior to the earthquake suggested the possibility of the opening of bedrock fractures or liquefaction roeloffs 1998 moreover in a fractal analysis conducted near the wells of kw8 and kw11 many examples of the fracture network which have developed since early tertiary are investigated to have a correlation with recent evolution of the yangsan fault park et al 2010 in addition the sr contents of group b and group d showed a wide range of concentrations observed in other studies of groundwater in the granitic bedrock aquifers e g an sr2 from 67 to 169 ppb frost and toner 2004 and from 103 to 553 ppb santoni et al 2016 this wide range might be associated with the different amount of plagioclase in each matrix rock of the groundwater water flow via granite can be controlled by the dissolution of anorthite and alkali feldspar the former occurs more rapidly providing ca2 and sr2 with a low 87sr 86sr ratio see figs 8 and 9 bullen et al 1997 franklyn et al 1991 négrel 2006 in contrast one groundwater chemistry study in canada showed that dissolution of alkali feldspar can increase the 87sr 86sr ratio providing sodium and potassium bullen et al 1996 therefore the various compositions of the granite and the fluid mobility would be determinative in the 87sr 86sr ratio in accordance with this analysis conceptual models of groundwater changes induced by the earthquakes can be suggested fig 11 four different models were inferred by data analysis and the grouping result using the som approach first a response highlighting the mixing with deep groundwater or bedrock can be attributed to a deep fluid rise which resulted in high strontium concentrations as observed in the wells of group a kw 1 and kw 2 in addition low radon values and high 87sr 86sr ratios were observed in the wells of the alluvial aquifer kw 9 1 and kw 10 1 second the possibility of non recoverable deformation after deep fluid upwelling can be suggested as there was no change in water level and there were high radon concentrations in both wells of the alluvial and bedrock aquifers kw 5 1 and kw 5 2 in group b this hypothesis can be supported by studies showing that the stress reduction after an earthquake causes closure of cracks king and cocco 2001 nur and booker 1972 peng and zhao 2009 scholz 2002 scholz et al 1973 the other wells of group b could be classified as an uninfluenced by the earthquakes third another mechanism the strong interaction between shallow and deep aquifers can be attributed to sea water intrusion by the data showing a small difference in radon concentration between the alluvial and the bedrock aquifer wells as observed in group c finally the response to the movement of the strike slip fault can be explained considering the location of group d which is near the ysf the water level anomaly suggests the potential that the source of the alluvial aquifer well changed a different source compared to that of bedrock aquifer well after the earthquakes see fig 3 bedrock fracture opening could cause a decrease in water level suggesting that surrounding aquifer affected the alluvial aquifer of these wells because of the difference in water level as observed in kw 11 2 in contrast the groundwater level appeared to remain constant at a higher value than the pre earthquake value via aquifer compaction because of the movement of the strike slip fault at the kw 8 wells 6 conclusion the 2016 gyeongju earthquakes affected the pre co and post earthquake groundwater systems changes were observed in groundwater level temperature ec hydrochemistry radon 222 and strontium isotopic data the main findings obtained via data analysis from 21 monitoring wells are as follows 1 the observed groundwater level anomaly could be attributed to pre earthquakes effect not a seasonal effect maintenance persistent or abrupt changes and oscillation of water levels were observed in some wells 2 the radon concentration could be interpreted as the difference between alluvial and bedrock aquifer wells a relatively small difference between two radon values implies active mixing processes between the shallow and deep aquifers 3 strontium isotopes were interpreted with the lithology and stratigraphy of bedrock indicating the potential of water rock interactions these isotopes sr2 concentrations and 87sr 86sr ratio also could suggest both geologically independent causes and dependent causes with respect to the earthquakes 4 the som statistic tool was found to be useful for identifying each group having common characteristics and the influence of the earthquakes on hydrogeochemical parameters the final grouping can explain the possible mechanisms via different hydrogeochemical processes i water rock interactions because of deep fluid rising ii no response to the earthquakes or non recoverable deformation after the earthquakes iii aquifer mixing vertically due to sea water intrusion and iv the effect of the movement of the strike slip fault these results can have significant impact on regional and national authorities because seismicity has increased in the area near gyeongju since 2016 it may be more helpful in efficiently managing groundwater systems to analyze the combined hydrogeochemical and lithostratigraphic characteristics of the area in addition the studied parameters and the adopted methods would be positively applied for other earthquake zones particularly for grouping interpretation of responses of monitoring wells acknowledgments this work was supported by the
