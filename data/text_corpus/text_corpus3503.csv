17515,chlorine dioxide clo2 can be used as a pre oxidant when chloramination is performed in water treatment plants however the effects of clo2 pre oxidation on the formation of nitrogenous disinfection by products such as dichloroacetonitrile dcan and dichloroacetamide dcacam during chloramination are not well understood in this study the effects of clo2 pre oxidation on the formation of dcan and dcacam during chloramination of 28 model compounds and seven real water samples were investigated the sources of nitrogen for dcan and dcacam formation were investigated using 15n labeled monochloramine clo2 pre oxidation affected dcan and dcacam formation during chloramination of model compounds in different ways clo2 pre oxidation increased unlabeled and 15n labeled dcan and dcacam formation during chloramination of six amino acids and peptides and five indoles and tertiary amines clo2 pre oxidation decreased dcan formation but increased dcacam formation during chloramination of three hydroxybenzamide compounds but had the opposite effects for four tetracyclines clo2 pre oxidation generally decreased dcan and dcacam formation during chloramination of the phenolic compounds that are precursors not containing nitrogen 2 aminoacetophenone formamid trans muconic acid and unsaturated ketones were found to be transformation products of clo2 oxidation of 3 methylindole salicylamide and resorcinol respectively possible dcan and dcacam formation pathways during chloramination after clo2 oxidation were identified for most of the water samples clo2 pre oxidation decreased the amounts of dcan and dcacam formed during chloramination by 36 70 and 11 59 respectively this may have been caused by clo2 oxidation destroying phenolic precursors and macromolecular proteins rather than amino acids in the water samples graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords chlorine dioxide clo2 chloramination nitrogenous disinfection byproducts n dbps dichloroacetamide dcacam water treatment 1 introduction monochloramine nh2cl an alternative disinfectant to chlorine is widely used in drinking water treatment plants to control the formation of regulated disinfection by products dbps such as trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas the disinfectant species when chlorine is added will be chloramines rather than free chlorine if the water being treated contains ammonia at a high concentration qiang and adams 2004 however chloramination promotes the formation of certain nitrogenous dbps n dbps such as nitrosamines and haloacetamides hacams bond et al 2012 chu et al 2013 huang et al 2012 2017 moreover nitrification may occur in water distribution systems that contain chloramines zhang et al 2009 and elevated n dbp concentrations can be caused by n dbp precursors being released from nitrifying biofilms liew et al 2016 zeng et al 2016 haloacetonitriles hans and hacams are n dbps that are of great concern because they are more cytotoxic and genotoxic than thms and haas muellner et al 2007 plewa et al 2008 dichloroacetonitrile dcan and dichloroacetamide dcacam are the most representative hans and hacams species respectively found in chloraminated water in terms of occurrence frequencies and concentrations kosaka et al 2016 huang et al 2017 dcan and dcacam formation during chloramination therefore have attracted much attention many previous studies have used amino acids and peptides as model precursors to investigate dcan and dcacam formation during chloramination huang et al 2012 bond et al 2012 yang et al 2012 more recently more nitrogenous organic compounds including indoles tertiary amines and amide containing compounds e g hydroxybenzamides have been found to be important precursors of dcan and dcacam linge et al 2020 ding et al 2018 sfynia et al 2020 tetracycline antibiotics which are also amide containing compounds frequently detected in surface water danner et al 2019 are found to yield 0 43 1 31 m m of dcan during chloramination zhou et al 2014 and supposed to be potent precursors of dcacam organic nitrogen species or chloramines can act as the sources of nitrogen in dcan and dcacam formed during chloramination of nitrogenous organic compounds and the two sources can be distinguished using 15n labeled nh2cl 15n nh2cl for dbp formation studies huang et al 2012 yang et al 2012 phenol and resorcinol can produce more dcan and dcacam using nitrogen from nh2cl than some nitrogenous organics e g tryptophan and tyrosine during chloramination suggesting that non nitrogenous organic compounds e g phenols serve as an important pool of dcan and dcacam precursors during chloramination le roux et al 2016 chlorine dioxide clo2 is often used as a pre oxidant to control dbp formation because it has a strong oxidation capacity and does not readily cause halogenated dbps to form yang et al 2013 yao et al 2018 clo2 however forms inorganic byproducts chlorite and chlorate upon its reaction with water constituents chlorite is generally the primary product and is regulated by u s epa and other regulatory agencies worldwide however chlorite can inhibit nitrification in a chloraminated distribution system mcguire et al 2006 2009 rahman et al 2011 therefore the use of clo2 in combination with post chloramination may avoid the occurrence of nitrification in distribution systems on the other hand clo2 pre oxidation can selectively transform the dbp precursors e g amine containing and phenolic compounds through electron transfer reaction and thus alter their dbp formation potential during chloramination hoigné and bader 1994 yang et al 2013 clo2 pre oxidation has been found to decrease the formation of haas nitrosamines and dcan during chloramination of surface water yang et al 2013 lee et al 2007 but to increase dcan formation during chloramination of tyrosine based amino acids yao et al 2018 however little information is available on the effects of clo2 pre oxidation on dcacam formation during chloramination although dcan hydrolysis forms dcacam dcacam can be formed via pathways that do not involve dcan hydrolysis huang et al 2012 it remains unclear whether clo2 pre oxidation affects dcacam formation during chloramination in similar ways to how it affects dcan formation as such the goal of this study was to investigate the effects of clo2 pre oxidation on dcan and dcacam formation during chloramination 28 model precursors including 20 nitrogenous organic compounds and eight non nitrogenous organic compounds fig 1 and seven real water samples from different sources were used the yields of dcan and dcacam during chloramination of the model compounds and real water samples with and without clo2 pre oxidation were compared nitrogenous organics and nh2cl that supplied nitrogen to form dcan and dcacam were identified using 15n nh2cl and the intermediates were determined to allow the pathways for dcan and dcacam formation during chloramination with and without clo2 pre oxidation to be proposed 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and solutions accustandard dcan 98 was supplied by sigma aldrich usa dcacam 98 and 1 2 dibromopropane 98 were obtained from alfa aesar usa methyl tert butyl ether mtbe hplc grade was purchased from thermo fisher scientific usa the suppliers and purities of the model compounds are shown in table s1 stock solutions of the model compounds in ultrapure water or methanol depending on the solubility of each compound were prepared the presence of methanol caused negligible amounts of dcan and dcacam to form with or without clo2 pre oxidation table s2 nh2cl and 15n labeled nh2cl stock solutions were prepared daily by adding sodium hypochlorite to ammonium chloride and 15n labeled ammonium chloride 98 sigma aldrich solutions at a ratio of 0 8 mol mol respectively huang et al 2012 the concentrations of nh2cl and dichloramine nhcl2 in stock nh2cl solutions were quantified by monitoring absorbances at 245 and 295 nm and solving simultaneous equations schreiber and mitch 2005 and nhcl2 concentrations were negligible a clo2 solution was prepared from gaseous clo2 by slowly adding dilute h2so4 to a sodium chlorite solution following a standard method apha 1998 the clo2 concentration was determined using a hach dr2800 portable photometer hash loveland co usa by the diethyl p phenylene diamine colorimetric method apha 1998 2 2 water samples surface water samples labeled s1 s5 were collected from the influents of five drinking water utilities and wastewater effluent samples labeled w1 and w2 were collected from the effluents of two wastewater treatment plants in guangdong province china each sample was passed through a 0 45 µm membrane filter to remove particles and stored at 4 c until it was used the characteristics of the water samples are shown in table s3 2 3 experimental procedures each experiment was conducted under headspace free conditions in a 60 ml amber glass bottle shielded from light at room temperature 25 0 0 5 c each sample was buffered to ph 7 0 with 10 mm phosphate buffer a solution containing the selected model compound 0 1 mm except for the tetracycline antibiotics or real water sample was pre oxidized by clo2 at the specified dose for 30 min the dose of clo2 was 2 5 clo2 precursor molar ratio for model compounds except for the tetracycline antibiotics and the doses of clo2 were 0 5 1 5 clo2 dissolved organic carbon doc mass ratio for water samples after 30 min oxidation time the residual clo2 concentration was determined table s4 before the clo2 was completely removed by bubbling nitrogen through the solution gan et al 2019 the concentrations of dcan and dcacam formed after clo2 pre oxidation of the model compounds or water samples were negligible compared with those formed during chloramination table s5 zhong et al 2019 nh2cl or 15n labeled nh2cl was then added to a model compound solution to give a nh2cl precursor molar ratio of 10 or to a water sample at a dose of 3 doc mg c l 5 no2 n mg n l following a method previously described by hu et al 2010 after 72 h chloramination time except for the tetracycline antibiotics the residual chloramine was quenched by adding a stoichiometric amount of ascorbic acid then the samples were extracted immediately for dbp analysis the tetracycline antibiotics were found to consume clo2 and nh2cl much faster than other model compounds and produced a very large amount of dcacam during chloramination from preliminary experiments so the concentration of tetracycline antibiotic in the solution was reduced to 0 05 mm the doses of clo2 increased to 10 clo2 precursor molar ratio for pre oxidation and the chloramination time was shortened to 24 h the effects of clo2 pre oxidation on dcan and dcacam formation during chloramination of tetracycline antibiotics were consistent when the experimental conditions were changed fig s1 3 methylindole 3 min salicylamide 2 hba and 4 hydroxybenzamide 4 hba were used to investigate the intermediates formed during clo2 oxidation and chloramination a solution containing 3 min 2 hba or 4 hba 0 1 mm was dosed with clo2 at the desired concentration 0 25 mm and incubated at ph 7 0 for 2 h the solution was then extracted with mtbe and the extract was analyzed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms the intermediates formed during clo2 oxidation of 2 hba were further analyzed by liquid chromatography quadrupole time of flight high resolution mass spectrometry lc qtof ms by performing direct aqueous injections experiments using bovine serum albumin bsa 98 sigma aldrich were also performed to investigate the effects of clo2 pre oxidation on dbp formation the bsa solutions 4 mg l doc were pre oxidized by clo2 at designed dosages 0 6 mg l for 30 min and then were chloraminated for 72 h by adding 15 mg l 15n labeled nh2cl 2 4 analytical methods the total chlorine concentration was determined using a hanna hi96711 colorimetric analyzer hanna instruments woonsocket ri usa the doc and dissolved organic nitrogen don concentrations were determined using a toc vcph total organic carbon analyzer with a tnm l total nitrogen module shimadzu kyoto japan the don concentration was measured after electrodialysis of the sample zhu et al 2015 the ammonia nitrate and nitrite concentrations were determined using hanna hi96700 hi96728 and hi96707 portable photometers hanna instruments respectively the analytical methods of n dbps and the intermediates are described in detail in text s1 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of clo2 pre oxidation on the formation and nitrogen origins of dcan and dcacam from model compounds 3 1 1 dbp formation from nitrogenous compounds and the origins of nitrogen in the dbps fig 2 shows the formation of dcan and dcacam during chloramination of the 20 nitrogenous compounds with and without clo2 pre oxidation unlabeled n dbps 14n dcan and 14n dcacam and 15n labeled n dbps 15n dcan and 15n dcacam were formed using 15n labeled nh2cl the 14n percentages in the n dbps are shown in fig s2 without clo2 pre oxidation the dcan and dcacam molar yields were 0 29 0 84 and 0 20 0 94 respectively after chloramination of seven amino acids and peptides and six indoles and tertiary amines of all 20 compounds the three hydroxybenzamide compounds gave the highest dcan molar yields during chloramination 1 and four tetracycline antibiotics gave the highest dcacam yields 14 fig 2 excluding dcan formation from dmabn and tc and dcacam formation from 3 hba 2 hba and four tetracycline antibiotics the 14n percentages in the dcan and dcacam produced were 50 fig s2 similar results have previously been found for amino acids yang et al 2012 this suggested that nh2cl supplied most of the nitrogen in dcan formed from the compounds other than dmabn and tc and in dcacam formed from the compounds other than 3 hba 2 hba and four tetracycline antibiotics after chloramination of the four tetracyclines the dcacam molar yields were 14 79 28 32 which were much higher than the dcan yields 0 4 fig 2 14n dcan contributed 50 of the total dcan yields except for the yield from tc but 14n dcacam contributed 90 of the total amounts of dcacam produced when the four tetracycline antibiotics were chloraminated fig s2 this indicated that the tetracyclines were the main sources of nitrogen in dcacam but that the tetracyclines and nh2cl both supplied the nitrogen in dcan these results suggested that dcacam is not necessarily a product of dcan during chloramination of tetracyclines as shown in fig 2 clo2 pre oxidation affected the dcan and dcacam yields differently for the chloramination of the 20 different nitrogenous compounds clo2 pre oxidation increased the amounts of unlabeled and 15n labeled n dbps that formed from the chloramination of six amino acids and peptides excluding tyr ala and five indoles and tertiary amines excluding dmbza this agreed with the increase in n dbp yields from tyr caused by clo2 pre oxidation in a previous study yao et al 2018 this suggested that the clo2 pre oxidation products of these compounds were more reactive than the parent compounds in terms of supplying nitrogen and combining with nitrogen in nh2cl to allow dcan and dcacam to form which will be discussed further in the sections below clo2 pre oxidation increased the 14n percentages in the dcan formed form most of the compounds fig s2 suggesting that clo2 pre oxidation increased 14n dcan formation more effectively than increasing 15n dcan formation during chloramination however clo2 pre oxidation significantly decreased the dcan and dcacam yields from the chloramination of dmbza clo2 pre oxidation decreased the dcan yields from the chloramination of the hydroxybenzamide compounds by 12 76 but increased the dcacam yields by 35 236 furthermore the 14n percentage was higher for dcacam than dcan formed through the chloramination of the hydroxybenzamide compounds with and without clo2 pre oxidation fig s1 these results indicated that the hydroxybenzamide compounds and some intermediates formed during clo2 oxidation may form dcacam without forming dcan during chloramination during chloramination of the three hydroxybenzamides n dbp formation from 2 hba was most strongly affected by clo2 pre oxidation while n dbp formation from 4 hba was only slightly affected by clo2 pre oxidation the different degrees to which clo2 pre oxidation affected n dbp formation from 4 hba and 2 hba during chloramination will be discussed further based on the identities of the intermediates in the sections below clo2 pre oxidation affected dcan and dcacam formation during the chloramination of tetracycline antibiotics in exactly the opposite ways to how it affected dcan and dcacam formation during the chloramination of the hydroxybenzamide compounds mentioned above clo2 pre oxidation markedly decreased the dcacam particularly 14n dcacam yields from chloramination of the four tetracyclines so clo2 oxidation decreased the 14n percentages in the total dcacam fig s2 however clo2 oxidation increased both the 14n dcan and 15n dcan yields this indicated that the intermediates formed through reactions with clo2 were less reactive than the tetracyclines in terms of supplying nitrogen for dcacam formation but were more reactive in terms of supplying nitrogen for dcan formation in combination with nitrogen in nh2cl it has previously been found that clo2 readily reacts with unprotonated dimethylamino groups and phenolic diketone groups in tetracyclines causing ring breakage wang et al 2011 however more research is required to determined how the clo2 oxidation products inhibit dcacam formation but not dcan formation during chloramination 3 1 2 dbp formation from non nitrogenous compounds the effects of clo2 pre oxidation on the dcan and dcacam yields during the chloramination of seven phenolic compounds are shown in table 1 without clo2 pre oxidation phenol and resorcinol showed the highest dcan yields 3 46 and 3 42 respectively during chloramination but resorcinol and 1 3 5 trihydroxybenzene exhibited the highest dcacam yields 18 23 and 19 32 respectively the dcan and or dcacam yields from the phenolic compounds table 1 were higher than from most of the nitrogenous precursors fig 2 suggesting that these phenolic compounds could be important precursors of dcan and or dcacam using nitrogen from nh2cl the dcacam yield was lower than the dcan yield during the chloramination of phenol consistent with the results of previous studies le roux et al 2016 nihemaiti et al 2017 however resorcinol 1 3 5 trihydroxybenzene catechol 1 2 3 trihydroxybenzene and 1 2 4 trihydroxybenzene had much higher dcacam yields than dcan yields during chloramination suggesting that these phenolic compounds may form dcacam through a pathway not involving dcan hydrolysis clo2 pretreatment significantly decreased the dcan yields from the chloramination of phenol resorcinol and 1 3 5 trihydroxybenzene by 61 87 and 51 respectively clo2 pretreatment decreased the dcacam yields during the chloramination of resorcinol and phenol by 82 and 37 respectively but increased the dcacam yield during the chloramination of 1 3 5 trihydroxybenzene by 37 clo2 pre oxidation only slightly changed the dcan and dcacam yields during the chloramination of the other four phenolic compounds it has previously been found that clo2 transforms to free chlorine when reacting with phenols rougé et al 2018 terhalle et al 2018 and the amounts of dcacam formed from the chloramination of phenols with pre chlorination are more than those without pre chlorination chuang et al 2015 therefore the in situ formed free chlorine in clo2 applications may increase the dcacam yields during the chloramination of the phenolic compounds however clo2 pre oxidation generally decreased the amounts of dcan and dcacam formed from the chloramination of the phenolic compounds this emphatically suggested that the reaction between clo2 and phenols caused a decrease of dcacam yield from the chloramination of the phenols and clo2 rather than hocl played a dominant role on changing dcacam formation during post chloramination which will be discussed later through reaction pathways 3 1 3 effects of clo2 dose and pre oxidation time as mentioned above clo2 pre oxidation caused four different types of changes in dcan and dcacam formation during the chloramination of indoles hydroxybenzamides tetracyclines and phenolic compounds we therefore performed experiments using 3 min 2 hba tc and resorcinol to investigate the effects of the clo2 dose and pre oxidation time on dcan and dcacam formation during chloramination the results are shown in figs 3 s3 and s4 the clo2 dose markedly affected dcan and dcacam formation during the subsequent chloramination process fig 3 however at a relatively low clo2 dose at clo2 precursor molar ratios of 10 for tc and 2 5 for the other compounds the clo2 pre oxidation time little affected the amounts of dcan and dcacam formed and the sources of nitrogen during chloramination figs s3 and s4 as shown in fig 3 a increasing the clo2 dose from 0 1 to 0 5 mm caused the unlabeled and 15n labeled dcan and dcacam yields during the subsequent chloramination of 3 min to increase gradually but increasing the clo2 dose further to 1 mm caused the dcan and dcacam yields to start to decrease this suggested that clo2 reacted with 3 min to form reactive intermediates that could form more dcan and dcacam but that excess clo2 might transform the intermediates further and therefore decrease the abilities of the intermediates to form dcan and dcacam clo2 pre oxidation increased the 14n percentage in the dcan formed from 3 min fig s4 indicating that clo2 pre oxidation increased 14n dcan formation more effectively than increasing 15n dcan formation during the chloramination of 3 min increasing the clo2 dose from 0 to 0 5 mm or increasing the pre oxidation time from 0 to 60 min caused the 14n dcacam yield during the subsequent chloramination of 2 hba to increase gradually but little affected the 15n dcacam yield figs 3 and s3 therefore gradually increased the 14n percentage for the dcacam that formed fig s4 this suggested that increasing the clo2 dose increased the amounts of nitrogenous intermediates that were formed through clo2 oxidation and that could supply nitrogen to dcacam formed during subsequent chloramination it also suggested that the intermediates were as reactive as 2 hba in terms of combining with nh2cl nitrogen to produce dcacam the 14n dcan and 15n dcan yields for the chloramination of 2 hba with clo2 pre oxidation decreased and then reached a plateau as the clo2 dose increased but the 14n percentage in the dcan that was formed during chloramination was not affected by clo2 pre oxidation fig s4 this suggested that clo2 pre oxidation decreased the amounts of 14n dcan and 15n dcan formed during the chloramination of 2 hba to similar degrees increasing the clo2 pre oxidation dose gradually decreased the 14n dcacam yield but first increased and then decreased the 15n dcacam yield when tc was chloraminated 14n dcacam was always the dominant product when tc was chloraminated after clo2 pre oxidation but the 14n dcacam contribution to the total dcacam yield decreased as the clo2 dose increased fig s4 this indicated that the clo2 pre oxidation products were less reactive than tc in terms of supplying nitrogen for the production of dcacam but were more reactive than tc in terms of combining with nh2cl nitrogen to produce dcacam the 14n percentage in the dcacam was always 50 and was higher than the 14n percentage in the dcan formed through the chloramination of 2 hba and tc under different clo2 pre oxidation conditions fig s4 this again suggested that nitrogen containing transformation products of 2 hba and tc formed during clo2 oxidation may supply nitrogen to directly produce dcacam during chloramination rather than dcacam forming through the hydrolysis of dcan clo2 pre oxidation decreased the amounts of dcan and dcacam formed from resorcinol combining with nh2cl nitrogen during chloramination increasing the clo2 dose decreased the amounts of dcan and dcacam that formed the results from these four compounds confirmed that clo2 pre oxidation affected dcan and dcacam formation during chloramination in different ways 3 2 pathways for dbp formation after clo2 pre oxidation 3 2 1 pathways for dbp formation from 3 min and trp a solution containing 3 min 0 1 mm was pre oxidized with clo2 0 25 mm at ph 7 0 and the intermediates formed were identified to investigate how clo2 pre oxidation increased the amounts of dcan and dcacam formed during the chloramination of indoles the gc ms total ion chromatogram contained several peaks for 3 min labeled p131 at retention time rt 17 5 min product p135 at rt 15 9 min product p161 at rt 16 8 min and product p163 at rt 19 2 min fig s5 the areas of the peaks for the three products changed but no new products were observed as the clo2 dose increased the molecular formulae and structures proposed for the three products using the nist database are shown in table 2 product p163 was dominant and had a higher peak area than 3 min and the other two products fig s5 the odd numbered nominal mass 163 da suggested that p163 contained an odd number of nitrogen atoms losses of 28 da between m z 163 and 135 and between m z 120 and 92 indicated that p163 contained two c o groups fig s6 we therefore propose p163 was n 2 acetylphenyl formamide the other products were identified using a similar method p161 contained an odd number of nitrogen atoms it had an odd numbered nominal mass of 161 da and two c o groups it lost 28 da between m z 146 and 118 and between m z 118 and 90 so we proposed that p161 was 2 acetylphenyl isocyanate fig s6 we concluded that p135 was 2 aminoacetophenone and verified this by analyzing a standard products p163 p161 and p135 are structurally similar to n formylkynurenine the isocyanate product and kynurenine shown in table s6 respectively which are the intermediates previously found in the reaction between clo2 and trp an amino acid containing an indole structure stewart et al 2008 casbeer et al 2013 based on the intermediates identified in this study and reported in previous studies we proposed the pathways for dcan and dcacam formation during chloramination of 3 min and trp after clo2 pre oxidation shown in fig 4 a clo2 reacts with 3 min or trp to form a highly reactive radical cation species and chlorite through an electron transfer reaction stewart et al 2008 the indole ring in the radical cation species then loses a proton to form the corresponding radical that further reacts with clo2 to form a 3 min oclo or trp oclo adduct stewart et al 2008 navalon et al 2009 the adduct is transformed into a stable product n 2 acetylphenyl formamide p163 or n formylkynurenine stewart et al 2008 and then oxidized by hocl hydrolyzed and decarboxylated to form the stable product 2 aminoecetophenone p135 or kynurenine tanaka et al 1976 casbeer et al 2013 therefore the stable intermediate products may lead to dcan and dcacam formation during subsequent chloramination the roles of the intermediates formed from clo2 oxidation of 3 min and trp in dcan and dcacam formation during chloramination were investigated by performing more dbp formation experiments using 2 aminoacetophenone and kynurenine which were the only intermediates for which standards were available as shown in fig s7 the 14n dcan and 15n dcan yields from 2 aminoacetophenone were about 3 9 and 1 7 times higher respectively than those from 3 min under the same chloramination conditions similar results were found for 14n dcacam and 15n dcacam therefore 2 aminoacetophenone formed during clo2 oxidation of 3 min may contribute to the increases in the amounts of dcan and dcacam formed from 3 min chloramination caused by clo2 pre oxidation however kynurenine exhibited lower dcan and dcacam yields than trp under the same chloramination conditions fig s7 therefore the increases in the amounts of dcan and dcacam formed from trp during chloramination after clo2 pre oxidation may have been caused by the other intermediates which needs further research 3 2 2 pathways for dbp formation from 2 hba clo2 pre oxidation of the three hydroxybenzamide compounds decreased the dcan yields but increased the dcacam yields during chloramination dcan and dcacam formation from 2 hba was most strongly affected so experiments using 2 hba were performed to further evaluate the pathways for dcan and dcacam formation during chloramination with and without clo2 pre oxidation three products were identified as the intermediates of the reaction between 2 hba 0 1 mm and nh2cl 1 mm without clo2 pre oxidation by gc ms and they were 5 chlorosalicylamide p171 3 chloro 2 hydroxy benzamide p171 and 3 5 dichloro 2 hydroxy benzamide p205 table s6 the electron impact ionization mass spectra of the products are shown in fig s8 from the products that were identified we proposed a possible pathway for dcan and dcacam formation through the reaction between 2 hba and nh2cl fig 4b chlorine substitution on the benzene ring will primarily occur at the positions para and ortho to the hydroxyl group during chloramination heasley et al 2004 so monochlorinated intermediates such as 5 chlorosalicylamide and 3 chloro 2 hydroxy benzamide are primarily formed during chloramination of 2 hba the monochlorinated product then reacts with nh2cl to form a dichlorinated product heasley et al 2004 which is 3 5 dichloro 2 hydroxy benzamide for 2 hba chloramination after a series of electrophilic substitutions decarboxylation and ring opening 3 5 dichloro 2 hydroxy benzamide will be converted into dcan and dcacam chuang et al 2015 nihemaiti et al 2016 the key intermediates in the reaction between 2 hba 0 1 mm and clo2 0 25 mm were identified by lc qtof ms in negative electrospray ionization mode product p169 rt 2 56 min was the dominant product found in the lc qtof ms spectrum table 2 and fig s9 p169 had a m z ratio of 168 0297 corresponding to a molecular formula of c7h7no4 which has two more oxygen atoms than 2 hba c7h7no2 a loss of 18 da was found between m z 168 and 150 indicating the loss of an oh h group p169 was therefore tentatively identified as formamid trans muconic acid this is structurally similar to monomethyl trans muconic acid which was found to be a product of 2 methoxyphenol and clo2 as shown in table s6 larson et al 1994 it has previously been found that the phenolate forms of phenolic compounds are the reactive species when clo2 oxidation is performed hoigné and bader 1994 the initial step in the oxidation of phenolic compounds by clo2 involves a one electron transfer from a phenolate hydroxyl group to generate a phenoxy radical with a series of resonance structures ni et al 1994 for 2 hba the phenoxy radical has a resonance structure with an unpaired electron on the amide substituted carbon atom the resonance structure can be attacked by clo2 to give an oclo adduct hydrolysis of which may lead to the formation of p169 we therefore proposed the pathways for reactions between 2 hba and clo2 shown in fig 4b during subsequent chloramination p169 probably undergoes chlorine substitution and hofmann rearrangement reactions to give a derivative of trans muconic acid yu and reckhow 2017 tanaka et al 1976 ding et al 2018 the derivative of trans muconic acid contains an amide group this amide group may be involved in the direct formation of 14n dcacam without a dcan intermediate during chloramination ding et al 2018 unfortunately no commercial standards for the proposed intermediates were available to allow dbp formation tests to be performed so it remains unclear whether these intermediates accounted for the increase in dcacam formation and decrease in dcan formation during the chloramination of 2 hba caused by clo2 pre oxidation three intermediates of the reaction between 4 hba 0 1 mm and clo2 0 25 mm were identified by gc ms the intermediates were 1 4 benzoquinone p108 hydroquinone p110 and chlorohydroquinone p144 table s7 and fig s10 1 4 benzoquinone has previously been found to be a product of the clo2 oxidation of 4 methoxyphenol and 4 carboxyphenol gan et al 2019 the dcan yields from the chloramination of 1 4 benzoquinone and hydroquinone were 0 89 and 0 92 respectively table 1 which were comparable to the dcan yield from the chloramination of 4 hba 1 03 the transformation of 4 hba into benzoquinone and hydroquinone after clo2 pre oxidation may therefore partly account for the slight decrease in dcan formation during chloramination when clo2 pre oxidation was performed 3 2 3 pathways for dbp formation from phenolic compounds pathways for reactions between resorcinol and clo2 or nh2cl have been proposed previously lin et al 1984 gan et al 2019 heasley et al 1999 nihemaiti et al 2016 the effects of clo2 pre oxidation on the dcan and dcacam formation pathways during chloramination of phenolic compounds therefore using resorcinol as an example are shown in fig 4c compounds i iii are previously identified intermediates in the reaction between resorcinol and nh2cl nihemaiti et al 2016 chloramination of resorcinol leads to the formation of a pentachlororesorcinol intermediate compound i which undergoes nitrogen attack from nh2cl ring cleavage and intramolecular nucleophilic substitution reactions to form a nitrogenous heterocyclic compound compound ii and finally to form n dbps illustrated as pathway 1 in fig 4c nihemaiti et al 2016 2 2 4 trichloro 1 3 cyclopentenedione compound iii is also formed from the pentachlororesorcinol intermediate through a series of reactions including oxygen attack from h2o and decarboxylation nihemaiti et al 2016 it has been found in many studies that unsaturated ketones including chloro trihydroxycyclohexadienones compound iv and 2 2 dichlorocyclopent 4 ene 1 3 dione compound ⅴ are frequently detected after clo2 oxidation of resorcinol lin et al 1984 jackson et al 1987 gan et al 2019 as shown in pathway 3 in fig 4c clo2 transforms resorcinol into five membered diketones e g compound ⅴ or its derivatives through electron transfer oxidation and decarboxylation reactions lin et al 1984 gan et al 2019 unfortunately no commercial standards for the five membered diketones were available for dbp formation tests and it is unclear whether the transformation from resorcinol into the five membered diketones by clo2 oxidation contributes to the decrease in the amounts of dcan and dcacam formed from resorcinol chloramination caused by clo2 pre oxidation clo2 pre oxidation generally decreased the amounts of dcan and dcacam formed from phenolic compounds particularly resorcinol and phenol during chloramination it has previously been found that 1 4 benzoquinone is a transformation product of clo2 oxidation of phenol and hydroquinone wajon et al 1982 ganiev et al 2003 wenk et al 2013 as shown in table 1 the dcan and dcacam yields from the chloramination of 1 4 benzoquinone were 0 89 and 0 34 respectively and were lower than those of phenol and hydroquinone after clo2 pre oxidation the transformation of phenol and hydroquinone into 1 4 benzoquinone therefore may decrease the dcan and dcacam yields during chloramination 3 3 effects of clo2 pre oxidation on the formation and nitrogen origins of dcan and dcacam from water samples dcan and dcacam formation in real water samples and the sources of nitrogen in the dcan and dcacam formed during chloramination with and without clo2 pre oxidation were also investigated figs 5 and s11 the water samples contain bromide and therefore dcan and dcacam only represent a fraction of the dihaloacetonitriles acetamides without clo2 pretreatment the dcan and dcacam concentrations were 1 40 4 41 and 4 03 10 42 μg l respectively fig 5 the 14n percentages in the dcan and dcacam produced were 23 30 and 22 39 respectively indicating that nitrogen used to form dcan and dcacam in the water samples was mostly supplied by nh2cl fig s11 which agreed with the results of previous studies huang et al 2012 le roux et al 2016 with the possible exception of dcacam formation in surface water samples s1 and s5 clo2 pre oxidation decreased the unlabeled and 15n labeled dcan and dcacam yields during the chloramination of all water samples and the decreases increased in magnitude as the clo2 dose increased fig 5 for example clo2 pre oxidation using the highest clo2 dose 1 5 doc concentration decreased the total dcan 14n dcan and 15n dcan yields by 49 70 31 52 and 55 76 respectively clo2 pre oxidation of samples s1 and s5 decreased the 14n dcacam yield but increased the 15n dcacam yield and the total dcacam yield in sample s5 was slightly increased by clo2 pre treatment clo2 pre oxidation decreased the dcacam yields less as percentages than the dcan yields during chloramination of all water samples suggesting that clo2 pre oxidation removed dcan precursors more effectively than dcacam precursors from the water samples it is interesting that clo2 pre oxidation decreased the 15n dcan yield more than the 14n dcan yield for every water sample and therefore increased the contribution of 14n dcan to the total dcan concentration but had the opposite effect for dcacam fig s11 this suggested that clo2 mainly breaks the dominant dcan formation pathway through which nitrogen in dcan is supplied by nh2cl but mainly breaks the dcacam formation pathway through which nitrogen in dcacam is supplied by organic precursors the results of our model compound study above indicated that the phenolic compounds that account for 21 of the total carbon in humic substances norwood et al 1987 gave relatively high dcan and dcacam yields during chloramination table 1 suggesting that phenolic compounds are important dcan and dcacam precursors clo2 pre oxidation generally decreased the amounts of dcan and dcacam formed during the chloramination of phenolic compounds the decreases in 15n labeled dcan and dcacam yields during the chloramination of water samples caused by clo2 oxidation may therefore have been caused by phenolic precursors in the water samples being destroyed by oxidation by clo2 clo2 pre oxidation also decreased the amounts of 14n dcan and 14n dcacam formed during chloramination of the water samples but increased the amounts formed during chloramination of the amino acids that we used free amino acids typically make small contributions to total dissolved organic nitrogen concentrations in water samples and macromolecular proteins are usually the dominant contributors of dissolved organic nitrogen westerhoff and mash 2002 we therefore performed experiments using bsa to investigate the effects of clo2 pre oxidation on dbp formation the results are shown in table s8 unlabeled and 15n labeled n dbp formation was suppressed by clo2 pre oxidation clo2 pre oxidation decreased the 14n dcan and 14n dcacam yields during the chloramination of bsa by 11 20 and 14 22 respectively this was consistent with the results for the water samples it has previously been found that clo2 can modify many tyr residue sites in bsa to form different peptides and that clo2 oxidation of some peptides containing tyr residues gives different products from the products of clo2 oxidation of free tyr ogata 2007 unlike for tyr clo2 pre oxidation of tyr ala decreased the dcan yield during chloramination fig 2 we therefore speculate that reactions between clo2 and macromolecular proteins in water samples may decrease the dcan and dcacam particularly 14n dcan and 14n dcacam yields during chloramination after clo2 oxidation furthermore clo2 oxidation decreased the dcan yields during the chloramination of hydroxybenzamide compounds and decreased the dcacam yields during the chloramination of tetracyclines unfortunately these two groups of model compounds were not quantified in the water samples and it is unclear whether these compounds are precursors that could contribute to the mitigation of n dbp production caused by pre treating water with clo2 4 conclusions the effects of clo2 pre oxidation on dcan and dcacam formation and the sources of nitrogen in the dcan and dcacam formed during chloramination of 28 model compounds and seven real water samples were investigated clo2 pre oxidation caused four different types of changes in the dcan and dcacam yields during chloramination of the model compounds clo2 pre oxidation increased the dcan and dcacam yields during the chloramination of six amino acids and peptides and five indoles and tertiary amines through pathways involving both organic matter and monochloramine as nitrogen sources clo2 pre oxidation of three hydroxybenzamide compounds inhibited dcan formation but promoted dcacam formation during chloramination however clo2 pre oxidation increased the dcan yields but significantly decreased the dcacam particularly 14n dcacam yields during chloramination of tetracycline antibiotics clo2 pre oxidation generally decreased the amounts of dcan and dcacam formed through phenolic compounds particularly resorcinol and phenol combining with nh2cl nitrogen during chloramination the different effects of clo2 pre oxidation on dcan and dcacam formation became clearer as the clo2 dose increased pathways for dcan and dcacam formation during chloramination of 3 min trp 2 hba and resorcinol after clo2 pre oxidation were proposed based on intermediates that were identified 2 aminoacetophenone which was found to be a product of clo2 oxidation of 3 min may contribute to the increases in dcan and dcacam yields during 3 min chloramination caused by clo2 pre oxidation similarly transformation of phenol and hydroquinone into 1 4 benzoquinone may decrease the dcan and dcacam yields during chloramination clo2 pre oxidation generally decreased the dcan and dcacam yields by 36 70 and 11 59 respectively during chloramination of the water samples furthermore clo2 pre oxidation of the water samples increased the contribution of 14n dcan to the total dcan concentration but decreased the contribution of 14n dcacam to the total dcacam concentration the decreases in dcan and dcacam yields during chloramination of water samples caused by clo2 oxidation may be caused by clo2 oxidation destroying phenolic precursors and

17515,chlorine dioxide clo2 can be used as a pre oxidant when chloramination is performed in water treatment plants however the effects of clo2 pre oxidation on the formation of nitrogenous disinfection by products such as dichloroacetonitrile dcan and dichloroacetamide dcacam during chloramination are not well understood in this study the effects of clo2 pre oxidation on the formation of dcan and dcacam during chloramination of 28 model compounds and seven real water samples were investigated the sources of nitrogen for dcan and dcacam formation were investigated using 15n labeled monochloramine clo2 pre oxidation affected dcan and dcacam formation during chloramination of model compounds in different ways clo2 pre oxidation increased unlabeled and 15n labeled dcan and dcacam formation during chloramination of six amino acids and peptides and five indoles and tertiary amines clo2 pre oxidation decreased dcan formation but increased dcacam formation during chloramination of three hydroxybenzamide compounds but had the opposite effects for four tetracyclines clo2 pre oxidation generally decreased dcan and dcacam formation during chloramination of the phenolic compounds that are precursors not containing nitrogen 2 aminoacetophenone formamid trans muconic acid and unsaturated ketones were found to be transformation products of clo2 oxidation of 3 methylindole salicylamide and resorcinol respectively possible dcan and dcacam formation pathways during chloramination after clo2 oxidation were identified for most of the water samples clo2 pre oxidation decreased the amounts of dcan and dcacam formed during chloramination by 36 70 and 11 59 respectively this may have been caused by clo2 oxidation destroying phenolic precursors and macromolecular

chlorate upon its reaction with water constituents chlorite is generally the primary product and is regulated by u s epa and other regulatory agencies worldwide however chlorite can inhibit nitrification in a chloraminated distribution system mcguire et al 2006 2009 rahman et al 2011 therefore the use of clo2 in combination with post chloramination may avoid the occurrence of

and thus alter their dbp formation potential during chloramination hoigné and bader 1994 yang et al 2013 clo2 pre oxidation has been found to decrease the formation of haas nitrosamines and dcan during chloramination of surface water yang et al 2013 lee et al 2007 but to increase dcan formation during chloramination of tyrosine based amino acids yao et al 2018 however little information is available on the effects of clo2 pre oxidation on dcacam formation during chloramination although dcan hydrolysis forms dcacam dcacam can be formed via pathways that do not involve dcan hydrolysis huang et al 2012 it remains unclear whether clo2 pre oxidation affects dcacam formation during chloramination in similar ways to how it affects dcan formation as such the goal of this study was to investigate the effects of clo2 pre oxidation on dcan and dcacam formation during chloramination 28 model precursors including 20 nitrogenous organic compounds and eight non nitrogenous organic compounds fig 1 and seven real water samples from different sources were used the yields of dcan and dcacam during chloramination of the model compounds and real water samples with and without clo2 pre oxidation were compared nitrogenous organics and nh2cl that supplied nitrogen to form dcan and dcacam were identified using 15n nh2cl and the intermediates were determined to allow the pathways for dcan and dcacam formation during chloramination with and without clo2 pre oxidation to be proposed 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and solutions accustandard dcan 98 was supplied by sigma

the model compounds are shown in table s1 stock solutions of the model compounds in ultrapure water or methanol depending on the solubility of each compound were prepared the presence of methanol caused negligible amounts of dcan and dcacam to form with or without clo2 pre oxidation table s2 nh2cl and 15n labeled nh2cl stock solutions were prepared daily by adding sodium hypochlorite to ammonium chloride and 15n labeled ammonium chloride 98 sigma aldrich solutions at a ratio of 0 8 mol mol respectively huang et al 2012 the concentrations of nh2cl and dichloramine nhcl2 in stock nh2cl solutions were quantified by monitoring absorbances at 245 and 295 nm and solving simultaneous equations schreiber and mitch 2005 and nhcl2 concentrations were negligible a clo2 solution was prepared from gaseous clo2 by slowly adding dilute h2so4 to a sodium chlorite solution following a standard method apha 1998 the clo2 concentration was determined using a hach dr2800 portable photometer hash loveland co usa by the diethyl p phenylene diamine colorimetric method apha 1998 2 2 water samples surface water samples labeled s1 s5 were collected from the influents of five drinking water utilities and wastewater effluent samples labeled w1 and w2 were collected from the effluents of two wastewater treatment plants in guangdong province china each sample was passed through a 0 45 µm membrane filter to remove particles and stored at 4 c until it was used the characteristics of the water samples are shown in table s3 2 3 experimental procedures each experiment was conducted under headspace free conditions in a 60 ml amber glass bottle shielded from light at room temperature 25 0 0 5 c each sample was buffered to ph 7 0 with 10 mm phosphate buffer a solution containing the selected model compound 0 1 mm except for the tetracycline antibiotics or real water sample was pre oxidized by clo2 at the specified dose for 30 min the dose of clo2 was 2 5 clo2 precursor molar ratio for model compounds except for the tetracycline antibiotics and the doses of clo2 were 0 5 1 5 clo2 dissolved organic carbon doc mass ratio for water samples after 30 min oxidation time the residual clo2 concentration was determined table s4 before the clo2 was completely removed by bubbling nitrogen through the solution gan et al 2019 the concentrations of dcan and dcacam formed after clo2 pre oxidation of the model compounds or water samples were negligible compared with those formed during chloramination table s5 zhong et al 2019 nh2cl or 15n labeled nh2cl was then added to a model compound solution to give a nh2cl precursor molar ratio of 10 or to a water sample at a dose of 3 doc mg c l 5 no2 n mg n l following a method previously described by hu et al 2010 after 72 h chloramination time except for the tetracycline antibiotics the residual chloramine was quenched by adding a stoichiometric amount of ascorbic acid then the samples were extracted immediately for dbp analysis the tetracycline antibiotics were found to consume clo2 and nh2cl much faster than other model compounds and produced a very large amount of dcacam during chloramination from preliminary experiments so the concentration of tetracycline antibiotic in the solution was reduced to 0 05 mm the doses of clo2 increased to 10 clo2 precursor molar ratio for pre oxidation and the chloramination time was shortened to 24 h the effects of clo2 pre oxidation on dcan and dcacam formation during chloramination of tetracycline antibiotics were consistent when the experimental conditions were changed fig s1 3 methylindole 3 min salicylamide 2 hba and 4 hydroxybenzamide 4 hba were used to investigate the intermediates formed during clo2 oxidation and chloramination a solution containing 3 min 2 hba or 4 hba 0 1 mm was dosed with clo2 at the desired concentration 0 25 mm and incubated at ph 7 0 for 2 h the solution was then extracted with mtbe and the extract was analyzed by gas

the ammonia nitrate and nitrite concentrations were determined using hanna hi96700 hi96728 and hi96707 portable photometers hanna instruments respectively the analytical methods of n dbps and the intermediates are described in detail in text s1 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of clo2 pre oxidation on the formation and nitrogen origins of dcan and dcacam from model compounds 3 1 1 dbp formation from nitrogenous compounds and the origins of nitrogen in the dbps fig 2 shows the formation of dcan and dcacam during chloramination of the 20 nitrogenous compounds with and without clo2 pre oxidation unlabeled n dbps 14n dcan and 14n dcacam and 15n labeled n dbps 15n dcan and 15n dcacam were formed using 15n labeled nh2cl the 14n percentages in the n dbps are shown in fig s2 without clo2 pre oxidation the dcan and dcacam molar yields were 0 29 0 84 and 0 20 0 94 respectively after chloramination of seven amino acids and peptides and six indoles and tertiary amines of all 20 compounds the three hydroxybenzamide compounds gave the highest dcan molar yields during chloramination 1 and four tetracycline antibiotics gave the highest dcacam yields 14 fig 2 excluding dcan formation from dmabn and tc and dcacam formation from 3 hba 2 hba and four tetracycline antibiotics the 14n percentages in the dcan and dcacam produced were 50 fig s2 similar results have previously been found for amino acids yang et al 2012 this suggested that nh2cl supplied most of the nitrogen in dcan formed from the compounds other than dmabn and tc and in dcacam formed from the compounds other than 3 hba 2 hba and four tetracycline antibiotics after chloramination of the four tetracyclines the dcacam molar yields were 14 79 28 32 which were much higher than the dcan yields 0 4 fig 2 14n dcan contributed 50 of the total dcan yields except for the yield from tc but 14n dcacam contributed 90 of the total amounts of dcacam produced when the four tetracycline antibiotics were chloraminated fig s2 this indicated that the tetracyclines were the main sources of nitrogen in dcacam but that the tetracyclines and nh2cl both supplied the nitrogen in dcan these results suggested that dcacam is not necessarily a product of dcan during chloramination of tetracyclines as shown in fig 2 clo2 pre oxidation affected the dcan and dcacam yields differently for the chloramination of the 20 different nitrogenous compounds clo2 pre oxidation increased the amounts of unlabeled and 15n labeled n dbps that formed from the chloramination of six amino acids and peptides excluding tyr ala and five indoles and tertiary amines excluding dmbza this agreed with the increase in n dbp yields from tyr caused by clo2 pre oxidation in a previous study yao et al 2018 this suggested that the clo2 pre oxidation products of these compounds were more reactive than the parent compounds in terms of supplying nitrogen and combining with nitrogen in nh2cl to allow dcan and dcacam to form which will be discussed further in the sections below clo2 pre oxidation increased the 14n percentages in the dcan formed form most of the compounds fig s2 suggesting that clo2 pre oxidation increased 14n dcan formation more effectively than increasing 15n dcan formation during chloramination however clo2 pre oxidation significantly decreased the dcan and dcacam yields from the chloramination of dmbza clo2 pre oxidation decreased the dcan yields from the chloramination of the hydroxybenzamide compounds by 12 76 but increased the dcacam yields by 35 236 furthermore the 14n percentage was higher for dcacam than dcan formed through the chloramination of the hydroxybenzamide compounds with and without clo2 pre oxidation fig s1 these results indicated that the hydroxybenzamide compounds and some intermediates formed during clo2 oxidation may form dcacam without forming dcan during chloramination during chloramination of the three hydroxybenzamides n dbp formation from 2 hba was most strongly affected by clo2 pre oxidation while n dbp formation from 4 hba was only slightly affected by clo2 pre oxidation the different degrees to which clo2 pre oxidation affected n dbp formation from 4 hba and 2 hba during chloramination will be discussed further based on the identities of the intermediates in the sections below clo2 pre oxidation affected dcan and dcacam formation during the chloramination of tetracycline antibiotics in exactly the opposite ways to how it affected dcan and dcacam formation during the chloramination of the hydroxybenzamide compounds mentioned above clo2 pre oxidation markedly decreased the dcacam particularly 14n dcacam yields from chloramination of the four tetracyclines so clo2 oxidation decreased the 14n percentages in the total dcacam fig s2 however clo2 oxidation increased both the 14n dcan and 15n dcan yields this indicated that the intermediates formed through reactions with clo2 were less reactive than the tetracyclines in terms of supplying nitrogen for dcacam formation but were more reactive in terms of supplying nitrogen for dcan formation in combination with nitrogen in nh2cl it has previously been found that clo2 readily reacts with unprotonated dimethylamino groups and phenolic diketone groups in tetracyclines causing ring breakage wang et al 2011 however more research is required to determined how the clo2 oxidation products inhibit dcacam formation but not dcan formation during chloramination 3 1 2 dbp formation from non nitrogenous compounds the effects of clo2 pre oxidation on the dcan and dcacam yields during the chloramination of seven phenolic compounds are shown in table 1 without clo2 pre oxidation phenol and resorcinol showed the highest dcan yields 3 46 and 3 42 respectively during chloramination but resorcinol and 1 3 5 trihydroxybenzene exhibited the highest dcacam yields 18 23 and 19 32 respectively the dcan and or dcacam yields from the phenolic compounds table 1 were higher than from most of the nitrogenous precursors fig 2 suggesting that these phenolic compounds could be important precursors of dcan and or dcacam using nitrogen from nh2cl the dcacam yield was lower than the dcan yield during the chloramination of phenol consistent with the results of previous studies le roux et al 2016 nihemaiti et al 2017 however resorcinol 1 3 5 trihydroxybenzene catechol 1 2 3 trihydroxybenzene and 1 2 4 trihydroxybenzene had much higher dcacam yields than dcan yields during chloramination suggesting that these phenolic compounds may form dcacam through a pathway not involving dcan hydrolysis clo2 pretreatment significantly decreased the dcan yields from the chloramination of phenol resorcinol and 1 3 5 trihydroxybenzene by 61 87 and 51 respectively clo2 pretreatment decreased the dcacam yields during the chloramination of resorcinol and phenol by 82 and 37 respectively but increased the dcacam yield during the chloramination of 1 3 5 trihydroxybenzene by 37 clo2 pre oxidation only slightly changed the dcan and dcacam yields during the chloramination of the other four phenolic compounds it has previously been found that clo2 transforms to free chlorine when reacting with phenols rougé et al 2018 terhalle et al 2018 and the amounts of dcacam formed from the chloramination of phenols with pre chlorination are more than those without pre chlorination chuang et al 2015 therefore the in situ formed free chlorine in clo2 applications may increase the dcacam yields during the chloramination of the phenolic compounds however clo2 pre oxidation generally decreased the amounts of dcan and dcacam formed from the chloramination of the phenolic compounds this emphatically suggested that the reaction between clo2 and phenols caused a decrease of dcacam yield from the chloramination of the phenols and clo2 rather than hocl played a dominant role on changing dcacam formation during post chloramination which will be discussed later through reaction pathways 3 1 3 effects of clo2 dose and pre oxidation time as mentioned above clo2 pre oxidation caused four different types of changes in dcan and dcacam formation during the chloramination of indoles hydroxybenzamides tetracyclines and phenolic compounds we therefore performed experiments using 3 min 2 hba tc and resorcinol to investigate the effects of the clo2 dose and pre oxidation time on dcan and dcacam formation during chloramination the results are shown in figs 3 s3 and s4 the clo2 dose markedly affected dcan and dcacam formation during the subsequent chloramination process fig 3 however at a relatively low clo2 dose at clo2 precursor molar ratios of 10 for tc and 2 5 for the other compounds the clo2 pre oxidation time little affected the amounts of dcan and dcacam formed and the sources of nitrogen during chloramination figs s3 and s4 as shown in fig 3 a increasing the clo2 dose from 0 1 to 0 5 mm caused the unlabeled and 15n labeled dcan and dcacam yields during the subsequent chloramination of 3 min to increase gradually but increasing the clo2 dose further to 1 mm caused the dcan and dcacam yields to start to decrease this suggested that clo2 reacted with 3 min to form reactive intermediates that could form more dcan and dcacam but that excess clo2 might transform the intermediates further and therefore decrease the abilities of the intermediates to form dcan and dcacam clo2 pre oxidation increased the 14n percentage in the dcan formed from 3 min fig s4 indicating that clo2 pre oxidation increased 14n dcan formation more effectively than increasing 15n dcan formation during the chloramination of 3 min increasing the clo2 dose from 0 to 0 5 mm or increasing the pre oxidation time from 0 to 60 min caused the 14n dcacam yield during the subsequent chloramination of 2 hba to increase gradually but little affected the 15n dcacam yield figs 3 and s3 therefore gradually increased the 14n percentage for the dcacam that formed fig s4 this suggested that increasing the clo2 dose increased the amounts of nitrogenous intermediates that were formed through clo2 oxidation and that could supply nitrogen to dcacam formed during subsequent chloramination it also suggested that the intermediates were as reactive as 2 hba in terms of combining with nh2cl nitrogen to produce dcacam the 14n dcan and 15n dcan yields for the chloramination of 2 hba with clo2 pre oxidation decreased and then reached a plateau as the clo2 dose increased but the 14n percentage in the dcan that was formed during chloramination was not affected by clo2 pre oxidation fig s4 this suggested that clo2 pre oxidation decreased the amounts of 14n dcan and 15n dcan formed during the chloramination of 2 hba to similar degrees increasing the clo2 pre oxidation dose gradually decreased the 14n dcacam yield but first increased and then decreased the 15n dcacam yield when tc was chloraminated 14n dcacam was always the dominant product when tc was chloraminated after clo2 pre oxidation but the 14n dcacam contribution to the total dcacam yield decreased as the clo2 dose increased fig s4 this indicated that the clo2 pre oxidation products were less reactive than tc in terms of supplying nitrogen for the production of dcacam but were more reactive than tc in terms of combining with nh2cl nitrogen to produce dcacam the 14n percentage in the dcacam was always 50 and was higher than the 14n percentage in the dcan formed through the chloramination of 2 hba and tc under different clo2 pre oxidation conditions fig s4 this again suggested that nitrogen containing transformation products of 2 hba and tc formed during clo2 oxidation may supply nitrogen to directly produce dcacam during chloramination rather than dcacam forming through the hydrolysis of dcan clo2 pre oxidation decreased the amounts of dcan and dcacam formed from resorcinol combining with nh2cl nitrogen during chloramination increasing the clo2 dose decreased the amounts of dcan and dcacam that formed the results from these four compounds confirmed that clo2 pre oxidation affected dcan and dcacam formation during chloramination in different ways 3 2 pathways for dbp formation after clo2 pre oxidation 3 2 1 pathways for dbp formation from 3 min and trp a solution containing 3 min 0 1 mm was pre oxidized with clo2 0 25 mm at ph 7 0 and the intermediates formed were identified to investigate how clo2 pre oxidation increased the amounts of dcan and dcacam formed during the chloramination of indoles the gc ms total ion chromatogram contained several peaks for 3 min labeled p131 at retention time rt 17 5 min product p135 at rt 15 9 min product p161 at rt 16 8 min and product p163 at rt 19 2 min fig s5 the areas of the peaks for the three products changed but no new products were observed as the clo2 dose increased the molecular formulae and structures proposed for the three products using the nist database are shown in table 2 product p163 was dominant and had a higher peak area than 3 min and the other two products fig s5 the odd numbered nominal mass 163 da suggested that p163 contained an odd number of nitrogen atoms losses of 28 da between m z 163 and 135 and between m z 120 and 92 indicated that p163 contained two c o groups fig s6 we therefore propose p163 was n 2 acetylphenyl formamide the other products were identified using a similar method p161 contained an odd number of nitrogen atoms it had an odd numbered nominal mass of 161 da and two c o groups it lost 28 da between m z 146 and 118 and between m z 118 and 90 so we proposed that p161 was 2 acetylphenyl isocyanate fig s6 we concluded that p135 was 2 aminoacetophenone and verified this by analyzing a standard products p163 p161 and p135 are structurally similar to n formylkynurenine the isocyanate product and kynurenine shown in table s6 respectively which are the intermediates previously found in the reaction between clo2 and trp an amino acid containing an indole structure stewart et al 2008 casbeer et al 2013 based on the intermediates identified in this study and reported in previous studies we proposed the pathways for dcan and dcacam formation during chloramination of 3 min and trp after clo2 pre oxidation shown in fig 4 a clo2 reacts with 3 min or trp to form a highly reactive radical cation species and chlorite through an electron transfer reaction stewart et al 2008 the indole ring in the radical cation species then loses a proton to form the corresponding radical that further reacts with clo2 to form a 3 min oclo or trp oclo adduct stewart et al 2008 navalon et al 2009 the adduct is transformed into a stable product n 2 acetylphenyl formamide p163 or n formylkynurenine stewart et al 2008 and then oxidized by hocl hydrolyzed and decarboxylated to form the stable product 2 aminoecetophenone p135 or kynurenine tanaka et al 1976 casbeer et al 2013 therefore the stable intermediate products may lead to dcan and dcacam formation during subsequent chloramination the roles of the intermediates formed from clo2 oxidation of 3 min and trp in dcan and dcacam formation during chloramination were investigated by performing more dbp formation experiments using 2 aminoacetophenone and kynurenine which were the only intermediates for which standards were available as shown in fig s7 the 14n dcan and 15n dcan yields from 2 aminoacetophenone were about 3 9 and 1 7 times higher respectively than those from 3 min under the same chloramination conditions similar results were found for 14n dcacam and 15n dcacam therefore 2 aminoacetophenone formed during clo2 oxidation of 3 min may contribute to the increases in the amounts of dcan and dcacam formed from 3 min chloramination caused by clo2 pre oxidation however kynurenine exhibited lower dcan and dcacam yields than trp under the same chloramination conditions fig s7 therefore the increases in the amounts of dcan and dcacam formed from trp during chloramination after clo2 pre oxidation may have been caused by the other intermediates which needs further research 3 2 2 pathways for dbp formation from 2 hba clo2 pre oxidation of the three hydroxybenzamide compounds decreased the dcan yields but increased the dcacam yields during chloramination dcan and dcacam formation from 2 hba was most strongly affected so experiments using 2 hba were performed to further evaluate the pathways for dcan and dcacam formation during chloramination with and without clo2 pre oxidation three products were identified as the intermediates of the reaction between 2 hba 0 1 mm and nh2cl 1 mm without clo2 pre oxidation by gc ms and they were 5 chlorosalicylamide p171 3 chloro 2 hydroxy benzamide p171 and 3 5 dichloro 2 hydroxy benzamide p205 table s6 the electron impact ionization mass spectra of the products are shown in fig s8 from the products that were identified we proposed a possible pathway for dcan and dcacam formation through the reaction between 2 hba and nh2cl fig 4b chlorine substitution on the benzene ring will primarily occur at the positions para and ortho to the hydroxyl group during chloramination heasley et al 2004 so monochlorinated intermediates such as 5 chlorosalicylamide and 3 chloro 2 hydroxy benzamide are primarily formed during chloramination of 2 hba the monochlorinated product then reacts with nh2cl to form a dichlorinated product heasley et al 2004 which is 3 5 dichloro 2 hydroxy benzamide for 2 hba chloramination after a series of electrophilic substitutions decarboxylation and ring opening 3 5 dichloro 2 hydroxy benzamide will be converted into dcan and dcacam chuang et al 2015 nihemaiti et al 2016 the key intermediates in the reaction between 2 hba 0 1 mm and clo2 0 25 mm were identified by lc qtof ms in negative electrospray ionization mode product p169 rt 2 56 min was the dominant product found in the lc qtof ms spectrum table 2 and fig s9 p169 had a m z ratio of 168 0297 corresponding to a molecular formula of c7h7no4 which has two more oxygen atoms than 2 hba c7h7no2 a loss of 18 da was found between m z 168 and 150 indicating the loss of an oh h group p169 was therefore tentatively identified as formamid trans muconic acid this is structurally similar to monomethyl trans muconic acid which was found to be a product of 2 methoxyphenol and clo2 as shown in table s6 larson et al 1994 it has previously been found that the phenolate forms of phenolic compounds are the reactive species when clo2 oxidation is performed hoigné and bader 1994 the initial step in the oxidation of phenolic compounds by clo2 involves a one electron transfer from a phenolate hydroxyl group to generate a phenoxy radical with a series of resonance structures ni et al 1994 for 2 hba the phenoxy radical has a resonance structure with an unpaired electron on the amide substituted carbon atom the resonance structure can be attacked by clo2 to give an oclo adduct hydrolysis of which may lead to the formation of p169 we therefore proposed the pathways for reactions between 2 hba and clo2 shown in fig 4b during subsequent chloramination p169 probably undergoes chlorine substitution and hofmann rearrangement reactions to give a derivative of trans muconic acid yu and reckhow 2017 tanaka et al 1976 ding et al 2018 the derivative of trans muconic acid contains an amide group this amide group may be involved in the direct formation of 14n dcacam without a dcan intermediate during chloramination ding et al 2018 unfortunately no commercial standards for the proposed intermediates were available to allow dbp formation tests to be performed so it remains unclear whether these intermediates accounted for the increase in dcacam formation and decrease in dcan formation during the chloramination of 2 hba caused by clo2 pre oxidation three intermediates of the reaction between 4 hba 0 1 mm and clo2 0 25 mm were identified by gc ms the intermediates were 1 4 benzoquinone p108 hydroquinone p110 and chlorohydroquinone p144 table s7 and fig s10 1 4 benzoquinone has previously been found to be a product of the clo2 oxidation of 4 methoxyphenol and 4 carboxyphenol gan et al 2019 the dcan yields from the chloramination of 1 4 benzoquinone and hydroquinone were 0 89 and 0 92 respectively table 1 which were comparable to the dcan yield from the chloramination of 4 hba 1 03 the transformation of 4 hba into benzoquinone and hydroquinone after clo2 pre oxidation may therefore partly account for the slight decrease in dcan formation during chloramination when clo2 pre oxidation was performed 3 2 3 pathways for dbp formation from phenolic compounds pathways for reactions between resorcinol and clo2 or nh2cl have been proposed previously lin et al 1984 gan et al 2019 heasley et al 1999 nihemaiti et al 2016 the effects of clo2 pre oxidation on the dcan and dcacam formation pathways during chloramination of phenolic compounds therefore using resorcinol as an example are shown in fig 4c compounds i iii are previously identified intermediates in the reaction between resorcinol and nh2cl nihemaiti et al 2016 chloramination of resorcinol leads to the formation of a pentachlororesorcinol intermediate compound i which undergoes nitrogen attack from nh2cl ring cleavage and intramolecular nucleophilic substitution reactions to form a nitrogenous heterocyclic compound compound ii and finally to form n dbps illustrated as pathway 1 in fig 4c nihemaiti et al 2016 2 2 4 trichloro 1 3 cyclopentenedione compound iii is also formed from the pentachlororesorcinol intermediate through a series of reactions including oxygen attack from h2o and decarboxylation nihemaiti et al 2016 it has been found in many studies that unsaturated ketones including chloro trihydroxycyclohexadienones compound iv and 2 2 dichlorocyclopent 4 ene 1 3 dione compound ⅴ are frequently detected after clo2 oxidation of resorcinol lin et al 1984 jackson et al 1987 gan et al 2019 as shown in pathway 3 in fig 4c clo2 transforms resorcinol into five membered diketones e g compound ⅴ or its derivatives through electron transfer oxidation and decarboxylation reactions lin et al 1984 gan et al 2019 unfortunately no commercial standards for the five membered diketones were available for dbp formation tests and it is unclear whether the transformation from resorcinol into the five membered diketones by clo2 oxidation contributes to the decrease in the amounts of dcan and dcacam formed from resorcinol chloramination caused by clo2 pre oxidation clo2 pre oxidation generally decreased the amounts of dcan and dcacam formed from phenolic compounds particularly resorcinol and phenol during chloramination it has previously been found that 1 4 benzoquinone is a transformation product of clo2 oxidation of phenol and hydroquinone wajon et al 1982 ganiev et al 2003 wenk et al 2013 as shown in table 1 the dcan and dcacam yields from the chloramination of 1 4 benzoquinone were 0 89 and 0 34 respectively and were lower than those of phenol and hydroquinone after clo2 pre oxidation the transformation of phenol and hydroquinone into 1 4 benzoquinone therefore may decrease the dcan and dcacam yields during chloramination 3 3 effects of clo2 pre oxidation on the formation and nitrogen origins of dcan and dcacam from water samples dcan and dcacam formation in real water samples and the sources of nitrogen in the dcan and dcacam formed during chloramination with and without clo2 pre oxidation were also investigated figs 5 and s11 the water samples contain bromide and therefore dcan and dcacam only represent a fraction of the dihaloacetonitriles acetamides without clo2 pretreatment the dcan and dcacam concentrations were 1 40 4 41 and 4 03 10 42 μg l respectively fig 5 the 14n percentages in the dcan and dcacam produced were 23 30 and 22 39 respectively indicating that nitrogen used to form dcan and dcacam in the water samples was mostly supplied by nh2cl fig s11 which agreed with the results of previous studies huang et al 2012 le roux et al 2016 with the possible exception of dcacam formation in surface water samples s1 and s5 clo2 pre oxidation decreased the unlabeled and 15n labeled dcan and dcacam yields during the chloramination of all water samples and the decreases increased in magnitude as the clo2 dose increased fig 5 for example clo2 pre oxidation using the highest clo2 dose 1 5 doc concentration decreased the total dcan 14n dcan and 15n dcan yields by 49 70 31 52 and 55 76 respectively clo2 pre oxidation of samples s1 and s5 decreased the 14n dcacam yield but increased the 15n dcacam yield and the total dcacam yield in sample s5 was slightly increased by clo2 pre treatment clo2 pre oxidation decreased the dcacam yields less as percentages than the dcan yields during chloramination of all water samples suggesting that clo2 pre oxidation removed dcan precursors more effectively than dcacam precursors from the water samples it is interesting that clo2 pre oxidation decreased the 15n dcan yield more than the 14n dcan yield for every water sample and therefore increased the contribution of 14n dcan to the total dcan concentration but had the opposite effect for dcacam fig s11 this suggested that clo2 mainly breaks the dominant dcan formation pathway through which nitrogen in dcan is supplied by nh2cl but mainly breaks the dcacam formation pathway through which nitrogen in dcacam is supplied by organic precursors the results of our model compound study above indicated that the phenolic compounds that account for 21 of the total carbon in humic substances norwood et al 1987 gave relatively high dcan and dcacam yields during chloramination table 1 suggesting that phenolic compounds are important dcan and dcacam precursors clo2 pre oxidation generally decreased the amounts of dcan and dcacam formed during the chloramination of phenolic compounds the decreases in 15n labeled dcan and dcacam yields during the chloramination of water samples caused by clo2 oxidation may therefore have been caused by phenolic precursors in the water samples being destroyed by oxidation by clo2 clo2 pre oxidation also decreased the amounts of 14n dcan and 14n dcacam formed during chloramination of the water samples but increased the amounts formed during chloramination of the amino acids that we used free amino acids typically make small contributions to total dissolved organic nitrogen concentrations in water samples and macromolecular proteins are usually the dominant contributors of dissolved organic nitrogen westerhoff and mash 2002 we therefore performed experiments using bsa to investigate the effects of clo2 pre oxidation on dbp formation the results are shown in table s8 unlabeled and 15n labeled n dbp formation was suppressed by clo2 pre oxidation clo2 pre oxidation decreased the 14n dcan and 14n dcacam yields during the chloramination of bsa by 11 20 and 14 22 respectively this was consistent with the results for the water samples it has previously been found that clo2 can modify many tyr residue sites in bsa to form different peptides and that clo2 oxidation of some peptides containing tyr residues gives different products from the products of clo2 oxidation of free tyr ogata 2007 unlike for tyr clo2 pre oxidation of tyr ala decreased the dcan yield during chloramination fig 2 we therefore speculate that reactions between clo2 and macromolecular proteins in water samples may decrease the dcan and dcacam particularly 14n dcan and 14n dcacam yields during chloramination after clo2 oxidation furthermore clo2 oxidation decreased the dcan yields during the chloramination of hydroxybenzamide compounds and decreased the dcacam yields during the chloramination of tetracyclines unfortunately these two groups of model compounds were not quantified in the water samples and it is unclear whether these compounds are precursors that could contribute to the mitigation of n dbp production caused by pre treating water with clo2 4 conclusions the effects of clo2 pre oxidation on dcan and dcacam formation and the sources of nitrogen in the dcan and dcacam formed during chloramination of 28 model compounds and seven real water samples were investigated clo2 pre oxidation caused four different types of changes in the dcan and dcacam yields during chloramination of the model compounds clo2 pre oxidation increased the dcan and dcacam yields during the chloramination of six amino acids and peptides and five indoles and tertiary amines through pathways involving both organic matter and monochloramine as nitrogen sources clo2 pre oxidation of three hydroxybenzamide compounds inhibited dcan formation but promoted dcacam formation during chloramination however clo2 pre oxidation increased the dcan yields but significantly decreased the dcacam particularly 14n dcacam yields during chloramination of tetracycline antibiotics clo2 pre oxidation generally decreased the amounts of dcan and dcacam formed through phenolic compounds particularly resorcinol and phenol combining with nh2cl nitrogen during chloramination the different effects of clo2 pre oxidation on dcan and dcacam formation became clearer as the clo2 dose increased pathways for dcan and dcacam formation during chloramination of 3 min trp 2 hba and resorcinol after clo2 pre oxidation were proposed based on intermediates that were identified 2 aminoacetophenone which was found to be a product of clo2 oxidation of 3 min may contribute to the increases in dcan and dcacam yields during 3 min chloramination caused by clo2 pre oxidation similarly transformation of phenol and hydroquinone into 1 4 benzoquinone may decrease the dcan and dcacam yields during chloramination clo2 pre oxidation generally decreased the dcan and dcacam yields by 36 70 and 11 59 respectively during chloramination of the water samples furthermore clo2 pre oxidation of the water samples increased the contribution of 14n dcan to the total dcan concentration but decreased the contribution of 14n dcacam to the total dcacam concentration the decreases in dcan and dcacam yields during chloramination of water samples caused by clo2 oxidation may be caused by clo2 oxidation destroying phenolic precursors and

17516,the successful use of advanced oxidation processes to treat aqueous solutions containing undesirable organic species requires the degradation of these species to lower molecular weight lower hazard compounds safe application of this technology requires a thorough understanding of the mechanisms of degradation these oxidative transformations are mainly initiated by the reactions of reactive oxygen species particularly hydroxyl radicals these react with organic molecules to generate carbon centered radicals in the presence of dissolved oxygen the carbon centered radicals are next converted to peroxyl radicals which then decay to lower molecular weight species by multiple mechanistic pathways formic acid and its conjugate base formate are the last stable chemical species produced immediately before the complete mineralization of any organic molecule undergoing oxidative degradation in aqueous solution once understood the radical induced chemistry of formic acid formate under these conditions has wide applicability in all advanced oxidation technologies to develop this quantitative knowledge we have performed a series of 60co gamma irradiation studies on aqueous formic acid formate over different ph and solution conditions the measured species concentration changes as a function of applied dose are compared with the predictions of a kinetic computer model constructed from literature reactions and reported rate coefficients the excellent agreement found between the results and modeling gives confidence in the mechanism presented here and provide the first complete computer model for the radiolytic degradation of formic acid in water graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords formic acid formate radical induced degradation kinetic model advanced oxidation processes 1 introduction the removal of organic contaminants from water is important to both industrial water re use and for potable water purification meeting the demands of an increasing world population necessitates more effective water remediation technologies particularly as current treatment processes using chemical disinfectants have been shown to produce hazardous disinfection byproducts such as nitrosamines mccurry et al 2017 pehlivanoglu mantas et al 2006 halonitromethanes du et al 2020 mezyk et al 2012 mincher et al 2010 and haloacetic acids wang et al 2020 wang et al 2020 for example the reformation of n nitrosodimethylamine ndma after its initial removal from wastewater using free chlorine pehlivanoglu mantas et al 2006 and chloramines mccurry et al 2017 has been well documented further increasing levels of emerging pollutants of concern richardson and kimura 2020 especially pesticides ikehata and el din 2005 estrogenic hormones huang et al 2020 mezyk et al 2010 and various pharmaceuticals and their metabolites ikehata et al 2006 require consideration of alternative treatments many alternatives have been proposed including physical contaminant removal using activated carbon adsorption ternes et al 2002 and membrane filtration nghiem et al 2005 advanced oxidation processes aops such as direct deep ultra violet illumination chen et al 2019 moussavi et al 2019 ozonation ternes et al 2002 and even electron beam irradiation cooper et al 1998 have been specifically championed ikehata and el din 2005 ikehata and el din 2004 oppenlander 2003 zhou and smith 2002 alvarez et al 2001 as the appropriate technology to supplement current water and wastewater treatment options as they offer the possibility of the ultimate mineralization of organic contaminants as opposed to just physical removal cooper et al 2008 many full scale aop treatment facilities currently exist in various parts of the world upon application of an aop organic compounds in aqueous solution are degraded to lower molecular weight organic species depending on the application of the aop effluent water various levels of organic contaminant mineralization are necessary these range from only effluent release to the environment where sufficient treatment to meet regulatory discharge limits for hazardous chemicals is met but only minimal overall organic oxidation occurs to the production of potable water for direct reuse where the more stringent drinking water standards requires a very high level of organic chemical mineralization most aops rely on the in situ production and subsequent chemistry of the hydroxyl radical oh eo 2 7 v buxton et al 1988 to oxidatively react with organic compounds via hydrogen atom abstraction electrophilic addition radical radical addition or electron transfer mechanisms the application of ionizing radiation using isotope gamma sources or electron beams is a powerful way to generate the oh radical in water since water is the most abundant constituent of an aqueous solution ionizing radiation energy is directly deposited into this solvent to produce a suite of both oxidizing oh and reducing h eaq radicals molecular species h2 h2o2 and ions haq according to the stoichiometry buxton et al 1988 1 h2o 0 28 oh 0 06 h 0 27 eaq 0 05 h2 0 07 h2o2 0 27 haq where the numbers in brackets are the radiolytic yields μmol j 1 of each produced species for neutral ph water irradiation the subsequent reactions of these primary water radiolysis species with organic solutes determine the effectiveness of an ionizing radiation driven aop this chemistry can be kinetically quantified into a predictive computer model through the use of the scavenging capacity k k x s the pseudo first order rate coefficient k obtained as the product of the solute concentration s and the corresponding absolute second order rate coefficient k for the reaction these reactions are characterized by the cleavage of carbon carbon carbon hydrogen and carbon heteroatom bonds resulting in the formation of a variety of organic and heteroatom radical fragments continued irradiation leads to further decomposition into smaller stable molecules for any organic species the penultimate step in the mineralization process is the formation and subsequent degradation of formic acid hcooh and its conjugate base formate hco2 it is the reactions of these species with the oh radical that are considered in this work previous studies have reported the formation of the carboxyl radical cooh co2 pignatello et al 2006 buxton et al 1988 zechner and getoff 1974 neta et al 1969 rabani and stein 1962 2 hcooh oh cooh h2o k 1 4 108 m 1 s 1 3 hco2 oh co2 h2o k 2 6 109 m 1 s 1 at solution ph 3 co2 reacts to produce co2 either through electron transfer or by disproportionation fricke et al 1938 respectively 4 co2 o2 co2 o2 k 2 4 109 m 1 s 1 5 co2 co2 haq co2 hco2 k 6 5 108 m 1 s 1 while this conservative reaction set represents the mineralization of formic acid formate it is by no means a complete description of all the reactions that can occur for example the dimerization of the co2 radical proceeds via either a head to tail 90 or a head to head recombination of its two mesomeric forms flyunt et al 2001 head to tail dimerization produces a carbanion ococoo2 which rearranges to yield oxalate ooc coo thus generating a higher molecular weight species eq 6 alternately it may undergo protonation to form a mixed anhydride ococooh that ultimately decomposes to give co2 and formate leading toward mineralization eq 7 6 co2 coo ococoo2 ooc coo 7 co2 coo ococoo2 haq ococooh co2 hco2 head to head dimerization 10 directly yields the oxalate anion ooc coo 8 2 co2 ooc coo these reactions of ococoo2 account for the ph dependency of product formation for phs 3 oxalate is the major degradation product eq 6 keene et al 1965 neta et al 1969 while at phs 3 protonation and subsequent decomposition of the carbanion dominates eq 7 these reactions link the free radical induced chemistry of formic and oxalic acids and their respective conjugate bases in addition to ph the redox potential of the system controlled by the concentration of dissolved oxygen can also affect degradation unlike some other aop approaches the irradiation of water also produces strongly reducing radicals as well as the oh radical eq 1 the hydrated electron eaq eo 2 9 v buxton et al 1988 and the hydrogen atom h eo 2 3 v buxton et al 1988 are also capable of reacting with formic acid formate buxton et al 1988 9 hcooh eaq h2o cooh h2 oh k 1 4 108 m 1 s 1 10 hcooh h cooh h2 k 4 4 105 m 1 s 1 11 hco2 eaq h2o co2 h2 oh k 8 103 m 1 s 1 12 hco2 h co2 h2 k 2 1 108 m 1 s 1 however these reducing species are scavenged when dissolved oxygen is present limiting their contribution to formate degradation thus it is clear that the effectiveness of an aop will be significantly impacted by solution ph redox potential and also the presence of other solutes that act as radical scavengers notably the natural organic matter nom and carbonate species inevitably present in real world waters to optimize the effectiveness for mineralization it is necessary to develop a predictive quantitative kinetic computer model for all the possible chemical transformations occurring to date there is no complete kinetic computer model describing the mineralization of formic acid formate therefore here we report such a model using experimental results for the gamma radiation induced degradation of formic acid formate in conjunction with literature data irradiation experiments were performed under various conditions of ph and redox potential to evaluate the effects of hydronium ion concentration dissolved oxygen concentration and oh radical yield on mineralization we note that although the focus here is on the ultimate mineralization of organic contaminants for water treatment these reactions also occur in such disparate areas as nuclear fuel reprocessing mincher and mezyk 2009 the formation of interstellar organic species gopalsamy et al 2019 and in the photolysis of atmospheric aerosols campbell et al 2019 and surface waters yan et al 2019 2 methods 2 1 chemicals sodium formate 99 998 trace metals basis sodium hydroxide naoh 50 solution hplc grade perchloric acid hclo4 99 999 trace metals basis and sulfuric acid h2so4 99 999 were supplied by sigma aldrich all chemicals were used as received without further purification compressed air nitrogen n2 and nitrous oxide n2o were purchased in their highest available purity from norco ultra pure water 18 mώ was used to make up all solutions 2 2 irradiation procedure the idaho national laboratory center for radiation chemistry research nordion gammacell 220e 60co irradiator was used to irradiate samples over a series of absorbed doses at an average dose rate of 1 13 gy min 1 for formate samples and 0 90 gy min 1 for formic acid samples dose rates were determined by fricke dosimetry fricke and hart 1935 and subsequently corrected for 60co decay τ1 2 5 27 years for each of 13 sample holder positions samples were comprised of 4 0 ml of ph adjusted 1 5 or 9 0 through addition of hclo4 h2so4 or naoh respectively aqueous 1 0 mm sodium formate sealed in 20 ml crimp cap vials irradiated either as they were prepared sealed with an air headspace or sparged with specific gases for reasons discussed in section 3 to examine deaerated or highly oxidizing conditions samples were sparged inside an equilibrated environmental chamber with n2 or n2o respectively prior to irradiation initial dissolved oxygen concentrations were believed to be 10 μm for both these systems butler et al 1994 for aerated conditions samples were continually sparged during irradiation with tank compressed air regulated by a mass flow controller at 1 ml min 1 thus keeping the dissolved oxygen concentration at ambient air levels ca 250 μm irradiations run in sealed containers also had this initial oxygen level sample irradiations were run in quintuplicate post irradiation the ph of each sample was re measured with negligible difference found 2 3 high performance liquid chromatography hplc quantification of all carboxylic acids formic acid formate oxalic acid and oxalate was performed by hplc using a waters alliance e2695 separations module with a waters photodiode array pda detector the analysis was carried out on a biorad aminex hpx 87h column 300 mm 7 8 mm 5 μm particle size the method used 0 022 m h2so4 in water as the mobile phase with a flow rate of 0 6 ml min 1 and a column temperature of 35 c the pda measurements were extracted from the 210 nm channel using retention times and peak heights compared to standards this afforded 1 percent relative standard deviation rsd for integrated curve areas and limits of detection of 0 04 mm for formate formic acid and 0 007 mm for oxalate oxalic acid 2 4 gas chromatography gc headspace gas of post irradiation non air sparged samples was predominantly analyzed for molecular hydrogen h2 and carbon dioxide co2 by gc using an agilent technologies santa clara ca usa 7890 series ii gc with flame ionization detection gc fid for quantification of co2 a poraplot u chrompack 25 m 0 32 mm id 10 µm df column was used with an injector temperature of 150 c and an isothermal oven temperature of 50 c for 2 5 minutes the split ratio was 5 1 with 1 5 ml min 1 helium flow through the column the fid temperature was 200 c and the retention time of co2 was 2 18 minutes for sealed and air sparged samples the reported values for co2 were corrected for the ambient concentration of co2 in air for quantification of h2 o2 and n2 a hp molesieve agilent technologies 30 m 0 53 mm id 50 µm

analyzed at the mid point of the analysis and at the end to ensure validity of the calibration curve throughout the entire measurement period this procedure afforded uncertainties of 10 for all headspace gas measurements prior to use the crimp cap sample vials were assessed for gas retention integrity as a function of both time and absorbed gamma dose and were found to be more than suitable for the duration of these irradiations the average h2 leak rate was 0 08 h 1 and the average co2 leak rate was 0 13 h 1 2 5 kinetic model calculations a deterministic reaction kinetics model was constructed to provide a quantitative mechanistic description of the radiolytic degradation of formic acid formate under the variety of chemical conditions expected within an aop system in this model reactions are expressed as a series of coupled ordinary differential equations and solved using the facsimle numerical algorithm mcpa software 2020 primary water radiolysis yields and the water radiolysis chemical reaction set were sourced from buxton et al 1988 and elliot and bartels 2009 the chemical reaction compilation employed for modeling the chemistry of formic acid formate were obtained from published literature where experimental data were absent kinetic parameters were optimized using program fitting to the measured experimental concentration profiles of this study a complete reaction set for formic acid formate is given in supplementary data table s1 the associated data in brief table 9 a simple stagnant two film model whitman 1923 was implemented for gas partitioning between aqueous and gaseous phases for which standard henry s coefficients sander 1999 and temperature dependent diffusivity parameters cadogan et al 2014 kallikragas et al 2014 massman 1998 were used the interfacial area for mass transfer was optimized to provide the best fit to gc data 3 results and discussion 3 1 radiolytic degradation of formate hco2 at ph 9 0 to elucidate the radiolysis mechanism of formic acid the respective chemistries of this acid and its conjugate base pka 3 77 buxton et al 1988 must be resolved to this end sodium formate solutions were adjusted to either ph 1 5 or 9 0 ensuring the steady state predominance one of the species under a given set of conditions as most aop systems operate under neutral to alkaline conditions the ph 9 0 systems will be addressed first the gamma radiolysis of ph 9 0 sodium formate and subsequent ingrowth of oxalate in a variety of aqueous solutions is given in fig 1 for all four solution conditions it can be seen that the kinetic computer modeling predictions solid curves are in excellent agreement with experiment the deviation predicted in oxalate formation seen in fig 1 b for n2o sparged conditions highlights the limitations in the employed reaction set for oxalate radiolysis gordeev et al 2005 this chemistry is the subject of analogous experiments and calculations that specifically investigate aqueous radical induced oxalate degradation that are currently underway the mechanism for the degradation of formate is generally assumed to be primarily driven by reaction with the oh radical liberating the co2 radical as shown in eq 3 the fate of the co2 radical is one of the factors that determines the extent of mineralization and thus the effectiveness of an aop system if o2 is present fig 1 a sealed and air sparged the co2 radical is expected to be rapidly scavenged by o2 to yield co2 and the superoxide radical o2 as shown in eq 4 the co2 may then either diffuse out of solution or undergo hydration to form a variety of carbonate species depending upon ph in the absence of o2 fig 1 a n2 and n2o sparged the co2 radical may instead undergo dimerization as shown in eqs 6 and 8 possibly resulting in oxalate formation rather than mineralization in a continually air equilibrated aop system with a constant dissolved o2 concentration the air sparged conditions shown in fig 1 are applicable here the formate concentration degrades almost linearly with absorbed gamma dose affording a g value of 0 36 µm j 1 fig 1 a the fundamental processes responsible for these observations are highlighted by the calculated cumulative reaction pathway concentrations shown in fig 2 for formate and the co2 radical a cumulative reaction pathway concentration is the sum concentration of a single product produced by a given reaction this parameter tracks the relative contribution by a reaction to the total fate of a reactant since the o2 concentration is maintained at 0 25 mm the formate and co2 radical reducing reactions involving the eaq and h atom eqs 11 14 buxton et al 1988 are suppressed because they cannot compete with the diffusion limited scavenging reactions shown in eqs 15 and 16 13 co2 eaq h2o hco2 oh k 9 109 m 1 s 1 14 co2 h hco2 k 9 109 m 1 s 1 15 o2 eaq o2 k 1 9 1010 m 1 s 1 16 o2 h ho2 k 1 2 1010 m 1 s 1 thus formate degradation is predominantly driven by reaction with the oh radical fig 2 a the co2 radical is quantitatively consumed by dissolved oxygen eq 4 fig 2 b and mineralization is therefore expected under aerated conditions the corresponding formation of oxalate is inhibited as seen in fig 1 b at ph 9 0 the co2 resulting from eq 4 undergoes hydration to yield carbonate species this is consistent with the absence of co2 in the corresponding gc data given in fig 3 a for irradiated sealed conditions here we also see the production of h2 from the radiolysis of water eq 1 but no other gaseous products the n2 sparged data shown in fig 1 represents a deaerated anoxic system as with the air sparged system formate degrades almost linearly with absorbed dose affording a similar g value of 0 33 µm j 1 this is somewhat surprising considering the eaq and h atom are no longer being scavenged by o2 eqs 15 and 16 and thus would be expected to enhance the rate of formate degradation our model calculations fig 4 a show that both the oh radical and h atom contribute 81 and 18 to total formate degradation respectively under these irradiated sealed conditions however the additional degradation afforded by the h atom is apparently counterbalanced by reformation of formate through eq 13 under these ph 9 0 n2 sparged conditions co2 radical degradation occurs by 77 dimerization eqs 6 and 8 and 22 by reaction with the eaq eq 13 as shown in fig 4 b in the absence of o2 dimerization of the co2 radical under alkaline conditions eq 6 and 8 results in the formation of oxalate which grows in linearly with a g value of 0 1 µm j 1 as shown and successfully modeled in fig 1 b as the oh radical is the predominant species utilized by aop systems additives such as h2o2 are often added to enhance this radicals yield here n2o sparging was used to simulate this effect enhancing the yield of the oh radical through conversion of the eaq and h atom buxton et al 1988 czapski and peled 1968 17 n2o eaq n2 o k 9 1 109 m 1 s 1 18 n2o h n2 oh k 2 1 106 m 1 s 1 19 o h2o oh oh pka 11 84 mezyk 1996 as expected the rate of formate degradation was significantly enhanced due to n2o sparging affording a g value of 0 64 µm j 1 as seen in fig 1 a this is almost double that for the air and n2 sparged systems consistent with the expected doubling of the g value for the oh radical yield however it was found from our calculations fig 5 a that the increased rate of formate degradation is mainly due to formate reaction with the oxide radical anion o directly yielded by eqs 17 and 19 under alkaline conditions 20 hco2 o co2 oh k 1 0 109 m 1 s 1 the model optimized rate coefficient value for eq 20 is in very good agreement with the single experimental determination in the literature k 1 4 109 m 1 s 1 buxton 1969 although the o radical has a slightly slower rate coefficient than the oh radical with formate 2 2 5 1 109 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 this reaction is not slow enough to be neglected especially as investigated formate concentrations are in significant excess of all other o radical competitors consequently formate degradation occurs 62 by reaction with the oh radical eq 3 31 by reaction with the o radical eq 20 6 by reaction with the h atom and 1 by reaction with the carbonate radical co3 eq 21 as shown in fig 5 a 21 hco2 co3 hco3 co2 k 1 5 105 m 1 s 1 the h contribution reflects a combination of progressive radiolytic consumption of n2o and its corresponding rate coefficient being significantly slower than that for the eaq eqs 17 and 18 since sparging with n2o also displaces o2 the majority of the co2 radical 73 is converted into oxalate by addition reactions at high ph as shown in fig 1 b the remaining co2 radical is consumed by radiolytically produced o2 14 h2o2 9 eq 22 and hco3 4 eq 23 as shown in fig 5 b 22 co2 h2o2 co2 oh oh k 2 0 105 m 1 s 1 23 co2 hco3 co3 hco2 k 2 0 104 m 1 s 1 the model optimized rate coefficient value for eq 23 is again in very good agreement with previous literature values k 6 105 m 1 s 1 schwarz 1992 both h2o2 and hco3 accumulate in solution with absorbed dose through water radiolysis eq 1 and hydration of radiolytically produced co2 respectively the contribution from o2 eq 4 under these conditions arises from its production through the combination of eqs 24 and 25 24 ho2 oh o2 h2o 25 co3 o2 co3 2 o2 k 6 5 108 m 1 s 1 under these n2o sparged alkaline conditions 1 0 mm formate is completely consumed in less than 2 kgy fig 1 a resulting in the onset of radiolytic oxalate decomposition at that absorbed dose as also shown in fig 1 b fig 1 also shows data for an initially air equilibrated solution that was sealed and irradiated these conditions are of relevance for scenarios at later stages in aop water treatment where the irradiated system may become depleted of dissolved o2 due to the occurrence of radical reactions eqs 4 15 and 16 as can be seen in fig 1 a the behavior of formate mirrors that of the air sparged system until the concentration of o2 falls below a critical concentration 0 1 mm for effectively scavenging all of the eaq h and co2 radicals this manifests as an inflection point in the data in fig 1 a analysis of the corresponding calculated cumulative reaction pathways in fig 6 reveal that the sudden change in profile is a consequence of h2o2 accumulated from water radiolysis scavenging the now available eaq to yield additional oh radical buxton et al 1988 26 h2o2 eaq oh oh k 1 2 1010 m 1 s 1 this is demonstrated here by the spike in oh radical contribution to formate degradation in fig 6 a eq 3 and the simultaneous plateau region for the reaction of the co2 radical with h2o2 in fig 6 b eq 22 further enhancement of formate degradation with o2 depletion occurs by the reaction of formate with the now available h atom eq 12 these two processes lead to accelerated formate degradation and ultimately oxalate formation as shown in fig 1 b 3 2 radiolytic degradation of formic acid hcooh at ph 1 5 in acidic solutions the formic acid dissociation equilibrium pka 3 77 buxton et al 1988 is pushed to the left allowing for the radiation chemistry of formic acid to be probed the gamma radiolysis of a ph 1 5 solution of initially 1 0 mm sodium formate under the same set of solution conditions as above for ph 9 0 samples is given in fig 7 once again kinetic computer modeling predictions solid curves are in excellent agreement with experiment under all four solution conditions in the gas sparged systems formic acid again degrades almost linearly with increasing absorbed dose affording g values of 0 22 air sparged 0 27 n2 sparged and 0 39 n2o sparged µm j 1 these rates are slightly slower than the corresponding alkaline formate systems which is explained by the nearly factor of 20 slower rate coefficient for the oh radical reaction with formic acid 1 4 108 m 1 s 1 vs 2 6 109 m 1 s 1 for formate buxton et al 1988 interestingly sparging with n2 accelerates formic acid degradation relative to the corresponding air sparged system in contrast to the formate results for ph 9 0 the lower ph of this system results in a higher scavenging capacity for both pre solvated electrons epre and eaq because they are both rapidly scavenged by haq and converted to h atom pimblott and laverne 1998 27 e 110 fs e p r e 240 fs e a q 28 epre haq h k 2 18 1012 m 1 s 1 29 eaq haq h k 2 3 1010 m 1 s 1 this ensures inhibition of eaq reactions and enhancement of h atom processes preventing reformation of formate formic acid via the reaction of the co2 radical with the eaq eq 13 and promotes its decomposition due to the enhanced yield of h atom eqs 10 and 12 additionally under acidic conditions co2 is now available for reaction with h atom keene et al 1965 30 h co2 cooh k 1 106 m 1 s 1 decreasing the extent of reformation of formate formic acid through eqs 14 and 31 31 cooh h hcooh k 9 109 m 1 s 1 these ph effects are evident from our ph 1 5 n2 sparged calculations shown in fig 8 a wherein formic acid degradation occurs 59 by reaction with the oh radical eqs 2 and 3 and 41 by reaction with the h atom eqs 10 and 12 over double the h atom contribution when compared to the corresponding ph 9 0 calculations shown in fig 4 a further in fig 8 b the contribution of h atom to the reformation of formate formic acid eqs 14 and 31 is 70 less than reformation by eaq eq 13 shown in fig 4 b under all four acidic formic acid irradiation conditions no oxalic acid oxalate species were detected instead co2 was measured as shown in fig 3 b for the corresponding sealed system this was as expected because increased acidity not only drives carbonate equilibria toward co2 formation 32 co3 2 haq hco3 haq h2co3 co2 h2o it also promotes protonation of the head to tail co2 radical dimerization mixed anhydride product allowing for its decomposition to co2 as shown in eq 7 for the n2o sparged solutions the rate of formic acid degradation was again enhanced over that for air sparged solutions although to not as great a degree as seen at ph 9 0 this is attributed to the loss of eaq to acid scavenging eq 29 leaving only the h atom component available for conversion to the oh radical by n2o eq 18 for which the corresponding rate coefficient is 4 orders of magnitude slower than that with the eaq eq 17 consequently 1 of formic acid degradation occurs via reaction with the h atom the rest is with the oh radical eq 3 as acidity drives eq 19 to the left resulting in negligible contribution from the o radical fig 9 a finally it can also be seen in fig 7 that for the sealed system formic acid degradation initially mirrors that of the air sparged samples this is expected and consistent with behavior in the ph 9 0 samples in which o2 inhibits eaq and h reactions eqs 15 and 16 once again an inflection point is seen in the data once the dissolved o2 content has been sufficiently depleted by radiolytic processes at this point the data begins to mirror the n2o sparged solution consistent with the now available eaq being converted to h atom eq 29 thereby inhibiting formic acid reformation by eq 13 and promoting accelerated degradation through eqs 10 and 12 as shown in fig 10 4 conclusions since formic acid formate are the last stable chemical species produced immediately prior to complete mineralization of organic pollutants in aqueous solution their fates are of interest in the long term irradiation of all organic compounds in this study we report on the construction of a complete predicative quantitative computer kinetic model for the gamma radiolysis of formic acid and its conjugate base formate as a function of absorbed dose under both acidic ph 1 5 and alkaline ph 9 0 conditions for both carboxylic acid species radiation induced degradation is primarily driven by reaction with the oh radical with the extent of mineralization dictated by the fate of the co2 radical comparison of degradation rates and the fundamental reaction mechanisms for formic acid and formate radiolysis revealed the following i acidic conditions favored complete mineralization of formic acid through protonation and subsequent hydrolysis of the head to tail co2 radical dimerization mixed anhydride product ii alkaline conditions promoted the formation of oxalate iii strongly oxidizing conditions favored a faster degradation rate and iv dissolved o2 inhibits the rate of degradation by consuming the reducing products of water radiolysis overall acidic oxidizing conditions can be recommended for an effective aop process further the product oxalate formed under near neutral ph conditions is also expected to undergo radical induced degradation possibly re forming formate formic acid in this computer model we have focused on quantitatively establishing the ph dependent aqueous radical chemistry of formate formic acid degradation analogous experiments and calculations that specifically investigate radical induced oxalate degradation are presently

17516,the successful use of advanced oxidation processes to treat aqueous solutions containing undesirable organic species requires the degradation of these species to lower molecular weight lower hazard compounds safe application of this technology requires a thorough understanding of the mechanisms of degradation these oxidative transformations are mainly initiated by the reactions of reactive oxygen species particularly hydroxyl radicals these react with organic molecules to generate carbon centered radicals in the presence of dissolved oxygen the carbon centered radicals are next converted to peroxyl radicals which then decay to lower molecular weight species by multiple mechanistic pathways formic acid and its conjugate base formate are the last stable chemical species produced immediately before the complete mineralization of any organic molecule undergoing oxidative degradation in aqueous solution once understood the radical induced chemistry of formic acid formate under these conditions has wide applicability in all advanced oxidation technologies to develop this quantitative knowledge we have performed a series of 60co gamma irradiation studies on aqueous formic acid formate over different ph and solution conditions the measured species concentration changes as a function of applied dose are compared with the predictions of a kinetic computer model constructed from literature reactions and reported rate coefficients the excellent agreement found between the results and modeling gives confidence in the mechanism presented here and provide the first complete computer model for the radiolytic degradation of formic acid in water graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords formic acid formate radical induced degradation kinetic model advanced oxidation processes 1 introduction the removal of organic contaminants from water is important to both industrial water re use and for potable water purification meeting the demands of an increasing world population necessitates more effective water remediation technologies particularly as current treatment processes using chemical disinfectants have been shown to produce hazardous disinfection byproducts such as nitrosamines mccurry et al 2017 pehlivanoglu mantas et al 2006 halonitromethanes du et al 2020 mezyk et al 2012 mincher et al 2010 and haloacetic acids wang et al 2020 wang et al 2020 for example the reformation of n nitrosodimethylamine ndma after its initial removal from wastewater using free chlorine pehlivanoglu mantas et al 2006 and chloramines mccurry et al 2017 has been well documented further increasing levels of emerging pollutants of concern richardson and kimura 2020 especially pesticides ikehata and el din 2005 estrogenic hormones huang et al 2020 mezyk et al 2010 and various pharmaceuticals and their metabolites ikehata et al 2006 require consideration of alternative treatments many alternatives have been proposed including physical contaminant removal using activated carbon adsorption ternes et al 2002 and membrane filtration nghiem et al 2005 advanced oxidation processes aops such as direct deep ultra violet illumination chen et al 2019 moussavi et al 2019 ozonation ternes et al 2002 and even electron beam irradiation cooper et al 1998 have been specifically championed ikehata and el din 2005 ikehata and el din 2004 oppenlander 2003 zhou and smith 2002 alvarez et al 2001 as the appropriate technology to supplement current water and wastewater treatment options as they offer the possibility of the ultimate mineralization of organic contaminants as opposed to just physical removal cooper et al 2008 many full scale aop treatment facilities currently exist in various parts of the world upon application of an aop organic compounds in aqueous solution are degraded to lower molecular weight organic species depending on the application of the aop effluent water various levels of organic contaminant mineralization are necessary these range from only effluent release to the environment where sufficient treatment to meet regulatory discharge limits for hazardous chemicals is met but only minimal overall organic oxidation occurs to the production of potable water for direct reuse where the more stringent drinking water standards requires a very high level of organic chemical mineralization most aops rely on the in situ production and subsequent chemistry of the hydroxyl radical oh eo 2 7 v buxton et al 1988 to oxidatively react with organic compounds via hydrogen atom abstraction electrophilic addition radical radical addition or electron transfer mechanisms the application of ionizing radiation using isotope gamma sources or electron beams is a powerful way to generate the oh radical in water since water is the most abundant constituent of an aqueous solution ionizing radiation energy is directly deposited into this solvent to produce a suite of both oxidizing oh and reducing h eaq radicals molecular species h2 h2o2 and ions haq according to the stoichiometry buxton et al 1988 1 h2o 0 28 oh 0 06 h 0 27 eaq 0 05 h2 0 07 h2o2 0 27 haq where the numbers in brackets are the radiolytic yields μmol j 1 of each produced species for neutral ph water irradiation the subsequent reactions of these primary water radiolysis species with organic solutes determine the effectiveness of an ionizing radiation driven aop this chemistry can be kinetically quantified into a predictive computer model through the use of the scavenging capacity k k x s the pseudo first order rate coefficient k obtained as the product of the solute concentration s and the corresponding absolute second order rate coefficient k for the reaction these reactions are characterized by the cleavage of carbon carbon carbon hydrogen and carbon heteroatom bonds resulting in the formation of a variety of organic and heteroatom radical fragments continued irradiation leads to further decomposition into smaller stable molecules for any organic species the penultimate step in the mineralization process is the formation and subsequent degradation of formic acid hcooh and its conjugate base formate hco2 it is the reactions of these species with the oh radical that are considered in this work previous studies have reported the formation of the carboxyl radical cooh co2 pignatello et al 2006 buxton et al 1988 zechner and getoff 1974 neta et al 1969 rabani and stein 1962 2 hcooh oh cooh h2o k 1 4 108 m 1 s 1 3 hco2 oh co2 h2o k 2 6 109 m 1 s 1 at solution ph 3 co2 reacts to produce co2 either through electron transfer or by disproportionation fricke et al 1938 respectively 4 co2 o2 co2 o2 k 2 4 109 m 1 s 1 5 co2 co2 haq co2 hco2 k 6 5 108 m 1 s 1 while this conservative reaction set represents the mineralization of formic acid formate it is by no means a complete description of all the reactions that can occur for example the dimerization of the co2 radical proceeds via either a head to tail 90 or a head to head recombination of its two mesomeric forms flyunt et al 2001 head to tail dimerization produces a carbanion ococoo2 which rearranges to yield oxalate ooc coo thus generating a higher molecular weight species eq 6 alternately it may undergo protonation to form a mixed anhydride ococooh that ultimately decomposes to give co2 and formate leading toward mineralization eq 7 6 co2 coo ococoo2 ooc coo 7 co2 coo ococoo2 haq ococooh co2 hco2 head to head dimerization 10 directly yields the oxalate anion ooc coo 8 2 co2 ooc coo these reactions of ococoo2 account for the ph dependency of product formation for phs 3 oxalate is the major degradation product eq 6 keene et al 1965 neta et al 1969 while at phs 3 protonation and subsequent decomposition of the carbanion dominates eq 7 these reactions link the free radical induced chemistry of formic and oxalic acids and their respective conjugate bases in addition to ph the redox potential of the system controlled by the concentration of dissolved oxygen can also affect degradation unlike some other aop approaches the irradiation of water also produces strongly reducing radicals as well as the oh radical eq 1 the hydrated electron eaq eo 2 9 v buxton et al 1988 and the hydrogen atom h eo 2 3 v buxton et al 1988 are also capable of reacting with formic acid formate buxton et al 1988 9 hcooh eaq h2o cooh h2 oh k 1 4 108 m 1 s 1 10 hcooh h cooh h2 k 4 4 105 m 1 s 1 11 hco2 eaq h2o co2 h2 oh k 8 103 m 1 s 1 12 hco2 h co2 h2 k 2 1 108 m 1 s 1 however these reducing species are scavenged when dissolved oxygen is present limiting their contribution to formate degradation thus it is clear that the effectiveness of an aop will be significantly impacted by solution ph redox potential and also the presence of other solutes that act as radical scavengers notably the natural organic matter nom and carbonate species inevitably present in real world waters to optimize the effectiveness for mineralization it is necessary to develop a predictive quantitative kinetic computer model for all the possible chemical transformations occurring to date there is no complete kinetic computer model describing the mineralization of formic acid formate therefore here we report such a model using experimental results for the gamma radiation induced degradation of formic acid formate in conjunction with literature data irradiation experiments were performed under various conditions of ph and redox potential to evaluate the effects of hydronium ion concentration dissolved oxygen concentration and oh radical yield on mineralization we note that although the focus here is on the ultimate mineralization of organic contaminants for water treatment these reactions also occur in such disparate areas as nuclear fuel reprocessing mincher and mezyk 2009 the formation of interstellar organic species gopalsamy et al 2019 and in the photolysis of atmospheric aerosols

research nordion gammacell 220e 60co irradiator was used to irradiate samples over a series of absorbed doses at an average dose rate of 1 13 gy min 1 for formate samples and 0 90 gy min 1 for formic acid samples dose rates were determined by fricke dosimetry fricke and hart 1935 and subsequently corrected for 60co decay τ1 2 5 27 years for each of 13 sample holder positions samples were comprised of 4 0 ml of ph adjusted 1 5 or 9 0 through addition of hclo4 h2so4 or naoh respectively aqueous 1 0 mm sodium formate sealed in 20 ml crimp cap vials irradiated either as they were prepared sealed with an air headspace or sparged with specific gases for reasons discussed in section 3 to examine deaerated or highly oxidizing conditions samples were sparged inside an equilibrated environmental chamber with n2 or n2o respectively prior to irradiation initial dissolved oxygen concentrations were believed to be 10 μm for both these systems butler et al 1994 for aerated conditions samples were continually sparged during irradiation with tank compressed air regulated by a mass flow controller at 1 ml min 1 thus keeping the dissolved oxygen concentration at ambient air levels ca 250 μm irradiations run in sealed containers also had this initial oxygen level sample irradiations were run in quintuplicate post irradiation the ph of each sample was re measured with negligible difference found 2 3 high performance liquid chromatography hplc quantification of all carboxylic acids formic acid formate oxalic acid and oxalate was performed by hplc using a waters alliance e2695 separations

phase with a flow rate of 0 6 ml min 1 and a column temperature of 35 c the pda measurements were extracted from the 210 nm channel using retention times and peak heights compared to standards this afforded 1 percent relative standard deviation rsd for integrated curve areas and limits of detection of 0 04 mm for formate formic acid and 0 007 mm for oxalate oxalic acid 2 4 gas chromatography gc

constructed to provide a quantitative mechanistic description of the radiolytic degradation of formic acid formate under the variety of chemical conditions expected within an aop system in this model reactions are expressed as a series of coupled ordinary differential equations and solved using the facsimle numerical algorithm mcpa software 2020 primary water radiolysis yields and the water radiolysis chemical reaction set were sourced from buxton et al 1988 and elliot and bartels 2009 the chemical reaction compilation employed for modeling the chemistry of formic acid formate were obtained from published literature where experimental data were absent kinetic parameters were optimized using program fitting to the measured experimental concentration profiles of this study a complete reaction set for formic acid formate is given in supplementary data table s1 the associated data in brief table 9 a simple stagnant two film model whitman 1923 was implemented for gas partitioning between aqueous and gaseous phases for which standard henry s coefficients sander 1999 and temperature dependent diffusivity parameters cadogan et al 2014 kallikragas et al 2014 massman 1998 were used the interfacial area for mass transfer was optimized to provide the best fit to gc data 3 results and discussion 3 1 radiolytic degradation of formate hco2 at ph 9 0 to elucidate the radiolysis mechanism of formic acid the respective chemistries of this acid and its conjugate base pka 3 77 buxton et al 1988 must be resolved to this end sodium formate solutions were adjusted to either ph 1 5 or 9 0 ensuring the steady state predominance one of the species under a given set of conditions as most aop systems operate under neutral to alkaline conditions the ph 9 0 systems will be addressed first the gamma radiolysis of ph 9 0 sodium formate and subsequent ingrowth of oxalate in a variety of aqueous solutions is given in fig 1 for all four solution conditions it can be seen that the kinetic computer modeling predictions solid curves are in excellent agreement with experiment the deviation predicted in oxalate formation seen in fig 1 b for n2o sparged conditions highlights the limitations in the employed reaction set for oxalate radiolysis gordeev et al 2005 this chemistry is the subject of analogous experiments and calculations that specifically investigate aqueous radical induced oxalate degradation that are currently underway the mechanism for the degradation of formate is generally assumed to be primarily driven by reaction with the oh radical liberating the co2 radical as shown in eq 3 the fate of the co2 radical is one of the factors that determines the extent of mineralization and thus the effectiveness of an aop system if o2 is present fig 1 a sealed and air sparged the co2 radical is expected to be rapidly scavenged by o2 to yield co2 and the superoxide radical o2 as shown in eq 4 the co2 may then either diffuse out of solution or undergo hydration to form a variety of carbonate species depending upon ph in the absence of o2 fig 1 a n2 and n2o sparged the co2 radical may instead undergo dimerization as shown in eqs 6 and 8 possibly resulting in oxalate formation rather than mineralization in a continually air equilibrated aop system with a constant dissolved o2 concentration the air sparged conditions shown in fig 1 are applicable here the formate concentration degrades almost linearly with absorbed gamma dose affording a g value of 0 36 µm j 1 fig 1 a the fundamental processes responsible for these observations are highlighted by the calculated cumulative reaction pathway concentrations shown in fig 2 for formate and the co2 radical a cumulative reaction pathway concentration is the sum concentration of a single product produced by a given reaction this parameter tracks the relative contribution by a reaction to the total fate of a reactant since the o2 concentration is maintained at 0 25 mm the formate and co2 radical reducing reactions involving the eaq and h atom eqs 11 14 buxton et al 1988 are suppressed because they cannot compete with the diffusion limited scavenging reactions shown in eqs 15 and 16 13 co2 eaq h2o hco2 oh k 9 109 m 1 s 1 14 co2 h hco2 k 9 109 m 1 s 1 15 o2 eaq o2 k 1 9 1010 m 1 s 1 16 o2 h ho2 k 1 2 1010 m 1 s 1 thus formate degradation is predominantly driven by reaction with the oh radical fig 2 a the co2 radical is quantitatively consumed by dissolved oxygen eq 4 fig 2 b and mineralization is therefore expected under aerated conditions the corresponding formation of oxalate is inhibited as seen in fig 1 b at ph 9 0 the co2 resulting from eq 4 undergoes hydration to yield carbonate species this is consistent with the absence of co2 in the corresponding gc data given in fig 3 a for irradiated sealed conditions here we also see the production of h2 from the radiolysis of water eq 1 but no other gaseous products the n2 sparged data shown in fig 1 represents a deaerated anoxic system as with the air sparged system formate degrades almost linearly with absorbed dose affording a similar g value of 0 33 µm j 1 this is somewhat surprising considering the eaq and h atom are no longer being scavenged by o2 eqs 15 and 16 and thus would be expected to enhance the rate of formate degradation our model calculations fig 4 a show that both the oh radical and h atom contribute 81 and 18 to total formate degradation respectively under these irradiated sealed conditions however the additional degradation afforded by the h atom is apparently counterbalanced by reformation of formate through eq 13 under these ph 9 0 n2 sparged conditions co2 radical degradation occurs by 77 dimerization eqs 6 and 8 and 22 by reaction with the eaq eq 13 as shown in fig 4 b in the absence of o2 dimerization of the co2 radical under alkaline conditions eq 6 and 8 results in the formation of oxalate which grows in linearly with a g value of 0 1 µm j 1 as shown and successfully modeled in fig 1 b as the oh radical is the predominant species utilized by aop systems additives such as h2o2 are often added to enhance this radicals yield here n2o sparging was used to simulate this effect enhancing the yield of the oh radical through conversion of the eaq and h atom buxton et al 1988 czapski and peled 1968 17 n2o eaq n2 o k 9 1 109 m 1 s 1 18 n2o h n2 oh k 2 1 106 m 1 s 1 19 o h2o oh oh pka 11 84 mezyk 1996 as expected the rate of formate degradation was significantly enhanced due to n2o sparging affording a g value of 0 64 µm j 1 as seen in fig 1 a this is almost double that for the air and n2 sparged systems consistent with the expected doubling of the g value for the oh radical yield however it was found from our calculations fig 5 a that the increased rate of formate degradation is mainly due to formate reaction with the oxide radical anion o directly yielded by eqs 17 and 19 under alkaline conditions 20 hco2 o co2 oh k 1 0 109 m 1 s 1 the model optimized rate coefficient value for eq 20 is in very good agreement with the single experimental determination in the literature k 1 4 109 m 1 s 1 buxton 1969 although the o radical has a slightly slower rate coefficient than the oh radical with formate 2 2 5 1 109 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 this reaction is not slow enough to be neglected especially as investigated formate concentrations are in significant excess of all other o radical competitors consequently formate degradation occurs 62 by reaction with the oh radical eq 3 31 by reaction with the o radical eq 20 6 by reaction with the h atom and 1 by reaction with the carbonate radical co3 eq 21 as shown in fig 5 a 21 hco2 co3 hco3 co2 k 1 5 105 m 1 s 1 the h contribution reflects a combination of progressive radiolytic consumption of n2o and its corresponding rate coefficient being significantly slower than that for the eaq eqs 17 and 18 since sparging with n2o also displaces o2 the majority of the co2 radical 73 is converted into oxalate by addition reactions at high ph as shown in fig 1 b the remaining co2 radical is consumed by radiolytically produced o2 14 h2o2 9 eq 22 and hco3 4 eq 23 as shown in fig 5 b 22 co2 h2o2 co2 oh oh k 2 0 105 m 1 s 1 23 co2 hco3 co3 hco2 k 2 0 104 m 1 s 1 the model optimized rate coefficient value for eq 23 is again in very good agreement with previous literature values k 6 105 m 1 s 1 schwarz 1992 both h2o2 and hco3 accumulate in solution with absorbed dose through water radiolysis eq 1 and hydration of radiolytically produced co2 respectively the contribution from o2 eq 4 under these conditions arises from its production through the combination of eqs 24 and 25 24 ho2 oh o2 h2o 25 co3 o2 co3 2 o2 k 6 5 108 m 1 s 1 under these n2o sparged alkaline conditions 1 0 mm formate is completely consumed in less than 2 kgy fig 1 a resulting in the onset of radiolytic oxalate decomposition at that absorbed dose as also shown in fig 1 b fig 1 also shows data for an initially air equilibrated solution that was sealed and irradiated these conditions are of relevance for scenarios at later stages in aop water treatment where the irradiated system may become depleted of dissolved o2 due to the occurrence of radical reactions eqs 4 15 and 16 as can be seen in fig 1 a the behavior of formate mirrors that of the air sparged system until the concentration of o2 falls below a critical concentration 0 1 mm for effectively scavenging all of the eaq h and co2 radicals this manifests as an inflection point in the data in fig 1 a analysis of the corresponding calculated cumulative reaction pathways in fig 6 reveal that the sudden change in profile is a consequence of h2o2 accumulated from water radiolysis scavenging the now available eaq to yield additional oh radical buxton et al 1988 26 h2o2 eaq oh oh k 1 2 1010 m 1 s 1 this is demonstrated here by the spike in oh radical contribution to formate degradation in fig 6 a eq 3 and the simultaneous plateau region for the reaction of the co2 radical with h2o2 in fig 6 b eq 22 further enhancement of formate degradation with o2 depletion occurs by the reaction of formate with the now available h atom eq 12 these two processes lead to accelerated formate degradation and ultimately oxalate formation as shown in fig 1 b 3 2 radiolytic degradation of formic acid hcooh at ph 1 5 in acidic solutions the formic acid dissociation equilibrium pka 3 77 buxton et al 1988 is pushed to the left allowing for the radiation chemistry of formic acid to be probed the gamma radiolysis of a ph 1 5 solution of initially 1 0 mm sodium formate under the same set of solution conditions as above for ph 9 0 samples is given in fig 7 once again kinetic computer modeling predictions solid curves are in excellent agreement with experiment under all four solution conditions in the gas sparged systems formic acid again degrades almost linearly with increasing absorbed dose affording g values of 0 22 air sparged 0 27 n2 sparged and 0 39 n2o sparged µm j 1 these rates are slightly slower than the corresponding alkaline formate systems which is explained by the nearly factor of 20 slower rate coefficient for the oh radical reaction with formic acid 1 4 108 m 1 s 1 vs 2 6 109 m 1 s 1 for formate buxton et al 1988 interestingly sparging with n2 accelerates formic acid degradation relative to the corresponding air sparged system in contrast to the formate results for ph 9 0 the lower ph of this system results in a higher scavenging capacity for both pre solvated electrons epre and eaq because they are both rapidly scavenged by haq and converted to h atom pimblott and laverne 1998 27 e 110 fs e p r e 240 fs e a q 28 epre haq h k 2 18 1012 m 1 s 1 29 eaq haq h k 2 3 1010 m 1 s 1 this ensures inhibition of eaq reactions and enhancement of h atom processes preventing reformation of formate formic acid via the reaction of the co2 radical with the eaq eq 13 and promotes its decomposition due to the enhanced yield of h atom eqs 10 and 12 additionally under acidic conditions co2 is now available for reaction with h atom keene et al 1965 30 h co2 cooh k 1 106 m 1 s 1 decreasing the extent of reformation of formate formic acid through eqs 14 and 31 31 cooh h hcooh k 9 109 m 1 s 1 these ph effects are evident from our ph 1 5 n2 sparged calculations shown in fig 8 a wherein formic acid degradation occurs 59 by reaction with the oh radical eqs 2 and 3 and 41 by reaction with the h atom eqs 10 and 12 over double the h atom contribution when compared to the corresponding ph 9 0 calculations shown in fig 4 a further in fig 8 b the contribution of h atom to the reformation of formate formic acid eqs 14 and 31 is 70 less than reformation by eaq eq 13 shown in fig 4 b under all four acidic formic acid irradiation conditions no oxalic acid oxalate species were detected instead co2 was measured as shown in fig 3 b for the corresponding sealed system this was as expected because increased acidity not only drives carbonate equilibria toward co2 formation 32 co3 2 haq hco3 haq h2co3 co2 h2o it also promotes protonation of the head to tail co2 radical dimerization mixed anhydride product allowing for its decomposition to co2 as shown in eq 7 for the n2o sparged solutions the rate of formic acid degradation was again enhanced over that for air sparged solutions although to not as great a degree as seen at ph 9 0 this is attributed to the loss of eaq to acid scavenging eq 29 leaving only the h atom component available for conversion to the oh radical by n2o eq 18 for which the corresponding rate coefficient is 4 orders of magnitude slower than that with the eaq eq 17 consequently 1 of formic acid degradation occurs via reaction with the h atom the rest is with the oh radical eq 3 as acidity drives eq 19 to the left resulting in negligible contribution from the o radical fig 9 a finally it can also be seen in fig 7 that for the sealed system formic acid degradation initially mirrors that of the air sparged samples this is expected and consistent with behavior in the ph 9 0 samples in which o2 inhibits eaq and h reactions eqs 15 and 16 once again an inflection point is seen in the data once the dissolved o2 content has been sufficiently depleted by radiolytic processes at this point the data begins to mirror the n2o sparged solution consistent with the now available eaq being converted to h atom eq 29 thereby inhibiting formic acid reformation by eq 13 and promoting accelerated degradation through eqs 10 and 12 as shown in fig 10 4 conclusions since formic acid formate are the last stable chemical species produced immediately prior to complete mineralization of organic pollutants in aqueous solution their fates are of interest in the long term irradiation of all organic compounds in this study we report on the construction of a complete predicative quantitative computer kinetic model for the gamma radiolysis of formic acid and its conjugate base formate as a function of absorbed dose under both acidic ph 1 5 and alkaline ph 9 0 conditions for both carboxylic acid species radiation induced degradation is primarily driven by reaction with the oh radical with the extent of mineralization dictated by the fate of the co2 radical comparison of degradation rates and the fundamental reaction mechanisms for formic acid and formate radiolysis revealed the following i acidic conditions favored complete mineralization of formic acid through protonation and subsequent hydrolysis of the head to tail co2 radical dimerization mixed anhydride product ii alkaline conditions promoted the formation of oxalate iii strongly oxidizing conditions favored a faster degradation rate and iv dissolved o2 inhibits the rate of degradation by consuming the reducing products of water radiolysis overall acidic oxidizing conditions can be recommended for an effective aop process further the product oxalate formed under near neutral ph conditions is also expected to undergo radical induced degradation possibly re forming formate formic acid in this computer model we have focused on quantitatively establishing the ph dependent aqueous radical chemistry of formate formic acid degradation analogous experiments and calculations that specifically investigate radical induced oxalate degradation are presently

17517,nitrogen plays a central role in the sewer ecosystem and the bioconversion of nitrogen can significantly affect bioreactions in sewers however the mechanisms underlying the involvement of nitrogen associated pollutants in sewer ecosystems remain unknown in this study the effects of two typical nitrogen ratios organic inorganic nitrogen 7 3 group a and 3 7 group b on carbon nitrogen and sulfur bioconversions were investigated in a pilot sewer the distribution of amino acids such as proline glycine and methionine was significantly different between groups a and b and carbon associated communities based on 16s rrna gene copies were more prevalent in group a while sulfur and nitrogen associated communities were more prevalent in group b to explore the effect of nitrogen on microbial response mechanisms metagenomics based methods were used to investigate the roles of amino acids involved in carbon nitrogen and sulfur bioconversion in sewers proline glycine and tyrosine in group a promoted the expression of genes associated with cell membrane transport and increased the rate of protein synthesis which stimulated the enrichment of carbon associated communities the transmembrane transport of higher concentrations of alanine and methionine in group b was essential for cell metabolism and nutrient transport thereby enriching nitrogen and sulfur associated communities in this investigation insights into carbon nitrogen and sulfur bioconversions in sewer ecosystems were revealed significantly improving the understanding of the sewer ecosystem within a community context graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords urban sewer system nitrogen source ecological system functional bioconversion metabolization response 1 introduction the abundant pollutants in urban sewer systems serve as substrates for microbial communities hvitved jacobsen et al 2004 variations in the composition of pollutants can affect the structures and metabolic characteristics of microbial communities sun et al 2018 the main components of urban sewage are carbon nitrogen and sulfur lau et al 2006 czerwionka et al 2012 ai et al 2019 the biotransformation of carbon and sulfur associated pollutants can lead to the generation of methane and sulfide in addition to pipe corrosion all of which affect the stable operation of urban sewer systems jiang et al 2013 liu et al 2015 auguet et al 2015 previous studies into nitrogen chemistry have focused primarily on processes associated with nitrate or nitrite addition to mitigate the generation of methane and sulfide in sewer systems mohanakrishnan et al 2009 jiang et al 2009 liang et al 2016 but have rarely explored the transformation and effect of pre existing nitrogen pollutants in sewage on the operation of sewer systems due to the abundant protein in household sewage particularly kitchen sewage the domestic sewage in the initial segments of sewers contains the highest level of organic nitrogen sources 50 of total nitrogen tn browne and murphy 2013 li et al 2016 however in recent decades the scale of the urban environment has gradually increased and more industrial wastewater has been directed to urban sewer systems including livestock and tannery wastewater containing high concentrations of inorganic nitrogen mainly ammonia which makes up more than 80 of tn wang et al 2016 lei et al 2020 these additions have increased the inorganic nitrogen concentration of sewage in many industrialized cities pai et al 2013 therefore the proportions of organic and inorganic nitrogen in sewage are significantly different between cities that primarily discharge domestic sewage and cities that discharge domestic sewage plus a significant amount of industrial wastewater nitrogen sources especially amino acids are the core materials for synthesis and catabolism in microbial communities kuypers et al 2018 the proportions of organic nitrogen and inorganic nitrogen in sewage can significantly affect amino acid synthesis thereby affecting the synthesis and catabolism in the microbial communities higgins et al 2008 kuypers et al 2018 zou et al 2018 for example different proportions of organic and inorganic nitrogen can affect the conversion of glycine methionine and cysteine in sewage glycine can activate genes associated with cell membrane transport a phenomenon that is associated with carbon associated communities lei et al 2020 methionine and cysteine play an important role in the sulfur associated cycle and can induce the generation of sulfide higgins et al 2008 nazir et al 2018 therefore nitrogen transformation in the form of amino acid metabolism serves as the cornerstone of carbon and sulfur associated microbial communities and different nitrogen conditions in sewage may significantly affect undesirable processes such as sulfide generation and pipe corrosion in urban sewer systems however nitrogen transformation in sewer systems under different nitrogen conditions has been under investigated and the effects of the diverse compositions of nitrogen pollutants on the operation of sewer systems also need further investigation the aim of this study was to determine the effects of different nitrogen conditions higher concentrations of organic nitrogen or higher concentrations of inorganic nitrogen on the metabolism of dominant microbial communities such as fermentation bacteria fb hydrogen producing acetogen hpa methanogenic archaea ma and sulfate reducing bacteria srb sun et al 2014 jin et al 2018 and on the ecological system conversions in sewer systems two kinds of sewage nitrogen conditions group a and group b were established in a 1200 m pilot sewer system over a period of 150 days in the two experimental groups variations in the levels of amino acids were monitored and the distribution of carbon nitrogen and sulfur associated communities were identified using quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr and 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing to produce a conceptual sewer ecosystem model providing insights into vital movements in sewers the functional potential and metabolic pathways among carbon nitrogen and sulfur associated communities were further explored using metagenomics because of the pivotal role of nitrogen the interactions among carbon nitrogen and sulfur bioconversions in sewer ecosystems can be investigated thus this study can help to improve the theoretical basis of analysis and prediction for undesirable processes such as sulfide generation and pipe corrosion by revealing the pathways and mechanisms of nitrogen transformation in the sewer systems under different nitrogen conditions and enhance the understanding of the ecological systems within microbial communities in urban sewer systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 sewer system setup a simulated pilot sewer system with an effective length of 1200 m was built at the xi an no 5 wwtp in china the key operation parameters of a real urban sewer system are temperature dissolved oxygen pipe slope flow velocity and pipe diameter in this study an electric hot water faucet tcl tdr 30jb02 was used to control the inlet water temperature at 20 25 c to ensure a constant temperature inside the pipeline system the outside of the pipelines was covered with a sponge material 20 mm the dissolved oxygen do concentration was 0 3 0 05 mg l the force driving the sewage flow was gravity the slope of the pipeline was 5 and a flow of 0 6 m s could be maintained under these conditions a layer of light proof insulation material was wrapped around the pipe to simulate the dark environment of an actual sewer all of the parameters were very close to those of real sewers hvitved jacobsen et al 2004 to simulate long distance pollutant transformation in sewers the pipe diameter was reduced to take full advantage of the experiment site in order to ensure uniformity of flow between the pilot sewer and real sewers the inner walls of the pilot pipes were ground to achieve a roughness corresponding to that of real sewer pipes using a small diameter pipe inner wall grinding machine the device incorporates a telescopic 10 m long connecting rod a wire brush an electric drill chuck which can be connected to the grinding head and an impeller shaft the roughness was measured using a portable roughness measuring instrument marsurf m300c german the roughness ra value was 3 2 um consistent with previously reported measurements botros and shouman 2016 the synthetic sewage in this study was refreshed periodically for one day the pilot sewer system is shown in fig s1 2 2 change in nitrogen source conditions due to the high protein content of kitchen waste which can range between 11 and 28 of the dry weight the organic nitrogen in sewage can occupy 50 to 80 of tn in cities that mainly discharge domestic sewage browne and murphy 2013 li et al 2016 as the urban scale increases more industrial wastewater such as livestock and tannery wastewater containing a high concentration of inorganic nitrogen mainly ammonia nitrogen which occupies more than 80 of tn is collected into urban sewer systems wang et al 2016 lei et al 2020 therefore for cities that discharge domestic sewage and a large amount of industrial wastewater the inorganic nitrogen in sewage occupies more than 60 of the tn as described above there are two kinds of typical sewage one that contains a higher amount of organic nitrogen 50 to 80 of tn and one with a higher inorganic nitrogen content more than 60 of tn to explore the effects of different compositions of nitrogen source on carbon and sulfur associated bioconversions two rations of organic and inorganic sources of nitrogen 7 3 in group a and 3 7 in group b were selected for this study table s1 the other water quality characteristics of the two groups were identical table s2 for the wastewater sampling the samples were collected from inspection well of the pilot sewer system to detect the water quality 2 3 environmental factor analysis biofilm thickness ph do and oxidation reduction potential orp were tested using a microelectrode unisense denmark with a tip diameter of 10 µm the microelectrode platform contains two parts for testing and production the signals are collected by the host and automatically read by the computer during the measurement ultrapure water bubbled with n2 was used as a base liquid and a nylon mesh was sued to fix the biofilm the sampling times were at 5th day 30th day 60th day 75th day 90th day and 150th day of the experimental process 2 4 amino acids detection the water samples were subjected to derivatization by phenyl isothiocyanate pitc the sample was uniformly mixed and allowed to stand at room temperature for one hour subsequently 800 μl of n hexane was added and the mixture was centrifuged for five minutes at a speed of 10 000 r min to absorb the lower layer the solution was extracted twice with n hexane and filtered through a 0 45 μm filter after the pre treatment of samples high performance liquid chromatography lc 10a japan was used the column was hypersil bds c18 250 mm 4 5 mm 5 μm the mobile phase a was a 50 mmol l sodium acetate solution and the mobile phase b a mixture of methanol acetonitrile and aqueous solution 30 50 20 the linear gradient elution procedures were as follows 0 min 0 b 6 5 min 0 b 7 min 10 b 8 min 12 b 9 min 13 b 10 min 13

the detection wavelength was 254 nm the injection volume was 5 μl furst et al 1990 the sampling time was at 150th day of the experimental process 2 5 biofilm sampling and thickness detection for cultivating biofilms strip shaped glasses 3 0 m long were placed inside the pipes of the pilot sewer two slipknots at the end of the pipe could be untied to take out the glasses and when sampling an approximately 30 cm section of the strip shaped glasses was cut off using a sterile glass cutter and placed into a disposable culture dish this operation avoids destruction of the structure of biofilms allowing the thickness of a biofilm to be analysed using microelectrodes unisense denmark the sampling time was at 150th day of the experimental process 2 6 characterization of the microbial community 2 6 1 dna extraction to identify the characteristics of microbial communities 22 biofilm samples were collected sixteen samples were subjected to 16s rrna gene detection and divided into two groups a and b the other six samples were subjected to metagenomic detection and divided into two groups a and b genomic dna was extracted from the samples using the ctab sds method according to the manufacturer s instructions dna concentration and purity were determined using micro spectrophotometry finally the sample was used for illumina high throughput sequencing hts 2 6 2 high throughput sequencing high throughput gene sequencing was used to identify differences in the relative abundance of hundreds of different types of bacteria eukaryotes and archaea these samples were sent to the novogene institute beijing china for high throughput sequencing illumina usa on the hiseq 2000 platform metagenomic sequencing was performed using illumina pe150 2 6 3 quantitative polymerase chain reaction quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays were performed using the applied biosystems 7500 qpcr system applied biosystems forster city ca and each test was repeated three times the

bioinformatics analysis quality calibration of raw sequence data was performed using the qiime software the label and primers were removed to form reads and the reads were clustered into operational taxonomic units otus based on 97 similarity using uclust microbial diversity and abundance of different microorganisms in samples was determined by otu analysis the evaluation of alpha diversity was based mainly on chao1 the shannon index and good s coverage microbial community richness was estimated using chao1 ace and diversity was evaluated based on the simpson shannon index beta diversity and principal component analysis pca were used to assess the differences in microbial communities in the samples 3 results and discussion 3 1 variation of amino acids under different nitrogen conditions along the sewer in this study the environmental factors ph do and orp and thickness of biofilms in group a and b tended to be stable by the 75th day fig s2 4 which was similar to previous study jin et al 2018 in addition our previous study has showed that the structures of microbial communities in sewer biofilms tended to be stable by the 90th day shi et al 2020 therefore the sampling time was at the 150th day in this study to ensure the complete stability of biofilms however the forms of biofilms in group a and b were different at maturity the thickness of biofilms in group a was significantly greater than that in group b along the sewer fig 1 a possibly due to the different characteristics of microbial reproduction in the two groups to explore this hypothesis the nitrogen associated pollutants were investigated along the sewer as shown in fig 1b ammonia nh4 n in both experimental groups gradually increased possibly due to the preferential utilization of organic proteins by the microorganisms in sewage which were then hydrolysed to nh4 n apelo et al 2014 the concentration of nitrate no3 n showed a downward trend and almost disappeared after 400 m fig 1b the variation of inorganic n in the two groups was similar as found by previous research showing low strength of inorganic n transformation in sewers shi et al 2018 the distributions of dominant amino acids involved in protein synthesis were determined fig 1c d amino acid compositions were significantly different between the two groups there were 16 different amino acids in group a but only 13 in group b the specific amino acids in group a included proline glycine and tyrosine in group b alanine was unique in addition the abundances of coexisting dominant amino acids in the two groups were significantly different the abundances of methionine in group a and b were 32 67 and 66 24 respectively and the abundances of threonine in group a and b were 29 86 and 6 50 respectively table s3 thus it can be concluded that changes in nitrogen source conditions can lead to different distributions of amino acids in the sewer it should be noted that although the conditions of carbon sources in group a and b were the same the variations of micromolecular carbon pollutants such as ethanol lactic acid formic acid and acetic acid in group a and b showed a significant difference as shown in figure s5 higher concentrations of micromolecular carbon pollutants were detected in group a transformations of carbon pollutants are the dominant bioreactions in sewer system and the different variation characteristics of micromolecular carbon pollutants in this study indicated that different nitrogen source condition could affect the processes of pollutant transformation in sewer systems previous study has demonstrated that the distribution of substrates and microbial communities had a covariation relationship and the dominant bioreactions varied along the sewer pipelines jin et al 2018 thus the variation of amino acids between group a and b could also affect the metabolic processes of microorganism in sewers 3 2 characteristics of functional microorganism distribution under different nitrogen conditions 3 2 1 overview of microbial community structures in groups a and b as seen in table s4 the peak values of the shannon indexes were 8 58 and 8 11 in groups a and b respectively indicating that the diversity of microbial communities was higher in group a than in group b in the principal component analysis pca plots the beta diversity showed that the compositions of microbial communities were also significantly different between groups a and b fig 2 this observation indicates that the nitrogen source affected the overall reproduction of the microbial communities to determine the effect of the nitrogen source on the distribution of microbial communities the sequences of biofilm samples were classified using 16s rrna gene sequencing the dominant phyla in group a were proteobacteria firmicutes and bacteroidetes accounting for 33 56 20 48 and 17 57 respectively proteobacteria chloroflexi and bacteroidetes accounted for 41 88 13 14 and 9 37 respectively in group b fig s6 proteobacteria is the major phylum associated with the hydrolysis and acidification during sludge fermentation liu et al 2014 this phylum has also been shown to play an important role in sulfur degradation itavaara et al 2016 therefore the differences in abundance of this phylum suggested that the carbon and sulfur associated bioconversions might be different between group a and b members of bacteroidetes and firmicutes can hydrolyse proteins in anaerobic environments xue et al 2016 indicating that the nitrogen associated bioconversion in groups a and b might also be affected by the different nitrogen sources in sewage 3 2 2 changes in carbon nitrogen and sulfur associated microbial communities in groups a and b to further determine the distributions of carbon nitrogen and sulfur associated microbial communities in groups a and b qpcr and sequencing were utilized based on the dominant functions in the sewer the carbon nitrogen and sulfur associated microbial communities were classified as total bacteria tb hpa and ma carbon associated communities dnb and aob nitrogen associated communities and srb sulfur associated communities as shown in fig 3 a the 16s rrna gene copy concentrations of tb in group a were higher than those in group b along the sewer and the peak value of the 16s rrna gene copy concentration of tb in group a was 2 84 1013 copies ml while it was only 6 24 1012 copies ml in group b the distribution characteristics of hpa and ma were similar to those of tb fig 3b c and the peak values of these functional communities in group a were significantly higher than those in group b in addition the relative abundances of carbon associated genus which promoted carbon degradation and methane generation were also higher in group a than those in group b fig 3 g and fig s7 these results indicated that the higher concentration of organic nitrogen in group a might stimulate the reproduction of the bacteria and provide suitable conditions for the generation of acetic acid and thus enhance methane emissions in the sewer as shown in fig 3d although the 16s rrna gene copy concentrations of srb were relatively similar in groups a and b they still showed a consistent trend of differential concentrations along the sewer the concentrations of srb in group a were lower than those in group b along the sewer and the peak value of srb concentration in group a was 4 88 107 copies ml and 6 31 107 copies ml in group b the sequencing results also verified that the dominant srb abundances of desulfomicrobium sulfurovum and desulfovibrio in group b were higher than those in group a fig 3 g and fig s7 indicating that group b had a greater capacity for promoting sulfate reduction the 16s rrna gene copy concentrations of dnb and aob were relatively low along the sewer fig 3e f indicating that the potential for transformation of inorganic nitrogen was weak as demonstrated in previous study jin et al 2018 however it should be noted that the concentrations of dnb and aob were higher in group b than in group a and the enrichment of nitrogen associated communities such as thiomonas might be the reason for this phenomenon fig 3 g and fig s7 thus although the strength of inorganic nitrogen transformation was low the higher concentration of inorganic nitrogen in sewage group b could also have potential to promote the ammoxidation and denitrification processes in fact the nitrogen source in the sewage was the only variation between groups a and b and thus the different characteristics of carbon nitrogen and sulfur associated communities in group a and b must be induced by the nitrogen especially the amino acids participating in the reproduction and metabolism of these communities the mechanism of these processes needed to be further revealed 3 3 analysis of functional gene classifications and metabolic pathways under different nitrogen conditions in sewers 3 3 1 functional classification of genes in groups a and b as described above the results of qpcr showed the potential of dominant carbon nitrogen and sulfur associated communities under different nitrogen conditions there were many other metabolic functions supporting these processes constituting the carbon nitrogen and sulfur bioconversions in the sewer thompson et al 2019 the use of metagenomic sequencing to classify gene functions has proven to be reliable for revealing the characteristics of functional genes in diverse metabolisms simon and daniel 2011 each sample and mixed assembly of scaftigs 500 bp were used to predict open reading frames with metagenemark oh et al 2014 and the gene catalogue unigenes that was ultimately used for subsequent analysis was obtained through a series of analyses methane metabolism fatty acid metabolism and fatty acid degradation were the dominant annotations for carbon metabolism fig 4 the numbers of functional category genes were higher in group a while the numbers of functional category genes for nitrogen and sulfur metabolisms were higher in group b in line with the qpcr results the amino acid biosynthesis genes comprised the highest proportion and the numbers of genes in the functional categories of amino acid biosynthesis and dna replication were more abundant in group a that original nitrogen pollutants were assimilated by sewer microbial communities for reproduction and the type of the nitrogen pollutant affected the expression of carbon nitrogen and sulfur bioconversions in the sewers 3 3 2 metabolic pathways of carbon nitrogen and sulfur in groups a and b by metagenome to further explore the matrix utilization and metabolic characteristics of carbon nitrogen and sulfur in biofilms in the sewer system a metagenomic approach was utilized to determine the metabolic pathways of the biochemical reactions fig 5 shows the results of the annotation of key genes and enzymes in carbon nitrogen and sulfur metabolic processes using the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg pathway database after metagenomic detection yu and zhang 2012 as shown in fig 5a there were two representative pathways for the carbon cycle glucose and methane metabolism and we also found that majority of the genes coding for enzymes such as 2 7 1 40 pyruvate kinase and 1 2 7 4 anaerobic carbon monoxide dehydrogenase catalytic subunit were higher in group a indicating higher expression of the key genes in group a glycine and aspartic acid were involved in methane and glucose metabolism respectively fig 5a which could support carbon associated bioconversions in sewers the distribution of amino acids in fig 1 indicates that group a was enriched in glycine and aspartic acid and that higher concentrations of organic nitrogen sources group a could induce the generation of glycine and aspartic acid and the enrichment of these amino acids could serve as the dominant driver of the strong carbon associated bioconversion in group a although nitrification and denitrification genes were observed in both groups table s5 a relatively small number of genes was associated with nitrification while the numbers of denitrification genes differed the numbers of genes coding for 1 7 2 1 nitrite reductase and 1 7 2 5 nitric oxide reductase in group b were higher fig 5b indicating a higher denitrification capacity in group b a finding which was also supported by the qpcr results of dnb as shown in fig 5c sulfate reduction appeared to be the dominant process of sulfur metabolism the metagenomic results showed that the numbers of genes coding for enzyme such as 1 8 99 2 adenylyl sulfate reductase and 2 5 1 47 cysteine synthase were higher in group b fig 5c demonstrating that group b had a higher sulfur cycle capacity we found that serine cysteine and methionine played an important role in the sulfur cycle and the concentrations of these amino acids especially methionine were significantly higher in group b fig 1 thus it could be concluded that an environment with a high proportion of inorganic nitrogen could promote the generation of methionine serine and cysteine and then stimulate sulfur associated bioconversion in sewers 3 4 ecological systems involving carbon nitrogen and sulfur bioconversions under different nitrogen conditions based on the analysis of the distribution of amino acids microbial community responses and the activity of metabolic pathways under different nitrogen conditions in the sewer it could be concluded that nitrogen involved in the bioconversions could significantly affect pollutant transformation the biochemical reactions were not isolated in the sewers but formed an interactive ecosystem with the nitrogen source as its core to improve the understanding of the sewer ecosystem the mechanisms of vital movements in groups a and b were explored using metagenomics as shown in fig 6 proline can improve the cell membrane and enhance the stability of the membrane structure in biofilms slabbert and krüger 2014 this improvement is conducive to the growth of biofilms and produces a more abundant microbial community structure the principal function of glycine is as a precursor to the formation of proteins and glycine processing can modify the rate of protein synthesis lei et al 2020 tyrosine phosphorylation has a role in signal transduction and enzyme activity regulation which promotes the formation of genes nisa et al 2017 proline glycine and tyrosine were specific to group a and the movements mentioned above could stimulate the reproduction of microbial communities and the consumption of carbon sources diversity in microbial communities was higher in group a and carbon associated bioconversions could be more easily achieved in group a the presence of alanine in group b also induced unique characteristics in the ecosystem alanine can promote the activity of microorganisms in nitrogen cycling through a cracking function zagorski and sehested 1998 the higher concentration of serine cysteine and methionine in group b promoted the sulfur cycling in the sewers and the intermediate product oxaloacetate was involved in the amino acid synthesis leading to the generation of sulfur associated communities this study investigated the variations in amino acids characteristics of microorganisms metabolic pathways and changes in ecological systems under different nitrogen conditions in a sewer system the results showed that due to a higher organic nitrogen content glycine and aspartic were enriched in group a and induced stronger expression of methane metabolism carbon associated bioconversion than was apparent in group b due to higher inorganic nitrogen content serine cysteine and methionine were enriched in group b which promoted the sulfur cycle and generated higher levels of sulfide this biological information was also demonstrated by the detection of sulfide and methane along the sewer system the higher methane concentration was detected in group a and the higher sulfide concentration was detected in group b nitrogen composition in the sewage changed the functioning of the sewer ecosystem and therefore could affect undesirable processes such as sulfide and methane generation and pipe corrosion in urban sewer systems due to the importance of nitrogen substrates the detection of the nitrogen composition in sewage can serve as the basis for the analysis and prediction of undesirable processes in urban sewer systems it should be noted that to achieve more detailed ecosystem conversion in sewer systems under different nitrogen conditions the substrate correlations among carbon nitrogen and sulfur metabolism cycles and the gene correlation among those functional communities should be explored under more elaborate nitrogen conditions through batch tests in the future 4 conclusions based on a 1200 m pilot experimental sewer system the interactions of carbon nitrogen and sulfur bioconversions in the ecosystem of sewers were investigated in this study the main findings are as follows 1 the dominant amino acids in group a were methionine and threonine accounting for 32 67 and 29 86 respectively while methionine and aspartic acid were dominant in group b accounting for 66 24 and 8 98 respectively the different amino acid distributions in group a and b were the basis of the changes in sewer ecosystems under two typical nitrogen conditions 2 based on qpcr results the abundance of hpa and ma carbon associated communities was higher in group a while those of aob dnb and srb nitrogen and sulfur associated communities were higher in group b the differences in structure between group a and b indicated that dominant functions varied 3 metagenomic analysis indicated that due to the different characteristics of amino acid distribution the strength of carbon bioconversion was higher in group a while the strengths of nitrogen and sulfur bioconversion were higher in group b therefore the differences in nitrogen composition in sewage could affect undesirable processes such as sulfide and methane generation in urban sewer systems 4 we investigated the ecosystems in sewers by analysing the annotation of key genes and enzymes involved in the nitrogen cycle our results suggest that nitrogen bioconversion should not be overlooked in sewers and must be a core issue in studies on sewage

17517,nitrogen plays a central role in the sewer ecosystem and the bioconversion of nitrogen can significantly affect bioreactions in sewers however the mechanisms underlying the involvement of nitrogen associated pollutants in sewer ecosystems remain unknown in this study the effects of two typical nitrogen ratios organic inorganic nitrogen 7 3 group a and 3 7 group b on carbon nitrogen and sulfur bioconversions were investigated in a pilot sewer the distribution of amino acids such as proline glycine and methionine was significantly different between groups a and b and carbon associated communities based on 16s rrna gene copies were more prevalent in group a while sulfur and nitrogen associated communities were more prevalent in group b to explore the effect of nitrogen on microbial response mechanisms metagenomics based methods were used to investigate the roles of amino acids involved in carbon nitrogen and sulfur bioconversion in sewers proline glycine and tyrosine in group a promoted the expression of genes associated with cell membrane transport and increased the rate of protein synthesis which stimulated the enrichment of carbon associated communities the transmembrane transport of higher concentrations of alanine and methionine in group b was essential for cell metabolism and nutrient transport thereby enriching nitrogen and sulfur associated communities in this investigation insights into carbon nitrogen and sulfur bioconversions in sewer ecosystems were revealed significantly improving the understanding of the sewer ecosystem within a community context

urban sewer systems serve as substrates for microbial communities hvitved jacobsen et al 2004 variations in the composition of pollutants can affect the structures and metabolic characteristics of microbial communities sun et al 2018 the main components of urban sewage are carbon nitrogen and sulfur lau et al 2006 czerwionka et al 2012 ai et al 2019 the biotransformation of carbon and sulfur associated pollutants can lead to the generation of methane and sulfide in addition to pipe corrosion all of which affect the stable operation of urban sewer systems jiang et al 2013 liu et al 2015 auguet et al 2015 previous studies into nitrogen chemistry have focused primarily on processes associated with nitrate or nitrite addition to mitigate the generation of methane and sulfide in sewer systems mohanakrishnan et al 2009 jiang et al 2009 liang et al 2016 but have rarely explored the transformation and effect of pre existing nitrogen pollutants in sewage on the operation of sewer systems due to the abundant protein in household sewage particularly kitchen sewage the domestic sewage in the initial segments of sewers contains the highest level of organic nitrogen sources 50 of total nitrogen tn browne and murphy 2013 li et al 2016 however in recent decades the scale of the urban environment has gradually increased and more industrial wastewater has been directed to urban sewer systems including livestock and tannery wastewater containing high concentrations of inorganic nitrogen mainly ammonia which makes up more than 80 of tn wang et al 2016 lei et al 2020 these additions have increased the inorganic nitrogen concentration of sewage in many industrialized cities pai et al 2013 therefore the proportions of organic and inorganic nitrogen in sewage are significantly different between cities that primarily discharge domestic sewage and cities that discharge domestic sewage plus a significant amount of industrial wastewater nitrogen sources especially amino acids are the core materials for synthesis and catabolism in microbial communities kuypers et al 2018 the proportions of organic nitrogen and inorganic nitrogen in sewage can significantly affect amino acid synthesis thereby affecting the synthesis and catabolism in the microbial communities higgins et al 2008 kuypers et al 2018 zou et al 2018 for example different proportions of organic and inorganic nitrogen can affect the conversion of glycine methionine and cysteine in sewage glycine can activate genes associated with cell membrane transport a phenomenon that is associated with carbon associated communities lei et al 2020 methionine and cysteine play an important role in the sulfur associated cycle and can induce the generation of sulfide higgins et al 2008 nazir et al 2018 therefore nitrogen transformation in the form of amino acid metabolism serves as the cornerstone of carbon and sulfur associated microbial communities and different nitrogen conditions in sewage may significantly affect undesirable processes such as sulfide generation and pipe corrosion in urban sewer systems however nitrogen transformation in sewer systems under different nitrogen conditions has been under investigated and the effects of the diverse compositions of nitrogen pollutants on the operation of sewer systems also need further investigation the aim of this study was to determine the effects of different nitrogen conditions higher concentrations of organic nitrogen or higher concentrations of inorganic nitrogen on the metabolism of dominant microbial communities such as fermentation bacteria fb hydrogen producing acetogen hpa methanogenic archaea ma and sulfate reducing bacteria srb sun et al 2014 jin et al 2018 and on the ecological system conversions in sewer systems two kinds of sewage nitrogen conditions group a and group b were established in a 1200 m pilot sewer system over a period of 150 days in the two experimental groups variations in the levels of amino acids were monitored and the distribution of carbon nitrogen and sulfur associated communities were identified using quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr and 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing to produce a conceptual sewer ecosystem model providing insights into vital movements in sewers the functional potential and metabolic pathways among carbon nitrogen and sulfur associated communities were further explored using metagenomics because of the pivotal role of nitrogen the interactions among carbon nitrogen and sulfur bioconversions in sewer ecosystems can be investigated thus this study can help to improve the theoretical basis of analysis and prediction for undesirable processes such as sulfide generation and pipe corrosion by revealing the pathways and mechanisms of nitrogen transformation in the sewer systems under different nitrogen conditions and enhance the understanding of the ecological systems within microbial communities in urban sewer systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 sewer system setup a simulated pilot sewer system with an effective length of 1200 m was built at the xi an no 5 wwtp in china the key operation parameters of a real urban sewer system are temperature dissolved oxygen pipe slope flow velocity and pipe diameter in this study an electric hot water faucet tcl tdr 30jb02 was used to control the inlet water temperature at 20 25 c to ensure a constant temperature inside the pipeline system the outside of the pipelines was covered with a sponge material 20 mm the dissolved oxygen do concentration was 0 3 0 05 mg l the force driving the sewage flow was gravity the slope of the pipeline was 5 and a flow of 0 6 m s could be maintained under these conditions a layer of light proof insulation material was wrapped around the pipe to simulate the dark environment of an actual sewer all of the parameters were very close to those of real sewers hvitved jacobsen et al 2004 to simulate long distance pollutant transformation in sewers the pipe diameter was reduced to take full advantage of the experiment site in order to ensure uniformity of flow between the pilot sewer and real sewers the inner walls of the pilot pipes were ground to achieve a roughness corresponding to that of real sewer pipes using a small diameter pipe inner wall grinding machine the device incorporates a telescopic 10 m long connecting rod a wire brush an electric drill chuck which can be connected to the grinding head and an impeller shaft the roughness was measured using a portable roughness measuring instrument marsurf m300c german the roughness ra value was 3 2 um consistent with previously reported measurements botros and shouman 2016 the synthetic sewage in this study was refreshed periodically for one day the pilot sewer system is shown in fig s1 2 2 change in nitrogen source conditions due to the high protein content of kitchen waste which can range between 11 and 28 of the dry weight the organic nitrogen in sewage can occupy 50 to 80 of tn in cities that mainly discharge domestic sewage browne and murphy 2013 li et al 2016 as the urban scale increases more industrial wastewater such as livestock and tannery wastewater containing a high concentration of inorganic nitrogen mainly ammonia nitrogen which occupies more than 80 of tn is collected into urban sewer systems wang et al 2016 lei et al 2020 therefore for cities that discharge domestic sewage and a large amount of industrial wastewater the inorganic nitrogen in sewage occupies more than 60 of the tn as described above there are two kinds of typical sewage one that contains a higher amount of organic nitrogen 50 to 80 of tn and one with a higher inorganic nitrogen content more than 60 of tn to explore the effects of different compositions of nitrogen source on carbon and sulfur associated bioconversions two rations of organic and inorganic sources of nitrogen 7 3 in group a and 3 7 in group b were selected for this study table s1 the other water quality characteristics of the two groups were identical table s2 for the wastewater sampling the samples were collected from inspection well of the pilot sewer system to detect the water quality 2 3 environmental factor analysis biofilm thickness ph do and oxidation reduction potential orp were tested using a microelectrode unisense denmark with a tip diameter of 10 µm the microelectrode platform contains two parts for testing and production the signals are collected by the host and automatically read by the computer during the measurement ultrapure water bubbled with n2 was used as a base liquid and a nylon mesh was sued to fix the biofilm the sampling times were at 5th day 30th day 60th day 75th day 90th day and 150th day of the experimental process 2 4 amino acids detection the water samples were subjected to derivatization by phenyl isothiocyanate pitc the sample was uniformly mixed and allowed to stand at room temperature for one hour subsequently 800 μl of n hexane was added and the mixture was centrifuged for five minutes at a speed of 10 000 r min to absorb the lower layer the solution was extracted twice with n hexane and filtered through a 0 45 μm filter after the pre treatment of samples high performance liquid chromatography lc 10a japan was used the column was hypersil bds c18 250 mm 4 5 mm 5 μm the mobile phase a was a 50 mmol l sodium acetate solution and the mobile phase b a mixture of methanol acetonitrile and aqueous solution 30 50 20 the linear gradient elution procedures were as follows 0 min 0 b 6 5 min 0 b 7 min 10 b 8 min 12 b 9 min 13 b 10 min 13

the detection wavelength was 254 nm the injection volume was 5 μl furst et al 1990 the sampling time was at 150th day of the experimental process 2 5 biofilm sampling and thickness detection for cultivating biofilms strip shaped glasses 3 0 m long were placed inside the pipes of the pilot sewer two slipknots at the end of the pipe could be untied to take out the glasses and when sampling an approximately 30 cm section of the strip shaped glasses was cut off using a sterile glass cutter and placed into a disposable culture dish this operation avoids destruction of the structure of biofilms allowing the thickness of a biofilm to be analysed using microelectrodes unisense denmark the sampling time was at 150th day of the experimental process 2 6 characterization of the microbial community 2 6 1 dna extraction to identify the characteristics of microbial communities 22 biofilm samples were collected sixteen samples were subjected to 16s rrna gene detection and divided into two groups a and b the other six samples were subjected to metagenomic detection and divided into two groups a and b genomic dna was extracted from the samples using the ctab sds method according to the manufacturer s instructions dna concentration and purity were determined using micro spectrophotometry finally the sample was used for illumina high throughput sequencing hts 2 6 2 high throughput sequencing high throughput gene sequencing was used to identify differences in the relative abundance of hundreds of different types of bacteria eukaryotes and archaea these samples were sent to the novogene institute beijing china for high throughput sequencing illumina usa on the hiseq 2000 platform metagenomic sequencing was performed using illumina pe150 2 6 3 quantitative polymerase chain reaction quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays were performed using the applied biosystems 7500 qpcr system applied biosystems forster city ca and each test was repeated three times the forward and reverse primers for amplifying the v3 and v5 regions of the 16s rrna gene in the different strains were dnb f atyggcggvcayggcga and r gcctcgatcagrttrtggtt kim et al 2011 hpa f

bioinformatics analysis quality calibration of raw sequence data was performed using the qiime software the label and primers were removed to form reads and the reads were clustered into operational taxonomic units otus based on 97 similarity using uclust microbial diversity and abundance of different microorganisms in samples was determined by otu analysis the evaluation of alpha diversity was based mainly on chao1 the shannon index and good s coverage microbial community richness was estimated using chao1 ace and diversity was evaluated based on the simpson shannon index beta diversity and principal component analysis pca were used to assess the differences in microbial communities in the samples 3 results and discussion 3 1 variation of amino acids under different nitrogen conditions along the sewer in this study the environmental factors ph do and orp and thickness of biofilms in group a and b tended to be stable by the 75th day fig s2 4 which was similar to previous study jin et al 2018 in addition our previous study has showed that the structures of microbial communities in sewer biofilms tended to be stable by the 90th day shi et al 2020 therefore the sampling time was at the 150th day in this study to ensure the complete stability of biofilms however the forms of biofilms in group a and b were different at maturity the thickness of biofilms in group a was significantly greater than that in group b along the sewer fig 1 a possibly due to the different characteristics of microbial reproduction in the two groups to explore this hypothesis the nitrogen associated pollutants were investigated along the sewer as shown in fig 1b ammonia nh4 n in both experimental groups gradually increased possibly due to the preferential utilization of organic proteins by the microorganisms in sewage which were then hydrolysed to nh4 n apelo et al 2014 the concentration of nitrate no3 n showed a downward trend and almost disappeared after 400 m fig 1b the variation of inorganic n in the two groups was similar as found by previous research showing low strength of inorganic n transformation in sewers shi et al 2018 the distributions of dominant amino acids involved in protein synthesis were determined fig 1c d amino acid compositions were significantly different between the two groups there were 16 different amino acids in group a but only 13 in group b the specific amino acids in group a included proline glycine and tyrosine in group b alanine was unique in addition the abundances of coexisting dominant amino acids in the two groups were significantly different the abundances of methionine in group a and b were 32 67 and 66 24 respectively and the abundances of threonine in group a and b were 29 86 and 6 50 respectively table s3 thus it can be concluded that changes in nitrogen source conditions can lead to different distributions of amino acids in the sewer it should be noted that although the conditions of carbon sources in group a and b were the same the variations of micromolecular carbon pollutants such as ethanol lactic acid formic acid and acetic acid in group a and b showed a significant difference as shown in figure s5 higher concentrations of micromolecular carbon pollutants were detected in group a transformations of carbon pollutants are the dominant bioreactions in sewer system and the different variation characteristics of micromolecular carbon pollutants in this study indicated that different nitrogen source condition could affect the processes of pollutant transformation in sewer systems previous study has demonstrated that the distribution of substrates and microbial communities had a covariation relationship and the dominant bioreactions varied along the sewer pipelines jin et al 2018 thus the variation of amino acids between group a and b could also affect the metabolic processes of microorganism in sewers 3 2 characteristics of functional microorganism distribution under different nitrogen conditions 3 2 1 overview of microbial community structures in groups a and b as seen in table s4 the peak values of the shannon indexes were 8 58 and 8 11 in groups a and b respectively indicating that the diversity of microbial communities was higher in group a than in group b in the principal component analysis pca plots the beta diversity showed that the compositions of microbial communities were also significantly different between groups a and b fig 2 this observation indicates that the nitrogen source affected the overall reproduction of the microbial communities to determine the effect of the nitrogen source on the distribution of microbial communities the sequences of biofilm samples were classified using 16s rrna gene sequencing the dominant phyla in group a were proteobacteria firmicutes and bacteroidetes accounting for 33 56 20 48 and 17 57 respectively proteobacteria chloroflexi and bacteroidetes accounted for 41 88 13 14 and 9 37 respectively in group b fig s6 proteobacteria is the major phylum associated with the hydrolysis and acidification during sludge fermentation liu et al 2014 this phylum has also been shown to play an important role in sulfur degradation itavaara et al 2016 therefore the differences in abundance of this phylum suggested that the carbon and sulfur associated bioconversions might be different between group a and b members of bacteroidetes and firmicutes can hydrolyse proteins in anaerobic environments xue et al 2016 indicating that the nitrogen associated bioconversion in groups a and b might also be affected by the different nitrogen sources in sewage 3 2 2 changes in carbon nitrogen and sulfur associated microbial communities in groups a and b to further determine the distributions of carbon nitrogen and sulfur associated microbial communities in groups a and b qpcr and sequencing were utilized based on the dominant functions in the sewer the carbon nitrogen and sulfur associated microbial communities were classified as total bacteria tb hpa and ma carbon associated communities dnb and aob nitrogen associated communities and srb sulfur associated communities as shown in fig 3 a the 16s rrna gene copy concentrations of tb in group a were higher than those in group b along the sewer and the peak value of the 16s rrna gene copy concentration of tb in group a was 2 84 1013 copies ml while it was only 6 24 1012 copies ml in group b the distribution characteristics of hpa and ma were similar to those of tb fig 3b c and the peak values of these functional communities in group a were significantly higher than those in group b in addition the relative abundances of carbon associated genus which promoted carbon degradation and methane generation were also higher in group a than those in group b fig 3 g and fig s7 these results indicated that the higher concentration of organic nitrogen in group a might stimulate the reproduction of the bacteria and provide suitable conditions for the generation of acetic acid and thus enhance methane emissions in the sewer as shown in fig 3d although the 16s rrna gene copy concentrations of srb were relatively similar in groups a and b they still showed a consistent trend of differential concentrations along the sewer the concentrations of srb in group a were lower than those in group b along the sewer and the peak value of srb concentration in group a was 4 88 107 copies ml and 6 31 107 copies ml in group b the sequencing results also verified that the dominant srb abundances of desulfomicrobium sulfurovum and desulfovibrio in group b were higher than those in group a fig 3 g and fig s7 indicating that group b had a greater capacity for promoting sulfate reduction the 16s rrna gene copy concentrations of dnb and aob were relatively low along the sewer fig 3e f indicating that the potential for transformation of inorganic nitrogen was weak as demonstrated in previous study jin et al 2018 however it should be noted that the concentrations of dnb and aob were higher in group b than in group a and the enrichment of nitrogen associated communities such as thiomonas might be the reason for this phenomenon fig 3 g and fig s7 thus although the strength of inorganic nitrogen transformation was low the higher concentration of inorganic nitrogen in sewage group b could also have potential to promote the ammoxidation and denitrification processes in fact the nitrogen source in the sewage was the only variation between groups a and b and thus the different characteristics of carbon nitrogen and sulfur associated communities in group a and b must be induced by the nitrogen especially the amino acids participating in the reproduction and metabolism of these communities the mechanism of these processes needed to be further revealed 3 3 analysis of functional gene classifications and metabolic pathways under different nitrogen conditions in sewers 3 3 1 functional classification of genes in groups a and b as described above the results of qpcr showed the potential of dominant carbon nitrogen and sulfur associated communities under different nitrogen conditions there were many other metabolic functions supporting these processes constituting the carbon nitrogen and sulfur bioconversions in the sewer thompson et al 2019 the use of metagenomic sequencing to classify gene functions has proven to be reliable for revealing the characteristics of functional genes in diverse metabolisms simon and daniel 2011 each sample and mixed assembly of scaftigs 500 bp were used to predict open reading frames with metagenemark oh et al 2014 and the gene catalogue unigenes that was ultimately used for subsequent analysis was obtained through a series of analyses methane metabolism fatty acid metabolism and fatty acid degradation were the dominant annotations for carbon metabolism fig 4 the numbers of functional category genes were higher in group a while the numbers of functional category genes for nitrogen and sulfur metabolisms were higher in group b in line with the qpcr results the amino acid biosynthesis genes comprised the highest proportion and the numbers of genes in the functional categories of amino acid biosynthesis and dna replication were more abundant in group a that original nitrogen pollutants were assimilated by sewer microbial communities for reproduction and the type of the nitrogen pollutant affected the expression of carbon nitrogen and sulfur bioconversions in the sewers 3 3 2 metabolic pathways of carbon nitrogen and sulfur in groups a and b by metagenome to further explore the matrix utilization and metabolic characteristics of carbon nitrogen and sulfur in biofilms in the sewer system a metagenomic approach was utilized to determine the metabolic pathways of the biochemical reactions fig 5 shows the results of the annotation of key genes and enzymes in carbon nitrogen and sulfur metabolic processes using the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg pathway database after metagenomic detection yu and zhang 2012 as shown in fig 5a there were two representative pathways for the carbon cycle glucose and methane metabolism and we also found that majority of the genes coding for enzymes such as 2 7 1 40 pyruvate kinase and 1 2 7 4 anaerobic carbon monoxide dehydrogenase catalytic subunit were higher in group a indicating higher expression of the key genes in group a glycine and aspartic acid were involved in methane and glucose metabolism respectively fig 5a which could support carbon associated bioconversions in sewers the distribution of amino acids in fig 1 indicates that group a was enriched in glycine and aspartic acid and that higher concentrations of organic nitrogen sources group a could induce the generation of glycine and aspartic acid and the enrichment of these amino acids could serve as the dominant driver of the strong carbon associated bioconversion in group a although nitrification and denitrification genes were observed in both groups table s5 a relatively small number of genes was associated with nitrification while the numbers of denitrification genes differed the numbers of genes coding for 1 7 2 1 nitrite reductase and 1 7 2 5 nitric oxide reductase in group b were higher fig 5b indicating a higher denitrification capacity in group b a finding which was also supported by the qpcr results of dnb as shown in fig 5c sulfate reduction appeared to be the dominant process of sulfur metabolism the metagenomic results showed that the numbers of genes coding for enzyme such as 1 8 99 2 adenylyl sulfate reductase and 2 5 1 47 cysteine synthase were higher in group b fig 5c demonstrating that group b had a higher sulfur cycle capacity we found that serine cysteine and methionine played an important role in the sulfur cycle and the concentrations of these amino acids especially methionine were significantly higher in group b fig 1 thus it could be concluded that an environment with a high proportion of inorganic nitrogen could promote the generation of methionine serine and cysteine and then stimulate sulfur associated bioconversion in sewers 3 4 ecological systems involving carbon nitrogen and sulfur bioconversions under different nitrogen conditions based on the analysis of the distribution of amino acids microbial community responses and the activity of metabolic pathways under different nitrogen conditions in the sewer it could be concluded that nitrogen involved in the bioconversions could significantly affect pollutant transformation the biochemical reactions were not isolated in the sewers but formed an interactive ecosystem with the nitrogen source as its core to improve the understanding of the sewer ecosystem the mechanisms of vital movements in groups a and b were explored using metagenomics as shown in fig 6 proline can improve the cell membrane and enhance the stability of the membrane structure in biofilms slabbert and krüger 2014 this improvement is conducive to the growth of biofilms and produces a more abundant microbial community structure the principal function of glycine is as a precursor to the formation of proteins and glycine processing can modify the rate of protein synthesis lei et al 2020 tyrosine phosphorylation has a role in signal transduction and enzyme activity regulation which promotes the formation of genes nisa et al 2017 proline glycine and tyrosine were specific to group a and the movements mentioned above could stimulate the reproduction of microbial communities and the consumption of carbon sources diversity in microbial communities was higher in group a and carbon associated bioconversions could be more easily achieved in group a the presence of alanine in group b also induced unique characteristics in the ecosystem alanine can promote the activity of microorganisms in nitrogen cycling through a cracking function zagorski and sehested 1998 the higher concentration of serine cysteine and methionine in group b promoted the sulfur cycling in the sewers and the intermediate product oxaloacetate was involved in the amino acid synthesis leading to the generation of sulfur associated communities this study investigated the variations in amino acids characteristics of microorganisms metabolic pathways and changes in ecological systems under different nitrogen conditions in a sewer system the results showed that due to a higher organic nitrogen content glycine and aspartic were enriched in group a and induced stronger expression of methane metabolism carbon associated bioconversion than was apparent in group b due to higher inorganic nitrogen content serine cysteine and methionine were enriched in group b which promoted the sulfur cycle and generated higher levels of sulfide this biological information was also demonstrated by the detection of sulfide and methane along the sewer system the higher methane concentration was detected in group a and the higher sulfide concentration was detected in group b nitrogen composition in the sewage changed the functioning of the sewer ecosystem and therefore could affect undesirable processes such as sulfide and methane generation and pipe corrosion in urban sewer systems due to the importance of nitrogen substrates the detection of the nitrogen composition in sewage can serve as the basis for the analysis and prediction of undesirable processes in urban sewer systems it should be noted that to achieve more detailed ecosystem conversion in sewer systems under different nitrogen conditions the substrate correlations among carbon nitrogen and sulfur metabolism cycles and the gene correlation among those functional communities should be explored under more elaborate nitrogen conditions through batch tests in the future 4 conclusions based on a 1200 m pilot experimental sewer system the interactions of carbon nitrogen and sulfur bioconversions in the ecosystem of sewers were investigated in this study the main findings are as follows 1 the dominant amino acids in group a were methionine and threonine accounting for 32 67 and 29 86 respectively while methionine and aspartic acid were dominant in group b accounting for 66 24 and 8 98 respectively the different amino acid distributions in group a and b were the basis of the changes in sewer ecosystems under two typical nitrogen conditions 2 based on qpcr results the abundance of hpa and ma carbon associated communities was higher in group a while those of aob dnb and srb nitrogen and sulfur associated communities were higher in group b the differences in structure between group a and b indicated that dominant functions varied 3 metagenomic analysis indicated that due to the different characteristics of amino acid distribution the strength of carbon bioconversion was higher in group a while the strengths of nitrogen and sulfur bioconversion were higher in group b therefore the differences in nitrogen composition in sewage could affect undesirable processes such as sulfide and methane generation in urban sewer systems 4 we investigated the ecosystems in sewers by analysing the annotation of key genes and enzymes involved in the nitrogen cycle our results suggest that nitrogen bioconversion should not be overlooked in sewers and must be a core issue in studies on sewage

17518,although water produced by reverse osmosis ro filtration has low bacterial growth potential bgp post treatment of ro permeate which is necessary prior to distribution and human consumption needs to be examined because of the potential re introduction of nutrients contaminants in this study drinking water produced from anaerobic groundwater by ro and post treatment ion exchange calcite contactors and aeration was compared with that produced by conventional treatment comprising dry sand filtration pellet softening rapid sand filtration activated carbon filtration and uv disinfection the multi parametric assessment of biological stability included bacterial quantification nutrient concentration and composition as well as bacterial community composition and diversity results showed that ro permeate remineralised in the laboratory has an extremely low bgp 50 12 103 icc ml which increased to 130 10 103 icc ml after site post treatment despite the negative impact of post treatment the bgp of the finished ro treated water was 75 lower than that of conventionally treated water organic carbon limited bacterial growth in both ro treated and conventionally treated waters the increased bgp in ro treated water was caused by the re introduction of nutrients during post treatment similarly otus introduced during post treatment assigned to the phyla of proteobacteria and bacteroidetes 75 85 were not present in the source groundwater conversely conventionally treated water shared some otus with the source groundwater it is clear that ro based treatment achieved an extremely low bgp which can be further improved by optimising post treatment such as using high purity calcite the multi parametric approach adopted in this study can offer insights into growth

utilities are aiming at producing biologically safe and stable drinking water i e water that does not promote excessive bacterial growth during distribution to achieve that source water undergoes different treatment processes to remove bacteria and growth promoting nutrients the multi barrier treatment approach is especially needed in the netherlands where chlorine is neither used for primary disinfection nor for maintaining disinfectant residual in the distribution network groundwater accounts for about two thirds of total drinking water in the netherlands van der kooij and veenendaal

bacterial growth potential bgp escobar et al 2000 park and hu 2010 dixon et al 2012 thayanukul et al 2013 one of the clear advantages of applying ro in drinking water treatment is that it can achieve a significant reduction in biofilm formation compared to conventional treatment which controls the growth of l pneumophila to a large extent learbuch et al 2019 to comply with drinking water regulations post treatment of ro permeate is necessary for remineralisation e g calcium and magnesium maintaining chemical stability and improving taste vingerhoeds et al 2016 however the post treatment steps are likely to re contaminate ro permeate by introducing organic and inorganic components such as the observed increase in bgp caused by the re introduction of growth promoting nutrients in the permeate sousi et al 2018 until now the potential negative effects of post treatment on biological stability and its control strategies are still poorly documented several methodologies and protocols have been developed for the assessment of drinking water biological stability including measuring the nutrients as aoc and biodegradable organic carbon bdoc and enumerating bacteria as bgp and biofilm formation potential bfp recently bacterial community profiling has been introduced as a complementary tool which elevates the assessment of biological stability to include both quantity and community aspects lautenschlager et al 2013 and prest et al 2014 applied a multi parametric approach that combined flow cytometric cell counting and 16s rrna sequencing which examined different aspects of microbiological water quality and captured the changes that cannot be reflected by single parameter studies as the type and composition of nutrients are important for both bacterial growth and shaping the bacterial community elhadidy et al 2016 nescerecka et al 2018 including a detailed analysis of carbon phosphate and nitrogen fractions in the multi parametric approach is necessary to understand the driving force for bacterial growth such an integral multi parametric approach will be especially powerful for comparing treatment plant performance and or diagnosing problems related to bacterial growth in drinking water the objective of this study was to conduct a multi parametric comparison of biological stability of drinking water produced from anaerobic groundwater by ro based treatment ro filtration and post treatment and conventional treatment the integral comparison includes the changes in bacterial quantification and growth potential nutrient concentration and composition and the bacterial community composition and diversity across steps in the different treatment lines based on which the treatment performance was evaluated and recommendations were given on optimising the quality of ro treated drinking water 2 materials and methods 2 1 water samples the kamerik drinking water treatment plant oasen drinking water company gouda netherlands currently produces 340 m3 h of drinking water from anaerobic groundwater agw by conventional water treatment processes which are given in fig 1 a in the following order spray

processes is denoted as site remin and has a final ph of 7 8 0 2 the full treatment details are given in table s1 supplementary information water samples were collected after each treatment step in both the conventional and ro based treatment lines the main sampling campaign was conducted in march 2019 where all the analyses mentioned in the following section were performed an additional campaign was conducted in may 2019 where only intact cell count icc and atp analyses were performed 2 2 the multi parametric comparison components 2 2 1 intact cell count icc and adenosine triphosphate atp intact cell count icc was measured using flow cytometry bd accuri c6 fcm bd biosciences belgium coupled with dna staining as previously described by prest et al 2016a in short each sample 500 µl per replicate was stained with 5 µl of a mix of sybr green i and propidium iodide stains and heated for 10 min before fcm measurement using similar settings and gating the fcm detection limit is 103 icc ml which was determined using ultrapure water milli q water merck millipore moreover the size of bacteria was classified between large and small using high and low nucleic acid hna and lna characteristics obtained by the fcm wang et al 2009 microbial intra cellular atp was measured according to the filtration based method described by abushaban et al 2019 using the water glo testing kit lysis reagent and detection reagent and glomax 20 20 luminometer promega corp usa the detection limit is 0 1 ng atp l 2 2 2 bacterial growth potential bgp bgp of water was measured according to sousi et al 2018 in short samples were taken in aoc free glassware pre treated by pasteurisation 70 c for 30 min to remove indigenous bacteria inoculated with a natural bacterial consortium 104 icc ml originating from ctw freshly collected at each sampling campaign distributed into three individual aoc free vials i e triplicate measurements per sample incubated in the dark at 30 c and lastly measured for icc over a growth period of 3 weeks commonly on day 0 1 3 6 8 10 13 16 and 20 the results were expressed as the maximum cell count obtained during the incubation period bgpmax the blank was prepared by adjusting the mineral content of ro permeate at the laboratory using chemical stock solutions with high purity nahco3 ph of 7 8 0 2 122 mg l hco3 cacl2 40 mg l ca2 and mgcl2 4 mg l mg2 the blank laboratory remineralised ro permeate is denoted as lab remin and was spiked with kh2po4 5 μg l po4 p and kno3 50 μg n l to ensure that carbon was the growth limiting nutrient unless otherwise mentioned ion exchange effluent samples were also remineralised with the same concentration of nahco3 cacl2 and mgcl2 to ensure that bacterial growth is not limited by minerals it is worthwhile to mention that the bgp of anaerobic groundwater agw might be underestimated because of the very high nutrient content e g phosphate and humic substances which might have formed complexes e g with iron when oxygen was introduced during the test and thus limiting the bioavailability of those nutrients 2 2 3 bacterial growth promoting nutrients each water sample was analysed for organic carbon c and phosphate po4 p concentrations liquid chromatography organic carbon detection lc ocd analysis was performed at het waterlaboratorium haarlem netherlands to measure the concentration of carbon fractions as described by huber et al 2011 the carbon fractions were distinguished based on their molecular weight mw and they are from largest to smallest biopolymers proteins and polysaccharides humic substances building blocks low molecular weight acids and neutrals the reporting limit of lc ocd analysis is 100 μg c l for biopolymers and 200 μg c l for the other fractions phosphate was measured at the rijkswaterstaat laboratory lelystad netherlands using the ascorbic acid method the method implied the reaction of ammonium molybdate and antimony sodium tartrate with orthophosphate po4 3 in an acidic medium to form a complex that was reduced to a blue coloured compound by ascorbic acid the blue colour intensity was measured within 30 min by spectrophotometry 880 nm and then converted to a phosphorus concentration using a calibration line the detection limit was 0 3 µg l po4 p to identify bacterial growth limiting nutrients bgp of water samples was measured with the addition of different combinations of nutrients as previously described by prest et al 2016a and shown in table 1 the used nutrient stocks were carbon 1 07 g l c2h3nao2

remin and ctw respectively were tested 2 2 4 dna extraction sequencing and data processing genomic dna extraction was performed as previously described by liu et al 2018 in short water samples 500 ml duplicate were filtered using 0 22 µm cellulose ester membranes gpwp04700 millipore ireland and afterwards pre treated using fastdna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals solon oh usa as demonstrated in the instruction manual thereafter 16s rrna gene of the extracted genomic dna was amplified targeting the v3 v4 regions a primer set of 341f 5 cctacgggnggcwgcag 3 and 785r 5 gactachvgggtatctaatcc 3 illumina miseq platform 300 bp paired reads was used for sequencing at baseclear leiden netherlands where the illumina sequencing adaptors were appended to the 5 end the sequencing data is available in the ncbi database bioproject id prjna631515 and information about the sample origin is given in table s2 the sequences generated from the illumina miseq analysis of the 16s rrna gene amplicons were processed i e filtered clustered and taxonomically assigned and aligned using the quantitative insights into microbial ecology qiime2 v2018 6 pipeline with the default settings raw sequences were first processed using dada2 including quality filtering denoising paired end sequence merging and chimera filtering dada2 generated unique amplicon sequence variants that were equivalent to 100 similarity operational taxonomic units otus in the conventional practice in this publication the term otu is used for the purpose of simplicity taxonomy was assigned using q2 feature classifier customized for the primer set used in this study with silva ssu database release 132 multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree construction were performed using the qiime2 plugin q2 phylogeny alpha and beta diversity analyses were performed using the qiime2 plugin q2 diversity weighted and unweighted unifrac distance matrices were constructed from the phylogenetic tree liu et al 2020 otus with relative abundance in the samples of 0 5 were considered dominant the absolute abundance of selected otus was calculated by multiplying their relative abundance by total cell count tcc obtained using fcm as proposed by props et al 2017 2 3 statistical analysis the significance level of observed differences between samples was examined using student s t test and one way analysis of variance anova test after affirming the data normality q q plots chi squared tests and kolmogorov smirnov tests canonical correspondence analysis cca was carried out using xlstat version 2019 4 2 63762 to

similarities of dna sequences based on weighted unifrac distance matrix where the significance of dis similarities has been tested using permutational multivariate analysis of variance permanova 3 results 3 1 intact cell count icc and atp concentration across treatment lines the trends in intact cell count icc and atp concentration across the conventional and ro based treatment lines from two sampling campaigns are shown in fig 2 and fig s1 where similar trends were observed except for concentrations in the source anaerobic groundwater agw icc and atp concentration in the source anaerobic groundwater agw were 215 40 103 icc ml and 0 5 ng atp l fig 2 which increased by a factor 3 and 28 respectively after dry sand filtration dsf and softening sof in the conventional treatment line where oxygen was introduced in the water thereafter icc decreased along the following conventional treatment units reaching 390 11 103 icc ml in the finished conventionally treated drinking water ctw this decrease in icc was accompanied with a considerable decrease 70 in atp to the range of 4 5 ng atp l after rsf and until the end of the conventional treatment ctw in the ro based treatment line the icc after ro filtration and ion exchange were lower than the fcm detection limit 103 icc ml 99 6 removal which increased to 30 5 103 icc ml after calcite contactors cc and further to 90 1 103 icc ml after tower aeration site remin similarly atp dropped below the detection limit after ro filtration 0 1 ng atp l and remained at this level after ion exchange iex thereafter it increased after post treatment with cc to 2 ng atp l and further to 7 5 ng atp l in the finished ro treated water after tower aeration site remin the percentage of high nucleic acid bacteria hna bacteria within icc decreased across the conventional treatment from 60 after dsf and sof to 40 45 after rsf and until ctw however this percentage increased across the ro based treatment and reached up to 85 in cc and site remin a good correlation was found between hna bacteria and atp fig s2 r 2 0 77 ro based treatment r 2 0 65 conventional treatment remarkably icc in the finished ro treated water was 75 lower than that of conventionally treated water whereas the contrary was observed for atp which resulted in a significantly higher p 0 05 atp per cell value for ro treated water than conventionally treated water average of two sampling campaigns 9 07 10 17 vs 1 71 10 17 g atp cell table s3 indicating different community composition between the two treatment lines 3 2 bgp and nutrient composition of conventionally treated and ro treated water the profiling of the two treatment lines showed considerably different degrees of bgp and nutrient removal the conventional treatment line reduced the bgp by 60 from 1 250 100 103 in agw to 450 550 103 icc ml across the different treatment steps where the bgp of conventionally treated water ctw was 515 5 103 icc ml fig 3 a meanwhile doc decreased from 7 2 mg l in agw to 6 0 mg l in ctw table 2 notably the humic substances which accounted for 70 of doc in agw showed the highest removal in the conventional treatment line from 5 2 mg l to 4 3 mg l phosphate was also considerably reduced mainly during dsf 98 from 553 µg l po4 p in agw to 7 µg l po4 p in dsf reaching down to 1 µg l po4 p in ctw table 2 similarly ammonium was also reduced below 0 02 mg l nh4 n limit of detection by the conventional treatment table 2 the results showed that nitrification was the main mechanism for ammonium removal where ammonium nh4 in agw 2 90 0 10 mg l nh4 n was completely converted into nitrate no3 in ctw 2 77 0 40 mg l no3 n methane which was present at 2 000 4 000 µg ch4 l in agw was reduced to 10 20 µg ch4 l in ctw the ro based treatment showed a substantial bgp reduction 96 from 1 250 100 103 icc ml in agw to 50 12 103 icc ml in lab remin i e ro permeate after remineralisation at the laboratory fig 3b however the bgp increased by 160 after remineralisation using calcite contactors cc and tower aeration site remin reaching 130 10 103 icc ml the lc ocd analysis revealed that all organic matter fractions were considerably retained by ro filtration to levels below the reporting limit table 2 despite the increase in bgp after post treatment there was no detectable increase in any doc fraction by the lc ocd for phosphate a sharp decrease from 553 µg l po4 p to 1 µg l po4 p was observed after ro filtration followed by an increase across the post treatment to 7 µg l po4 p table 2 in contrast to conventional treatment nitrification was insignificant within the ro based treatment line where ammonium in agw was mostly retained by the ro membrane 0 17 0 02 mg l nh4 n in ro permeate and was further removed by absorption in ion exchange resins 0 02 mg l nh4 n this resulted in a low concentration of nitrate in ro treated water 0 23 0 05 mg l nh4 n table 2 methane in ro treated water was at similar concentrations as in ctw table 2 the investigation of the growth limiting nutrient fig 4 revealed that the growth in the examined water types was limited by organic carbon for all samples the difference between the actual bgp i e without nutrient addition to the sample and the c limited bgp i e samples spiked with all nutrients except for carbon was insignificant p 0 05 contrarily the bgp of samples with limited phosphate nitrogen and trace elements fe mn zn co and b was significantly p 0 05 higher than the actual bgp of the corresponding sample interestingly the p limited bgp of site remin was 50 higher than that of ctw and lab remin bacterial community in total 29526 sequences were generated for 22 samples which were assigned to 295 bacterial genera the rarefaction curve became plateaued after 1750 and 650 sequences were retrieved for conventional and ro based treatment lines respectively indicating that sufficient sample coverage was obtained fig s3 library size per sample is given in table s7 which showed that few sequences were obtained for ro treated water due to the too low dna content in the sample the average sequences per sample for the entire dataset was 1400 which was low compared to other recent studies beta diversity the similarity in the communities obtained for the duplicate samples reflected high reproducibility and reliability fig 5 pcoa plot of the present study moreover the plot shows that the treatment shaped the composition of bacterial communities where the observed differences between the three clusters were significant as affirmed using permanova p 0 05 table s4 the bacterial community of source water agw were clearly distinguished from that of treated water especially for the ro based treatment for the conventional treatment the bacterial communities shifted across the steps where water after dsf sof and rsf contained similar communities but different from those detected after acf uvd and ctw for the ro based treatment the communities of post treated ro permeate were closely clustered indicating a high similarity among the samples after iex cc and site remin alpha diversity looking into the dominant otus genus level relative abundance 0 5 among all water samples there were 197 otus assigned to 120 genera as shown in the heatmap fig 6 table s5 for taxonomy information the venn diagrams fig s4 show that no dominant otus were shared between source anaerobic groundwater agw 15 dominant otus and water after any steps in the ro based treatment line iex cc and site remin 14 10 and 33 dominant otus respectively conversely there were three dominant otus shared between agw and ctw 23 dominant otus which were assigned to the class of deltaproteobacteria parcubacteria and omnitrophicaeota whereas the only otu shared between ctw and site remin was assigned to the family of oligoflexaceae community composition the column plots at phylum class and order levels are presented in fig s5 at phylum level proteobacteria was significantly present in all samples irrespective of the treatment where the relative abundance ranged from 10 in source water agw to 20 50 after conventional treatment and 55 80 in water after ro based treatment patescibacteria was more abundant in conventionally treated water 20 60 than ro treated water 5 omnitrophicaeota and nitrospirae were dominant in source water only agw 30 where their relative abundance decreased to 1 19 after conventional treatment and below 0 5 after ro based treatment at genus level otus belonging to families characterised as methanotrophs methane oxidising bacteria were detected in both treatment lines after steps where oxygen was introduced fig 6 4 otus for conventional treatment exclusively after dsf and sof 4 otus for ro based treatment exclusively after cc and site remin among which 1 otu was shared by all table s6 interestingly all 8 otus were assigned to type i methanotrophs that belong to methylomonaceae including methylovulum spp 1 methylobacter spp 6 methyloglobulus spp 2 crenothrix spp 2 3 and other uncultured genera 2 5 otus belonging to the families which characterised as nitrifiers were specifically found in the water after the first steps of conventional treatment i e dsf sof and rsf fig 6 with different relative abundances the otus were assigned to ammonium oxidising bacteria aob e g nitrosomonas 6 and nitrite oxidising bacteria nob e g candidatus nitrotoga 1 and nitrospira 2 10 conversely none of them were found in ro treated water except for a poorly documented otu namely gouta6 belonging to aob of nitrosomonadaceae table s6 the absolute abundance of methanotrophs and nitrifiers after each treatment step is shown in fig s6 the methanotrophs ranged from 3 70 103 icc ml and the nitrifiers ranged from 6 165 103 icc ml both of which were more abundant in both treatment lines after oxygen was introduced there were several genera present in ro treated water known for iron manganese and sulfur oxidation such as sulfuricurvum 12 ferritrophicum 5 leptothrix 5 geobacter 3 and geothrix 2 similarly otus belonging to families of characterised iron oxidisers e g the family gallionellaceae were found in the conventional treatment line 3 3 correlation between nutrients and microbiological parameters the influence of nutrients lc ocd fractions and phosphate on microbiological parameters icc atp and bgp and community composition otus with relative abundance 0 5 was investigated using cca the results revealed that bacterial growth either within the treatment units icc and atp or at the laboratory bgp was strongly correlated to the concentration of doc fractions more specifically building blocks humic substances and neutrals rather than phosphate fig s7a the growth was not influenced by biopolymers and acids because their concentrations were below the reporting limit for all water samples regarding community composition fig s7b about 50 of the dominant otus found in samples were strongly correlated to the concentration of building blocks humic substances and neutrals group 1 whereas 23 were fairly well correlated to phosphate group 2 however no clear trend was observed with respect to which otus could grow on each nutrient fraction 4 discussion the multi parametric comparison approach applied in this study enabled better understanding of the microbiological water quality at different stages of the treatment this approach included measuring several microbiological parameters and studying the relationship between them the parameters included are the dynamics of bacterial load measured as numbers cell count bacterial activity atp concentration and composition 16s rrna gene sequencing across treatment as well as the growth potential of these bacteria in water bgp and the driving factors for this growth nutrients this multi parametric approach was used to compare conventionally and ro treated drinking water as discussed below 4 1 characterisations of bacterial cells icc atp and atp per cell as quantified by cell count and atp concentration bacteria were better retained by the ro membrane 99 6 removal where the values in ro permeate were below the detection limit 103 icc ml 0 1 ng atp l this complies with the fact that ro membrane is an effective barrier for microorganisms madaeni 1999 pype et al 2016 however this superior ro permeate quality could be influenced by the post treatment processes sousi et al 2018 which was also observed in the present study as increased icc and atp after the pilot scale remineralisation calcite contactors and tower aeration units the deterioration of biological water quality could be attributed to practical factors such as bacteria sloughing off the surface biofilm of calcite grains and or packing material filling the aeration tower interestingly it is noticed that the increase in atp was particularly correlated to the increased percentage of hna bacteria within icc for both ro treated water r 2 0 77 and conventional treatment r 2 0 65 which agrees with previous findings siebel et al 2008 liu et al 2013 and can be attributed to the high activity and large cell size of hna bacteria lebaron et al 2001 proctor et al 2018 the changes in hna bacteria and atp across the treatment lines can be explained by the nature of treatment applied for instance the highest removal of hna bacteria by the conventional treatment line 30 occurred within the rapid sand filters where physical retention of larger bacterial cells is more efficient vital et al 2012 fujioka et al 2019 and significant atp reduction could be obtained liu et al 2013 regarding the calculated atp per cell the obtained values ranging from 0 70 11 32 10 17 g atp cell were in line with previous findings of hammes et al 2010 for different aquatic environments average 1 75 10 10 nmol cell equivalent to 8 89 10 17 g atp cell but lower than reported values for bacteria growing under starvation condition up to 30 10 17 g atp cell webster et al 1985 the latter value was obtained for specific bacterial species and might not be applicable to others and these values were calculated based on heterotrophic plate count which would significantly underestimate the cell count and result in higher atp per cell values van nevel et al 2017 comparing the two treatment lines in the present study the atp per cell of the post treated ro permeate was 5 times higher than that of conventionally treated water 9 07 10 17 vs 1 71 10 17 g atp cell this could be partially explained by the percentage of large and active cells i e hna bacteria in each water type 85 vs 40 45 nonetheless the low atp per cell for the conventionally treated water was in line with previously reported values for water after granular activated carbon filtration magic knezev and van der kooij 2004 moreover the composition of bacterial communities present in water could influence atp per cell values eydal and pedersen 2007 as confirmed by the bacterial community analysis members of the patescibacteria which remarkably pass 0 2 µm and even 0 1 µm filters herrmann et al 2019 were more abundant in conventionally treated water 20 60 than in post treated ro permeate 5 on the other hand members of proteobacteria and bacteroidetes that are generally known for large cell size based on fcm findings proctor et al 2018 accounted for 75 85 of bacterial communities in ro treated water 4 2 bgp and the factors driving bacterial growth nutrients the present study also confirmed the effectiveness of ro filtration in controlling the bgp of water because of its high efficiency of nutrient removal 97 carbon 99 5 phosphate which complies with previous studies jacobson et al 2009 park and hu 2010 thayanukul et al 2013 though the post ro treatment caused an increase in bgp the bgp of ro treated water was still lower than that of conventionally treated water by a factor of 4 as reported in a recent study with the same water 10 times lower biofilm formation potential bfp was found for ro based treatment compared to that of conventionally treated water learbuch et al 2019 indicating even higher efficiency in controlling biofilm formation by ro filtration and possibly different growth dynamics between planktonic bacteria and biofilm the increased bgp after post treatment can be attributed to the introduction of growth promoting nutrients during those processes as confirmed by phosphate measurement which increased more than 7 times from 1 to 7 µg l po4 p after calcite contactors as demonstrated by the nutrient limitation tests the p limited bgp of site post treated ro permeate was higher than that of lab post treated ro permeate and conventionally treated water 2 089 103 vs 1 144 103 vs 1 383 103 icc ml confirming again the higher phosphate concentration in site post treated ro permeate compared to lab remin and ctw introduced by calcite contactors though the introduction of carbon was not detectable using lc ocd analysis since the concentrations both before and after the post treatment were below the reporting limit it was confirmed by the nutrient limitation tests where carbon was the growth limiting nutrient before and after the post treatment regardless of the bgp value the carbon limitation has been commonly found in many types of water huck 1990 hu et al 1999 van der kooij 2000 liu et al 2015 prest et al 2016a as observed also for water types tested in this study even when the phosphate concentration was very low 1 µg l po4 p moreover the carbon limitation in all samples was confirmed with the canonical correspondence analysis cca without identifying which carbon fraction was the most relevant for growth where a previous study showed that these bacteria could grow on carbon with different molecular characteristics ranging from readily available to more complex organic carbon sousi et al 2020 similarly the link between the presence of different otus and carbon fractions needs to be further explored 4 3 shifts in bacterial communities the present study showed that both the diversity and composition of bacterial communities were largely influenced by water treatment processes which complies with previous studies on different drinking water treatment processes ivone et al 2013 liao et al 2015 li et al 2017 liu et al 2018 since ro filtration could effectively remove bacteria present in source water the developed bacterial community in post treated ro permeate was completely different from the source this can be used as a control for the observations in the conventional treatment scheme for example ro filtration completely removed the dominant phyla i e nitrospirae and omnitrophicaeota from source anaerobic groundwater however only the strictly anaerobic members of the nitrospirae e g thermodesulfovibrionia garrity et al 2001 were effectively removed in the very first conventional treatment step i e dsf similarly the relative abundance of the omnitrophicaeota decreased across the conventional treatment line because most of the species within this phylum were anaerobic which could not survive in oxygen rich fresh water rivas marín and devos 2018 moreover it is interesting to observe the shifts in methane oxidising bacteria mob ammonium oxidising bacteria aob and nitrite oxidising bacteria nob across the treatment lines the high concentration of ch4 2 4 mg l in source groundwater and the introduction of oxygen during aeration contributed to the presence of mob in both conventional and ro based treatment schemes nicol et al 2003 dispirito et al 2016 only type i methanotrophs were detected e g methylovulum spp methylobacter spp and methyloglobulus spp which is typical for drinking water lipponen et al 2004 the presence of only type i methanotrophs indicates that the residence time of methane within the aeration towers was short as those bacteria are known to rapidly oxidise methane in an oxygen rich environment graham et al 1993 hanson and hanson 1996 since methane is the sole carbon source for these bacteria their presence in the dsf and sof treatment steps indicates that methane was considerably removed in these treatment units resulting in 20 µg l ch4 in the following conventional treatment steps the nitrification activity within the conventional treatment line was clearly higher than that in the ro based line for example the aob e g nitrosomonas spp and nob e g candidatus nitrotoga spp nitrospira spp prosser et al 2014 koch et al 2015 kitzinger et al 2018 were detected in conventional treatment units dfs sof and rsf but not in the ro based scheme the same observation was confirmed by the complete oxidation of ammonium present in source groundwater 2 90 0 10 mg n l to nitrate in the conventionally treated water 2 77 0 40 mg n l table 2 whereas the nitrification activity within the ro based treatment scheme was minimal where aob and nob were absent because the ammonium was physically retained by ro membrane to 0 17 mg n l and further absorbed by post ion exchange 0 02 mg n l without conversion to nitrate lastly the presence of several bacterial genera in ro treated water that are known to be involved in the oxidation of iron manganese and sulfur e g sulfuricurvum ferritrophicum leptothrix geobacter and geothrix hedrich et al 2011 schmidt et al 2014 indicates that these metals were re introduced during post treatment nonetheless the presence of such genera in conventionally treated anaerobic groundwater e g the family gallionellaceae has been previously reported hallbeck and pedersen 2014 4 4 practical insights for managing microbiological water quality despite the influences of post treatment on the quality of ro permeate the finished ro treated water had much lower cell count and bgp compared with conventionally treated water to mitigate the negative influences of post treatment it is recommended to use high quality calcite grains for remineralisation to prevent the introduction of organic and inorganic nutrients furthermore aeration towers should be maintained and cleaned more frequently to reduce bacterial growth on the packing material it should be noted that the current study was conducted with groundwater and the sampling period did not cover the whole seasons the observations might be different for surface water systems subjected to significant seasonal variations for which a sampling program including different seasons is high recommended though the effect of seasonal variations on the analysed parameters was beyond the focus of this study negative influences of post treatment were previously demonstrated throughout the year sousi et al 2020 the multi parametric evaluation discussed above offered an integral understanding of the stability and changes in microbiological water quality between two treatment lines considering the bacterial quantity and activity nutrient concentration and composition as well as bacterial community composition and diversity beyond the simple number of cells and or bioactivity the comprehensive dataset obtained in this study allows in depth assessment of which bacteria are growing and why in each step of the treatment process besides regular monitoring the methodology proposed is especially useful when water quality deteriorates during treatment and remedial actions are required to manage biological water quality although multi parametric monitoring is expensive it is recommended as a complementary approach when water quality deterioration is detected during regular monitoring for the microbiology of drinking water distribution system attributed to its high efficiency in removing nutrients the ro based treatment will be useful in controlling the growth of both planktonic bacteria and biofilm regarding the microbes the comparison between conventional and ro based treatment demonstrated the possible quantitative and qualitative control of drinking water microbiology by using ro membranes as an absolute barrier for cells considering produced water is the seed for the microbes to thrive in water biofilm and loose deposits in the downstream drinking water distribution system liu et al 2018 it could be a reasonable vision to manage the microbial ecology of drinking water distribution systems by introducing probiotic microbes rather than microbial contamination through post ro treatment to occupy the niches and form a predefined microbial ecology wang et al 2013 5 conclusions the following conclusions can be drawn based on this study ro filtration significantly reduced the bgp of source groundwater to an extremely low level of 50 12 103 icc ml in lab remineralised ro permeate which increased again to 130 10 103 icc ml when ro permeate underwent site post treatment despite this increase the bgp of post treated ro permeate was 75 lower than that of conventionally treated water 130 10 103 vs 450 550 103 icc ml carbon was the bacterial growth limiting nutrient for both ro treated and conventionally treated water phosphate did not limit bacterial growth even at very low concentrations 1 µg l po4 p the type of water treatment shaped the bacterial community of the finished treated water some genera were shared between source anaerobic groundwater and conventionally treated water whereas the bacterial genera in post treated ro permeate were mainly introduced

17518,although water produced by reverse osmosis ro filtration has low bacterial growth potential bgp post treatment of ro permeate which is necessary prior to distribution and human consumption needs to be examined because of the potential re introduction of nutrients contaminants in this study drinking water produced from anaerobic groundwater by ro and post treatment ion exchange calcite contactors and aeration was compared with that produced by conventional treatment comprising dry sand filtration pellet softening rapid sand filtration activated carbon filtration and uv disinfection the multi parametric assessment of biological stability included bacterial quantification nutrient concentration and composition as well as bacterial community composition and diversity results showed that ro permeate remineralised in the laboratory has an extremely low bgp 50 12 103 icc ml which increased to 130 10 103 icc ml after site post treatment despite the negative impact of post treatment the bgp of the finished ro treated water was 75 lower than that of conventionally treated water organic carbon limited bacterial growth in both ro treated and conventionally treated waters the increased bgp in ro treated water was caused by the re introduction of nutrients during post treatment similarly otus introduced during post treatment assigned to the phyla of proteobacteria and bacteroidetes 75 85 were not present in the source groundwater conversely conventionally treated water shared some otus with the source groundwater it is clear that ro based treatment achieved an extremely low bgp which can be further improved by optimising post treatment such as using high purity calcite the multi parametric approach adopted in this study can offer insights into growth

utilities are aiming at producing biologically safe and stable drinking water i e water that does not promote excessive bacterial growth during distribution to achieve that source water undergoes different treatment processes to remove bacteria and growth promoting nutrients the multi barrier treatment approach is especially needed in the netherlands where chlorine is neither used for primary disinfection nor for maintaining disinfectant residual in the distribution network groundwater accounts for about two thirds of total drinking water in the netherlands van der kooij and veenendaal

treatment steps are likely to re contaminate ro permeate by introducing organic and inorganic components such as the observed increase in bgp caused by the re introduction of growth promoting nutrients in the permeate sousi et al 2018 until now the potential negative effects of post treatment on biological stability and its control strategies are still poorly documented several methodologies and protocols have been developed for the assessment of drinking water biological stability including measuring the nutrients as aoc and biodegradable organic carbon bdoc and enumerating bacteria as bgp and biofilm formation potential bfp recently bacterial community profiling has been introduced as a complementary tool which elevates the assessment of biological stability to include both quantity and community aspects lautenschlager et al 2013 and prest et al 2014 applied a multi parametric approach that combined flow cytometric cell counting and 16s rrna sequencing which examined different aspects of microbiological water quality and captured the changes that cannot be reflected by single parameter studies as the type and composition of nutrients are important for both bacterial growth and shaping the bacterial community elhadidy et al 2016 nescerecka et al 2018 including a detailed analysis of carbon phosphate and nitrogen fractions in the multi parametric approach is necessary to understand the driving force for bacterial growth such an integral multi parametric approach will be especially powerful for comparing treatment plant performance and or diagnosing problems related to bacterial growth in drinking water the objective of this study was to conduct a multi parametric comparison of biological stability of drinking water produced from anaerobic groundwater by ro based treatment ro filtration and post treatment and conventional treatment the integral comparison includes the changes in bacterial quantification and growth potential nutrient concentration and composition and the bacterial community composition and diversity across steps in the different treatment lines based on which the treatment performance was evaluated and recommendations were given on optimising the quality of ro treated drinking water 2 materials and methods 2 1 water samples the kamerik drinking water treatment plant oasen drinking water company

processes is denoted as site remin and has a final ph of 7 8 0 2 the full treatment details are given in table s1 supplementary information water samples were collected after each treatment step in both the conventional and ro based treatment lines the main sampling campaign was conducted in march 2019 where all the analyses mentioned in the following section were performed an additional campaign was conducted in may 2019 where only intact cell count icc and atp analyses were performed 2 2 the multi parametric comparison components 2 2 1 intact cell count icc and adenosine triphosphate atp intact cell count icc was measured using flow cytometry bd accuri c6 fcm bd biosciences belgium coupled with dna staining as previously described by prest et al 2016a in short each sample 500 µl per replicate was stained with 5 µl of a mix of sybr green i and propidium iodide stains and heated for 10 min before fcm measurement using similar settings and gating the fcm detection limit is 103 icc ml which was determined using ultrapure water milli q water merck millipore moreover the size of bacteria was classified between large and small using high and low nucleic acid hna and lna characteristics obtained by the fcm wang et al 2009 microbial intra cellular atp was measured according to the filtration based method described by abushaban et al 2019 using the water glo

bgpmax the blank was prepared by adjusting the mineral content of ro permeate at the laboratory using chemical stock solutions with high purity nahco3 ph of 7 8 0 2 122 mg l hco3 cacl2 40 mg l ca2 and mgcl2 4 mg l mg2 the blank laboratory remineralised ro permeate is denoted as lab remin and was spiked with kh2po4 5 μg l po4 p and kno3 50 μg n l to ensure that carbon was the growth limiting nutrient unless otherwise mentioned ion exchange effluent samples were also remineralised with the same concentration of nahco3 cacl2 and mgcl2 to ensure that bacterial growth is not limited by minerals it is worthwhile to mention that the bgp of anaerobic groundwater agw might be underestimated because of the very high nutrient content e g phosphate and humic substances which might have formed complexes e g with iron when oxygen was introduced during the test and thus limiting the bioavailability of those nutrients 2 2 3 bacterial growth promoting nutrients each water sample was analysed for organic carbon c and phosphate po4 p concentrations liquid chromatography organic carbon detection lc ocd analysis was performed at het waterlaboratorium haarlem netherlands to measure the concentration of carbon fractions as described by huber et al 2011 the carbon fractions were distinguished based on their molecular weight mw and they are from largest to smallest biopolymers proteins and polysaccharides humic substances building blocks low molecular weight acids and neutrals the reporting limit of lc ocd analysis is 100 μg c l for biopolymers and 200 μg c l for the other

tartrate with orthophosphate po4 3 in an acidic medium to form a complex that was reduced to a blue coloured compound by ascorbic acid the blue colour intensity was measured within 30 min by

illumina miseq platform 300 bp paired reads was used for sequencing at baseclear leiden netherlands where the illumina sequencing adaptors were appended to the 5 end the sequencing data is available

alpha and beta diversity analyses were performed using the qiime2 plugin q2 diversity weighted and unweighted unifrac distance matrices were constructed from the phylogenetic tree liu et al 2020 otus with relative abundance in the samples of 0 5 were considered dominant the absolute abundance of selected otus was calculated by multiplying their relative abundance by total cell count tcc obtained

results 3 1 intact cell count icc and atp concentration across treatment lines the trends in intact cell count icc and atp concentration across the conventional and ro based treatment lines from two sampling campaigns are shown in fig 2 and fig s1 where similar trends were observed except for concentrations in the source anaerobic groundwater agw icc and atp concentration in the source anaerobic groundwater agw were 215 40 103 icc ml and 0 5 ng atp l fig 2 which increased by a factor 3 and 28 respectively after dry sand filtration dsf and softening sof in the conventional treatment line where oxygen was introduced in the water thereafter icc decreased along the following conventional treatment units reaching 390 11 103 icc ml in the finished conventionally treated drinking water ctw this decrease in icc was accompanied with a considerable decrease 70 in atp to the range of 4 5 ng atp l after rsf and until the end of the conventional treatment ctw in the ro based treatment line the icc after ro filtration and ion exchange were lower than the fcm detection limit 103 icc ml 99 6 removal which increased to 30 5 103 icc ml after calcite contactors cc and further to 90 1 103 icc ml after tower aeration site remin similarly atp dropped below the detection limit after ro filtration 0 1 ng atp l and remained at this level after ion exchange iex thereafter it increased after post treatment with cc to 2 ng atp l and further to 7 5 ng atp l in the finished ro treated water after tower aeration site remin the percentage of high nucleic acid bacteria hna bacteria within icc decreased across the conventional treatment from 60 after dsf and sof to 40 45 after rsf and until ctw however this percentage increased across the ro based treatment and reached up to 85 in cc and site remin a good correlation was found between hna bacteria and atp fig s2 r 2 0 77 ro based treatment r 2 0 65 conventional treatment remarkably icc in the finished ro treated water was 75 lower than that of conventionally treated water whereas the contrary was observed for atp which resulted in a significantly higher p 0 05 atp per cell value for ro treated water than conventionally treated water average of two sampling campaigns 9 07 10 17 vs 1 71 10 17 g atp cell table s3 indicating different community composition between the two treatment lines 3 2 bgp and nutrient composition of conventionally treated and ro treated water the profiling of the two treatment lines showed considerably different degrees of bgp and nutrient removal the conventional treatment line reduced the bgp by 60 from 1 250 100 103 in agw to 450 550 103 icc ml across the different treatment steps where the bgp of conventionally treated water ctw was 515 5 103 icc ml fig 3 a meanwhile doc decreased from 7 2 mg l in agw to 6 0 mg l in ctw table 2 notably the humic substances which accounted for 70 of doc in agw showed the highest removal in the conventional treatment line from 5 2 mg l to 4 3 mg l phosphate was also considerably reduced mainly during dsf 98 from 553 µg l po4 p in agw to 7 µg l po4 p in dsf reaching down to 1 µg l po4 p in ctw table 2 similarly ammonium was also reduced below 0 02 mg l nh4 n limit of detection by the conventional treatment table 2 the results showed that nitrification was the main mechanism for ammonium removal where ammonium nh4 in agw 2 90 0 10 mg l nh4 n was completely converted into nitrate no3 in ctw 2 77 0 40 mg l no3 n methane which was present at 2 000 4 000 µg ch4 l in agw was reduced to 10 20 µg ch4 l in ctw the ro based treatment showed a substantial bgp reduction 96 from 1 250 100 103 icc ml in agw to 50 12 103 icc ml in lab remin i e ro permeate after remineralisation at the laboratory fig 3b however the bgp increased by 160 after remineralisation using calcite contactors cc and tower aeration site remin reaching 130 10 103 icc ml the lc ocd analysis revealed that all organic matter fractions were considerably retained by ro filtration to levels below the reporting limit table 2 despite the increase in bgp after post treatment there was no detectable increase in any doc fraction by the lc ocd for phosphate a sharp decrease from 553 µg l po4 p to 1 µg l po4 p was observed after ro filtration followed by an increase across the post treatment to 7 µg l po4 p table 2 in contrast to conventional treatment nitrification was insignificant within the ro based treatment line where ammonium in agw was mostly retained by the ro membrane 0 17 0 02 mg l nh4 n in ro permeate and was further removed by absorption in ion exchange resins 0 02 mg l nh4 n this resulted in a low concentration of nitrate in ro treated water 0 23 0 05 mg l nh4 n table 2 methane in ro treated water was at similar concentrations as in ctw table 2 the investigation of the growth limiting nutrient fig 4 revealed that the growth in the examined water types was limited by organic carbon for all samples the difference between the actual bgp i e without nutrient addition to the sample and the c limited bgp i e samples spiked with all nutrients except for carbon was insignificant p 0 05 contrarily the bgp of samples with limited phosphate nitrogen and trace elements fe mn zn co and b was significantly p 0 05 higher than the actual bgp of the corresponding sample interestingly the p limited bgp of site remin was 50 higher than that of ctw and lab remin bacterial community in total 29526 sequences were generated for 22 samples which were assigned to 295 bacterial genera the rarefaction curve became plateaued after 1750 and 650 sequences were retrieved for conventional and ro based treatment lines respectively indicating that sufficient sample coverage was obtained fig s3 library size per sample is given in table s7 which showed that few sequences were obtained for ro treated water due to the too low dna content in the sample the average sequences per sample for the entire dataset was 1400 which was low compared to other recent studies beta diversity the similarity in the communities obtained for the duplicate samples reflected high reproducibility and reliability fig 5 pcoa plot of the present study moreover the plot shows that the treatment shaped the composition of bacterial communities where the observed differences between the three clusters were significant as affirmed using permanova p 0 05 table s4 the bacterial community of source water agw were clearly distinguished from that of treated water especially for the ro based treatment for the conventional treatment the bacterial communities shifted across the steps where water after dsf sof and rsf contained similar communities but different from those detected after acf uvd and ctw for the ro based treatment the communities of post treated ro permeate were closely clustered indicating a high similarity among the samples after iex cc and site remin alpha diversity looking into the dominant otus genus level relative abundance 0 5 among all water samples there were 197 otus assigned to 120 genera as shown in the heatmap fig 6 table s5 for taxonomy information the venn diagrams fig s4 show that no dominant otus were shared between source anaerobic groundwater agw 15 dominant otus and water after any steps in the ro based treatment line iex cc and site remin 14 10 and 33 dominant otus respectively conversely there were three dominant otus shared between agw and ctw 23 dominant otus which were assigned to the class of deltaproteobacteria parcubacteria and omnitrophicaeota whereas the only otu shared between ctw and site remin was assigned to the family of oligoflexaceae community composition the column plots at phylum class and order levels are presented in fig s5 at phylum level proteobacteria was significantly present in all samples irrespective of the treatment where the relative abundance ranged from 10 in source water agw to 20 50 after conventional treatment and 55 80 in water after ro based treatment patescibacteria was more abundant in conventionally treated water 20 60 than ro treated water 5 omnitrophicaeota and nitrospirae were dominant in source water only agw 30 where their relative abundance decreased to 1 19 after conventional treatment and below 0 5 after ro based treatment at genus level otus belonging to families characterised as methanotrophs methane oxidising bacteria were detected in both treatment lines after steps where oxygen was introduced fig 6 4 otus for conventional treatment exclusively after dsf and sof 4 otus for ro based treatment exclusively after cc and site remin among which 1 otu was shared by all table s6 interestingly all 8 otus were assigned to type i methanotrophs that belong to methylomonaceae including methylovulum spp 1 methylobacter spp 6 methyloglobulus spp 2 crenothrix spp 2 3 and other uncultured genera 2 5 otus belonging to the families which characterised as nitrifiers were specifically found in the water after the first steps of conventional treatment i e dsf sof and rsf fig 6 with different relative abundances the otus were assigned to ammonium oxidising bacteria aob e g nitrosomonas 6 and nitrite oxidising bacteria nob e g candidatus nitrotoga 1 and nitrospira 2 10 conversely none of them were found in ro treated water except for a poorly documented otu namely gouta6 belonging to aob of nitrosomonadaceae table s6 the absolute abundance of methanotrophs and nitrifiers after each treatment step is shown in fig s6 the methanotrophs ranged from 3 70 103 icc ml and the nitrifiers ranged from 6 165 103 icc ml both of which were more abundant in both treatment lines after oxygen was introduced there were several genera present in ro treated water known for iron manganese and sulfur oxidation such as sulfuricurvum 12 ferritrophicum 5 leptothrix 5 geobacter 3 and geothrix 2 similarly otus belonging to families of characterised iron oxidisers e g the family gallionellaceae were found in the conventional treatment line 3 3 correlation between nutrients and microbiological parameters the influence of nutrients lc ocd fractions and phosphate on microbiological parameters icc atp and bgp and community composition otus with relative abundance 0 5 was investigated using cca the results revealed that bacterial growth either within the treatment units icc and atp or at the laboratory bgp was strongly correlated to the concentration of doc fractions more specifically building blocks humic substances and neutrals rather than phosphate fig s7a the growth was not influenced by biopolymers and acids because their concentrations were below the reporting limit for all water samples regarding community composition fig s7b about 50 of the dominant otus found in samples were strongly correlated to the concentration of building blocks humic substances and neutrals group 1 whereas 23 were fairly well correlated to phosphate group 2 however no clear trend was observed with respect to which otus could grow on each nutrient fraction 4 discussion the multi parametric comparison approach applied in this study enabled better understanding of the microbiological water quality at different stages of the treatment this approach included measuring several microbiological parameters and studying the relationship between them the parameters included are the dynamics of bacterial load measured as numbers cell count bacterial activity atp concentration and composition 16s rrna gene sequencing across treatment as well as the growth potential of these bacteria in water bgp and the driving factors for this growth nutrients this multi parametric approach was used to compare conventionally and ro treated drinking water as discussed below 4 1 characterisations of bacterial cells icc atp and atp per cell as quantified by cell count and atp concentration bacteria were better retained by the ro membrane 99 6 removal where the values in ro permeate were below the detection limit 103 icc ml 0 1 ng atp l this complies with the fact that ro membrane is an effective barrier for microorganisms madaeni 1999 pype et al 2016 however this superior ro permeate quality could be influenced by the post treatment processes sousi et al 2018 which was also observed in the present study as increased icc and atp after the pilot scale remineralisation calcite contactors and tower aeration units the deterioration of biological water quality could be attributed to practical factors such as bacteria sloughing off the surface biofilm of calcite grains and or packing material filling the aeration tower interestingly it is noticed that the increase in atp was particularly correlated to the increased percentage of hna bacteria within icc for both ro treated water r 2 0 77 and conventional treatment r 2 0 65 which agrees with previous findings siebel et al 2008 liu et al 2013 and can be attributed to the high activity and large cell size of hna bacteria lebaron et al 2001 proctor et al 2018 the changes in hna bacteria and atp across the treatment lines can be explained by the nature of treatment applied for instance the highest removal of hna bacteria by the conventional treatment line 30 occurred within the rapid sand filters where physical retention of larger bacterial cells is more efficient vital et al 2012 fujioka et al 2019 and significant atp reduction could be obtained liu et al 2013 regarding the calculated atp per cell the obtained values ranging from 0 70 11 32 10 17 g atp cell were in line with previous findings of hammes et al 2010 for different aquatic environments average 1 75 10 10 nmol cell equivalent to 8 89 10 17 g atp cell but lower than reported values for bacteria growing under starvation condition up to 30 10 17 g atp cell webster et al 1985 the latter value was obtained for specific bacterial species and might not be applicable to others and these values were calculated based on heterotrophic plate count which would significantly underestimate the cell count and result in higher atp per cell values van nevel et al 2017 comparing the two treatment lines in the present study the atp per cell of the post treated ro permeate was 5 times higher than that of conventionally treated water 9 07 10 17 vs 1 71 10 17 g atp cell this could be partially explained by the percentage of large and active cells i e hna bacteria in each water type 85 vs 40 45 nonetheless the low atp per cell for the conventionally treated water was in line with previously reported values for water after granular activated carbon filtration magic knezev and van der kooij 2004 moreover the composition of bacterial communities present in water could influence atp per cell values eydal and pedersen 2007 as confirmed by the bacterial community analysis members of the patescibacteria which remarkably pass 0 2 µm and even 0 1 µm filters herrmann et al 2019 were more abundant in conventionally treated water 20 60 than in post treated ro permeate 5 on the other hand members of proteobacteria and bacteroidetes that are generally known for large cell size based on fcm findings proctor et al 2018 accounted for 75 85 of bacterial communities in ro treated water 4 2 bgp and the factors driving bacterial growth nutrients the present study also confirmed the effectiveness of ro filtration in controlling the bgp of water because of its high efficiency of nutrient removal 97 carbon 99 5 phosphate which complies with previous studies jacobson et al 2009 park and hu 2010 thayanukul et al 2013 though the post ro treatment caused an increase in bgp the bgp of ro treated water was still lower than that of conventionally treated water by a factor of 4 as reported in a recent study with the same water 10 times lower biofilm formation potential bfp was found for ro based treatment compared to that of conventionally treated water learbuch et al 2019 indicating even higher efficiency in controlling biofilm formation by ro filtration and possibly different growth dynamics between planktonic bacteria and biofilm the increased bgp after post treatment can be attributed to the introduction of growth promoting nutrients during those processes as confirmed by phosphate measurement which increased more than 7 times from 1 to 7 µg l po4 p after calcite contactors as demonstrated by the nutrient limitation tests the p limited bgp of site post treated ro permeate was higher than that of lab post treated ro permeate and conventionally treated water 2 089 103 vs 1 144 103 vs 1 383 103 icc ml confirming again the higher phosphate concentration in site post treated ro permeate compared to lab remin and ctw introduced by calcite contactors though the introduction of carbon was not detectable using lc ocd analysis since the concentrations both before and after the post treatment were below the reporting limit it was confirmed by the nutrient limitation tests where carbon was the growth limiting nutrient before and after the post treatment regardless of the bgp value the carbon limitation has been commonly found in many types of water huck 1990 hu et al 1999 van der kooij 2000 liu et al 2015 prest et al 2016a as observed also for water types tested in this study even when the phosphate concentration was very low 1 µg l po4 p moreover the carbon limitation in all samples was confirmed with the canonical correspondence analysis cca without identifying which carbon fraction was the most relevant for growth where a previous study showed that these bacteria could grow on carbon with different molecular characteristics ranging from readily available to more complex organic carbon sousi et al 2020 similarly the link between the presence of different otus and carbon fractions needs to be further explored 4 3 shifts in bacterial communities the present study showed that both the diversity and composition of bacterial communities were largely influenced by water treatment processes which complies with previous studies on different drinking water treatment processes ivone et al 2013 liao et al 2015 li et al 2017 liu et al 2018 since ro filtration could effectively remove bacteria present in source water the developed bacterial community in post treated ro permeate was completely different from the source this can be used as a control for the observations in the conventional treatment scheme for example ro filtration completely removed the dominant phyla i e nitrospirae and omnitrophicaeota from source anaerobic groundwater however only the strictly anaerobic members of the nitrospirae e g thermodesulfovibrionia garrity et al 2001 were effectively removed in the very first conventional treatment step i e dsf similarly the relative abundance of the omnitrophicaeota decreased across the conventional treatment line because most of the species within this phylum were anaerobic which could not survive in oxygen rich fresh water rivas marín and devos 2018 moreover it is interesting to observe the shifts in methane oxidising bacteria mob ammonium oxidising bacteria aob and nitrite oxidising bacteria nob across the treatment lines the high concentration of ch4 2 4 mg l in source groundwater and the introduction of oxygen during aeration contributed to the presence of mob in both conventional and ro based treatment schemes nicol et al 2003 dispirito et al 2016 only type i methanotrophs were detected e g methylovulum spp methylobacter spp and methyloglobulus spp which is typical for drinking water lipponen et al 2004 the presence of only type i methanotrophs indicates that the residence time of methane within the aeration towers was short as those bacteria are known to rapidly oxidise methane in an oxygen rich environment graham et al 1993 hanson and hanson 1996 since methane is the sole carbon source for these bacteria their presence in the dsf and sof treatment steps indicates that methane was considerably removed in these treatment units resulting in 20 µg l ch4 in the following conventional treatment steps the nitrification activity within the conventional treatment line was clearly higher than that in the ro based line for example the aob e g nitrosomonas spp and nob e g candidatus nitrotoga spp nitrospira spp prosser et al 2014 koch et al 2015 kitzinger et al 2018 were detected in conventional treatment units dfs sof and rsf but not in the ro based scheme the same observation was confirmed by the complete oxidation of ammonium present in source groundwater 2 90 0 10 mg n l to nitrate in the conventionally treated water 2 77 0 40 mg n l table 2 whereas the nitrification activity within the ro based treatment scheme was minimal where aob and nob were absent because the ammonium was physically retained by ro membrane to 0 17 mg n l and further absorbed by post ion exchange 0 02 mg n l without conversion to nitrate lastly the presence of several bacterial genera in ro treated water that are known to be involved in the oxidation of iron manganese and sulfur e g sulfuricurvum ferritrophicum leptothrix geobacter and geothrix hedrich et al 2011 schmidt et al 2014 indicates that these metals were re introduced during post treatment nonetheless the presence of such genera in conventionally treated anaerobic groundwater e g the family gallionellaceae has been previously reported hallbeck and pedersen 2014 4 4 practical insights for managing microbiological water quality despite the influences of post treatment on the quality of ro permeate the finished ro treated water had much lower cell count and bgp compared with conventionally treated water to mitigate the negative influences of post treatment it is recommended to use high quality calcite grains for remineralisation to prevent the introduction of organic and inorganic nutrients furthermore aeration towers should be maintained and cleaned more frequently to reduce bacterial growth on the packing material it should be noted that the current study was conducted with groundwater and the sampling period did not cover the whole seasons the observations might be different for surface water systems subjected to significant seasonal variations for which a sampling program including different seasons is high recommended though the effect of seasonal variations on the analysed parameters was beyond the focus of this study negative influences of post treatment were previously demonstrated throughout the year sousi et al 2020 the multi parametric evaluation discussed above offered an integral understanding of the stability and changes in microbiological water quality between two treatment lines considering the bacterial quantity and activity nutrient concentration and composition as well as bacterial community composition and diversity beyond the simple number of cells and or bioactivity the comprehensive dataset obtained in this study allows in depth assessment of which bacteria are growing and why in each step of the treatment process besides regular monitoring the methodology proposed is especially useful when water quality deteriorates during treatment and remedial actions are required to manage biological water quality although multi parametric monitoring is expensive it is recommended as a complementary approach when water quality deterioration is detected during regular monitoring for the microbiology of drinking water distribution system attributed to its high efficiency in removing nutrients the ro based treatment will be useful in controlling the growth of both planktonic bacteria and biofilm regarding the microbes the comparison between conventional and ro based treatment demonstrated the possible quantitative and qualitative control of drinking water microbiology by using ro membranes as an absolute barrier for cells considering produced water is the seed for the microbes to thrive in water biofilm and loose deposits in the downstream drinking water distribution system liu et al 2018 it could be a reasonable vision to manage the microbial ecology of drinking water distribution systems by introducing probiotic microbes rather than microbial contamination through post ro treatment to occupy the niches and form a predefined microbial ecology wang et al 2013 5 conclusions the following conclusions can be drawn based on this study ro filtration significantly reduced the bgp of source groundwater to an extremely low level of 50 12 103 icc ml in lab remineralised ro permeate which increased again to 130 10 103 icc ml when ro permeate underwent site post treatment despite this increase the bgp of post treated ro permeate was 75 lower than that of conventionally treated water 130 10 103 vs 450 550 103 icc ml carbon was the bacterial growth limiting nutrient for both ro treated and conventionally treated water phosphate did not limit bacterial growth even at very low concentrations 1 µg l po4 p the type of water treatment shaped the bacterial community of the finished treated water some genera were shared between source anaerobic groundwater and conventionally treated water whereas the bacterial genera in post treated ro permeate were mainly introduced during post treatment beyond quantitative assessment the multi parametric approach suggested in this study is useful in understanding and managing microbiological water quality in drinking water

17519,nitrous oxide n2o emissions from anammox based processes are well documented but insight into source of the n2o emission in high rate anammox granular sludge reactors agsr is limited in this study metagenomics and fed batch experiments were applied to investigate the relative contributions of anammox granules and flocs to n2o production in a high rate agsr flocs which constitute only 10 of total biomass contributed about 60 of the total n2o production granules the main contributor of nitrogen removal 95 were responsible for the remaining 40 of n2o production this result is inconsistent with reads based analysis that found the gene encoding clade ii type nitrous oxide reductase noszii had similar abundances in both granules and flocs another notable trend observed was the relatively higher abundance of the gene for no producing nitrite reductase nir in comparison to the gene for the nitric oxide reductase gene nor in both granules and flocs indicating nitric oxide no may accumulate in the agsr this is significant since no and n2o pulse assays demonstrated that no could lead to n2o production from both granules and flocs however since anammox bacteria which were shown to be in higher abundance in granules than in flocs have the capacity to scavenge no this provides a mechanism by which its inhibitory effects can be mitigated limiting n2o release from the granules consistent with experimental observation these results demonstrate flocs are the main source of n2o emission in agsr and provide lab scale evidence that no dependent anammox can mitigate n2o emission graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anammox flocs nitric oxide nitrous oxide emission metagenomic 1 introduction anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox has been recognized as a promising cost effective biological wastewater treatment technology and is an improvement to the conventional nitrification denitrification process due to significant reduction of aeration and external carbon source utilization liu and ni 2015 mccarty 2018 successful operation of anammox based processes requires almost complete biomass retention and the maintenance of suitable environmental conditions for anammox bacteria granulation of anammox bacteria facilitates excellent biomass retention and settleability and a greatly improved capacity to withstand shock loadings strous et al 1999 van der star et al 2007 moreover in conditions of high cell density bacterial communication and cooperation would be strengthened leading to increased bacterial activity kartal et al 2011 this is the reason why anammox granular systems are the most common nitrogen bioremoval processes for industrial sites as well as side stream treatment of municipal wastewater lackner et al 2014 high rate nitrogen removal is another critical objective for the anammox process tang et al 2011 the nitrogen removal rates nrr of conventional nitrogen removal biotechnologies are typically less than 0 5 kg m 3 d 1 jin et al 2008 while for the anammox process it has been shown in a number of studies to exceed 5 kg m 3 d 1 van der star et al 2007 tang et al 2011 phan et al 2017 li et al 2018b however compared to the normal anammox process high rate anammox granular sludge reactors agsr have been shown to have a higher nitrous oxide n2o emission rate kampschreur et al 2008 desloover et al 2011 ali et al 2016 n2o is a greenhouse gas with a global warming potential 298 times stronger than carbon dioxide ipcc 2013 consequently even small amounts of n2o emission would be an undesirable outcome associated with the operation of wastewater treatment plants particularly in an era of increasing concern about climate change prather et al 2015 massara et al 2017 the source of n2o in the anammox process is not the anammox bacteria since its production or consumption is not part of anammox physiology strous et al 2006 kartal et al 2011 nevertheless n2o emission can be observed in anammox reactors under high nitrogen loading rates kampschreur et al 2008 intensive studies have been carried out on n2o emission from one stage partial nitritation anammox pn a reactors and stand alone partial nitritation reactors ail et al 2016 mampaey et al 2016 li et al 2017 studies of the source of n2o emission from stand alone anammox reactors as part of two stage pn a systems especially agsr are more limited distinct types of aggregates are typically present within an agsr the aggregates formed in granular sludge reactors are typically classified as granules or flocs based on particle size distribution arrojo et al 2006 vlaeminck et al 2009 schaubroeck et al 2012 vangsgaard et al 2013 it has been reported that flocs are present in all types of granular sludge reactors and granules are often formed in the suspended sludge reactors suggesting that these two types of biomass aggregates coexist more often than expected innerebner et al 2007 vlaeminck et al 2010 winkler et al 2012 recent studies have suggested that even small levels of flocs can have profound implications for nitrogen removal in one stage pn a granular sludge reactors hubaux et al 2015 however the contribution of granules or flocs in agsr to n2o emission remains elusive in this study a high rate agsr was built and n2o emission during its operation was monitored the relative contribution of n2o emission as well as efficiency of nitrogen removal was assessed in both granules and flocs using batch experiments the alignment of metagenomic reads data with a database of nitrogen cycle related enzymes was used to investigate the diversity and variation of genes relevant to nitrogen metabolism in granules and flocs metagenomic binning and phylogenetic analysis were applied to investigate the microbial community structure of agsr using this information the relationships between microbial community and the n2o production performance in both granules and flocs are described these results improve our understanding of the source of n2o emission in stand alone anammox reactors and will help efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from biological wastewater treatment systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor operation and anammox consortia sampling a 1 25 l plexiglass granular sludge reactor was built which had an effective height and inner diameter of 45 cm and 6 cm respectively the inoculant anammox granular sludge was obtained from the lab of prof huang yong at the suzhou university of science and technology during its operational period 300 days the reactor was continuously fed with synthetic wastewater as described previously van de graaf et al 1996 nh4 n and no2 n were added in the form of nh4cl and nano2 and their influent concentrations were 150 mg l 1 and 180 mg l 1 respectively the volatile suspended solids vss concentration was kept at 27 6 2 9 g l 1 through sludge retention time control the biomass of granules and flocs in reactor were 24 9 1 3 g vss l 1 and 2 6 0 6 g vss l 1 respectively the hydraulic retention time hrt ph temperature and dissolved oxygen do concentration were set as 1 5 h 7 5 0 5 30 c 0 1 mg l 1 respectively anammox sludge samples were collected from the vertical midpoint of the reactor separation of granules and flocs was carried out by pouring the sample into a 1 2 l plexiglass container with a height of 43 cm adding 1 pbs to a final volume of 1 l followed by vigorous shaking after letting the biomass settle for 10 s samples were obtained from either 38 cm or 0 cm from the base to obtain the flocs and the granules respectively 2 2 dna extraction genomic dna of granules and flocs was extracted using the fastdna spin kit for soil qbiogene carlsbad ca usa according to the manufacturer s instructions dna integrity was verified by 1 agarose gel electrophoresis and concentration and purity were determined using a qubit fluorometer thermo usa this extraction was done in duplicate 2 3 metagenomic sequencing and analysis four libraries were sequenced on a hiseq xten sequencer illumina by majorbio bio pharm technology shanghai china to generate 150 nt paired end reads the raw illumina reads can be accessed at the sra with study accession number prjna598059 diamond version 0 8 34 buchfink et al 2015 was used to compare sample dna reads against a custom manually curated database of nitrogen cycle relative enzymes with the e value cut off 10 5 the database contains 13 nitrogen cycle key enzymes created as referred to li et al 2020 kaiju version 1 5 0 was used to taxonomic assignment analyze based on reads menzel et al 2015 high quality estimated 85 completeness 10 contamination metagenomic assembled genomes mags were recovered and their abundance were determined as described in li et al 2018a taxonomic assignment of the mags was carried out using miga rodriguez r et al 2018 open reading frames orfs were predicted from bins using prodigal version 2 6 3 with default parameters hyatt et al 2010 genome wide average nucleotide identity gani and average amino acid identity aai were used to differentiate the anammox draft genomes as described in li et al 2020 2 4 batch and fed batch experiments to estimate the contribution of granules and flocs to nitrogen removal as well as n2o emission weekly batch experiments were carried out in triplicate granules whose average diameter was 1 4 mm were disrupted in an effort to control their diameter to less than 0 5 mm before batch tests biomass samples granules or flocs were diluted to approximately 1g vss l 1 with the anammox nutrient medium then 80 ml of this mixture was transferred into 120 ml serum bottles which were sealed using a butyl rubber septa and aluminum crimp seal the headspace of the sealed bottle was purged with n2 gas to remove dissolved oxygen the bottles were set on a rotary shaker at 180 rpm at 30 1 c the concentration of nh4 n no2 n no3 n no and n2o were periodically determined using chemical analyses see below fed batch experiments were carried out to support the results of metagenomics analysis for the no accumulation measurements samples containing both granules and flocs were incubated in serum bottles as described above kinetics of no consumption by the granules or flocs was determined by adding no 1 5 ppm in the absence of nitrite to identify the impact of no on n2o removal rates in granules or flocs n2o 750 mg l 1 vial consumption was measured in the presence of no 1 5 ppm as well as ammonium and nitrite gas and liquid samples were taken for chemical analyses at appropriate time intervals each experiment was carried out in triplicate 2 5 chemical analyses the influent and effluent liquid samples were filtered 0 45 μm and analyzed for no3 n no2 n and nh4 n using standard methods apha 2005 n2o concentrations in the off gas from the reactor were measured using a gas chromatograph gc2014c shimadzu equipped with a 6 foot porapak q column t 80 c and flame ionization detector t 90 c no concentrations were measured with a model 42i no no2 nox analyzer thermo fisher scientific inc usa the effluent water samples were collected and analyzed by n2o headspace technique as described previously elkins 1980 okabe et al 2011 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance and n2o emission of the high rate agsr a high rate agsr which had average influent nh4 n and no2 n concentrations of 150 11 3 88 and 180 76 6 22 mg l 1 respectively was operated for 300 days the agsr performance during the n2o measurement period after 300 days is shown in table 1 a stable nitrogen removal rate nrr of 4 62 0 15 kg m 3 d 1 was achieved with a nitrogen loading rate nlr of 5 31 0 14 kg n m 3 d 1 the calculated n2o emission factor ef n2o defined as the ratio of n2o n over nrr was 0 57 0 07 which was higher than previously reported lower nlr anammox reactors which had an ef n2o in the range of 0 10 0 20 desloover et al 2011 lotti et al 2014 the total inorganic nitrogen removal tin and ef n2o emission of granules and flocs were estimated using based batch experiments it was found that the flocs accounted for 5 of the tin while the ef n2o of flocs was as high as 6 10 0 38 table 1 however the ef n2o of granules was only 0 27 0 06 this means 60 of the n2o produced was emitted from flocs which only make up 10 of the biomass this result indicates that even low levels of floccular biomass in agsr contributed significantly to n2o emissions 3 2 profile of nitrogen genes in different anammox aggregates abundances of the key genes for anammox nitrification and denitrification were measured using normalized read abundance as a proxy for gene abundance relative abundances were evaluated by normalizing the annotated reads to reads per million total reads rpm hydrazine synthase gene hzsa and hydrazine dehydrogenase hdh are key functional genes of anammox bacteria strous et al 2006 maalcke et al 2016 and their abundances were significantly higher in granules 402 12 rpm and 273 12 rpm respectively than flocs 95 6 rpm and 62 6 rpm respectively fig 1 which was consistent with the expectation that anammox bacteria would make up a greater portion of the community in the granules than in the flocs this result was also consistent with the nitrogen removal performance of the granules and flocs there are two main biological pathways of n2o production in wastewater treatment systems hydroxylamine nh2oh oxidation during nitritation nh4 nh2oh noh n2o wunderlin et al 2012 lancaster et al 2018 and denitrification no3 no2 no n2o lu and chandran 2010 the abundance of amoa and hao aob which are key genes for nitritation hyman and arp 1992 sayavedra soto et al 1994 showed similar levels in both granules 5 0 and 147 3 rpm and flocs 5 1 and 119 3 rpm in comparison the abundance of the gene that encodes the quinol dependent nitric oxide reductase qnor was 2 fold higher in flocs 88 6 rpm than in granules 44 1 rpm however the abundance of the gene encoding the cytochrome dependent nitric oxide reductase cnor in granules 23 2 rpm was as low as in flocs 17 1 rpm this result suggests that denitrification within the flocs was the main source for n2o production in high rate agsr which was consistent with the rate measurements table 1 the n2o reductase nosz encoded by the gene nosz is the only known enzyme reducing n2o to n2 and is found in a wide diversity of microorganisms conthe et al 2018 there are two major clades in the nosz phylogeny clade i noszi and the more recently described clade ii noszii sanford et al 2012 jones et al 2013 the average abundances of nosz ii in both aggregates granules and flocs were as high as 190 rpm approximately 15 fold higher than those of nosz i fig 1 this suggests that n2o reducing organisms which often possess nosz ii are the major n2o consumers in both granules and flocs it has been observed that n2o emission is frequently undetectable in other n cycle systems when the abundance ratio of nosz to nor was greater than 0 9 1 2 lammel et al 2015 liu et al 2019 zhao et al 2020 in this high rate agsr the abundance of nosz was 2 fold higher than nor in both granules and flocs and so it would be expected there would be no detectable n2o emission however this was not observed here and moreover the ef n2o was higher in flocs than in granules table 1 it is worth noting that the abundance of the dominant no producing gene nirs cytochrome cd 1 nitrite reductase was as high as 240 rpm in both granules and flocs which was 2 fold higher than nor values the sum of cnor and qnor in the same samples the abundance of the other no producing gene nirk copper containing nitrite reductase was 24 1 rpm in granules or 45 2 rpm in flocs which was much lower than nirs this raises the possibility that no might accumulate in both granules and flocs no is a potent inhibitor of the nitrogen respiratory chain due to its high affinity for enzymatic metal centers rubbo et al 1996 mason et al 2006 moreover nosz is more susceptible to no inhibition than other enzymes in denitrification carr and ferguson 1990 goretski et al 1990 taken together we speculate that the nosz activity is suppressed by accumulated no which enhances the n2o emission in this high rate agsr to identify the taxa of organisms responsible for no production n2o production and n2o removal the reads assigned to the related dominant genes nirs qnor and noszii from both granules and flocs were identified and then phylogenetically analyzed using kaiju menzel et al 2015 more than 95 of the reads assigned as coming from these genes could be taxonomically assigned fig 2 results showed that over 90 of reads assigned to nirs were derived from proteobacteria for n2o metabolism the reads assigned to qnor and noszii were from bacteroidetes 16 20 of qnor and 11 20 of noszii chloroflexi 0 5 of qnor and 7 9 of noszii planctomycetes 13 16 of qnor and 0 5 of noszii and proteobacteria 57 60 of qnor and 62 76 of noszii which showed the potential for n2o metabolism is widespread in the community therefore it seems likely proteobacteria affiliated organisms are the major sources of no production while organisms belong to diverse phyla are responsible for n2o production and removal 3 3 genome based key nitrogen cycle genes analysis metagenome assembly yielded 30 high quality draft metagenome assembled genomes mags with a relative abundance higher than 0 5 in at least one of the samples table 2 taxonomic classification found that three genomes were identified as anammox bacteria and these were named amx1 amx2 and amx3 respectively table 2 figure s1 when compared to the closest organism amx1 showed a gani value of 88 and aai value of 82 figure s2 these two values are below the established species cutoff of gani of 96 5 and aai of 95 0 varghese et al 2015 cabal et al 2018 which suggested that amx1 represents a new species of anammox bacteria amx2 and amx3 were identified as candidatus kuenenia stuttgartiensis and candidatus brocadia sinica respectively figure s1 s2 anammox bacteria were the most abundant organism in both granules and flocs but their average abundance in granules 27 57 0 57 was significantly higher compared to that in flocs 6 34 0 68 to further identify potential no and n2o metabolizing organisms key denitrification genes were identified in the mags this showed that if a genome contained a no producing gene it was most likely affiliated with the proteobacteria on the other hand genomes harboring nor and nosz were affiliated with diverse phyla figure s3 these results are consistent with the results from taxonomic assignment analysis based on reads 3 4 variation of n2o emission in fed batch experiments it has been reported that in general anammox bacteria use the oxidative power of no to activate ammonium in the absence of oxygen kartal et al 2011 it is evident that all known anammox bacteria species have no forming pathways although some anammox bacteria don t encode canonical no forming nitrite reductases nirs or nirk oshiki et al 2015 hu et al 2019 kartal et al 2010 had reported that parts of the influent ammonium could be removed by anammox bacteria via direct coupling to no reduction moreover recent work reported that anammox bacteria were able to conserve energy and grow by the reduction of exogenous no coupled with nh4 n oxidation hu et al 2019 therefore anammox bacteria are no consumers and in granules where their abundance is high they would significantly reduce the no accumulation mitigating its impact on n2o reduction metagenomic analysis suggested that granules might have lower no due to higher levels of anammox bacteria which could mitigate possible no inhibition of nosz this mitigation might not occur in the flocs due to anammox bacteria making up a smaller percentage of the total however the higher number of gene abundances may not necessarily correlate with higher rates of activity of a given protein thus to provide evidence in support of these conclusions batch test and fed batch experiments were carried out to determine no accumulation and consumption rates and to assess the negative impact of no on n2o removal the concentration of no was significantly higher in flocs 2 9 0 2 ppm than in granules 0 3 0 1 ppm which is the same trend as observed with n2o in batch tests figure s4 fig 3 a shows that no accumulated to a maximum value of 1 6 0 7 ppm and n2o accumulated to 1 8 0 5 mg l 1 during incubation of mixed granules and flocs based on this result no was added to 1 5 ppm to measure the no consumption rates of granules and flocs no consumption in granules 14 71 µg g 1 vss min 1 was significantly faster than in the flocs 5 65 µg g 1 vss min 1 which was consistent with the conclusions inferred from the metagenomic analysis fig 3b incubation in the presence of both n2o 700 mg l 1 vial and no 1 5 ppm showed that the n2o removal was slow in the presence of no in both granules and flocs fig 3c however n2o consumption rates in granules significantly increased to 2 73 mg g 1 vss min 1 once no was exhausted but in flocs the consumption rates remained stable at 1 21 mg g 1 vss min 1 during the whole fed batch experimental period the dissolubility of n2o 1018 mg l 1 at 25 c is much higher than that of no 58 mg l 1 at 25 c therefore the dissolution rate of n2o is likely be higher than no weast 1988 zacharia and deen 2005 in addition the fluxes across the liquid granules interface are dependent on the concentration gradients and molecular diffusion schreiber et al 2009 the molecular diffusion coefficients of no 2 36 10 9 m2 s 1 and n2o 2 21 10 9 m2 s 1 are similar while the concentration gradients of n2o was much higher than no in the conditions of fed batch experiments which suggests that the n2o has a little smaller mass transfer resistance schreiber et al 2009 those suggests that dissolution and mass transfer is unlikely to explain why no was completely consumed before n2o in granules in fed batch test taken together a lower n2o removal rate in flocs could be due to the no accumulation while a higher n2o removal rate in granules was due to the fast exhaustion of no it is possible that the rate of no reduction is higher than those of n2o reduction to mitigate no toxicity thus making the n2o consumption slow in flocs however in this study the conversion rate of no was 5 65 14 71µg g 1 vss min 1 which is an order of magnitude lower than the n2o consumption rate 1 21 2 73 mg g 1 vss min 1 in both granules and flocs fig 3b c hence the main reason for the slower n2o consumption in flocs is not likely a result of additional n2o production from no conversion it is possible the no might inhibit the activity of nosz since nosz is more susceptible to inhibition factors compared to other enzymes in the denitrification process yu et al 2019 further studies targeting the mechanism of no suppress the nosz activity are needed to resolve why the lower n2o consumption rates occur in the presence of no 3 5 implications of this work the high rate agsr is attracting increased attention due to smaller space requirements as well as increased biomass retention capacity and shock resistance lackner et al 2014 ma et al 2016 tang et al 2017 however agsr have been shown to generate n2o but the biological mechanisms are unclear the results described here revealed flocs which represent only a small portion of the total biomass were the source of the majority of the n2o that was emitted the importance of floc in nitrogen bioremoval performance was also shown in a recent study using nitritation anammox granular sludge reactors hubaux et al 2015 these similar outcomes indicate that in granular autotrophic nitrogen removal reactors biomass is best considered as constituting two different sludge fractions and efforts to optimize overall processes should consider each fraction independently it would be interesting to further develop this fraction based model and apply it to ongoing efforts to optimize the operation of these types of systems this work also suggested that the truncated denitrifiers like proteobacteria may be an important source of no which can lead to higher n2o release in flocs in granules the abundant anammox bacteria will scavenge the no mitigating its impact on n2o release hu et al 2019 reported the no dependent anammox phenomenon which was able to consume large quantities of no but did not produce any n2o the results in the present study provide evidence that no dependent anammox can mitigate n2o emission in natural and manmade ecosystems consequently no dependent anammox may be an underappreciated microbial process that contributes to controlling the emissions of both no and n2o two critical molecules in

granules and flocs to n2o production in a high rate agsr we found that flocs which are only 10 total biomass were the main source of n2o emission in a high rate agsr the abundance of nosz was

17519,nitrous oxide n2o emissions from anammox based processes are well documented but insight into source of the n2o emission in high rate anammox granular sludge reactors agsr is limited in this study metagenomics and fed batch experiments were applied to investigate the relative contributions of anammox granules and flocs to n2o production in a high rate agsr flocs which constitute only 10 of total biomass contributed about 60 of the total n2o production granules the main contributor of nitrogen removal 95 were responsible for the remaining 40 of n2o production this result is inconsistent with reads based analysis that found the gene encoding clade ii type nitrous oxide reductase noszii had similar abundances in both granules and flocs another notable trend observed was the relatively higher abundance of the gene for no producing nitrite reductase nir in comparison to the gene for the nitric oxide reductase gene nor in both granules and flocs indicating nitric oxide no may accumulate in the agsr this is significant since no and n2o pulse assays demonstrated that no could lead to n2o production from both granules and flocs however since anammox bacteria which were shown to be in higher abundance in granules than in flocs have the capacity to scavenge no this provides a mechanism by which its inhibitory effects can be mitigated limiting n2o release from the granules consistent with experimental observation these results demonstrate flocs are the main source of n2o emission in agsr and provide lab scale evidence that no dependent anammox can mitigate n2o emission graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anammox flocs nitric oxide nitrous oxide emission metagenomic 1 introduction anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox has been recognized as a promising cost effective biological wastewater treatment technology and is an improvement to the conventional nitrification denitrification process due to significant reduction of aeration and external carbon source utilization liu and ni 2015 mccarty 2018 successful operation of anammox based processes requires almost complete biomass retention and the maintenance of suitable environmental conditions for anammox bacteria granulation of anammox bacteria facilitates excellent biomass retention and settleability and a greatly improved capacity to withstand shock loadings strous et al 1999 van der star et al 2007 moreover in conditions of high cell density bacterial communication and cooperation would be strengthened leading to increased bacterial activity kartal et al 2011 this is the reason why anammox granular systems are the most common nitrogen bioremoval processes for industrial sites as well as side stream treatment of municipal wastewater lackner et al 2014 high rate nitrogen removal is another critical objective for the anammox process tang et al 2011 the nitrogen removal rates nrr of conventional nitrogen removal biotechnologies are typically less than 0 5 kg m 3 d 1 jin et al 2008 while for the anammox process it has been shown in a number of studies to exceed 5 kg m 3 d 1 van der star et al 2007 tang et al 2011 phan et al 2017 li et al 2018b however compared to the normal anammox process high rate anammox granular sludge reactors agsr have been shown to have a higher nitrous oxide n2o emission rate kampschreur et al 2008 desloover et al 2011 ali et al 2016 n2o is a greenhouse gas with a global warming potential 298 times stronger than carbon dioxide ipcc 2013 consequently even small amounts of n2o emission would be an undesirable outcome associated with the operation of wastewater treatment plants particularly in an era of increasing concern about climate change prather et al 2015 massara et al 2017 the source of n2o in the anammox process is not the anammox bacteria since its production or consumption is not part of anammox physiology strous et al 2006 kartal et al 2011 nevertheless n2o emission can be observed in anammox reactors under high nitrogen loading rates kampschreur et al 2008 intensive studies have been carried out on n2o emission from one stage partial nitritation anammox pn a reactors and stand alone partial nitritation reactors ail et al 2016 mampaey et al 2016 li et al 2017 studies of the source of n2o emission from stand alone anammox reactors as part of two stage pn a systems especially agsr are more limited distinct types of aggregates are typically present within an agsr the aggregates formed in granular sludge reactors are typically classified as granules or flocs based on particle size distribution arrojo et al 2006 vlaeminck et al 2009 schaubroeck et al 2012 vangsgaard et al 2013 it has been reported that flocs are present in all types of granular sludge reactors and granules are often formed in the suspended sludge reactors suggesting that these two types of biomass aggregates coexist more often than expected innerebner et al 2007 vlaeminck et al 2010 winkler et al 2012 recent studies have suggested that even small levels of flocs can have profound implications for nitrogen removal in one stage pn a granular sludge reactors hubaux et al 2015 however the contribution of granules or flocs in agsr to n2o emission remains elusive in this study a high rate agsr was built and n2o emission during its operation was monitored the relative contribution of n2o emission as well as efficiency of nitrogen removal was assessed in both granules and flocs using batch experiments the alignment of metagenomic reads data with a database of nitrogen cycle related enzymes was used to investigate the diversity and variation of genes relevant to nitrogen metabolism in granules and flocs metagenomic binning and phylogenetic analysis were applied to investigate the microbial community structure of agsr using this information the relationships between microbial community and the n2o production performance in both granules and flocs are described these results improve our understanding of the source of n2o emission in stand alone anammox reactors and will help efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from biological wastewater treatment systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor operation and anammox consortia sampling a 1 25 l plexiglass granular sludge reactor was built which had an effective height and inner diameter of 45 cm and 6 cm respectively the inoculant anammox granular sludge was obtained from the lab of prof huang yong at the suzhou university of science and technology during its operational period 300 days the reactor was continuously fed with synthetic wastewater as described previously van de graaf et al 1996 nh4 n and no2 n were added in the form of nh4cl and nano2 and their influent concentrations were 150 mg l 1 and 180 mg l 1 respectively the volatile suspended solids vss concentration was kept at 27 6 2 9 g l 1 through sludge retention time control the biomass of granules and flocs in reactor were 24 9 1 3 g vss l 1 and 2 6 0 6 g vss l 1 respectively the hydraulic retention time hrt ph temperature and dissolved oxygen do concentration were set as 1 5 h 7 5 0 5 30 c 0 1 mg l 1 respectively anammox sludge samples were collected from the vertical midpoint of the reactor separation of granules and flocs was carried out by pouring the sample into a 1 2 l plexiglass container with a height of 43 cm adding 1 pbs to a final volume of 1 l followed by vigorous shaking after letting the biomass settle for 10 s samples were obtained from either 38 cm or 0 cm from the base to obtain the flocs and the granules respectively 2 2 dna extraction genomic dna of granules and flocs was extracted using the fastdna spin kit for soil qbiogene carlsbad ca usa according to the manufacturer s instructions dna integrity was verified by 1 agarose gel electrophoresis and concentration and purity were determined using a qubit fluorometer thermo usa this extraction was done in duplicate 2 3 metagenomic sequencing and analysis four libraries were sequenced on a hiseq xten sequencer illumina by majorbio bio pharm technology shanghai china to generate 150 nt paired end reads the raw illumina reads can be accessed at the sra with study accession number prjna598059 diamond version 0 8 34 buchfink et al 2015 was used to compare sample dna reads against a custom manually curated database of nitrogen cycle relative enzymes with the e value cut off 10 5 the database contains 13 nitrogen cycle key enzymes created as referred to li et al 2020 kaiju version 1 5 0 was used to taxonomic assignment analyze based on reads menzel et al 2015 high quality estimated 85 completeness 10 contamination metagenomic assembled genomes mags were recovered and their abundance were determined as described in li et al 2018a taxonomic assignment of the mags was carried out using miga rodriguez r et al 2018 open reading frames orfs were predicted from bins using prodigal version 2 6 3 with default parameters hyatt et al 2010 genome wide average nucleotide identity gani and average amino acid identity aai were used to differentiate the anammox draft genomes as described in li et al 2020 2 4 batch and fed batch experiments to estimate the contribution of granules and flocs to nitrogen removal as well as n2o emission weekly batch experiments were carried out in triplicate granules whose average diameter was 1 4 mm were disrupted in an effort to control their diameter to less than 0 5 mm before batch tests biomass samples granules or flocs were diluted to approximately 1g vss l 1 with the anammox nutrient medium then 80 ml of this mixture was transferred into 120 ml serum bottles which were sealed using a butyl rubber septa and aluminum crimp seal the headspace of the sealed bottle was purged with n2 gas to remove dissolved oxygen the bottles were set on a rotary shaker at 180 rpm at 30 1 c the concentration of nh4 n no2 n no3 n no and n2o were periodically determined using chemical analyses see below fed batch experiments were carried out to support the results of metagenomics analysis for the no accumulation measurements samples containing both granules and flocs were incubated in serum bottles as described above kinetics of no consumption by the granules or flocs was determined by adding no 1 5 ppm in the absence of nitrite to identify the impact of no on n2o removal rates in granules or flocs n2o 750 mg l 1 vial consumption was measured in the presence of no 1 5 ppm as well as ammonium and nitrite gas and liquid samples were taken for chemical analyses at appropriate time intervals each experiment was carried out in triplicate 2 5 chemical analyses the influent and effluent liquid samples were filtered 0 45 μm and analyzed for no3 n no2 n and nh4 n using standard methods apha 2005 n2o concentrations in the off gas from the reactor were measured using a gas chromatograph gc2014c shimadzu equipped with a 6 foot porapak q column t 80 c and flame ionization detector t 90 c no concentrations were measured with a model 42i no no2 nox analyzer thermo fisher scientific inc usa the effluent water samples were collected and analyzed by n2o headspace technique as described previously elkins 1980 okabe et al 2011 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance and n2o emission of the high rate agsr a high rate agsr which had average influent nh4 n and no2 n concentrations of 150 11 3 88 and 180 76 6 22 mg l 1 respectively was operated for 300 days the agsr performance during the n2o measurement period after 300 days is shown in table 1 a stable nitrogen removal rate nrr of 4 62 0 15 kg m 3 d 1 was achieved with a nitrogen loading rate nlr of 5 31 0 14 kg n m 3 d 1 the calculated n2o emission factor ef n2o defined as the ratio of n2o n over nrr was 0 57 0 07 which was higher than previously reported lower nlr anammox reactors which had an ef n2o in the range of 0 10 0 20 desloover et al 2011 lotti et al 2014 the total inorganic nitrogen removal tin and ef n2o emission of granules and flocs were estimated using based batch experiments it was found that the flocs accounted for 5 of the tin while the ef n2o of flocs was as high as 6 10 0 38 table 1 however the ef n2o of granules was only 0 27 0 06 this means 60 of the n2o produced was emitted from flocs which only make up 10 of the biomass this result indicates that even low levels of floccular biomass in agsr contributed significantly to n2o emissions 3 2 profile of nitrogen genes in different anammox aggregates abundances of the key genes for anammox nitrification and denitrification were measured using normalized read abundance as a proxy for gene abundance relative abundances were evaluated by normalizing the annotated reads to reads per million total reads rpm hydrazine synthase gene hzsa and hydrazine dehydrogenase hdh are key functional genes of anammox bacteria strous et al 2006 maalcke et al 2016 and their abundances were significantly higher in granules 402 12 rpm and 273 12 rpm respectively than flocs 95 6 rpm and 62 6 rpm respectively fig 1 which was consistent with the expectation that anammox bacteria would make up a greater portion of the community in the granules than in the flocs this result was also consistent with the nitrogen removal performance of the granules and flocs there are two main biological pathways of n2o production in wastewater treatment systems hydroxylamine nh2oh oxidation during nitritation nh4 nh2oh noh n2o wunderlin et al 2012 lancaster et al 2018 and denitrification no3 no2 no n2o lu and chandran 2010 the abundance of amoa and hao aob which are key genes for nitritation hyman and arp 1992 sayavedra soto et al 1994 showed similar levels in both granules 5 0 and 147 3 rpm and flocs 5 1 and 119 3 rpm in comparison the abundance of the gene that encodes the quinol dependent nitric oxide reductase qnor was 2 fold higher in flocs 88 6 rpm than in granules 44 1 rpm however the abundance of the gene encoding the cytochrome dependent nitric oxide reductase cnor in granules 23 2 rpm was as low as in flocs 17 1 rpm this result suggests that denitrification within the flocs was the main source for n2o production in high rate agsr which was consistent with the rate measurements table 1 the n2o reductase nosz encoded by the gene nosz is the only known enzyme reducing n2o to n2 and is found in a wide diversity of microorganisms conthe et al 2018 there are two major clades in the nosz phylogeny clade i noszi and the more recently described clade ii noszii sanford et al 2012 jones et al 2013 the average abundances of nosz ii in both aggregates granules and flocs were as high as 190 rpm approximately 15 fold higher than those of nosz i fig 1 this suggests that n2o reducing organisms which often possess nosz ii are the major n2o consumers in both granules and flocs it has been observed that n2o emission is frequently undetectable in other n cycle systems when the abundance ratio of nosz to nor was greater than 0 9 1 2 lammel et al 2015 liu et al 2019 zhao et al 2020 in this high rate agsr the abundance of nosz was 2 fold higher than nor in both granules and flocs and so it would be expected there would be no detectable n2o emission however this was not observed here and moreover the ef n2o was higher in flocs than in granules table 1 it is worth noting that the abundance of the dominant no producing gene nirs cytochrome cd 1 nitrite reductase was as high as 240 rpm in both granules and flocs which was 2 fold higher than nor values the sum of cnor and qnor in the same samples the abundance of the other no producing gene nirk copper containing nitrite reductase was 24 1 rpm in granules or 45 2 rpm in flocs which was much lower than nirs this raises the possibility that no might accumulate in both granules and flocs no is a potent inhibitor of the nitrogen respiratory chain due to its high affinity for enzymatic metal centers rubbo et al 1996 mason et al 2006 moreover nosz is more susceptible to no inhibition than other enzymes in denitrification carr and ferguson 1990 goretski et al 1990 taken together we speculate that the nosz activity is suppressed by accumulated no which enhances the n2o emission in this high rate agsr to identify the taxa of organisms responsible for no production n2o production and n2o removal the reads assigned to the related dominant genes nirs qnor and noszii from both granules and flocs were identified and then phylogenetically analyzed using kaiju menzel et al 2015 more than 95 of the reads assigned as coming from these genes could be taxonomically assigned fig 2 results showed that over 90 of reads assigned to nirs were derived from proteobacteria for n2o metabolism the reads assigned to qnor and noszii were from bacteroidetes 16 20 of qnor and 11 20 of noszii chloroflexi 0 5 of qnor and 7 9 of noszii planctomycetes 13 16 of qnor and 0 5 of noszii and proteobacteria 57 60 of qnor and 62 76 of noszii which showed the potential for n2o metabolism is widespread in the community therefore it seems likely proteobacteria affiliated organisms are the major sources of no production while organisms belong to diverse phyla are responsible for n2o production and removal 3 3 genome based key nitrogen cycle genes analysis metagenome assembly yielded 30 high quality draft metagenome assembled genomes mags with a relative abundance higher than 0 5 in at least one of the samples table 2 taxonomic classification found that three genomes were identified as anammox bacteria and these were named amx1 amx2 and amx3 respectively table 2 figure s1 when compared to the closest organism amx1 showed a gani value of 88 and aai value of 82 figure s2 these two values are below the established species cutoff of gani of 96 5 and aai of 95 0 varghese et al 2015 cabal et al 2018 which suggested that amx1 represents a new species of anammox bacteria amx2 and amx3 were identified as candidatus kuenenia stuttgartiensis and candidatus brocadia sinica respectively figure s1 s2 anammox bacteria were the most abundant organism in both granules and flocs but their average abundance in granules 27 57 0 57 was significantly higher compared to that in flocs 6 34 0 68 to further identify potential no and n2o metabolizing organisms key denitrification genes were identified in the mags this showed that if a genome contained a no producing gene it was most likely affiliated with the proteobacteria on the other hand genomes harboring nor and nosz were affiliated with diverse phyla figure s3 these results are consistent with the results from taxonomic assignment analysis based on reads 3 4 variation of n2o emission in fed batch experiments it has been reported that in general anammox bacteria use the oxidative power of no to activate ammonium in the absence of oxygen kartal et al 2011 it is evident that all known anammox bacteria species have no forming pathways although some anammox bacteria don t encode canonical no forming nitrite reductases nirs or nirk oshiki et al 2015 hu et al 2019 kartal et al 2010 had reported that parts of the influent ammonium could be removed by anammox bacteria via direct coupling to no reduction moreover recent work reported that anammox bacteria were able to conserve energy and grow by the reduction of exogenous no coupled with nh4 n oxidation hu et al 2019 therefore anammox bacteria are no consumers and in granules where their abundance is high they would significantly reduce the no accumulation mitigating its impact on n2o reduction metagenomic analysis suggested that granules might have lower no due to higher levels of anammox bacteria which could mitigate possible no inhibition of nosz this mitigation might not occur in the flocs due to anammox bacteria making up a smaller percentage of the total however the higher number of gene abundances may not necessarily correlate with higher rates of activity of a given protein thus to provide evidence in support of these conclusions batch test and fed batch experiments were carried out to determine no accumulation and consumption rates and to assess the negative impact of no on n2o removal the concentration of no was significantly higher in flocs 2 9 0 2 ppm than in granules 0 3 0 1 ppm which is the same trend as observed with n2o in batch tests figure s4 fig 3 a shows that no accumulated to a maximum value of 1 6 0 7 ppm and n2o accumulated to 1 8 0 5 mg l 1 during incubation of mixed granules and flocs based on this result no was added to 1 5 ppm to measure the no consumption rates of granules and flocs no consumption in granules 14 71 µg g 1 vss min 1 was significantly faster than in the flocs 5 65 µg g 1 vss min 1 which was consistent with the conclusions inferred from the metagenomic analysis fig 3b incubation in the presence of both n2o 700 mg l 1 vial and no 1 5 ppm showed that the n2o removal was slow in the presence of no in both granules and flocs fig 3c however n2o consumption rates in granules significantly increased to 2 73 mg g 1 vss min 1 once no was exhausted but in flocs the consumption rates remained stable at 1 21 mg g 1 vss min 1 during the whole fed batch experimental period the dissolubility of n2o 1018 mg l 1 at 25 c is much higher than that of no 58 mg l 1 at 25 c therefore the dissolution rate of n2o is likely be higher than no weast 1988 zacharia and deen 2005 in addition the fluxes across the liquid granules interface are dependent on the concentration gradients and molecular diffusion schreiber et al 2009 the molecular diffusion coefficients of no 2 36 10 9 m2 s 1 and n2o 2 21 10 9 m2 s 1 are similar while the concentration gradients of n2o was much higher than no in the conditions of fed batch experiments which suggests that the n2o has a little smaller mass transfer resistance schreiber et al 2009 those suggests that dissolution and mass transfer is unlikely to explain why no was completely consumed before n2o in granules in fed batch test taken together a lower n2o removal rate in flocs could be due to the no accumulation while a higher n2o removal rate in granules was due to the fast exhaustion of no it is possible that the rate of no reduction is higher than those of n2o reduction to mitigate no toxicity thus making the n2o consumption slow in flocs however in this study the conversion rate of no was 5 65 14 71µg g 1 vss min 1 which is an order of magnitude lower than the n2o consumption rate 1 21 2 73 mg g 1 vss min 1 in both granules and flocs fig 3b c hence the main reason for the slower n2o consumption in flocs is not likely a result of additional n2o production from no conversion it is possible the no might inhibit the activity of nosz since nosz is more susceptible to inhibition factors compared to other enzymes in the denitrification process yu et al 2019 further studies targeting the mechanism of no suppress the nosz activity are needed to resolve why the lower
