23085,the secondary load cycle induced by regular waves of large amplitude has an important influence on the ringing response of offshore structures to understand the mechanism of the effect of local violent water deformation of the free surface around a vertical cylinder on the wave loads the numerical simulations are carried out for the cases of the steep regular waves the numerical wave tank is established by solving the two phase incompressible navier stokes equations the vof method is applied to capture the violent flow with the free surface near the cylinder the numerical model is validated by experimental measurement and theoretical result new characteristic parameters of the secondary load cycle are defined in terms of the amplitude duration and phase the effects of wave steepness relative diameter and relative depth on these characteristic parameters are presented and discussed the results show that the characteristic parameters depend mainly on relative wave height and relative diameter of cylinder while the dependence on relative depth is weak using the fitting method the empirical formulas are proposed to calculate the characteristic parameters of the secondary load cycle in terms of different wave steepness and relative diameter keywords deep wave vertical cylinder secondary load cycle empirical formula 1 introduction with the utilization of marine energy and resources the offshore activity is moving towards deep oceans compared to the fixed foundation on the seabed the floating foundation is the superior construction in deep oceans the tension leg platform tlp is one kind of the popular floating structures which is widely used in the oil and gas production engineering and the foundations of the offshore wind turbine in general the natural frequency of tlp is far away from the frequency corresponding to the peak of the wave spectrum of the local seas however tlp may experience responses of large magnitude in terrible ocean environment which is very suddenly generated at the resonance period this is a concern with respect to very high stress levels within a burst of only a few oscillations chaplin et al 1997 and this phenomenon is named as ringing the ringing phenomenon of tlp structure was firstly recorded in the model tests of two oil production platforms heidrun and troll natvig and teigen 1993 once happened the ringing performance will badly influence the safety of the offshore structure for this reason it has attracted wide attention in the world on the theoretical side faltinsen et al 1995 proposed a third order harmonic perturbation solution in the long wave region which refers as fnv formula malenica and molin 1995 extended this solution to the cases of the finite depth water region for the irregular wave the theories were developed by newman 1996 krokstad et al 1996 and johannessen 2012 addition to the theoretical work many investigations have been done experimentally based on the model tests and full scale measurements jeffreys and rainey 1994 discussed the ringing performance in detail and presented a slender body wave model which was validated by the measurements welch et al 1999 did an experimental study of the ringing response of a vertical cylinder in breaking wave groups and spectral analysis was undertaken to explain the physical mechanism driving the response of the structure some numerical results about the ringing performance are also available liu et al 2001 applied the euler lagrange boundary element method to simulate the third order harmonic wave force which agrees with the theoretical results of faltinsen et al 1995 and malenica and molin 1995 bai and eatock taylor 2007 used the boundary element method to solve the fully nonlinear potential flow problem and the results coincide with the measurements it is worth considering that there is an additional loading of short in the direction of wave propagation shortly near the negative peak value in time history in some conditions it is called the secondary load cycle chaplin et al 1997 did an investigation on the interaction between the cylinder and the non breaking phase focused wave the results showed that the secondary load cycle may have an important effect on ringing response besides a strong correlation was found between the magnitude of secondary load cycle and the wave steepness grue and huseby 2002 also observed that the happening of ringing performance is related with the secondary load cycle they suggested that the froude number is a governing parameter for this small scale load here the froude number is defined as f r ω η m g d where ω is the angle frequency of the incident regular waves η m is the maximum value of elevation g is the gravitational acceleration and d is the diameter of a cylinder in addition they found that the secondary load cycle contributes locally to a higher harmonic wave force the timing of the load cycle is about one quarter wave period later than the main peak of the force in the small scale experiments it occurs when the wave slope exceeds a certain value that is for k η m 0 3 and for the range k d 0 66 where k is the wavenumber for moderate scale the secondary load cycle occurs for a smaller wave slope than observed in the small scale experiments paulsen et al 2014 presented the physics of the secondary load cycle they pointed out that the secondary load cycle is clearly associated with the return flow of the diffracted waves which through interaction with the positive flow velocity of the outer wave motion and drives a downstream vortex they also found that the secondary load cycle is higher than the sixth order the magnitude and temporal development of the secondary load cycle are shown to depend mainly on wave steepness while the dependence on relative depth was weak the magnitude of the secondary load cycles was further shown to increase in the long wave regime diffraction theory which is based on the potential theory is widely applied to simulate the wave loading on large objects because it is timesaving and can satisfy the engineering demand in its scope of application the fnv formula faltinsen et al 1995 is widely applied in calculating the nonlinear wave load on a slender vertical cylinder the boundary integral equation method and the high order spectral method for solving the laplace equation have been developed to simulate the propagation of nonbreaking waves in the framework of the potential flow theory liu et al 1992 dommermuth and yue 1987 qi et al 2018 however the potential flow based solvers are limited to a smooth and single valued free surface which means the simulation of the complicated flow such as over turning and wave breaking in the steep wave condition is beyond their applicabilities the numerical model based on the navier stokes equations and the vof method can be used to simulate the violent flows with large deformation of the free surface around a cylinder and to compute the secondary load cycle on the cylinder in steep waves paulsen et al 2014 in order to extend the fnv formula to simulate the wave loads induced by the steep regular waves the present paper focuses on calculating characteristic parameters of the secondary load cycle through a series of numerical experiments the effect of wave steepness relative water depth and relative diameter on the characteristic parameters of the secondary load cycle will be studied the empirical formulas are proposed to calculate the characteristic parameters of the secondary load cycle on a cylinder in regular waves which could be used to reconstruct the time series of the secondary load cycle 2 methodology the numerical model is based on the solution of the incompressible navier stokes equations using the open source cfd toolbox openfoam the volume of fluid vof scheme is used to capture the free surface the finite of volume method fvm and implicit eulerian method are applied for the spatial discretisation and the time integration of the governing equations the piso simple pimple algorithm is used for the solution of the pressure velocity coupling the openfoam foundation 2011a 2011b 2 1 governing equations the navier stokes equations are applied to describe the viscous fluid flow considering an incompressible fluid the governing equations include the continuity equation and the momentum conservation equations in a eulerian frame the governing equations can be formulated as following 1 u i x i 0 2 u i x i u i u j x j 1 ρ p x i x j ν u i x j u j x i f i where u i is the velocity ρ the density of water ν the molecular viscosity f i the volume force and p the pressure 2 2 vof method during the interaction between the steep waves and the cylinder the flow near the cylinder shows large deformation and breaking of the free surface chaplin et al 1997 wienke and oumeraci 2005 deng et al 2016 since the violent flow with the free surface has been proved to be very important for the secondary load cycle paulsen et al 2014 the modelling of this flow is beyond the applicability of the traditional potential flow solvers in the present study the vof method is applied to capture the strong nonlinear free surface motion the vof method was presented by hirt and nichols 1981 and is based on the marker and cell mac method the coefficient α which is defined as the volume fraction coefficient of the fluid is introduced into the vof and evaluated as 3 α α 1 0 α 1 α 0 w a t e r i n t e r f a c e a i r the two phase flow is considered as a mixed fluid the density and dynamic viscosity can be presented as 4 ρ α ρ w 1 α ρ a ν α ν w 1 α ν a where ρ w and ρ a denote the density of water and air respectively ν w and ν a denote the viscosity coefficient of water and air respectively the above variant α satisfies the following governing equations 5 α t u i α x i u i r α 1 α x i 0 in which the compression term takes effect only on the interface due to the existence of α 1 α u i r is the relative velocity between the water and air used to compress the interface weller et al 1998 2 3 numerical wave tank the present numerical wave tank is established using the open source package waves2foam which is a two phase flow package developed from the default solver interfoam in openfoam the numerical wave tank is composed by the wave generating zone the working zone and the damping zone which is sketched in fig 1 for the generation of the incident waves the time series of velocity and free surface elevation obtained from the fifth order stokes wave theory are specified at the inlet boundary in order to absorb the reflected waves from the structures a finite generating zone is developed to damp the reflected waves which is similar with the function of the damping zone approaching the tank end but the incident waves can successfully propagate through the generating zone into the working zone in the present model the relaxation method is applied to update the velocity and the wave surface elevation in the generating and damping zones the relaxation algorithm is formulated as 6 ϕ c ϕ c o m p u t e d 1 c ϕ t arg e t where ϕ is either u or α α is the volume fraction jacobsen et al 2012 guo et al 2012 in eq 6 the weighting factor c is defined as 7 c x 1 exp x 3 5 1 exp 1 1 for x 0 1 the definition of x is such that c is always unit at the interface of the non relaxed domain and the relax domain 3 validation and analysis two cases with different wave steepness are simulated the results of these two cases are compared with the theoretical solution and the experimental data to validate the accuracy of the numerical model besides the differences between these results are discussed the wave parameters and the cylinder diameter are listed in table 1 h represents the wave height l the wave length h the depth of water and d the cylinder diameter an example of the computational mesh is shown in fig 2 the total length of computational domain is 12 l with a 4 l length of the wave generating zone and a 6 l damping zone the transverse width of the wave tank is 60d the cylinder is located at the centre of the working zone the k c number is defined as k c u m t d where u m is the maximum velocity at the still water level and t the wave period in both cases k c 4 which means the viscosity is not important in the simulation of wave force moberg 1988 sarpkaya 2010 therefore the diffraction theory such as the maccamy fuchs formula for linear wave condition the fnv formula for third order wave condition and so on could be used for validation of the numerical model case 1 simulates the wave force on the cylinder induced by linear regular wave fig 3 shows the numerical result of openfoam and the theoretical result of the maccamy fuchs formula the numerical result coincides with the theoretical result quite well it means the present model can simulate the wave force on the cylinder induced by linear regular waves also the secondary load cycle does not show up in this case case 2 reproduces the experiment work of grue and huseby 2002 the wave steepness is much large than that in cases 1 fig 4 shows the measured wave force the fnv solution and the computed value the numerical result agrees well with the experimental data which shows the accuracy of the present model the secondary load cycle appears in both the experimental and numerical results however the fnv formula does not reflect the secondary load cycle as a result there is striking difference near the negative peak value between the theoretical result and the experimental data fig 5 a shows the free surface near the cylinder it presents the over turning performance of the free surface fig 5 b shows the velocity field at the centre of the first layer mesh outside of the cylinder which is the same time point with the free surface in fig 5 a it is presented in z θ plane and the definition of θ is given in the figure it is clear that the flow is violent and complicated when the over turning of the free surface occurs both the highly nonlinear impact of free surface and the violent flow are beyond the applicability of the traditional potential flow solvers finally the validation and discussion show that the present model is able to provide a satisfactory simulation of the secondary load cycle on a vertical cylinder under the effect of steep water waves 4 results and discussion it was reported that the secondary load cycle is one important factor contributed to the ringing phenomenon based on previous works chaplin et al 1997 grue and huseby 2002 the definitions of the characteristic parameters of the secondary load cycle are shown in fig 6 f i i is the characteristic magnitude of the secondary load cycle t i i the characteristic duration of the secondary load cycle d t i i the characteristic time between the down crossing zero point of the wave force and the time when the secondary load cycle reaches the local minimum f t o t a l the magnitude of wave load and t t o t a l the wave period in the case of regular waves on a flat bed the inline force on a vertical cylinder can be considered a function as following 8 f f ρ g h h l d ν t where g is the gravitational acceleration t is the time by dimensional analysis f can be written as 9 f ρ g h d 2 f h l h l d l ν g l 3 t g l previous experiments moberg 1988 sarpkaya 2010 showed that the effect of fluid viscosity can be neglected in the region of k c 4 therefore ν g l 3 is removed from this function according to the definition the parameters of the secondary load cycle are independent on the time so for the case of small kc number the magnitude of the secondary load cycle f i i and the total wave force f t o t a l can be written as 10 f i i f h l h l d l 11 f t o t a l f h l h l d l the relative magnitude of the secondary load cycle is written as 12 f f i i f t o t a l f h l h l d l further without loss of generality h l h l and d l can be replaced by h h m k h and k d respectively which h m is the limiting wave height muir wood and fleming 1969 writing as 13 h m 0 142 tanh k h l based on the above analysis f can be written as 14 f f h h m k h k d similarly the relative value of t i i and d t i i can be shown as 15 t t i i t t o t a l f h h m k h k d 16 d t d t i i t t o t a l f h h m k h k d table 2 lists the detailed parameters of the computational cases for parameter sensitive studies ten cases are simulated to study the effect of wave steepness h h m on f t and d t the relative diameter and the relative depth are constant values which are k h 4 72 and k d 0 472 the region of wave steepness is 0 60 h h m 0 75 using the data fitting method the empirical formulas of f t and d t which are shown in fig 7 can be presented as 17 f h h m k d k h 3 5 h h m 0 6 2 f k d k h 18 t h h m k d k h 3 85 h h m 0 72 2 0 148 t k d k h 19 d t h h m k d k h 2 34 h h m 0 66 2 0 113 d t k d k h the formula shows that f occurs when h h m 0 6 and it increases with increasing h h m t increases with increasing h h m first and then decreases the peak of t occurs at h h m 0 72 d t decreases with increasing h h m first and then increases the valley of d t occurs at h h m 0 66 eleven cases are simulated to study the effect of relative diameter k d on f t and d t the wave steepness and the relative depth are constant values which are h h m 0 730 and k h 4 72 the region of relative diameter is 0 393 k d 1 257 based on the results the empirical formulas of f t and d t which are shown in fig 8 can be presented as 20 f h h m k d k h 0 078 k d 1 36 2 f h h m k h 21 t h h m k d k h 0 13 k d 0 7 2 0 155 t h h m k h 22 d t h h m k d k h 0 11 k d 0 24 2 0 138 d t h h m k h the formula shows that f decreases with increasing h h m t increases with increasing k d first and then decreases the peak of k d occurs at k d 0 7 d t decreases with increasing k d nine cases are simulated to study the effect of relative depth k h on f t and d t the wave steepness and the relative diameter are constant values which are h h m 0 730 and k d 0 629 the region of relative depth is 3 15 k h 9 42 the results show that the relative depth is shown to be of little significance with respect to f t and d t little effect of the relative depth on f t and d t can be found in fig 9 according to the analysis above the empirical formulas of f t and d t can be presented as 23 f h h m k d a k d 1 36 2 h h m 0 6 2 24 t h h m k d b 1 2 k d 0 7 2 0 038 h h m 0 72 2 25 d t h h m k d c 1 26 k d 0 24 2 0 048 h h m 0 66 2 in which a b and c are the factors to be determined the numerical results of different wave steepness and different relative diameters are used to obtain a b and c in fig 10 a the x axis is k d 1 36 2 h h m 0 6 2 and the y axis is f twenty points are pointed in fig 10 a and the slope of the fitting line is a similarly the slope of fitting line in fig 10 b is b and the slope of the fitting line in fig 10 c is c finally the empirical formulas of f t and d t can be presented as 26 f h h m k d 4 5 k d 1 36 2 h h m 0 6 2 27 t h h m k d 3 4 1 2 k d 0 7 2 0 038 h h m 0 72 2 28 d t h h m k d 2 1 1 26 k d 0 24 2 0 048 h h m 0 66 2 to test the applicability and the accuracy of the empirical formulae other four cases are simulated table 3 lists the wave parameters of these cases which are different from that in the above simulation cases the axis set in fig 11 is the same as that in fig 10 the numerical results and the empirical formulae are shown in fig 11 a good agreement between the computed data and the empirical formulae can be found it means that the present empirical formulas are valid in the range of the condition of the numerical experiments on the secondary load cycle however more rigorous analysis and validation of the empirical formulae should be done as the further investigation 5 conclusion the secondary load cycle induced by steep regular waves on a vertical cylinder is studied using the cfd method a numerical wave tank is established by solving the two phase incompressible navier stokes equations the computational model is validated by experimental data and theoretical solution based on the numerical experiments the relationships between the characteristic parameters of the secondary load cycle and the wave steepness relative water depth and relative diameter are proposed it turns out that the characteristic parameters of the secondary load cycle depend mainly on the relative wave height and relative diameter while the dependence on relative depth is weak the characteristic amplitude of the secondary load cycle increases with increasing relative wave height and decreases with increasing relative diameter of the cylinder the relative duration of the secondary load cycle increases with increasing the relative wave height and the relative diameter of the cylinder first and then decreases after reaching a

working zone the k c number is defined as k c u m t d where u m is the maximum velocity at the still water level and t the wave period in both cases k c 4 which means the viscosity is not important in the simulation of wave force moberg 1988 sarpkaya 2010 therefore the diffraction theory such as the maccamy fuchs formula for linear wave condition the fnv formula for third order wave condition and so on could be used for validation of the numerical model case 1 simulates the wave force on the cylinder induced by linear regular wave fig 3 shows the numerical result of openfoam and the theoretical result of the maccamy fuchs formula the numerical result coincides with the theoretical result quite well it means the present model can simulate the wave force on the cylinder induced by linear regular waves also the secondary load cycle does not show up in this case case 2 reproduces the experiment work of grue and huseby 2002 the wave steepness is much large than that in cases 1 fig

between the theoretical result and the experimental data fig 5 a shows the free surface near the cylinder it presents the over turning performance of the free surface fig 5 b shows the velocity field at the centre of the first layer mesh outside of the cylinder which is the same time point with the free surface in fig 5 a it is presented in z θ plane and the definition of θ is given in the figure it is clear that the flow is violent and complicated when the over turning of the free surface occurs both the highly nonlinear impact of free surface and the violent flow are beyond the applicability

previous experiments moberg 1988 sarpkaya 2010 showed that the effect of fluid viscosity can be neglected in the region of k c 4 therefore ν g l 3 is removed from this function according to the definition the parameters of the secondary load cycle are independent on the time so for the case of small kc number the magnitude of the secondary load cycle f i i and the total wave force f t o t a

which are different from that in the above simulation cases the axis set in fig 11 is the same as that in fig 10 the numerical results and the empirical formulae are shown in fig 11 a good agreement between the computed data and the empirical formulae can be found it means that the present empirical formulas are valid in the range of the condition of the numerical experiments on the secondary load cycle however more rigorous analysis and validation of the empirical formulae should be done as the further investigation 5 conclusion the secondary load cycle induced by steep regular waves on a vertical cylinder is studied using the cfd method a numerical wave tank is established by solving the two phase incompressible navier stokes equations the computational model is validated by experimental data and theoretical solution based on the numerical experiments the relationships between the characteristic parameters of the secondary load cycle and the wave steepness relative water depth and relative diameter are proposed it turns out that the characteristic parameters of the secondary load cycle depend mainly on the relative wave height and relative diameter while the dependence on relative depth is weak the characteristic amplitude of the secondary load cycle increases with increasing relative wave height and decreases with increasing relative diameter of the cylinder the relative duration of the secondary load cycle increases with increasing the relative wave height and the relative diameter of the cylinder first and then decreases after reaching a maximum value the characteristic time delay of the secondary load cycle decreases with the increasing relative wave height first and then increases while the characteristic time delay decreases monotonically with increasing of relative diameter of the cylinder acknowledgements this work was jointly sponsored by the national natural science foundation of china no 11632012 11572196 and the

threshold threshold selection south china sea 1 introduction reasonable estimation of extreme significant wave heights is highly important for coastal and offshore engineering practices it affects the design construction installation and operation activities of coastal and offshore structures karunarathna et al 2014 2016 vanem 2016 thompson et al 2017 to adequately determine the extreme significant wave height a reliable sampling method and an appropriate probability distribution model are needed the annual maxima am method dnv 2014 employs the annual maximal significant wave height as the sample for extrapolation ruggiero et al 2010 arns et al 2013 chen et al 2013 vanem and walker 2013 li et al 2016 compared with the pot method the am method is an easy sampling method without additional work the gumbel 1958 model is extensively used as a probabilistic model for working with a sample under the am method castillo 1988 soares and scotto 2001 calderon vega et al 2013 hong et al 2013 niemann and diburg 2013 which may reduce the uncertainty caused by an insufficient number of samples suh et al 2013 hong et al 2013 this method the am gumbel method is a conventional method for the extreme wave analysis jonathan and ewans 2013 xu et al 2016 especially in the field of regional study of extreme values chini et al 2010 perez et al 2017 vanem 2017 polnikov et al 2017 li et al 2018 the peak over threshold pot method goda et al 2001 has usually been employed to identify and select independent peak significant wave heights from initial data mathiesen et al 1994 ferreira and soares 1998 caires and sterl 2005 ambühl et al 2014 liu et al 2018 compared with the am method the pot method is a natural sampling method without additional limitation the generalized pareto distribution gpd model coles 2001 is widely applied to extrapolate return significant wave heights based on a sample of the pot method alves and young 2003 martucci et al 2010 os et al 2011 mackay et

hawkes et al 2008 wang 2017 durán rosal et al 2017 therefore it might generate reasonable estimates of extreme significant wave heights due to its merits of a reasonable sample and natural distribution based on a suitable threshold in this study extreme significant wave heights are estimated in the south china sea scs considering that the scs is a tropical cyclone wave dominated area and these tropical cyclones are major weather systems that drive storm waves liu et al 2008 doong et al 2011 2015 40 year wave hindcast data obtained during tropical cyclones are used as initial data for extrapolation these tropical cyclone waves are only simulated during every tropical cyclone from 1975 to 2014 in the scs the pot method and the am method are used to extract the sample from initial data and the gpd model and the gumbel model are used to extrapolate significant wave heights for different return periods respectively to assess the feasibility of candidate thresholds and select the suitable threshold the analysis of the sensitivity of the return significant wave height to the threshold is presented through studying this method the influence of the excluded samples on the return significant wave height can be found thus a stable threshold range covering the suitable threshold can be found the asymptotic tail approximation and the estimation uncertainty of the pot gpd method reveal that the selected threshold is reliable considering that the sampling method is a basic for assessment of extreme significant wave heights applicability of two sampling methods in the scs is investigated based on the sampling theory and the characteristic of hindcasted significant wave heights of tropical cyclone waves in previous studies you and callaghan 2012 shao et al 2017 the deficiency of the am method for an insufficient number of samples has commonly been accepted however as shown by the presented study that the sample of the am method may be unreasonable when the return period is close to the size of the database due to the characteristic of hindcasted significant wave heights of tropical cyclone waves the distribution and representative of the sample the

sites is presented in section 3 in section 4 the pot gpd method is performed in the scs and the analysis of the sensitivity of the return significant wave height to the threshold is presented for threshold selection applicability of the pot method and the am method for hindcasted significant wave heights of tropical cyclone waves is investigated in section 5 finally the conclusions are presented in section 6 2 background 2 1 pot gpd method the pot method extracts a series of independent peak significant wave heights above a threshold as the sample extract n peak significant wave heights x 1 x 2 x n with common distribution function f x as the initial sample from the initial database under an independent and identically distributed assumption for a threshold u that is sufficiently large the distribution of the peak excess over the threshold i e y x u is given by 1 g y p y y x u f u y f u 1 f u thus the unconditional distribution f x can be expressed in terms of g y 2 f x 1 p u p u g y where p u 1 f u is the probability of threshold exceedance according to the study of pickands 1975 the distribution g y for peak excesses over the threshold can be approximated by a member of the gpd 3 g u y 1 1 k y σ 1 k k 0 1 exp y σ k 0 where σ is the scale parameter and k is the shape parameter these gpd parameters σ and k are estimated using the maximum likelihood

directly extracts the annual maximal significant wave heights as the sample the widely used probabilistic model for working with a sample under the am method is the gumbel model gumbel 1958 the distribution function of the gumbel model can be defined as follows 9 f x exp e x p x β α where β represents the location parameter and α represents the scale parameter these parameters β and α are estimated using the maximum likelihood estimation method embrechts et al 1997 the i year return level is defined as follows 10 x i β α y i where y i ln ln 1 1 i 3 initial data and study sites 3 1 initial data the dataset analysed in this study consists of a wave hindcast dataset of tropical cyclones in the scs and is evaluated using the third generation spectral wind wave model swan an acronym for simulating waves nearshore this model can simulate the growth decay and transformation of wind generated waves and swells during tropical cyclones to avoid the influence of boundary conditions a wider area than the scs is selected as the computational area at 0 n 40 n and 100 e 150 e shown in fig 1 the space resolution is 0 0625 for both longitude and latitude the directional space is resolved in 48 equal directions in the frequency space the number of frequencies is 36 with a minimal frequency of 0 03 hz and a maximal frequency of 1 hz both linear and exponential growths of waves by winds are included in the model cavaleri and rizzoli 1981 snyder et al 1981 dissipation due to depth induced wave breaking is treated by the spectral formulation of battjes and janssen 1978 with α

interactions are activated using the lumped triad approximation lta of eldeberky 1996 the modelling period is 1975 2014 with the time step of 600 s 974 tropical cyclone waves are simulated independently and are output every hour the bathymetric data are obtained from the general bathymetric chart of the oceans gebco the winds used to drive waves are represented by the blended wind speed

significant wave heights obtained via numerical modelling are compared with observed significant wave heights at 7 buoy locations shown in fig 1 in table 1 detailed information latitude longitude water depth and time period for buoys and the names of tropical cyclones that occurred within the time period of the buoys are provided these buoys recorded hourly wave parameters wind parameters and pressure parameters fig 2 shows time series comparisons of simulated significant wave heights and measured significant wave heights recorded at buoy b1 during tropical cyclone doksuri in 2012 at buoys b2 and b3 during tropical cyclone kai tak in 2012 and at buoy b5 during tropical cyclone soulik in 2013 fig 3 a shows a scatter plot of simulated significant wave heights against measured significant wave heights recorded at buoy b1 during tropical cyclone doksuri in 2012 at buoys b2 and b3 during tropical cyclone kai tak in 2012 at buoy b4 during tropical cyclones neoguri rammasun and matmo in 2014 at buoy b5 during tropical cyclones leepi bebinca rumbia soulik cimaron jebi and mangkhut in 2013 and at buoys b6 and b7 during tropical cyclone soulik in 2013 fig 3 b shows a scatter plot of simulated peak significant wave heights against measured peak significant wave heights during the above 12 tropical cyclones at 7 buoy locations it can be observed that the simulated significant wave heights match observed data well demonstrating the reliability of the modelling results furthermore validation statistics root mean square error rmse scatter index si and bias defined by eq 13 eq 14 and eq 15 respectively for the simulated significant wave heights are presented in table 2 the rmse si and bias values for the simulated significant wave heights are 0 434 m 0 182 and 0 091 m respectively the rmse si and bias values for the simulated peak significant wave heights are 0 364 m 0 069 and 0 025 m respectively these results also show the reliability of the simulated significant wave heights the difference between the hindcasted significant wave height and the measured significant wave height exists however this difference is caused by the same bathymetric database the same wind field the same wave model and the same set for wave simulation thus the database of significant wave heights should be reliable for studying and analysing extreme significant wave heights 13 r m

value of measured significant wave heights 3 2 study sites because tropical cyclones are the major extreme weather system driving storm waves in the scs the hindcasted significant wave height of tropical cyclone waves represents the extreme waves in the scs and can be used to extrapolate the significant wave height in this study the hourly significant wave height of tropical cyclone waves 1975 2014 simulated at study sites s1 s2 s3 s4 and s5 in the study region at 15 n 24 n and 105 e 120 e shown in fig 4 is used to assess the extreme significant wave heights a tropical cyclone was recorded if the distance between the centre of the tropical cyclone and the study site was within 300 km detailed information including latitudes longitudes water depth and the number of tropical cyclones is provided in table 3 it can be observed that the number of tropical cyclones for study sites of s1 s2 s3 s4 and s5 is 328 390 334 291 and 314 respectively the mean number of tropical cyclones for study sites of s1 s2 s3 s4 and s5 is 8 2 9 75 8 35 7 275 and 7 85 respectively 4 analysis of the pot method before selecting the suitable threshold an independent and identically distributed wave dataset should be prepared as the initial sample from the initial database in this study tropical cyclone waves are simulated under the same type of meteorological event and are simulated independently for every tropical cyclone from 1975 to 2014 therefore the independent and identically distributed characteristic of the initial sample can be guaranteed and the peak significant wave height of every tropical cyclone wave can directly be extracted as the initial sample from the initial database for example 328 390 334 291 and 314 peak significant wave heights are extracted as the initial sample at study sites of s1 s2 s3 s4 and s5 respectively threshold selection plays a significant role in the pot method which determines the sample extracted from the initial sample and highly influences return significant wave heights of the pot gpd method a lower threshold is likely to provide more samples for the probability distribution model however small wave data are also included in the sample leading to lower representativeness of extreme waves and underestimation of return significant wave heights thus the distribution estimates have a low variance but large bias in contrast a higher threshold will ensure representativeness of extreme waves however the number of the remaining sample is small leading to greater uncertainty in return significant wave heights which means that the return significant wave heights are outside the reasonable and stable range of return significant wave heights thus the distribution estimates have a greater variance but less bias in this study based on analysing the sensitivity of the return significant wave height to the threshold a suitable threshold for sampling can be found this method can be used to test rationality of the candidate thresholds and select a suitable threshold by studying the influence of the excluded samples on the return significant wave height as shown by eqs 4 and 8 the return significant wave height for a specific return period is dependent on the threshold and the sample the number and value of samples by analysing the return significant wave height with an increasing threshold there are two possibilities leading to the variation of the return significant wave height the first one is that the threshold increases meanwhile no peak significant wave height is excluded from the sample p1 the second one is that the threshold increases meanwhile some peak significant wave heights are excluded from the sample p2 it can easily be found that p2 is more important for the analysis of the sensitivity of the return significant wave height to the threshold and the exclusion of the suitable sample the value of the sample is sufficiently high will not obviously affect the return significant wave height when the number of samples is sufficiently large for extrapolation to properly analyse the sensitivity of the return significant wave height to the threshold a reasonable threshold interval δ u must first be determined too small a threshold interval is likely to make the mean number of excluded samples as small as possible thus a detailed analysis of the influence of every excluded sample on the return significant wave height can be achieved however the frequency of p1 is too large which obstructs the analysis of the influence of the excluded sample on the return significant wave height too large a threshold interval is likely to decrease the frequency of p1 thus the influence of p1 is weakened however the mean number of excluded samples is too large and the influence of some excluded samples on the return significant wave height is therefore neglected in table 4 statistics for setting the threshold interval at site s1 are presented as shown by it the threshold interval of 0 05 m can be regarded as a reasonable threshold interval for the analysis of the sensitivity of the return significant wave height to the threshold the frequency of p1 26 and the mean number of excluded samples 2 37 are accepted for study sites of s2 s3 s4 and s5 the conclusions are similar to that for site s1 thus 0 05 m is set as the threshold interval for studying the sensitivity of the return significant wave height to the threshold in fig 5 the return significant wave heights based on the thresholds varying between 1 m and 9 5 m with intervals of 0 05 m at site s1 are shown to clearly express the characteristic of return significant wave heights the threshold range between 1 m and 9 5 m is shown in fig 5 the corresponding annual mean number of samples is 7 5 and 0 275 respectively fig 5 a 5 b 5 c and 5 d represent the 50 year 100 year 150 year and 200 year return significant wave heights respectively with the approximate 95 confidence intervals the likelihood method schendel and thongwichian 2017 reparametrizes the likelihood in terms of the unknown quantile and uses profile likelihood arguments to construct a confidence interval as shown in fig 5 the width of the confidence interval increases with an increasing threshold which must be considered when assessing the threshold choice it can be observed in fig 5 a that the return significant wave height increases with the increasing threshold when the threshold is lower than 3 3 m within this range smaller peak significant wave heights are gradually excluded from the sample with an increasing threshold since smaller peak significant wave heights are unsuitable for representing the extreme significant wave height their exclusion makes the sample more reasonable although the number of samples is sufficiently large the sample cannot represent extreme waves well thus the selection of a suitable threshold within the lower range 1 3 3 m the relative percentile is 9 52 is inappropriate when the threshold ranges from 3 3 m to 5 75 m return significant wave heights are stable with an increasing threshold the return significant wave heights range from 11 99 m to 12 12 m and the average return significant wave height is 12 05 m it can be concluded that excluded peak significant wave heights within this range will not obviously affect the return significant wave height which means that the sample is stable for extrapolation the value of the sample is sufficiently high to represent extreme events and the number of samples is sufficiently large to extrapolate reasonable return significant wave heights therefore the suitable threshold shows a high probability of being located in the middle range 3 3 5 75 m the relative percentile is 52 70 when the threshold ranges from 5 75 m to 9 5 m the return significant wave height first increases and subsequently fluctuates within this range reasonable peak significant wave heights are gradually excluded from the sample when the threshold increases continuously although the value of the sample is sufficiently high the number of samples is too small to extrapolate return significant wave heights well thus the selection of a suitable threshold in this higher range 5 75 9 5 m the relative percentile is 70 97 is also inappropriate as shown by the above analysis a suitable threshold exhibits a high probability of being located in the middle range the stable threshold range which is validated through analysing the asymptotic tail approximation and the estimation uncertainty thresholds within the middle range and the higher range are clearly more suitable for the extraction of peak significant wave heights which come from the tail however the confidence intervals of the higher range are significantly wider than those of the lower range and the middle range as shown in table 5 the confidence intervals of the 50 year return significant wave height for the thresholds of 1 65 m median threshold of the lower range the relative percentile is 20 4 45 m median threshold of the middle range the relative percentile is 61 and 7 6 m threshold corresponding to λ 1 025 located in the higher range and the relative percentile is 88 are 10 67 12 25 11 35 13 15 and 11 92 19 80 respectively the widths of the corresponding confidence intervals are 1 58 m 1 80 m and 7 88 m respectively the same conclusion can be reached for fig 5 b 5 c and 5 d which is also validated by the asymptotic tail approximation and the estimation uncertainty the stable threshold ranges the middle ranges for the return periods of 50 year 100 year 150 year and 200 year are shown in table 6 by analysing ranges of return significant wave heights and mean values of return significant wave heights within stable threshold ranges it is reasonable to conclude that the selection of the stable threshold range is suitable in addition the stable threshold range shows a law associated with the return period it can be observed in table 6 that the lowest thresholds of stable threshold ranges are same for the return periods of 50 year 100 year 150 year and 200 year which are 3 3 m the highest thresholds of stable threshold ranges are different for the return periods of 50 year 100 year 150 year and 200 year which are 5 75 m 5 25 m 4 6 m and 4 5 m respectively the highest thresholds of stable threshold ranges gradually decrease when the return period increases the reason for this phenomenon is that the lowest threshold of the stable threshold range controls the representative of the sample thus the peak significant wave heights over the lowest threshold of the stable threshold range can represent the extreme wave well and the lowest thresholds of stable threshold ranges for different return periods keep constant the highest threshold of the stable threshold range controls the number of samples and the longer return period requires more samples thus the highest thresholds of stable threshold ranges are different and gradually decrease when the return period increases therefore thresholds within the stable threshold range can be used to extract sufficiently high and large peak significant wave heights as the sample for extrapolating stable and reasonable significant wave heights and the suitable threshold should be determined within the stable threshold range in this study the suitable threshold is selected within a common range 3 3 4 5 m of the stable threshold ranges for the return periods of 50 year 100 year 150 year and 200 year at site s1 the suitable threshold can be set as the lowest threshold the median threshold the highest threshold or the other thresholds of the common range in theory to guarantee the security of the design wave height the highest threshold 4 5 m of the common range is selected as the suitable threshold in fig 6 the quantile plot for the threshold of 4 5 m is presented which shows that there are few differences between the empirical and fitted values from the gpd model in general indicating a good fit for the selected threshold in table 7 the return significant wave heights with the confidence intervals at site s1 are shown the return significant wave heights for the return periods of 50 year 100 year 150 year and 200 year are 12 03 m 12 68 m 13 00 m and 13 21 m respectively the corresponding confidence intervals are 11 33 13 15 11 94 14 07 12 24 14 57 and 12 45 14 89 respectively their performances indicate that the variance in the significant wave height extrapolation is accepted by analysing the sensitivity of the return significant wave height to the threshold the suitable thresholds can be selected at study sites of s2 s3 s4 and s5 after selecting the suitable threshold the gpd model is used to extrapolate return significant wave heights for the return periods of 50 year 100 year 150 year and 200 year the suitable threshold and the return significant wave height along with the 95 confidence interval at study sites of s2 and s3 are shown in table 7 it can be observed that the estimation of the return significant wave height is under an accepted uncertainty in addition the quantile plot for the threshold of 4 25 m at site s2 is presented in fig 7 a the quantile plot for the threshold of 4 m at site s3 is presented in fig 7 b the quantile plot for the threshold of 3 5 m at site s4 is presented in fig 7 c and the quantile plot for the threshold of 4 25 m at site s5 is presented in fig 7 d it can be observed that there are few differences between the empirical and fitted values from the gpd model in general indicating a good fit for all the selected thresholds consequently the suitable thresholds obtained by the analysis of the sensitivity of the return significant wave height to the threshold are reliable and the return significant wave heights of the pot gpd method under these thresholds are reasonable 5 comparison with the am method the am gumbel method takes the annual maximal significant wave height as the sample to fit the parametric distribution compared with the pot method the am method is an easy sampling method and it is used to extract the annual maxima of the peak significant wave heights of tropical cyclone waves from 1975 to 2014 directly in table 8 the return significant wave heights and the confidence intervals of the am gumbel method for study sites of s1 s2 s3 s4 and s5 are presented it can be observed that the uncertainty of the return significant wave heights of the am gumbel method is greater than for the pot gpd method in fig 8 quantile plots for the am gumbel method are presented which show that the fitted results of the pot gpd method are better than those of the am gumbel method in general based on analysing the asymptotic tail approximation and the estimation uncertainty the return significant wave height of the pot gpd method is more reasonable than that of the am gumbel method the differences between the pot gpd method and the am gumbel method can be attributed to two factors the sampling theory and the distribution model considering that the sampling method is a basic for assessment of extreme significant wave heights applicability of the pot method and the am method for hindcasted significant wave heights of tropical cyclone waves is investigated for the pot method the sample comes from different tropical cyclone waves it means that the peak significant wave height can independently be selected the sample of the pot method is reasonable when the threshold is suitable for the am method the sample comes from the annual maximal tropical cyclone wave the annual maximal significant wave height can independently be selected when the annual maximal significant wave heights do not come from the same tropical cyclone wave the possibility of this phenomenon is great in the nature the sample of the am method may be unreasonable when the return period is close to the size of the dataset the representative the value of the sample is sufficiently high of the sample of the am method is uncertainty the am method may guarantee the representative of the sample which means that no small significant wave height is included in the sample and the minimal value of the sample can represent the extreme wave well for example the minimal values of the sample of the am method at study sites of s1 s2 and s4 are 4 74 m 4 06 m and 3 38 m respectively which are similar to those 4 51 m 4 27 m and 3 51 m respectively of the pot method in this case the number and the distribution of samples of the am method are analysed which will be studied at site s1 in detail the annual mean numbers of samples for the pot method and the am method are 3 25 and 1 respectively the annual mean number of samples of the pot method is larger than that of the am method the number of samples of the am method is too small to extrapolate reasonable extreme significant wave heights when the return period is much longer than the size of the dataset when the return period is close to the size of the dataset the distribution of the sample is analysed for the pot gpd method with the threshold of 7 6 m the corresponding annual mean number of samples is 1 025 the widths of the confidence intervals of the 50 year 100 year 150 year and 200 year return significant wave heights are 7 88 m 12 06 m 15 73 m and 18 56 m respectively although the quantile plot shown in fig 9 indicates a good fit for the selected threshold the uncertainty under this threshold is unaccepted the width the confidence interval is too large against the return significant wave height for the am gumbel method the widths of the confidence intervals of the 50 year 100 year 150 year and 200 year return significant wave heights are 5 34 m 6 42 m 7 09 m and 8 24 m respectively which are lower than those of the pot gpd method with the threshold of 7 6 m however the fitted result shown in fig 8 a is unaccepted the reason for this phenomenon is that the minimal value of the sample is much less than the maximal value of the sample and the number of annual maximal significant wave heights is too small to extrapolate the reasonable return significant wave height for example the minimal values of the sample for the am method and the pot method under a threshold of 7 6 m are 4 74 m and 7 63 m respectively which means that the annual maximal significant wave height for one year is smaller than some unselected peak significant wave heights for other years when using the am method leading to extreme data loss under the am method some higher peak significant wave heights such as 9 57 m 8 99 m and 8 92 m are not included in the sample thus although the return period is close to the size of the database the return significant wave height of the am gumbel method is unreasonable for example the 50 year and 100 year return significant wave heights of the am gumbel method are obviously higher than those of the pot gpd method in contrast the am method may not guarantee the representative of the sample which means that some small significant wave heights are included in the sample and the minimal value of the sample cannot represent the extreme wave well for example the minimal values of the sample of the am method at study sites of s3 and s5 are 2 57 m and 2 1 m respectively which are obviously smaller than those 4 04 m and 4 28 m respectively of the pot method some small peak significant wave heights such as 2 57 m at site s3 should not be included in the sample they obviously influence the return significant wave height of the am gumbel method for example the annual maximal significant wave height of 2 57 m appears during tropical cyclone dianmu in 2004 at site s3 in this year only one tropical cyclone is recorded at site s3 however there are 333 tropical cyclones 225 peak significant wave heights occurred within these tropical cyclone waves are higher than the annual maximal significant wave height of 2 57 m recorded in the other years the annual mean number of recorded tropical cyclones is 8 54 for the other 39 years which is obviously larger than the number of the recorded tropical cyclone in 2004 in this study the initial database the hindcasted significant wave height of tropical cyclone waves limits the application of the am method the minimal value of the sample is much less than the maximal value of the sample the number of annual maximal significant wave heights is too small to extrapolate the reasonable significant wave height and the minimal value of the sample may be too small to represent the extreme wave the reason for these phenomena is that the annual frequency intensity and track of the recorded tropical cyclones greatly vary thus the extreme wave during the tropical cyclone is not uniform for every year the fixed sampling period cannot extract the sufficiently large and high significant wave height for reasonable extrapolation it can be concluded that the pot method and the am method have their merits and limitations for sampling the pot method is a natural sampling method without addition limitation the pot method can guarantee the number and representative of samples when the threshold is suitable however threshold selection requires substantial expertise which makes it complicated for the implementation of practical engineering applications especially in the regional study of extreme waves the am method is an easy sampling method without addition work the am method can directly extract the annual maximal significant wave height as the sample thus it can be used to investigate the regional extreme wave distribution even the global extreme wave distribution however the am method cannot guarantee the number of samples which limits its application especially when the return period is much longer than the size of the dataset even though the return period is close to the size of the dataset the return significant wave height may be unreasonable due to extreme data loss under the am method the am method cannot guarantee the representative of the sample and the minimal value of the sample may not represent the extreme wave some small significant wave heights may be included in the sample of the am method which influences the reliability of the am method 6 conclusions in this study 40 year hindcasted significant wave heights of tropical cyclone waves are adopted as initial data to assess extreme significant wave heights in the scs through analysing the sensitivity of the return significant wave height to the threshold the suitable threshold is set as the maximal threshold of the common stable threshold range for different return periods which is validated by the asymptotic tail approximation and the estimation uncertainty of the pot gpd method based on the sampling theory and the characteristic of hindcasted significant wave heights of tropical cyclone waves applicability of the pot method and the am method in the scs is investigated the results show that the distribution and representative of samples limit the application of the am method due to the annual frequency intensity and track of the recorded tropical cyclones even though the return period is close to the size of the dataset the sample of the am method may be unreasonable for extrapolation the pot method can provide sufficiently large and high extreme significant wave heights for reasonable extrapolation when the threshold is suitable acknowledgments the authors would like to acknowledge the support of the china national science foundation grant no 51739010

design construction installation and operation activities of coastal and offshore structures karunarathna et al 2014 2016 vanem 2016 thompson et al 2017 to adequately determine the extreme significant wave height a reliable sampling method and an appropriate probability distribution model are needed the annual maxima am method dnv 2014 employs the annual maximal significant wave height as the

hawkes et al 2008 wang 2017 durán rosal et al 2017 therefore it might generate reasonable estimates of extreme significant wave heights due to its merits of a reasonable sample and natural distribution based on a suitable threshold in this study extreme significant wave heights are estimated in the south china sea scs considering that the scs is a tropical cyclone wave dominated area and these tropical cyclones are major weather systems that drive storm waves liu et al 2008 doong et al 2011 2015 40 year wave hindcast data obtained during tropical cyclones are used as initial data for extrapolation these tropical cyclone waves are only simulated during every tropical cyclone from 1975 to 2014 in the scs the pot method and the am method are used to extract the sample from initial data and the gpd model and the gumbel model are used to extrapolate significant wave heights for different return periods respectively to assess the feasibility of candidate thresholds and select the suitable threshold the analysis of the sensitivity of the return significant wave height to the threshold is presented through studying this method the influence of the excluded samples on the return significant wave height can be found thus a stable threshold range covering the suitable threshold can be found the asymptotic tail approximation and the estimation uncertainty of the pot gpd method reveal that the selected threshold is reliable considering that the sampling method is a basic for assessment of extreme significant wave heights applicability of two sampling methods in the scs is investigated based on the sampling theory and the characteristic of hindcasted significant wave heights of tropical cyclone waves in previous studies you and callaghan 2012 shao et al 2017 the deficiency of the am method for an insufficient number of samples has commonly been accepted however as shown by the presented study that the sample of the am method may be unreasonable when the return period is close to the size of the database due to the characteristic of hindcasted significant wave heights of tropical cyclone waves the distribution and representative of the sample the

presented in section 6 2 background 2 1 pot gpd method the pot method extracts a series of independent peak significant wave heights above a threshold as the sample extract n peak significant wave heights x 1 x 2 x n with common distribution function f x as the initial sample from the initial database under an independent and identically distributed assumption for a threshold u that is sufficiently large the distribution of the peak excess over the threshold i e y x u is given by 1 g y p y y x u f u y f u 1 f u thus the unconditional distribution f x can be expressed in terms of g y 2 f x 1 p u p u g y where p u 1 f u is the probability of threshold exceedance according to the study of pickands 1975 the distribution g y for peak excesses over the threshold can be approximated by a member of the gpd 3 g u y 1 1 k y σ 1 k k 0 1 exp y σ k 0 where σ is the scale parameter and k is the shape parameter these gpd parameters σ and k are estimated using the maximum likelihood

directly extracts the annual maximal significant wave heights as the sample the widely used probabilistic model for working with a sample under the am method is the gumbel model gumbel 1958 the distribution function of the gumbel model can be defined as follows 9 f x exp e x p x β α where β represents the location parameter and α represents the scale parameter these parameters β and α are estimated using the maximum likelihood estimation method embrechts et al 1997 the i year return level is defined as follows 10 x i β α y i where y i ln ln 1 1 i 3 initial data and study sites 3 1 initial data the dataset analysed in this study consists of a wave hindcast dataset of tropical cyclones in the scs and is evaluated using the third generation spectral wind wave model swan an acronym for simulating waves nearshore this model can simulate the growth decay and transformation of wind generated waves and swells during tropical cyclones to avoid the influence of boundary conditions a wider area than the scs is selected as the computational area at 0 n 40 n and 100 e 150 e shown in fig 1 the space resolution is 0 0625 for both longitude and latitude the directional space is resolved in 48 equal directions in the frequency space the number of frequencies is 36 with a minimal frequency of 0 03 hz and a maximal frequency of 1 hz both linear and exponential growths of waves by winds are included in the model cavaleri and rizzoli 1981 snyder et al 1981 dissipation due to depth induced wave breaking is treated by the spectral formulation of battjes and janssen 1978 with α

interactions are activated using the lumped triad approximation lta of eldeberky 1996 the modelling period is 1975 2014 with the time step of 600 s 974 tropical cyclone waves are simulated

significant wave heights obtained via numerical modelling are compared with observed significant wave heights at 7 buoy locations shown in fig 1 in table 1 detailed information latitude longitude water depth and time period for buoys and the names of tropical cyclones that occurred within the time period of the buoys are provided these buoys recorded hourly wave parameters wind parameters and pressure parameters fig 2 shows time series comparisons of simulated significant wave heights and measured significant wave heights recorded at buoy b1 during tropical cyclone doksuri in 2012 at buoys b2 and b3 during tropical cyclone kai tak in 2012 and at buoy b5 during tropical cyclone soulik in 2013 fig 3 a shows a scatter plot of simulated significant wave heights against measured significant wave heights recorded at buoy b1 during tropical cyclone doksuri in 2012 at buoys b2 and b3 during tropical cyclone kai tak in 2012 at buoy b4 during tropical cyclones neoguri rammasun and matmo in 2014 at buoy b5 during tropical cyclones leepi bebinca rumbia soulik cimaron jebi and mangkhut in 2013 and at buoys b6 and b7 during tropical cyclone soulik in 2013 fig 3 b shows a scatter plot of simulated peak significant wave heights against measured peak significant wave heights during the above 12 tropical cyclones at 7 buoy locations it can be observed that the simulated significant wave heights match observed data well demonstrating the reliability of the modelling results furthermore validation statistics root mean square error rmse scatter index si and bias defined by eq 13 eq 14 and eq 15 respectively for the simulated significant wave heights are presented in table 2 the rmse si and bias values for the simulated significant wave heights are 0 434 m 0 182 and 0 091 m respectively the rmse si and bias values for the simulated peak significant wave heights are 0 364 m 0 069 and 0 025 m respectively these results also show the reliability of the simulated significant wave heights the difference between the hindcasted significant wave height and the measured significant wave height exists however this difference is caused by the same bathymetric database the same wind field the same wave model and the same set for wave simulation thus the database of significant wave heights should be reliable for studying and analysing extreme significant wave heights 13 r m

value of measured significant wave heights 3 2 study sites because tropical cyclones are the major extreme weather system driving storm waves in the scs the hindcasted significant wave height of tropical cyclone waves represents the extreme waves in the scs and can be used to extrapolate the significant wave height in this study the hourly significant wave height of tropical cyclone waves 1975 2014 simulated at study sites s1 s2 s3 s4 and s5 in the study region at 15 n 24 n and 105 e 120 e shown in fig 4 is used to assess the extreme significant wave heights a tropical cyclone was recorded if the distance between the centre of the tropical cyclone and the study site was within 300 km detailed information including latitudes longitudes water depth and the number of tropical cyclones is provided in table 3 it can be observed that the number of tropical cyclones for study sites of s1 s2 s3 s4 and s5 is 328 390 334 291 and 314 respectively the mean number of tropical cyclones for study sites of s1 s2 s3 s4 and s5 is 8 2 9 75 8 35 7 275 and 7 85 respectively 4 analysis of the pot method before selecting the suitable threshold an independent and identically distributed wave dataset should be prepared as the initial sample from the initial database in this study tropical cyclone waves are simulated under the same type of meteorological event and are simulated independently for every tropical cyclone from 1975 to 2014 therefore the independent and identically distributed characteristic of the initial sample can be guaranteed and the peak significant wave height of every tropical cyclone wave can directly be extracted as the initial sample from the initial database for example 328 390 334 291 and 314 peak significant wave heights are extracted as the initial sample at study sites of s1 s2 s3 s4 and s5 respectively threshold selection plays a significant role in the pot method which determines the sample extracted from the initial sample and highly influences return significant wave heights of the pot gpd method a lower threshold is likely to provide more samples for the probability distribution model however small wave data are also included in the sample leading to lower representativeness of extreme waves and underestimation of return significant wave heights thus the distribution estimates have a low variance but large bias in contrast a higher threshold will ensure representativeness of extreme waves however the number of the remaining sample is small leading to greater uncertainty in return significant wave heights which means that the return significant wave heights are outside the reasonable and stable range of return significant wave heights thus the distribution estimates have a greater variance but less bias in this study based on analysing the sensitivity of the return significant wave height to the threshold a suitable threshold for sampling can be found this method can be used to test rationality of the candidate thresholds and select a suitable threshold by studying the influence of the excluded samples on the return significant wave height as shown by eqs 4 and 8 the return significant wave height for a specific return period is dependent on the threshold and the sample the number and value of samples by analysing the return significant wave height with an increasing threshold there are two possibilities leading to the variation of the return significant wave height the first one is that the threshold increases meanwhile no peak significant wave height is excluded from the sample p1 the second one is that the threshold increases meanwhile some peak significant wave heights are excluded from the sample p2 it can easily be found that p2 is more important for the analysis of the sensitivity of the return significant wave height to the threshold and the exclusion of the suitable sample the value of the sample is sufficiently high will not obviously affect the return significant wave height when the number of samples is sufficiently large for extrapolation to properly analyse the sensitivity of the return significant wave height to the threshold a reasonable threshold interval δ u must first be determined too small a threshold interval is likely to make the mean number of excluded samples as small as possible thus a detailed analysis of the influence of every excluded sample on the return significant wave height can be achieved however the frequency of p1 is too large which obstructs the analysis of the influence of the excluded sample on the return significant wave height too large a threshold interval is likely to decrease the frequency of p1 thus the influence of p1 is weakened however the mean number of excluded samples is too large and the influence of some excluded samples on the return significant wave height is therefore neglected in table 4 statistics for setting the threshold interval at site s1 are presented as shown by it the threshold interval of 0 05 m can be regarded as a reasonable threshold interval for the analysis of the sensitivity of the return significant wave height to the threshold the frequency of p1 26 and the mean number of excluded samples 2 37 are accepted for study sites of s2 s3 s4 and s5 the conclusions are similar to that for site s1 thus 0 05 m is set as the threshold interval for studying the sensitivity of the return significant wave height to the threshold in fig 5 the return significant wave heights based on the thresholds varying between 1 m and 9 5 m with intervals of 0 05 m at site s1 are shown to clearly express the characteristic of return significant wave heights the threshold range between 1 m and 9 5 m is shown in fig 5 the corresponding annual mean number of samples is 7 5 and 0 275 respectively fig 5 a 5 b 5 c and 5 d represent the 50 year 100 year 150 year and 200 year return significant wave heights respectively with the approximate 95 confidence intervals the likelihood method schendel and thongwichian 2017 reparametrizes the likelihood in terms of the unknown quantile and uses profile likelihood arguments to construct a confidence interval as shown in fig 5 the width of the confidence interval increases with an increasing threshold which must be considered when assessing the threshold choice it can be observed in fig 5 a that the return significant wave height increases with the increasing threshold when the threshold is lower than 3 3 m within this range smaller peak significant wave heights are gradually excluded from the sample with an increasing threshold since smaller peak significant wave heights are unsuitable for representing the extreme significant wave height their exclusion makes the sample more reasonable although the number of samples is sufficiently large the sample cannot represent extreme waves well thus the selection of a suitable threshold within the lower range 1 3 3 m the relative percentile is 9 52 is inappropriate when the threshold ranges from 3 3 m to 5 75 m return significant wave heights are stable with an increasing threshold the return significant wave heights range from 11 99 m to 12 12 m and the average return significant wave height is 12 05 m it can be concluded that excluded peak significant wave heights within this range will not obviously affect the return significant wave height which means that the sample is stable for extrapolation the value of the sample is sufficiently high to represent extreme events and the number of samples is sufficiently large to extrapolate reasonable return significant wave heights therefore the suitable threshold shows a high probability of being located in the middle range 3 3 5 75 m the relative percentile is 52 70 when the threshold ranges from 5 75 m to 9 5 m the return significant wave height first increases and subsequently fluctuates within this range reasonable peak significant wave heights are gradually excluded from the sample when the threshold increases continuously although the value of the sample is sufficiently high the number of samples is too small to extrapolate return significant wave heights well thus the selection of a suitable threshold in this higher range 5 75 9 5 m the relative percentile is 70 97 is also inappropriate as shown by the above analysis a suitable threshold exhibits a high probability of being located in the middle range the stable threshold range which is validated through analysing the asymptotic tail approximation and the estimation uncertainty thresholds within the middle range and the higher range are clearly more suitable for the extraction of peak significant wave heights which come from the tail however the confidence intervals of the higher range are significantly wider than those of the lower range and the middle range as shown in table 5 the confidence intervals of the 50 year return significant wave height for the thresholds of 1 65 m median threshold of the lower range the relative percentile is 20 4 45 m median threshold of the middle range the relative percentile is 61 and 7 6 m threshold corresponding to λ 1 025 located in the higher range and the relative percentile is 88 are 10 67 12 25 11 35 13 15 and 11 92 19 80 respectively the widths of the corresponding confidence intervals are 1 58 m 1 80 m and 7 88 m respectively the same conclusion can be reached for fig 5 b 5 c and 5 d which is also validated by the asymptotic tail approximation and the estimation uncertainty the stable threshold ranges the middle ranges for the return periods of 50 year 100 year 150 year and 200 year are shown in table 6 by analysing ranges of return significant wave heights and mean values of return significant wave heights within stable threshold ranges it is reasonable to conclude that the selection of the stable threshold range is suitable in addition the stable threshold range shows a law associated with the return period it can be observed in table 6 that the lowest thresholds of stable threshold ranges are same for the return periods of 50 year 100 year 150 year and 200 year which are 3 3 m the highest thresholds of stable threshold ranges are different for the return periods of 50 year 100 year 150 year and 200 year which are 5 75 m 5 25 m 4 6 m and 4 5 m respectively the highest thresholds of stable threshold ranges gradually decrease when the return period increases the reason for this phenomenon is that the lowest threshold of the stable threshold range controls the representative of the sample thus the peak significant wave heights over the lowest threshold of the stable threshold range can represent the extreme wave well and the lowest thresholds of stable threshold ranges for different return periods keep constant the highest threshold of the stable threshold range controls the number of samples and the longer return period requires more samples thus the highest thresholds of stable threshold ranges are different and gradually decrease when the return period increases therefore thresholds within the stable threshold range can be used to extract sufficiently high and large peak significant wave heights as the sample for extrapolating stable and reasonable significant wave heights and the suitable threshold should be determined within the stable threshold range in this study the suitable threshold is selected within a common range 3 3 4 5 m of the stable threshold ranges for the return periods of 50 year 100 year 150 year and 200 year at site s1 the suitable threshold can be set as the lowest threshold the median threshold the highest threshold or the other thresholds of the common range in theory to guarantee the security of the design wave height the highest threshold 4 5 m of the common range is selected as the suitable threshold in fig 6 the quantile plot for the threshold of 4 5 m is presented which shows that there are few differences between the empirical and fitted values from the gpd model in general indicating a good fit for the selected threshold in table 7 the return significant wave heights with the confidence intervals at site s1 are shown the return significant wave heights for the return periods of 50 year 100 year 150 year and 200 year are 12 03 m 12 68 m 13 00 m and 13 21 m respectively the corresponding confidence intervals are 11 33 13 15 11 94 14 07 12 24 14 57 and 12 45 14 89 respectively their performances indicate that the variance in the significant wave height extrapolation is accepted by analysing the sensitivity of the return significant wave height to the threshold the suitable thresholds can be selected at study sites of s2 s3 s4 and s5 after selecting the suitable threshold the gpd model is used to extrapolate return significant wave heights for the return periods of 50 year 100 year 150 year and 200 year the suitable threshold and the return significant wave height along with the 95 confidence interval at study sites of s2 and s3 are shown in table 7 it can be observed that the estimation of the return significant wave height is under an accepted uncertainty in addition the quantile plot for the threshold of 4 25 m at site s2 is presented in fig 7 a the quantile plot for the threshold of 4 m at site s3 is presented in fig 7 b the quantile plot for the threshold of 3 5 m at site s4 is presented in fig 7 c and the quantile plot for the threshold of 4 25 m at site s5 is presented in fig 7 d it can be observed that there are few differences between the empirical and fitted values from the gpd model in general indicating a good fit for all the selected thresholds consequently the suitable thresholds obtained by the analysis of the sensitivity of the return significant wave height to the threshold are reliable and the return significant wave heights of the pot gpd method under these thresholds are reasonable 5 comparison with the am method the am gumbel method takes the annual maximal significant wave height as the sample to fit the parametric distribution compared with the pot method the am method is an easy sampling method and it is used to extract the annual maxima of the peak significant wave heights of tropical cyclone waves from 1975 to 2014 directly in table 8 the return significant wave heights and the confidence intervals of the am gumbel method for study sites of s1 s2 s3 s4 and s5 are presented it can be observed that the uncertainty of the return significant wave heights of the am gumbel method is greater than for the pot gpd method in fig 8 quantile plots for the am gumbel method are presented which show that the fitted results of the pot gpd method are better than those of the am gumbel method in general based on analysing the asymptotic tail approximation and the estimation uncertainty the return significant wave height of the pot gpd method is more reasonable than that of the am gumbel method the differences between the pot gpd method and the am gumbel method can be attributed to two factors the sampling theory and the distribution model considering that the sampling method is a basic for assessment of extreme significant wave heights applicability of the pot method and the am method for hindcasted significant wave heights of tropical cyclone waves is investigated for the pot method the sample comes from different tropical cyclone waves it means that the peak significant wave height can independently be selected the sample of the pot method is reasonable when the threshold is suitable for the am method the sample comes from the annual maximal tropical cyclone wave the annual maximal significant wave height can independently be selected when the annual maximal significant wave heights do not come from the same tropical cyclone wave the possibility of this phenomenon is great in the nature the sample of the am method may be unreasonable when the return period is close to the size of the dataset the representative the value of the sample is sufficiently high of the sample of the am method is uncertainty the am method may guarantee the representative of the sample which means that no small significant wave height is included in the sample and the minimal value of the sample can represent the extreme wave well for example the minimal values of the sample of the am method at study sites of s1 s2 and s4 are 4 74 m 4 06 m and 3 38 m respectively which are similar to those 4 51 m 4 27 m and 3 51 m respectively of the pot method in this case the number and the distribution of samples of the am method are analysed which will be studied at site s1 in detail the annual mean numbers of samples for the pot method and the am method are 3 25 and 1 respectively the annual mean number of samples of the pot method is larger than that of the am method the number of samples of the am method is too small to extrapolate reasonable extreme significant wave heights when the return period is much longer than the size of the dataset when the return period is close to the size of the dataset the distribution of the sample is analysed for the pot gpd method with the threshold of 7 6 m the corresponding annual mean number of samples is 1 025 the widths of the confidence intervals of the 50 year 100 year 150 year and 200 year return significant wave heights are 7 88 m 12 06 m 15 73 m and 18 56 m respectively although the quantile plot shown in fig 9 indicates a good fit for the selected threshold the uncertainty under this threshold is unaccepted the width the confidence interval is too large against the return significant wave height for the am gumbel method the widths of the confidence intervals of the 50 year 100 year 150 year and 200 year return significant wave heights are 5 34 m 6 42 m 7 09 m and 8 24 m respectively which are lower than those of the pot gpd method with the threshold of 7 6 m however the fitted result shown in fig 8 a is unaccepted the reason for this phenomenon is that the minimal value of the sample is much less than the maximal value of the sample and the number of annual maximal significant wave heights is too small to extrapolate the reasonable return significant wave height for example the minimal values of the sample for the am method and the pot method under a threshold of 7 6 m are 4 74 m and 7 63 m respectively which means that the annual maximal significant wave height for one year is smaller than some unselected peak significant wave heights for other years when using the am method leading to extreme data loss under the am method some higher peak significant wave heights such as 9 57 m 8 99 m and 8 92 m are not included in the sample thus although the return period is close to the size of the database the return significant wave height of the am gumbel method is unreasonable for example the 50 year and 100 year return significant wave heights of the am gumbel method are obviously higher than those of the pot gpd method in contrast the am method may not guarantee the representative of the sample which means that some small significant wave heights are included in the sample and the minimal value of the sample cannot represent the extreme wave well for example the minimal values of the sample of the am method at study sites of s3 and s5 are 2 57 m and 2 1 m respectively which are obviously smaller than those 4 04 m and 4 28 m respectively of the pot method some small peak significant wave heights such as 2 57 m at site s3 should not be included in the sample they obviously influence the return significant wave height of the am gumbel method for example the annual maximal significant wave height of 2 57 m appears during tropical cyclone dianmu in 2004 at site s3 in this year only one tropical cyclone is recorded at site s3 however there are 333 tropical cyclones 225 peak significant wave heights occurred within these tropical cyclone waves are higher than the annual maximal significant wave height of 2 57 m recorded in the other years the annual mean number of recorded tropical cyclones is 8 54 for the other 39 years which is obviously larger than the number of the recorded tropical cyclone in 2004 in this study the initial database the hindcasted significant wave height of tropical cyclone waves limits the application of the am method the minimal value of the sample is much less than the maximal value of the sample the number of annual maximal significant wave heights is too small to extrapolate the reasonable significant wave height and the minimal value of the sample may be too small to represent the extreme wave the reason for these phenomena is that the annual frequency intensity and track of the recorded tropical cyclones greatly vary thus the extreme wave during the tropical cyclone is not uniform for every year the fixed sampling period cannot extract the sufficiently large and high significant wave height for reasonable extrapolation it can be concluded that the pot method and the am method have their merits and limitations for sampling the pot method is a natural sampling method without addition limitation the pot method can guarantee the number and representative of samples when the threshold is suitable however threshold selection requires substantial expertise which makes it complicated for the implementation of practical engineering applications especially in the regional study of extreme waves the am method is an easy sampling method without addition work the am method can directly extract the annual maximal significant wave height as the sample thus it can be used to investigate the regional extreme wave distribution even the global extreme wave distribution however the am method cannot guarantee the number of samples which limits its application especially when the return period is much longer than the size of the dataset even though the return period is close to the size of the dataset the return significant wave height may be unreasonable due to extreme data loss under the am method the am method cannot guarantee the representative of the sample and the minimal value of the sample may not represent the extreme wave some small significant wave heights may be included in the sample of the am method which influences the reliability of the am method 6 conclusions in this study 40 year hindcasted significant wave heights of tropical cyclone waves are adopted as initial data to assess extreme significant wave heights in the scs through analysing the sensitivity of the return significant wave height to the threshold the suitable threshold is set as the maximal threshold of the common stable threshold range for different return periods which is validated by the asymptotic tail approximation and the estimation uncertainty of the pot gpd method based on the sampling theory and the characteristic of hindcasted significant wave heights of tropical cyclone waves applicability of the pot method and the am method in the scs is investigated the results show that the distribution and representative of samples limit the application of the am method due to the annual frequency intensity and track of the recorded tropical cyclones even though the return period is close to the size of the dataset the sample of the am method may be unreasonable for extrapolation the pot method can provide sufficiently large and high extreme significant wave heights for reasonable extrapolation when the threshold is suitable acknowledgments the authors would like to acknowledge the support of the china national science foundation grant no 51739010

23087,jacket offshore platform serving in the marine environment is often subjected to severe dynamic loads such as winds waves currents and earthquakes the alternating stress state of jacket offshore platform will lead to the degradation of mechanical properties of the structural steel which results in the decline of the overall bearing capacity in this paper eighteen types of cyclic loading program designed according to the characteristics of the steel and extreme cyclic loads are presented for the first time the hysteresis behavior of structural steel nv d36 under various cyclic loading program is studied the changing process of energy dissipation capacity of the steel under different loading program is compared the hysteresis skeleton curve of steel under variable amplitude cyclic loading is fitted based on the basis of the classical ramberg osgood model the parameters of combined hardening of the steel based on chaboche constitutive model are calibrated the results of the cyclic loading are numerically simulated with the obtained hysteresis skeleton curves and parameters the combined hardening criterion can be used to analyze the responses of the steel under cyclic loading and the parameters can be applied to study the dynamic properties of the jacket offshore platform of structural steel nv d36 keywords marine structural steel cyclic loading program cyclic loading test hysteretic behavior chaboche constitutive model 1 introduction 1jacket offshore platforms are majorly located in a severe environment and usually subjected to crucial dynamic loads caused by winds waves and currents occasionally there are hurricanes earthquakes or other extreme cyclic loads wang et al 2006 extreme cyclic loads such as earthquakes can result in the positive and negative change alternately of structural internal forces under those extreme cyclic loads structural members particularly those acting as dissipative elements will experience small numbers of large plastic deformation cycles in a short time this process that lead to structural members damage or failure caused by small numbers of cyclic loading can be seen as low cycle fatigue kuroda 2002 nip et al 2010 once low cycle fatigue loads such as earthquakes and hurricanes occur jacket offshore platforms maybe destroyed seriously or even collapse health and safety executive hse 1999 in the last two decades earthquakes and hurricanes have caused serious damage to several jacket offshore platforms in service panthaki 1992 ajamy et al 2014 the study on fatigue of jacket offshore platform mainly concentrated on the high cycle fatigue life caused by waves currents and other common cyclic loads but rarely focused on the features of material or structure mechanical properties caused by hurricanes earthquakes and other extreme cyclic loads abs 2014 dnvgl rp c203 2016 besides steel engineering stress strain relation is commonly defined as bilinear or multi linear simplified models in the current engineering calculation kuroda 2002 xue 2008 nip et al 2010 however due to cyclic hardening or softening and bauschinger effect of steel those simplified models have a great difference from the real stress strain relation which are shown in fig 1 shi et al 2011 those simplified methods cannot provide a very accurate simulation on steel mechanical behavior under cyclic loading therefore it is significant to obtain engineering stress strain relation accurately under cyclic loading to evaluate the ultimate state of structure and safety of overall structure many scholars have put forward some simplified cyclic constitutive models such as bilinear model three linear model skeleton model and non linear model to simulate the material in structure under cyclic loading ramberg and osgood 1943 proposed a widely used three parameter model to describe the hysteresis skeleton curve of metal materials jhansale 1977 proposed an inelastic computation model of structural material under complex cyclic loading and described the hysteresis skeleton curve by piecewise polyline krawinkler et al 1983 1985 develop a mathematical model for uniaxial cyclic stress strain behavior of steel assuming the existence of stress bounds which is controlled by hardening softening and mean stress relaxation chaboche 1986 1991 proposed a cyclic constitutive model considering the characteristics of isotropic hardening and kinematic hardening to describe the hysteretic behavior based on elastic plasticity theory the initial yield condition and the flow law have been basically agreed based on the classical plastic theory of the unified system under the drucker 1951 postulate therefore the main difference among the above constitutive models is how to define the evolution law of the initial yield surface hardening criterion generally the hardening criterion can be divided into linear hardening criterion and nonlinear hardening criterion the form of linear hardening criterion is simple and easy to apply but its simulation of the real yield surface is poor the form of nonlinear hardening criterion is more complex but its simulation is closer to the evolution law of the real yield surface lee et al 2009 take the hardening criterion of the nonlinear cyclic constitutive model as an example myers 2009 as shown in fig 2 the hardening criterion can be equivalent to isotropic hardening criterion kinematic hardening criterion or combined hardening criterion the isotropic hardening criterion means that the initial yield surface expands along each stress direction uniformly under cyclic loading the kinematic hardening criterion is that the subsequent yield surface only move without shape change under cyclic loading the combined hardening criterion is the combination of isotropic hardening and kinematic hardening therefore it is crucial to obtain the reliable control parameters of hardening criterion for constructing the constitutive relation of steel under cyclic loading accurately because of the cyclic constitutive model is related to the material properties and processing technology of the steel the control parameters of hardening criterion of the specific steel are usually calibrated by the cyclic loading test generally the test types are divided into shaking table test pseudo dynamic test and pseudo static test low cycle cyclic loading test shaking table test and pseudo dynamic test are the closest to the real loading condition but its strict full size test conditions and high test costs result in such tests are difficult to implement however low cycle cyclic loading test can be easily conducted to obtain the strength stiffness and energy dissipation and other important information it becomes most economically effective method to acquire the hardening parameters and establish the cyclic constitutive relation robert 1996 some scholars have carried on low cycle cyclic loading test to various metal materials and obtained suitable cyclic constitutive relation dusicka et al 2007 nip 2010 shi et al 2011 shi et al 2012 the cyclic loading program of the above test is triangular waveforms but the loading amplitude loading history and the number of loading program are different the cyclic constitutive relation of material is not only dependent on the properties of the material but also the characteristics of cyclic loads therefore it is very important to determine the loading amplitude loading history and the number of loading program extreme cyclic loads such as earthquakes have strong randomness superstition hills 02 seismic spectrum was measured by el centro imp co cent in 1987 and the acceleration time history are shown in fig 3 yang et al 2017 part a is the typical stage of load amplitude increasing and the amplitude is symmetry part b is a reverse loading stage with large amplitude part c cyclic loading in the tensile direction is a one way loading stage the a b and c section is only part of the extreme cyclic loads therefore a rich and accurate cyclic loading program should be designed to reflect the characteristics of the material itself and the seismic loads in the current paper various types of cyclic loading program are designed according to the characteristics of the steel and extreme cyclic loads then we choose the high performance marine structural steel hpms nv d36 to carry out the experimental study under different cyclic loading program for analyzing the monotonic behavior hysteretic behavior and energy dissipation capacity of the steel further ramberg osgood 1943 model is used to fit the hysteresis skeleton curves and chaboche 1986 model is applied to calibrate the combined hardening parameters after the calibration finite element software abaqus is used to simulate and verify the test hysteresis curves the experimental basis is provided for the response analysis of hpms nv d36 steel in the overall jacket offshore platform 2 material and testing arrangements 2 1 material and specimen the material in this study is hpms nv d36 steel which is certificated by det norske veritas classification society dnv the steel chemical composition is summarized in table 1 obtained from the mill certificate the carbon content of the steel is about 0 11 therefore the steel is classified as mild steel the percent of c element is less than 0 25 yield strength and ultimate strength of the steel are 430 mpa and 553 mpa respectively ultimate elongation is 26 due to the different test conditions between steel mill and laboratory the steel monotonic mechanical properties data provided by the mill certificate are for reference only since plate and pipe are widely used in jacket offshore platforms the sheet specimens are adopted in the test instead of specimens with round cross section according to the test standard developed by american society for testing and materials astm 1998 the specimen includes test zone transition zone and clamping position the shape and sizes of specimen are shown in fig 4 in order to avoid buckling while the compressive force is anticipated in the loading program the length of the test zone is slightly smaller than those in the test standard 2 2 test setup instron 8801 hydraulic fatigue testing machine is used for monotonic loading test and cyclic loading test the dynamic load capacity range of the testing machine is 100 kn the strain of specimens in the test is measured using an extensometer with gauge length of 12 5 mm and measuring range of 35 the strain data is obtained from the conversion of displacement results recorded by testing machine when measured strain is more than 35 the data of load displacement and strain in out in the test are recorded by static strain testing machine in real time and the data acquisition frequency is 50 hz the layout of the test setup with extensometer is shown in fig 5 2 3 monotonic loading program three specimens named ml 1 ml 2 and ml 3 respectively are tested under monotonic loading according to the standard gb t 228 1 2010 to obtain the basic mechanical properties of the steel 2 4 cyclic loading program based on the steel mechanical properties and the characteristics of cyclic loads such as earthquakes that jacket offshore platforms may suffer eighteen types of cyclic loading program are designed the cyclic loading program applied to specimens are separated into two types constant amplitude cyclic loading program and variable amplitude cyclic loading program which are named cl ca x and cl va x respectively 2 4 1 constant amplitude cyclic loading program various constant amplitude cyclic loading program is adopted into specimens to investigate the features of hysteresis curves cyclic hardening and energy dissipation capacity of the steel specimens are tested under cl ca 1 4 to analyze the effects of different cyclic loading amplitudes for cyclic hardening and energy dissipation capacity of the steel cl ca 5 cl ca 6 and cl ca 7 are designed to study the steel hysteretic behavior after suffered from extreme cyclic loads suddenly in order to compare and analyze the steel hysteretic behavior caused by initial loading direction before it suffered from extreme cyclic loads such as earthquake the specimens are tested under cl ca 8 and cl ca 9 the details of cl ca x are as follows see table 2 2 4 2 variable amplitude cyclic loading program different variable amplitude cyclic loading program is applied to specimens to find the characteristics of hysteresis curves hysteresis skeleton curves cyclic hardening and energy dissipation capacity of the steel cl va 1 and cl va 2 are set out to obtain the features of hysteresis skeleton curves and energy dissipation capacity of the steel when it is loaded in the tensile direction and symmetrically cl va 3 and cl va 4 are applied to specimens for acquiring the characteristics of hysteresis skeleton curves cyclic hardening and energy dissipation capacity of the steel caused by the direction of cyclic loading specimens are tested under cl va 5 and cl va 6 to analyze the characteristics of energy dissipation capacity of the steel caused by varying in initial plastic stage of the steel cl va 7 is set out to obtain the features of hysteretic behavior of the steel when it is loaded with constant amplitude but yield surface keeps moving specimens are loaded under cl va 8 and cl va 9 to study the features of hysteretic behavior of the steel caused by random cyclic loads the details of cl va x are shown in table 3 all cyclic loading tests are tested at room temperature the cyclic loading program is designed as triangular wave program the strain rate is approximately 0 05 hz gb t 26077 2010 so that the influence of temperature by reason of specimen friction can be neglected once distinctive cracks or buckling appear on specimen the cyclic loading would be ceased immediately after the cyclic loading test the specimens are loaded until failure 3 test results 3 1 monotonic behavior the mechanical properties parameters of steel obtained from the monotonic loading test are the basis of the subsequent test and analysis the monotonic loading mechanical properties parameters data obtained from steel mill and laboratory maybe different hence specimens ml 1 ml 2 and ml 3 are conducted on monotonic loading test respectively since the constraint of measuring range of extensometer the measured strain exceeds 35 cannot be collected by the extensometer accurately we can obtain the engineering strain from the conversion of displacement results recorded by testing machine the strain in the test is directly measured by a tensile and compression extensometer it is known from the working principle of the extensometer that the measured strain is the engineering strain the stress in the test is the ratio of the tensile or compress force measured by the testing machine to the initial cross sectional area of the test zone of specimen which is the engineering stress therefore the engineering stress strain curves of monotonic loading of the steel are obtained and shown in fig 6 and engineering stress and engineering strain can be calculated from eqs 1 and 2 1 ε δ l l 0 2 σ p a 0 where σ and ε represent the engineering stress and engineering strain of the steel respectively δl represents the displacement of test zone l 0 represents the initial length of test zone p represents the tensile or compressive load a 0 represents the initial cross sectional area of test zone theoretically the specimen deformation in the test is large which belongs to the category of big deformation because of the limitation of test method this deformation is still treated as small deformation the strain used in this paper is the engineering strain measured by the extensometer table 4 provides details of the monotonic loading test results the yield strength and ultimate strength are 414 mpa and 550 mpa respectively which are slightly different from the data steel mills provided the engineering strain at fracture strength is about 60 4 which shows the steel has a good ductility the comparison of engineering stress strain curves between monotonic loading and cyclic loading is shown in fig 7 there is great diﬀerence between the monotonic and cyclic loading curve due to the cyclic hardening or softening and bauschinger eﬀect particularly cyclic loading leading to the deterioration of the fracture strain that makes the ductility of the steel become worse but the strength in strain hardening ranges of cyclic loading curve is higher than that of monotonic loading curve 3 2 hysteretic behavior 3 2 1 hysteresis curves the stress and strain in the analysis of hysteretic behavior like the monotonic behavior represent the engineering stress and engineering strain respectively the hysteresis curves and the specific mechanical properties parameters of the specimen under different cyclic loading program is shown in fig 9 and table 5 respectively the mechanical properties of the steel obtained from the hysteresis curves and mechanical properties parameters are shown as 1 the hysteresis curves of steel under different cyclic loading program have no obvious yield plateau 2 after the cyclic loading the ultimate strength of steel has been strengthened and the elongation of the steel has been degraded the degree of change is related to the cyclic loading program 3 the stress hardening phenomenon appeared on the first cycle and strengthened at subsequent cycles gradually when specimens are loaded under cl ca 1 and cl ca 2 under variable amplitude cyclic loading program the specimens are loaded to a fixed value in the tensile or compression direction but the extent of corresponding stress hardening is different as shown in fig 8 generally the cyclic loading amplitude and history have a certain effect on stress hardening the degree of stress hardening under variable amplitude cyclic loading is higher than constant amplitude cyclic loading 4 there is no obvious stiffness degradation on the steel under different cyclic loading program 5 the hysteresis curve of each cyclic loading program like a shuttle is plump which represents the steel has a good energy dissipation capacity 6 the specimen is loaded symmetrically under cl va 2 but the hysteresis curve is asymmetric on the strain axis as shown in fig 9 the hysteretic behavior of steel is not only controlled by the isotropic hardening but also constrained by the kinematic hardening therefore the hysteresis curve of the steel shows non linear combined hardening characteristics obviously 3 2 2 hysteresis skeleton curves it is seen from fig 7 that the mechanical properties of steel under monotonic and cyclic loading are different in order to compare the difference more intuitively the maximum engineering stress and strain values of hysteretic curves are used to fit the hysteresis skeleton curves of different cyclic loading program with the ramberg osgood model the ramberg osgood formula is shown as follow 3 δ ε 2 δ ε e 2 δ ε p 2 δ σ 2 e δ σ 2 k 1 n where δε is the total strain amplitude δε e is the elastic strain amplitude δε p is the plastic strain amplitude δσ is the stabilized stress amplitude at half of number of cycles e is the young s module k is the cyclic strength coefficient and n is the cyclic strain hardening exponent the materials constant k and n can be obtained from a power law regression fit to stress amplitude versus plastic strain amplitude data the test hysteresis curves are fitted by the ramberg osgood model and the material parameters in eq 3 are derived and listed in table 6 in fig 10 it is easy to see that cyclic hardening will increase steel strength by 9 20 when the cyclic loading amplitudes are less than 3 as the cyclic loading amplitude increases the stabilized stress amplitude rises substantially to the values which are much higher than the ultimate engineering stress reached in monotonic loading tests 3 2 3 energy dissipation the energy dissipation coefficient is used to evaluate the energy dissipation capacity of steel wang et al 2014 nakashima 1995 the formula is shown as follow 4 e e s acg s ecg s δ aob s δ eof where s acg and s ecg are the area of the hysteresis curves in the upper and lower parts of the horizontal axis respectively s δaob和s δeof are the area of the triangle in the upper and lower parts of the horizontal axis respectively the area of each part is shown in fig 11 the greater the energy dissipation coefficient the more plump the hysteresis curve is and the stronger the energy dissipation capacity of steel is specimens are loaded symmetrically or in the tensile direction under cl ca 1 cl ca 2 cl ca 3 and cl ca 4 the average energy dissipation coefficients are 2 88 3 20 2 42 and 2 84 respectively hence the energy dissipation capacity of steel is gradually strengthened with the increase of cyclic loading amplitude the change process of energy dissipation coefficients under different cyclic loading program is shown in fig 12 the energy dissipation coefficient rise gradually and stabilize at about 3 1 when specimens are loaded under cl va 1 and cl va 3 meanwhile specimens are tested the initial loading amplitude are 0 0 75 and 3 5 respectively with the same cyclic loading amplitude and the loading increase amplitude under cl va 2 cl va 5 and cl va 6 but the change process of energy dissipation coefficient is different obviously in addition the energy dissipation coefficients of specimens loaded under cl va 2 and cl va 5 drop suddenly in varying degrees and reach stable finally the initial loading states of specimens tested under cl va 2 and cl va 5 are in the elastic stage yielding strain is 1 while cl va 6 is in the plastic stage therefore the energy dissipation capacity is related to the initial loading state the energy dissipation capacity with initial loading state in the elastic stage is better than in the plastic stage the maximum value of dissipation energy coefficient is e emax 4 0 the energy dissipation coefficient of the steel is between 3 0 and 3 4 when the cyclic loading amplitude is more than 4 which show that nv d36 steel has a good energy dissipation capacity generally in a certain cyclic loading range the larger the cyclic loading amplitude is the more fully the energy dissipation capacity of the steel is utilized 4 simulations 4 1 calibration of a cyclic material hardening model the hysteresis curves show characteristics of combined hardening obviously according to the test results therefore the combined hardening criterion of cyclic constitutive model can reflect the evolution of the yield surface of steel under cyclic loading more realistically the combined hardening parameters of steel are calibrated by chaboche cyclic constitutive model chaboche 1986 the yield surface is defined by eq 5 and the flow law of plastic strain is shown in the eq 6 the combined hardening criterion includes two parts isotropic hardening and kinematic hardening 5 f f σ α σ 0 0 where f is the yield function f 0 is defined as the yield surface σ is the stress tensor α is the back stress tensor f σ α is the equivalent mises stress or hill stress σ 0 is the size of yield surface 6 ε pl ε pl f σ where ε pl is the plastic flow rate tensor ε pl is the equivalent plastic strain rate the isotropic hardening component defines the change of the size of the yield surface σ 0 as a function of equivalent plastic strain ε pl and is given by 7 σ 0 σ 0 q 1 e b where σ 0 is the yield stress at zero equivalent plastic strain q is the maximum change in the size of the yield surface and b is the rate at which the size of the yield surface changes as plastic strain increases the size of the yield surface in the i th cycle σ i 0 can be obtained from 8 σ i σ i σ i 2 where σ i t is the maximum tensile stress and σ i c is the maximum compressive stress as shown in fig 13 the equivalent plastic strain ε i pl is define as 9 ε i 1 2 4 i 3 δ ε pl where δε pl is the plastic strain range and can be approximated as 10 δ ε pl δ ε 2 σ 1 e eq 7 can be calibrated through each data pair σ i 0 ε i pl including the value σ 0 at zero equivalent plastic strain the kinematic hardening component of the model defines the change of back stress α as is expressed in eq 11 11 α k c k i n k γ k 1 e γ k ε pl α k e γ k ε pl 12 α k 1 n α k where c kin k and γ k are constants that can be calibrated by test data from a stabilized hysteresis curve the ratio c kin γ k is the maximum change in back stress and γ k determines the rate at which the back stress varies as the plastic strain increases α k is kth back stress and α k 1 is kth back stress of the first data point k 1 2 3 4 n the multiple back stress superposition eq 12 is adopted for fitting the curve more accurately data pairs σ i ε i pl are shifted as follow 13 ε i ε i σ i e ε pl such that ε 1 pl 0 where ε pl 0is the value of plastic strain when the curve crosses the strain axis for each data pair σ i ε i pl values of α i are obtained as 14 α i σ i σ s where σ s is the average stress of the first and the last data points σ 1 and σ n respectively as shown in fig 13 eq 11 can be fitted to the pairs of data points α i ε i pl the correct fitting of eqs 7 and 11 is the key to obtaining accurate combined hardening parameters therefore the details of the fitting process require considered carefully eqs 7 and 11 are used for the fitting of isotropic hardening and kinematic hardening parameters respectively both fits can be classified into multi parameter nonlinear fittings which can generally be fitted by the least squares method the fitted data is derived from the stabilized loop of the hysteresis curve the 1 2 n p cycle or the outermost cycle in addition when fitting eq 11 the number of back stress determines the fitting accuracy of the hysteresis curve and the fitting with multiple back stresses the obtained fitting hysteresis curve is more consistent with the test hysteresis curve in order to obtain better fitting accuracy and appropriate calculation efficiency in the current paper k equals 4 in eq 12 4 2 the validation of hardening parameters by means of the above method the stabilized loops of the hysteresis curve are used and a series of control parameters of combined hardening are obtained due to the extreme cyclic loads such as earthquakes have a strong randomness and a variety of loading conditions may appear therefore the average values of the above calibration parameters are applied into the subsequent analysis the average values of the above calibration parameters are shown in table 7 then the parameters are inputted into the steel cyclic constitutive model of the finite element software abaqus 2007 for the simulation of hysteresis curves obtained from cyclic loading test in the hysteresis curve simulation process it should be noted that the monotonic behavior data input by the specimen model is taken from the true stress strain relationship of the steel and the output simulation curve is a reflection of the engineering stress strain relationship of the steel the simulation curves are shown in fig 14 4 3 error analysis in order to evaluate the simulations of hysteresis curves the relative error of peak stress and energy dissipation of hysteretic curve is analyzed the calculation method of relative error is as follows 15 δ x x x t 16 e r δ x x t where δx is the absolute error x and x t are the data obtained from tests and simulations e r is the relative error fig 15 is the peak stress of the hysteresis curve of the specimen under cl va 2 loading program the peak stress obtained by fem is greater than test but the difference between the two methods is small the rest cyclic loading program is also analyzed like cl va 2 loading program and the relative error of peak stress is shown in table 8 the relative error of peak stress in tensile direction is smaller than that of compression the average minimum error is less than 5 and the average maximum error is less than 10 which are all acceptable similarly the relative error analysis of the energy dissipation is also performed the hysteresis curves of the constant amplitude cyclic loading are almost coincident therefore the maximum error and the minimum error are consistent with the average error the specific relative error of each specimen is shown in table 9 the average of minimum and maximum error is all less than 5 therefore it can be proved that the parameters could simulate the peak stress and energy dissipation of hysteretic curve well above relative error analysis prove that the combined hardening parameters can simulate the hysteresis

provide an experimental basis for the calculation of jacket offshore platforms 2 under cyclic loading the strength of the steel nv d36 is strengthened but the strain is degraded the responses of steel under cyclic loading are quite different from that under monotonic loading due to the influence of cyclic hardening or softening and bauschinger effect the ramberg osgood model can be used to fit the

23087,jacket offshore platform serving in the marine environment is often subjected to severe dynamic loads such as winds waves currents and earthquakes the alternating stress state of jacket offshore platform will lead to the degradation of mechanical properties of the structural steel which results in the decline of the overall bearing capacity in this paper eighteen types of cyclic loading program designed according to the characteristics of the steel and extreme cyclic loads are presented for the first time the hysteresis behavior of structural steel nv d36 under various cyclic loading program is studied the changing process of energy dissipation capacity of the steel under different loading program is compared the hysteresis skeleton curve of steel under variable amplitude cyclic loading is fitted based on the basis of the classical ramberg osgood model the parameters of combined hardening of the steel based on chaboche constitutive model are calibrated the results of the cyclic loading are numerically simulated with the obtained hysteresis skeleton curves and parameters the combined hardening criterion can be used to analyze the responses of the steel under cyclic loading and the parameters can be applied to study the dynamic properties of the jacket offshore platform of structural steel nv d36 keywords marine structural steel cyclic loading program cyclic loading test hysteretic behavior chaboche constitutive model 1 introduction 1jacket offshore platforms are majorly located in a severe environment and usually subjected to crucial dynamic loads caused by winds waves and currents occasionally there are hurricanes earthquakes or other extreme cyclic loads wang et al 2006 extreme cyclic loads such as earthquakes can result in the positive and negative change alternately of structural internal forces under those extreme cyclic loads structural members particularly those acting as dissipative elements will experience small numbers of large plastic deformation cycles in a short time this process that lead to structural members damage or failure caused by small numbers of cyclic loading can be seen as low cycle fatigue kuroda 2002 nip et al 2010 once low cycle fatigue loads such as earthquakes and hurricanes occur jacket offshore platforms maybe destroyed seriously or even collapse health and safety executive hse 1999 in the last two decades earthquakes and hurricanes have caused serious damage to several jacket offshore platforms in service panthaki 1992 ajamy et al 2014 the study on fatigue of jacket offshore platform mainly concentrated on the high cycle fatigue life caused by waves currents and other common cyclic loads but rarely focused on the features of material or structure mechanical properties caused by hurricanes earthquakes and other extreme cyclic loads abs 2014 dnvgl rp c203 2016 besides steel engineering stress strain relation is commonly defined as bilinear or multi linear simplified models in the current engineering calculation kuroda 2002 xue 2008 nip et al 2010 however due to cyclic hardening or softening and bauschinger effect of steel those simplified models have a great difference from the real stress strain relation which are shown in fig 1 shi et al 2011 those simplified methods cannot provide a very accurate simulation on steel mechanical behavior under cyclic loading therefore it is significant to obtain engineering stress strain relation accurately under cyclic loading to evaluate the ultimate state of structure and safety of overall structure many scholars have put forward some simplified cyclic constitutive models such as bilinear model three linear model skeleton model and non linear model to simulate the material in structure under cyclic loading ramberg and osgood 1943 proposed a widely used three parameter model to describe the hysteresis skeleton curve of metal materials jhansale 1977 proposed an inelastic computation model of structural material under complex cyclic loading and described the hysteresis skeleton curve by piecewise polyline krawinkler et al 1983 1985 develop a mathematical model for uniaxial cyclic stress strain behavior of steel assuming the existence of stress bounds which is controlled by hardening softening and mean stress relaxation chaboche 1986 1991 proposed a cyclic constitutive model considering the characteristics of isotropic hardening and kinematic hardening to describe the hysteretic behavior based on elastic plasticity theory the initial yield condition and the flow law have been basically agreed based on the classical plastic theory of the unified system under the drucker 1951 postulate therefore the main difference among the above constitutive models is how to define the evolution law of the initial yield surface hardening criterion generally the hardening criterion can be divided into linear hardening criterion and nonlinear hardening criterion the form of linear hardening criterion is simple and easy to apply but its simulation of the real yield surface is poor the form of nonlinear hardening criterion is more complex but its simulation is closer to the evolution law of the real yield surface lee et al 2009 take the hardening criterion of the nonlinear cyclic constitutive model as an example myers 2009 as shown in fig 2 the hardening criterion can be equivalent to isotropic hardening criterion kinematic hardening criterion or combined hardening criterion the isotropic hardening criterion means that the initial yield surface expands along each stress direction uniformly under cyclic loading the kinematic hardening criterion is that the subsequent yield surface only move without shape change under cyclic loading the combined hardening criterion is the combination of isotropic hardening and kinematic hardening therefore it is crucial to obtain the reliable control parameters of hardening criterion for constructing the constitutive relation of steel under cyclic loading accurately because of the cyclic constitutive model is related to the material properties and processing technology of the steel the control parameters of hardening criterion of the specific steel are usually calibrated by the cyclic loading test generally the test types are divided into shaking table test pseudo dynamic test and pseudo static test low cycle cyclic loading test shaking table test and pseudo dynamic test are the closest to the real loading condition but its strict full size test conditions and high test costs result in such tests are difficult to implement however low cycle cyclic loading test can be easily conducted to obtain the strength stiffness and energy dissipation and other important information it becomes most economically effective method to acquire the hardening parameters and establish the cyclic constitutive relation robert 1996 some scholars have carried on low cycle cyclic loading test to various metal materials and obtained suitable cyclic constitutive relation dusicka et al 2007 nip 2010 shi et al 2011 shi et al 2012 the cyclic loading program of the above test is triangular waveforms but the loading amplitude loading history and the number of loading program are different the cyclic constitutive relation of material is not only dependent on the properties of the material but also the characteristics of cyclic loads therefore it is very important to determine the loading amplitude loading history and the number of loading program extreme cyclic loads such as earthquakes have strong randomness superstition hills 02 seismic spectrum was measured by el centro imp co cent in 1987 and the acceleration time history are shown in fig 3 yang et al 2017 part a is the typical stage of load amplitude increasing and the amplitude is symmetry part b is a reverse loading stage with large amplitude part c cyclic loading in the tensile direction is a one way loading stage the a b and c section is only part of the extreme cyclic loads therefore a rich and accurate cyclic loading program should be designed to reflect the characteristics of the material itself and the seismic loads in the current paper various types of cyclic loading program are designed according to the characteristics of the steel and extreme cyclic loads then we choose the high performance marine structural steel hpms nv d36 to carry out the experimental study under different cyclic loading program for analyzing the monotonic behavior hysteretic behavior and energy dissipation capacity of the steel further ramberg osgood 1943 model is used to fit the hysteresis skeleton curves and chaboche 1986 model is applied to calibrate the combined hardening parameters after the calibration finite element software abaqus is used to simulate and verify the test hysteresis curves the experimental basis is provided for the response analysis of hpms nv d36 steel in the overall jacket offshore platform 2 material and testing arrangements 2 1 material and specimen the material in this study is hpms nv d36 steel which is certificated by det norske veritas classification society dnv the steel chemical composition is summarized in table 1 obtained from the mill certificate the carbon content of the steel is about 0 11 therefore the steel is classified as mild steel the percent of c element is less than 0 25 yield strength and ultimate strength of the steel are 430 mpa and 553 mpa respectively ultimate elongation is 26 due to the different test conditions between steel mill and laboratory the steel monotonic mechanical properties data provided by the mill certificate are for reference only since plate and pipe are widely used in jacket offshore platforms the sheet specimens are adopted in the test instead of specimens with round cross section according to the test standard developed by american society for testing and materials astm 1998 the specimen includes test zone transition zone and clamping position the shape and sizes of specimen are shown in fig 4 in order to avoid buckling while the compressive force is anticipated in the loading program the length of the test zone is slightly smaller than those in the test standard 2 2 test setup instron 8801 hydraulic fatigue testing machine is used for monotonic loading test and cyclic loading test the dynamic load capacity range of the testing machine is 100 kn the strain of specimens in the test is measured using an extensometer with gauge length of 12 5 mm and measuring range of 35 the strain data is obtained from the conversion of displacement results recorded by testing machine when measured strain is more than 35 the data of load displacement and strain in out in the test are recorded by static strain testing machine in real time and the data acquisition frequency is 50 hz the layout of the test setup with extensometer is shown in fig 5 2 3 monotonic loading program three specimens named ml 1 ml 2 and ml 3 respectively are tested under monotonic loading according to the standard gb t 228 1 2010 to obtain the basic mechanical properties of the steel 2 4 cyclic loading program based on the steel mechanical properties and the characteristics of cyclic loads such as earthquakes that jacket offshore platforms may suffer eighteen types of cyclic loading program are designed the cyclic loading program applied to specimens are separated into two types constant amplitude cyclic loading program and variable amplitude cyclic loading program which are named cl ca x and cl va x respectively 2 4 1 constant amplitude cyclic loading program various constant amplitude cyclic loading program is adopted into specimens to investigate the features of hysteresis curves cyclic hardening and energy dissipation capacity of the steel specimens are tested under cl ca 1 4 to analyze the effects of different cyclic loading amplitudes for cyclic hardening and energy dissipation capacity of the steel cl ca 5 cl ca 6 and cl ca 7 are designed to study the steel hysteretic behavior after suffered from extreme cyclic loads suddenly in order to compare and analyze the steel hysteretic behavior caused by initial loading direction before it suffered from extreme cyclic loads such as earthquake the specimens are tested under cl ca 8 and cl ca 9 the details of cl ca x are as follows see table 2 2 4 2 variable amplitude cyclic loading program different variable amplitude cyclic loading program is applied to specimens to find the characteristics of hysteresis curves hysteresis skeleton curves cyclic hardening and energy dissipation capacity of the steel cl va 1 and cl va 2 are set out to obtain the features of hysteresis skeleton curves and energy dissipation capacity of the steel when it is loaded in the tensile direction and symmetrically cl va 3 and cl va 4 are applied to specimens for acquiring the characteristics of hysteresis skeleton curves cyclic hardening and energy dissipation capacity of the steel caused by the direction of cyclic loading specimens are tested under cl va 5 and cl va 6 to analyze the characteristics of energy dissipation capacity of the steel caused by varying in initial plastic stage of the steel cl va 7 is set out to obtain the features of hysteretic behavior of the steel when it is loaded with constant amplitude but yield surface keeps moving specimens are loaded under cl va 8 and cl va 9 to study the features of hysteretic behavior of the steel caused by random cyclic loads the details of cl va x are shown in table 3 all cyclic loading tests are tested at room temperature the cyclic loading program is designed as triangular wave program the strain rate is approximately 0 05 hz gb t 26077 2010 so that the influence of temperature by reason of specimen friction can be neglected once distinctive cracks or buckling appear on specimen the cyclic loading would be ceased immediately after the cyclic loading test the specimens are loaded until failure 3 test results 3 1 monotonic behavior the mechanical properties parameters of steel obtained from the monotonic loading test are the basis of the subsequent test and analysis the monotonic loading mechanical properties parameters data obtained from steel mill and laboratory maybe different hence specimens ml 1 ml 2 and ml 3 are conducted on monotonic loading test respectively since the constraint of measuring range of extensometer the measured strain exceeds 35 cannot be collected by the extensometer accurately we can obtain the engineering strain from the conversion of displacement results recorded by testing machine the strain in the test is directly measured by a tensile and compression extensometer it is known from the working principle of the extensometer that the measured strain is the engineering strain the stress in the test is the ratio of the tensile or compress force measured by the testing machine to the initial cross sectional area of the test zone of specimen which is the engineering stress therefore the engineering stress strain curves of monotonic loading of the steel are obtained and shown in fig 6 and engineering stress and engineering strain can be calculated from eqs 1 and 2 1 ε δ l l 0 2 σ p a 0 where σ and ε represent the engineering stress and engineering strain of the steel respectively δl represents the displacement of test zone l 0 represents the initial length of test zone p represents the tensile or compressive load a 0 represents the initial cross sectional area of test zone theoretically the specimen deformation in the test is large which belongs to the category of big deformation because of the limitation of test method this deformation is still treated as small deformation the strain used in this paper is the engineering strain measured by the extensometer table 4 provides details of the monotonic loading test results the yield strength and ultimate strength are 414 mpa and 550 mpa respectively which are slightly different from the data steel mills provided the engineering strain at fracture strength is about 60 4 which shows the steel has a good ductility the comparison of engineering stress strain curves between monotonic loading and cyclic loading is shown in fig 7 there is great diﬀerence between the monotonic and cyclic loading curve due to the cyclic hardening or softening and bauschinger eﬀect particularly cyclic loading leading to the deterioration of the fracture strain that makes the ductility of the steel become worse but the strength in strain hardening ranges of cyclic loading curve is higher than that of monotonic loading curve 3 2 hysteretic behavior 3 2 1 hysteresis curves the stress and strain in the analysis of hysteretic behavior like the monotonic behavior represent the engineering stress and engineering strain respectively the hysteresis curves and the specific mechanical properties parameters of the specimen under different cyclic loading program is shown in fig 9 and table 5 respectively the mechanical properties of the steel obtained from the hysteresis curves and mechanical properties parameters are shown as 1 the hysteresis curves of steel under different cyclic loading program have no obvious yield plateau 2 after the cyclic loading the ultimate strength of steel has been strengthened and the elongation of the steel has been degraded the degree of change is related to the cyclic loading program 3 the stress hardening phenomenon appeared on the first cycle and strengthened at subsequent cycles gradually when specimens are loaded under cl ca 1 and cl ca 2 under variable amplitude cyclic loading program the specimens are loaded to a fixed value in the tensile or compression direction but the extent of corresponding stress hardening is different as shown in fig 8 generally the cyclic loading amplitude and history have a certain effect on stress hardening the degree of stress hardening under variable amplitude cyclic loading is higher than constant amplitude cyclic loading 4 there is no obvious stiffness degradation on the steel under different cyclic loading program 5 the hysteresis curve of each cyclic loading program like a shuttle is plump which represents the steel has a good energy dissipation capacity 6 the specimen is loaded symmetrically under cl va 2 but the hysteresis curve is asymmetric on the strain axis as shown in fig 9 the hysteretic behavior of steel is not only controlled by the isotropic hardening but also constrained by the kinematic hardening therefore the hysteresis curve of the steel shows non linear combined hardening characteristics obviously 3 2 2 hysteresis skeleton curves it is seen from fig 7 that the mechanical properties of steel under monotonic and cyclic loading are different in order to compare the difference more intuitively the maximum engineering stress and strain values of hysteretic curves are used to fit the hysteresis skeleton curves of different cyclic loading program with the ramberg osgood model the ramberg osgood formula is shown as follow 3 δ ε 2 δ ε e 2 δ ε p 2 δ σ 2 e δ σ 2 k 1 n where δε is the total strain amplitude δε e is the elastic strain amplitude δε p is the plastic strain amplitude δσ is the stabilized stress amplitude at half of number of cycles e is the young s module k is the cyclic strength coefficient and n is the cyclic strain hardening exponent the materials constant k and n can be obtained from a power law regression fit to stress amplitude versus plastic strain amplitude data the test hysteresis curves are fitted by the ramberg osgood model and the material parameters in eq 3 are derived and listed in table 6 in fig 10 it is easy to see that cyclic hardening will increase steel strength by 9 20 when the cyclic loading amplitudes are less than 3 as the cyclic loading amplitude increases the stabilized stress amplitude rises substantially to the values which are much higher than the ultimate engineering stress reached in monotonic loading tests 3 2 3 energy dissipation the energy dissipation coefficient is used to evaluate the energy dissipation capacity of steel wang et al 2014 nakashima 1995 the formula is shown as follow 4 e e s acg s ecg s δ aob s δ eof where s acg and s ecg are the area of the hysteresis curves in the upper and lower parts of the horizontal axis respectively s δaob和s δeof are the area of the triangle in the upper and lower parts of the horizontal axis respectively the area of each part is shown in fig 11 the greater the energy dissipation coefficient the more plump the hysteresis curve is and the stronger the energy dissipation capacity of steel is specimens are loaded symmetrically or in the tensile direction under cl ca 1 cl ca 2 cl ca 3 and cl ca 4 the average energy dissipation coefficients are 2 88 3 20 2 42 and 2 84 respectively hence the energy dissipation capacity of steel is gradually strengthened with the increase of cyclic loading amplitude the change process of energy dissipation coefficients under different cyclic loading program is shown in fig 12 the energy dissipation coefficient rise gradually and stabilize at about 3 1 when specimens are loaded under cl va 1 and cl va 3 meanwhile specimens are tested the initial loading amplitude are 0 0 75 and 3 5 respectively with the same cyclic loading amplitude and the loading increase amplitude under cl va 2 cl va 5 and cl va 6 but the change process of energy dissipation coefficient is different obviously in addition the energy dissipation coefficients of specimens loaded under cl va 2 and cl va 5 drop suddenly in varying degrees and reach stable finally the initial loading states of specimens tested under cl va 2 and cl va 5 are in the elastic stage yielding strain is 1 while cl va 6 is in the plastic stage therefore the energy dissipation capacity is related to the initial loading state the energy dissipation capacity with initial loading state in the elastic stage is better than in the plastic stage the maximum value of dissipation energy coefficient is e emax 4 0 the energy dissipation coefficient of the steel is between 3 0 and 3 4 when the cyclic loading amplitude is more than 4 which show that nv d36 steel has a good energy dissipation capacity generally in a certain cyclic loading range the larger the cyclic loading amplitude is the more fully the energy dissipation capacity of the steel is utilized 4 simulations 4 1 calibration of a cyclic material hardening model the hysteresis curves show characteristics of combined hardening obviously according to the test results therefore the combined hardening criterion of cyclic constitutive model can reflect the evolution of the yield surface of steel under cyclic loading more realistically the combined hardening parameters of steel are calibrated by chaboche cyclic constitutive model chaboche 1986 the yield surface is defined by eq 5 and the flow law of plastic strain is shown in the eq 6 the combined hardening criterion includes two parts isotropic hardening and kinematic hardening 5 f f σ α σ 0 0 where f is the yield function f 0 is defined as the yield surface σ is the stress tensor α is the back stress tensor f σ α is the equivalent mises stress or hill stress σ 0 is the size of yield surface 6 ε pl ε pl f σ where ε pl is the plastic flow rate tensor ε pl is the equivalent plastic strain rate the isotropic hardening component defines the change of the size of the yield surface σ 0 as a function of equivalent plastic strain ε pl and is given by 7 σ 0 σ 0 q 1 e b where σ 0 is the yield stress at zero equivalent plastic strain q is the maximum change in the size of the yield surface and b is the rate at which the size of the yield surface changes as plastic strain increases the size of the yield surface in the i th cycle σ i 0 can be obtained from 8 σ i σ i σ i 2 where σ i t is the maximum tensile stress and σ i c is the maximum compressive stress as shown in fig 13 the equivalent plastic strain ε i pl is define as 9 ε i 1 2 4 i 3 δ ε pl where δε pl is the plastic strain range and can be approximated as 10 δ ε pl δ ε 2 σ 1 e eq 7 can be calibrated through each data pair σ i 0 ε i pl including the value σ 0 at zero equivalent plastic strain the kinematic hardening component of the model defines the change of back stress α as is expressed in eq 11 11 α k c k i n k γ k 1 e γ k ε pl α k e γ k ε pl 12 α k 1 n α k where c kin k and γ k are constants that can be calibrated by test data from a stabilized hysteresis curve the ratio c kin γ k is the maximum change in back stress and γ k determines the rate at which the back stress varies as the plastic strain increases α k is kth back stress and α k 1 is kth back stress of the first data point k 1 2 3 4 n the multiple back stress superposition eq 12 is adopted for fitting the curve more accurately data pairs σ i ε i pl are shifted as follow 13 ε i ε i σ i e ε pl such that ε 1 pl 0 where ε pl 0is the value of plastic strain when the curve crosses the strain axis for each data pair σ i ε i pl values of α i are obtained as 14 α i σ i σ s where σ s is the average stress of the first and the last data points σ 1 and σ n respectively as shown in fig 13 eq 11 can be fitted to the pairs of data points α i ε i pl the correct fitting of eqs 7 and 11 is the key to obtaining accurate combined hardening parameters therefore the details of the fitting process require considered carefully eqs 7 and 11 are used for the fitting of isotropic hardening and kinematic hardening parameters respectively both fits can be classified into multi parameter nonlinear fittings which can generally be fitted by the least squares method the fitted data is derived from the stabilized loop of the hysteresis curve the 1 2 n p cycle or the outermost cycle in addition when fitting eq 11 the number of back stress determines the fitting accuracy of the hysteresis curve and the fitting with multiple back stresses the obtained fitting hysteresis curve is more consistent with the test hysteresis curve in order to obtain better fitting accuracy and appropriate calculation efficiency in the current paper k equals 4 in eq 12 4 2 the validation of hardening parameters by means of the above method the stabilized loops of the hysteresis curve are used and a series of control parameters of combined hardening are obtained due to the extreme cyclic loads such as earthquakes have a strong randomness and a variety of loading conditions may appear therefore the average values of the above calibration parameters are applied into the subsequent analysis the average values of the above calibration parameters are shown in table 7 then the parameters are inputted into the steel cyclic constitutive model of the finite element software abaqus 2007 for the simulation of hysteresis curves obtained from cyclic loading test in the hysteresis curve simulation process it should be noted that the monotonic behavior data input by the specimen model is taken from the true stress strain relationship of the steel and the output simulation curve is a reflection of the engineering stress strain relationship of the steel the simulation curves are shown in fig 14 4 3 error analysis in order to evaluate the simulations of hysteresis curves the relative error of peak stress and energy dissipation of hysteretic curve is analyzed the calculation method of relative error is as follows 15 δ x x x t 16 e r δ x x t where δx is the absolute error x and x t are the data obtained from tests and simulations e r is the relative error fig 15 is the peak stress of the hysteresis curve of the specimen under cl va 2 loading program the peak stress obtained by fem is greater than test but the difference between the two methods is small the rest cyclic loading program is also analyzed like cl va 2 loading program and the relative error of peak stress is shown in table 8 the relative error of peak stress in tensile direction is smaller than that of compression the average minimum error is less than 5 and the average maximum error is less than 10 which are all acceptable similarly the relative error analysis of the energy dissipation is also performed the hysteresis curves of the constant amplitude cyclic loading are almost coincident therefore the maximum error and the minimum error are consistent with the average error the specific relative error of each specimen is shown in table 9 the average of minimum and maximum error is all less than 5 therefore it can be proved that the parameters could simulate the peak stress and energy dissipation of hysteretic curve well above relative error analysis prove that the combined hardening parameters can simulate the hysteresis curves very well therefore the calibration method and parameters provide a reference for describing the hysteretic properties of nv d36 steel members or structures accurately 5 conclusions monotonic and cyclic loading test of high performance marine structure steel nv d36 are carried out the monotonic properties energy dissipation capacity and hysteresis curves of the steel are analyzed the hysteresis skeleton curves of the steel are fitted and the combine hardening parameters of steel are calibrated based on chaboche cyclic constitutive model the conclusions of the study are as follows 1 hysteretic properties test with different types of cyclic loading program was carry out for the high performance marine structure steel nv d36 the parameters of combined hardening in chaboche cyclic constitutive model are calibrated and the cyclic constitutive model used in the dynamic response analysis of the steel under the condition of various cyclic loads is verified the parameters can provide an experimental basis for the calculation of jacket offshore platforms 2 under cyclic loading the strength of the steel nv d36 is strengthened but the strain is degraded the responses of steel under cyclic loading are quite different from that under monotonic loading due to the influence of cyclic hardening or softening and bauschinger effect the ramberg osgood model can be used to fit the hysteresis skeleton curve it is not accurate to calculate the dynamic responses of steel under cyclic loading by using the constitutive relation under monotonic loading 3 under different cyclic

23088,a review of the multibody dynamics in the applications of ships and offshore structures is presented in this study as the processes for the design and production of ships and offshore structures become various and complicated some physics based simulations that are based on multibody dynamics have been performed in the ship and offshore industries due to the characteristics of the processes some physical components such as connections and collisions should be taken into account to reflect real situations in this paper the physical components for multibody dynamics that should be considered for the design and production of ships and offshore structures are presented then the studies on the physics based simulations for the design production and installation processes and the decommissioning procedure are reviewed lastly several research directions are discussed in the conclusion graphical abstract image 1 keywords multibody dynamics physics based simulation ship and offshore structures 1 introduction the demand regarding the physics based simulations for the design and production of ships and offshore structures is consistently increasing so that the potential risks can be checked in advance for example as the process for the production of such structures in the shipyard becomes more diverse and complicated the performance of simulations that have not been tried previously are required furthermore to improve the safety and efficiency of the process a detailed modeling for the simulation is necessary to reflect real situations accurately which is impossible with conventional modeling methods the general processes for ships and offshore structures can be classified into the following three procedures according to the purpose of the simulation design production and installation or decommissioning figs 1 3 show examples of each procedure for which simulations are required as is presented the processes for ships and offshore structures can be represented as a multibody system which consists of several bodies that are connected by joints or wire ropes therefore a physics based simulation that is based on multibody dynamics should be performed in the ship and offshore industries a simplified model is mostly used to analyze the dynamic response of a given system for example fig 4 shows simplified and realistic models of a floating crane that lifts a block the simplified model that is shown in fig 4 a includes only the crane barge and the block that are connected by one wire rope which has the equivalent stiffness to a group of wire ropes in b the realistic multibody model of fig 4 b contains hooks and block loaders with additional multiple wire ropes for the same condition the weight and the inertia of the floating barge in the simplified model are same as those of the floating crane including jibs in the realistic model in the simplified model the wire rope is connected to the barge to the point that is fixed to the local coordinate of the barge the block weight is 5000 t and the wave condition is set at a wave height of 1 0 m a wave period of 10 s and a heading angle of 90 table 1 shows a comparison of the results according to two models the error percentage was calculated based on the realistic model method the sway roll and yaw motions of the floating crane are major differences due to the heading angle of the wave as is presented the result shows major differences due to the modeling effect although the mass and the inertia of the block are the same all of the block motions except for the heave show major differences this result implies that it is necessary to perform the motion analysis based on a multibody system realistic model multibody dynamics is a broad field of study under active research in the ship and offshore industries due to the characteristics of the complicated processes and the environmental conditions several physical components should be considered as shown in figs 1 3 firstly due to the oceanic environment external forces such as waves currents and winds should be considered when a body such as a block a structure and the other equipment of ships and offshore structures is lifted by a crane the wind force is also taken into consideration since its size may be immense besides the connections between it and the crane such as the wire ropes mooring lines and equalizers or block loaders should be considered here an equalizer is used to equally distribute the tensions acting on each wire rope of the crane as the crane lifting body may be heavy an accurate analysis of the connection between the body and the crane is required to prevent an accident lastly the collision between the body and the crane should be analyzed in the production and installation procedures a collision between the body and the crane or between the body and the wire rope often occurs therefore the collisional potential needs to be checked for and if it exists it needs to be determined whether the collisional force exceeds the allowable value or not so far various studies on physics based simulations in the ship and offshore industries have been conducted in this study the basic concept of the multibody system is introduced in consideration of several components due to the characteristics of the processes for the design and production of ships and offshore structures then the related studies on the physics based simulations that are based on multibody dynamics are reviewed 2 multibody system in this section the basic concept and the theoretical background of the multibody system are briefly introduced the multibody system is a system that consists of joint connected multiple bodies to analyze the dynamic behavior of the multibody system the equations of the motion containing the multiple bodies and the joints should be constructed and solved with external forces 2 1 modeling 2 1 1 body a body that makes up a multibody system can be divided into either a rigid or a flexible body depending on whether it is deformable or not the rigid body motions do not generate strains whereas the elastic motions generate strain fields the area of multibody dynamics was originally developed as a tool for the modeling of rigid multibody systems but it has considerably evolved so that it can now handle linearly and nonlinearly flexible multibody systems that comprise both rigid and flexible bodies bauchau 2011 2 1 2 joints in this study a joint is defined as a kinematic constraint between two bodies featherstone 2008 therefore the joints that connect two bodies impose restrictions on the relative motion of each of the bodies the joint can be categorized according to the motion that is allowed by the joint in three dimensional 3d space an unconstrained rigid body has six degrees of freedom dofs as follows translational and rotational motions that are about the three independent axes x y and z several common types of joints are shown in table 2 a detailed explanation and the mathematical description of each joint are presented in ham et al 2015 2 1 3 forces the motion of a body can be obtained by solving the newton euler equation using the given external forces also if two bodies are connected by a joint constraint forces are exerted onto both bodies to restrict the relative motion between them therefore for the motion analysis of a multibody system both the external and constraint forces should be taken into account however it is very complicated to calculate the constraint forces and it is difficult to apply the newton euler equation directly for those reasons a specific formulation of the motion equations is required for a multibody system 2 2 formulation to describe the motion of the multibody system various formulations have previously been suggested since the step of the finding of the constraint forces regarding multibody dynamics is very complicated shabana 1994 divided the formulations into two according to the constraint force consideration method as follows embedding technique and augmented formulation in addition lacoursière 2007 formulated the discrete euler lagrange del equation that is derived from the discretization of the euler lagrange equation other alternative approaches for the formulation of the motion equations of the multibody system are recursive methods shabana 1994 in this section each multibody system formulation is explained and the final form of the motion equations is described 2 2 1 embedding technique the formulations for the multibody system can be divided according to the constraint force consideration method the embedding technique that eliminates the constraint forces and is expressed regarding the independent coordinates is expressed as follows amirouche 1992 shabana 1994 1998 1 m q k q q f e m j t m j k j t m j q f e j t f e where m is the mass matrix q is the generalized coordinates f e is the external forces and j is the velocity transformation matrix between the absolute and generalized coordinates generally the embedding technique requires a minor computational cost because it allows the elimination of the dependent coordinates however an autonomic formulation of the motion equations is complicated and the constraint forces cannot be calculated zhao et al 2018 and cha et al 2010b applied embedding techniques to analyze the motion of ships and offshore structures 2 2 2 augmented formulation different from the embedding technique the augmented formulation adopts lagrange multipliers to calculate the constraint forces and the body coordinates are maintained in the augmented formulation the kinematic constraint equations are adjoined to the system dynamic differential equations using the technique of the lagrange multipliers wehage 1980 the augmented formulation is described as follows amirouche 1992 shabana 1994 1997 1998 2 m c r t c r 0 r λ f e c r r where r is the absolute coordinate c r is the constraint jacobian and λ is the lagrange multiplier the augmented formulation can be automatically generated with respect to the constraints and the external forces also the constraint forces can be calculated using the lagrange multipliers however it requires a high computational cost as the body number increases because all of the body coordinates are maintained 2 2 3 discrete euler lagrange equation lacoursière 2007 formulated the del equation by using regularized stabilized and variational methods for the multibody system the del equation is derived from the discretization step of the euler lagrange equation together with the application of the finite differential method that was studied by wendlandt and marsden 1997 marsden and west 2001 and lew 2003 equation 3 shows the final form of the del equation as follows 3 m c r t c r γ 4 ε h 2 v λ m v h f e 4 γ h c γ c r v where c is the constraints h is the step size γ is the stabilization constant and ε is the regularization constant the del equation can be automatically formulated and the constraint force calculation is similar to the augmented formulation but it contains the velocity rather than the acceleration ham et al 2015 applied the del equation to a number of examples in the ship and offshore industries 2 2 4 recursive newton euler formulation in the recursive newton euler formulation book 1984 changizi and shabana 1988 pereira and proenca 1991 the equations of motion are formulated regarding the joint dofs which lead to an automatic elimination of the workless constraint forces therefore the numerical procedure for the solving of these equations is much simpler than that of the other formulations the recursive newton euler formulation is expressed as follows featherstone 2008 shabana 1997 4 m i s i q i s i f i e f i c v i v i 1 s i q i a i a i 1 s i q i s i q i f i b i i a i v i i i v i f i f i b f i e f i 1 where s is the modified generalized coordinate s is the velocity transformation matrix i is the mass and the mass moment of inertia f b is the resultant force f e is the external force f is the force that is exerted on the joint and i indicates the ith body the transfer matrix method of the multibody system mstmm was developed by rui et al 2016 in the same way the recursive methods and the mstmm can be applied to the multibody system with a large number of bodies as they require only a minor computational cost however they cannot be applied directly to the closed loop systems which has a circuit of bodies such that the closed circuit can be traced through the system from one body to another and returns to the original body without traversing any body more than once roberson and schwertassek 1988 2 3 simulation in this section the physics based simulation of the multibody system is explained the overall procedure for the performance of the physics based simulation of the multibody system is presented in fig 5 as the multibody system is modeled the mathematical model can be constructed with the initial modeling information of the bodies joints and forces the equations of motion that are based on the newton euler equation form a basic theoretical background for the physics based simulation then the various formulations for multibody dynamics such as the augmented formulation embedding technique recursive newton euler formulation and del equation can be adopted as a result of the motion equation the acceleration x is obtained then the acceleration is numerically integrated to find the velocity x and the position x a variety of integration methods such as the adams bashforth method runge kutta method and stomer verlet method exist the external forces are then calculated using the calculated velocity and position of each body the total sum of the external forces will be the input of the motion equation in the next time step 3 multibody system in ships and offshore structures in the ship and offshore industries a number of essential components should be considered for the modeling and simulation of the corresponding processes in this section a modeling problem of the multibody system for ships and offshore structures is defined and a review of some of the related studies is performed 3 1 connection in the production and installation of ships and offshore structures the bodies are connected to each other with various equipment items not only the kinematic joints as explained in section 2 for an example of the floating crane block lifting operation a block is connected to the boom of a crane with several wire ropes and equalizers and the crane is moored to the quay and the seabed with several mooring lines also fenders are located between the crane and the quay to prevent a collision between them thus various connection types are present between the bodies and the modeling should be accurate according to the purpose of the simulation 3 1 1 wire rope the wire rope is one of the most common connection types between bodies in the ship and offshore industries a set of wire ropes is used to lift heavy objects such as a block or a structure the simplest way to represent the wire rope in a physics based simulation is to model it as an incompressible spring in this case the wire rope exerts forces onto both of the connected bodies when it is stretched and this is included as an external force of the multibody system however the modeling of the wire rope as an external force is not suitable for the representation of the various characteristics of the wire rope in some cases the three properties of real wire ropes are stretching bending and twisting while the incompressible spring can only represent stretching servin and lacoursiere 2007 2008 introduced a constraint based wire rope to model a more realistic wire rope here the wire rope is expressed as a kinematic constraint connecting two bodies then the constraint forces play the roles of stretching bending and twisting forces also the constraint based wire rope can represent the interbody contacts therefore some sophisticated equipment for which fixed and moving pulleys are utilized can be modeled with the constraint based wire rope pai 2002 modeled the wire rope with thin solids based on the cosserat theory lugris et al 2010 used the absolute nodal coordinate formulation ancf of shabana 1998 to model the wire rope and compared the result with that of the analytical method the continuum model of the wire rope is suitable for a representation of the various characteristics of a real wire rope however it increases the complexity of the system and requires a high computational cost 3 1 2 equalizer in the shipyard cranes such as the floating crane and the gantry crane are equipped with several hooks to lift heavy blocks or any other structures the numerous lifting points of the block disperse the weight while there is a limited number of hooks thus an equalizer or a block loader is connected to the hook of the crane to connect several wire ropes to one hook the equalizer is composed of several fixed and moving pulleys that are connected with one wire rope as each moving pulley moves up and down the tension of each wire rope is distributed equally cha et al 2010a used an approximated mechanism to represent the equalizer here as the wire ropes are modeled with incompressible springs the fixed and moving pulleys could not be modeled and the wire ropes are directly connected to the body of the equalizer then the length of each wire rope was stretched or shortened to distribute the tension equally the application of this mechanism is quite simple but a number of disadvantages are influential firstly it may cause numerically unstable problems due to the sudden change of the lengths of the wire ropes also this mechanism requires an artificial factor to control the change rate of the wire rope which can affect the systemic motion lastly the total length that can be extended or shortened is not controllable while it is limited in the real world ham et al 2016 introduced a more realistic equalizer model using the constraint based wire rope in their study the equalizer is modeled based on a real mechanism and the constant length constraint was used to model the wire rope that connects the fixed and moving pulleys then the model was applied to the typical lifting cases in the shipyard production process 3 1 3 mooring line most of the floating unit processes such as floating cranes and floating barges consist of a mooring system to maintain the unit positions the modeling of the mooring system plays an important role in the prediction of the unit responses and the loads on the mooring lines the following two types of the mooring system exist depending on the environmental condition and the purpose of the units taut mooring and catenary mooring taut mooring can be modeled as a massless wire rope as it uses the tension of the line rather than its weight while catenary mooring exerts forces based on its weight the three primary model types for the mooring analysis are as follows catenary model lumped mass model and finite element model tang et al 2009 the analytic approach for the calculation of the mooring force that is based on the self weight of a mooring line was introduced by faltinsen 1990 the catenary model is a quasistatic model that calculates the profile and the tension of the mooring line using analytical equations that are based on the assumption of the static equilibrium state this is a popular simple approach for the modeling of the mooring system but it is hampered by some usage restrictions the main disadvantage is that the hydrodynamic and inertial forces on the mooring line cannot be considered another approach for mooring line modeling is the lumped mass approach the lumped mass approach concentrates the mass and hydrodynamic forces at the nodes that are located at the end of each mooring line segment then the nodes are connected by massless springs that can simulate the stretching of the mooring line this approach was first suggested by walton and polachek 1959 and was later developed by khan and ansari 1986 in three dimensions recently hall and goupee 2015 introduced the extended lumped mass mooring model and validated it against semisubmersible model test data however for a system with multiple mooring lines the lumped mass approach appears as an inopportune approach for programming ma et al 2015 with these disadvantages of the catenary model and the lumped mass model the finite element method fem has become more popular an fem for the mooring system that considers the elastic deformation was presented by bathe 2014 garret 1982 advanced the elastic rod finite element model with a linear elasticity and the elastic rod method has been widely used in the analysis of slender components such as the mooring line riser and pipeline hong and hong 1997 and garrett 2005 developed numerical schemes for the mooring analysis and applied them in the field of ocean engineering more recently kim et al 2010 2013 analyzed the behavior of the elastic catenary system using a nonlinear fem and extended the research to the multibody system 3 1 4 fender in the shipyard when a vessel is moored to the quay or berthed next to another vessel the fender is used to prevent collisional damage the fender system absorbs the collisional energy during a collision with a vessel resulting in nonlinear behavior in the physics based simulation the fender can be simply represented as an external force using a nonlinear spring the maximum reaction force of the fender is determined by various factors such as the collisional angle velocity and temperature then the ratio of the reaction force can be obtained by an experiment that is based on the deflection length accordingly the fender can be represented as a nonlinear spring whose stiffness changes according to the deflection length and it exerts forces when it is compressed 3 2 collision in the production and installation processes the collisions between bodies or between a body and wire ropes frequently occur in some cases the outfitting of the block can be damaged due to collisions with wire ropes or other structures and if the contact force of the structure exceeds the allowable value an accident can be caused the collisional analysis should be done before the execution of the processes to prevent such risks 3 2 1 interbody collisions the need for the collisional analysis that has not been tried previously is increasing for example in the block erection or lifting off operations the block or structures are laid down onto the existing hull structures or the floating barge as shown in fig 6 in these processes collision is a major consideration the collisional processing including the collisional detection and the rigid body response are two of the most difficult areas in the simulation of the multibody system in this section the most popular collision processing techniques are presented and the applications in the ship and offshore industries are introduced the collisional processing can be divided into the following two procedures collisional detection and collisional response the collisional detection is a geometric problem of colliding objects the collisional detection between bodies and the contact computation have been presented by teschner et al 2005 extended works on the discrete and continuous methods for the checking of the collisional potential or penetration were introduced by erleben 2004 at a broad level the following two methods are commonly used in the collisional response schmucker et al 2007 impulse based method mirtich 1996 and force based method baraff 1992 moore and wilhelms 1988 the impulse based method uses the collisional impulses between the bodies and changes the velocity of the bodies during the contact in consideration of the impulse conservation law the main advantages of this method are the need for only a few constants for the description of the impulse conservation law and the absence of a response calculation influence on the integrator step size because it is performed during an infinitely small time instant schmucker et al 2007 also this method is computationally efficient for systems that contain many bodies however as it changes the velocity directly the traditional ordinary differential equation ode solver cannot be used therefore for the multibody system that consists of bodies that are connected by joints the impulse based method is not applicable jeong et al 2016 applied this method for a collisional analysis of the lift off simulation but only a single body was considered as the colliding body the force based method or the penalty based method is based on the separation forces that are caused by the penetration of colliding bodies the calculation of the collisional force is a difficult problem and a number of existing methods can be applied one method is the force based method with a penalty formulation for which a nonlinear spring and a damper are used the virtual spring and the damper system are modeled between the bodies when they collide and the spring forces act as collisional forces this method is simple it is applicable to the multibody system and it can be easily extended to the handling of soft bodies however the main disadvantages are the existence of various collisional parameters for the modeling of the spring damper system and the absence of general approaches for the selection of the parameters that match the physical laws besides the collisional detection is a major problem because the penetration depth and point should be computed lee et al 2016a used this method for the collisional analysis of a block erection operation the other approach to calculate the collisional force is the force based method for which a constraint using lagrange multiplier formulation is used the collision between bodies is modeled in terms of mechanical constraints and the reaction forces act as collisional forces ham et al 2017a analyzed the collision of the subsea equipment on an offshore supply vessel osv using noninterpenetration constraints the bodies were represented by continuously differentiable functions and the equations of motion were reformulated using noninterpenetration constraints 3 2 2 collision between a body and a wire rope as shown in fig 7 the block turnover operation by cranes often causes an interference between the block and the wire ropes if the contact forces that are exerted on the block and the wire ropes exceed the allowable value the block and the wire ropes can be damaged therefore before the actual execution the block lug points should be selected to avoid such interferences if an interference is inevitable a structural analysis of the block that is based on the contact forces should be performed if the wire rope is represented by a continuum model the collision can be simulated using a collisional calculation between the rigid and flexible bodies choi 2009 suggested an algorithm for the contact force calculation of the flexible body and applied it to flexible multibody dynamics fmbd in his study the compliance contact force model that was suggested by hertz 1882 was used lugris et al 2010 performed a simulation of the cable and pulley interaction using the continuum mechanics approach of the cable however the continuum model of the wire rope requires a high computational cost and it is numerically unstable when it is applied to shipyard processes due to the heavy lifting load servin et al 2011 presented a new wire rope model for which the quasistatic massless cable approach is combined with the multibody chain the wire ropes were modeled using several lumped mass particles that were connected to distance constraints then if the wire rope interfered with a body a massless frictional node was inserted into the wire rope 3 3 simulation scenario the production process in the shipyard depends on the properties of the ships and the offshore structures it is a complicated process and each case is different moreover the scenario management is an important issue for the simulation most of the process consists of event based sequences thus the discrete event system specification devs formalism is widely used for the scenario management cha et al 2010b developed the simulation framework for the dynamic analysis of the production process in the shipyard using combined discrete events and the discrete time simulation kernel ha et al 2016 adopted the scenario manager concept for shipbuilding production and they improved the modularity and the extensibility by using the devs formalism 4 applications for ships and offshore structures according to the recent demand increases various physics based simulations of ships and offshore structures have previously been performed this section reviews the previous studies on the dynamic analyses of the multibody systems that have been applied to various examples in the ship and offshore industries the applications were divided into the following three categories design and operation production and installation and decommissioning 4 1 design and operation as the demand for new concepts of ships and offshore structures is increasing a dynamic analysis is required at the initial design procedure for the design of the ships and offshore structures the potential risks during the operation should be evaluated in advance in this section the previous studies on the design and operation of ships and offshore structures based on multibody dynamics are presented in the case of offshore structures such as drilling rigs a failure during the drilling operation can lead to severe accidents therefore in terms of operational safety more attention needs to be directed toward the dynamic behavior of the structures and the equipment during the drilling operation in the most researches on the design and operation application the accurate motion analyses through detailed modeling of the offshore structures based on the multibody dynamics have been carried out firstly the equipment in the offshore structures such as heave compensator and riser tensioner system which multiple objects are interconnected are modeled kim et al 2016 simulated a heave compensator of an oil pressure system using multibody dynamics and it was verified by a comparison with the result of a test for which an actual miniature model was utilized in their study the heave compensator system was built by combining an active heave compensator ahc system with four drill string compensator dsc cylinders and a piston accumulator lee et al 2015 analyzed the dynamic response of the riser and a wireline riser tensioner wrt system in an offshore drilling rig the wrt system consists of several pneumatic cylinders that were modeled using nonlinear springs and the riser was modeled using a stiff spring in this way through the multibody dynamics the motion analysis during the operation was performed more accurately and this could be reflected in the design procedure of the offshore structures meanwhile due to the characteristics of the marine environment it is very important to calculate the external forces acting on the risers and the mooring lines and to predict the motion of them in addition to this the elasticity of the mooring line and the riser should be considered hong 2016 extended the research by lee et al 2015 to a flexible riser that was modeled using several pieces of flexible elements to consider the riser deformation then he analyzed the coupled motion of the riser and the drilling rig by using flexible multibody dynamics recently gurugubelli et al 2017 suggested the partitioned iterative formulation to simulate the fluid structure interaction of an offshore structure with riser and mooring lines in an incompressible turbulent flow the riser and mooring lines are modeled with flexible bodies and the coupling of the fluid surface elements and the line elements for the flexible bodies is proposed then the flow induced vibration of an offshore structure with riser and mooring system is simulated due to the growing interest in renewable resources such as wind power offshore wind turbines owt are attracting attention however the owt design requires a dynamic simulation for which complicated modeling and calculation processes must be performed in advance recently multibody dynamics were used to analyze the behavior of the owt which consists of several bodies such as a platform tower nacelle hub and blades besides the dynamic response of the owt is due to the oceanic environmental loads that are in consideration of the aerodynamics and the hydrodynamics therefore the more generalized simulation has been performed by integrating these environmental loads to the multibody system ku et al 2011 developed a multibody dynamics kernel for the owt using a recursive formulation the developed kernel includes several modules for the calculation of a hydrostatic force in consideration of the nonlinear effects a linearized hydrodynamic force from the use of the 3d rankine panel method a mooring force and an aerodynamic force for which the blade element momentum theory was used for the blades in the case of a detailed external load calculation leble and barakos 2016a 2016b presented a detailed simulation using a coupling algorithm that combines two navier stokes solvers in their studies the aerodynamic force was computed using a cfd simulation for which the helicopter multi block solver that was developed at liverpool university was utilized barakos et al 2005 also the sea was modeled using the sph method and the mooring lines were modeled as a set of springs and dampers wang 2012 wang and sweetman 2012 and sweetman and wang 2012 developed a new dynamic method for the rigid body owt by using a calculation of various external loads to achieve a combination for which the structural dynamics method was applied the considered nonlinear external loads are the hydrodynamic mooring and aerodynamic forces the multibody dynamics which form the computational core was solved by using the momentum conservation principle meanwhile the new formulation for multibody systems called the momentum cloud method mcm was derived to analyze the motion of the wind turbine which consists of complicated joints the broad application work was significantly generalized by wang and sweetman 2013 to various types of interconnected dynamic mechanical systems in their further work sweetman and wang 2014 derived the extended mcm for the multibody system with complicated forms and joints then the mcm was verified by comparing the simulation results for a compliant wind turbine model with those that were computed using other multibody dynamics software more recently the researches focused on the elasticity of the bodies that comprise the wind turbine in addition to consider the elasticity of the bodies the tower and blades of the offshore wind turbine were modeled as flexible components by zhu and woo 2016 who used the hybrid method of a finite element multibody system the effect of the elastic deformations of the tower and blades was investigated by comparing the simulation results with those of the rigid body modeling park et al 2017 employed flexible multibody dynamics to consider the deformation of the tower and the blades the 3d beam element was used to model the elastic bodies lastly the modeling and simulation of other offshore machines and equipment have been performed pawlus et al 2014 modeled the subsystem of offshore drilling equipment and benchmarked full scale machinery the simplified model with a mass and a drum winch system was established the simulation result was demonstrated using field data through an identification of the friction phenomenon in the system and a comparison of the simulation results with real world measurements dai et al 2016 established a multibody dynamic model of a total vehicle pipeline ship system for deep ocean mining a dynamic model of a seafloor mining vehicle was developed through an integration of the terramechanics model of the seafloor sediment for the modeling of a mining pipeline the discrete element method dem was employed in this section various applications of the multibody system for the design and operation of ships and offshore structures are presented the application examples can be divided into the offshore structure wind turbine and other offshore machines and equipment the applications of the design and operation simulation based on the multibody dynamics have been generally focused on the wind turbine and the equipment of offshore structures and subsystems are currently under the active research as for the research area by modeling the complicated structures detail using multibody dynamics the accurate motion analysis has been carried out for this the complicated joints in the structures and the equipment are modeled and the elasticity of the bodies are considered more recently the formulation of the multibody system has been integrated with various solvers for the calculation of external forces considering hydrodynamics aerodynamics terramechanics and so on in addition there are some attempts to transform and improve the formulation of the multibody system such as mcm and the hybrid method of a finite element multibody system 4 2 production ship and offshore structures are constructed using on dock cranes that join several blocks which are the basic production units in shipbuilding the production process includes the lifting transportation and erection operations of the blocks for the safety of the process an accurate modeling and simulation are required through a real situation representation in the shipyard several types of cranes such as the gantry crane the jib crane and the floating crane are used according to the mechanical system of the cranes and the environmental loads on them various production process modeling methods for which the cranes are used have been suggested bak and hansen 2013 presented an extensive model of a knuckle boom crane that would be used for the pipe handling on an offshore drilling rig the mechanical system was modeled as a multibody system that includes the main components of the crane s electrohydraulic actuation system the experiment data and parametric identification were used to verify the crane model he et al 2014 proposed a model for an offshore crane based on a rigid flexible coupling virtual prototyping the parts of the boom system of the crane were modeled as flexible bodies and the components such as the hook pulley and winch were modeled as rigid bodies vorhölter et al 2014 developed a universal crane model for the design of a floating crane that can be adapted to different crane types and lifting operations the kinematic model of the crane was set up by using a multibody system that contains rigid bodies and kinematic constraints for such applications a detailed crane model for the knuckle boom crane on an ocv was presented then the multi hook operation wherein the floating crane is lifting an offshore structure was simulated in addition to the modeling of the crane and equipment for the production the calculation of the external forces in the marine environment is also an important issue as part of the same project hatecke et al 2014 analyzed the heavy lifting operations of the floating crane in short crested waves for this purpose a sea keeping simulation method for the floating crane and a suspended load was developed based on multibody dynamics then the method was applied to evaluate the seakeeping capabilities of the floating crane during the lifting operation finally vorhölter et al 2015 extended their work regarding the developed crane model vorhölter et al 2014 and the seakeeping tools hatecke et al 2014 to typical lifting operations for the offshore wind industry the nonlinear seakeeping simulations were performed for lifting operations with three different cranes as a result the recommendations were derived with regard to the operational limits of the existing cranes and for the design of future cranes meanwhile ha et al 2015 considered the oceanic environmental loads on the floating crane using the mps method to describe their simulation of the shipyard heavy load lifting operation they integrated multibody dynamics with the mps method in some production process cases turnover operations are necessary to rotate the blocks in turnover operation it is important to check the interference between the block and the wire rope and calculate the contact force to avoid the potential risks in advance jo et al 2012 performed a block turnover simulation in consideration of the contact between the block and the wire ropes a method for calculating the contact force and the frictional force that are caused by the contacts was introduced based on multibody dynamics a wire rope model that is composed of many lumped masses that are connected to the wire rope segments was suggested then a contact node was inserted in the location where the wire rope interferes with the block lee et al 2016b simulated the block turnover using the constraint based wire rope the contact algorithm of the wire rope which includes the procedures of contact detection wire splitting force calculation and wire mergence was introduced meanwhile various multibody system formulations were used for the simulation of the production process cha et al 2010b automatically formulated coupled equations of the floating crane and cargo motions by using the topological modeling approach of multibody dynamics here the automation of the embedding technique formulation was presented ku et al 2014 used the recursive formulation for the dynamic response analysis of multicranes for block lifting ham et al 2015 analyzed the motion of heavy loads that were suspended by a floating crane using the constraint based wire rope the del equation of the multibody system was automatically formulated as the existing software programs are not suitable to represent the production process for which the characteristics that explained in section 3 are considered the dynamic analysis programs for the design production and installation of ships and offshore structures have been developed ku et al 2014 developed a multibody dynamics simulator for the process simulation of ships and offshore structures the simulator consists of the following six kernels multibody dynamics kernel force calculation kernel numerical analysis kernel hybrid simulation kernel scenario management kernel and collision detection kernel a variety of the process simulation cases in the ship and offshore industries were simulated using this simulator similarly park et al 2016 developed a program named simson simulation system of new production planning that calculates the motions of lifted blocks and floating bodies such as floating cranes in consideration of the hydrostatic and hydrodynamic forces meanwhile ham et al 2017b developed a program dedicated to the mega floating crane that supports some of the mechanical equipment items that are essential in the modeling of the mega floating crane similar to the design and operation simulation the detailed modeling of the equipment for the production based on the multibody system and the interaction with various environmental loads have been studied in production simulation especially in order to evaluate the potential risks of using a special production method such as block turnover the additional issues such as the contact between the body and the wire rope have been considered meanwhile in the production process it is often required before the operation that the operator should urgently check whether the operation is available or not by the numerical simulation for this reason several software programs that are specialized for the modeling and the dynamic analysis of the production simulations have been developed for this the researches on the automatic formulation of each kind of the equation of motion for the multibody system have been carried out recently new production methods have been implemented in shipyards to increase the production efficiency and to reduce time as future research the production simulations that have not been performed can be carried out such as transportation load out operation or the structural analysis based on the collision between bodies 4 3 installation and decommissioning nowadays as drilling and production facilities are located in offshore locations the installation and decommissioning of heavy offshore structures is a major challenge the installation methods for offshore structures have accordingly developed over time and either of the following two main methods are used lift barge method and float over method in the lift barge method the offshore crane is deployed to lift transport and install the topside of the offshore structures on the fixed substructure the float over method is another cost effective alternative method that transports the topside on a semisubmersible vessel and it then allows the vessel to submerge itself under the water to lower the topside onto the substructure meanwhile the decommissioning is the removal of the topside on fixed substructures the decommissioning methods can be divided into the following three methods piece small removal method reverse installation method and single lift removal method the piece small removal method cuts each component of the offshore structures into small pieces for their transportation the reverse installation method separates each module that comprises the topside from the substructure and lifts it using a heavy floating crane also called a heavy lift vessel or a semisubmersible crane vessel in reverse of the installation sequence lastly the single lift removal method uses a vessel to lift off the topside in one piece as with other shipyard processes the installation process of offshore structures should be analyzed to increase the safety and efficiency sun et al 2012 investigated the interaction effects that are due to diffractions by the large volume substructures and the floating barge during the float over installation for this the linear potential flow theory was used and a two stage formulation was adopted to analyze the multibody system involving the multibody wave diffraction and radiation in the two stage formulation the hydrodynamics problem was solved first without any constraint between the bodies and then the motion equations of the multibody system were formulated varieties of the substructural configurations were investigated for the installation cha et al 2013 performed a safety analysis of the installation process of an offshore structure for which floating cranes and a floating barge were used the dynamic responses of the offshore structure floating cranes floating barge and mooring system were analyzed based on multibody dynamics and the collisional potential among them was detected to verify the safety of the process a proportional derivative pd control of the tagline between the cranes and the offshore structure was performed and this is also for the reductions of the dynamic response and the collisions among them cha et al 2016 extended the research to analyze the installation process of an offshore structure that uses dual floating cranes additionally the control forces of the joint and the winch were considered to control the crane booms using a proportional integral derivative pid controller zhao et al 2018 performed anti sway control of a crane on an offshore support vessel used for the transportation and installation of heavy load at sea the hils hardware in the loop simulation is adopted which consists of a virtual mechanical system a virtual actuator and a sensor and a hardware controller for the crane control a pid controller and sliding mode control methods are developed meanwhile for a realistic simulation hong et al 2016 analyzed the offshore support vessel osv installation of subsea equipment based on flexible multibody dynamics the deformation of the crane boom that was considered is based on a finite element formulation a decommissioning operation that is based on multibody dynamics was simulated by wang 2015 a time domain analysis was performed to simulate the dynamic behavior of a floating crane in this study the topside removal method for which a twin barges system with lift off equipment was utilized was analyzed the twin barges system which contains two hinged rigid bars that connect the twin barges was considered as a multibody system then the dynamic behavior of the twin barges system was analyzed at different stages using the time domain approach which combines the motion equations with the system identification method of the fluid memory effect the modeling of the equipment and the integration with the solvers for the external forces are one of the main research areas in installation and decommissioning simulation in addition since the installation of the offshore structures are generally operated in a remote ocean and sophisticated control considering the collision is required the researches on the crane control under the hydrodynamic forces are actively carried out on the other hand there are not many types of research on the application of the decommissioning operation as the most offshore structures especially at the north sea have operated for more than twenty years it is expected that the demand on the dynamic simulation of the offshore decommissioning operation will highly increase 5 conclusion in this study recent studies that are related to the multibody dynamics in the ship and offshore industries have been reviewed the basic concept of multibody dynamics was introduced and some of the physical components that were applied to the various processes for ships and offshore structures were suggested then related studies on the applications of multibody dynamics in the field were presented it is evident that the applications of the most published works are limited to the major procedures of design production and installation for further research various simulations that have not yet been performed such as transportation and the load out operation for ships and offshore structures could be applied furthermore the simulations that are related to offshore accidents such as ship flooding wreck removal and riser and mooring disconnection could be considered in addition multibody dynamics can be integrated with various areas such as cfd structural analyses and control algorithms lastly as the multibody system for complicated processes consists of many bodies and constraints the corresponding analysis requires a high computational cost therefore computational methods such as parallel computing and graphics processing unit gpu assistance

23088,a review of the multibody dynamics in the applications of ships and offshore structures is presented in this study as the processes for the design and production of ships and offshore structures become various and complicated some physics based simulations that are based on multibody dynamics have been performed in the ship and offshore industries due to the characteristics of the processes some physical components such as connections and collisions should be taken into account to reflect real situations in this paper the physical components for multibody dynamics that should be considered for the design and production of ships and offshore structures are presented then the studies on the physics based simulations for the design production and installation processes and the decommissioning procedure are reviewed lastly several research directions are discussed in the conclusion graphical abstract image 1 keywords multibody dynamics physics based simulation ship and offshore structures 1 introduction the demand regarding the physics based simulations for the design and production of ships and offshore structures is consistently increasing so that the potential risks can be checked in advance for example as the process for the production of such structures in the shipyard becomes more diverse and complicated the performance of simulations that have not been tried previously are required furthermore to improve the safety and efficiency of the process a detailed modeling for the simulation is necessary to reflect real situations accurately which is impossible with conventional modeling methods the general processes for ships and offshore structures can be classified into the following three procedures according to the purpose of the simulation design production and installation or decommissioning figs 1 3 show examples of each procedure for which simulations are required as is presented the processes for ships and offshore structures can be represented as a multibody system which consists of several bodies that are connected by joints or wire ropes therefore a physics based simulation that is based on multibody dynamics should be performed in the ship and offshore industries a simplified model is mostly used to analyze the dynamic response of a given system for example fig 4 shows simplified and realistic models of a floating crane that lifts a block the simplified model that is shown in fig 4 a includes only the crane barge and the block that are connected by one wire rope which has the equivalent stiffness to a group of wire ropes in b the realistic multibody model of fig 4 b contains hooks and block loaders with additional multiple wire ropes for the same condition the weight and the inertia of the floating barge in the simplified model are same as those of the floating crane including jibs in the realistic model in the simplified model the wire rope is connected to the barge to the point that is fixed to the local coordinate of the barge the block weight is 5000 t and the wave condition is set at a wave height of 1 0 m a wave period of 10 s and a heading angle of 90 table 1 shows a comparison of the results according to two models the error percentage was calculated based on the realistic model method the sway roll and yaw motions of the floating crane are major differences due to the heading angle of the wave as is presented the result shows major differences due to the modeling effect although the mass and the inertia of the block are the same all of the block motions except for the heave show major differences this result implies that it is necessary to perform the motion analysis based on a multibody system realistic model multibody dynamics is a broad field of study under active research in the ship and offshore industries due to the characteristics of the complicated processes and the environmental conditions several physical components should be considered as shown in figs 1 3 firstly due to the oceanic environment external forces such as waves currents and winds should be considered when a body such as a block a structure and the other equipment of ships and offshore structures is lifted by a crane the wind force is also taken into consideration since its size may be immense besides the connections between it and the crane such as the wire ropes mooring lines and equalizers or block loaders should be considered here an equalizer is used to equally distribute the tensions acting on each wire rope of the crane as the crane lifting body may be heavy an accurate analysis of the connection between the body and the crane is required to prevent an accident lastly the collision between the body and the crane should be analyzed in the production and installation procedures a collision between the body and the crane or between the body and the wire rope often occurs therefore the collisional potential needs to be checked for and if it exists it needs to be determined whether the collisional force exceeds the allowable value or not so far various studies on physics based simulations in the ship and offshore industries have been conducted in this study the basic concept of the multibody system is introduced in consideration of several components due to the characteristics of the processes for the design and production of ships and offshore structures then the related studies on the physics based simulations that are based on multibody dynamics are reviewed 2 multibody system in this section the basic concept and the theoretical background of the multibody system are briefly introduced the multibody system is a system that consists of joint connected multiple bodies to analyze the dynamic behavior of the multibody system the equations of the motion containing the multiple bodies and the joints should be constructed and solved with external forces 2 1 modeling 2 1 1 body a body that makes up a multibody system can be divided into either a rigid or a flexible body depending on whether it is deformable or not the rigid body motions do not generate strains whereas the elastic motions generate strain fields the area of multibody dynamics was originally developed as a tool for the modeling of rigid multibody systems but it has considerably evolved so that it can now handle linearly and nonlinearly flexible multibody systems that comprise both rigid and flexible bodies bauchau 2011 2 1 2 joints in this study a joint is defined as a kinematic constraint between two bodies featherstone 2008 therefore the joints that connect two bodies impose restrictions on the relative motion of each of the bodies the joint can be categorized according to the motion that is allowed by the joint in three dimensional 3d space an unconstrained rigid body has six degrees of freedom dofs as follows translational and rotational motions that are about the three independent axes x y and z several common types of joints are shown in table 2 a detailed explanation and the mathematical description of each joint are presented in ham et al 2015 2 1 3 forces the motion of a body can be obtained by solving the newton euler equation using the given external forces also if two bodies are connected by a joint constraint forces are exerted onto both bodies to restrict the relative motion between them therefore for the motion analysis of a multibody system both the external and constraint forces should be taken into account however it is very complicated to calculate the constraint forces and it is difficult to apply the newton euler equation directly for those reasons a specific formulation of the motion equations is required for a multibody system 2 2 formulation to describe the motion of the multibody system various formulations have previously been suggested since the step of the finding of the constraint forces regarding multibody dynamics is very complicated shabana 1994 divided the formulations into two according to the constraint force consideration method as follows embedding technique and augmented formulation in addition lacoursière 2007 formulated the discrete euler lagrange del equation that is derived from the discretization of the euler lagrange equation other alternative approaches for the formulation of the motion equations of the multibody system are recursive methods shabana 1994 in this section each multibody system formulation is explained and the final form of the motion equations is described 2 2 1 embedding technique the formulations for the multibody system can be divided according to the constraint force consideration method the embedding technique that eliminates the constraint forces and is expressed regarding the independent coordinates is expressed as follows amirouche 1992 shabana 1994 1998 1 m q k q q f e m j t m j k j t m j q f e j t f e where m is the mass matrix q is the generalized coordinates f e is the external forces and j is the velocity transformation matrix between the absolute and generalized coordinates generally the embedding technique requires a minor computational cost because it allows the elimination of the dependent coordinates however an autonomic formulation of the motion equations is complicated and the constraint forces cannot be calculated zhao et al 2018 and cha et al 2010b applied embedding techniques to analyze the motion of ships and offshore structures 2 2 2 augmented formulation different from the embedding technique the augmented formulation adopts lagrange multipliers to calculate the constraint forces and the body coordinates are maintained in the augmented formulation the kinematic constraint equations are adjoined to the system dynamic differential equations using the technique of the lagrange multipliers wehage 1980 the augmented formulation is described as follows amirouche 1992 shabana 1994 1997 1998 2 m c r t c r 0 r λ f e c r r where r is the absolute coordinate c r is the constraint jacobian and λ is the lagrange multiplier the augmented formulation can be automatically generated with respect to the constraints and the external forces also the constraint forces can be calculated using the lagrange multipliers however it requires a high computational cost as the body number increases because all of the body coordinates are maintained 2 2 3 discrete euler lagrange equation lacoursière 2007 formulated the del equation by using regularized stabilized and variational methods for the multibody system the del equation is derived from the discretization step of the euler lagrange equation together with the application of the finite differential method that was studied by wendlandt and marsden 1997 marsden and west 2001 and lew 2003 equation 3 shows the final form of the del equation as follows 3 m c r t c r γ 4 ε h 2 v λ m v h f e 4 γ h c γ c r v where c is the constraints h is the step size γ is the stabilization constant and ε is the regularization constant the del equation can be automatically formulated and the constraint force calculation is similar to the augmented formulation but it contains the velocity rather than the acceleration ham et al 2015 applied the del equation to a number of examples in the ship and offshore industries 2 2 4 recursive newton euler formulation in the recursive newton euler formulation book 1984 changizi and shabana 1988 pereira and proenca 1991 the equations of motion are formulated regarding the joint dofs which lead to an automatic elimination of the workless constraint forces therefore the numerical procedure for the solving of these equations is much simpler than that of the other formulations the recursive newton euler formulation is expressed as follows featherstone 2008 shabana 1997 4 m i s i q i s i f i e f i c v i v i 1 s i q i a i a i 1 s i q i s i q i f i b i i a i v i i i v i f i f i b f i e f i 1 where s is the modified generalized coordinate s is the velocity transformation matrix i is the mass and the mass moment of inertia f b is the resultant force f e is the external force f is the force that is exerted on the joint and i indicates the ith body the transfer matrix method of the multibody system mstmm was developed by rui et al 2016 in the same way the recursive methods and the mstmm can be applied to the multibody system with a large number of bodies as they require only a minor computational cost however they cannot be applied directly to the closed loop systems which has a circuit of bodies such that the closed circuit can be traced through the system from one body to another and returns to the original body without traversing any body more than once roberson and schwertassek 1988 2 3 simulation in this section the physics based simulation of the multibody system is explained the overall procedure for the performance of the physics based simulation of the multibody system is presented in fig 5 as the multibody system is modeled the mathematical model can be constructed with the initial modeling information of the bodies joints and forces the equations of motion that are based on the newton euler equation form a basic theoretical background for the physics based simulation then the various formulations for multibody dynamics such as the augmented formulation embedding technique recursive newton euler formulation and del equation can be adopted as a result of the motion equation the acceleration x is obtained then the acceleration is numerically integrated to find the velocity x and the position x a variety of integration methods such as the adams bashforth method runge kutta method and stomer verlet method exist the external forces are then calculated using the calculated velocity and position of each body the total sum of the external forces will be the input of the motion equation in the next time step 3 multibody system in ships and offshore structures in the ship and offshore industries a number of essential components should be considered for the modeling and simulation of the corresponding processes in this section a modeling problem of the multibody system for ships and offshore structures is defined and a review of some of the related studies is performed 3 1 connection in the production and installation of ships and offshore structures the bodies are connected to each other with various equipment items not only the kinematic joints as explained in section 2 for an example of the floating crane block lifting operation a block is connected to the boom of a crane with several wire ropes and equalizers and the crane is moored to the quay and the seabed with several mooring lines also fenders are located between the crane and the quay to prevent a collision between them thus various connection types are present between the bodies and the modeling should be accurate according to the purpose of the simulation 3 1 1 wire rope the wire rope is one of the most common connection types between bodies in the ship and offshore industries a set of wire ropes is used to lift heavy objects such as a block or a structure the simplest way to represent the wire rope in a physics based simulation is to model it as an incompressible spring in this case the wire rope exerts forces onto both of the connected bodies when it is stretched and this is included as an external force of the multibody system however the modeling of the wire rope as an external force is not suitable for the representation of the various characteristics of the wire rope in some cases the three properties of real wire ropes are stretching bending and twisting while the incompressible spring can only represent stretching servin and lacoursiere 2007 2008 introduced a constraint based wire rope to model a more realistic wire rope here the wire rope is expressed as a kinematic constraint connecting two bodies then the constraint forces play the roles of stretching bending and twisting forces also the constraint based wire rope can represent the interbody contacts therefore some sophisticated equipment for which fixed and moving pulleys are utilized can be modeled with the constraint based wire rope pai 2002 modeled the wire rope with thin solids based on the cosserat theory lugris et al 2010 used the absolute nodal coordinate formulation ancf of shabana 1998 to model the wire rope and compared the result with that of the analytical method the continuum model of the wire rope is suitable for a representation of the various characteristics of a real wire rope however it increases the complexity of the system and requires a high computational cost 3 1 2 equalizer in the shipyard cranes such as the floating crane and the gantry crane are equipped with several hooks to lift heavy blocks or any other structures the numerous lifting points of the block disperse the weight while there is a limited number of hooks thus an equalizer or a block loader is connected to the hook of the crane to connect several wire ropes to one hook the equalizer is composed of several fixed and moving pulleys that are connected with one wire rope as each moving pulley moves up and down the tension of each wire rope is distributed equally cha et al 2010a used an approximated mechanism to represent the equalizer here as the wire ropes are modeled with incompressible springs the fixed and moving pulleys could not be modeled and the wire ropes are directly connected to the body of the equalizer then the length of each wire rope was stretched or shortened to distribute the tension equally the application of this mechanism is quite simple but a number of disadvantages are influential firstly it may cause numerically unstable problems due to the sudden change of the lengths of the wire ropes also this mechanism requires an artificial factor to control the change rate of the wire rope which can affect the systemic motion lastly the total length that can be extended or shortened is not controllable while it is limited in the real world ham et al 2016 introduced a more realistic equalizer model using the constraint based wire rope in their study the equalizer is modeled based on a real mechanism and the constant length constraint was used to model the wire rope that connects the fixed and moving pulleys then the model was applied to the typical lifting cases in the shipyard production process 3 1 3 mooring line most of the floating unit processes such as floating cranes and floating barges consist of a mooring system to maintain the unit positions the modeling of the mooring system plays an important role in the prediction of the unit responses and the loads on the mooring lines the following two types of the mooring system exist depending on the environmental condition and the purpose of the units taut mooring and catenary mooring taut mooring can be modeled as a massless wire rope as it uses the tension of the line rather than its weight while catenary mooring exerts forces based on its weight the three primary model types for the mooring analysis are as follows catenary model lumped mass model and finite element model tang et al 2009 the analytic approach for the calculation of the mooring force that is based on the self weight of a mooring line was introduced by faltinsen 1990 the catenary model is a quasistatic model that calculates the profile and the tension of the mooring line using analytical equations that are based on the assumption of the static equilibrium state this is a popular simple approach for the modeling of the mooring system but it is hampered by some usage restrictions the main disadvantage is that the hydrodynamic and inertial forces on the mooring line cannot be considered another approach for mooring line modeling is the lumped mass approach the lumped mass approach concentrates the mass and hydrodynamic forces at the nodes that are located at the end of each mooring line segment then the nodes are connected by massless springs that can simulate the stretching of the mooring line this approach was first suggested by walton and polachek 1959 and was later developed by khan and ansari 1986 in three dimensions recently hall and goupee 2015 introduced the extended lumped mass mooring model and validated it against semisubmersible model test data however for a system with multiple mooring lines the lumped mass approach appears as an inopportune approach for programming ma et al 2015 with these disadvantages of the catenary model and the lumped mass model the finite element method fem has become more popular an fem for the mooring system that considers the elastic deformation was presented by bathe 2014 garret 1982 advanced the elastic rod finite element model with a linear elasticity and the elastic rod method has been widely used in the analysis of slender components such as the mooring line riser and pipeline hong and hong 1997 and garrett 2005 developed numerical schemes for the mooring analysis and applied them in the field of ocean engineering more recently kim et al 2010 2013 analyzed the behavior of the elastic catenary system using a nonlinear fem and extended the research to the multibody system 3 1 4 fender in the shipyard when a vessel is moored to the quay or berthed next to another vessel the fender is used to prevent collisional damage the fender system absorbs the collisional energy during a collision with a vessel resulting in nonlinear behavior in the physics based simulation the fender can be simply represented as an external force using a nonlinear spring the maximum reaction force of the fender is determined by various factors such as the collisional angle velocity and temperature then the ratio of the reaction force can be obtained by an experiment that is based on the deflection length accordingly the fender can be represented as a nonlinear spring whose stiffness changes according to the deflection length and it exerts forces when it is compressed 3 2 collision in the production and installation processes the collisions between bodies or between a body and wire ropes frequently occur in some cases the outfitting of the block can be damaged due to collisions with wire ropes or other structures and if the contact force of the structure exceeds the allowable value an accident can be caused the collisional analysis should be done before the execution of the processes to prevent such risks 3 2 1 interbody collisions the need for the collisional analysis that has not been tried previously is increasing for example in the block erection or lifting off operations the block or structures are laid down onto the existing hull structures or the floating barge as shown in fig 6 in these processes collision is a major consideration the collisional processing including the collisional detection and the rigid body response are two of the most difficult areas in the simulation of the multibody system in this section the most popular collision processing techniques are presented and the applications in the ship and offshore industries are introduced the collisional processing can be divided into the following two procedures collisional detection and collisional response the collisional detection is a geometric problem of colliding objects the collisional detection between bodies and the contact computation have been presented by teschner et al 2005 extended works on the discrete and continuous methods for the checking of the collisional potential or penetration were introduced by erleben 2004 at a broad level the following two methods are commonly used in the collisional response schmucker et al 2007 impulse based method mirtich 1996 and force based method baraff 1992 moore and wilhelms 1988 the impulse based method uses the collisional impulses between the bodies and changes the velocity of the bodies during the contact in consideration of the impulse conservation law the main advantages of this method are the need for only a few constants for the description of the impulse conservation law and the absence of a response calculation influence on the integrator step size because it is performed during an infinitely small time instant schmucker et al 2007 also this method is computationally efficient for systems that contain many bodies however as it changes the velocity directly the traditional ordinary differential equation ode solver cannot be used therefore for the multibody system that consists of bodies that are connected by joints the impulse based method is not applicable jeong et al 2016 applied this method for a collisional analysis of the lift off simulation but only a single body was considered as the colliding body the force based method or the penalty based method is based on the separation forces that are caused by the penetration of colliding bodies the calculation of the collisional force is a difficult problem and a number of existing methods can be applied one method is the force based method with a penalty formulation for which a nonlinear spring and a damper are used the virtual spring and the damper system are modeled between the bodies when they collide and the spring forces act as collisional forces this method is simple it is applicable to the multibody system and it can be easily extended to the handling of soft bodies however the main disadvantages are the existence of various collisional parameters for the modeling of the spring damper system and the absence of general approaches for the selection of the parameters that match the physical laws besides the collisional detection is a major problem because the penetration depth and point should be computed lee et al 2016a used this method for the collisional analysis of a block erection operation the other approach to calculate the collisional force is the force based method for which a constraint using lagrange multiplier formulation is used the collision between bodies is modeled in terms of mechanical constraints and the reaction forces act as collisional forces ham et al 2017a analyzed the collision of the subsea equipment on an offshore supply vessel osv using noninterpenetration constraints the bodies were represented by continuously differentiable functions and the equations of motion were reformulated using noninterpenetration constraints 3 2 2 collision between a body and a wire rope as shown in fig 7 the block turnover operation by cranes often causes an interference between the block and the wire ropes if the contact forces that are exerted on the block and the wire ropes exceed the allowable value the block and the wire ropes can be damaged therefore before the actual execution the block lug points should be selected to avoid such interferences if an interference is inevitable a structural analysis of the block that is based on the contact forces should be performed if the wire rope is represented by a continuum model the collision can be simulated using a collisional calculation between the rigid and flexible bodies choi 2009 suggested an algorithm for the contact force calculation of the flexible body and applied it to flexible multibody dynamics fmbd in his study the compliance contact force model that was suggested by hertz 1882 was used lugris et al 2010 performed a simulation of the cable and pulley interaction using the continuum mechanics approach of the cable however the continuum model of the wire rope requires a high computational cost and it is numerically unstable when it is applied to shipyard processes due to the heavy lifting load servin et al 2011 presented a new wire rope model for which the quasistatic massless cable approach is combined with the multibody chain the wire ropes were modeled using several lumped mass particles that were connected to distance constraints then if the wire rope interfered with a body a massless frictional node was inserted into the wire rope 3 3 simulation scenario the production process in the shipyard depends on the properties of the ships and the offshore structures it is a complicated process and each case is different moreover the scenario management is an important issue for the simulation most of the process consists of event based sequences thus the discrete event system specification devs formalism is widely used for the scenario management cha et al 2010b developed the simulation framework for the dynamic analysis of the production process in the shipyard using combined discrete events and the discrete time simulation kernel ha et al 2016 adopted the scenario manager concept for shipbuilding production and they improved the modularity and the extensibility by using the devs formalism 4 applications for ships and offshore structures according to the recent demand increases various physics based simulations of ships and offshore structures have previously been performed this section reviews the previous studies on the dynamic analyses of the multibody systems that have been applied to various examples in the ship and offshore industries the applications were divided into the following three categories design and operation production and installation and decommissioning 4 1 design and operation as the demand for new concepts of ships and offshore structures is increasing a dynamic analysis is required at the initial design procedure for the design of the ships and offshore structures the potential risks during the operation should be evaluated in advance in this section the previous studies on the design and operation of ships and offshore structures based on multibody dynamics are presented in the case of offshore structures such as drilling rigs a failure during the drilling operation can lead to severe accidents therefore in terms of operational safety more attention needs to be directed toward the dynamic behavior of the structures and the equipment during the drilling operation in the most researches on the design and operation application the accurate motion analyses through detailed modeling of the offshore structures based on the multibody dynamics have been carried out firstly the equipment in the offshore structures such as heave compensator and riser tensioner system which multiple objects are interconnected are modeled kim et al 2016 simulated a heave compensator of an oil pressure system using multibody dynamics and it was verified by a comparison with the result of a test for which an actual miniature model was utilized in their study the heave compensator system was built by combining an active heave compensator ahc system with four drill string compensator dsc cylinders and a piston accumulator lee et al 2015 analyzed the dynamic response of the riser and a wireline riser tensioner wrt system in an offshore drilling rig the wrt system consists of several pneumatic cylinders that were modeled using nonlinear springs and the riser was modeled using a stiff spring in this way through the multibody dynamics the motion analysis during the operation was performed more accurately and this could be reflected in the design procedure of the offshore structures meanwhile due to the characteristics of the marine environment it is very important to calculate the external forces acting on the risers and the mooring lines and to predict the motion of them in addition to this the elasticity of the mooring line and the riser should be considered hong 2016 extended the research by lee et al 2015 to a flexible riser that was modeled using several pieces of flexible elements to consider the riser deformation then he analyzed the coupled motion of the riser and the drilling rig by using flexible multibody dynamics recently gurugubelli et al 2017 suggested the partitioned iterative formulation to simulate the fluid structure interaction of an offshore structure with riser and mooring lines in an incompressible turbulent flow the riser and mooring lines are modeled with flexible bodies and the coupling of the fluid surface elements and the line elements for the flexible bodies is proposed then the flow induced vibration of an offshore structure with riser and mooring system is simulated due to the growing interest in renewable resources such as wind power offshore wind turbines owt are attracting attention however the owt design requires a dynamic simulation for which complicated modeling and calculation processes must be performed in advance recently multibody dynamics were used to analyze the behavior of the owt which consists of several bodies such as a platform tower nacelle hub and blades besides the dynamic response of the owt is due to the oceanic environmental loads that are in consideration of the aerodynamics and the hydrodynamics therefore the more generalized simulation has been performed by integrating these environmental loads to the multibody system ku et al 2011 developed a multibody dynamics kernel for the owt using a recursive formulation the developed kernel includes several modules for the calculation of a hydrostatic force in consideration of the nonlinear effects a linearized hydrodynamic force from the use of the 3d rankine panel method a mooring force and an aerodynamic force for which the blade element momentum theory was used for the blades in the case of a detailed external load calculation leble and barakos 2016a 2016b presented a detailed simulation using a coupling algorithm that combines two navier stokes solvers in their studies the aerodynamic force was computed using a cfd simulation for which the helicopter multi block solver that was developed at liverpool university was utilized barakos et al 2005 also the sea was modeled using the sph method and the mooring lines were modeled as a set of springs and dampers wang 2012 wang and sweetman 2012 and sweetman and wang 2012 developed a new dynamic method for the rigid body owt by using a calculation of various external loads to achieve a combination for which the structural dynamics method was applied the considered nonlinear external loads are the hydrodynamic mooring and aerodynamic forces the multibody dynamics which form the computational core was solved by using the momentum conservation principle meanwhile the new formulation for multibody systems called the momentum cloud method mcm was derived to analyze the motion of the wind turbine which consists of complicated joints the broad application work was significantly generalized by wang and sweetman 2013 to various types of interconnected dynamic mechanical systems in their further work sweetman and wang 2014 derived the extended mcm for the multibody system with complicated forms and joints then the mcm was verified by comparing the simulation results for a compliant wind turbine model with those that were computed using other multibody dynamics software more recently the researches focused on the elasticity of the bodies that comprise the wind turbine in addition to consider the elasticity of the bodies the tower and blades of the offshore wind turbine were modeled as flexible components by zhu and woo 2016 who used the hybrid method of a finite element multibody system the effect of the elastic deformations of the tower and blades was investigated by comparing the simulation results with those of the rigid body modeling park et al 2017 employed flexible multibody dynamics to consider the deformation of the tower and the blades the 3d beam element was used to model the elastic bodies lastly the modeling and simulation of other offshore machines and equipment have been performed pawlus et al 2014 modeled the subsystem of offshore drilling equipment and benchmarked full scale machinery the simplified model with a mass and a drum winch system was established the simulation result was demonstrated using field data through an identification of the friction phenomenon in the system and a comparison of the simulation results with real world measurements dai et al 2016 established a multibody dynamic model of a total vehicle pipeline ship system for deep ocean mining a dynamic model of a seafloor mining vehicle was developed through an integration of the terramechanics model of the seafloor sediment for the modeling of a mining pipeline the discrete element method dem was employed in this section various applications of the multibody system for the design and operation of ships and offshore structures are presented the application examples can be divided into the offshore structure wind turbine and other offshore machines and equipment the applications of the design and operation simulation based on the multibody dynamics have been generally focused on the wind turbine and the equipment of offshore structures and subsystems are currently under the active research as for the research area by modeling the complicated structures detail using multibody dynamics the accurate motion analysis has been carried out for this the complicated joints in the structures and the equipment are modeled and the elasticity of the bodies are considered more recently the formulation of the multibody system has been integrated with various solvers for the calculation of external forces considering hydrodynamics aerodynamics terramechanics and so on in addition there are some attempts to transform and improve the formulation of the multibody system such as mcm and the hybrid method of a finite element multibody system 4 2 production ship and offshore structures are constructed using on dock cranes that join several blocks which are the basic production units in shipbuilding the production process includes the lifting transportation and erection operations of the blocks for the safety of the process an accurate modeling and simulation are required through a real situation representation in the shipyard several types of cranes such as the gantry crane the jib crane and the floating crane are used according to the mechanical system of the cranes and the environmental loads on them various production process modeling methods for which the cranes are used have been suggested bak and hansen 2013 presented an extensive model of a knuckle boom crane that would be used for the pipe handling on an offshore drilling rig the mechanical system was modeled as a multibody system that includes the main components of the crane s electrohydraulic actuation system the experiment data and parametric identification were used to verify the crane model he et al 2014 proposed a model for an offshore crane based on a rigid flexible coupling virtual prototyping the parts of the boom system of the crane were modeled as flexible bodies and the components such as the hook pulley and winch were modeled as rigid bodies vorhölter et al 2014 developed a universal crane model for the design of a floating crane that can be adapted to different crane types and lifting operations the kinematic model of the crane was set up by using a multibody system that contains rigid bodies and kinematic constraints for such applications a detailed crane model for the knuckle boom crane on an ocv was presented then the multi hook operation wherein the floating crane is lifting an offshore structure was simulated in addition to the modeling of the crane and equipment for the production the calculation of the external forces in the marine environment is also an important issue as part of the same project hatecke et al 2014 analyzed the heavy lifting operations of the floating crane in short crested waves for this purpose a sea keeping simulation method for the floating crane and a suspended load was developed based on multibody dynamics then the method was applied to evaluate the seakeeping capabilities of the floating crane during the lifting operation finally vorhölter et al 2015 extended their work regarding the developed crane model vorhölter et al 2014 and the seakeeping tools hatecke et al 2014 to typical lifting operations for the offshore wind industry the nonlinear seakeeping simulations were performed for lifting operations with three different cranes as a result the recommendations were derived with regard to the operational limits of the existing cranes and for the design of future cranes meanwhile ha et al 2015 considered the oceanic environmental loads on the floating crane using the mps method to describe their simulation of the shipyard heavy load lifting operation they integrated multibody dynamics with the mps method in some production process cases turnover operations are necessary to rotate the blocks in turnover operation it is important to check the interference between the block and the wire rope and calculate the contact force to avoid the potential risks in advance jo et al 2012 performed a block turnover simulation in consideration of the contact between the block and the wire ropes a method for calculating the contact force and the frictional force that are caused by the contacts was introduced based on multibody dynamics a wire rope model that is composed of many lumped masses that are connected to the wire rope segments was suggested then a contact node was inserted in the location where the wire rope interferes with the block lee et al 2016b simulated the block turnover using the constraint based wire rope the contact algorithm of the wire rope which includes the procedures of contact detection wire splitting force calculation and wire mergence was introduced meanwhile various multibody system formulations were used for the simulation of the production process cha et al 2010b automatically formulated coupled equations of the floating crane and cargo motions by using the topological modeling approach of multibody dynamics here the automation of the embedding technique formulation was presented ku et al 2014 used the recursive formulation for the dynamic response analysis of multicranes for block lifting ham et al 2015 analyzed the motion of heavy loads that were suspended by a floating crane using the constraint based wire rope the del equation of the multibody system was automatically formulated as the existing software programs are not suitable to represent the production process for which the characteristics that explained in section 3 are considered the dynamic analysis programs for the design production and installation of ships and offshore structures have been developed ku et al 2014 developed a multibody dynamics simulator for the process simulation of ships and offshore structures the simulator consists of the following six kernels multibody dynamics kernel force calculation kernel numerical analysis kernel hybrid simulation kernel scenario management kernel and collision detection kernel a variety of the process simulation cases in the ship and offshore industries were simulated using this simulator similarly park et al 2016 developed a program named simson simulation system of new production planning that calculates the motions of lifted blocks and floating bodies such as floating cranes in consideration of the hydrostatic and hydrodynamic forces meanwhile ham et al 2017b developed a program dedicated to the mega floating crane that supports some of the mechanical equipment items that are essential in the modeling of the mega floating crane similar to the design and operation simulation the detailed modeling of the equipment for the production based on the multibody system and the interaction with various environmental loads have been studied in production simulation especially in order to evaluate the potential risks of using a special production method such as block turnover the additional issues such as the contact between the body and the wire rope have been considered meanwhile in the production process it is often required before the operation that the operator should urgently check whether the operation is available or not by the numerical simulation for this reason several software programs that are specialized for the modeling and the dynamic analysis of the production simulations have been developed for this the researches on the automatic formulation of each kind of the equation of motion for the multibody system have been carried out recently new production methods have been implemented in shipyards to increase the production efficiency and to reduce time as future research the production simulations that have not been performed can be carried out such as transportation load out operation or the structural analysis based on the collision between bodies 4 3 installation and decommissioning nowadays as drilling and production facilities are located in offshore locations the installation and decommissioning of heavy offshore structures is a major challenge the installation methods for offshore structures have accordingly developed over time and either of the following two main methods are used lift barge method and float over method in the lift barge method the offshore crane is deployed to lift transport and install the topside of the offshore structures on the fixed substructure the float over method is another cost effective alternative method that transports the topside on a semisubmersible vessel and it then allows the vessel to submerge itself under the water to lower the topside onto the substructure meanwhile the decommissioning is the removal of the topside on fixed substructures the decommissioning methods can be divided into the following three methods piece small removal method reverse installation method and single lift removal method the piece small removal method cuts each component of the offshore structures into small pieces for their transportation the reverse installation method separates each module that comprises the topside from the substructure and lifts it using a heavy floating crane also called a heavy lift vessel or a semisubmersible crane vessel in reverse of the installation sequence lastly the single lift removal method uses a vessel to lift off the topside in one piece as with other shipyard processes the installation process of offshore structures should be analyzed to increase the safety and efficiency sun et al 2012 investigated the interaction effects that are due to diffractions by the large volume substructures and the floating barge during the float over installation for this the linear potential flow theory was used and a two stage formulation was adopted to analyze the multibody system involving the multibody wave diffraction and radiation in the two stage formulation the hydrodynamics problem was solved first without any constraint between the bodies and then the motion equations of the multibody system were formulated varieties of the substructural configurations were investigated for the installation cha et al 2013 performed a safety analysis of the installation process of an offshore structure for which floating cranes and a floating barge were used the dynamic responses of the offshore structure floating cranes floating barge and mooring system were analyzed based on multibody dynamics and the collisional potential among them was detected to verify the safety of the process a proportional derivative pd control of the tagline between the cranes and the offshore structure was performed and this is also for the reductions of the dynamic response and the collisions among them cha et al 2016 extended the research to analyze the installation process of an offshore structure that uses dual floating cranes additionally the control forces of the joint and the winch were considered to control the crane booms using a proportional integral derivative pid controller zhao et al 2018 performed anti sway control of a crane on an offshore support vessel used for the transportation and installation of heavy load at sea the hils hardware in the loop simulation is adopted which consists of a virtual mechanical system a virtual actuator and a sensor and a hardware controller for the crane control a pid controller and sliding mode control methods are developed meanwhile for a realistic simulation hong et al 2016 analyzed the offshore support vessel osv installation of subsea equipment based on flexible multibody dynamics the deformation of the crane boom that was considered is based on a finite element formulation a decommissioning operation that is based on multibody dynamics was simulated by wang 2015 a time domain analysis was performed to simulate the dynamic behavior of a floating crane in this study the topside removal method for which a twin barges system with lift off equipment was utilized was analyzed the twin barges system which contains two hinged rigid bars that connect the twin barges was considered as a multibody system then the dynamic behavior of the twin barges system was analyzed at different stages using the time domain approach which combines the motion equations with the system identification method of the fluid memory effect the modeling of the equipment and the integration with the solvers for the external forces are one of the main research areas in installation and decommissioning simulation in addition since the installation of the offshore structures are generally operated in a remote ocean and sophisticated control considering the collision is required the researches on the crane control under the hydrodynamic forces are actively carried out on the other hand there are not many types of research on the application of the decommissioning operation as the most offshore structures especially at the north sea have operated for more than twenty years it is expected that the demand on the dynamic simulation of the offshore decommissioning operation will highly increase 5 conclusion in this study recent studies that are related to the multibody dynamics in the ship and offshore industries have been reviewed the basic concept of multibody dynamics was introduced and some of the physical components that were applied to the various processes for ships and offshore structures were suggested then related studies on the applications of multibody dynamics in the field were presented it is evident that the applications of the most published works are limited to the major procedures of design production and installation for further research various simulations that have not yet been performed such as transportation and the load out operation for ships and offshore structures could be applied furthermore the simulations that are related to offshore accidents such as ship flooding wreck removal and riser and mooring disconnection could be considered in addition multibody dynamics can be integrated with various areas such as cfd structural analyses and control algorithms lastly as the multibody system for complicated processes consists of many bodies and constraints the corresponding analysis requires a high computational cost therefore computational methods such as parallel computing and graphics processing unit gpu assistance could be applied for a future simulation acknowledgements this work was partially supported by a bk21 plus program education and research center for creative offshore plant engineers funded by the

23089,the design of owts relies on integrated load analyses tools that simulate the response of the entire owt including the rotor nacelle assembly support structure and foundation under combined aerodynamic and hydrodynamic loading despite all efforts to develop accurate integrated models these often fail to reproduce the measured natural frequencies partly due to the current foundation modelling this paper presents a new foundation model for integrated analyses of monopile based owts the model follows the macro element approach where the response of a pile and the surrounding soil is condensed to a force displacement relation at seabed the model formulation uses multi surface plasticity and it reproduces key characteristics in monopile foundation behaviour that are not accounted for in current industry practice the basic features of the model are described and its limitations are discussed the performance of the macro element model is compared against field test measurements and results from fea the comparison indicates that the macro element model can reproduce accurately the non linear load displacement response and hysteretic behaviour measured in field tests and computed in fea this confirms that the model can simulate the pile and soil behaviour with the same level of accuracy as fea but with a considerable reduction in computational effort keywords offshore wind turbine pile foundation soil structure interaction foundation damping load calculation methods macro element model 1 introduction designing offshore wind turbines is a complex task as these are dynamic systems subjected to variable cyclic loads fatigue often drives the design and therefore dynamic structural analyses are mandatory det norske veritas 2014 dynamic structural analyses are based on integrated load simulations of several design load cases vorpahl et al 2013 and they are generally performed in the time domain det norske veritas 2014 an integrated analysis of an owt refers to the analysis of an entire owt i e rotor nacelle assembly support structure and foundation under combined aerodynamic and hydrodynamic loading and requires numerical models for all parts of the owt see fig 1 the foundation model is an essential part of the integrated model due to its impact on the fatigue aasen et al 2017 among the different concepts for owt support structures the monopile is the preferred solution accounting for approximately 80 of the installed support structures wind europe 2018 for monopile based owts the current industry design practice is to model the foundation response by api p y curves det norske veritas 2014 american petroleum institute 2014 the api p y curve methodology has been successfully applied for pile design in the oil and gas industry for many decades arshad and o kelly 2016 however discrepancies between the response obtained with the api formulation and the actual monopile behaviour have been extensively identified in the literature lesny 2010 doherty and gavin 2011 and their applicability to predict pile behaviour in integrated analyses of owts has been questioned in addition to these shortcomings comparison between designed and measured fundamental frequencies from monopile based owts reveals that the fundamental frequencies are generally underestimated in the design zaaijer 2006 kallehave et al 2015a zaaijer 2006 and kallehave et al 2015b indicated that this is consistent with the notion that the api p y curve formulation for piles in sand tends to underestimate the soil stiffness hald et al 2009 brought into comparison measured and predicted bending moments using api p y curves for a pile in sand at the horns rev wind farm and also concluded that the soil response was underestimated by the api p y curves moreover api p y curves are generally modelled as non linear elastic and cannot reproduce the foundation damping measured in owts tarp johansen et al 2009 de vries et al 2011 shirzadeh et al 2013 damgaard et al 2013 given the limitations of the api p y curves some first steps have been taken to improve the foundation modelling byrne et al 2015 shadlou and bhattacharya 2016 hededal and klinkvort 2010 damgaard et al 2014 beuckelaers 2015 beuckelaers et al 2017 these models have either focused on improving the foundation stiffness response byrne et al 2015 shadlou and bhattacharya 2016 or the modelling of foundation damping hededal and klinkvort 2010 damgaard et al 2014 beuckelaers 2015 however there is still a lack of models that can provide simultaneously accurate foundation stiffness and damping in integrated time domain simulations of monopile based owts an alternative modelling approach that can provide both accurate foundation stiffness and damping is macro element modelling macro element models condense the response of the foundation and the surrounding soil to a force displacement relation at one point separating the foundation and the rest of the structure typically located at seabed correia 2011 the response at this point can be determined from numerical analyses of the pile and soil for instance from finite element analyses fea or from model testing modelling pile foundations with macro element models has some advantages compared to the p y curve approach first the contribution of some components of soil resistance such as side and base shear which might be relevant for monopile based owts are not included in the traditional p y methodology but are included in the macro element model second the response of the foundation is only computed in one node which means that fewer degrees of freedom are required in integrated analyses than for distributed p y curves finally in layered soils it is easier to accurately describe the overall stiffness and hysteretic damping response at seabed than accurately describing the varying p y stiffness and damping response along the length of the pile the macro element concept has been succesfully applied to describe the behaviour of shallow foundations in offshore applications such as jack up spudcan foundations houlsby and cassidy 2002 bienen et al 2006 pipelines tian and cassidy 2008 skirted foundations supporting owts skau et al 2017 or anchor block foundations for bridges installed in deep waters tistel et al 2017 the concept has also been employed to model the response of shallow cremer et al 2001 and deep foundations correia 2011 li et al 2016 in time domain simulations of earthquake events these pile macro element models can reproduce the non linear hysteretic load displacement response observed in piles however they also accumulate displacements after a few loading cycles significant accumulated displacements are not expected for the relatively low load levels and for the number of cycles present in the 10 60 min long time windows considered in integrated load simulations of owts and therefore these models are not directly applicable despite the potential to provide accurate foundation stiffness and damping the macro element approach has rarely been employed in integrated analyses of monopile based owts krathe and kaynia 2017 page et al 2017 in this paper a new macro element model for cyclic undrained loading of piles is presented the model aims at predicting the load displacement response and the hysteretic damping of piles in integrated time domain analyses of monopile based owts the model formulation is based on multi surface plasticity iwan 1967 and it represents a new application of this framework the paper is structured as follows section 2 presents the 3d fea of the pile and the surrounding soil volume used as a basis for the model formulation then section 3 describes the macro element formulation implementation and calibration after this section 4 illustrates the performance of the macro element model and compares it against fea and field tests finally section 5 lists the model limitations and section 6 outlines the conclusions 2 numerical database 2 1 introduction finite element analyses fea of the soil volume and the foundation are performed to set the basis of the macro element model the fea simulate the layered soil conditions and pile dimensions found in a real wind farm hamre et al 2010 le et al 2014 a numerical approach was selected over physical model testing because model tests are generally costly and relatively few loading paths can be considered in addition it is difficult to reproduce the layered soil conditions often found in offshore wind farms in experimental set ups especially when it involves clay cremer et al 2001 2 2 system definitions modelling the foundation behaviour in integrated analyses of offshore wind turbines involves defining the foundation response along six degrees of freedom three displacements u x u y u z and three rotations θ x θ y θ z in the foundation model described in this paper the response along the six degrees of freedom is included as follows the responses to vertical u y and torsional θ z loading are modelled elastic and uncoupled the response to lateral loading u x θ y and u y θ x is described as non linear and the coupling between the horizontal displacement at the rotation is accounted for despite the foundation model does not include all possible interactions between the six degrees of freedom it accounts for the interaction between the most important loads acting on a pile supporting a monopile based owt subjected to a main wind direction in the following sections focus is set on describing the response to planar lateral loading consequently when analysing the pile foundation system it is assumed that the pile head is subjected to a two dimensional loading system composed by a horizontal load h and an overturning moment m orthogonal to the direction of the horizontal load the loads are applied at the centre of the cross section of the pile in this manner the deformations of the pile axis the horizontal displacement u and rotation at the pile head are contained in the vertical plane defined by h fig 2 presents the notation for the pile head loads and displacements together with the sign convection suggested by butterfield et al 1997 it might also be convenient to write the loads m and h as a generalised load vector t and the displacements θ u as the work conjugate generalised displacement vector v as described by eq 1 1 t m d h v d θ u 2 3 numerical model this section describes the foundation geometry soil conditions and numerical model of the reference case used to characterise the pile foundation lateral behaviour the reference case is based on one of the monopiles at the sheringham shoal wind farm located in the north sea off the coast of norfolk the sheringham shoal wind farm accommodates 88 monopile based offshore wind turbines installed in water depths varying between 15 and 23 m the monopiles have diameters ranging from 4 7 to 5 7 m penetrating in the soil between 23 and 37 m hamre et al 2010 arany et al 2017 report pile wall thickness in the order of 0 06 m the soil conditions at sheringham shoal consist of four main soil units the bolders bank clay the egmond ground sand the swarte bank clay and the chalk rock the bolders bank formation is a firm to stiff clay with pockets of sands gravels and occasionally boulders the egmond ground formation which comprises dense to very dense sand overlies the swarte bank formation which is composed of stiff to hard sandy gravelly clay underneath several levels of chalk are present these four units extend over large areas in the southern part of the north sea le et al 2014 and therefore it is feasible to find them at other wind farms in the vicinity consequently these conditions are more representative for piles supporting owt than idealised soil profiles often used in model development more details of the geological and geotechnical characterisation of these soil units are described in le et al 2014 in the reference case a steel pile with a diameter of 5 7 m and a wall thickness of 0 06 m penetrating 28 5 m into the soil is considered three of the main soil layers the bolders bank clay the egmond ground sand and the swarte bank clay are included maximum shear modulus and undrained shear strengths from uu and cau measurements for these layers are plotted in fig 3 the pile is considered linear elastic and its behaviour is described by a young s modulus of 210 gpa while the soil units are modelled by elasto plastic models the behaviour of the clay layers in the numerical model is represented by the ngi adp soil model grimstad et al 2012 which describes the elasto plastic non linear stress path dependent behaviour of saturated clays under undrained monotonic loading conditions a shear stress strain curve interpreted from direct simple shear dss laboratory tests is compared in fig 4 with the ngi adp soil model for the bolders bank soil layer good agreement is found from small to large strain levels the available experimental data is insufficient for assessing the effect of soil anisotropy on the clay strength and stiffness and consequently the clay is modelled as an isotropic material the sand is represented in the numerical model as undrained with the hardening soil small strain model benz 2007 a model developed to describe the behaviour of sands from small strains to large strains the parameters employed to describe the soil units behaviour are listed in table 1 the contact between the soil and the pile is modelled by interface elements the stiffness of the interface is equivalent to the soil stiffness while the interface strength in compression is half of the soil strength the interface strength in extension is governed by a no tension criterion that allows gap opening between the soil and the pile the commercial software plaxis 3d brinkgreve et al 2015 is employed to perform the three dimensional fea both the problem geometry and the loading are symmetric around the vertical plane defined by h therefore it is sufficient to include half of the geometry and the loads in the numerical model fig 5 shows the mesh discretization together with the model dimensions the mesh has 230 000 10 noded tetrahedral soil elements with an average element side length of 2 m the mesh is refined around the pile where an average element side length of 0 6 m is used the pile is modelled as a solid volume with an equivalent stiffness that reproduces the bending stiffness of the hollow pile neglecting the stiffness of the soil plug pile installation effects are not considered and the pile is modelled as wished in place in initially undisturbed ground conditions boundary conditions are applied at the base of the model and at the vertical boundaries the three displacements components in the three coordinate directions are set to zero at bottom boundary on the vertical boundaries the normal component is fixed in the simulations different combinations of h and m are applied at the pile head s cross section see fig 2 in a load controlled manner following a radial path in the load plane defined by h and m 2 4 simulated pile foundation behaviour the response of the pile and surrounding soil to different load combinations is evaluated by analysing the computed displacements of the pile head at seabed fig 6 shows the computed elasto plastic horizontal displacement u and rotation d θ together with an interpolated surface to ease the visualization of results and the formulation of the model the elasto plastic response is divided into an elastic and a plastic part as expected the flat shape of the interpolated elastic response indicates that the elastic rotation d θ e and the elastic horizontal displacement u e can be expressed as a linear relation between m d and h for instance through an elastic stiffness matrix the relation between the plastic rotation d θ p and the plastic horizontal displacement u p at seabed and the loads m d and h is non linear and makes the elasto plastic surface in fig 6 curved while trying to analyse how the plastic displacements are generated as a function of the loads it might be convenient to look at how the plastic work evolves for a radial load path with loads m d h where the plastic displacements d θ p u p are generated the plastic work w p can be calculated as 2 w p 0 θ p m d θ p 0 u p h d u p the plastic work computed from the sheringham shoal reference case analyses is shown in fig 7 as contours in the m d h plane along these contours the plastic work generated is constant the shape of the contours can be approximated by an ellipse as illustrated in fig 7a in addition fig 7b plots the direction of the computed incremental plastic displacement vectors d d θ p d u p which are perpendicular to the plastic work contours this is convenient as the direction of the incremental plastic displacement vectors could be expressed as the gradient of the plastic work contours simplifying the macro element model formulation based on these findings a macro element model for piles that relates the loads m d h and the pile head displacements d θ u at seabed is proposed 3 modelling 3 1 model formulation 3 1 1 model design the macro element for piles presented in this paper follows the multi surface plasticity framework which is encompassed within classical elasto plastic theory in elasto plastic models the constitutive relation between the generalised load t and the generalised displacement increment d v is established from the following basic components 1 a principle of adding the elastic and the plastic contributions 3 d v d v e d v p where v e and v p are the generalised elastic and plastic displacement vectors 2 a relationship that governs the elastic contribution 3 ingredients controlling the plastic contribution a yield criterion b flow rule c hardening law d consistency condition the macro element model based on multi surface plasticity behaves as follows the application of a load increment leads to an elasto plastic displacement at the pile head this behaviour is illustrated in fig 8 by the non linear load displacement curve defined by points o a b and it is generated in the multi surface plasticity model by translating the yield surfaces in the m d h plane from o to a the load increment plotted in the m d h plane lays within the innermost yield surface and the displacement is only elastic from a to b the load path touches and drags the first surface and plastic displacements are generated the magnitude of the plastic displacements is function of the resistance of the yield surfaces to translate the load path eventually touches and drags the second innermost yield surface and then the plastic displacement generated to the second innermost surface is added to the plastic displacement by the innermost surface this leads to a piecewise linear load displacement response in unloading as in the path defined by b c and in reloading as in the path defined by c b d the macro element model behaves in a similar fashion first and until the innermost yield surface is reached the displacement is elastic every time a new yield surface is touched the surface is translated and plastic displacements are generated in the following sections the formulation of each of the components of the multi surface plasticity macro element model for piles is described the formulation is based on the trends computed in the fea of the soil volume and the pile foundation and supported by similar expressions from the literature 3 1 2 elastic response the elastic response of the macro element model is controlled by an elastic stiffness matrix k which relates the generalised force vector t with the generalised elastic displacement v e as follows 4 t k v e k k 11 k 12 k 21 k 22 the coefficients of k depend on the pile dimensions pile properties soil layering soil properties and drainage conditions 3 1 3 yield criterion and loading surfaces the yield criterion f is an equation formulated in terms of generalised forces t and generalised state variables α 5 f t α f m d h α m α h the representation of the yield criterion in the generalised forces space defines yield surfaces the initial yield criterion defines the limit between the elastic and the elasto plastic behaviour while the failure criterion distinguishes between the possible force states from the impossible or non allowable force states all the yield surfaces in between these two are known as loading surfaces the loading surfaces in the macro element adopt the elliptical shape of the contours of plastic work computed in section 2 4 and illustrated in fig 7a this assumption follows the work by mrôz 1967 who described the yield surfaces of a multi surface plasticity model for materials as contours of constant work hardening moduli the yield criterion f i of surface i is f i t α m d α m i sin β h α h i cos β b i 2 m d α m i cos β h α h i sin β a i 2 1 0 where α m i α h i are the generalised state variables of surface i they are also found in the literature as the coordinates of the back stress vector and they define the position of the centre of the yield surface in the load space a i and b i describe the size and β i describes the orientation of yield surface i as indicated in fig 7a the orientation β i and the ratio a i b i are approximately constant for all computed contours of plastic work in fig 7a however they might vary when the load levels increase and the soil around the pile is further mobilised the ratio a b a i b i and the orientation defined by β are assumed to be constant for all the yield surfaces in the macro element formulation this implies that the yield surfaces are homothetic to each other this yield criterion is comparable to the elliptical yield criterion proposed by li et al 2014 for a single elastic pile in sand 3 1 4 flow rule the flow rule defines the direction of the generalised plastic displacement increment d v p and it can be expressed as the gradient of a plastic potential surface g defined in the load space 6 d v p d λ g t where d λ is an scalar that determines the magnitude of d v p when g is equal to the yield surface f the flow rule is associated fig 7b plots d v p on top of a yield surface defined by contours of plastic work the d v p vectors are normal to the surfaces which indicates that an associated flow rule can be adopted in the macro element model formulation for each yield surface i d v i p is 7 d v i p d λ i f i t and d v p is computed as the sum of the plastic contributions of the active yield surfaces assuming koiter s rule koiter 1953 8 d v p i 1 j d v i p i 1 j d λ i f i t where j is the number of active or yielding surfaces that is surfaces that are translating in the load space note in this formulation if surface j is active all the surfaces enclosed by j that is from 1 to j are also active 3 1 5 hardening law the multi surface plasticity model presented here is of the pure kinematic hardening type where the yield surfaces do not change in size but only translate in the load space the kinematic hardening rule defines the direction of d α that is how do the centre of the yield surfaces translate in the macro element model the kinematic hardening rule proposed by ziegler 1959 shown in eq 9 has been adopted for each yield surface 9 d α i d μ i t α i where d μ i is function of the scalar d λ i which defines the size of d v p in the flow rule note that for each yield surface i ziegler s kinematic hardening rule is only formulated in terms of t and α i not in terms of other surfaces this can lead to intersection of the yield surfaces that is a violation of the non intersection condition that some authors prescribe in the formulation of multi surface plasticity models see for instance mrôz 1967 the main consequence of having two surfaces intersecting is that instead of having a bi linear relation a multilinear relation might be produced puzrin and houlsby 2001 puzrin and houlsby 2001 argue that this is not generally an issue and in occasions it can simplify the model implementation in addition montáns and caminero 2007 demonstrated that in multiaxial predictions using the mrôz 1967 kinematic hardening rule where the translation of the surfaces satisfies a non intersection condition 1 the multi surface plasticity model response depended on the number of yield surfaces used in the calibration and 2 mrôz s kinematic hardening rule lead to uncontrolled multiaxial ratcheting while the uniaxial response did not show ratcheting in that sense ziegler s kinematic hardening rule does not depend on the number of surfaces and does not predict multiaxial ratcheting which is more consistent with the uniaxial behaviour this translation rule can also be expressed as in grimstad et al 2014 by multiplying d v p by the plastic stiffness matrix k i p as indicated in eq 10 10 d α i k i p d v p d λ i k i p f i t note that the plastic stiffness matrix k i p is interpreted as a ratio between t α i and d v p for each yield surface i the plastic stiffness matrix k i p is constant which leads to piece wise linear hardening curves 3 1 6 consistency condition in addition to the yield criterion the flow rule and the kinematic hardening rule the consistency condition is needed to find d λ i of each yield surface in a kinematic hardening model with a single yield surface the consistency condition can be expressed as indicated in eq 11 11 d f f t t d t f α α λ d λ 0 often f α α λ is expressed as a the plastic resistance and eq 11 can be rewritten as follows 12 a d λ f t t d t f f a d λ if instead of having one active yield surface the model has j active yield surfaces the consistency condition can be expressed as 13 f f 1 f 2 f j a 11 a 1 a 12 a 1 j a 21 a 22 a 2 a 2 j a j 1 a j 2 a j j a j d λ 1 d λ 2 d λ j ξ d λ where 14 a i k f i t t k g k t and 15 a k f k t t k k p g k t the derivation of eq 13 and the coefficients a i k and a k eqs 14 and 15 are documented in detail in skau et al 2017 3 1 7 numerical implementation the macro element model has been implemented in the owt simulation software 3dfloat nygaard et al 2016 via a dll dynamic link library interface in each iteration of a calculation step 3dfloat passes on displacements and rotations δ v at seabed to the foundation model which transfers back the computed forces and moments t the numerical implementation of the macro element model solves the incremental relation 16 t t 0 δ t t 0 k δ v e t 0 k δ v δ v p where t 0 is the generalised force at the begining of the step the incremental relation from eq 16 is solved following an explicit integration algorithm where f i 0 is enforced at the end of the step if the condition f i 0 is not satisfied after a certain number of iterations an automatic substepping algorithm is called a change in the coordinate system has been applied to simplify the macro element model implementation and make it more robust in this change the axes m d h in the load plane are rotated and squeezed such as the elliptical yield surfaces are displayed as circles consequently the yield criterion can be formulated as a circle with a radius defined by a load invariant which is function of the two load components this is done by employing a linear transformation matrix r 17 t r t cos β a b sin β sin β a b cos β t where t is the generalised load vector in the transformed axes system a b describes the shape of the elliptical yield surfaces and β describes its orientation as illustrated in fig 7a note that this change can only be applied when all the yield surfaces are homothetic to each other the incremental displacement δ v is transformed accordingly with the inverse of the transpose of r i e the r t 1 matrix 18 δ v r t 1 δ v where δ v is the generalised displacement increment in the transformed axes system it can be proven that the plastic work does not vary with the reference system that is whether it is calculated in the initial system of coordinates or in the transformed system of coordinates 19 δ w p t t δ v p r t t r t 1 δ v p t t r t r t 1 δ v p t t δ v p before the constitutive equation is solved δ v and the loads from the previous load step t 0 are transferred into the transformed coordinate system by employing r and r t 1 then the constitutive relation is solved in the transformed axes system and the calculated generalised forces are transformed back to the original coordinate system 3 1 8 model calibration the calibration of the foundation model requires two types of input 1 the coefficients of the elastic stiffness matrix and 2 load displacement curves from non linear analyses the elastic stiffness matrix is used to predict the elastic response and the non linear load displacement curves are employed to derive the shape and size of the yield surfaces and the hardening law this last derivation is performed internally by the macro element model for homogeneous soil profiles the elastic stiffness matrix coefficients can be obtained from semi empirical formulae see for instance randolph 1981 gazetas 1991 or shadlou and bhattacharya 2016 for layered soil profiles or for changes in soil stiffness with depth not considered in these semi empirical formulae theses coefficients can be obtained from shadlou and bhattacharya 2014 from fea by modelling the pile and the soil as linear elastic materials or from boundary element analyses see for instance kaynia and kausel 1982 the non linear load displacement curves can be obtained from static pushover fea with a soil model that represents the relevant cyclic nonlinear response reference is made to andersen 2015 kaynia and andersen 2015 and skau and jostad 2014 for more information regarding the use of fea to compute cyclic foundation response based on soil element behaviour alternatively model test data can be employed two analyses or tests see fig 9 are required to establish these curves 1 a pushover analyses where a moment is applied at the pile head at seabed from which m u m and m θ m curves are obtained and 2 a pushover analyses where a horizontal load is applied at the pile head at seabed from which h u h and h θ h curves are obtained altogether four curves are given as input in a tabulated form the macro element model is calibrated internally as follows first it computes the plastic displacements as the difference between the elasto plastic and the elastic components then it determines the coefficients a b and β from the relations between the loads and the plastic displacements after it builds the transformation matrix r following eq 17 the load plastic displacement relations are transferred to the transformed axis system where the yield surfaces are circular and the same response is obtained in any radial direction from the transformed load plastic displacement relations the radius s i and the plastic stiffness matrix k i p k i p i associated to each yield surface are calculated following the assumption that the yield surfaces are coupled in series an sketch of the series coupled system can be found for instance in grimstad et al 2014 4 performance of the macro element model 4 1 test examples the performance of the macro element model is illustrated and compared against numerical simulations and field tests for the three examples described in table 2 in each example the selected site conditions pile dimensions and loading paths are representative for piles supporting monopile based owts 4 2 example a verification against monotonic finite element analyses the aim of this example is to illustrate the performance of the macro element model and verify the response against the fea used as a basis for the model formulation the soil conditions pile dimensions and numerical model employed in example a are described in detail in section 2 3 the macro element model is calibrated from load displacement curves computed by fea in the comparison displacement controlled radial paths where the ratio between u and d θ at the pile head is kept constant are applied at the pile head the computed moments are in the range of the measured moments at seabed for one of the monopiles at sheringham shoal during idling conditions where the owt is subjected to average wind speeds in the order of 25 27 m s and significant wave heights of 2 6 2 8 m the comparison between the macro element model and the monotonic fea is presented in fig 10 good agreement is found for all the paths evaluated in particular the macro element captures well the load displacement curves and it is also capable of reproducing correctly the coupling between m d and h seen in the fea 4 3 example b verification against cyclic finite element analyses the objective of example b is to illustrate the performance of the macro element during cyclic loading and verify the response against cyclic fea the applied loads roughly correspond to maximum uls loads from an owt installed in the north sea the cyclic loads are applied in the simulations statically which means that the frequency dependency of stiffness and damping is not included in the fea thus the only damping contribution comes from the material or hysteretic damping of the constitutive soil model the frequency dependency of the foundation response has not been included in the fea because for typical soil conditions found in owts it can be neglected at low frequencies the pile modelled in example b is a steel pile with a diameter of 6 m a wall thickness of 0 06 m and an embedded length of 24 m the pile dimensions lead to a length to diameter ratio of 4 which may be expected in the next generation of monopiles supporting offshore wind turbines the soil consists of a homogeneous isotropic clay layer with strength and stiffness according to the profile illustrated in fig 11 a constitutive model for cohesive materials that is capable of reproducing unloading and reloading similar to the model proposed by grimstad et al 2014 has been employed the model is a multi surface plasticity model with kinematic hardening where the yield surfaces are defined by the von mises criterion the flow rule is associative and the kinematic hardening is based on prager s translation rule prager 1955 the model follows masing s rule masing 1926 and does not account for accumulation of strains in the soil due to cyclic loading the constitutive model behaviour is illustrated in fig 12 for the clay in example b the fe model used to calibrate the macro element model and to perform the simulations of cyclic tests in example b follows the modelling assumptions described in section 2 3 fig 13 displays the comparison between the macro element model and the cyclic fea the applied loading at the pile head includes changes in the load direction δ m δ h and load eccentricity m h the load eccentricity m h is extracted from the integrated load simulations of a monopile based owt subjected to a turbulent wind speed of 26 m s presented in aasen et al 2017 the applied maximum loads roughly correspond to the uls loads from an owt installed in the north sea the horizontal displacements and rotations predicted by the macro element model match the results from cyclic fea very well this indicates that the macro element model can reproduce accurately varying load conditions which are expected in time domain integrated load simulations fig 13 also displays the elastic component of the horizontal displacements and rotations it is worth noting that even at load levels corresponding to uls more than half of the computed horizontal displacements and rotations are elastic 4 4 example c comparison with field tests the aim of this example is to demonstrate that the macro element model calibrated by fea can reproduce the experimental response from the lateral pile field tests documented in byrne et al 2017 the test site is located at cowden on the north east coast of england and consists on glacial ductile low plasticity stiff clay byrne et al 2017 fig 14 illustrates the compression undrained shear strength and maximum shear modulus of the soil with depth derived from field and laboratory tests powell and butcher 2003 zdravković et al 2015 byrne et al 2017 together with the profile selected in the calibration by fea the fe model employed in the calibration of the macro element model is based on the following assumptions only half of the geometry and the loads are included interface elements are applied between the pile and the soil fixed boundary conditions are applied at the base and roller boundaries are applied at the lateral boundaries and the pile is modelled with solid elements with linear elastic properties the stiffness and compression strength of the interface is equivalent to that of the soil while the interface tension strength is governed by a no tension criterion that allows gap opening between the soil and the pile the soil behaviour is modelled undrained using the ngi adp constitutive model grimstad et al 2012 the constitutive model calibration displayed in fig 15 is based on isotropically consolidated triaxial undrained compression tests and modulus reduction laboratory data powell and butcher 2003 note that the ngi adp constitutive model overestimates the stiffness in fig 15 right while it underestimates the stiffness in fig 15 left in addition zdravković et al 2015 state that the in situ geophysics revealed anisotropy typical of overconsolidated clays however there is a lack of data quantifying it in order to account for the variation in stiffness and strength in the different directions it is assumed that the strength ratios of the clay at cowden are comparable to the strength ratios of drammen clay which is a clay with a similar plasticity index p i 20 and a similar overconsolidation ratio o c r 40 based on the strength ratios from drammen clay documented in andersen et al 1980 a strength ratio of s u d s s s u t x c 0 71 in direct simple shear and a strength ratio of s u t x e s u t x c 0 55 in triaxial extension are assumed in the fea used to calibrate the model in example c two tests are compared to the macro element results one with an embedded length of l 7 62 m and another with l 4 m both tests are performed on tubular steel piles with a diameter of d 0 762 m and a nominal steel thickness of 25 mm and 11 mm byrne et al 2015 respectively this leads to length to diameter ratios of l d 10 and l d 5 25 which can be representative for piles supporting owts figs 16 and 17 illustrate the comparison between the field test results and the macro element model prediction it is apparent that the macro element model can reproduce the measured load displacement response of the field tests in particular the pile soil stiffness during loading and unloading is correctly captured at low load amplitudes during unloading the response computed by the macro element model is to a small extent stiffer than the measured response 5 limitations of the macro element model there are limitations in the application of the macro element model presented in this paper mostly due to the assumptions adopted in the model formulation the coupling between horizontal load and moment is only included in planar load conditions this means that interaction between e g two horizontal loads perpendicular to each other is not taken into account in the macro element model the effect of the vertical load on the lateral response is not explicitly accounted for in the model formulation for piles supporting monopile based owts and for the load levels considered different parts of the soil volume are mobilised when a vertical load and a lateral load are applied therefore the interaction between the vertical load and the horizontal and moment loads is not expected to be significant and it has not been included in the model formulation if considered necessary the effect of the vertical load on the lateral load response can be included indirectly by calibrating the macro element at the relevant vertical load level the macro element model is formulated and verified employing results from fea which include some assumptions the main assumptions considered in the fea are 1 the response of the pile and the soil is independent of frequency and 2 the soil conditions considered are homogeneous clay profiles or layered soil profiles where clay is predominant these assumptions limit the applicability of the macro element model to similar conditions or to cases where these assumptions are acceptable the macro element model is rate independent that is it provides foundation stiffness and damping independently of the applied loading frequency and does not include the inertia of the soil the frequency dependency has not been included in the model formulation because for typical soil conditions found in offshore wind farms it can be neglected at low frequencies for the pile and soil conditions presented in section 2 the threshold frequency calculated with the formulae from shadlou and bhattacharya 2014 is approximately 1 3 hz the first natural frequency of monopile based owts typically lies between 0 25 and 0 35 hz shadlou and bhattacharya 2016 this implies that the first natural frequency is way below the threshold and therefore no noticeable frequency dependence is expected the yield surfaces are assumed to be homothetic to each other in the macro element model formulation for the load ranges presented in this paper this assumption seems to be acceptable however results from fea at higher load levels indicate that the yield surfaces may change their orientation and shape when the soil is further mobilised skau et al 2017 if this is the case a reduction in the macro element model accuracy may be expected the kinematic hardening rule assumed in the macro element formulation follows masing s rule this is a reasonable assumption when the pile is subjected to relatively low load levels and the opening of a gap between the pile and the soil is not expected however if a gap is generated a stiffer and more non linear macro element response can be expected which results in unrealistic hysteretic damping this can be solved by calibrating the macro element model to a cyclic load displacement curve as proposed by kaynia and andersen 2015 where the effect of cyclic loading in this case the effect of gap opening is taken into account 6 conclusions in this paper a macro element model for piles in cohesive soils is presented with the objective of providing a simple efficient and accurate tool for modelling the foundation response in integrated time domain simulations of monopile based owts the macro element model reproduces the response of a pile and the surrounding soil by relating the generalised force and displacement at seabed the macro element model is formulated in the multi surface plasticity framework and it represents a new application of this framework the macro element model formulation is based on results from fea of the soil and the foundation where the pile geometry and soil conditions are selected from a real offshore wind farm focus is set on reproducing the load displacement response of a pile supporting a monopile based owt where an accurate prediction of stiffness and damping is crucial to perform reliable fatigue analyses the macro element formulation is comparable to those of similar macro element models however the presented model differs from other macro element models for piles in the treatment of accumulated displacements the macro element model does not accumulate displacements as a function of the number of cycles neither in a controlled nor in an uncontrolled manner this is consistent with the premise that significant accumulated displacements are not expected for the relatively low load levels compared to the pile capacity and for the number of cycles present in the 10 60 min long time windows considered in integrated load simulations the macro element model input is simple and intuitive where non linear load displacement curves representing the pile and soil response to monotonic lateral loading are required despite these curves can be calculated using different methods it is suggested to employ 3d fea in combination with constitutive models that can accurately reproduce the soil behaviour alternatively experimental results from model tests can be used to calibrate the model note that the accuracy of the macro element is directly linked to the accuracy of the load displacement curves employed in the calibration in order to obtain accurate predictions with the macro element model the results from fea or model tests used in the calibration should reproduce the pile behaviour accurately the performance of the macro element model has been compared against field test measurements and against results from finite element analyses for three piled foundations the comparison between the macro element prediction and field tests indicates that the macro element model can reproduce the non linear load displacement response and the hysteretic behaviour observed in piled foundations with different l d ratios in addition very good agreement is found between the macro element predictions and the fea results this confirms that for the load levels considered the macro element model can reproduce the pile and surrounding soil system behaviour with the same level of accuracy as the fea but with a considerable reduction in computational effort this is important for practical applications where the response of the foundation in time domain analyses has to be computed for thousands of load cases the macro element model was developed primarily for modelling the soil and pile response in integrated time domain simulations of monopile based offshore wind turbines on this regard the macro element model is implemented in an owt load simulation code 3dfloat via a dll interface however the macro element model is not necessarily limited to this application and it may be used to predict the pile foundation response in applications where response of the piled foundation to lateral loading in the time domain analyses is relevant such as offshore structures or bridges acknowledgements the

23089,the design of owts relies on integrated load analyses tools that simulate the response of the entire owt including the rotor nacelle assembly support structure and foundation under combined aerodynamic and hydrodynamic loading despite all efforts to develop accurate integrated models these often fail to reproduce the measured natural frequencies partly due to the current foundation modelling this paper presents a new foundation model for integrated analyses of monopile based owts the model follows the macro element approach where the response of a pile and the surrounding soil is condensed to a force displacement relation at seabed the model formulation uses multi surface plasticity and it reproduces key characteristics in monopile foundation behaviour that are not accounted for in current industry practice the basic features of the model are described and its limitations are discussed the performance of the macro element model is compared against field test measurements and results from fea the comparison indicates that the macro element model can reproduce accurately the non linear load displacement response and hysteretic behaviour measured in field tests and computed in fea this confirms that the model can simulate the pile and soil behaviour with the same level of accuracy as fea but with a considerable reduction in computational effort keywords offshore wind turbine pile foundation soil structure interaction foundation damping load calculation methods macro element model 1 introduction designing offshore wind turbines is a complex task as these are dynamic systems subjected to variable cyclic loads fatigue often drives the design and therefore dynamic structural analyses are mandatory det norske veritas 2014 dynamic structural analyses are based on integrated load simulations of several design load cases vorpahl et al 2013 and they are generally performed in the time domain det norske veritas 2014 an integrated analysis of an owt refers to the analysis of an entire owt i e rotor nacelle assembly support structure and foundation under combined aerodynamic and hydrodynamic loading and requires numerical models for all parts of the owt see fig 1 the foundation model is an essential part of the integrated model due to its impact on the fatigue aasen et al 2017 among the different concepts for owt support structures the monopile is the preferred solution accounting for approximately 80 of the installed support structures wind europe 2018 for monopile based owts the current industry design practice is to model the foundation response by api p y curves det norske veritas 2014 american petroleum institute 2014 the api p y curve methodology has been successfully applied for pile design in the oil and gas industry for many decades arshad and o kelly 2016 however discrepancies between the response obtained with the api formulation and the actual monopile behaviour have been extensively identified in the literature lesny 2010 doherty and gavin 2011 and their applicability to predict pile behaviour in integrated analyses of owts has been questioned in addition to these shortcomings comparison between designed and measured fundamental frequencies from monopile based owts reveals that the fundamental frequencies are generally underestimated in the design zaaijer 2006 kallehave et al 2015a zaaijer 2006 and kallehave et al 2015b indicated that this is consistent with the notion that the api p y curve formulation for piles in sand tends to underestimate the soil stiffness hald et al 2009 brought into comparison measured and predicted bending moments using api p y curves for a pile in sand at the horns rev wind farm and also concluded that the soil response was underestimated by the api p y curves moreover api p y curves are generally modelled as non linear elastic and cannot reproduce the foundation damping measured in owts tarp johansen et al 2009 de vries et al 2011 shirzadeh et al 2013 damgaard et al 2013 given the limitations of the api p y curves some first steps have been taken to improve the foundation modelling byrne et al 2015 shadlou and bhattacharya 2016 hededal and klinkvort 2010 damgaard et al 2014 beuckelaers 2015 beuckelaers et al 2017 these models have either focused on improving the foundation stiffness response byrne et al 2015 shadlou and bhattacharya 2016 or the modelling of foundation damping hededal and klinkvort 2010 damgaard et al 2014 beuckelaers 2015 however there is still a lack of models that can provide simultaneously accurate foundation stiffness and damping in integrated time domain simulations of monopile based owts an alternative modelling approach that can provide both accurate foundation stiffness and damping is macro element modelling macro element models condense the response of the foundation and the surrounding soil to a force displacement relation at one point separating the foundation and the rest of the structure typically located at seabed correia 2011 the response at this point can be determined from numerical analyses of the pile and soil for instance from finite element analyses fea or from model testing modelling pile foundations with macro element models has some advantages compared to the p y curve approach first the contribution of some components of soil resistance such as side and base shear which might be relevant for monopile based owts are not included in the traditional p y methodology but are included in the macro element model second the response of the foundation is only computed in one node which means that fewer degrees of freedom are required in integrated analyses than for distributed p y curves finally in layered soils it is easier to accurately describe the overall stiffness and hysteretic damping response at seabed than accurately describing the varying p y stiffness and damping response along the length of the pile the macro element concept has been succesfully applied to describe the behaviour of shallow foundations in offshore applications such as jack up spudcan foundations houlsby and cassidy 2002 bienen et al 2006 pipelines tian and cassidy 2008 skirted foundations supporting owts skau et al 2017 or anchor block foundations for bridges installed in deep waters tistel et al 2017 the concept has also been employed to model the response of shallow cremer et al 2001 and deep foundations correia 2011 li et al 2016 in time domain simulations of earthquake events these pile macro element models can reproduce the non linear hysteretic load displacement response observed in piles however they also accumulate displacements after a few loading cycles significant accumulated displacements are not expected for the relatively low load levels and for the number of cycles present in the 10 60 min long time windows considered in integrated load simulations of owts and therefore these models are not directly applicable despite the potential to provide accurate foundation stiffness and damping the macro element approach has rarely been employed in integrated analyses of monopile based owts krathe and kaynia 2017 page et al 2017 in this paper a new macro element model for cyclic undrained loading of piles is presented the model aims at predicting the load displacement response and the hysteretic damping of piles in integrated time domain analyses of monopile based owts the model formulation is based on multi surface plasticity iwan 1967 and it represents a new application of this framework the paper is structured as follows section 2 presents the 3d fea of the pile and the surrounding soil volume used as a basis for the model formulation then section 3 describes the macro element formulation implementation and calibration after this section 4 illustrates the performance of the macro element model and compares it against fea and field tests finally section 5 lists the model limitations and section 6 outlines the conclusions 2 numerical database 2 1 introduction finite element analyses fea of the soil volume and the foundation are performed to set the basis of the macro element model the fea simulate the layered soil conditions and pile dimensions found in a real wind farm hamre et al 2010 le et al 2014 a numerical approach was selected over physical model testing because model tests are generally costly and relatively few loading paths can be considered in addition it is difficult to reproduce the layered soil conditions often found in offshore wind farms in experimental set ups especially when it involves clay cremer et al 2001 2 2 system definitions modelling the foundation behaviour in integrated analyses of offshore wind turbines involves defining the foundation response along six degrees of freedom three displacements u x u y u z and three rotations θ x θ y θ z in the foundation model described in this paper the response along the six degrees of freedom is included as follows the responses to vertical u y and torsional θ z loading are modelled elastic and uncoupled the response to lateral loading u x θ y and u y θ x is described as non linear and the coupling between the horizontal displacement at the rotation is accounted for despite the foundation model does not include all possible interactions between the six degrees of freedom it accounts for the interaction between the most important loads acting on a pile supporting a monopile based owt subjected to a main wind direction in the following sections focus is set on describing the response to planar lateral loading consequently when analysing the pile foundation system it is assumed that the pile head is subjected to a two dimensional loading system composed by a horizontal load h and an overturning moment m orthogonal to the direction of the horizontal load the loads are applied at the centre of the cross section of the pile in this manner the deformations of the pile axis the horizontal displacement u and rotation at the pile head are contained in the vertical plane defined by h fig 2 presents the notation for the pile head loads and displacements together with the sign convection suggested by butterfield et al 1997 it might also be convenient to write the loads m and h as a generalised load vector t and the displacements θ u as the work conjugate generalised displacement vector v as described by eq 1 1 t m d h v d θ u 2 3 numerical model this section describes the foundation geometry soil conditions and numerical model of the reference case used to characterise the pile foundation lateral behaviour the reference case is based on one of the monopiles at the sheringham shoal wind farm located in the north sea off the coast of norfolk the sheringham shoal wind farm accommodates 88 monopile based offshore wind turbines installed in water depths varying between 15 and 23 m the monopiles have diameters ranging from 4 7 to 5 7 m penetrating in the soil between 23 and 37 m hamre et al 2010 arany et al 2017 report pile wall thickness in the order of 0 06 m the soil conditions at sheringham shoal consist of four main soil units the bolders bank clay the egmond ground sand the swarte bank clay and the chalk rock the bolders bank formation is a firm to stiff clay with pockets of sands gravels and occasionally boulders the egmond ground formation which comprises dense to very dense sand overlies the swarte bank formation which is composed of stiff to hard sandy gravelly clay underneath several levels of chalk are present these four units extend over large areas in the southern part of the north sea le et al 2014 and therefore it is feasible to find them at other wind farms in the vicinity consequently these conditions are more representative for piles supporting owt than idealised soil profiles often used in model development more details of the geological and geotechnical characterisation of these soil units are described in le et al 2014 in the reference case a steel pile with a diameter of 5 7 m and a wall thickness of 0 06 m penetrating 28 5 m into the soil is considered three of the main soil layers the bolders bank clay the egmond ground sand and the swarte bank clay are included maximum shear modulus and undrained shear strengths from uu and cau measurements for these layers are plotted in fig 3 the pile is considered linear elastic and its behaviour is described by a young s modulus of 210 gpa while the soil units are modelled by elasto plastic models the behaviour of the clay layers in the numerical model is represented by the ngi adp soil model grimstad et al 2012 which describes the elasto plastic non linear stress path dependent behaviour of saturated clays under undrained monotonic loading conditions a shear stress strain curve interpreted from direct simple shear dss laboratory tests is compared in fig 4 with the ngi adp soil model for the bolders bank soil layer good agreement is found from small to large strain levels the available experimental data is insufficient for assessing the effect of soil anisotropy on the clay strength and stiffness and consequently the clay is modelled as an isotropic material the sand is represented in the numerical model as undrained with the hardening soil small strain model benz 2007 a model developed to describe the behaviour of sands from small strains to large strains the parameters employed to describe the soil units behaviour are listed in table 1 the contact between the soil and the pile is modelled by interface elements the stiffness of the interface is equivalent to the soil stiffness while the interface strength in compression is half of the soil strength the interface strength in extension is governed by a no tension criterion that allows gap opening between the soil and the pile the commercial software plaxis 3d brinkgreve et al 2015 is employed to perform the three dimensional fea both the problem geometry and the loading are symmetric around the vertical plane defined by h therefore it is sufficient to include half of the geometry and the loads in the numerical model fig 5 shows the mesh discretization together with the model dimensions the mesh has 230 000 10 noded tetrahedral soil elements with an average element side length of 2 m the mesh is refined around the pile where an average element side length of 0 6 m is used the pile is modelled as a solid volume with an equivalent stiffness that reproduces the bending stiffness of the hollow pile neglecting the stiffness of the soil plug pile installation effects are not considered and the pile is modelled as wished in place in initially undisturbed ground conditions boundary conditions are applied at the base of the model and at the vertical boundaries the three displacements components in the three coordinate directions are set to zero at bottom boundary on the vertical boundaries the normal component is fixed in the simulations different combinations of h and m are applied at the pile head s cross section see fig 2 in a load controlled manner following a radial path in the load plane defined by h and m 2 4 simulated pile foundation behaviour the response of the pile and surrounding soil to different load combinations is evaluated by analysing the computed displacements of the pile head at seabed fig 6 shows the computed elasto plastic horizontal displacement u and rotation d θ together with an interpolated surface to ease the visualization of results and the formulation of the model the elasto plastic response is divided into an elastic and a plastic part as expected the flat shape of the interpolated elastic response indicates that the elastic rotation d θ e and the elastic horizontal displacement u e can be expressed as a linear relation between m d and h for instance through an elastic stiffness matrix the relation between the plastic rotation d θ p and the plastic horizontal displacement u p at seabed and the loads m d and h is non linear and makes the elasto plastic surface in fig 6 curved while trying to analyse how the plastic displacements are generated as a function of the loads it might be convenient to look at how the plastic work evolves for a radial load path with loads m d h where the plastic displacements d θ p u p are generated the plastic work w p can be calculated as 2 w p 0 θ p m d θ p 0 u p h d u p the plastic work computed from the sheringham shoal reference case analyses is shown in fig 7 as contours in the m d h plane along these contours the plastic work generated is constant the shape of the contours can be approximated by an ellipse as illustrated in fig 7a in addition fig 7b plots the direction of the computed incremental plastic displacement vectors d d θ p d u p which are perpendicular to the plastic work contours this is convenient as the direction of the incremental plastic displacement vectors could be expressed as the gradient of the plastic work contours simplifying the macro element model formulation based on these findings a macro element model for piles that relates the loads m d h and the pile head displacements d θ u at seabed is proposed 3 modelling 3 1 model formulation 3 1 1 model design the macro element for piles presented in this paper follows the multi surface plasticity framework which is encompassed within classical elasto plastic theory in elasto plastic models the constitutive relation between the generalised load t and the generalised displacement increment d v is established from the following basic components 1 a principle of adding the elastic and the plastic contributions 3 d v d v e d v p where v e and v p are the generalised elastic and plastic displacement vectors 2 a relationship that governs the elastic contribution 3 ingredients controlling the plastic contribution a yield criterion b flow rule c hardening law d consistency condition the macro element model based on multi surface plasticity behaves as follows the application of a load increment leads to an elasto plastic displacement at the pile head this behaviour is illustrated in fig 8 by the non linear load displacement curve defined by points o a b and it is generated in the multi surface plasticity model by translating the yield surfaces in the m d h plane from o to a the load increment plotted in the m d h plane lays within the innermost yield surface and the displacement is only elastic from a to b the load path touches and drags the first surface and plastic displacements are generated the magnitude of the plastic displacements is function of the resistance of the yield surfaces to translate the load path eventually touches and drags the second innermost yield surface and then the plastic displacement generated to the second innermost surface is added to the plastic displacement by the innermost surface this leads to a piecewise linear load displacement response in unloading as in the path defined by b c and in reloading as in the path defined by c b d the macro element model behaves in a similar fashion first and until the innermost yield surface is reached the displacement is elastic every time a new yield surface is touched the surface is translated and plastic displacements are generated in the following sections the formulation of each of the components of the multi surface plasticity macro element model for piles is described the formulation is based on the trends computed in the fea of the soil volume and the pile foundation and supported by similar expressions from the literature 3 1 2 elastic response the elastic response of the macro element model is controlled by an elastic stiffness matrix k which relates the generalised force vector t with the generalised elastic displacement v e as follows 4 t k v e k k 11 k 12 k 21 k 22 the coefficients of k depend on the pile dimensions pile properties soil layering soil properties and drainage conditions 3 1 3 yield criterion and loading surfaces the yield criterion f is an equation formulated in terms of generalised forces t and generalised state variables α 5 f t α f m d h α m α h the representation of the yield criterion in the generalised forces space defines yield surfaces the initial yield criterion defines the limit between the elastic and the elasto plastic behaviour while the failure criterion distinguishes between the possible force states from the impossible or non allowable force states all the yield surfaces in between these two are known as loading surfaces the loading surfaces in the macro element adopt the elliptical shape of the contours of plastic work computed in section 2 4 and illustrated in fig 7a this assumption follows the work by mrôz 1967 who described the yield surfaces of a multi surface plasticity model for materials as contours of constant work hardening moduli the yield criterion f i of surface i is f i t α m d α m i sin β h α h i cos β b i 2 m d α m i cos β h α h i sin β a i 2 1 0 where α m i α h i are the generalised state variables of surface i they are also found in the literature as the coordinates of the back stress vector and they define the position of the centre of the yield surface in the load space a i and b i describe the size and β i describes the orientation of yield surface i as indicated in fig 7a the orientation β i and the ratio a i b i are approximately constant for all computed contours of plastic work in fig 7a however they might vary when the load levels increase and the soil around the pile is further mobilised the ratio a b a i b i and the orientation defined by β are assumed to be constant for all the yield surfaces in the macro element formulation this implies that the yield surfaces are homothetic to each other this yield criterion is comparable to the elliptical yield criterion proposed by li et al 2014 for a single elastic pile in sand 3 1 4 flow rule the flow rule defines the direction of the generalised plastic displacement increment d v p and it can be expressed as the gradient of a plastic potential surface g defined in the load space 6 d v p d λ g t where d λ is an scalar that determines the magnitude of d v p when g is equal to the yield surface f the flow rule is associated fig 7b plots d v p on top of a yield surface defined by contours of plastic work the d v p vectors are normal to the surfaces which indicates that an associated flow rule can be adopted in the macro element model formulation for each yield surface i d v i p is 7 d v i p d λ i f i t and d v p is computed as the sum of the plastic contributions of the active yield surfaces assuming koiter s rule koiter 1953 8 d v p i 1 j d v i p i 1 j d λ i f i t where j is the number of active or yielding surfaces that is surfaces that are translating in the load space note in this formulation if surface j is active all the surfaces enclosed by j that is from 1 to j are also active 3 1 5 hardening law the multi surface plasticity model presented here is of the pure kinematic hardening type where the yield surfaces do not change in size but only translate in the load space the kinematic hardening rule defines the direction of d α that is how do the centre of the yield surfaces translate in the macro element model the kinematic hardening rule proposed by ziegler 1959 shown in eq 9 has been adopted for each yield surface 9 d α i d μ i t α i where d μ i is function of the scalar d λ i which defines the size of d v p in the flow rule note that for each yield surface i ziegler s kinematic hardening rule is only formulated in terms of t and α i not in terms of other surfaces this can lead to intersection of the yield surfaces that is a violation of the non intersection condition that some authors prescribe in the formulation of multi surface plasticity models see for instance mrôz 1967 the main consequence of having two surfaces intersecting is that instead of having a bi linear relation a multilinear relation might be produced puzrin and houlsby 2001 puzrin and houlsby 2001 argue that this is not generally an issue and in occasions it can simplify the model implementation in addition montáns and caminero 2007 demonstrated that in multiaxial predictions using the mrôz 1967 kinematic hardening rule where the translation of the surfaces satisfies a non intersection condition 1 the multi surface plasticity model response depended on the number of yield surfaces used in the calibration and 2 mrôz s kinematic hardening rule lead to uncontrolled multiaxial ratcheting while the uniaxial response did not show ratcheting in that sense ziegler s kinematic hardening rule does not depend on the number of surfaces and does not predict multiaxial ratcheting which is more consistent with the uniaxial behaviour this translation rule can also be expressed as in grimstad et al 2014 by multiplying d v p by the plastic stiffness matrix k i p as indicated in eq 10 10 d α i k i p d v p d λ i k i p f i t note that the plastic stiffness matrix k i p is interpreted as a ratio between t α i and d v p for each yield surface i the plastic stiffness matrix k i p is constant which leads to piece wise linear hardening curves 3 1 6 consistency condition in addition to the yield criterion the flow rule and the kinematic hardening rule the consistency condition is needed to find d λ i of each yield surface in a kinematic hardening model with a single yield surface the consistency condition can be expressed as indicated in eq 11 11 d f f t t d t f α α λ d λ 0 often f α α λ is expressed as a the plastic resistance and eq 11 can be rewritten as follows 12 a d λ f t t d t f f a d λ if instead of having one active yield surface the model has j active yield surfaces the consistency condition can be expressed as 13 f f 1 f 2 f j a 11 a 1 a 12 a 1 j a 21 a 22 a 2 a 2 j a j 1 a j 2 a j j a j d λ 1 d λ 2 d λ j ξ d λ where 14 a i k f i t t k g k t and 15 a k f k t t k k p g k t the derivation of eq 13 and the coefficients a i k and a k eqs 14 and 15 are documented in detail in skau et al 2017 3 1 7 numerical implementation the macro element model has been implemented in the owt simulation software 3dfloat nygaard et al 2016 via a dll dynamic link library interface in each iteration of a calculation step 3dfloat passes on displacements and rotations δ v at seabed to the foundation model which transfers back the computed forces and moments t the numerical implementation of the macro element model solves the incremental relation 16 t t 0 δ t t 0 k δ v e t 0 k δ v δ v p where t 0 is the generalised force at the begining of the step the incremental relation from eq 16 is solved following an explicit integration algorithm where f i 0 is enforced at the end of the step if the condition f i 0 is not satisfied after a certain number of iterations an automatic substepping algorithm is called a change in the coordinate system has been applied to simplify the macro element model implementation and make it more robust in this change the axes m d h in the load plane are rotated and squeezed such as the elliptical yield surfaces are displayed as circles consequently the yield criterion can be formulated as a circle with a radius defined by a load invariant which is function of the two load components this is done by employing a linear transformation matrix r 17 t r t cos β a b sin β sin β a b cos β t where t is the generalised load vector in the transformed axes system a b describes the shape of the elliptical yield surfaces and β describes its orientation as illustrated in fig 7a note that this change can only be applied when all the yield surfaces are homothetic to each other the incremental displacement δ v is transformed accordingly with the inverse of the transpose of r i e the r t 1 matrix 18 δ v r t 1 δ v where δ v is the generalised displacement increment in the transformed axes system it can be proven that the plastic work does not vary with the reference system that is whether it is calculated in the initial system of coordinates or in the transformed system of coordinates 19 δ w p t t δ v p r t t r t 1 δ v p t t r t r t 1 δ v p t t δ v p before the constitutive equation is solved δ v and the loads from the previous load step t 0 are transferred into the transformed coordinate system by employing r and r t 1 then the constitutive relation is solved in the transformed axes system and the calculated generalised forces are transformed back to the original coordinate system 3 1 8 model calibration the calibration of the foundation model requires two types of input 1 the coefficients of the elastic stiffness matrix and 2 load displacement curves from non linear analyses the elastic stiffness matrix is used to predict the elastic response and the non linear load displacement curves are employed to derive the shape and size of the yield surfaces and the hardening law this last derivation is performed internally by the macro element model for homogeneous soil profiles the elastic stiffness matrix coefficients can be obtained from semi empirical formulae see for instance randolph 1981 gazetas 1991 or shadlou and bhattacharya 2016 for layered soil profiles or for changes in soil stiffness with depth not considered in these semi empirical formulae theses coefficients can be obtained from shadlou and bhattacharya 2014 from fea by modelling the pile and the soil as linear elastic materials or from boundary element analyses see for instance kaynia and kausel 1982 the non linear load displacement curves can be obtained from static pushover fea with a soil model that represents the relevant cyclic nonlinear response reference is made to andersen 2015 kaynia and andersen 2015 and skau and jostad 2014 for more information regarding the use of fea to compute cyclic foundation response based on soil element behaviour alternatively model test data can be employed two analyses or tests see fig 9 are required to establish these curves 1 a pushover analyses where a moment is applied at the pile head at seabed from which m u m and m θ m curves are obtained and 2 a pushover analyses where a horizontal load is applied at the pile head at seabed from which h u h and h θ h curves are obtained altogether four curves are given as input in a tabulated form the macro element model is calibrated internally as follows first it computes the plastic displacements as the difference between the elasto plastic and the elastic components then it determines the coefficients a b and β from the relations between the loads and the plastic displacements after it builds the transformation matrix r following eq 17 the load plastic displacement relations are transferred to the transformed axis system where the yield surfaces are circular and the same response is obtained in any radial direction from the transformed load plastic displacement relations the radius s i and the plastic stiffness matrix k i p k i p i associated to each yield surface are calculated following the assumption that the yield surfaces are coupled in series an sketch of the series coupled system can be found for instance in grimstad et al 2014 4 performance of the macro element model 4 1 test examples the performance of the macro element model is illustrated and compared against numerical simulations and field tests for the three examples described in table 2 in each example the selected site conditions pile dimensions and loading paths are representative for piles supporting monopile based owts 4 2 example a verification against monotonic finite element analyses the aim of this example is to illustrate the performance of the macro element model and verify the response against the fea used as a basis for the model formulation the soil conditions pile dimensions and numerical model employed in example a are described in detail in section 2 3 the macro element model is calibrated from load displacement curves computed by fea in the comparison displacement controlled radial paths where the ratio between u and d θ at the pile head is kept constant are applied at the pile head the computed moments are in the range of the measured moments at seabed for one of the monopiles at sheringham shoal during idling conditions where the owt is subjected to average wind speeds in the order of 25 27 m s and significant wave heights of 2 6 2 8 m the comparison between the macro element model and the monotonic fea is presented in fig 10 good agreement is found for all the paths evaluated in particular the macro element captures well the load displacement curves and it is also capable of reproducing correctly the coupling between m d and h seen in the fea 4 3 example b verification against cyclic finite element analyses the objective of example b is to illustrate the performance of the macro element during cyclic loading and verify the response against cyclic fea the applied loads roughly correspond to maximum uls loads from an owt installed in the north sea the cyclic loads are applied in the simulations statically which means that the frequency dependency of stiffness and damping is not included in the fea thus the only damping contribution comes from the material or hysteretic damping of the constitutive soil model the frequency dependency of the foundation response has not been included in the fea because for typical soil conditions found in owts it can be neglected at low frequencies the pile modelled in example b is a steel pile with a diameter of 6 m a wall thickness of 0 06 m and an embedded length of 24 m the pile dimensions lead to a length to diameter ratio of 4 which may be expected in the next generation of monopiles supporting offshore wind turbines the soil consists of a homogeneous isotropic clay layer with strength and stiffness according to the profile illustrated in fig 11 a constitutive model for cohesive materials that is capable of reproducing unloading and reloading similar to the model proposed by grimstad et al 2014 has been employed the model is a multi surface plasticity model with kinematic hardening where the yield surfaces are defined by the von mises criterion the flow rule is associative and the kinematic hardening is based on prager s translation rule prager 1955 the model follows masing s rule masing 1926 and does not account for accumulation of strains in the soil due to cyclic loading the constitutive model behaviour is illustrated in fig 12 for the clay in example b the fe model used to calibrate the macro element model and to perform the simulations of cyclic tests in example b follows the modelling assumptions described in section 2 3 fig 13 displays the comparison between the macro element model and the cyclic fea the applied loading at the pile head includes changes in the load direction δ m δ h and load eccentricity m h the load eccentricity m h is extracted from the integrated load simulations of a monopile based owt subjected to a turbulent wind speed of 26 m s presented in aasen et al 2017 the applied maximum loads roughly correspond to the uls loads from an owt installed in the north sea the horizontal displacements and rotations predicted by the macro element model match the results from cyclic fea very well this indicates that the macro element model can reproduce accurately varying load conditions which are expected in time domain integrated load simulations fig 13 also displays the elastic component of the horizontal displacements and rotations it is worth noting that even at load levels corresponding to uls more than half of the computed horizontal displacements and rotations are elastic 4 4 example c comparison with field tests the aim of this example is to demonstrate that the macro element model calibrated by fea can reproduce the experimental response from the lateral pile field tests documented in byrne et al 2017 the test site is located at cowden on the north east coast of england and consists on glacial ductile low plasticity stiff clay byrne et al 2017 fig 14 illustrates the compression undrained shear strength and maximum shear modulus of the soil with depth derived from field and laboratory tests powell and butcher 2003 zdravković et al 2015 byrne et al 2017 together with the profile selected in the calibration by fea the fe model employed in the calibration of the macro element model is based on the following assumptions only half of the geometry and the loads are included interface elements are applied between the pile and the soil fixed boundary conditions are applied at the base and roller boundaries are applied at the lateral boundaries and the pile is modelled with solid elements with linear elastic properties the stiffness and compression strength of the interface is equivalent to that of the soil while the interface tension strength is governed by a no tension criterion that allows gap opening between the soil and the pile the soil behaviour is modelled undrained using the ngi adp constitutive model grimstad et al 2012 the constitutive model calibration displayed in fig 15 is based on isotropically consolidated triaxial undrained compression tests and modulus reduction laboratory data powell and butcher 2003 note that the ngi adp constitutive model overestimates the stiffness in fig 15 right while it underestimates the stiffness in fig 15 left in addition zdravković et al 2015 state that the in situ geophysics revealed anisotropy typical of overconsolidated clays however there is a lack of data quantifying it in order to account for the variation in stiffness and strength in the different directions it is assumed that the strength ratios of the clay at cowden are comparable to the strength ratios of drammen clay which is a clay with a similar plasticity index p i 20 and a similar overconsolidation ratio o c r 40 based on the strength ratios from drammen clay documented in andersen et al 1980 a strength ratio of s u d s s s u t x c 0 71 in direct simple shear and a strength ratio of s u t x e s u t x c 0 55 in triaxial extension are assumed in the fea used to calibrate the model in example c two tests are compared to the macro element results one with an embedded length of l 7 62 m and another with l 4 m both tests are performed on tubular steel piles with a diameter of d 0 762 m and a nominal steel thickness of 25 mm and 11 mm byrne et al 2015 respectively this leads to length to diameter ratios of l d 10 and l d 5 25 which can be representative for piles supporting owts figs 16 and 17 illustrate the comparison between the field test results and the macro element model prediction it is apparent that the macro element model can reproduce the measured load displacement response of the field tests in particular the pile soil stiffness during loading and unloading is correctly captured at low load amplitudes during unloading the response computed by the macro element model is to a small extent stiffer than the measured response 5 limitations of the macro element model there are limitations in the application of the macro element model presented in this paper mostly due to the assumptions adopted in the model formulation the coupling between horizontal load and moment is only included in planar load conditions this means that interaction between e g two horizontal loads perpendicular to each other is not taken into account in the macro element model the effect of the vertical load on the lateral response is not explicitly accounted for in the model formulation for piles supporting monopile based owts and for the load levels considered different parts of the soil volume are mobilised when a vertical load and a lateral load are applied therefore the interaction between the vertical load and the horizontal and moment loads is not expected to be significant and it has not been included in the model formulation if considered necessary the effect of the vertical load on the lateral load response can be included indirectly by calibrating the macro element at the relevant vertical load level the macro element model is formulated and verified employing results from fea which include some assumptions the main assumptions considered in the fea are 1 the response of the pile and the soil is independent of frequency and 2 the soil conditions considered are homogeneous clay profiles or layered soil profiles where clay is predominant these assumptions limit the applicability of the macro element model to similar conditions or to cases where these assumptions are acceptable the macro element model is rate independent that is it provides foundation stiffness and damping independently of the applied loading frequency and does not include the inertia of the soil the frequency dependency has not been included in the model formulation because for typical soil conditions found in offshore wind farms it can be neglected at low frequencies for the pile and soil conditions presented in section 2 the threshold frequency calculated with the formulae from shadlou and bhattacharya 2014 is approximately 1 3 hz the first natural frequency of monopile based owts typically lies between 0 25 and 0 35 hz shadlou and bhattacharya 2016 this implies that the first natural frequency is way below the threshold and therefore no noticeable frequency dependence is expected the yield surfaces are assumed to be homothetic to each other in the macro element model formulation for the load ranges presented in this paper this assumption seems to be acceptable however results from fea at higher load levels indicate that the yield surfaces may change their orientation and shape when the soil is further mobilised skau et al 2017 if this is the case a reduction in the macro element model accuracy may be expected the kinematic hardening rule assumed in the macro element formulation follows masing s rule this is a reasonable assumption when the pile is subjected to relatively low load levels and the opening of a gap between the pile and the soil is not expected however if a gap is generated a stiffer and more non linear macro element response can be expected which results in unrealistic hysteretic damping this can be solved by calibrating the macro element model to a cyclic load displacement curve as proposed by kaynia and andersen 2015 where the effect of cyclic loading in this case the effect of gap opening is taken into account 6 conclusions in this paper a macro element model for piles in cohesive soils is presented with the objective of providing a simple efficient and accurate tool for modelling the foundation response in integrated time domain simulations of monopile based owts the macro element model reproduces the response of a pile and the surrounding soil by relating the generalised force and displacement at seabed the macro element model is formulated in the multi surface plasticity framework and it represents a new application of this framework the macro element model formulation is based on results from fea of the soil and the foundation where the pile geometry and soil conditions are selected from a real offshore wind farm focus is set on reproducing the load displacement response of a pile supporting a monopile based owt where an accurate prediction of stiffness and damping is crucial to perform reliable fatigue analyses the macro element formulation is comparable to those of similar macro element models however the presented model differs from other macro element models for piles in the treatment of accumulated displacements the macro element model does not accumulate displacements as a function of the number of cycles neither in a controlled nor in an uncontrolled manner this is consistent with the premise that significant accumulated displacements are not expected for the relatively low load levels compared to the pile capacity and for the number of cycles present in the 10 60 min long time windows considered in integrated load simulations the macro element model input is simple and intuitive where non linear load displacement curves representing the pile and soil response to monotonic lateral loading are required despite these curves can be calculated using different methods it is suggested to employ 3d fea in combination with constitutive models that can accurately reproduce the soil behaviour alternatively experimental results from model tests can be used to calibrate the model note that the accuracy of the macro element is directly linked to the accuracy of the load displacement curves employed in the calibration in order to obtain accurate predictions with the macro element model the results from fea or model tests used in the calibration should reproduce the pile behaviour accurately the performance of the macro element model has been compared against field test measurements and against results from finite element analyses for three piled foundations the comparison between the macro element prediction and field tests indicates that the macro element model can reproduce the non linear load displacement response and the hysteretic behaviour observed in piled foundations with different l d ratios in addition very good agreement is found between the macro element predictions and the fea results this confirms that for the load levels considered the macro element model can reproduce the pile and surrounding soil system behaviour with the same level of accuracy as the fea but with a considerable reduction in computational effort this is important for practical applications where the response of the foundation in time domain analyses has to be computed for thousands of load cases the macro element model was developed primarily for modelling the soil and pile response in integrated time domain simulations of monopile based offshore wind turbines on this regard the macro element model is implemented in an owt load simulation code 3dfloat via a dll interface however the macro element model is not necessarily limited to this application and it may be used to predict the pile foundation response in applications where response of the piled foundation to lateral loading in the time domain analyses is relevant such as offshore structures or bridges acknowledgements the
