15275,electrochemically producing hydrogen peroxide h2o2 from oxygen reduction reaction orr with natural air diffusion electrode nade is an attractive way to supply h2o2 for decentralized water treatment in this study the stability of nade during h2o2 electroproduction in varying water matrices were evaluated including synthetic electrolyte solutions 0 05 m na2so4 with or without calcium ions ca2 200 mg l and or humic acid ha 40 mg l as well as a selected municipal wastewater 92 7 mg l ca2 3 6 mg l mg2 and 23 9 mg l total organic carbon the results show that nades maintained a good stability during h2o2 electroproduction in na2so4 solutions regardless of the presence of ha however ca2 and mg2 could form significant amounts of mineral precipitates on the surface and in the internal pores of nades during h2o2 electroproduction these mineral precipitates can negatively influence h2o2 production by impeding the oxygen electron and proton transfer processes involved in orr to h2o2 moreover the mineral precipitates shifted the nades from hydrophobic to hydrophilic which may promote h2o2 reduction to h2o at the nades consequently the apparent current efficiencies of h2o2 production decreased substantially from initially 90 to 50 70 as the nades were continuously used for 60 h in the ca containing solutions and selected wastewater these results indicate that water constituents that are commonly present in real water matrices especially ca2 can cause serious deterioration of nade stability during h2o2 electroproduction therefore proper strategies are needed to mitigate electrode fouling during h2o2 electroproduction with nades in practical water and wastewater treatment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords calcium electrode fouling gas diffusion electrode oxygen reduction water treatment data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction hydrogen peroxide h2o2 is commonly used in a variety of advanced oxidation processes aops for water and wastewater treatment such as the fenton fe2 h2o2 ultraviolet uv h2o2 and peroxone o3 h2o2 processes miklos et al 2018 o s santos et al 2022 von gunten 2018 however the risks associated with the transport and storage of h2o2 stocks e g explosion and corrosion have limited its practical applications especially in decentralized water treatment systems where frequent replenishment of chemical reagents is undesired von gunten 2018 yang et al 2018 zhou et al 2019 to avoid the risks of h2o2 stocks and support low maintenance water treatment electrochemical production of h2o2 from two electron oxygen reduction reaction orr eq 1 has been proposed as an attractive alternative to produce h2o2 on site and on demand for decentralized applications barazesh et al 2015 brillas et al 2009 li et al 2013 o s santos et al 2022 1 2 h o 2 2 e h 2 o 2 a number of studies have shown that h2o2 can be electrochemically produced in various water matrices e g natural water and

electrochemical h2o2 production several electrochemically driven aops eaops such as the electro fenton electro peroxone and e uv h2o2 processes have been developed barazesh et al 2015 brillas et al 1996 frangos et al 2016 oturan et al 2000 yuan et al 2013 these eaops can generally achieve similar or even better water treatment performance compared to the conventional h2o2 based aops thus offering a more flexible and safer alternative for decentralized water treatment brillas et al 2009 salmerón et al 2018 von gunten 2018 wang et al 2018 natural air diffusion electrode nade is a promising type of gas diffusion electrode gde for electro generating h2o2 from orr for decentralized water treatment li et al 2021a zhang et al 2020 the nade has a superhydrophobic gas diffusion layer that allows oxygen in the atmosphere to diffuse actively to orr sites on the catalyst layer for h2o2 electroproduction thus by directly utilizing oxygen in the air the nade can avoid the need of external gas pumps required for conventional gdes zhang et al 2020 this considerably facilitates the construction of compact and low maintenance electrochemical reactors for decentralized applications stably producing h2o2 over long term operation and varying conditions is crucial for the low maintenance water treatment in decentralized systems li et al 2021b perry et al 2021 yang et al 2018 zhou et al 2019 however to date only a few studies have evaluated the stability of gdes for h2o2 production in real water matrices e g natural water and wastewater barazesh et al 2015 li et al 2021b in contrast most studies evaluated the stability of gdes only in synthetic solutions prepared with pure water and supporting electrolytes e g sodium sulfate na2so4 an et al 2022 an et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 zhao et al 2019 although it has often been reported that gdes can maintain a good stability in synthetic solutions these results may not be applied to real water matrix for example a recent study showed that the current efficiencies of h2o2 production decreased gradually from 95 to 70 during a 46 d trial of electroproduction of h2o2 in a selected groundwater li et al 2021b simultaneous with the deterioration of h2o2 production increasing amounts of precipitations were observed on the gde surface li et al 2021b therefore it has been hypothesized that the deterioration of the gde performance may be partly attributed to the electrode fouling by inorganic and or organic constituents in the groundwater e g calcium ions ca2 and dissolved organic matter dom li et al 2021b salmerón et al 2021 the main objective of this study was to examine the effects of water constituents that are commonly present in real water matrices on the stability of nade for h2o2 electroproduction home made nades were tested in multi cycle experiments of h2o2 electroproduction in synthetic electrolyte solutions 0 05 m na2so4 in the absence and presence of ca2 and or humic acid ha as well in a selected municipal wastewater apparent current efficiencies aces of h2o2 electroproduction during the multi cycle tests were determined to evaluate the stability of the nades the evolution of physiochemical and electrochemical properties of the nades during the tests were characterized with various techniques to reveal the effects of water constituents on nade stability based on the obtained findings strategies to mitigate electrode fouling in practical water and wastewater treatment are discussed 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and water samples calcium chloride cacl2

grade was purchased from sinopharm co ltd china all solutions were prepared with deionized di water produced by master touch q hetai co ltd china to evaluate the effect of ca2 and organic water constituents on nade stability during h2o2 electroproduction synthetic solutions with 200 mg l ca2 and or 18 4 mg l ha measured as dissolved organic carbon doc were prepared the selected ca2 and doc concentrations are within the concentration range of ca2 and doc of source waters commonly encountered in decentralized water and wastewater treatment e g municipal wastewater groundwater and storm water battilani et al 2010 leong et al 2017 van voorthuizen et al 2005 in addition to simulate h2o2 electroproduction under typical ph in water and wastewater treatment circumneutral to weakly basic ph the synthetic solutions were buffered with borate at ph 8 during the experiments a municipal wastewater sample was collected at the inlet of the wastewater treatment plant on tsinghua university campus and tested as a potential water source for water reuse in decentralized applications barazesh et al 2015 yang et al 2018 after collection the selected wastewater was filtered through a polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe fiber filter with a mesh number of 400 to remove suspended solids the main water quality parameters of the selected wastewater are summarized in table 1 2 2 electrode preparation the carbon ptfe electrode was prepared with vulcan xc 72 carbon powder cabot co ltd u s a ptfe dispersion 60 wt hesen co ltd china and anhydrous alcohol sinopharm co ltd china following a previously described protocol wang et al 2012 in brief a mixture of 3 g carbon black powder 4 ml ptfe dispersion and 40 ml of anhydrous alcohol was mixed in an ultrasonic bath for 15 min next the mixture was agitated continually with a glass rod on an electric furnace at 150 c to evaporate any alcohol the resulting xc 72 carbon ptfe cake was then compressed in a roller press to form a sheet with a thickness of about 1 mm two pieces of the carbon ptfe sheet and a piece of nickel mesh were sandwiched and then pressed together at a pressure of 20 mpa for 1 min to form the electrode finally the electrode was sintered in a muffle furnace at 350 c for 1 h in air 2 3 electrochemical h2o2 production multi cycle experiments of electrochemical h2o2 production was conducted in a polymethyl methacarylate reactor with an effective volume of 0 3 l 7 6 9 cm see fig 1 a pt sheet and a carbon ptfe nade with a projected area of 3 cm 3 cm were employed as the anode and cathode respectively the pt anode was used in this study because the high stability of pt can avoid the change of anode properties from influencing the experimental results e g h2o2 production during the multi cycle experiments to evaluate the effects of inorganic and organic constituents on the stability of nade multi cycle experiments of electrochemical h2o2 production were performed with synthetic electrolyte solutions 0 05 m na2so4 in di water in the absence and presence of 200 mg l ca2 and or 18 4 mg l ha as well as with the selected municipal wastewater during the multi cycle experiments the nades were continuously used whereas the solutions were replaced with freshly prepared solutions every 2 h however for the experiments with na2so4 ha solutions and the selected wastewater the solutions were replaced every 12 h due to the relatively high cost of ha sample and the limited volume of collected wastewater sample during each cycle of experiments h2o2 concentrations were measured at 15 min with a spectrophotometer at 402 nm dr 5000 hitachi co ltd japan using the potassium titanium iv oxalate method sellers 1980 the apparent current efficiency ace of h2o2 electroproduction was calculated

in the ca2 containing solutions na2so4 ca na2so4 ca ha and selected wastewater the nades were immersed in 0 01 m citric acid for 12 h to remove mineral precipitates on the electrode mameda et al 2017 warsinger et al 2015 during the acid wash the solution was gently stirred with a magnetic stirrer at 300 rpm the acid washed nades were then flushed with di water for several times to remove any residual acid and naturally dried before they were used again for electrochemical h2o2 production for simplicity the gdes that had been used for x hours of electrochemical h2o2 production in na2so4 na2so4 with ca2 na2so4 with ha na2so4 with ca2 and ha solutions and the selected municipal wastewater are denoted as na2so4 x ca x ha x ca ha x and ww x hereafter respectively the nades that were acid washed are indicated by the suffix aw in the name for example ca 60 aw and ca ha 60 aw 2 4 electrode characterizations the morphologies of virgin and used nades were examined by a zeiss merlin scanning electron microscopy energy disperse spectroscopy sem eds zeiss co ltd germany the contact angle ca of the electrode surface was measured by an oca 25 optical contact angle measuring device dataphysics co ltd germant with a drop size of 3 μl the surface functional group information was obtained via a nicolet 870 attenuated total reflection infrared spectrum atr ir device thermo scientific co ltd u s a the crystal structure of mineral scale was examined by d8 advance x ray diffraction xrd device bruker co ltd germany the pore volume structure of the virgin and used nades was analyzed by n2 adsorption with an autosorb iq3 device quantachrome co ltd u s a the isotherms were then analyzed using the density functional theory to determine pore size distribution note that before the n2 adsorption analysis the mineral scale on the nade surface had been removed by scratching cyclic voltammetry cv was performed with 0 01 m k3 fe cn 6 probe in 1 m kcl solution at a scan rate of 0 05 v s by using a chi 760e electrochemical workstation chenhua co ltd china electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis was performed in 0 5 m na2so4 solutions with a cathodic potential of 0 5 v vs sce an amplitude of 0 01 v and alternating frequency of 10 1 104 hz 3 results and discussion 3 1 electrochemical h2o2 generation the stability of the nade for h2o2 electroproduction in the various water matrices were evaluated based on the aces of h2o2 production observed during the multi cycle experiments as shown in fig 2 aces of h2o2 production fluctuated within 83 92 and exhibited no clear declining trend during 80 h of experiments in synthetic na2so4 solutions in addition the presence of ha did not considerably influence aces of h2o2 production during 60 h of experiments as compared to those obtained in the absence of ha in contrast aces decreased gradually during electrolysis in the ca containing solutions na2so4 ca and na2so4 ca ha and the selected municipal wastewater after 60 h experiments aces decreased from initially 90 to 52 73 and 60 for the na2so4 ca and na2so4 ca ha solutions and the selected wastewater respectively the decrease of aces indicates that side reactions such as h2o2 reduction to h2o are promoted at the nade as it is continuously used in these water matrices xia et al 2021 due to the decrease of aces the energy consumption of h2o2 production will increase considerably during water treatment li et al 2021b yang et al 2018 moreover the performance of water treatment may be affected because of the decreased h2o2 electroproduction salmerón et al 2021 therefore for energy efficient and robust water treatment it is necessary to maintain high and stable aces of h2o2 electroproduction over long term operation and varying conditions the results shown in fig 2 demonstrate that the water matrix has a significant effect on the nade stability during h2o2 electroproduction although the nade maintained a good stability during h2o2 electroproduction in na2so4 electrolyte solutions which has been often reported in previous studies an et al 2020 muddemann et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 the nade stability deteriorated during h2o2 electroproduction in the ca containing solutions and selected wastewater these observations highlight that the high stability of nade observed in pure electrolyte e g na2so4 solutions cannot be indiscriminately projected for real water matrices in addition the results suggest that inorganic and or organic constituents that are commonly present in real water matrices e g ca2 and ha have distinctively different effects on the nade stability the presence of ca2 in na2so4 solutions resulted in considerable deteriorations of the nade stability for h2o2 electroproduction in contrast the presence of ha did not substantially influence the nade stability and even slowed down the ca induced deterioration of the nade stability when present in common with ca2 fig 2 these comparisons suggest that ca2 is possibly the main water constituent that caused the deterioration of nade stability during h2o2 electroproduction in the selected wastewater 3 2 electrode characterizations concomitant with the decrease of aces during h2o2 electroproduction in the ca containing water matrices i e na2so4 ca na2so4 ca ha and ww increasing precipitations were observed on the nade surface see si figs s1 and s2 for the photograph and sem images in contrast insignificant precipitations were observed on the nade surface when the nade was used in the na2so4 and na2so4 ha solutions for 60 h si figs s1b and c ftir and xrd analyses indicate that the precipitations on the ca 60 ca ha 60 and ww 60 nades consisted of predominantly caco3 in the calcite crystal form see si figs s5 and s5 in addition the characteristic peak of mg o 450 cm 1 was observed in the ftir spectra of the ww 60 nade which suggests that mg oh 2 precipitations were also formed on the nade surface during h2o2 electroproduction in the selected wastewater as shown in eq 1 h is continuously consumed at the nade during h2o2 electroproduction which results in a high local ph at the nade li et al 2021b as a result ca2 and mg2 in the water matrix can react co2 diffused from the air and oh to form considerable precipitations on the nade during h2o2 electroproduction li et al 2021b murawski et al 2021 in contrast the ftir spectra of nades used in the na2so4 and na2so4 ha solutions were generally similar to that of the virgin nade si figs 5 which confirms insignificant accumulation of na2so4 or ha on the nade surface during h2o2 electroproduction in the two water matrices unlike the white dense caco3 scale formed on the ca 60 nade si fig s1e the scale on the ca ha 60 nade was a loosely packed grey brown layer with many pores and fissures in the structure si fig s1h similarly the precipitation layer on the ww 60 nade also had many tiny pores si fig s1k these differences can be probably attributed to the co precipitation of caco3 and organics ha and dom during h2o2 electroproduction in the ca ha 60 and selected wastewater although ha dom is usually negatively charged and thus will not be significantly adsorbed on the cathode due to electrostatic repulsion they can be entrapped by caco3 precipitates and then co deposit on the nade surface when present in common with ca2 in the water matrix the precipitated organics can then be partially oxidized by electro generated h2o2 or reactive oxygen species e g oh generated from h2o2 decomposition berenguer et al 2010 chiu et al 2013 zhan et al 2016 thus resulting in the pores and fissures in the precipitation layer see si fig s10 for more information table 2 shows the surface elemental composition of the nades measured by sem eds the surface elemental composition of the virgin nade was predominantly c 79 6 and f 18 6 which reflects the pristine elemental composition of the carbon ptfe mixture after the nade was used for 60 h of h2o2 electroproduction in na2so4 solutions the c content decreased slightly whereas the f and o contents increased these changes can be possibly attributed to the oxidation of carbon by electro generated h2o2 during the process salmerón et al 2021 xia et al 2020 in addition it is noticed that the na content was only 0 2 on the na2so4 60 nade surface which suggests that na precipitation was insignificant due to the high solubility of na2so4 naoh compared with the na2so4 80 nade the ha 60 nade had a lower c content and a higher o content table 2 which can be possibly attributed to the adsorption of ha or its oxidized transformation products on the nade during h2o2 electroproduction in the na2so4 ha solutions see si fig s10 for more information notably due to the covering of the nade surface by mineral precipitates the surface elemental composition of ca 60 ca ha 60 and ww 60 nades changed dramatically as compared to that of the virgin nade see table 2 for the three nades the c content decreased dramatically and f was undetected by the eds technique meanwhile the o and ca content increased significantly these changes indicate that the surface of the three nades had been fully covered by caco3 precipitations therefore the eds spectra reflects essentially the elemental composition of caco3 further analysis revealed that mineral precipitations were not only formed on the nade surface but also inside the porous structure of nades as shown in si fig s3 considerable white mineral deposits were observed on the nickel mesh inside the ww 60 nade this observation indicates that during h2o2 electroproduction water has intruded into the interior of the nade where ca2 and mg2 react with co3 2 and oh to form caco3 and mg oh 2 precipitates respectively the formation of caco3 precipitation in the nade pores can also be discerned from the changes of pore volume distribution of carbon ptfe composite during h2o2 electroproduction in ca containing solutions as shown in fig 3 the pore volume of carbon ptfe composite in the range of 10 25 nm decreased considerably as the nade was continuously used for h2o2 electroproduction in na2so4 ca solutions in contrast when the caco3 precipitates were removed from the ca 90 nade by citric acid wash see si fig 1f the pore volume of carbon ptfe composite was almost fully restored to that of the virgin nade fig 3 these observations confirm that considerable caco3 precipitations were formed in the nade pores during h2o2 electroproduction in the ca containing water matrix and then removed by acid wash it should be noted that because of the superhydrophobicity of ptef and the high roughness of the micro nanostructured electrode surface see si fig s2 for sem images the nade can retain a stable gas film at the electrode surface when it is immersed in the water and water cannot intrude into the nade internal pores initially see si fig s4 for more information xia et al 2021 however upon cathodic polarization during h2o2 electroproduction the water ca between solid and liquid decreases according to the lippmann young equation eq 3 i e the electrocapillary effect kang 2002 mchale et al 2019 3 cos θ cos θ 0 ε 0 ε r 2 d γ lg u 2 where θ0 and θ are the ca between solid and liquid under unpolarized u 0 and polarized u u conditions respectively γ lg is the interface tension of liquid gas ε0 and εr are the absolute dielectric constant in vacuum and the relative dielectric constant of dielectric respectively d is the average thickness of dielectric u is applied voltage between the electrode and electrolyte consequently water can intrude into the internal pores of the nade during h2o2 electroproduction an et al 2022 an et al 2019 xia et al 2021 due to the water intrusion a triple phase interface tpi among the air water and electrode is formed inside the nade where o2 h and e from the three phases react together to yield h2o2 eq 1 an et al 2019 xia et al 2021 therefore the water intrusion has been considered a critical process for h2o2 electroproduction during electrolysis with the nades an et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 however the result presented herein suggest that the water intrusion can also lead to significant caco3 precipitation in the nade pores besides decreasing the pore volume of nade fig 3 the caco3 precipitates dramatically decreased the hydrophobicity of nades as shown in table 2 and si fig 7a the virgin nade surface had a water ca of 142 8 indicating the intrinsic superhydrophobicity of carbon ptfe composite xia et al 2021 after the nade was used for h2o2 electroproduction in na2so4 solutions for 80 h the water ca decreased slightly to 129 4 si fig s7b this decrease can be possibly attributed to the oxidation of carbon by electro generated h2o2 which can introduce some oxygen functional groups on the carbon surface and thus increase its hydrophilicity xia et al 2020 nevertheless due to the cathodic protection effect the oxidation of carbon is usually not severe during h2o2 electroproduction ania and beguin 2008 xia et al 2020 and thus did not considerably change the wettability of the nade in contrast the ca decreased considerably to 33 3 when the nade was used for 60 h in na2so4 ha solutions and became unmeasurable when the nades had been used for 10 h in the ca containing solutions na2so4 ca and na2so4 ca ha and the selected wastewater water drop was instantly adsorbed when it was added to the nade surface see si fig s7 by acid washing to remove mineral precipitates on the ca 60 ca ha 60 and ww 60 nades the ca was effectively restored to 103 129 si figs s7f i and l these changes confirm that the decrease of hydrophobicity of the nades is mainly caused by the deposition of caco3 precipitates on the nades during h2o2 electroproduction overall the results presented above demonstrate that during h2o2 electroproduction ca2 in the water matrix can form significant amounts of caco3 precipitates on the surface and in the internal pores of nades and these precipitates can considerably change the properties of nade coincident with the accumulation of caco3 precipitations aces of h2o2 production decreased gradually during electrolysis in the ca containing water matrices notably when the ca 60 nade was washed with citric acid to remove caco3 precipitates and used again for h2o2 electroproduction in na2so4 ca solutions aces was immediately restored to 80 see fig 2 however aces then decreased quickly back to 55 after 10 h experiments in the na2so4 ca solutions interestingly when the ca 70 nade was washed again with citric acid and then used for h2o2 production in na2so4 solutions it maintained stable aces of 77 81 during the following 16 h experiments these comparisons confirm that the formation of caco3 precipitation on nades is the main cause for the deterioration of nade stability during h2o2 electroproduction 3 3 electrochemical measurements 3 3 1 cv analysis to evaluate the effects of water constituents on nade electrochemical properties the nades used in the different water matrices were characterized by cv and eis techniques based on the obtained cv curves the electroactive surface area easa of the nades are calculated see si fig s8 for calculation details as reported in table 3 the easa of the nade increased continuously as it was used for h2o2 electroproduction in na2so4 solutions this observation can be mainly attributed to the progressive water intrusion into the internal pores of the nade during h2o2 electroproduction which increases the water electrode interface and allows electroactive sites inside the nade pores to be accessible to the fe cn 6 3 fe cn 6 4 redox reaction an et al 2019 xia et al 2021 similarly the easa of nades used in na2so4 ca and na2so4 ca ha solutions increased in the first 10 20 h of h2o2 electroproduction table 3 however the easa then decreased with further increasing the electrolysis time in the two ca2 containing solutions for the nades used in na2so4 ca solutions the easa decreased to only 1 05 cm2 after 60 h experiments and citric acid wash restored the easa of ca 90 nade to 11 43 cm2 which is comparable to that of the na2so4 80 nade these comparisons suggest that water had similarly intruded into the internal pores of the nades during h2o2 electroproduction in the na2so4 and na2so4 ca solutions thus increasing the easa of nades however due to the increasing caco3 precipitates on electroactive sites inside the nade pores the easa then decreased as the nade was continuously used in the ca containing solutions the caco3 precipitates could then be largely removed by citric acid washing which thus restored the easa of ca 90 nade to a similar level as that of the na2so4 80 nade compared with the ca 60 nade the ca ha 60 nade retained a higher easa of 3 31 cm2 table 3 this result agrees with the previous observations that ha can mitigate the ca induced precipitation on the nades during h2o2 electroproduction see si fig s1 this also explains why the ca ha 60 nade retained a higher ace of h2o2 electroproduction than the ca 60 nade fig 2 however citric acid wash then only restored the easa of ca ha 60w nade to 5 71 cm2 table 3 meanwhile it is noticed that the easa of ha 60 nade that had been used for h2o2 electroproduction for 60 h in na2so4 ha solutions was considerably smaller than that of the na2so4 80 nade 6 34 vs 11 25 table 3 these data suggest that ha can also cause decreases of the easa of nade possibly due to the adsorption of ha and or its oxidation transformation products in the carbon ptfe pores moreover it seems that the ha induced electrode fouling cannot be effectively recovered by citric acid washing as shown for the caco3 precipitates intriguingly the easa of nades used in the wastewater decreased firstly but then increased during the experiments which is in contrast to the trends observed for the nades used in the synthetic solutions see table 3 this difference can be possibly attributed to the different constituents of the synthetic solutions and the selected wastewater besides ca2 and ha the selected wastewater had complex inorganic and organic constituents see table 1 and si fig s11 for more information possibly some organics in the wastewater e g surfactants can be quickly adsorbed by the carbon ptfe composites thus resulting in the initial decrease of the easa of nade in the first 10 h on the other hand the ca2 content of the wastewater 92 7 mg l is considerably lower than that of the ca containing synthetic solutions 200 mg l ca2 therefore caco3 induced easa decrease is probably less significant during h2o2 electroproduction in the wastewater than in the ca containing synthetic solutions due to the less significant caco3 precipitation and the progressive water intrusion into the nade during h2o2 electroproduction the easa of the nade used in the wastewater then increased gradually with further increasing the experiment time table 3 3 3 2 eis analysis fig 4 shows the high frequency part of nyquist plots of the virgin nade and nades that had been used for h2o2 electroproduction in na2so4 solutions with and without ca2 see si fig s9 for the plots of nades used in other water matrices with increasing the electrolysis time the nyquist plot of the nades shifts to the right of the real axis and the radius of the semicircles increased these observations indicate that the electrochemical impedance of the nades changed considerably during the h2o2 electroproduction process to get more insight into the changes an equivalent circuit rs cpedl rct cadrad was employed to fit the eis data see the inset of fig 4 alcaide et al 2002 2003 in the equivalent circuit rs represents the electrolyte solution resistance rct represents the 2e orr charge transfer resistance cad and rad are the capacitance and resistance for oxygen adsorption cpedl is a constant phase element representing the characteristics of electric double layer capacitor edlc compared with the virgin nade the rs of the na2so4 80 nade increased by 13 5 table 3 indicating that the h transference impedance increased moderately meanwhile the rad and cad of the na2so4 80 nade increased by 99 2 and 78 0 respectively suggesting a considerable increase in the resistance of oxygen adsorption in the nade on the other hand the rct of the na2so4 80 nade decreased by 16 4 relative to that of the virgin nade which suggests that the electron transfer impedance between the electrode and water decreased moderately during h2o2 electroproduction overall these changes can be mainly attributed to the water intrusion into the nade pores during h2o2 electroproduction an et al 2019 xia et al 2021 due to the progressive water intrusion the tpi among water air and electrode is pushed into the depth of the nade during h2o2 electroproduction as a result h in the solution have to diffuse longer paths to reach the tpi inside the nade before they can react with o2 and e to form h2o2 consequently the solution resistance rs of orr increased during h2o2 electroproduction with the nades meanwhile due to the wetting of nade pores by intruding water the adsorption of o2 at the tpi is impeded whereas the charge transfer between the electrode and water is facilitated giomo et al 2008 hence the capacitance and resistance for oxygen adsorption cad and rad increased while the charge transfer resistance rct decreased during h2o2 electroproduction in na2so4 solutions table 3 due to the influence of nade properties e g pore volume and wettability by deposited mineral scale and or adsorbed organics the changes of eis of nades during h2o2 electroproduction in the ca containing solutions and the selected wastewater are more complex table 3 at the present stage only several general inferences can be made based on the fitted eis results i in the ca2 containing solution na2so4 ca and na2so4 ca ha the rs of nades increased more significantly during h2o2 electroproduction than in the ca2 free solutions na2so4 and na2so4 ha this difference is probably caused by the deposition of caco3 in the nade pores which reduces the pore size and thus increases the resistance of h diffusion to the tpi inside the nades ii in the ca containing synthetic solutions na2so4 ca2 and na2so4 ca2 ha the rct of nades decreased in the first 10 h but then increased with further increasing electrolysis time this trend is consistent with the changes of easa of the nades during h2o2 electroproduction in the ca containing solutions table 3 and can be possibly explained by the water intrusion and ensuing accumulation of caco3 deposits at the tpi nevertheless the rct of nades used in the selected wastewater fluctuated considerably and exhibited no clear changing trends during h2o2 electroproduction possibly due to the more complex effects of wastewater constituents on nade properties iii during h2o2 electroproduction in the synthetic solutions and wastewater the cad and rad of nades increased relative to that of the virgin nade these increases can be possibly attributed to the decrease of hydrophobicity of the nades by adsorbed organics and or deposited minerals which increases the resistance of oxygen adsorption at the tpi iv by acid washing to remove caco3 scale from the nades both the rs and rct of the nades were decreased this finding suggests that the accumulation of caco3 in a major cause for the increased solution resistance and electron transfer resistance during h2o2 electroproduction in the ca containing solutions and selected wastewater 3 4 effects of mineral precipitates on nade stability for h2o2 electroproduction based on this information presented above a simplified scheme is proposed to illustrate the deterioration process of nade stability during h2o2 electroproduction in ca containing water matrices fig 5 due to the superaerophilicity of carbon ptfe composite the virgin nade retains a gas film at the electrode surface when it is immersed into the water si fig s4 therefore only limited triple phase points exist at the microscopically rugged nade surface see fig s2b and fig 5c xia et al 2021 upon cathodic polarization during h2o2 electroproduction water intrudes into the pores of carbon ptfe composite because of the electrocapillary effect fig 5d as a result a tpi among the gas water and electrode is generated in the nade pores at the tpi o2 h and e react together to yield h2o2 which then desorbs from the orr sites and diffuses into the solution as the final product fig 5d simultaneous with h2o2 electroproduction co2 and oh react with ca2 and mg2 to form caco3 and mg oh 2 precipitates on the surface and in the pores of the nade due to the electrocapillary effect and the decrease of nade hydrophobicity by caco3 precipitates water intrudes progressively into the depth of the nade during h2o2 electroproduction fig 5e along with the water intrusion increasing caco3 precipitates are generated on the surface and in the pores of nade the accumulation of caco3 precipitates on the nade can negatively influence orr to h2o2 in several ways firstly caco3 precipitates may cover the orr sites at the tpi thus impeding the h2o2 production process fig 5d moreover the deposition of caco3 precipitates reduces the pore size and may even block the entrance of some small pores inside the nade thus impeding h diffusion to the tpi murawski et al 2021 meanwhile the mineral deposits decrease the hydrophobicity of the nade which is unfavorable for oxygen adsorption and h2o2 desorption at the tpi consequently further reduction of the electro produced h2o2 to h2o may be promoted at the tpi furthermore the decrease of nade hydrophobicity also increases the chance of h2o2 being adsorbed and reduced at the nade pore walls when h2o2 diffuses through the nade channels to the bulk solution see fig 5e due to these reasons the ace of h2o2 production decreased during the multi cycle experiments conducted in the ca containing solutions and selected wastewater fig 2 acid wash can effectively remove mineral precipitates and thus largely restore the porosity and hydrophobicity of nades see table 2 hence the ace of h2o2 production could be temporarily restored by acid wash see fig 2 however because some mineral nucleus may remain in the nade pores after acid wash fig 5f which can accelerate the re growth of mineral crystals the ace of h2o2 production then decreased quickly again as the acid washed nade is reused in the ca containing solutions fig 2 3 5 practical implications overall the results presented above demonstrate that under relevant conditions of water and wastewater treatment e g ca2 concentrations of 92 7 200 mg l considerable amounts of caco3 precipitates can be formed on the nades during a short period of h2o2 electroproduction e g 60 h the accumulation of caco3 in nade pores can considerably change the nade properties and negatively influence the orr process in several ways consequently aces of h2o2 production decreased substantially during h2o2 electroproduction in ca containing water matrices although acid wash can temporarily restore the performance of the nades for h2o2 electroproduction the performance will deteriorate again quickly when the nades are continuously used in the ca containing water matrices moreover the generation of acid washing effluent is undesired in practical applications especially in decentralized water treatment systems where low maintenance operation is desired besides ca2 and mg2 some organic constituents in real water matrix e g surfactants may also cause electrode fouling and affect h2o2 electroproduction these results suggest that in practical applications directly producing h2o2 with nades in the water matrix that contains significant electrode fouling constituents e g ca2 and mg2 is possibly problematic from the perspective of long term stable operations to maintain stable h2o2 electroproduction with the nades during practical water and wastewater treatment several strategies may be taken to mitigate electrode fouling for example when the water matrix that needs to be treated contains high concentrations of ca2 and mg2 pretreatment such as lime soda softening and ion exchange may be used to remove these cations before h2o2 electroproduction with the nades alternatively a relatively clean water source e g tap water with low ca2 mg2 and dom contents may be used to produce high concentration h2o2 solutions in a separate electrochemical reactor with nades the concentrated h2o2 solution can then be fed to the water matrix that needs to be treated by h2o2 based aops such as fenton o3 h2o2 and uv h2o2 process dobelle et al 2021 li et al 2021b xia et al 2020 4 conclusions water constituents commonly present in real water matrices especially ca2 can cause serious electrode fouling and thus deteriorate the stability of nades during h2o2 electroproduction in water and wastewater treatment during h2o2 electroproduction ca2 can form significant amounts of caco3 precipitates on the surface and in the pores of nades the caco3 precipitates can block the active sites of orr imped h and electron transfer and affect oxygen adsorption and h2o2 desorption involved in orr to h2o2 moreover the caco3 precipitates decreased the hydrophobicity of the nades which promotes the side reaction of h2o2 reduction due to these effects the current efficiency of h2o2 production decreased continuously during electrolysis with the nades in the ca containing water matrices overall the results of this study indicate that the water matrix has a significant effect on the stability of nades for h2o2 electroproduction during water and wastewater treatment the good stability of nades observed in synthetic electrolyte solutions cannot be indiscriminately projected for real water matrix for stable h2o2 electroproduction over long term operations proper strategies are needed to mitigate the fouling of nades by the water constituents during water and wastewater treatment declaration of

15275,electrochemically producing hydrogen peroxide h2o2 from oxygen reduction reaction orr with natural air diffusion electrode nade is an attractive way to supply h2o2 for decentralized water treatment in this study the stability of nade during h2o2 electroproduction in varying water matrices were evaluated including synthetic electrolyte solutions 0 05 m na2so4 with or without calcium ions ca2 200 mg l and or humic acid ha 40 mg l as well as a selected municipal wastewater 92 7 mg l ca2 3 6 mg l mg2 and 23 9 mg l total organic carbon the results show that nades maintained a good stability during h2o2 electroproduction in na2so4 solutions regardless of the presence of ha however ca2 and mg2 could form significant amounts of mineral precipitates on the surface and in the internal pores of nades during h2o2 electroproduction these mineral precipitates can negatively influence h2o2 production by impeding the oxygen electron and proton transfer processes involved in orr to h2o2 moreover the mineral precipitates shifted the nades from hydrophobic to hydrophilic which may promote h2o2 reduction to h2o at the nades consequently the apparent current efficiencies of h2o2 production decreased substantially from initially 90 to 50 70 as the nades were continuously used for 60 h in the ca containing solutions and selected wastewater these results indicate that water constituents that are commonly present in real water matrices especially ca2 can cause serious deterioration of nade stability during h2o2 electroproduction therefore proper strategies are needed to mitigate electrode fouling during h2o2 electroproduction with nades in practical water and wastewater treatment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords calcium electrode fouling gas

processes aops for water and wastewater treatment such as the fenton fe2 h2o2 ultraviolet uv h2o2 and peroxone o3 h2o2 processes miklos et al 2018 o s santos et al 2022 von gunten 2018 however the risks associated with the transport and storage of h2o2 stocks e g explosion and corrosion have limited its practical applications especially in decentralized water treatment systems where frequent replenishment of chemical reagents is undesired von gunten 2018 yang et al 2018 zhou et al 2019 to avoid the risks of h2o2 stocks and support low maintenance water treatment electrochemical production of h2o2 from two electron oxygen reduction reaction orr eq 1 has been proposed as an attractive alternative to produce h2o2 on site and on demand for decentralized applications barazesh et al 2015 brillas et al 2009 li et al 2013 o s santos et al 2022 1 2 h o 2 2 e h 2 o 2 a number of studies have shown that h2o2 can be electrochemically produced in various water matrices e g natural water and

electrochemical h2o2 production several electrochemically driven aops eaops such as the electro fenton electro peroxone and e uv h2o2 processes have been developed barazesh et al 2015 brillas et al 1996 frangos et al 2016 oturan et al 2000 yuan et al 2013 these eaops can generally achieve similar or even better water treatment performance compared to the conventional h2o2 based aops thus offering a more flexible and safer alternative for decentralized water treatment brillas et al 2009 salmerón et al 2018 von gunten 2018 wang et al 2018 natural air diffusion electrode nade is a promising type of gas diffusion electrode gde for electro generating h2o2 from orr for decentralized water treatment li et al 2021a zhang et al 2020 the nade has a superhydrophobic gas diffusion layer that allows oxygen in the atmosphere to diffuse actively to orr sites on the catalyst layer for h2o2 electroproduction thus by directly utilizing oxygen in the air the nade can avoid the need of external gas pumps required for conventional gdes zhang et al 2020 this considerably facilitates the construction of compact and low maintenance electrochemical reactors for decentralized applications stably producing h2o2 over long term operation and varying conditions is crucial for the low maintenance water treatment in decentralized systems li et al 2021b perry et al 2021 yang et al 2018 zhou et al 2019 however to date only a few studies have evaluated the stability of gdes for h2o2 production in real water matrices e g natural water and wastewater barazesh et al 2015 li et al 2021b in contrast most studies evaluated the stability of gdes only in synthetic solutions prepared with pure water and supporting electrolytes e g sodium sulfate na2so4 an et al 2022 an et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 zhao et al 2019 although it has often been reported that gdes can maintain a good stability in synthetic solutions these results may not be applied to real water matrix for example a recent study showed that the current efficiencies of h2o2 production decreased gradually from 95 to 70 during a 46 d trial of electroproduction of h2o2 in a selected groundwater li et al 2021b simultaneous with the deterioration of h2o2 production increasing amounts of precipitations were observed on the gde surface li et al 2021b therefore it has been hypothesized that the deterioration of the gde performance may be partly attributed to the electrode fouling by inorganic and or organic constituents in the groundwater e g calcium ions ca2 and dissolved organic matter dom li et al 2021b salmerón et al 2021 the main objective of this study was to examine the effects of water constituents that are commonly present in real water matrices on the stability of nade for h2o2 electroproduction home made nades were tested in multi cycle experiments of h2o2 electroproduction in synthetic electrolyte solutions 0 05 m na2so4 in the absence and presence of ca2 and or humic acid ha as well in a selected municipal wastewater apparent current efficiencies aces of h2o2 electroproduction during the multi cycle tests were determined to evaluate the stability of the nades the evolution of physiochemical and electrochemical properties of the nades during the tests were characterized with various techniques to reveal the effects of water constituents on nade stability based on the

water battilani et al 2010 leong et al 2017 van voorthuizen et al 2005 in addition to simulate h2o2 electroproduction under typical ph in water and wastewater treatment circumneutral to weakly basic ph the synthetic solutions were buffered with borate at ph 8 during the experiments a municipal wastewater sample was collected at the inlet of the wastewater treatment plant on tsinghua university campus and tested as a potential water source for water reuse in decentralized applications barazesh et al 2015 yang et al 2018 after collection the selected wastewater was filtered through a polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe fiber filter with a mesh number of 400 to remove suspended solids the main water quality parameters of the selected wastewater are summarized in table 1 2 2 electrode preparation the carbon ptfe electrode was prepared with vulcan xc 72 carbon powder cabot co ltd u s a ptfe dispersion 60 wt hesen co ltd china and anhydrous alcohol sinopharm co ltd china following a previously described protocol wang et al 2012 in brief a mixture of 3 g carbon black powder 4 ml ptfe dispersion and 40 ml of anhydrous alcohol was mixed in an ultrasonic bath for 15 min next the mixture was agitated continually with a glass rod on an electric furnace at 150 c to evaporate any alcohol the resulting xc 72 carbon ptfe cake was then compressed in a roller press to form a sheet with a thickness of about 1 mm two pieces of the carbon ptfe sheet and a piece of nickel mesh were sandwiched and then pressed together at a pressure of 20 mpa for 1 min to form the electrode finally the electrode was sintered in a muffle furnace at 350 c for 1 h in air 2 3 electrochemical h2o2 production multi cycle experiments of electrochemical h2o2 production was conducted in a polymethyl methacarylate reactor with an effective volume of 0 3 l 7 6 9 cm see fig 1 a pt sheet and a carbon ptfe nade with a projected area of 3 cm 3 cm were employed as the anode and cathode respectively the pt anode was used in this study because the high stability of pt can avoid the change of anode properties from influencing the experimental results e g h2o2 production during the multi cycle experiments to evaluate the effects of inorganic and organic constituents on the stability of nade multi cycle experiments of electrochemical h2o2 production were performed with synthetic electrolyte solutions 0 05 m na2so4 in di water in the absence and presence of 200 mg l ca2 and or 18 4 mg l ha as well as with the selected municipal wastewater during the multi cycle experiments the nades were continuously used whereas the solutions were replaced with freshly prepared solutions every 2 h however for the experiments with na2so4 ha solutions and the selected wastewater the solutions were replaced every 12 h due to the relatively high cost of ha sample and the limited volume of collected wastewater sample during each cycle of experiments h2o2 concentrations were measured at 15 min with a spectrophotometer at 402 nm dr 5000 hitachi co ltd japan using the potassium titanium iv oxalate method sellers 1980 the apparent current efficiency ace of h2o2 electroproduction was calculated

warsinger et al 2015 during the acid wash the solution was gently stirred with a magnetic stirrer at 300 rpm the acid washed nades were then flushed with di water for several times to remove any residual acid and naturally dried before they were used again for electrochemical h2o2 production for simplicity the gdes that had been used for x hours of electrochemical h2o2 production in na2so4

washed are indicated by the suffix aw in the name for example ca 60 aw and ca ha 60 aw 2 4 electrode characterizations the morphologies of virgin and used nades were examined by a zeiss merlin scanning electron microscopy energy disperse spectroscopy sem eds zeiss co ltd germany the contact angle ca of the electrode surface was measured by an oca 25 optical contact angle measuring device

5 v vs sce an amplitude of 0 01 v and alternating frequency of 10 1 104 hz 3 results and discussion 3 1 electrochemical h2o2 generation the stability of the nade for h2o2 electroproduction in the various water matrices were evaluated based on the aces of h2o2 production observed during the multi cycle experiments as shown in fig 2 aces of h2o2 production fluctuated within 83 92 and exhibited no clear declining trend during 80 h of experiments in synthetic na2so4 solutions in addition the presence of ha did not considerably influence aces of h2o2 production during 60 h of experiments as compared to those obtained in the absence of ha in contrast aces decreased gradually during electrolysis in the ca containing solutions na2so4 ca and na2so4 ca ha and the selected municipal wastewater after 60 h experiments aces decreased from initially 90 to 52 73 and 60 for the na2so4 ca and na2so4 ca ha solutions and the selected wastewater respectively the decrease of aces indicates that side reactions such as h2o2 reduction to h2o are promoted at the nade as it is continuously used in these water matrices xia et al 2021 due to the decrease of aces the energy consumption of h2o2 production will increase considerably during water treatment li et al 2021b yang et al 2018 moreover the performance of water treatment may be affected because of the decreased h2o2 electroproduction salmerón et al 2021 therefore for energy efficient and robust water treatment it is necessary to maintain high and stable aces of h2o2 electroproduction over long term operation and varying conditions the results shown in fig 2 demonstrate that the water matrix has a significant effect on the nade stability during h2o2 electroproduction although the nade maintained a good stability during h2o2 electroproduction in na2so4 electrolyte solutions which has been often reported in previous studies an et al 2020 muddemann et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 the nade stability deteriorated during h2o2 electroproduction in the ca containing solutions and selected wastewater these observations highlight that the high stability of nade observed in pure electrolyte e g na2so4 solutions cannot be indiscriminately projected for real water matrices in addition the results suggest that inorganic and or organic constituents that are commonly present in real water matrices e g ca2 and ha have distinctively different effects on the nade stability the presence of ca2 in na2so4 solutions resulted in considerable deteriorations of the nade stability for h2o2 electroproduction in contrast the presence of ha did not substantially influence the nade stability and even slowed down the ca induced deterioration of the nade stability when present in common with ca2 fig 2 these comparisons suggest that ca2 is possibly the main water constituent that caused the deterioration of nade stability during h2o2 electroproduction in the selected wastewater 3 2 electrode characterizations concomitant with the decrease of aces during h2o2 electroproduction in the ca containing water matrices i e na2so4 ca na2so4 ca ha and ww increasing precipitations were observed on the nade surface see si figs s1 and s2 for the photograph and sem images in contrast insignificant precipitations were observed on the nade surface when the nade was used in the na2so4 and na2so4 ha solutions for 60 h si figs s1b and c ftir and xrd analyses indicate that the precipitations on the ca 60 ca ha 60 and ww 60 nades consisted of predominantly caco3 in the calcite crystal form see si figs s5 and s5 in addition the characteristic peak of mg o 450 cm 1 was observed in the ftir spectra of the ww 60 nade which suggests that mg oh 2 precipitations were also formed on the nade surface during h2o2 electroproduction in the selected wastewater as shown in eq 1 h is continuously consumed at the nade during h2o2 electroproduction which results in a high local ph at the nade li et al 2021b as a result ca2 and mg2 in the water matrix can react co2 diffused from the air and oh to form considerable precipitations on the nade during h2o2 electroproduction li et al 2021b murawski et al 2021 in contrast the ftir spectra of nades used in the na2so4 and na2so4 ha solutions were generally similar to that of the virgin nade si figs 5 which confirms insignificant accumulation of na2so4 or ha on the nade surface during h2o2 electroproduction in the two water matrices unlike the white dense caco3 scale formed on the ca 60 nade si fig s1e the scale on the ca ha 60 nade was a loosely packed grey brown layer with many pores and fissures in the structure si fig s1h similarly the precipitation layer on the ww 60 nade also had many tiny pores si fig s1k these differences can be probably attributed to the co precipitation of caco3 and organics ha and dom during h2o2 electroproduction in the ca ha 60 and selected wastewater although ha dom is usually negatively charged and thus will not be significantly adsorbed on the cathode due to electrostatic repulsion they can be entrapped by caco3 precipitates and then co deposit on the nade surface when present in common with ca2 in the water matrix the precipitated organics can then be partially oxidized by electro generated h2o2 or reactive oxygen species e g oh generated from h2o2 decomposition berenguer et al 2010 chiu et al 2013 zhan et al 2016 thus resulting in the pores and fissures in the precipitation layer see si fig s10 for more information table 2 shows the surface elemental composition of the nades measured by sem eds the surface elemental composition of the virgin nade was predominantly c 79 6 and f 18 6 which reflects the pristine elemental composition of the carbon ptfe mixture after the nade was used for 60 h of h2o2 electroproduction in na2so4 solutions the c content decreased slightly whereas the f and o contents increased these changes can be possibly attributed to the oxidation of carbon by electro generated h2o2 during the process salmerón et al 2021 xia et al 2020 in addition it is noticed that the na content was only 0 2 on the na2so4 60 nade surface which suggests that na precipitation was insignificant due to the high solubility of na2so4 naoh compared with the na2so4 80 nade the ha 60 nade had a lower c content and a higher o content table 2 which can be possibly attributed to the adsorption of ha or its oxidized transformation products on the nade during h2o2 electroproduction in the na2so4 ha solutions see si fig s10 for more information notably due to the covering of the nade surface by mineral precipitates the surface elemental composition of ca 60 ca ha 60 and ww 60 nades changed dramatically as compared to that of the virgin nade see table 2 for the three nades the c content decreased dramatically and f was undetected by the eds technique meanwhile the o and ca content increased significantly these changes indicate that the surface of the three nades had been fully covered by caco3 precipitations therefore the eds spectra reflects essentially the elemental composition of caco3 further analysis revealed that mineral precipitations were not only formed on the nade surface but also inside the porous structure of nades as shown in si fig s3 considerable white mineral deposits were observed on the nickel mesh inside the ww 60 nade this observation indicates that during h2o2 electroproduction water has intruded into the interior of the nade where ca2 and mg2 react with co3 2 and oh to form caco3 and mg oh 2 precipitates respectively the formation of caco3 precipitation in the nade pores can also be discerned from the changes of pore volume distribution of carbon ptfe composite during h2o2 electroproduction in ca containing solutions as shown in fig 3 the pore volume of carbon ptfe composite in the range of 10 25 nm decreased considerably as the nade was continuously used for h2o2 electroproduction in na2so4 ca solutions in contrast when the caco3 precipitates were removed from the ca 90 nade by citric acid wash see si fig 1f the pore volume of carbon ptfe composite was almost fully restored to that of the virgin nade fig 3 these observations confirm that considerable caco3 precipitations were formed in the nade pores during h2o2 electroproduction in the ca containing water matrix and then removed by acid wash it should be noted that because of the superhydrophobicity of ptef and the high roughness of the micro nanostructured electrode surface see si fig s2 for sem images the nade can retain a stable gas film at the electrode surface when it is immersed in the water and water cannot intrude into the nade internal pores initially see si fig s4 for more information xia et al 2021 however upon cathodic polarization during h2o2 electroproduction the water ca between solid and liquid decreases according to the lippmann young equation eq 3 i e the electrocapillary effect kang 2002 mchale et al 2019 3 cos θ cos θ 0 ε 0 ε r 2 d γ lg u 2 where θ0 and θ are the ca between solid and liquid under unpolarized u 0 and polarized u u conditions respectively γ lg is the interface tension of liquid gas ε0 and εr are the absolute dielectric constant in vacuum and the relative dielectric constant of dielectric respectively d is the average thickness of dielectric u is applied voltage between the electrode and electrolyte consequently water can intrude into the internal pores of the nade during h2o2 electroproduction an et al 2022 an et al 2019 xia et al 2021 due to the water intrusion a triple phase interface tpi among the air water and electrode is formed inside the nade where o2 h and e from the three phases react together to yield h2o2 eq 1 an et al 2019 xia et al 2021 therefore the water intrusion has been considered a critical process for h2o2 electroproduction during electrolysis with the nades an et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 however the result presented herein suggest that the water intrusion can also lead to significant caco3 precipitation in the nade pores besides decreasing the pore volume of nade fig 3 the caco3 precipitates dramatically decreased the hydrophobicity of nades as shown in table 2 and si fig 7a the virgin nade surface had a water ca of 142 8 indicating the intrinsic superhydrophobicity of carbon ptfe composite xia et al 2021 after the nade was used for h2o2 electroproduction in na2so4 solutions for 80 h the water ca decreased slightly to 129 4 si fig s7b this decrease can be possibly attributed to the oxidation of carbon by electro generated h2o2 which can introduce some oxygen functional groups on the carbon surface and thus increase its hydrophilicity xia et al 2020 nevertheless due to the cathodic protection effect the oxidation of carbon is usually not severe during h2o2 electroproduction ania and beguin 2008 xia et al 2020 and thus did not considerably change the wettability of the nade in contrast the ca decreased considerably to 33 3 when the nade was used for 60 h in na2so4 ha solutions and became unmeasurable when the nades had been used for 10 h in the ca containing solutions na2so4 ca and na2so4 ca ha and the selected wastewater water drop was instantly adsorbed when it was added to the nade surface see si fig s7 by acid washing to remove mineral precipitates on the ca 60 ca ha 60 and ww 60 nades the ca was effectively restored to 103 129 si figs s7f i and l these changes confirm that the decrease of hydrophobicity of the nades is mainly caused by the deposition of caco3 precipitates on the nades during h2o2 electroproduction overall the results presented above demonstrate that during h2o2 electroproduction ca2 in the water matrix can form significant amounts of caco3 precipitates on the surface and in the internal pores of nades and these precipitates can considerably change the properties of nade coincident with the accumulation of caco3 precipitations aces of h2o2 production decreased gradually during electrolysis in the ca containing water matrices notably when the ca 60 nade was washed with citric acid to remove caco3 precipitates and used again for h2o2 electroproduction in na2so4 ca solutions aces was immediately restored to 80 see fig 2 however aces then decreased quickly back to 55 after 10 h experiments in the na2so4 ca solutions interestingly when the ca 70 nade was washed again with citric acid and then used for h2o2 production in na2so4 solutions it maintained stable aces of 77 81 during the following 16 h experiments these comparisons confirm that the formation of caco3 precipitation on nades is the main cause for the deterioration of nade stability during h2o2 electroproduction 3 3 electrochemical measurements 3 3 1 cv analysis to evaluate the effects of water constituents on nade electrochemical properties the nades used in the different water matrices were characterized by cv and eis techniques based on the obtained cv curves the electroactive surface area easa of the nades are calculated see si fig s8 for calculation details as reported in table 3 the easa of the nade increased continuously as it was used for h2o2 electroproduction in na2so4 solutions this observation can be mainly attributed to the progressive water intrusion into the internal pores of the nade during h2o2 electroproduction which increases the water electrode interface and allows electroactive sites inside the nade pores to be accessible to the fe cn 6 3 fe cn 6 4 redox reaction an et al 2019 xia et al 2021 similarly the easa of nades used in na2so4 ca and na2so4 ca ha solutions increased in the first 10 20 h of h2o2 electroproduction table 3 however the easa then decreased with further increasing the electrolysis time in the two ca2 containing solutions for the nades used in na2so4 ca solutions the easa decreased to only 1 05 cm2 after 60 h experiments and citric acid wash restored the easa of ca 90 nade to 11 43 cm2 which is comparable to that of the na2so4 80 nade these comparisons suggest that water had similarly intruded into the internal pores of the nades during h2o2 electroproduction in the na2so4 and na2so4 ca solutions thus increasing the easa of nades however due to the increasing caco3 precipitates on electroactive sites inside the nade pores the easa then decreased as the nade was continuously used in the ca containing solutions the caco3 precipitates could then be largely removed by citric acid washing which thus restored the easa of ca 90 nade to a similar level as that of the na2so4 80 nade compared with the ca 60 nade the ca ha 60 nade retained a higher easa of 3 31 cm2 table 3 this result agrees with the previous observations that ha can mitigate the ca induced precipitation on the nades during h2o2 electroproduction see si fig s1 this also explains why the ca ha 60 nade retained a higher ace of h2o2 electroproduction than the ca 60 nade fig 2 however citric acid wash then only restored the easa of ca ha 60w nade to 5 71 cm2 table 3 meanwhile it is noticed that the easa of ha 60 nade that had been used for h2o2 electroproduction for 60 h in na2so4 ha solutions was considerably smaller than that of the na2so4 80 nade 6 34 vs 11 25 table 3 these data suggest that ha can also cause decreases of the easa of nade possibly due to the adsorption of ha and or its oxidation transformation products in the carbon ptfe pores moreover it seems that the ha induced electrode fouling cannot be effectively recovered by citric acid washing as shown for the caco3 precipitates intriguingly the easa of nades used in the wastewater decreased firstly but then increased during the experiments which is in contrast to the trends observed for the nades used in the synthetic solutions see table 3 this difference can be possibly attributed to the different constituents of the synthetic solutions and the selected wastewater besides ca2 and ha the selected wastewater had complex inorganic and organic constituents see table 1 and si fig s11 for more information possibly some organics in the wastewater e g surfactants can be quickly adsorbed by the carbon ptfe composites thus resulting in the initial decrease of the easa of nade in the first 10 h on the other hand the ca2 content of the wastewater 92 7 mg l is considerably lower than that of the ca containing synthetic solutions 200 mg l ca2 therefore caco3 induced easa decrease is probably less significant during h2o2 electroproduction in the wastewater than in the ca containing synthetic solutions due to the less significant caco3 precipitation and the progressive water intrusion into the nade during h2o2 electroproduction the easa of the nade used in the wastewater then increased gradually with further increasing the experiment time table 3 3 3 2 eis analysis fig 4 shows the high frequency part of nyquist plots of the virgin nade and nades that had been used for h2o2 electroproduction in na2so4 solutions with and without ca2 see si fig s9 for the plots of nades used in other water matrices with increasing the electrolysis time the nyquist plot of the nades shifts to the right of the real axis and the radius of the semicircles increased these observations indicate that the electrochemical impedance of the nades changed considerably during the h2o2 electroproduction process to get more insight into the changes an equivalent circuit rs cpedl rct cadrad was employed to fit the eis data see the inset of fig 4 alcaide et al 2002 2003 in the equivalent circuit rs represents the electrolyte solution resistance rct represents the 2e orr charge transfer resistance cad and rad are the capacitance and resistance for oxygen adsorption cpedl is a constant phase element representing the characteristics of electric double layer capacitor edlc compared with the virgin nade the rs of the na2so4 80 nade increased by 13 5 table 3 indicating that the h transference impedance increased moderately meanwhile the rad and cad of the na2so4 80 nade increased by 99 2 and 78 0 respectively suggesting a considerable increase in the resistance of oxygen adsorption in the nade on the other hand the rct of the na2so4 80 nade decreased by 16 4 relative to that of the virgin nade which suggests that the electron transfer impedance between the electrode and water decreased moderately during h2o2 electroproduction overall these changes can be mainly attributed to the water intrusion into the nade pores during h2o2 electroproduction an et al 2019 xia et al 2021 due to the progressive water intrusion the tpi among water air and electrode is pushed into the depth of the nade during h2o2 electroproduction as a result h in the solution have to diffuse longer paths to reach the tpi inside the nade before they can react with o2 and e to form h2o2 consequently the solution resistance rs of orr increased during h2o2 electroproduction with the nades meanwhile due to the wetting of nade pores by intruding water the adsorption of o2 at the tpi is impeded whereas the charge transfer between the electrode and water is facilitated giomo et al 2008 hence the capacitance and resistance for oxygen adsorption cad and rad increased while the charge transfer resistance rct decreased during h2o2 electroproduction in na2so4 solutions table 3 due to the influence of nade properties e g pore volume and wettability by deposited mineral scale and or adsorbed organics the changes of eis of nades during h2o2 electroproduction in the ca containing solutions and the selected wastewater are more complex table 3 at the present stage only several general inferences can be made based on the fitted eis results i in the ca2 containing solution na2so4 ca and na2so4 ca ha the rs of nades increased more significantly during h2o2 electroproduction than in the ca2 free solutions na2so4 and na2so4 ha this difference is probably caused by the deposition of caco3 in the nade pores which reduces the pore size and thus increases the resistance of h diffusion to the tpi inside the nades ii in the ca containing synthetic solutions na2so4 ca2 and na2so4 ca2 ha the rct of nades decreased in the first 10 h but then increased with further increasing electrolysis time this trend is consistent with the changes of easa of the nades during h2o2 electroproduction in the ca containing solutions table 3 and can be possibly explained by the water intrusion and ensuing accumulation of caco3 deposits at the tpi nevertheless the rct of nades used in the selected wastewater fluctuated considerably and exhibited no clear changing trends during h2o2 electroproduction possibly due to the more complex effects of wastewater constituents on nade properties iii during h2o2 electroproduction in the synthetic solutions and wastewater the cad and rad of nades increased relative to that of the virgin nade these increases can be possibly attributed to the decrease of hydrophobicity of the nades by adsorbed organics and or deposited minerals which increases the resistance of oxygen adsorption at the tpi iv by acid washing to remove caco3 scale from the nades both the rs and rct of the nades were decreased this finding suggests that the accumulation of caco3 in a major cause for the increased solution resistance and electron transfer resistance during h2o2 electroproduction in the ca containing solutions and selected wastewater 3 4 effects of mineral precipitates on nade stability for h2o2 electroproduction based on this information presented above a simplified scheme is proposed to illustrate the deterioration process of nade stability during h2o2 electroproduction in ca containing water matrices fig 5 due to the superaerophilicity of carbon ptfe composite the virgin nade retains a gas film at the electrode surface when it is immersed into the water si fig s4 therefore only limited triple phase points exist at the microscopically rugged nade surface see fig s2b and fig 5c xia et al 2021 upon cathodic polarization during h2o2 electroproduction water intrudes into the pores of carbon ptfe composite because of the electrocapillary effect fig 5d as a result a tpi among the gas water and electrode is generated in the nade pores at the tpi o2 h and e react together to yield h2o2 which then desorbs from the orr sites and diffuses into the solution as the final product fig 5d simultaneous with h2o2 electroproduction co2 and oh react with ca2 and mg2 to form caco3 and mg oh 2 precipitates on the surface and in the pores of the nade due to the electrocapillary effect and the decrease of nade hydrophobicity by caco3 precipitates water intrudes progressively into the depth of the nade during h2o2 electroproduction fig 5e along with the water intrusion increasing caco3 precipitates are generated on the surface and in the pores of nade the accumulation of caco3 precipitates on the nade can negatively influence orr to h2o2 in several ways firstly caco3 precipitates may cover the orr sites at the tpi thus impeding the h2o2 production process fig 5d moreover the deposition of caco3 precipitates reduces the pore size and may even block the entrance of some small pores inside the nade thus impeding h diffusion to the tpi murawski et al 2021 meanwhile the mineral deposits decrease the hydrophobicity of the nade which is unfavorable for oxygen adsorption and h2o2 desorption at the tpi consequently further reduction of the electro produced h2o2 to h2o may be promoted at the tpi furthermore the decrease of nade hydrophobicity also increases the chance of h2o2 being adsorbed and reduced at the nade pore walls when h2o2 diffuses through the nade channels to the bulk solution see fig 5e due to these reasons the ace of h2o2 production decreased during the multi cycle experiments conducted in the ca containing solutions and selected wastewater fig 2 acid wash can effectively remove mineral precipitates and thus largely restore the porosity and hydrophobicity of nades see table 2 hence the ace of h2o2 production could be temporarily restored by acid wash see fig 2 however because some mineral nucleus may remain in the nade pores after acid wash fig 5f which can accelerate the re growth of mineral crystals the ace of h2o2 production then decreased quickly again as the acid washed nade is reused in the ca containing solutions fig 2 3 5 practical implications overall the results presented above demonstrate that under relevant conditions of water and wastewater treatment e g ca2 concentrations of 92 7 200 mg l considerable amounts of caco3 precipitates can be formed on the nades during a short period of h2o2 electroproduction e g 60 h the accumulation of caco3 in nade pores can considerably change the nade properties and negatively influence the orr process in several ways consequently aces of h2o2 production decreased substantially during h2o2 electroproduction in ca containing water matrices although acid wash can temporarily restore the performance of the nades for h2o2 electroproduction the performance will deteriorate again quickly when the nades are continuously used in the ca containing water matrices moreover the generation of acid washing effluent is undesired in practical applications especially in decentralized water treatment systems where low maintenance operation is desired besides ca2 and mg2 some organic constituents in real water matrix e g surfactants may also cause electrode fouling and affect h2o2 electroproduction these results suggest that in practical applications directly producing h2o2 with nades in the water matrix that contains significant electrode fouling constituents e g ca2 and mg2 is possibly problematic from the perspective of long term stable operations to maintain stable h2o2 electroproduction with the nades during practical water and wastewater treatment several strategies may be taken to mitigate electrode fouling for example when the water matrix that needs to be treated contains high concentrations of ca2 and mg2 pretreatment such as lime soda softening and ion exchange may be used to remove these cations before h2o2 electroproduction with the nades alternatively a relatively clean water source e g tap water with low ca2 mg2 and dom contents may be used to produce high concentration h2o2 solutions in a separate electrochemical reactor with nades the concentrated h2o2 solution can then be fed to the water matrix that needs to be treated by h2o2 based aops such as fenton o3 h2o2 and uv h2o2 process dobelle et al 2021 li et al 2021b xia et al 2020 4 conclusions water constituents commonly present in real water matrices especially ca2 can cause serious electrode fouling and thus deteriorate the stability of nades during h2o2 electroproduction in water and wastewater treatment during h2o2 electroproduction ca2 can form significant amounts of caco3 precipitates on the surface and in the pores of nades the caco3 precipitates can block the active sites of orr imped h and electron transfer and affect oxygen adsorption and h2o2 desorption involved in orr to h2o2 moreover the caco3 precipitates decreased the hydrophobicity of the nades which promotes the side reaction of h2o2 reduction due to these effects the current efficiency of h2o2 production decreased continuously during electrolysis with the nades in the ca containing water matrices overall the results of this study indicate that the water matrix has a significant effect on the stability of nades for h2o2 electroproduction during water and wastewater treatment the good stability of nades observed in synthetic electrolyte solutions cannot be indiscriminately projected for real water matrix for stable h2o2 electroproduction over long term operations proper strategies are needed to mitigate the fouling of nades by the water constituents during water and wastewater treatment declaration of

15276,in sewer physio biochemical processes cause significant variations of wastewater quality during conveyance which affects the influent to a wastewater treatment plant wwtp and arguably the microbial community of biological treatment units in a wwtp in wet weather contaminants stored in sewer deposits can be resuspended and migrate downstream or be released during combined sewer overflows to the urban water bodies posing challenges to the treatment facilities or endangering urban water quality therefore in sewer transformation and migration of contaminants have been extensively studied the compiled results from representative research in the past few decades showed that biochemical reactions are both cross sectionally and longitudinally organized in the deposits and the sewage following the redox potential as well as the sequence of macromolecule contaminant degradation the sewage organic contents and sewer biofilm microorganisms were found to covary but more systematic studies are required to examine the temporal stability of the feature besides unique communities can be developed in the sewage phase the enrichment of the major sewage associated microorganisms can be explained by the availability of biodegradable organic contents in sewers the sewer deposits including biofilms harbor both microorganisms and contaminants and usually can provide longer residence time for in sewer transformation than wastewater however the interrelationships among contaminant transformation microorganisms in the deposits biofilms and those in the sewage are largely unclear specifically the formation and migration of fog fat oil and grease deposits generation and transport of contaminants in the sewer atmosphere e g h2s ch4 volatile organic compounds bioaerosols transport and transformation of nonconventional contaminants such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products and wastewater quality variation during the biofilm rehabilitation period after damages caused by rains storms are some topics for future research moreover systematic and standardized field analysis of real sewers under dynamic wastewater discharge conditions is necessary we believe that an improved understanding of these processes would assist in sewer management and better prepare us for the challenges brought about by climate change and water shortage

transport wastewater fig 1 a to a wastewater treatment plant wwtp so that the spread of pollutants and water borne diseases can be prevented under the diurnal pattern of municipal wastewater discharge i e one morning peak and two evening peaks late night and midday minima of the volumetric flow rate the median average residence time of wastewater in sewers is a few hours kapo et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 although relatively short both the amount and nature of wastewater components vary during conveyance due to in sewer processes like dilution physical deposition biochemical transformation and migration jin et al 2018 jin et al 2015b li et al 2021 mohanakrishnan et al 2009b nielsen et al 1992 shi et al 2018a therefore sewers also function as passive physio biochemical reactors sanitary wastewater or sewage primarily comprises domestic wastewater fig 1b and sometimes a proportion of commercial and industrial wastewater in combined sewers of many cities stormwater and runoff carrying street pollutants are conveyed together with sanitary wastewater the substances discharged to municipal sewers are usually regulated for example municipalities in the usa and canada have their own sewer use rules and regulations or bylaws according to the laws and guidance at the federal government level the us federal water pollution control act e g 40 cfr 405 471 and the model sewer use bylaw guidance from the canadian council of ministers of the environment respectively in china a national standard for wastewater discharged to municipal sewers was implemented in 2015 gb t31962 2015 noticeably wastewater quality variation inside sewer systems is often not regulated or monitored except for combined sewer overflow cso or sanitary sewer overflow sso e g 40 cfr 122 21 j 8 40 cfr 125 63 c 40 cfr 125 67 by the us federal government the council directive 91 271 eec by the european union according to the aforementioned laws and regulations the water quality parameters can be

is noteworthy that some emerging pollutants such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps are currently not specified in sewer use regulations bylaws but represent a part of organic pollutants additionally the microorganisms in sewers originated from human fecal microbes and those brought in during wet weather mclellan et al 2010 and evolved into a distinct microbial community lamartina et al 2021 mclellan and roguet 2019 can be included as a biological parameter the in sewer variation of wastewater quality is of interest because the changes affect the quality of wwtp influent fig 1c as well as the quality of urban water systems both the physiochemical characteristics botturi et al 2021 ravndal et al 2018 and arguably the microbial community structures guo et al 2021 lee et al 2015 sun et al 2022 some of the noticeable transformations of sewage organic content include a substantial reduction of easily biodegradable organics and the hydrolysis of organic matter including dissolved particulate and colloidal content during conveyance hvitved jacobsen et al 2002a jin et al 2015b consequently in dry weather the soluble and colloidal organic matter accounts for a tiny fraction of the wwtp influent while the hydrolytic products dominate ravndal et al 2018 transformation and degradation occur in both sewage and sewer deposits jin et al 2015b mohanakrishnan et al 2009b sun et al 2014 physical deposition in gravity sewers causes the trap of particulate matter organic and inorganic i e metals nitrogen and phosphorus in sewer deposits liu et al 2016 shi et al 2018a the organics buried in the deposit tend to decompose causing the release of odorous compounds and greenhouse gases jin et al 2019 liu et al 2016 short et al 2017 for combined sewers with open access to the ground increased flow during a storm can resuspend the deposits and if cso fig 1d occurs contaminants inside sewers can migrate to the urban water system banasiak et al 2005 shi et al 2018a many aspects of the in sewer physio biochemical processes that are responsible for wastewater quality variation during conveyance have been previously researched nonetheless knowledge gaps still exist in the changes of both organic and inorganic sewage contents along a sewer the development and evolution of sewer deposits the generation and transport of pollutants in sewer gases and the functions of microorganisms in the causation of these mentioned variations this review summarized the research progresses on wastewater quality variation in sewers and the interaction with deposits in combined and sanitary sewers discussed the characteristics of microorganisms involved in these processes and finally pinpointed potential research directions 2 variation of conventional contaminants in sewage 2 1 cod variation and major in sewer processes 2 1 1 overview field and pilot studies showed that approximately 6 32 of the sewage tcod total cod can be lost during conveyance table 1 due to processes including the physical deposition cod down mainly gravity sewers degradation of easily biodegradable components cod down an increase of microbial cells cod up and hydrolysis in bulk wastewater no cod change fig 2 a for pressure force mains the loss of tcod could be mainly attributed to the growth of biofilm and the generation of oxidizable volatile gaseous compounds such as h2s and ch4 the drop of tcod often leads to a lower carbon nitrogen c n ratio while the impact on wwtp caused by the decreased c n ratio is to be evaluated besides the size distribution of cod components shifts during conveyance for example the examination of a 1200 m long pilot gravity sewer fed with wwtp influent showed that the decomposition of organic molecules with a molecular weight of 10 000 da and within 650 10 000 da µm to mm range mainly hydrolysis and fermentation coincided with an increase in vfas and other fermentation products fig 2d jin et al 2015b occurred along the whole sewer jin et al 2018 jin et al 2015b fig 3 a analyses of vfa components in a sewershed 13 km2 with 37 km of sewers showed non detectable vfas in the front of the branch and main sewers and increased but generally low individual vfas components 10 mg l with acetate as the dominant vfa jin et al 2019 from the perspective of wwtp operation the anoxic and anaerobic transformations especially the generation and consumption of vfas should be monitored because the availability of vfas is crucial for the enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr technique in the downstream wwtp yun et al 2013 however relevant studies are still scarce overall the development of biochemical reactions is spatiotemporally dynamic fig 2a c leaving both temporal and longitudinal cross sectional distribution of aerobic anoxic and anaerobic zones 2 1 2 carbohydrates and proteinaceous substances carbohydrates are a major cod fraction in wastewater soluble and particulate carbohydrates together account for 25 50 of the total sewage organic matter von sperling 2007 the largest fractions of particulate organics 100 µm to 1 mm and larger in sewage often contain carbohydrates potentially cellulose derived from toilet paper residues ravndal et al 2018 soluble carbohydrate is a key component of the rapidly biodegradable organic content fig 1c which is mainly responsible for the decline of tcod during conveyance jin et al 2015b fig 3b in sewer degradation of soluble carbohydrates is relatively fast zero order or first order kinetics while the degradation of their particulate counterpart requires more time nielsen et al 1992 raunkjær et al 1995 tanaka and hvitved jacobsen 2001 for particulate and colloidal carbohydrates depolymerization catalyzed by carbohydrate active enzymes cazymes generated by heterotrophic microorganisms is often the first and also a rate limiting step wilkens et al 2017 zan et al 2020 following the hydrolysis and glycolysis of carbohydrates which occur in both aerobic and anaerobic conditions nielsen et al 1992 the subsequent biodegradation can occur in either anaerobic or aerobic conditions fig 2b another major cod fraction is proteinaceous substance which usually accounts for 16 28 of sewage cod ravndal et al 2018 or approximately 40 60 of the total organic compounds coulibaly et al 2002 von sperling 2007 precipitation of particulate proteins and microbial aggregates with soluble proteins adsorbed on them often causes a decrease of proteinaceous content in the front of a sewer system leaving mainly colloidal and polymeric forms of proteinaceous materials in wastewater guellil et al 2001 jin et al 2019 fig 3b the long term observation of a full scale sewer system 37 km long covering 13 km2 showed that the content of both carbohydrates and proteinaceous materials dropped approximately 77 to over 90 in the first 50 m of the branch sewers jin et al 2019 analysis of the corresponding sewer deposits demonstrated that carbohydrates were mainly decomposed in the wastewater while deposition was mainly responsible for the decrease of proteinaceous materials mass concentration ratio of deposit to wastewater approximately 8 52 jin et al 2019 for the residual proteinaceous substances in wastewater pilot scale and field studies showed that the degradation is slower than that of soluble carbohydrates raunkjær et al 1995 zhao et al 2019 probably due to the low hydrolysis rate for these particulate proteins trapped in deposits the overall degradation may also be limited because anaerobic degradation in sewer deposits often causes acidification dimock and morgenroth 2006 guillen jimenez et al 2000 ristenpart 1995 which impedes further hydrolysis of proteins by proteases duong et al 2019 meanwhile in gravity sewers the growth of microorganisms sometimes causes an increase in particulate protein content nielsen et al 1992 2 1 3 fat oil and grease fog usually accounts for 10 30 of sewage organic content coulibaly et al 2002 van gaelen et al 2021 ranging from 40 mg l to 2000 mg l or even higher metcalf and eddy inc 2013 williams et al 2012 fog are produced during food preparation in households and catering establishments hydrolysis catalyzed by microbial lipase enzymes is considered the major reaction that fog undergo in sewers franke et al 2011 he et al 2013 the hydrolysis yields long chain fatty acids and glycerol oleic acid c18 1 and palmitic acid c16 are two of the common long chain fatty acids from fog hydrolysis the generated fatty acids can be degraded following the β oxidation cycle sousa et al 2007 the glycerol can be converted to acetate h2 and bicarbonate by acetogens and srb sulfate reducing bacteria dinkel et al 2010 as substrates in methanogenesis it is noticeable that fog hydrolysis in a sewer is usually faster than the rate of product degradation because the latter usually requires syntrophic interactions between bacteria and hydrogenotrophic acetoclastic methanogens sousa et al 2007 thus free fatty acids ffa often accumulate in sewers besides unsaturated fatty acids are prone to be transformed into saturated fatty acids by microorganisms for instance oleic acid to palmitic acid pereira et al 2002 williams et al 2012 in sewers ffa from hydrolysis as well as these originated from cooking bazina and he 2018 van gaelen et al 2021 then participate in saponification reaction with minerals mainly calcium ions and form fog deposits he et al 2011 keener et al 2008 fig 4 analysis of fog deposits showed that saturated fatty acids content mainly palmitic acid is 61 3 26 5 ave std while unsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids account for 22 3 18 3 and 4 4 6 8 respectively keener et al 2008 fog deposits tend to be accumulated in sewer systems keener et al 2008 currently the source of calcium in fog deposit is not definite and several possibilities exist fig 4 some reported a lack of a positive relationship between water hardness and the calcium content in fog deposits keener et al 2008 while some show the opposite williams et al 2012 calcium from corroded concrete infrastructures was proposed to explain the discrepancy he et al 2011 but fog deposits collected from plastic and iron branch sewers have been shown to contain more calcium nieuwenhuis et al 2018 statistical analyses showed that more than a third of all branch sewer failures in the netherlands nieuwenhuis et al 2018 and 50 75 of the sewer overflows in the usa keener et al 2008 kusum et al 2020 are attributable to fog deposits however the efficient and accurate detection of in sewer fog deposits still poses challenges to sewer management and congestion overflow prevention jiang et al 2021 2 1 4 gaseous products with reducing power and greenhouse effect in addition to these cod fractions in sewage and the deposits some volatile gaseous substances can pass the liquid gas interface e g in gravity sewers and enter the sewer headspace especially under turbulent flow at spots like the drops guo et al 2018 hvitved jacobsen et al 2002b pandey et al 2016 wang et al 2013 sulfate reduction fermentation and methanogenesis are some of the major processes that generate volatile gaseous products jin et al 2019 fig 2b the partition of these reduced compounds to the sewer atmosphere represents a loss of sewage cod but is likely not as significant as biochemical degradation and physical deposition in the liquid and solid phases for instance solely the loss of ch4 from gravity sewers was estimated to be 62 g ch4 person year 248 g person year as o2 demand short et al 2017 which is approximately 2 6 of total cod loss assuming 25 of cod reduction of domestic wastewater during conveyance e g bod 16 425 g person year and cod 32 485 to 45 120 g person year gray and becker 2002 kumokawa et al 2019 it is noteworthy that sewer systems installing septic tanks between branch and collector sewers may release more ch4 diaz valbuena et al 2011 however relevant information is insufficient for a rough estimation regarding h2s another common oxidizable sewer gas field observation from a pressure main showed that the generated h2s accounted for an average of 2 8 min max 0 8 6 7 of the total organic carbon loss hvitved jacobsen et al 1995 it is noteworthy that gas exchange or ventilation between the atmosphere and the sewer headspace via openings e g manholes with perforated covers can lead to pollutant emission to the atmosphere as well as oxygen intrusion to the sewer headspace for example high speed of outward ventilation from manholes over 40 m s was detected qian et al 2021 besides inward ventilation was shown to positively correlate with the rate of h2s oxidation in sewage nielsen et al 2012 which yields sulfate and supports the oxidation of downstream organics gutierrez et al 2008 further reducing the cod overall sewer gas transport is a complex phenomenon that is controlled by multiple processes such as water drag and turbulence induced by pumping or drops the above estimation of either ch4 or h2s did not consider the gas phase loss during conveyance in sewers and thus the true gas phase loss of cod should be larger and need to be adjusted in the future 2 2 variation of total nitrogen and total phosphorus sources of nitrogen in sewage include the discharged protein urine and other nitrogen compounds from households industrial and commercial sources ravndal et al 2018 shi et al 2018b nitrogenous components in wwtp influent comprise approximately 75 ammonium 7 5 readily biodegradable hydrolyzable 2 5 slowly hydrolyzable 14 biomass n and some inert residues henze 1992 nitrogen is typically quantified by the total nitrogen tn and the total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn including organic nitrogen and ammonium nitrate if present usually is in low concentration because it is readily denitrified during conveyance urea from urine is the major source of nitrogen in sewage urine is responsible for approximately 80 of the tn 71 of the potassium and 47 of the tp total phosphorus in sewage larsen et al 2013 udert et al 2006 urea is usually rich in branch sewers over 30 mg l and readily decomposes by urea hydrolyzing bacteria or enzymes yielding ammonium and bicarbonate for instance in the aforementioned field survey of the 37 km long gravity sewer system over 87 of urea decomposed in the first 50 m in the branch sewers jin et al 2019 the decomposition of urea tends to increase the sewage ph to approximately 9 consequently sewage ph generally follows the diurnal variation of wastewater containing urine discharge showing one morning peak and one evening peak sharma et al 2013 wuang et al 2013 spatially the ph tends to be high 8 5 9 near the front of a sewer where urea decomposition dominates and slightly drops in downstream still above 7 houhou et al 2009a by the time the sewage reaches a wwtp urea concentration often drops to a low level or below the detection limit zhao et al 2019 in contrast the ammonium from urea hydrolysis and other biological reactions is usually conservative and sometimes even shows an increasing trend been et al 2014 gray and becker 2002 pai et al 2013 partly due to its high pka 9 4 observation from a gravity sewer in portugal 7240 m 0 7 slope shows that the loss of total ammonium in sewers is approximately 6 almeida et al 2000 final ammonium concentration is often 40 60 mg n l in the wwtp influent metcalf and eddy inc 2013 in a wwtp influent primarily originating from municipal wastewater inorganic phosphorus mostly orthophosphate accounts for 60 70 of tp in wastewater chen et al 2020 organic phosphorus in a wwtp influent is often dominated by compounds such as phosphate monoesters phospholipids and phosphate diesters with biological origin ravndal et al 2018 wang et al 2022 pilot studies using wwtp influents showed that the tp varied little during conveyance jin et al 2015a jin and wang 2016 indicating a relatively stable phosphorus composition after potential transformation in the full scale sewer little is known about the variation of phosphorus in actual sewer systems regarding the inorganic phosphorus partition to sewer deposit may be a major sink especially after the initial dilution of urine by other waste streams which induces the precipitation of insoluble amorphous ca phosphate and al ca phosphate e g hydroxyapatite ca5 po4 3 oh houhou et al 2009a udert et al 2003 however the mass distribution of phosphorus in sewer systems including those deposited in sewer sediment and those that migrate in wastewater is unknown therefore the storage and transformation of these insoluble phosphate minerals in sewer sediment are worth further research as they may affect the phosphorus recovery inside a wwtp additionally the variation of organic phosphorus in sewer systems is largely unknown according to the conceptual framework based on a pilot gravity sewer fed by wwtp influent phosphorus in the wastewater phase is subjected to dynamic processes including deposition adsorption to suspended biomass followed by biotransformation and release from sewer deposit due to organic phosphorus decomposition liu et al 2022 shi et al 2018b overall the extent of the inorganic and organic phosphorus turnover during conveyance is to be investigated besides the interaction between the calcium consuming fog deposit formation and the precipitation of insoluble phosphate minerals e g hydroxyapatite is also of interest from the perspective of fog deposit control 3 variation of organic contaminants 3 1 organic contaminants partition to sewer gas the rules and bylaws mentioned earlier all regulate the discharge of organic compounds to sewer systems including chloroform toluene phenolic compounds and benzene like compounds such as chlorobenzene many of these often have low to moderate solubility in wastewater and thus can transfer to the sewer headspace direct discharge and in sewer transformation are two of the main sources of these compounds in sewage for instance chloroform and other trihalomethanes commonly reported ones include dichlorobromomethane dibromochloromethane and bromoform enter sewers as disinfection by products that are originally present in tap water besides chloroform can also be released into sewers from industrial sources such as pulp and paper mills and chemical manufacturing plants trichloroethylene tce and tetrachloroethylene pce if detected in sewer gas mainly originate from industrial degreasing operations gasperi et al 2012 additionally infiltration of tce contaminated groundwater into aged sewer systems can also lead to detectable tce in sewage and sewer gas roghani et al 2018 another representative volatile organic compound voc commonly detected in sewer gas is methyl mercaptan also known as methanethiol the us epa has declared methanethiol a regulated toxic substance due to its adverse effects on human health discharge of wastewater with dimethyl sulfoxide residue from industrial sources and biodegradation of methionine from the degradation of proteinaceous materials can all result in dimethyl sulfide dms which can be further transformed to methanethiol by hyphomicrobium arthrobacter species that synthesize dms monooxygenase schäfer and eyice 2019 disturbance of wastewater at drop structures can induce significant partition or stripping of vocs to sewer gas for example as much as 29 44 removal of individual vocs from wastewater was detected in two consecutive drop structures along an interceptor sewer in toronto quigley and corsi 1995 as such in addition to the aforementioned h2s ch4 and vfas sewer gas often contains chlorinated hydrocarbons organic sulfur compounds methanethiol and dms aldehydes mainly butyraldehyde etc hvitved jacobsen et al 2002b pandey et al 2016 wang et al 2013 currently discrete topics of research regarding the vocs in sewer systems are available but our knowledge of vocs emission and transportation along a sewer is limited most research still focuses on the detection of gaseous organic pollutants in sewers or the control of odorous compounds emitted into the atmosphere via outward ventilation from sewers major challenges arise from difficulties in quantifying voc emissions specifically in addition to the complexity brought in by non point sources significant variability has been detected with different sampling methods among which passive sampling is usually superior to grab sampling because the former assists in decreasing temporal variability in voc concentrations haas and herrmann 1998 spatial distribution of voc levels can be revealed by passive sampling or a continuous monitoring device in a sewer system roghani et al 2018 similarly temporal variation of volatile sewer compound concentrations can be revealed by sampling at various timescales sivret et al 2017 however both the development of voc treatment techniques and control strategies require further interpretation of these voc concentrations which needs to be paired with the detailed sewer gas ventilation information i e volumetric flow rate and flow direction currently systematic concentration measurement that incorporates ventilation monitoring is missing regarding the ventilation of a sewer system the accurate determination of in sewer gas movement is complicated by the hydraulic conditions pitiriciu and tansel 2021 as well as the inward and outward exchange or vertical exchange between the atmosphere and sewer gas nielsen et al 2012 qian et al 2018 due to the pressure difference caused by gas exchange in vertical directions gaseous contaminants also transport horizontally along a sewer on average the horizontal sewer gas flow rate is 0 35 times of wastewater flow rate qian et al 2021 and the gas generally moves in the same direction as wastewater parker and ryan 2001 but can also experience the gas hammer effect matos et al 2019 some studies have attempted to track volatile compounds based on the analysis of horizontal gas movement guo et al 2018 madsen et al 2006 however most of these studies were motivated by the concern over infrastructure corrosion induced by h2s global warming caused by ch4 and co2 and odorous complaints jin et al 2019 matos et al 2019 pikaar et al 2019 since the combined horizontal transport and vertical exchange with the atmosphere may affect the air quality of urban areas the emissions of volatile sewer gas warrant more systematic research 3 2 organic contaminants in sewage and sewer deposits 3 2 1 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and polychlorinated biphenyls polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs and polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs are two groups of representative organic pollutants that are regulated in sewer systems for example the us federal water pollution control act i e 40 cfr 423 appendix a listed 16 of the pahs as priority pollutants pahs belong to total petroleum hydrocarbons tph which are commonly detected in combined sewer deposits jiménez et al 2004 rocher et al 2004a rocher et al 2004b source identification showed that pyrogenic pahs were dominant in the sewer sediment in paris rocher et al 2004b which corroborated the observation that run off in wet weather is a main source of pahs in combined sewers because these of pyrolytic origin first is emitted to the atmosphere zheng et al 2014 almost all pahs in sewer systems approximately 90 are bound to particulates and thus migrate with suspended particles or sewer sediment gasperi et al 2006 heavy molecular weight pahs usually comprise the majority of the pahs in sewer deposits accounting for approximately 80 of the total rocher et al 2004a the transformation of pahs in sewers may be limited as field analyses showed no significant spatial variation of pah component distribution along a sewer in a full scale sewer network dry or wet weather gasperi et al 2006 rocher et al 2004b pcbs are often considered legacy pollutants because their production has been banned in many countries since the 1970s gasperi et al 2012 krumins et al 2018 however sewer systems still accept pcbs from historical discharges and ongoing permitted uses jing et al 2019 similar to pahs pcbs also tend to adsorb to suspended particles microbial aggregates in wastewater and accumulate in the deposit phase rodenburg et al 2010 currently available evidence suggests that pcbs undergo dechlorination in sewer systems rodenburg et al 2012 since dechlorination requires anaerobic conditions the transformation probably occurred in sewer sediment or even the sewer biofilms refer to section 5 2 1 for deposit stratification the detection of putative organohalide respiring bacteria in sewer sediment supported the occurrence of dechlorination krumins et al 2018 although dechlorination can occur in a sewer environment the spatiotemporal characteristics of the reduction reactions and the microorganisms involved are largely unknown h2 and acetate have been reported to serve as the electron and carbon sources respectively for the typical obligate organohalide respiring bacteria dehalococcoides mccartyi during pcb metabolism laroe et al 2014 hence the fermentation of carbohydrates and other major cod components should be essential in providing these dechlorinating reactants if dechlorination coincides with fermentative h2 production sufficient reducing power may be available for organohalide respiring bacteria however studies of such interactions are scarce additionally both anaerobic e g in stratified deposits after prolonged dry weather and aerobic conditions e g at drops or manholes exist in sewer systems which might induce not only dechlorination of heavily chlorinated pcbs but also aerobic oxidation of the less chlorinated pcb congeners which was shown to facilitate pcbs mineralization in controlled bioreactors pathiraja et al 2019 however whether pcbs in sewers undergo such transformation is largely unknown such in depth examination of pcb dechlorination and potential interference of the process may help leverage the passive degradation capability of sewer systems alleviating the burden of downstream wwtps 3 2 2 pharmaceuticals personal care products and illicit drugs currently ppcps and illicit drugs are not explicitly listed in the aforementioned regulations and bylaws because available knowledge and techniques are not sufficient to address these substances in sewers besides the risk posed by ppcps and illicit drugs to ecosystems is not clear hence they are currently being treated as emerging contaminants e g commission implementing decision european union 2018 840 the fate and transformation of ppcps in sewers attracted attention because ppcps were found to be accumulated in the tissues of aquatic creatures in water bodies that receive wwtp effluent de solla et al 2016 therefore ppcps are recalcitrant to conventional wwt processes and csos containing ppcps may endanger the urban surface water ecosystems little is known about the in sewer biotransformation and transport of pharmaceuticals such as the active pharmaceutical ingredients apis and new psychoactive substances been et al 2014 li et al 2019a partly due to their much lower concentrations in sewage often at ng l levels bade et al 2017 only some commonly used apis such as antibiotics hypertension drugs and analgesics may exist at mg l lindberg et al 2014 many studies showed that pharmaceuticals drugs undergo a negligible or limited transformation in sewers or their concentrations fluctuated without a clear trend jelic et al 2015 lindberg et al 2014 shi et al 2022b for these showing detectable changes chemical hydrolysis biodegradation and sorption to solids have all been speculated to play a role hajj mohamad et al 2017 lindberg et al 2014 o brien et al 2017 ramin et al 2017 ren et al 2021 on the other hand the conversion of the conjugates or desorption from sewer sediment may increase the concentrations of some pharmaceutical compounds in sewage jelic et al 2015 li et al 2019a the concern over the development of antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and the spread of antibiotic resistant genes arg in sewage and sewer deposits that contain ppcps such as triclosan is an emerging field of research eramo et al 2020 morales medina et al 2022 however research on the variation and distribution of arg and arb in sewers is still scarce the sewage in some countries also contains illicit drugs cocaine cannabis and amphetamine methamphetamine are some of the common analytes as reviewed by mccall et al most studies on the in sewer transformation of illicit drug residues were based on injection tests mccall et al 2016 rather than close monitoring of the drugs along a sewer the biotransformation and stability of illicit drugs in a sewer environment might be compound dependent li et al 2019a thai et al 2014 biotic hydrolysis conjugation and deconjugation are some of the possible biochemical pathways mccall et al 2016 sorption to suspended solids was generally regarded as insignificant for illicit drugs li et al 2020 spiking tests in containers suggest that illicit drugs tend to be degraded more in aerobic conditions as opposed to anaerobic conditions ramin et al 2016 potentially a reason for their limited transformation during conveyance 4 variation of inorganic contaminants and bioaerosols heavy metals and bioaerosols are some of the known but less studied sewer contaminants as compared to the organic and biological sewage fractions heavy metals are the major regulated inorganic pollutants in sewer systems most of the heavy metals entering sewers partition to the sewer deposits approximately 67 82 michelbach and wöhrle 1992 early studies showed that heavy metals were mainly stored in sewer deposits at the invert gasperi et al 2010 rocher et al 2004a as carbonate compounds sulfide compounds and metal alloys in a recent study heavy metals in sewer deposits were found to be positively correlated with the organic matter petroleum oil tp and sulfide content of deposits luo et al 2021 suggesting that complexation by organics and precipitation are two main sinks of heavy metals besides sewer heavy metals sometimes bind to iron oxides hydroxides houhou et al 2009b although no single pattern can be drawn for all the heavy metal ions they tend to accumulate more as fine particles in the deposits houhou et al 2009b for instance a recent fractionation study showed that fine particles 1 75 µm carry more heavy metals zn cu cr and cd than coarser particles 1000 4750 µm in sewers xu et al 2018 while metal alloys and metal sulfides are less likely to participate in biochemical reactions the fraction associated with organic content can be affected rudd et al 1984 for example aeration was shown to induce heavy metal release from sewer deposits at do 5 mg l the release of zn cu pb and cr greatly increased li et al 2013 and both abiotic and biotic oxidation may be responsible recent studies showed that inhalation exposure to ebolavirus contaminated aerosols from sewers is also a non negligible issue haas et al 2017 which is understandable considering the well known bacteria fungi laden aerosols from wwtps bauer et al 2002 with an ongoing coronavirus pandemic and detection of sars cov 2 severe acute respiratory syndrome associated coronavirus 2 in wastewater samples as reported elsewhere bogler et al 2020 la rosa et al 2020 the generation of bioaerosols carrying pathogens the viability of the pathogens in aerosols and the infectivity risk of these aerosols during wastewater conveyance are some of the emerging topics of research foladori et al 2020 for example recent laboratory tests with bioreactors showed that the abundance of sars cov 2 declines significantly in sewer environments shi et al 2022a although no evidence suggests that sars cov 2 can be transmitted via exposure to bioaerosols from sewer systems a previous study of the viral infectivity of sars cov 2 in aerosols showed that it can last for approximately 1 1 h van doremalen et al 2020 and transmission via building plumbing has been documented for sars cov 1 hung 2003 more field and laboratory investigations are needed to shed light on this issue 5 synergistic interactions with sewer deposits 5 1 overview of sewer deposits and interfacial processes the gravity sewers combined or separate are designed to convey several times the anticipated peak dry weather sewage thus the sewer system normally works at low capacity and in sewer deposits 30 to 500 g m day are common ashley et al 2005 ashley et al 2004a the term deposit is used here instead of sediment to describe the insoluble substances abiotic and biotic that accumulate on the inner surface of sewer pipes the main body of deposits at sewer invert usually contains 20 40 of water and less than 10 of organics hajj mohamad et al 2017 luo et al 2021 grabtree categorized the sewer deposits into five types table 2 fig 5 a crabtree 1989 type a deposits are mostly coarse mineral granules probably originating from solid particles on the urban ground surfaces in contrast type d deposits or the slimes developed around the average sewage level often harbor microorganisms in pressure mains type d deposits are the slime or biofilm that covers the inner surface of sewer pipes fig 5a the type c deposit organic layer is rich in organics e g 66 75 of volatile suspended solids out of total suspended solids ahyerre et al 2001a and constitutes the main source of pollutants during csos particulate organic matter and particulate minerals or biological aggregates with adsorbed contaminants soluble and colloidal 10 3 1 µm are some sources of type c deposits ashley et al 2004b bunch and griffin 1992 lab scale study field analysis and modeling provided us with much insight into the formation and properties of sewer deposits which are often loaded with pollutants botturi et al 2021 murali et al 2020 regueiro picallo et al 2017 shi et al 2018a sun et al 2014 however much of the identified research needs for sewer deposits by ashley et al almost two decades ago are still to be investigated ashley et al 2005 some of the known characteristics of sewer deposits are summarized here the longitudinal distribution pattern of type c and a deposits i e the so called sewer sediment in gravity sewers is usually relatively stable while the erosion of deposits can lead to a dramatic change in deposition depth michelbach and wöhrle 1992 verbanck 1990 fig 5c in contrast no information about the distribution of type d deposits in pressure mains is available since the depth profiles fig 5c were measured over seven months the distribution pattern indicates that the structure of a sewer is the determining factor in deposit accumulation flow variation in wet weather can induce erosion of deposits banasiak et al 2005 in addition the release of gaseous products such as ch4 can loose the structure of deposits e g type a and d and leave them vulnerable to erosion banasiak et al 2005 vollertsen and hvitved jacobsen 2000 anaerobic methanogenesis foley et al 2009 and aerobic degradation of cod chen and leung 2000 are some common biochemical reactions in deposits supported by the bidirectional transport of essential nutrients and metabolites between wastewater and deposit fig 5b the aforementioned volatile compounds sections 2 1 3 1 other than these from discharges largely originated from the deposits overall two pairs of processes exist at the liquid solid interface fig 2a i e ① adsorption deposition and resuspension detachment physical deposition and release caused by physical disturbance such as cso fig 2a dashed lines ② uptake and excretion migration and consumption by microorganisms and the release of transformed contaminants back to the wastewater shi et al 2018a shi et al 2018b 5 2 processes in sewer deposits 5 2 1 without odorous compound control the density of microorganisms in deposits is often higher than that in sewage for instance the biological activity in the deposits of a well aerated gravity sewer 2 6 mg doc mg dry wt day was found to be superior to suspended solids 0 6 mg doc mg ss day chen et al 2001 the direct our oxygen utilization rate analysis also corroborated this phenomenon huisman et al 2004 the consequences of these biochemical reactions include ① the stabilization of a deposit marked by a lower organic content regueiro picallo et al 2018 ristenpart 1995 and ② the deposit stratification from the perspective of either organic mineral content fig 5a gravity sewer or microbial metabolic pathway redox potential fig 5b both gravity and pressure sewers for instance the our of microorganisms in type c deposit is often several times of that in the underlying type a deposit vollertsen and hvitved jacobsen 2000 while microorganisms deeper in the deposit e g type a deposit are usually more active than those in the top deposit in terms of h2s and ch4 generation hvitved jacobsen 2001 liu et al 2015 shi et al 2018a fig 5b this shift from aerobic to anaerobic condition has also been observed in thick type d deposits okabe et al 2003 sun et al 2014 furthermore the top layer of type c deposits is often mobile called fluid sediment ahyerre et al 2001a at a speed that is much slower than the bulk sewage verbanck 1990 however the detailed effect of the physical movement of these deposits is unclear analysis of sewer deposits in full scale combined sewers showed that the physical parameters of sewer deposits including ph bulk density and particle size distribution were relatively stable while the chemical composition including the content of hazardous and emerging pollutants exhibits little spatial consistence luo et al 2021 petrie 2021 nevertheless in the longitudinal direction along a continuous section of sewer e g between two drops microbial metabolism in deposits is often arranged in sequence for an established gravity sewer 1500 m 0 75 slope the specific our of microorganisms in deposits decreased along the sewer chen and leung 2000 similarly a declining trend of co2 generation during conveyance was observed in a gravity sewer system 37 km jin et al 2019 indicating a gradually declined aerobic degradation potential analysis of a full scale pressure main showed that srb were more abundant and diverse near the front than in the end section and this distinct pattern in srb coincided with the varying capacities of h2s and vfas generation mohanakrishnan et al 2009b interestingly methanogenesis activity in pressure mains was relatively stable along the sewer and final dissolved ch4 was mainly controlled by the residence time with higher production at longer residence time foley et al 2009 the often more abundant readily degradable nutrients in deposits near the head of a sewer system may be a reason although some patterns are relatively consistent in different studies information on the longitudinal contaminant transformation distribution in sewer deposits is still meager the higher microbial activity near the front of a sewer as shown both here and in section 2 1 suggests that easily biodegradable components in wastewater are largely consumed early during conveyance simply deducing from the density or activity of microorganisms sewer deposits should be responsible for most of the biological activity these biochemical processes cause the shift to anaerobic conditions which facilitates fermentation and generation of vfas relatively low orp 100 mv is required for vfa generation yin et al 2016 and pilot studies suggest that such condition is achievable in type d and a deposits in a gravity sewer usually not in wastewater shi et al 2018a zan et al 2019 hence fermentation in deposits could be the main source of wastewater vfas the gradually increased and then plateaued vfas jin et al 2019 and the sewer length dependent vfa content in wwtp influents yun et al 2013 observed in full scale sewers can then be partly explained by the development of the anaerobic condition and fermentative reactions in deposits along the sewers 5 2 2 with odorous compound control addition of exogenous oxidants e g o2 and nitrate is a common practice to control the release of odorous contaminants e g h2s chlorinated hydrocarbons from sewers which are mainly generated in the deposits hvitved jacobsen et al 2002b pandey et al 2016 wang et al 2013 h2s is the most notorious target since it usually coexists with other odorous compounds oxidants either divert the electron donors for srb to other biochemical reactions e g aerobic oxidation or oxidize the dissolved sulfide e g autotrophic denitrification jiang et al 2013 yang et al 2021 methanogenesis is often inhibited as a side effect because methanogens prefer low redox potential the commonly applied oxidant nitrate has been shown to induce further decline of wastewater cod firer et al 2008 liang et al 2016 mohanakrishnan et al 2009a the influence of a decreasing c n ratio upon denitrification and an increased nitrate level in wastewater on wwtp are still some topics to be investigated additionally the ph elevation through shock treatment with sodium magnesium hydroxide ganigue et al 2011 and dosage of iron firer et al 2008 zhang et al 2009 are some other techniques for odorous contaminant control however the effects on the wastewater quality variation are not clear despite the unclear feedback from the wwt processes these odor control practices may affect the fate of some pollutants in sewer deposits especially heavy metals it can be inferred that some heavy metals can precipitate as metal sulfides in the presence of h2s the inhibited sulfide formation and the oxidation of sulfide pan et al 2022 may shift the heavy metals to more reactive or mobile forms moreover gaseous products such as ch4 have been shown to form cavities inside deposits and leave the sediment vulnerable to hydraulic erosion banasiak et al 2005 vollertsen and hvitved jacobsen 2000 the influence of odor control over the generation of gaseous products in biofilms and type a deposits and the induced changes to the cohesion of deposits warrant further investigation because deposits in combined sewers may be released during wet weather as discussed in the next section eventually the benefits of odor control practices must be weighed against the potential disadvantages to wastewater management both in sewers and the wwtps 5 3 wet weather flow and combined sewer overflow it is a common notion that wastewater quality variation mainly depends on the hydraulic residence time hrt in a sewer augustyniak et al 2021 however the reviewed literature here suggests that pollutant transfer across interfaces complicates the situation figs 2a 5b and hrt is only one of the many factors that affect wastewater quality pollutants can partition into deposits and then be released back into wastewater depending on the hydraulics of wastewater or whether the critical shear stress for the threshold of motion is reached banasiak et al 2005 at low shear stress pollutants stored in deposits can experience long solids residence time in contrast when the wastewater flow rate is high enough and exceeds the critical shear stress deposited pollutants are mobilized and re enter the wastewater the previous discussion is relevant to combined sewers in dry weather and separate sanitary sewers during wet weather wastewater and the associated pollutants in combined sewers are subject to dilution and migration in runoff events the stormwater often accounts for 69 95 of the combined flow petrie 2021 and the combined flow can cause a substantial loss of contaminants from a sewer to the urban water system munro et al 2019 vandewalle et al 2012 for example the load of various hormones in one cso event can be 43 99 of the annual load in a wwtp phillips et al 2012 a source identification study showed that 57 80 of the tkn in the combined flow was from the sewers gasperi et al 2010 overall up to 80 of the contaminant load in overflows can be attributed to deposit erosion ahyerre et al 2000 2001a gasperi et al 2010 as for organic contaminants the release of pahs stored in deposits gasperi et al 2010 and desorbed high molecular weight pharmaceuticals hajj mohamad et al 2017 are two examples regarding heavy metals cu cr and cd were found to be released from sewer deposits during csos forming a significant fraction of the suspended particles el samrani et al 2008 xu et al 2018 aside from these associated with sewer organic matter metal sulfide is a major form of many heavy metals in csos el samrani et al 2004 the erosion of a stabilized deposit by stormwater usually begins with the top deposit type c ahyerre et al 2000 which occurs at low shear stress 0 5 n m2 ahyerre et al 2001b the destabilization of this organic rich deposit explains the high biodegradability of the initial overflow sakrabani et al 2009 the biodegradability eventually declines when the mixed flow picks up the resuspended type a deposits and runoff from the ground so far studies on wastewater and cso discharge in wet weather often focus on contaminants release source identification and cso treatment ahyerre et al 2001b botturi et al 2021 gromaire et al 2001 petrie 2021 the in sewer wastewater quality variation during and after rains storms is a less studied topic during a mild rain degradation of soluble cod may be enhanced because of the resuspended deposit biofilm leung et al 2005 sakrabani et al 2009 however the capability of organics degradation by a substantially disturbed deposit i e without biofilm can drop significantly vollertsen and hvitved jacobsen 2000 besides a considerable amount of deposit can migrate with mixed sewage and runoff upon hydraulic erosion fig 5c however the difference between water quality variation in dry weather and that after wet weather with disturbed deposits is rarely reported with currently available knowledge it seems that sewer biofilm can form in a few days michelbach and wöhrle 1992 but lab scale sedimentation tests and field observations indicate that consolidation of sediment can take 20 days to approximately two months ahyerre et al 2000 ristenpart 1995 a considerable amount of wastewater can flow through a sewer system during this rehabilitation period and thus the pattern of wastewater quality variation as well as the development of the microbial communities in sewage is crucial for both sewer management and downstream wastewater treatment 6 microbes and sewers the powerhouse of biodegradation and the incubator 6 1 overview sewer microorganisms are responsible for most of the previously mentioned biochemical reactions a sewer system is a special niche where distinct microbial communities dissimilar to human fecal bacteria can form lamartina et al 2021 mclellan and roguet 2019 the microbial community within a combined sewer is affected by both human fecal microbes and those brought in by rainwater stormwater mclellan et al 2010 while those in pressure sewers are mainly affected by the microbes in sewage as mentioned in section 5 2 a significant number of microorganisms inhabit sewer deposits prolonging their residence time in sewers the exact residence time of microorganisms and pollutants in sewer deposits is case dependent and often unknown nevertheless according to the time required for microbiological consolidation of deposits and the dechlorination of organohalides laroe et al 2014 ristenpart 1995 the residence time of both organic pollutants such as pcbs and microorganisms in sewer deposits in dry weather can be on the order of weeks or even longer this residence time is much longer than the doubling time of common heterotrophic microorganisms and obligately organohalide respiring bacteria which usually ranges from hours up to a few days löffler et al 2013 therefore deposits partly act as an incubator for functional microorganisms some other factors also influence the in sewer microbial community for instance the nitrate dosed for odor control encouraged the growth of autotrophic denitrifiers mohanakrishnan et al 2009a the microbial structure and composition in sewers are of high interest because they often determine the transformation of contaminants and thus the variation of wastewater quality along a sewer liu et al 2019 besides microbial activity in deposits also influences the cohesion of structure meng et al 2020 meng et al 2019 additionally microbes in sewers seem to be related to the microbial communities downstream in wwtps dottorini et al 2021 guo et al 2021 lamartina et al 2021 nevertheless currently available studies rarely couple the in sewer processes and deposit erosion characteristics with the variation of microbial communities therefore gaps in the knowledge of the interactions among in sewer biological activity contaminant transformation and sedimentation erosion still exist 6 2 suspended microorganisms in sewage the microbial communities in sewage were shown to be dominated by acinetobacter aeromonas and trichococcus species from lactococcus and enterobacteriaceae tend to be enriched vandewalle et al 2012 the in sewer processes must have favored the growth of these species because they were nearly absent in human fecal samples for instance acinetobacter and arcobacter might be enriched during the degradation of calcium palmitate i e fog deposit in aerobic conditions or involved in denitrification he et al 2015 while lactococcus and enterobacteriaceae species are enriched for sugar fermentation batt 2014 trichococcus species are known lactate fermenters interestingly physically separated sewers in the same catchment can develop highly similar microbial communities vandewalle et al 2012 fig 6 the resemblance in microbial communities among different sewage influents has also been reported elsewhere lamartina et al 2021 additionally the sewage bacterial community exhibited seasonal or temperature dependent variation lamartina et al 2021 6 3 sessile microorganisms in deposits currently available information pertinent to microorganisms in sewer deposits mainly the biofilm is mostly about the major in sewer biochemical reactions such as hydrolysis and fermentation with an emphasis on srb and methanogens chen and leung 2000 vollertsen and hvitved jacobsen 2000 zan et al 2019 functional microorganisms specialized in metabolizing organohalides and emerging pollutants are rarely reported krumins et al 2018 since details about sewer biofilms have been recently reviewed elsewhere augustyniak et al 2021 li et al 2019b only the often neglected spatial distribution of microbial communities of sewer biofilm is briefly discussed here to the best of our knowledge no study examined the variation of biofilm microorganisms along a full scale gravity pressure sewer investigation on a pilot scale gravity sewer showed that the dominant bacterial phyla were generally stable including proteobacteria 33 83 bacteroidetes 10 29 and firmicutes 2 17 but the exact microbial composition varied along the sewer jin et al 2018 it seems that hydrolytic and fermentative microorganisms e g trichococcus and cloacibacterium were most active in the middle section of the sewer and their contents decreased after 800 m jin et al 2018 besides hydrogen producing acetogens e g veillonella and anaerolinea and srb e g desulfovibrio and desulfonema followed a similar trend but denitrifiers showed a continuously decreasing trend along the sewer fig 7 a these trends are in line with the active decomposition of particulate and macromolecules early during conveyance as discussed in section 2 1 the detection of trichococcus species in sewer biofilm echoes the idea that biofilm type c and d deposits serves as an incubator for functional microorganisms and also suggests that detached biofilm is a source of planktonic microorganisms in wastewater regarding the srb and methanogens available lab scale and pilot studies indicate that their activities are mostly confined to type d c and a deposits chen et al 2021 guisasola et al 2008 liu et al 2016 shi et al 2018a vollertsen and hvitved jacobsen 2000 the analysis of their spatial distribution along a sewer potentially may facilitate the control of h2s and ch4 emission however whether the srb follow a specific pattern of distribution along a gravity sewer is unclear in contrast methanogens have been demonstrated to vary based on substrate availability along a gravity sewer fig 7b jin et al 2018 to date little is known about the longitudinal dynamics of the biofilm microbial community in pressure mains in addition to the case mentioned in section 5 2 1 mohanakrishnan et al 2009b kiilerich et al found that microbial community structure along their pilot pressure main varied in both species diversity and taxa distribution fig 8 kiilerich et al 2019 overall the species diversity dropped from 0 to 200 m and genera like cloacibacillus anaerovorax and fusibacter were dominant at the end of the pilot sewer kiilerich et al 2019 regarding methanogens controversial discoveries were reported mohanakrishnan et al found a greater number of acetoclastic methanogens near the front and more hydrogenotrophic methanogens near the end mohanakrishnan et al 2009b while kiilerich et al found that both hydrogenotrophic methanogens and acetoclastic methanogens were enriched close to the end of the sewer kiilerich et al 2019 the difference in sewer length might play a role but further research is necessary to examine the spatial distribution pattern of both srb and methanogens 7 discussion currently the fundamental role of sewer systems i e wastewater conveyance still did not change although the literature reviewed here suggests that in sewer reactions transformation and transportation can exert influences on the wastewater quality which in turn might affect the management of wwtps the in sewer physiochemical processes are usually not under control and it is also impractical to run sewers as bioreactors for pollutant treatment however the knowledge gained on the in sewer processes such as the changes of cod loss of organic pollutants to the sewer atmosphere and transformation of certain inorganic and organic pollutants can inform us about ① accumulation and distribution pattern of inorganic e g heavy metals and organic e g organohalides along a sewer so that periodic sewer cleaning or site specific treatment can be administered to reduce the effect of csos ② the variation of wastewater quality which allows us to take precautionary measures in wwtps for a stable treatment performance ③ the release pattern of potentially hazardous volatile compounds and bioaerosols to densely populated urban areas providing necessary information that allows us to reduce or eliminate the health effect of inhalable pollutants fig 9 accordingly two major groups of directions for future sewer research are proposed here 7 1 more emphasis on nonconventional contaminants these major cod bod components have been targets of sewer studies for several decades now to date the in sewer degradation pathways of these easily biodegradable compounds are relatively well known in contrast the migration and transformation of those gaseous pollutants emerging contaminants and more recalcitrant organic pollutants are less known but the fate of these compounds is of interest considering their significant influence on the environment and human health some major topics to be researched include control and treatment of vocs and greenhouse gases emitted from sewer systems based on improved knowledge of in sewer deposition and sewer gas ventilation transport and transformation of ppcps in sewer deposits and the concurrent variation of arg and arb in sewers interactions between the transformation of common cod components such as carbohydrates and the degradation of pcbs in sewer deposits 7 2 validation of conclusions extrapolated from bench scale and pilot studies bench scale bioreactors and pilot sewer systems have all been reported as simulating platforms in past sewer studies liu et al 2015 however caution should be taken while extrapolating conclusions gained in these studies to full scale sewers as mentioned in section 2 pilot scale gravity sewers fed by wwtp influents cannot reveal the fast degradation of carbohydrates or the precipitation of proteinaceous materials in branch sewers this deficiency also exists in the study of phosphorus regarding these bioreactors with and without filling materials for biofilm attachment only generic biofilm processes can be inferred hence the results from a laboratory study need to be paired with analyses of a real sewer which is often missing some topics to be considered include standardization of field sampling protocols that cover different levels of sewers i e branch collector trunk and interceptor sewers while taking the varying hydraulic condition inside sewers into account odor and bioaerosol control strategy development based on an improved understanding of sewer gas ventilation and the gas exchange between the atmosphere and the sewer wastewater quality fluctuation during sewer deposit rehabilitation after the disturbance caused by csos on the other hand sewer systems in modern urban areas usually cover a large area thus even a study of one individual interceptor sewer can be challenging to overcome this problem robots and sensors can be deployed robots can help collect samples without breaking a sewer line while sensors can be planted in a sewer system and function in both dry and wet weather saving manpower and effort by providing real time information on key water quality parameters 8 conclusions variations of wastewater quality in sewers resulted from complex physio biochemical processes although knowledge gaps still exist in many aspects of in sewer processes research in the past suggests that many of these processes are spatiotemporally organized and some of them demonstrate relatively consistent patterns especially the covariation of contaminants and biofilm microorganisms along a continuous sewer section with diverse and contrasting patterns of urbanization around the world and challenges from climate change sewerage management needs to be improved in terms of reduced cso impact decreased greenhouse gas emissions controlled odor and bioaerosols release etc to achieve these objectives better comprehension of in sewer processes is necessary which would eventually assist in improving the downstream wwtp performance because sewers partly act as a pre treatment unit credit authorship contribution statement yaohuan gao

15276,in sewer physio biochemical processes cause significant variations of wastewater quality during conveyance which affects the influent to a wastewater treatment plant wwtp and arguably the microbial community of biological treatment units in a wwtp in wet weather contaminants stored in sewer deposits can be resuspended and migrate downstream or be released during combined sewer overflows to the urban water bodies posing challenges to the treatment facilities or endangering urban water quality therefore in sewer transformation and migration of contaminants have been extensively studied the compiled results from representative research in the past few decades showed that biochemical reactions are both cross sectionally and longitudinally organized in the deposits and the sewage following the redox potential as well as the sequence of macromolecule contaminant degradation the sewage organic contents and sewer biofilm microorganisms were found to covary but more systematic studies are required to examine the temporal stability of the feature besides unique communities can be developed in the sewage phase the enrichment of the major sewage associated microorganisms can be explained by the availability of biodegradable organic contents in sewers the sewer deposits including biofilms harbor both microorganisms and contaminants and usually can provide longer residence time for in sewer transformation than wastewater however the interrelationships among contaminant transformation microorganisms in the deposits biofilms and those in the sewage are largely unclear specifically the formation and migration of fog fat oil and grease deposits generation and transport of contaminants in the sewer atmosphere e g h2s ch4 volatile organic compounds bioaerosols transport and transformation of nonconventional contaminants such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products and wastewater quality variation during the biofilm rehabilitation period after damages caused by rains storms are some topics for future research moreover systematic and standardized field analysis of real sewers under dynamic wastewater discharge conditions is necessary we believe that an improved understanding of these processes would assist in sewer management and better prepare us for the challenges brought about by climate change and water shortage

transport wastewater fig 1 a to a wastewater treatment plant wwtp so that the spread of pollutants and water borne diseases can be prevented under the diurnal pattern of municipal wastewater discharge i e one morning peak and two evening peaks late night and midday minima of the volumetric flow rate the median average residence time of wastewater in sewers is a few hours kapo et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 although relatively short both the amount and nature of wastewater components vary during conveyance due to in sewer processes like dilution physical deposition biochemical transformation and migration jin et al 2018 jin et al 2015b li et al 2021 mohanakrishnan et al 2009b nielsen et al 1992 shi et al 2018a therefore sewers also function as passive physio biochemical reactors sanitary wastewater or sewage primarily comprises domestic wastewater fig 1b and sometimes a proportion of commercial and industrial wastewater in combined sewers of many cities stormwater and runoff carrying street pollutants are conveyed together with sanitary wastewater the substances discharged to municipal sewers are usually regulated for example municipalities in the usa and canada have their own sewer use rules and regulations or bylaws according to the laws and guidance at the federal government level the us federal water pollution control act e g 40 cfr 405 471 and the model sewer use bylaw guidance from the canadian council of ministers of the environment respectively in china a national standard for wastewater discharged to municipal sewers was implemented in 2015 gb t31962 2015 noticeably wastewater quality variation inside sewer systems is often not regulated or monitored except for combined sewer overflow cso or sanitary sewer overflow sso e g 40 cfr 122 21 j 8 40 cfr 125 63 c 40 cfr 125 67 by the us federal government the council directive 91 271 eec by the european union according to the aforementioned laws and regulations the water quality parameters can be categorized as ① conventional contaminants and physical parameters e g chemical biological oxygen demand cod bod ph temperature total suspended solids fog fat oil and grease that includes mineral and synthetic hydrocarbon ② organic contaminants e g phenolic compounds polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs chloroform dichlorobenzene nitrobenzene and ③ inorganic contaminants e g heavy metals total nitrogen total phosphorus the organic pollutants can be further broken down into subgroups including readily degradable e g volatile fatty acids vfas formaldehyde persistent organic pollutants e g pcbs etc it is noteworthy that some emerging pollutants such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps are currently not specified in sewer use regulations bylaws but represent a part of organic pollutants additionally the microorganisms in sewers originated from human fecal microbes and those brought in during wet weather mclellan et al 2010 and evolved into a distinct microbial community lamartina et al 2021 mclellan and roguet 2019 can be included as a biological parameter the in sewer variation of wastewater quality is of interest because the changes affect the quality of wwtp influent fig 1c as well as the quality of urban water systems both the physiochemical characteristics botturi et al 2021 ravndal et al 2018 and arguably the microbial community structures guo et al 2021 lee et al 2015 sun et al 2022 some of the noticeable transformations of sewage organic content include a substantial reduction of easily biodegradable organics and the hydrolysis of organic matter including dissolved particulate and colloidal content during conveyance hvitved jacobsen et al 2002a jin et al 2015b consequently in dry weather the soluble and colloidal organic matter accounts for a tiny fraction of the wwtp influent while the hydrolytic products dominate ravndal et al 2018 transformation and degradation occur in both sewage and sewer deposits jin et al 2015b mohanakrishnan et al 2009b sun et al 2014 physical deposition in gravity sewers causes the trap of particulate matter organic and inorganic i e metals nitrogen and phosphorus in sewer deposits liu et al 2016 shi et al 2018a the organics buried in the deposit tend to decompose causing the release of odorous compounds and greenhouse gases jin et al 2019 liu et al 2016 short et al 2017 for combined sewers with open access to the ground increased flow during a storm can resuspend the deposits and if cso fig 1d occurs contaminants inside sewers can migrate to the urban water system banasiak et al 2005 shi et al 2018a many aspects of the in sewer physio biochemical processes that are responsible for wastewater quality variation during conveyance have been previously researched nonetheless knowledge gaps still exist in the changes of both organic and inorganic sewage contents along a sewer the development and evolution of sewer deposits the generation and transport of pollutants in sewer gases and the functions of microorganisms in the causation of these mentioned variations this review summarized the research progresses on wastewater quality variation in sewers and the interaction with deposits in combined and sanitary sewers discussed the characteristics of microorganisms involved in these processes and finally pinpointed potential research directions 2 variation of conventional contaminants in sewage 2 1 cod variation and major in sewer processes 2 1 1 overview field and pilot studies showed that approximately 6 32 of the sewage tcod total cod can be lost during conveyance table 1 due to processes including the physical deposition cod down mainly gravity sewers degradation of easily biodegradable components cod down an increase of microbial cells cod up and hydrolysis in bulk wastewater no cod change fig 2 a for pressure force mains the loss of tcod could be mainly attributed to the growth of biofilm and the generation of oxidizable volatile gaseous compounds such as h2s and ch4 the drop of tcod often leads to a lower carbon nitrogen c n ratio while the impact on wwtp caused by the decreased c n ratio is to be evaluated besides the size distribution of cod components shifts during conveyance for example the examination of a 1200 m long pilot gravity sewer fed with wwtp influent showed that the decomposition of organic molecules with a molecular weight of 10 000 da and within 650 10 000 da µm to mm range mainly hydrolysis and fermentation coincided with an increase in vfas and other fermentation products fig 2d jin et al 2015b occurred along the whole sewer jin et al 2018 jin et al 2015b fig 3 a analyses of vfa components in a sewershed 13 km2 with 37 km of sewers showed non detectable vfas in the front of the branch and main sewers and increased but generally low individual vfas components 10 mg l with acetate as the dominant vfa jin et al 2019 from the perspective of wwtp operation the anoxic and anaerobic transformations especially the generation and consumption of vfas should be monitored because the availability of vfas is crucial for the enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr technique in the downstream wwtp yun et al 2013 however relevant studies are still scarce overall the development of biochemical reactions is spatiotemporally dynamic fig 2a c leaving both temporal and longitudinal cross sectional distribution of aerobic anoxic and anaerobic zones 2 1 2 carbohydrates and proteinaceous substances carbohydrates are a major cod fraction in wastewater soluble and particulate carbohydrates together account for 25 50 of the total sewage organic matter von sperling 2007 the largest fractions of particulate organics 100 µm to 1 mm and larger in sewage often contain carbohydrates potentially cellulose derived from toilet paper residues ravndal et al 2018 soluble carbohydrate is a key component of the rapidly biodegradable organic content fig 1c which is mainly responsible for the decline of tcod during conveyance jin et al 2015b fig 3b in sewer degradation of soluble carbohydrates is relatively fast zero order or first order kinetics while the degradation of their particulate counterpart requires more time nielsen et al 1992 raunkjær et al 1995 tanaka and hvitved jacobsen 2001 for particulate and colloidal carbohydrates depolymerization catalyzed by carbohydrate active enzymes cazymes generated by heterotrophic microorganisms is often the first and also a rate limiting step wilkens et al 2017 zan et al 2020 following the hydrolysis and glycolysis of carbohydrates which occur in both aerobic and anaerobic conditions nielsen et al 1992 the subsequent biodegradation can occur in either anaerobic or aerobic conditions fig 2b another major cod fraction is proteinaceous substance which usually accounts for 16 28 of sewage cod ravndal et al 2018 or approximately 40 60 of the total organic compounds coulibaly et al 2002 von sperling 2007 precipitation of particulate proteins and microbial aggregates with soluble proteins adsorbed on them often causes a decrease of proteinaceous content in the front of a sewer system leaving mainly colloidal and polymeric forms of proteinaceous materials in wastewater guellil et al 2001 jin et al 2019 fig 3b the long term observation of a full scale sewer system 37 km long covering 13 km2 showed that the content of both carbohydrates and proteinaceous materials dropped approximately 77 to over 90 in the first 50 m of the branch sewers jin et al 2019 analysis of the corresponding sewer deposits demonstrated that carbohydrates were mainly decomposed in the wastewater while deposition was mainly responsible for the decrease of proteinaceous materials mass concentration ratio of deposit to wastewater approximately 8 52 jin et al 2019 for the residual proteinaceous substances in wastewater pilot scale and field studies showed that the degradation is slower than that of soluble carbohydrates raunkjær et al 1995 zhao et al 2019 probably due to the low hydrolysis rate for these particulate proteins trapped in deposits the overall degradation may also be limited because anaerobic degradation in sewer deposits often causes acidification dimock and morgenroth 2006 guillen jimenez et al 2000 ristenpart 1995 which impedes further hydrolysis of proteins by proteases duong et al 2019 meanwhile in gravity sewers the growth of microorganisms sometimes causes an increase in particulate protein content nielsen et al 1992 2 1 3 fat oil and grease fog usually accounts for 10 30 of sewage organic content coulibaly et al 2002 van gaelen et al 2021 ranging from 40 mg l to 2000 mg l or even higher metcalf and eddy inc 2013 williams et al 2012 fog are produced during food preparation in households and catering establishments hydrolysis catalyzed by microbial lipase enzymes is considered the major reaction that fog undergo in sewers franke et al 2011 he et al 2013 the hydrolysis yields long chain fatty acids and glycerol oleic acid c18 1 and palmitic acid c16 are two of the common long chain fatty acids from fog hydrolysis the generated fatty acids can be degraded following the β oxidation cycle sousa et al 2007 the glycerol can be converted to acetate h2 and bicarbonate by acetogens and srb sulfate reducing bacteria dinkel et al 2010 as substrates in methanogenesis it is noticeable that fog hydrolysis in a sewer is usually faster than the rate of product degradation because the latter usually requires syntrophic interactions between bacteria and hydrogenotrophic acetoclastic methanogens sousa et al 2007 thus free fatty acids ffa often accumulate in sewers besides unsaturated fatty acids are prone to be transformed into saturated fatty acids by microorganisms for instance oleic acid to palmitic acid pereira et al 2002 williams et al 2012 in sewers ffa from hydrolysis as well as these originated from cooking bazina and he 2018 van gaelen et al 2021 then participate in saponification reaction with minerals mainly calcium ions and form fog deposits he et al 2011 keener et al 2008 fig 4 analysis of fog deposits showed that saturated fatty acids content mainly palmitic acid is 61 3 26 5 ave std while unsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids account for 22 3 18 3 and 4 4 6 8 respectively keener et al 2008 fog deposits tend to be accumulated in sewer systems keener et al 2008 currently the source of calcium in fog deposit is not definite and several possibilities exist fig 4 some reported a lack of a positive relationship between water hardness and the calcium content in fog deposits keener et al 2008 while some show the opposite williams et al 2012 calcium from corroded concrete infrastructures was proposed to explain the discrepancy he et al 2011 but fog deposits collected from plastic and iron branch sewers have been shown to contain more calcium nieuwenhuis et al 2018 statistical analyses showed that more than a third of all branch sewer failures in the netherlands nieuwenhuis et al 2018 and 50 75 of the sewer overflows in the usa keener et al 2008 kusum et al 2020 are attributable to fog deposits however the efficient and accurate detection of in sewer fog deposits still poses challenges to sewer management and congestion overflow prevention jiang et al 2021 2 1 4 gaseous products with reducing power and greenhouse effect in addition to these cod fractions in sewage and the deposits some volatile gaseous substances can pass the liquid gas interface e g in gravity sewers and enter the sewer headspace especially under turbulent flow at spots like the drops guo et al 2018 hvitved jacobsen et al 2002b pandey et al 2016 wang et al 2013 sulfate reduction fermentation and methanogenesis are some of the major processes that generate volatile gaseous products jin et al 2019 fig 2b the partition of these reduced compounds to the sewer atmosphere represents a loss of sewage cod but is likely not as significant as biochemical degradation and physical deposition in the liquid and solid phases for instance solely the loss of ch4 from gravity sewers was estimated to be 62 g ch4 person year 248 g person year as o2 demand short et al 2017 which is approximately 2 6 of total cod loss assuming 25 of cod reduction of domestic wastewater during conveyance e g bod 16 425 g person year and cod 32 485 to 45 120 g person year gray and becker 2002 kumokawa et al 2019 it is noteworthy that sewer systems installing septic tanks between branch and collector sewers may release more ch4 diaz valbuena et al 2011 however relevant information is insufficient for a rough estimation regarding h2s another common oxidizable sewer gas field observation from a pressure main showed that the generated h2s accounted for an average of 2 8 min max 0 8 6 7 of the total organic carbon loss hvitved jacobsen et al 1995 it is noteworthy that gas exchange or ventilation between the atmosphere and the sewer headspace via openings e g manholes with perforated covers can lead to pollutant emission to the atmosphere as well as oxygen intrusion to the sewer headspace for example high speed of outward ventilation from manholes over 40 m s was detected qian et al 2021 besides inward ventilation was shown to positively correlate with the rate of h2s oxidation in sewage nielsen et al 2012 which yields sulfate and supports the oxidation of downstream organics gutierrez et al 2008 further reducing the cod overall sewer gas transport is a complex phenomenon that is controlled by multiple processes such as water drag and turbulence induced by pumping or drops the above estimation of either ch4 or h2s did not consider the gas phase loss during conveyance in sewers and thus the true gas phase loss of cod should be larger and need to be adjusted in the future 2 2 variation of total nitrogen and total phosphorus sources of nitrogen in sewage include the discharged protein urine and other nitrogen compounds from households industrial and commercial sources ravndal et al 2018 shi et al 2018b nitrogenous components in wwtp influent comprise approximately 75 ammonium 7 5 readily biodegradable hydrolyzable 2 5 slowly hydrolyzable 14 biomass n and some inert residues henze 1992 nitrogen is typically quantified by the total nitrogen tn and the total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn including organic nitrogen and ammonium nitrate if present usually is in low concentration because it is readily denitrified during conveyance urea from urine is the major source of nitrogen in sewage urine is responsible for approximately 80 of the tn 71 of the potassium and 47 of the tp total phosphorus in sewage larsen et al 2013 udert et al 2006 urea is usually rich in branch sewers over 30 mg l and readily decomposes by urea hydrolyzing bacteria or enzymes yielding ammonium and bicarbonate for instance in the aforementioned field survey of the 37 km long gravity sewer system over 87 of urea decomposed in the first 50 m in the branch sewers jin et al 2019 the decomposition of urea tends to increase the sewage ph to approximately 9 consequently sewage ph generally follows the diurnal variation of wastewater containing urine discharge showing one morning peak and one evening peak sharma et al 2013 wuang et al 2013 spatially the ph tends to be high 8 5 9 near the front of a sewer where urea decomposition dominates and slightly drops in downstream still above 7 houhou et al 2009a by the time the sewage reaches a wwtp urea concentration often drops to a low level or below the detection limit zhao et al 2019 in contrast the ammonium from urea hydrolysis and other biological reactions is usually conservative and sometimes even shows an increasing trend been et al 2014 gray and becker 2002 pai et al 2013 partly due to its high pka 9 4 observation from a gravity sewer in portugal 7240 m 0 7 slope shows that the loss of total ammonium in sewers is approximately 6 almeida et al 2000 final ammonium concentration is often 40 60 mg n l in the wwtp influent metcalf and eddy inc 2013 in a wwtp influent primarily originating from municipal wastewater inorganic phosphorus mostly orthophosphate accounts for 60 70 of tp in wastewater chen et al 2020 organic phosphorus in a wwtp influent is often dominated by compounds such as phosphate monoesters phospholipids and phosphate diesters with biological origin ravndal et al 2018 wang et al 2022 pilot studies using wwtp influents showed that the tp varied little during conveyance jin et al 2015a jin and wang 2016 indicating a relatively stable phosphorus composition after potential transformation in the full scale sewer little is known about the variation of phosphorus in actual sewer systems regarding the inorganic phosphorus partition to sewer deposit may be a major sink especially after the initial dilution of urine by other waste streams which induces the precipitation of insoluble amorphous ca phosphate and al ca phosphate e g hydroxyapatite ca5 po4 3 oh houhou et al 2009a udert et al 2003 however the mass distribution of phosphorus in sewer systems including those deposited in sewer sediment and those that migrate in wastewater is unknown therefore the storage and transformation of these insoluble phosphate minerals in sewer sediment are worth further research as they may affect the phosphorus recovery inside a wwtp additionally the variation of organic phosphorus in sewer systems is largely unknown according to the conceptual framework based on a pilot gravity sewer fed by wwtp influent phosphorus in the wastewater phase is subjected to dynamic processes including deposition adsorption to suspended biomass followed by biotransformation and release from sewer deposit due to organic phosphorus decomposition liu et al 2022 shi et al 2018b overall the extent of the inorganic and organic phosphorus turnover during conveyance is to be investigated besides the interaction between the calcium consuming fog deposit formation and the precipitation of insoluble phosphate minerals e g hydroxyapatite is also of interest from the perspective of fog deposit control 3 variation of organic contaminants 3 1 organic contaminants partition to sewer gas the rules and bylaws mentioned earlier all regulate the discharge of organic compounds to sewer systems including chloroform toluene phenolic compounds and benzene like compounds such as chlorobenzene many of these often have low to moderate solubility in wastewater and thus can transfer to the sewer headspace direct discharge and in sewer transformation are two of the main sources of these compounds in sewage for instance chloroform and other trihalomethanes commonly reported ones include dichlorobromomethane dibromochloromethane and bromoform enter sewers as disinfection by products that are originally present in tap water besides chloroform can also be released into sewers from industrial sources such as pulp and paper mills and chemical manufacturing plants trichloroethylene tce and tetrachloroethylene pce if detected in sewer gas mainly originate from industrial degreasing operations gasperi et al 2012 additionally infiltration of tce contaminated groundwater into aged sewer systems can also lead to detectable tce in sewage and sewer gas roghani et al 2018 another representative volatile organic compound voc commonly detected in sewer gas is methyl mercaptan also known as methanethiol the us epa has declared methanethiol a regulated toxic substance due to its adverse effects on human health discharge of wastewater with dimethyl sulfoxide residue from industrial sources and biodegradation of methionine from the degradation of proteinaceous materials can all result in dimethyl sulfide dms which can be further transformed to methanethiol by hyphomicrobium arthrobacter species that synthesize dms monooxygenase schäfer and eyice 2019 disturbance of wastewater at drop structures can induce significant partition or stripping of vocs to sewer gas for example as much as 29 44 removal of individual vocs from wastewater was detected in two consecutive drop structures along an interceptor sewer in toronto quigley and corsi 1995 as such in addition to the aforementioned h2s ch4 and vfas sewer gas often contains chlorinated hydrocarbons organic sulfur compounds methanethiol and dms aldehydes mainly butyraldehyde etc hvitved jacobsen et al 2002b pandey et al 2016 wang et al 2013 currently discrete topics of research regarding the vocs in sewer systems are available but our knowledge of vocs emission and transportation along a sewer is limited most research still focuses on the detection of gaseous organic pollutants in sewers or the control of odorous compounds emitted into the atmosphere via outward ventilation from sewers major challenges arise from difficulties in quantifying voc emissions specifically in addition to the complexity brought in by non point sources significant variability has been detected with different sampling methods among which passive sampling is usually superior to grab sampling because the former assists in decreasing temporal variability in voc concentrations haas and herrmann 1998 spatial distribution of voc levels can be revealed by passive sampling or a continuous monitoring device in a sewer system roghani et al 2018 similarly temporal variation of volatile sewer compound concentrations can be revealed by sampling at various timescales sivret et al 2017 however both the development of voc treatment techniques and control strategies require further interpretation of these voc concentrations which needs to be paired with the detailed sewer gas ventilation information i e volumetric flow rate and flow direction currently systematic concentration measurement that incorporates ventilation monitoring is missing regarding the ventilation of a sewer system the accurate determination of in sewer gas movement is complicated by the hydraulic conditions pitiriciu and tansel 2021 as well as the inward and outward exchange or vertical exchange between the atmosphere and sewer gas nielsen et al 2012 qian et al 2018 due to the pressure difference caused by gas exchange in vertical directions gaseous contaminants also transport horizontally along a sewer on average the horizontal sewer gas flow rate is 0 35 times of wastewater flow rate qian et al 2021 and the gas generally moves in the same direction as wastewater parker and ryan 2001 but can also experience the gas hammer effect matos et al 2019 some studies have attempted to track volatile compounds based on the analysis of horizontal gas movement guo et al 2018 madsen et al 2006 however most of these studies were motivated by the concern over infrastructure corrosion induced by h2s global warming caused by ch4 and co2 and odorous complaints jin et al 2019 matos et al 2019 pikaar et al 2019 since the combined horizontal transport and vertical exchange with the atmosphere may affect the air quality of urban areas the emissions of volatile sewer gas warrant more systematic research 3 2 organic contaminants in sewage and sewer deposits 3 2 1 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and polychlorinated biphenyls polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs and polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs are two groups of representative organic pollutants that are regulated in sewer systems for example the us federal water pollution control act i e 40 cfr 423 appendix a listed 16 of the pahs as priority pollutants pahs belong to total petroleum hydrocarbons tph which are commonly detected in combined sewer deposits jiménez et al 2004 rocher et al 2004a rocher et al 2004b source identification showed that pyrogenic pahs were dominant in the sewer sediment in paris rocher et al 2004b which corroborated the observation that run off in wet weather is a main source of pahs in combined sewers because these of pyrolytic origin first is emitted to the atmosphere zheng et al 2014 almost all pahs in sewer systems approximately 90 are bound to particulates and thus migrate with suspended particles or sewer sediment gasperi et al 2006 heavy molecular weight pahs usually comprise the majority of the pahs in sewer deposits accounting for approximately 80 of the total rocher et al 2004a the transformation of pahs in sewers may be limited as field analyses showed no significant spatial variation of pah component distribution along a sewer in a full scale sewer network dry or wet weather gasperi et al 2006 rocher et al 2004b pcbs are often considered legacy pollutants because their production has been banned in many countries since the 1970s gasperi et al 2012 krumins et al 2018 however sewer systems still accept pcbs from historical discharges and ongoing permitted uses jing et al 2019 similar to pahs pcbs also tend to adsorb to suspended particles microbial aggregates in wastewater and accumulate in the deposit phase rodenburg et al 2010 currently available evidence suggests that pcbs undergo dechlorination in sewer systems rodenburg et al 2012 since dechlorination requires anaerobic conditions the transformation probably occurred in sewer sediment or even the sewer biofilms refer to section 5 2 1 for deposit stratification the detection of putative organohalide respiring bacteria in sewer sediment supported the occurrence of dechlorination krumins et al 2018 although dechlorination can occur in a sewer environment the spatiotemporal characteristics of the reduction reactions and the microorganisms involved are largely unknown h2 and acetate have been reported to serve as the electron and carbon sources respectively for the typical obligate organohalide respiring bacteria dehalococcoides mccartyi during pcb metabolism laroe et al 2014 hence the fermentation of carbohydrates and other major cod components should be essential in providing these dechlorinating reactants if dechlorination coincides with fermentative h2 production sufficient reducing power may be available for organohalide respiring bacteria however studies of such interactions are scarce additionally both anaerobic e g in stratified deposits after prolonged dry weather and aerobic conditions e g at drops or manholes exist in sewer systems which might induce not only dechlorination of heavily chlorinated pcbs but also aerobic oxidation of the less chlorinated pcb congeners which was shown to facilitate pcbs mineralization in controlled bioreactors pathiraja et al 2019 however whether pcbs in sewers undergo such transformation is largely unknown such in depth examination of pcb dechlorination and potential interference of the process may help leverage the passive degradation capability of sewer systems alleviating the burden of downstream wwtps 3 2 2 pharmaceuticals personal care products and illicit drugs currently ppcps and illicit drugs are not explicitly listed in the aforementioned regulations and bylaws because available knowledge and techniques are not sufficient to address these substances in sewers besides the risk posed by ppcps and illicit drugs to ecosystems is not clear hence they are currently being treated as emerging contaminants e g commission implementing decision european union 2018 840 the fate and transformation of ppcps in sewers attracted attention because ppcps were found to be accumulated in the tissues of aquatic creatures in water bodies that receive wwtp effluent de solla et al 2016 therefore ppcps are recalcitrant to conventional wwt processes and csos containing ppcps may endanger the urban surface water ecosystems little is known about the in sewer biotransformation and transport of pharmaceuticals such as the active pharmaceutical ingredients apis and new psychoactive substances been et al 2014 li et al 2019a partly due to their much lower concentrations in sewage often at ng l levels bade et al 2017 only some commonly used apis such as antibiotics hypertension drugs and analgesics may exist at mg l lindberg et al 2014 many studies showed that pharmaceuticals drugs undergo a negligible or limited transformation in sewers or their concentrations fluctuated without a clear trend jelic et al 2015 lindberg et al 2014 shi et al 2022b for these showing detectable changes chemical hydrolysis biodegradation and sorption to solids have all been speculated to play a role hajj mohamad et al 2017 lindberg et al 2014 o brien et al 2017 ramin et al 2017 ren et al 2021 on the other hand the conversion of the conjugates or desorption from sewer sediment may increase the concentrations of some pharmaceutical compounds in sewage jelic et al 2015 li et al 2019a the concern over the development of antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and the spread of antibiotic resistant genes arg in sewage and sewer deposits that contain ppcps such as triclosan is an emerging field of research eramo et al 2020 morales medina et al 2022 however research on the variation and distribution of arg and arb in sewers is still scarce the sewage in some countries also contains illicit drugs cocaine cannabis and amphetamine methamphetamine are some of the common analytes as reviewed by mccall et al most studies on the in sewer transformation of illicit drug residues were based on injection tests mccall et al 2016 rather than close monitoring of the drugs along a sewer the biotransformation and stability of illicit drugs in a sewer environment might be compound dependent li et al 2019a thai et al 2014 biotic hydrolysis conjugation and deconjugation are some of the possible biochemical pathways mccall et al 2016 sorption to suspended solids was generally regarded as insignificant for illicit drugs li et al 2020 spiking tests in containers suggest that illicit drugs tend to be degraded more in aerobic conditions as opposed to anaerobic conditions ramin et al 2016 potentially a reason for their limited transformation during conveyance 4 variation of inorganic contaminants and bioaerosols heavy metals and bioaerosols are some of the known but less studied sewer contaminants as compared to the organic and biological sewage fractions heavy metals are the major regulated inorganic pollutants in sewer systems most of the heavy metals entering sewers partition to the sewer deposits approximately 67 82 michelbach and wöhrle 1992 early studies showed that heavy metals were mainly stored in sewer deposits at the invert gasperi et al 2010 rocher et al 2004a as carbonate compounds sulfide compounds and metal alloys in a recent study heavy metals in sewer deposits were found to be positively correlated with the organic matter petroleum oil tp and sulfide content of deposits luo et al 2021 suggesting that complexation by organics and precipitation are two main sinks of heavy metals besides sewer heavy metals sometimes bind to iron oxides hydroxides houhou et al 2009b although no single pattern can be drawn for all the heavy metal ions they tend to accumulate more as fine particles in the deposits houhou et al 2009b for instance a recent fractionation study showed that fine particles 1 75 µm carry more heavy metals zn cu cr and cd than coarser particles 1000 4750 µm in sewers xu et al 2018 while metal alloys and metal sulfides are less likely to participate in biochemical reactions the fraction associated with organic content can be affected rudd et al 1984 for example aeration was shown to induce heavy metal release from sewer deposits at do 5 mg l the release of zn cu pb and cr greatly increased li et al 2013 and both abiotic and biotic oxidation may be responsible recent studies showed that inhalation exposure to ebolavirus contaminated aerosols from sewers is also a non negligible issue haas et al 2017 which is understandable considering the well known bacteria fungi laden aerosols from wwtps bauer et al 2002 with an ongoing coronavirus pandemic and detection of sars cov 2 severe acute respiratory syndrome associated coronavirus 2 in wastewater samples as reported elsewhere bogler et al 2020 la rosa et al 2020 the generation of bioaerosols carrying pathogens the viability of the pathogens in aerosols and the infectivity risk of these aerosols during wastewater conveyance are some of the emerging topics of research foladori et al 2020 for example recent laboratory tests with bioreactors showed that the abundance of sars cov 2 declines significantly in sewer environments shi et al 2022a although no evidence suggests that sars cov 2 can be transmitted via exposure to bioaerosols from sewer systems a previous study of the viral infectivity of sars cov 2 in aerosols showed that it can last for approximately 1 1 h van doremalen et al 2020 and transmission via building plumbing has been documented for sars cov 1 hung 2003 more field and laboratory investigations are needed to shed light on this issue 5 synergistic interactions with sewer deposits 5 1 overview of sewer deposits and interfacial processes the gravity sewers combined or separate are designed to convey several times the anticipated peak dry weather sewage thus the sewer system normally works at low capacity and in sewer deposits 30 to 500 g m day are common ashley et al 2005 ashley et al 2004a the term deposit is used here instead of sediment to describe the insoluble substances abiotic and biotic that accumulate on the inner surface of sewer pipes the main body of deposits at sewer invert usually contains 20 40 of water and less than 10 of organics hajj mohamad et al 2017 luo et al 2021 grabtree categorized the sewer deposits into five types table 2 fig 5 a crabtree 1989 type a deposits are mostly coarse mineral granules probably originating from solid particles on the urban ground surfaces in contrast type d deposits or the slimes developed around the average sewage level often harbor microorganisms in pressure mains type d deposits are the slime or biofilm that covers the inner surface of sewer pipes fig 5a the type c deposit organic layer is rich in organics e g 66 75 of volatile suspended solids out of total suspended solids ahyerre et al 2001a and constitutes the main source of pollutants during csos particulate organic matter and particulate minerals or biological aggregates with adsorbed contaminants soluble and colloidal 10 3 1 µm are some sources of type c deposits ashley et al 2004b bunch and griffin 1992 lab scale study field analysis and modeling provided us with much insight into the formation and properties of sewer deposits which are often loaded with pollutants botturi et al 2021 murali et al 2020 regueiro picallo et al 2017 shi et al 2018a sun et al 2014 however much of the identified research needs for sewer deposits by ashley et al almost two decades ago are still to be investigated ashley et al 2005 some of the known characteristics of sewer deposits are summarized here the longitudinal distribution pattern of type c and a deposits i e the so called sewer sediment in gravity sewers is usually relatively stable while the erosion of deposits can lead to a dramatic change in deposition depth michelbach and wöhrle 1992 verbanck 1990 fig 5c in contrast no information about the distribution of type d deposits in pressure mains is available since the depth profiles fig 5c were measured over seven months the distribution pattern indicates that the structure of a sewer is the determining factor in deposit accumulation flow variation in wet weather can induce erosion of deposits banasiak et al 2005 in addition the release of gaseous products such as ch4 can loose the structure of deposits e g type a and d and leave them vulnerable to erosion banasiak et al 2005 vollertsen and hvitved jacobsen 2000 anaerobic methanogenesis foley et al 2009 and aerobic degradation of cod chen and leung 2000 are some common biochemical reactions in deposits supported by the bidirectional transport of essential nutrients and metabolites between wastewater and deposit fig 5b the aforementioned volatile compounds sections 2 1 3 1 other than these from discharges largely originated from the deposits overall two pairs of processes exist at the liquid solid interface fig 2a i e ① adsorption deposition and resuspension detachment physical deposition and release caused by physical disturbance such as cso fig 2a dashed lines ② uptake and excretion migration and consumption by microorganisms and the release of transformed contaminants back to the wastewater shi et al 2018a shi et al 2018b 5 2 processes in sewer deposits 5 2 1 without odorous compound control the density of microorganisms in deposits is often higher than that in sewage for instance the biological activity in the deposits of a well aerated gravity sewer 2 6 mg doc mg dry wt day was found to be superior to suspended solids 0 6 mg doc mg ss day chen et al 2001 the direct our oxygen utilization rate analysis also corroborated this phenomenon huisman et al 2004 the consequences of these biochemical reactions include ① the stabilization of a deposit marked by a lower organic content regueiro picallo et al 2018 ristenpart 1995 and ② the deposit stratification from the perspective of either organic mineral content fig 5a gravity sewer or microbial metabolic pathway redox potential fig 5b both gravity and pressure sewers for instance the our of microorganisms in type c deposit is often several times of that in the underlying type a deposit vollertsen and hvitved jacobsen 2000 while microorganisms deeper in the deposit e g type a deposit are usually more active than those in the top deposit in terms of h2s and ch4 generation hvitved jacobsen 2001 liu et al 2015 shi et al 2018a fig 5b this shift from aerobic to anaerobic condition has also been observed in thick type d deposits okabe et al 2003 sun et al 2014 furthermore the top layer of type c deposits is often mobile called fluid sediment ahyerre et al 2001a at a speed that is much slower than the bulk sewage verbanck 1990 however the detailed effect of the physical movement of these deposits is unclear analysis of sewer deposits in full scale combined sewers showed that the physical parameters of sewer deposits including ph bulk density and particle size distribution were relatively stable while the chemical composition including the content of hazardous and emerging pollutants exhibits little spatial consistence luo et al 2021 petrie 2021 nevertheless in the longitudinal direction along a continuous section of sewer e g between two drops microbial metabolism in deposits is often arranged in sequence for an established gravity sewer 1500 m 0 75 slope the specific our of microorganisms in deposits decreased along the sewer chen and leung 2000 similarly a declining trend of co2 generation during conveyance was observed in a gravity sewer system 37 km jin et al 2019 indicating a gradually declined aerobic degradation potential analysis of a full scale pressure main showed that srb were more abundant and diverse near the front than in the end section and this distinct pattern in srb coincided with the varying capacities of h2s and vfas generation mohanakrishnan et al 2009b interestingly methanogenesis activity in pressure mains was relatively stable along the sewer and final dissolved ch4 was mainly controlled by the residence time with higher production at longer residence time foley et al 2009 the often more abundant readily degradable nutrients in deposits near the head of a sewer system may be a reason although some patterns are relatively consistent in different studies information on the longitudinal contaminant transformation distribution in sewer deposits is still meager the higher microbial activity near the front of a sewer as shown both here and in section 2 1 suggests that easily biodegradable components in wastewater are largely consumed early during conveyance simply deducing from the density or activity of microorganisms sewer deposits should be responsible for most of the biological activity these biochemical processes cause the shift to anaerobic conditions which facilitates fermentation and generation of vfas relatively low orp 100 mv is required for vfa generation yin et al 2016 and pilot studies suggest that such condition is achievable in type d and a deposits in a gravity sewer usually not in wastewater shi et al 2018a zan et al 2019 hence fermentation in deposits could be the main source of wastewater vfas the gradually increased and then plateaued vfas jin et al 2019 and the sewer length dependent vfa content in wwtp influents yun et al 2013 observed in full scale sewers can then be partly explained by the development of the anaerobic condition and fermentative reactions in deposits along the sewers 5 2 2 with odorous compound control addition of exogenous oxidants e g o2 and nitrate is a common practice to control the release of odorous contaminants e g h2s chlorinated hydrocarbons from sewers which are mainly generated in the deposits hvitved jacobsen et al 2002b pandey et al 2016 wang et al 2013 h2s is the most notorious target since it usually coexists with other odorous compounds oxidants either divert the electron donors for srb to other biochemical reactions e g aerobic oxidation or oxidize the dissolved sulfide e g autotrophic denitrification jiang et al 2013 yang et al 2021 methanogenesis is often inhibited as a side effect because methanogens prefer low redox potential the commonly applied oxidant nitrate has been shown to induce further decline of wastewater cod firer et al 2008 liang et al 2016 mohanakrishnan et al 2009a the influence of a decreasing c n ratio upon denitrification and an increased nitrate level in wastewater on wwtp are still some topics to be investigated additionally the ph elevation through shock treatment with sodium magnesium hydroxide ganigue et al 2011 and dosage of iron firer et al 2008 zhang et al 2009 are some other techniques for odorous contaminant control however the effects on the wastewater quality variation are not clear despite the unclear feedback from the wwt processes these odor control practices may affect the fate of some pollutants in sewer deposits especially heavy metals it can be inferred that some heavy metals can precipitate as metal sulfides in the presence of h2s the inhibited sulfide formation and the oxidation of sulfide pan et al 2022 may shift the heavy metals to more reactive or mobile forms moreover gaseous products such as ch4 have been shown to form cavities inside deposits and leave the sediment vulnerable to hydraulic erosion banasiak et al 2005 vollertsen and hvitved jacobsen 2000 the influence of odor control over the generation of gaseous products in biofilms and type a deposits and the induced changes to the cohesion of deposits warrant further investigation because deposits in combined sewers may be released during wet weather as discussed in the next section eventually the benefits of odor control practices must be weighed against the potential disadvantages to wastewater management both in sewers and the wwtps 5 3 wet weather flow and combined sewer overflow it is a common notion that wastewater quality variation mainly depends on the hydraulic residence time hrt in a sewer augustyniak et al 2021 however the reviewed literature here suggests that pollutant transfer across interfaces complicates the situation figs 2a 5b and hrt is only one of the many factors that affect wastewater quality pollutants can partition into deposits and then be released back into wastewater depending on the hydraulics of wastewater or whether the critical shear stress for the threshold of motion is reached banasiak et al 2005 at low shear stress pollutants stored in deposits can experience long solids residence time in contrast when the wastewater flow rate is high enough and exceeds the critical shear stress deposited pollutants are mobilized and re enter the wastewater the previous discussion is relevant to combined sewers in dry weather and separate sanitary sewers during wet weather wastewater and the associated pollutants in combined sewers are subject to dilution and migration in runoff events the stormwater often accounts for 69 95 of the combined flow petrie 2021 and the combined flow can cause a substantial loss of contaminants from a sewer to the urban water system munro et al 2019 vandewalle et al 2012 for example the load of various hormones in one cso event can be 43 99 of the annual load in a wwtp phillips et al 2012 a source identification study showed that 57 80 of the tkn in the combined flow was from the sewers gasperi et al 2010 overall up to 80 of the contaminant load in overflows can be attributed to deposit erosion ahyerre et al 2000 2001a gasperi et al 2010 as for organic contaminants the release of pahs stored in deposits gasperi et al 2010 and desorbed high molecular weight pharmaceuticals hajj mohamad et al 2017 are two examples regarding heavy metals cu cr and cd were found to be released from sewer deposits during csos forming a significant fraction of the suspended particles el samrani et al 2008 xu et al 2018 aside from these associated with sewer organic matter metal sulfide is a major form of many heavy metals in csos el samrani et al 2004 the erosion of a stabilized deposit by stormwater usually begins with the top deposit type c ahyerre et al 2000 which occurs at low shear stress 0 5 n m2 ahyerre et al 2001b the destabilization of this organic rich deposit explains the high biodegradability of the initial overflow sakrabani et al 2009 the biodegradability eventually declines when the mixed flow picks up the resuspended type a deposits and runoff from the ground so far studies on wastewater and cso discharge in wet weather often focus on contaminants release source identification and cso treatment ahyerre et al 2001b botturi et al 2021 gromaire et al 2001 petrie 2021 the in sewer wastewater quality variation during and after rains storms is a less studied topic during a mild rain degradation of soluble cod may be enhanced because of the resuspended deposit biofilm leung et al 2005 sakrabani et al 2009 however the capability of organics degradation by a substantially disturbed deposit i e without biofilm can drop significantly vollertsen and hvitved jacobsen 2000 besides a considerable amount of deposit can migrate with mixed sewage and runoff upon hydraulic erosion fig 5c however the difference between water quality variation in dry weather and that after wet weather with disturbed deposits is rarely reported with currently available knowledge it seems that sewer biofilm can form in a few days michelbach and wöhrle 1992 but lab scale sedimentation tests and field observations indicate that consolidation of sediment can take 20 days to approximately two months ahyerre et al 2000 ristenpart 1995 a considerable amount of wastewater can flow through a sewer system during this rehabilitation period and thus the pattern of wastewater quality variation as well as the development of the microbial communities in sewage is crucial for both sewer management and downstream wastewater treatment 6 microbes and sewers the powerhouse of biodegradation and the incubator 6 1 overview sewer microorganisms are responsible for most of the previously mentioned biochemical reactions a sewer system is a special niche where distinct microbial communities dissimilar to human fecal bacteria can form lamartina et al 2021 mclellan and roguet 2019 the microbial community within a combined sewer is affected by both human fecal microbes and those brought in by rainwater stormwater mclellan et al 2010 while those in pressure sewers are mainly affected by the microbes in sewage as mentioned in section 5 2 a significant number of microorganisms inhabit sewer deposits prolonging their residence time in sewers the exact residence time of microorganisms and pollutants in sewer deposits is case dependent and often unknown nevertheless according to the time required for microbiological consolidation of deposits and the dechlorination of organohalides laroe et al 2014 ristenpart 1995 the residence time of both organic pollutants such as pcbs and microorganisms in sewer deposits in dry weather can be on the order of weeks or even longer this residence time is much longer than the doubling time of common heterotrophic microorganisms and obligately organohalide respiring bacteria which usually ranges from hours up to a few days löffler et al 2013 therefore deposits partly act as an incubator for functional microorganisms some other factors also influence the in sewer microbial community for instance the nitrate dosed for odor control encouraged the growth of autotrophic denitrifiers mohanakrishnan et al 2009a the microbial structure and composition in sewers are of high interest because they often determine the transformation of contaminants and thus the variation of wastewater quality along a sewer liu et al 2019 besides microbial activity in deposits also influences the cohesion of structure meng et al 2020 meng et al 2019 additionally microbes in sewers seem to be related to the microbial communities downstream in wwtps dottorini et al 2021 guo et al 2021 lamartina et al 2021 nevertheless currently available studies rarely couple the in sewer processes and deposit erosion characteristics with the variation of microbial communities therefore gaps in the knowledge of the interactions among in sewer biological activity contaminant transformation and sedimentation erosion still exist 6 2 suspended microorganisms in sewage the microbial communities in sewage were shown to be dominated by acinetobacter aeromonas and trichococcus species from lactococcus and enterobacteriaceae tend to be enriched vandewalle et al 2012 the in sewer processes must have favored the growth of these species because they were nearly absent in human fecal samples for instance acinetobacter and arcobacter might be enriched during the degradation of calcium palmitate i e fog deposit in aerobic conditions or involved in denitrification he et al 2015 while lactococcus and enterobacteriaceae species are enriched for sugar fermentation batt 2014 trichococcus species are known lactate fermenters interestingly physically separated sewers in the same catchment can develop highly similar microbial communities vandewalle et al 2012 fig 6 the resemblance in microbial communities among different sewage influents has also been reported elsewhere lamartina et al 2021 additionally the sewage bacterial community exhibited seasonal or temperature dependent variation lamartina et al 2021 6 3 sessile microorganisms in deposits currently available information pertinent to microorganisms in sewer deposits mainly the biofilm is mostly about the major in sewer biochemical reactions such as hydrolysis and fermentation with an emphasis on srb and methanogens chen and leung 2000 vollertsen and hvitved jacobsen 2000 zan et al 2019 functional microorganisms specialized in metabolizing organohalides and emerging pollutants are rarely reported krumins et al 2018 since details about sewer biofilms have been recently reviewed elsewhere augustyniak et al 2021 li et al 2019b only the often neglected spatial distribution of microbial communities of sewer biofilm is briefly discussed here to the best of our knowledge no study examined the variation of biofilm microorganisms along a full scale gravity pressure sewer investigation on a pilot scale gravity sewer showed that the dominant bacterial phyla were generally stable including proteobacteria 33 83 bacteroidetes 10 29 and firmicutes 2 17 but the exact microbial composition varied along the sewer jin et al 2018 it seems that hydrolytic and fermentative microorganisms e g trichococcus and cloacibacterium were most active in the middle section of the sewer and their contents decreased after 800 m jin et al 2018 besides hydrogen producing acetogens e g veillonella and anaerolinea and srb e g desulfovibrio and desulfonema followed a similar trend but denitrifiers showed a continuously decreasing trend along the sewer fig 7 a these trends are in line with the active decomposition of particulate and macromolecules early during conveyance as discussed in section 2 1 the detection of trichococcus species in sewer biofilm echoes the idea that biofilm type c and d deposits serves as an incubator for functional microorganisms and also suggests that detached biofilm is a source of planktonic microorganisms in wastewater regarding the srb and methanogens available lab scale and pilot studies indicate that their activities are mostly confined to type d c and a deposits chen et al 2021 guisasola et al 2008 liu et al 2016 shi et al 2018a vollertsen and hvitved jacobsen 2000 the analysis of their spatial distribution along a sewer potentially may facilitate the control of h2s and ch4 emission however whether the srb follow a specific pattern of distribution along a gravity sewer is unclear in contrast methanogens have been demonstrated to vary based on substrate availability along a gravity sewer fig 7b jin et al 2018 to date little is known about the longitudinal dynamics of the biofilm microbial community in pressure mains in addition to the case mentioned in section 5 2 1 mohanakrishnan et al 2009b kiilerich et al found that microbial community structure along their pilot pressure main varied in both species diversity and taxa distribution fig 8 kiilerich et al 2019 overall the species diversity dropped from 0 to 200 m and genera like cloacibacillus anaerovorax and fusibacter were dominant at the end of the pilot sewer kiilerich et al 2019 regarding methanogens controversial discoveries were reported mohanakrishnan et al found a greater number of acetoclastic methanogens near the front and more hydrogenotrophic methanogens near the end mohanakrishnan et al 2009b while kiilerich et al found that both hydrogenotrophic methanogens and acetoclastic methanogens were enriched close to the end of the sewer kiilerich et al 2019 the difference in sewer length might play a role but further research is necessary to examine the spatial distribution pattern of both srb and methanogens 7 discussion currently the fundamental role of sewer systems i e wastewater conveyance still did not change although the literature reviewed here suggests that in sewer reactions transformation and transportation can exert influences on the wastewater quality which in turn might affect the management of wwtps the in sewer physiochemical processes are usually not under control and it is also impractical to run sewers as bioreactors for pollutant treatment however the knowledge gained on the in sewer processes such as the changes of cod loss of organic pollutants to the sewer atmosphere and transformation of certain inorganic and organic pollutants can inform us about ① accumulation and distribution pattern of inorganic e g heavy metals and organic e g organohalides along a sewer so that periodic sewer cleaning or site specific treatment can be administered to reduce the effect of csos ② the variation of wastewater quality which allows us to take precautionary measures in wwtps for a stable treatment performance ③ the release pattern of potentially hazardous volatile compounds and bioaerosols to densely populated urban areas providing necessary information that allows us to reduce or eliminate the health effect of inhalable pollutants fig 9 accordingly two major groups of directions for future sewer research are proposed here 7 1 more emphasis on nonconventional contaminants these major cod bod components have been targets of sewer studies for several decades now to date the in sewer degradation pathways of these easily biodegradable compounds are relatively well known in contrast the migration and transformation of those gaseous pollutants emerging contaminants and more recalcitrant organic pollutants are less known but the fate of these compounds is of interest considering their significant influence on the environment and human health some major topics to be researched include control and treatment of vocs and greenhouse gases emitted from sewer systems based on improved knowledge of in sewer deposition and sewer gas ventilation transport and transformation of ppcps in sewer deposits and the concurrent variation of arg and arb in sewers interactions between the transformation of common cod components such as carbohydrates and the degradation of pcbs in sewer deposits 7 2 validation of conclusions extrapolated from bench scale and pilot studies bench scale bioreactors and pilot sewer systems have all been reported as simulating platforms in past sewer studies liu et al 2015 however caution should be taken while extrapolating conclusions gained in these studies to full scale sewers as mentioned in section 2 pilot scale gravity sewers fed by wwtp influents cannot reveal the fast degradation of carbohydrates or the precipitation of proteinaceous materials in branch sewers this deficiency also exists in the study of phosphorus regarding these bioreactors with and without filling materials for biofilm attachment only generic biofilm processes can be inferred hence the results from a laboratory study need to be paired with analyses of a real sewer which is often missing some topics to be considered include standardization of field sampling protocols that cover different levels of sewers i e branch collector trunk and interceptor sewers while taking the varying hydraulic condition inside sewers into account odor and bioaerosol control strategy development based on an improved understanding of sewer gas ventilation and the gas exchange between the atmosphere and the sewer wastewater quality fluctuation during sewer deposit rehabilitation after the disturbance caused by csos on the other hand sewer systems in modern urban areas usually cover a large area thus even a study of one individual interceptor sewer can be challenging to overcome this problem robots and sensors can be deployed robots can help collect samples without breaking a sewer line while sensors can be planted in a sewer system and function in both dry and wet weather saving manpower and effort by providing real time information on key water quality parameters 8 conclusions variations of wastewater quality in sewers resulted from complex physio biochemical processes although knowledge gaps still exist in many aspects of in sewer processes research in the past suggests that many of these processes are spatiotemporally organized and some of them demonstrate relatively consistent patterns especially the covariation of contaminants and biofilm microorganisms along a continuous sewer section with diverse and contrasting patterns of urbanization around the world and challenges from climate change sewerage management needs to be improved in terms of reduced cso impact decreased greenhouse gas emissions controlled odor and bioaerosols release etc to achieve these objectives better comprehension of in sewer processes is necessary which would eventually assist in improving the downstream wwtp performance because sewers partly act as a pre treatment unit credit authorship contribution statement yaohuan gao

15277,eutrophication and the predicted limited future availability of rock phosphate has triggered the increased development of phosphorus p recovery technologies however for remote regions recovery solutions are still limited here we report on a novel pilot scale technology filtraflotm p reactor to recover phosphate po4 3 from wastewater effluent through a filtration adsorption process in a rural setting this unit employs enhanced gravitational filtration through adsorption media here a novel koh deacetylated crab carapace based chitosan calcite material ccm with continuous self backwashing trials were designed to assess how the filtraflotm p unit would operate under real conditions both at low and high po4 3 levels and to ascertain the effectiveness of the adsorbent to recover phosphate from final effluent high removal was achieved at low phosphate concentrations bringing the residual effluent po4 3 level below 1 mg l eu limit for sensitive water bodies while phosphate was efficiently harvested at more than 50 at higher po4 3 levels surface microprecipitation and inner sphere complexation were postulated as the main po4 3 adsorption mechanisms through xrd xps and edx elemental mapping further a quality assessment of the p enriched ccm which could be used as a potential soil amendment was undertaken to consider elemental composition microbiological assessment and quantification of organic micropollutants quality analysis indicated 2 5 p2o5 present trace levels well below legislative limits of heavy metals and extremely low levels of organic pollutants e g pcbs pharmaceuticals no detectable levels of target bacterial pathogens were observed pot trials showed that ryegrass cultivated with the addition of the ccm adsorbent achieved higher plant dry matter and p concentration when compared to unfertilised controls with a slow release kinetic pattern this study showed that ccm used with the filtraflotm p pilot reactor has high potential to recover phosphate from effluents and encourage resource recovery via bio based management of waste graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords waste management adsorption wastewater treatment eutrophication fertiliser quality circular economy data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction phosphorus p is an essential element for all living organisms on earth with an unique role in modern agricultural production jiao et al 2021 however the excess discharge of p into freshwater which occurs mostly as phosphate po4 3 can lead to the degradation of water quality and eutrophication palansooriya et al 2021 suresh kumar et al 2019 eutrophication results in a loss of biodiversity in water systems and can lead to the production of toxic algal blooms shakoor et al 2021 to address the problem of both phosphate pollution and dwindling terrestrial rock phosphate reserves a number of po4 3 recovery technologies have recently been developed at the laboratory and pilot scale bogdan et al 2020 egle et al 2015 however for rural regions recovery solutions for po4 3 are limited e g decentralised treatment options poor infrastructure etc which is a limiting factor for further environmental development in such areas egle et al 2016 therefore this study looked at a technical solution which would be practically applicable in a rural setting to remove po4 3 from wastewater effluent phosphate removal and recovery through adsorption has been identified as an efficient technology as it requires little energy is a simple technology to apply and can be highly effective even at low p concentrations almanassra et al 2021 pap et al 2021 in addition adsorption solutions can provide potential economic benefits to an area by recovering po4 3 from wastewater through adsorption onto material sourced from industry waste here fishery and food waste later the saturated material could be re purposed as a low cost p rich product e g as a soil conditioner if the final material is also low in other co adsorbed contaminants chrispim et al 2019 for instance cao et al 2022 pyrolysed crab shells to enhance the adsorption performance for po4 3 park et al 2018 explored the effect of pyrolysis temperature on po4 3 removal while jang and lee 2019 prepared a chitosan ca organically modified montmorillonite beads to overcome the influence of competing ions however the adsorption capacity is a function of various adsorbent characteristics i e surface chemistry and area as well as the physicochemical characteristics of a wastewater i e ph concentration of p and presence of other competing ions organic molecules the presence of co adsorbed contaminants on a p saturated material obtained from wwtp filtration will depend on the physicochemical characteristics of the wastewater and adsorbent selectivity pap et al 2021 efforts to upscale adsorption based po4 3 recovery processes to a pilot scale e g as fixed bed columns adsorbers using real wastewater are challenging due to high flowrates exceeding the hydraulic properties and stability of the adsorbent and fouling of the adsorbent by the wastewater matrix shortening its operational life pap et al 2021 however a few pilot scale po4 3 adsorption systems have been reported in the literature namely a hybrid of copper modified chitosan beads combined with a dissolved air flotation process an et al 2019 a mobile pilot scale plant using amorphous calcium silicate hydrates okano et al 2016 and various processes using lanthanum based polymeric nanocomposites zhang et al 2021 iron oxide nanoparticle loaded chitosan composites kim et al 2018 iron coated sand granules lambert et al 2021 iron manganese oxy hydroxides aquaszero kalaitzidou et al 2016 and fe3o4 la oh 3 composites ahmed et al 2021 here the filtraflotm p reactor adsorber used together with a chitosan calcite adsorbent material ccm was implemented as a novel technology to recover po4 3 from wastewater treatment plant wwtp final effluent through a filtration adsorption process previously we reported using this ccm for po4 3 removal from synthetic aqueous solutions pap et al 2020b 2020a the filtraflotm p is a non commercial reactor which was developed by veolia for rapid gravitational filtration phosphorus adsorption for small scale use filtraflotm 2019 the ccm material can be synthesised using inexpensive and widely available waste material such as crab carapace or other exoskeleton shell material by scaling up this process to the multi kilogram scale and utilising it within a real wwtp setting this work aimed to provide a proof of concept for this technology the filtraflotm p unit employs enhanced gravitational filtration through an adsorption media with continuous self backwashing trials were designed to 1 assess how the filtraflotm p would operate under real wwtp conditions 2 ascertain the effectiveness of the ccm in recovering harvesting po4 3 from high p final effluent and 3 ascertain the effectiveness of the ccm in reducing effluent p to 1 mg l thus making the effluent compliant with eu discharge requirements for wwtp s discharging into sensitive areas at risk of eutrophication currently valid for wwtps of 10 000 p e furthermore a qualitative study using plants and pot trials was undertaken to consider the applicability of the saturated ccm adsorbent as a fertiliser product the novelty here lies in the holistic approach taken to address an emerging problem in the adsorption field few studies have undertaken pilot scale testing of a low cost adsorbent using real wwtp effluent utilised this saturated spent adsorbent in a relevant agricultural setting and fully assessed the chemical quality of the spent adsorbent in

synthesis the parent material for the chitosan calcite adsorbent used here was brown crab cancer pagurus carapace the chitosan calcite adsorbent was created from the raw carapace through optimised thermochemical modification with deacetylation of the chitin chain in the presence of potassium hydroxide koh pap et al 2020a briefly raw carapace material was washed with tap water dried milled and sieved to 0 5 4 mm for example 1 kg of material was then mixed with koh solution impregnation ratio 0 1 kg koh kg raw material by weight the resulting impregnated material was then heated at 105 c for 150 min after cooling the resultant material was rinsed with milli q water to eliminate any by products or residues dried at 60 c for a further 2 h and then stored in plastic boxes the approximate calculated cost involved in production of this ccm was estimated at 0 561 us kg 561 us ton pap et al 2020b 2 3 pilot scale trials for po4 3 removal and recovery based on laboratory bench scale results pap et al 2020a the veolia water technologies filtraflotm p pilot reactor was tested using the ccm adsorbent at the scottish water horizons development centre at bo ness scotland in january february 2020 supplementary materials s2 fig s1 the centre is integrated into the bo ness wastewater treatment plant a fully operational municipal wwtp that routinely employs advanced biological treatment to remove p from wastewater the development centre facilitates the application of pilot scale plants to treat wastewater from the adjacent wwtp as effluent can be directly siphoned off as required from various stages within the wwtp process i e raw influent wastewater and primary secondary or final effluents for our trials we utilised only the secondary final effluent a 100 l filtraflotm p pilot reactor 1 2 m in height and 0 5 m in diameter made from 0 5 cm thick plastic was mounted on a wooden support housing box fig 1 a filtraflotm p employs enhanced gravitational filtration through a granular media here the developed ccm with continuous self backwashing the lower part of the reactor shaped as an inverted circular cone 15 l in size and 30 slope angle was designed to increase backwash efficiency the ccm granular adsorbent is shown in fig 1b the reactor is equipped with an air supported self backwashing system on the bottom to enable adsorbent recirculation fig 1c through this system the adsorbent from the bottom of the vessel can be airlifted using an entrained compressed air flow and reintroduced into the top of the reactor as well as increasing adsorption efficiency the backwashing helps to avoid compaction biofouling of the granular media four trials 1 4 were carried out at the wwtp during the first trial 1 the reactor column was filled to a 15 cm bed depth measured from the base of the cylindrical part with 11 kg of ccm granules particle size 0 5 4 mm these conditions were selected following preliminary lab experiments to maximise p adsorption capacity and efficiency for trials 2 4 the column was filled to 20 cm bed depth with 15 kg of ccm granules the reactor inlet valve which was fitted to the middle of the reactor fig s2a was connected with an accordion hose to feed inlet water secondary treated wastewater into the reactor this was supplied from an intermediate 1 m3 bulk container ibc fig s2b the inlet water was diffused downward into the middle of the adsorbent bed volume fig s3 another hoses were connected to the outlet at the top of the reactor to evacuate the filtered treated and high turbidity dirty water to a collection sewer fig s3 the dirty water been generated on the isolated top part red section on fig s3 of the reactor due to the adsorbent recirculation process all valves were manually operated when needed from the ibc tank the wastewater was pumped into the adsorption bed at 200 l h an mxv electric submersible pump caprari italy was used to convey water at the desired flowrate for each run once the adsorption bed was saturated with po4 3 the material was evacuated from the reactor manually and replaced with fresh adsorbent the point at which saturation occurred was established using measurements of p using a total phosphate tube test lovibond reagent set germany by measuring the inlet outlet po4 3 concentration at 2 h intervals the saturated ccm was stored on site in plastic boxes until the end of the trial period subsequently at the environmental research institute thurso the saturated ccm after trial 1 was dried at 105 c overnight prior to further analysis for the four trials e g low p 1 and 2 spiked high p 3 and 4 two were performed using low po4 3 concentrations 1 mg l and two with higher po4 3 concentrations spiked to 7 mg l within the ibc inlet tank other than the difference in the weight of adsorbent mass and the bed height in trial 1 all other process parameters were kept fixed between trials fig 2 shows the schematic of the pilot test process 2 4 wastewater effluent the typical composition of the secondary wastewater effluent used in the trials is shown in table 1 inlet samples were taken two times per day with every refill of the ibc tank outlet samples of about 1 l were taken from the reactor at 2 h intervals while running and ph conductivity turbidity po4 3 and cod were determined in the field after sampling aliquots of each sample were also filtered through 0 45 µm pore size nylon syringe filters fisher scientific uk for further analysis the aliquot for icp analysis was also stabilised acidified with ultra trace metal grade concentrated nitric acid hno3 immediately following filtration phosphate concentrations obtained on site using the total phosphate tube tests lovibond reagent set were only used to track the po4 3 breakthrough curves in the field these results were only considered indicative and were not standardised therefore they are not included in the manuscript 2 5 quality assessment of the saturated adsorbent a hno3 h2o2 extraction of samples of the saturated ccm adsorbent was used to determine total concentrations of target elements additionally milli q water and 2 citric acid extractions were also utilised to estimate the relative solubility of target elements methodological details on all three extractions are given in supplementary materials s3 table 2 shows a summary of the key conditions used for each of the three digestions extractions noted above triple super phosphate tsp obtained from pillaert meststoffen nv ghent belgium was chosen as a representative commercial fertiliser currently used in agriculture and was analysed alongside the saturated ccm as a fertiliser control regarding organic contaminants organochlorine oc pesticides polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs as the most representative of the persistent organic pollutants together with approximately 16 different common pharmaceuticals phcs were tested in the spent ccm more details on the organic assays are given in supplementary materials s4 2 6 microbiological assay given the pathogens regulated in the eu fertiliser regulations 2019 1009 table s1 testing was performed on spent ccm using selective differential media macconkey agar for enumeration of e coli total coliforms and enterococcus spp using a drop plate method with serial dilutions in addition spread plating of bacterial enrichments from the saturated ccm were used to assess presence absence of e coli coliforms salmonella spp and shigella spp while un enriched suspensions were used to carry out total viable microbial counts full methodological details on the microbiological assays are given in supplementary materials s4 2 7 characterisation of the saturated ccm adsorbent the saturated ccm after trial 1 was further characterised with different instrumental techniques for ccm morphology and surface elemental characteristics analysis we employed a jeol jsm 7800 f field emission scanning electron microscope fe sem using an accelerating voltage of 20 kv and an approximate beam current of 1 na energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx microanalysis utilised an oxford instruments x max 80 mm2 detector x ray powder

scofield relative sensitivity factors rsf were used and peaks were fitted using shirley background and gaussian 70 lorentzian 30 peak shapes 2 8 pot trials using the methods described in bogdan et al 2022 a pot trial was established to assess the p availability to plants of the ccm product tsp was utilised as a positive control while the omission of any fertilising product zero p was used as a negative control for the trial perennial ryegrass lolium perenne was grown on slightly acidic river sand ph 6 7 and an alkali artificial mineral substrate ph 8 5 3 results 3 1 phosphate recovery and water quality fig 3 a d shows the average phosphate concentrations in the influent and effluent and removal efficiency fluctuation during the four different trials for trial 1 and 2 fig 3a b the horizontal dotted lines show that after approximately 17 and 35 h running time the phosphate concentration of the effluent reached 0 5 mg l the regulatory limit for sensitive water bodies as set by the eu water framework directive wfd and us national pollution discharge elimination system npdes adsorption capacity increased approximately five fold from 300 mg kg and 363 mg kg in trials 1 and 2 to 1590 mg kg and 1859 mg kg in trials 3 and 4 the overall p recovery rate of the demonstrator during the trials was 50 fluctuations in effluent ph are shown in fig 4 a the initial ph of the wastewater influent was generally neutral and during the process the ph increased to 8 5 indicative of the alkali nature of the ccm phpzc 8 78 similarly the conductivity of the effluent reduced only slightly from an average value of 1450 μs cm fig 4b and overall the variation was negligible during the trials effluent turbidity increased during all the trials from 10 ntu fig 4c to 50 60 ntu see discussion fig s4a c in supplementary materials shows how these parameters evolved during the trials to determine the ability of the ccm to remove other nutrients beyond phosphate e g sulphate ton total oxidised nitrogen ammonium and organic matter expressed as cod and doc these parameters were also measured before and after the trials fig 5 a d additionally various macro mg ca k na and microelements al fe cu mn ni zn were monitored fig s5a d results revealed that small trace amounts of doc mg ni and k were released into the effluent while cod during trial 1 and 2 was also released some of the micro and macroelements e g ca cu fe mn and zn were removed in low quantities fig s5a d the concentration profiles for other parameters largely remained unchanged or only varied slightly during the trials it is worth noting that microelement concentrations in the influents were also low table 1 so no notable quantities of metals were adsorbed onto the ccm as was further confirmed with the quality analysis of the saturated ccm 3 2 instrumental characterisation of the saturated ccm xrd results for the saturated ccm are presented in fig s6 the main crystalline phase identified in the ccm was calcite with data matching well to the standard powder diffraction file in the international centre for diffraction data icdd database broad diffraction peaks around 9 6 and 19 were likely due to the presence of the chitosan polymer after a comparison with standard diffraction matrices for hydroxyapatite hap and brushite these compounds could also be identified on the phosphate saturated ccm surface fig s6 fig 6 a b shows the sem edx elemental mapping images and spectra respectively while table s2 shows the average elemental composition of the phosphate laden ccm adsorbent after the wastewater treatment the edx spectra confirmed high o 55 2 and ca 26 6 content due to calcite c 18 7 due to chitosan and the existence of p 1 0 adsorbed to the particles of the ccm other elements e g mg na k al could be present from the adsorbent itself or from the wastewater while the presence of au was attributed to the coating used during the sem edx analysis in order to improve image quality table s2 to determine the nature of c o n ca and p functional groups present and the adsorption mechanisms at play xps analysis of saturated ccm samples was carried out fig 7 a f fig 7a shows a survey scan for saturated ccm with surface elemental composition analysis indicated a surface composition of c 34 1 atomic o 45 4 atomic ca 10 7 atomic mg 4 3 atomic n 3 4 atomic and p 2 1 atomic which is slightly different to the edx results the three peaks at c1s were attributed to c h c c 284 78 ev c o 286 28 ev and o c o co3 289 28 ev lee et al 2021 due to the reaction of calcium with phosphate the peak for co3 289 28 ev was relatively weak the o1s band was composed of two sub bands fig 7c attributed to c o co3 531 18 ev and c o 532 58 ev since the calcium phosphate peak at o1s were close to 530 9 531 1 ev region which is in the range of the characteristic peak for carbonate co3 no characteristic p related peak could be detected on o1s ramola et al 2021 the n1s spectrum of the p saturated ccm fig 7d was deconvoluted at binding energies of 398 58 ev nh2 and 399 98 ev nh c n zhang et al 2018 the ca2p spectrum of p laden ccm contained a peak at 347 18 ev caco3 cahpo4 ca3 po4 2 this proves the existence of ca2 on the surface and thus possible ca2 phosphate interactions fig 7e samaraweera et al 2021 the peak at 133 58 ev from p2p fig 7f was also the result of several calcium phosphate compounds i e cahpo4 ca3 po4 2 zhang et al 2017 the composition in atomic from high resolution xps scans of the phosphate laden ccm adsorbent is shown in table s3 more detail on this ccm adsorbent and its characteristics can be found in pap et al 2020a 2020b 3 3 saturated ccm chemical quality results for the three extraction methods used to determine macroelement and microelement concentrations for the ccm are shown in table 3 and table 4 respectively in terms of organic compounds present very low concentrations of several organic contaminants e g o p dde p p dde and ddx polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs e g pcb 28 and pcb 52 and pharmaceuticals e g paracetamol were detected at the low µg kg level and far below current legislative limits for organo mineral products as listed in the legislative limit for who toxicity equivalents kg 1 dm of pcdd f13 more information about organic pollutants in ccm can be found in bogdan et al 2022 microbiological testing showed that there were no detectable target pathogens of concern as listed in eu fertiliser regulations 2019 1009 present in the saturated ccm table 5 un enriched suspensions utilising 25 g of the saturated ccm were also plated onto nutrient agar and incubated to assess general aerobic plate counts i e viable non target bacteria and fungi these returned positive growth for the saturated ccm indicating that some microorganisms likely fungi and bacterial spores were present further non target genomic analysis would be required to determine the specific species cultured 3 4 p availability in soil the amendment of a slightly acidic substrate with the ccm showed a beneficial effect on plant p uptake 3 3 0 8 mg p g dry wt in shoots when compared to an unfertilised control 0 12 0 02 mg p g dry wt fig s7 however using an alkali substrate plant p uptake in ccm fertilised pots reduced 0 38 0 13 mg p g dry wt and was only slightly higher than in unfertilised controls 0 20 0 03 mg p g dry wt fig s7 phosphorus uptake efficiency availability pue using the ccm after four months of ryegrass growth with two substrates was 10 2 river sand substrate and 1 1 0 4 alkali artificial mineral substrate time had a pronounced effect on p release from the ccm which indicated the slow release characteristics of the ccm bogdan et al 2022 4 discussion 4 1 pilot scale study and mechanism analysis the results from the phosphate adsorption trials indicated two quite different options for the filtraflotm p adsorber combined with the ccm adsorbent also the average effluent composition after each trial and the comparison with the regulation limits i e eu usa and china for the discharge showed in table s4 for further comparation as fig 3a b illustrates the ccm adsorbent was capable of removing phosphate even at low concentrations bringing residual phosphate levels below 0 5 mg l this shows its applicability in terms of efficient processing of low p effluents i e its potential for use in preventing eutrophication in sensitive receiving waters the clear difference in the phosphate adsorption patterns between trial 1 and 2 is almost certainly a result of the different ccm masses used in the filtraflotm p reactor in these 2 trials 11 kg vs 15 kg further the high phosphate concentration trials showed its high phosphate harvesting potential fig 3c d at higher phosphate concentrations on calcite rich surface it is proposed that the calcite will improve the microprecipitation formation of calcium phosphate phase and promote the growth of a calcium phosphate li et al 2017 the use of secondary wastewater effluent without residual suspended solids limited fouling of the adsorption bed from the results it can be estimated that with 15 kg of ccm approximately 20 m3 of wastewater could be filtered whilst harvesting phosphate further process optimisation related to the bed height in the reactor flow rate of the influent and granulation of the ccm adsorbent should be considered from the gathered data the amount of phosphate enriched ccm adsorbent material which could be produced would range approximately from 10 200 tons year wwtp from final effluent for wwtp s with capacities of 10 5 000 pe additionally the filtraflotm p is a mobile unit which can be easily transported by small truck and is readily installed therefore it has the potential to offer a compact labour saving option for phosphate recovery at rural remote areas e g farms and small wwtps the recovery of phosphate in these locations could mitigate surface runoff eutrophication with the additional benefit of that the saturated ccm can be used as a source of p in local production and consumption okano et al 2016 also developed a mobile pilot scale plant for p recovery the mobile pilot plant consisted of a 1000 l reactor a self made filtration system and ancillary equipment they assessed the ability of amorphous calcium silicate hydrates to recover phosphate from anaerobic sludge digestion liquor in this study the process did not drastically alter the ph of the treated effluent to extremely acid or alkaline it would not be necessary to regulate outlet water ph after a real water treatment scenario thus reducing the need for additional chemicals reagents and reducing operational costs at slight alkaline ph values on which the filtraflotm p ccm operates at ph 8 9 oh ions may interfere directly with phosphate adsorption this may be partially counteracted by favoured hydroxyapatite ca5 po4 3 oh and brushite cahpo4 precipitation on the ccm surface a microprecipitation mechanism pap et al 2022 another important removal mechanism was revealed due to the slightly increase in effluent ph since under these conditions ligand exchange whereby h2po4 and hpo4 2 anions replaced co3 2 on the ccm surface and formed inner sphere surface complexes via lewis acid base interactions between p and ca co3 groups zhang et al 2019 phosphate anions behave like lewis bases and can act as electron donors donating electron pairs by binding to ca atoms qu et al 2020 at the same time carbonate ions may be displaced into solution driving ph increases fig 4a the sharp increase in turbidity at the beginning of each trial could be due to smaller lighter adsorbent particles being washed out flowrates were 200 l h however after the initial wash of the adsorbent bed no significant loss of ccm was detected from the system after this stage the turbidity levels started to decrease again and stabilised at 10 times the influent values 50 60 ntu this could be connected with the recirculation process continuous self backwashing of the adsorbent and the main ccm phosphate removal mechanism namely the replacement of carbonate co3 2 ions these may then form salts with available mg na and k in the treated wastewater and thus increase turbidity kong et al 2019 therefore before discharge it would be desirable to integrate combine the filtraflotm p unit with further filtration e g slow sand filtration the sand filter would be used to retain the larger suspended solids and dissolved organic matter up to a certain concentration slow sand filtration is a cost effective and low energy technology it easily integrates with physico chemical filtraflotm p and biological processes for turbidity removal from wastewater verma et al 2017 patel et al 2022 2020 suggested an integration of different sand filters with waste biomass derived activated carbons to remove cod bod and tds from wastewater the cod indicative of organic compounds and ammonium removal may have additional benefits if this were to increase the organic carbon and nitrogen content of the loaded ccm wang et al 2020 assuming these organics are not undesirable harmful contaminants which is assessed in detail in the quality analysis section mg and k release could be explained by the material composition since the ccm adsorbent contains high levels of mg originating from the crab carapace itself and k from the activation with potassium hydroxide additionally k and mg could form complexes with organic compounds and solubilise additional benefits for the saturated ccm as potential fertiliser could be seen in the removal trends for metals i e ca cu fe mn and zn it is well known that alkaline earth and transition metals are essential elements in the soil environment shepherd et al 2016 these mineral nutrients can influence plant growth through both limitation and toxicity mn toxicity sometimes occurs in acid soils while alkaline soils are characterised by poor availability of fe cu mn and zn liu et al 2014 instrumental characterisation further confirmed the governing adsorption mechanisms for phosphate removal microprecipitation could be identified on the xrd pattern with the two vague peaks at 26 and 47 corresponding to hap hydroxyapatite and 31 5 for brushite implying that a ca p interaction occurred in the adsorbents fig s6 lin et al 2017 these reactions can occur under alkaline conditions according to equations 1 5 c a 2 3 h p o 4 2 4 o h c a 5 p o 4 3 o h 3 h 2 o h a p 2 c a 2 h p o 4 2 2 h 2 o c a h p o 4 2 h 2 o b r u s h i t e through element mapping fig 6a it is clear that the distribution of p in ccm after phosphate adsorption is closely related to ca based on above sem edx it can be confirmed that the phosphate adsorption by ccm is strongly correlated with the proportion of calcium present on the surface park et al 2018 furthermore xps study explored p chemical state and potential adsorption mechanisms in ccm after the wastewater treatment a strong p 2p peak was obtained for ccm fig 7f representing specific ca p interaction 133 58 ev through a ligand exchange inner sphere complexation these interactions can be expressed as 3 c

forming mononuclear bidentate surface complexes and one calcium centre forms mononuclear monodentate surface complexes liu et al 2019 mitrogiannis et al 2017 yang et al 2020 4 2 quality analysis and pot trials several key quality indicators for the ccm were assessed p content of the saturated ccm adsorbent ranged from 2 up to 7 p2o5 depending on the effluent phosphate content quality analysis indicated only trace levels well below legislative limits of heavy metals and organic pollutants and no detectable levels of target bacterial pathogens the trace levels of organic contaminants observed are to be expected given the organo mineral nature of ccm through chitin calcite chojnacka et al 2020 while the detection of paracetamol a painkiller on sub µg kg levels is almost certainly as a result of its widespread and frequent usage li et al 2021 taken together these quality data indicate that the saturated ccm adsorbent following use in wastewater treatment is a good candidate for use as a soil agriculture supplement the two solubility extractions e g water and 2 citric acid would also be expected to differ from each other and from the total fraction digests as the aqueous extracts used would not be expected to dissolve all product phases and each is instead used to simply estimate varying degrees of solubility i e to estimate fractions of elements likely to be more or less extractable or phytoavailable kabata pendias 2004 numerous aqueous extracts chemical solutions are employable for this purpose but in this case we simply selected water to estimate the proportion of elements most easily readily soluble in the products along with 2 citric acid as this has previously been used in other work more focussed on p availability wang et al 2012 weber et al 2014 in general results obtained for the products tested for macro and microelements are also compared to current legislative limits as stated within the eu fertilising products regulation fpr eu 2019 1009 in tables 3 and 4 in terms of potentially toxic elements both products were within the legislative limits also ccm product meet the key p2o5 requirements tables 3 and 4 showed total concentrations mg kg dry weight of elements and mineral oxide values in comparison to current relevant eu legislative limits given in eu fertilising products regulation fpr eu 2019 1009 ccm showed a beneficial effect on plant growth p concentration in shoots and slow release kinetics when compared to the unfertilised controls during the pot trials based on the pot trials and the ccm characteristics 2 5 p2o5 it can be compared to other commercial soil conditioners available on market it should however be noted that a direct comparison between commercial products and ccm as a soil conditioners is only indicative because of the different p2o5 content different route to the market i e the price 561 us ton is for the adsorbent production and not the final price for the saturated material and ccm have other beneficial characteristics such as increase in soil organic matter content and texture buffer against soil acidification and chitin chitosan has antibacterial properties furthermore the p2o5 content of ccm could be increased up to 7 if the filtraflotm p reactor if deployed to a rural area e g on farm and fed with a high phosphate effluent 4 3 general consideration crab carapace is composed mainly of calcite and chitin and is a common waste by product from the seafood industry worldwide millions of tons are created wasted annually most of which is disposed of in landfill lu et al 2007 re purposing such waste into a value added product i e as a p adsorbent and potential soil amendment could provide multiple agricultural benefits including increased soil organic matter content improved physical soil properties texture provision of essential plant nutrients and buffering through caco3 content against soil acidification caused by nitrogen application in addition chitin chitosan has antibacterial properties which may in turn support rhizobial multiplication by biologically controlling root pathogenic organisms nekvapil et al 2021 pap et al 2020a if we consider the recycling pathways to adsorbent fertilising product the formulation proposed refers to a possible product function category pfc according to the wording in the eu fertilising products regulations eu 2019 1009 the list of animal by products abp and derived products to be included under compound material category cmc n 10 is currently under definition crab carapace belonging to category 3 k i shells from shellfish with soft tissue or flesh of abp regulation ec 1069 2009 might be added provided the abp end point is achieved however due to the interaction of the adsorbent with wastewater ccm requires an extensive qa qc before it could be included in cmc 10 the recycling of ccm also can occur under existing national legislation a further benefit of a ccm adsorbent is that it can be applied to land without further processing or after milling to powder using existing soil application machinery it is an alternative to sewage sludge or manure spreading and can act as a general soil improver targeted users are primarily local farmers for fertilisation of agricultural land but also technical services within municipalities or private enterprises for landscaping works a limiting factor may be that the seasonality of agricultural use may not coincide with the production cycle of the ccm necessitating storage however if the ccm adsorbent is mixed with other organic fertilisers the storage units of those products could be used and therefore there would be a priori no limiting factor for this use factors in support of this pathway include the direct use of ccm with an elevated p and ca content and several additional soil improvement properties adding organic carbon k and texture additionally waste repurposing is utilised creating circular links with the fishery and seafood industries this approach is highly consistent with the principles of a sustainable circular economy whereby re use or recycling of waste materials is optimised to extract their maximum value fig 8 shows the main stakeholders that may be involved in the recycling pathways ploteau et al 2021a 2021b 5 conclusion a pilot scale adsorption system was developed for in situ phosphate recovery at a bo ness wwtp the main conclusions here are high phosphate removal recovery was achieved during the trials even at low phosphate concentrations bringing the residual p level below 1 mg l the eu limit for sensitive water bodies the slightly increased turbidity noted in treated water e g likely due to magnesium and potassium carbonates may require integration combination of the filtraflo m p unit with slow sand filtration the results showed that the filtraflo m p unit with ccm could serve as a water polishing unit with low phosphate concentration effluents or as a phosphate harvesting unit where phosphate concentrations were high surface microprecipitation and ligand exchange were postulated as key phosphate adsorption mechanisms through xrd sem edx and xps analysis quality assessment of the p enriched ccm was based on elemental composition macro nutrients and heavy metals microbiological evaluation and quantification of organic micropollutants this indicated 2 5 p2o5 trace levels well below legislative limits of heavy metals i e cu co and organic pollutants e g pcbs and paracetamol and no detectable levels of target bacterial pathogens a pot trial was conducted at ghent university to examine p availability of ccm on different substrate during a 4 month growth of perennial ryegrass the results showed that ryegrass plants treated with the ccm adsorbent achieved higher plant dry matter and p concentration compared to the unfertilised control overall this study has demonstrated a fully integrated approach assessing the feasibility of laboratory scale to pilot scale

15277,eutrophication and the predicted limited future availability of rock phosphate has triggered the increased development of phosphorus p recovery technologies however for remote regions recovery solutions are still limited here we report on a novel pilot scale technology filtraflotm p reactor to recover phosphate po4 3 from wastewater effluent through a filtration adsorption process in a rural setting this unit employs enhanced gravitational filtration through adsorption media here a novel koh deacetylated crab carapace based chitosan calcite material ccm with continuous self backwashing trials were designed to assess how the filtraflotm p unit would operate under real conditions both at low and high po4 3 levels and to ascertain the effectiveness of the adsorbent to recover phosphate from final effluent high removal was achieved at low phosphate concentrations bringing the residual effluent po4 3 level below 1 mg l eu limit for sensitive water bodies while phosphate was efficiently harvested at more than 50 at higher po4 3 levels surface microprecipitation and inner sphere complexation were postulated as the main po4 3 adsorption mechanisms through xrd xps and edx elemental mapping further a quality assessment of the p enriched ccm which could be used as a potential soil amendment was undertaken to consider elemental composition microbiological assessment and quantification of organic micropollutants quality analysis indicated 2 5 p2o5 present trace levels well below legislative limits of heavy metals and extremely low levels of organic pollutants e g pcbs pharmaceuticals no detectable levels of target bacterial pathogens were observed pot trials showed that ryegrass cultivated with the addition of the ccm adsorbent achieved higher plant dry matter and p concentration when compared to unfertilised controls with a slow release kinetic pattern this study showed that ccm used with the filtraflotm p pilot reactor has high potential to recover phosphate from effluents and encourage resource recovery via bio based management of waste graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords waste management adsorption wastewater treatment eutrophication fertiliser quality circular economy data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction phosphorus p is an essential element for all living organisms on earth with an unique role in modern agricultural production jiao et al 2021 however the excess discharge of p into freshwater which occurs mostly as phosphate po4 3 can lead to the degradation of water quality and eutrophication palansooriya et al 2021 suresh kumar et al 2019 eutrophication results in a loss of biodiversity in water systems and can lead to the production of toxic algal blooms shakoor et al 2021 to address the problem of both phosphate pollution and dwindling terrestrial rock phosphate reserves a number of po4 3 recovery technologies have recently been developed at the laboratory and pilot scale bogdan et al 2020 egle et al 2015 however for rural regions recovery solutions for po4 3 are limited e g decentralised treatment options poor infrastructure etc which is a limiting factor for further environmental development in such areas egle et al 2016 therefore this study looked at a technical solution which would be practically applicable in a rural setting to remove po4 3 from wastewater effluent phosphate removal and recovery through adsorption has been identified as an efficient technology as it requires little energy is a simple technology to apply and can be highly effective even at low p concentrations almanassra et al 2021 pap et al 2021 in addition adsorption solutions can provide potential economic benefits to an area by recovering po4 3 from wastewater through adsorption onto material sourced from industry waste here fishery and food waste later the saturated material could be re purposed as a low cost p rich product e g as a soil conditioner if the final material is also low in other co adsorbed contaminants chrispim et al 2019 for instance cao et al 2022 pyrolysed crab shells to enhance the adsorption performance for po4 3 park et al 2018 explored the effect of pyrolysis temperature on po4 3 removal while jang and lee 2019 prepared a chitosan ca organically modified montmorillonite beads to overcome the influence of competing ions however the adsorption capacity is a function of various adsorbent characteristics i e surface chemistry and area as well as the physicochemical characteristics of a wastewater i e ph concentration of p and presence of other competing ions organic molecules the presence of co adsorbed contaminants on a p saturated material obtained from wwtp filtration will depend on the physicochemical characteristics of the wastewater and adsorbent selectivity pap et al 2021 efforts to upscale adsorption based po4 3 recovery processes to a pilot scale e g as fixed bed columns adsorbers using real wastewater are challenging due to high flowrates exceeding the hydraulic properties and stability of the adsorbent and fouling of the adsorbent by the wastewater matrix shortening its operational life pap et al 2021 however a few pilot scale po4 3 adsorption systems have been reported in the literature namely a hybrid of copper modified chitosan beads combined with a dissolved air flotation process an et al 2019 a mobile pilot scale plant using amorphous calcium silicate hydrates okano et al 2016 and various processes using lanthanum based polymeric nanocomposites zhang et al 2021 iron oxide nanoparticle loaded chitosan composites kim et al 2018 iron coated sand granules lambert et al 2021 iron manganese oxy hydroxides aquaszero kalaitzidou et al 2016 and fe3o4 la oh 3 composites ahmed et al 2021 here the filtraflotm p reactor adsorber used together with a chitosan calcite adsorbent material ccm was implemented as a novel technology to recover po4 3 from wastewater treatment plant wwtp final effluent through a filtration adsorption process previously we reported using this ccm for po4 3 removal from synthetic aqueous solutions pap et al 2020b 2020a the filtraflotm p is a non commercial reactor which was developed by veolia for rapid gravitational filtration phosphorus adsorption for small scale use filtraflotm 2019 the ccm material can be synthesised using inexpensive and widely available waste material such as crab carapace or other exoskeleton shell material by scaling up this process to the multi kilogram scale and utilising it within a real wwtp setting this work aimed to provide a proof of concept for this technology the filtraflotm p unit employs enhanced gravitational filtration through an adsorption media with continuous self backwashing trials were designed to 1 assess how the filtraflotm p would operate under real wwtp conditions 2 ascertain the effectiveness of the ccm in recovering harvesting po4 3 from high p final effluent and 3 ascertain the effectiveness of the ccm in reducing effluent p to 1 mg l thus making the effluent compliant with eu discharge requirements for wwtp s discharging into sensitive areas at risk of eutrophication currently valid for wwtps of 10 000 p e furthermore a qualitative study using plants and pot trials was undertaken to consider the applicability of the saturated ccm adsorbent as a fertiliser product the novelty here lies in the holistic approach taken to address an emerging problem in the adsorption field few studies have undertaken pilot scale testing of a low cost adsorbent using real wwtp effluent utilised this saturated spent adsorbent in a relevant agricultural setting and fully assessed the chemical quality of the spent adsorbent in terms of co contaminants 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and analytical methods all reagents were of analytical grade and solutions were prepared using milli q water type i water merck direct 8

synthesis the parent material for the chitosan calcite adsorbent used here was brown crab cancer pagurus carapace the chitosan calcite adsorbent was created from the raw carapace through optimised thermochemical modification with deacetylation of the chitin chain in the presence of potassium hydroxide koh pap et al 2020a briefly raw carapace material was washed with tap water dried milled and sieved to 0 5 4 mm for example 1 kg of material was then mixed with koh solution impregnation ratio 0 1 kg koh kg raw material by weight the resulting impregnated material was then heated at 105 c for 150 min after cooling the resultant material was rinsed with milli q water to eliminate any by products or residues dried at 60 c for a further 2 h and then stored in plastic boxes the approximate calculated cost involved in production of this ccm was estimated at 0 561 us kg 561 us ton pap et al 2020b 2 3 pilot scale trials for po4 3 removal and recovery based on laboratory bench scale results pap et al 2020a the veolia water technologies filtraflotm p pilot reactor was tested using the ccm adsorbent at the scottish water horizons development centre at bo ness scotland in january february 2020 supplementary materials s2 fig s1 the centre is integrated into the bo ness wastewater treatment plant a fully operational municipal wwtp that routinely employs advanced biological treatment to remove p from wastewater the development centre facilitates the application of pilot scale plants to treat wastewater from the adjacent wwtp as effluent can be directly siphoned off as required from various stages within the wwtp process i e raw influent wastewater and primary secondary or final effluents for our trials we utilised only the secondary final effluent a 100 l filtraflotm p pilot reactor 1 2 m in height and 0 5 m in diameter made from 0 5 cm thick plastic was mounted on a wooden support housing box fig 1 a filtraflotm p employs enhanced gravitational filtration through a granular media here the developed ccm with continuous self backwashing the lower part of the reactor shaped as an inverted circular cone 15 l in size and 30 slope angle was designed to increase backwash efficiency the ccm granular adsorbent is shown in fig 1b the reactor is equipped with an air supported self backwashing system on the bottom to enable adsorbent recirculation fig 1c through this system the adsorbent from the bottom of the vessel can be airlifted using an entrained compressed air flow and reintroduced into the top of the reactor as well as increasing adsorption efficiency the backwashing helps to avoid compaction biofouling of the granular media four trials 1 4 were carried out at the wwtp during the first trial 1 the reactor column was filled to a 15 cm bed depth measured from the base of the cylindrical part with 11 kg of ccm granules particle size 0 5 4 mm these conditions were selected following preliminary lab experiments to maximise p adsorption capacity and efficiency for trials 2 4 the column was filled to 20 cm bed depth with 15 kg of ccm granules the reactor inlet valve which was fitted to the middle of the reactor fig s2a was connected with an accordion hose to feed inlet water secondary treated wastewater into the reactor this was supplied from an intermediate 1 m3 bulk container ibc fig s2b the inlet water was diffused downward into the middle of the adsorbent bed volume fig s3 another hoses were connected to the outlet at the top of the reactor to evacuate the filtered treated and high turbidity dirty water to a collection sewer fig s3 the dirty water been generated on the isolated top part red section on fig s3 of the reactor due to the adsorbent recirculation process all valves were manually operated when needed from the ibc tank the wastewater was pumped into the adsorption bed at 200 l h an mxv electric submersible pump caprari italy was used to convey water at the desired flowrate for each run once the adsorption bed was saturated with po4 3 the material was evacuated from the reactor manually and replaced with fresh adsorbent the point at which saturation occurred was established using measurements of p using a total phosphate tube test lovibond reagent set germany by measuring the inlet outlet po4 3 concentration at 2 h intervals the saturated ccm was stored on site in plastic boxes until the end of the trial period subsequently at the environmental research institute thurso the saturated ccm after trial 1 was dried at 105 c overnight prior to further analysis for the four trials e g low p 1 and 2 spiked high p 3 and 4 two were performed using low po4 3 concentrations 1 mg l and two with higher po4 3 concentrations spiked to 7 mg l within the ibc inlet tank other than the difference in the weight of adsorbent mass and the bed height in trial 1 all other process parameters were kept fixed between trials fig 2 shows the schematic of the pilot test process 2 4 wastewater effluent the typical composition of the secondary wastewater effluent used in the trials is shown in table 1 inlet samples were taken two times per day with every refill of the ibc tank outlet samples of about 1 l were taken from the reactor at 2 h intervals while running and ph conductivity turbidity po4 3 and cod were determined in the field after sampling aliquots of each sample were also filtered through 0 45 µm pore size nylon syringe filters fisher scientific uk for further analysis the aliquot for icp analysis was also stabilised acidified with ultra trace metal grade concentrated nitric acid hno3 immediately following filtration phosphate concentrations obtained on site using the total phosphate tube tests lovibond reagent set were only used to track the po4 3 breakthrough curves in the field these results were only considered indicative and were not standardised therefore they are not included in the manuscript 2 5 quality assessment of the saturated adsorbent a hno3 h2o2 extraction of samples of the saturated ccm adsorbent was used to determine total concentrations of target elements additionally milli q water and 2 citric acid extractions were also utilised to estimate the relative solubility of target elements methodological details on all three extractions are given in supplementary materials s3 table 2 shows a summary of the key conditions used for each of the three digestions extractions noted above triple super phosphate tsp obtained from pillaert meststoffen nv ghent belgium was chosen as a representative commercial fertiliser currently used in agriculture and was analysed alongside the saturated ccm as a fertiliser control regarding organic contaminants organochlorine oc pesticides polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs as the most representative of the persistent organic pollutants together with approximately 16 different common pharmaceuticals phcs were tested in the spent ccm more details on the organic assays are given in supplementary materials s4 2 6 microbiological assay given the pathogens regulated in the eu fertiliser regulations 2019 1009 table s1 testing was performed on spent ccm using selective differential media macconkey agar for enumeration of e coli total coliforms and enterococcus spp using a drop plate method with serial dilutions in addition spread plating of bacterial enrichments from the saturated ccm were used to assess presence absence of e coli coliforms salmonella spp and shigella spp while un enriched suspensions were used to carry out total viable microbial counts full methodological details on the microbiological assays are given in supplementary materials s4 2 7 characterisation of the saturated ccm adsorbent the saturated ccm after trial 1 was further characterised with different instrumental techniques for ccm morphology and surface elemental characteristics analysis we employed a jeol jsm 7800 f field emission scanning electron microscope fe sem using an accelerating voltage of 20 kv and an approximate beam current of 1 na energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx microanalysis utilised an oxford instruments x max 80 mm2 detector x ray powder

scofield relative sensitivity factors rsf were used and peaks were fitted using shirley background and gaussian 70 lorentzian 30 peak shapes 2 8 pot trials using the methods described in bogdan et al 2022 a pot trial was established to assess the p availability to plants of the ccm product tsp was utilised as a positive control while the omission of any fertilising product zero p was used as a negative control for the trial perennial ryegrass lolium perenne was grown on slightly acidic river sand ph 6 7 and an alkali artificial mineral substrate ph 8 5 3 results 3 1 phosphate recovery and water quality fig 3 a d shows the average phosphate concentrations in the influent and effluent and removal efficiency fluctuation during the four different trials for trial 1 and 2 fig 3a b the horizontal dotted lines show that after approximately 17 and 35 h running time the phosphate concentration of the effluent reached 0 5 mg l the regulatory limit for sensitive water bodies as set by the eu water framework directive wfd and us national pollution discharge elimination system npdes adsorption capacity increased approximately five fold from 300 mg kg and 363 mg kg in trials 1 and 2 to 1590 mg kg and 1859 mg kg in trials 3 and 4 the overall p recovery rate of the demonstrator during the trials was 50 fluctuations in effluent ph are shown in fig 4 a the initial ph of the wastewater influent was generally neutral and during the process the ph increased to 8 5 indicative of the alkali nature of the ccm phpzc 8 78 similarly the conductivity of the effluent reduced only slightly from an average value of 1450 μs cm fig 4b and overall the variation was negligible during the trials effluent turbidity increased during all the trials from 10 ntu fig 4c to 50 60 ntu see discussion fig s4a c in supplementary materials shows how these parameters evolved during the trials to determine the ability of the ccm to remove other nutrients beyond phosphate e g sulphate ton total oxidised nitrogen ammonium and organic matter expressed as cod and doc these parameters were also measured before and after the trials fig 5 a d additionally various macro mg ca k na and microelements al fe cu mn ni zn were monitored fig s5a d results revealed that small trace amounts of doc mg ni and k were released into the effluent while cod during trial 1 and 2 was also released some of the micro and macroelements e g ca cu fe mn and zn were removed in low quantities fig s5a d the concentration profiles for other parameters largely remained unchanged or only varied slightly during the trials it is worth noting that microelement concentrations in the influents were also low table 1 so no notable quantities of metals were adsorbed onto the ccm as was further confirmed with the quality analysis of the saturated ccm 3 2 instrumental characterisation of the saturated ccm xrd results for the saturated ccm are presented in fig s6 the main crystalline phase identified in the ccm was calcite with data matching well to the standard powder diffraction file in the international centre for diffraction data icdd database broad diffraction peaks around 9 6 and 19 were likely due to the presence of the chitosan polymer after a comparison with standard diffraction matrices for hydroxyapatite hap and brushite these compounds could also be identified on the phosphate saturated ccm surface fig s6 fig 6 a b shows the sem edx elemental mapping images and spectra respectively while table s2 shows the average elemental composition of the phosphate laden ccm adsorbent after the wastewater treatment the edx spectra confirmed high o 55 2 and ca 26 6 content due to calcite c 18 7 due to chitosan and the existence of p 1 0 adsorbed to the particles of the ccm other elements e g mg na k al could be present from the adsorbent itself or from the wastewater while the presence of au was attributed to the coating used during the sem edx analysis in order to improve image quality table s2 to determine the nature of c o n ca and p functional groups present and the adsorption mechanisms at play xps analysis of saturated ccm samples was carried out fig 7 a f fig 7a shows a survey scan for saturated ccm with surface elemental composition analysis indicated a surface composition of c 34 1 atomic o 45 4 atomic ca 10 7 atomic mg 4 3 atomic n 3 4 atomic and p 2 1 atomic which is slightly different to the edx results the three peaks at c1s were attributed to c h c c 284 78 ev c o 286 28 ev and o c o co3 289 28 ev lee et al 2021 due to the reaction of calcium with phosphate the peak for co3 289 28 ev was relatively weak the o1s band was composed of two sub bands fig 7c attributed to c o co3 531 18 ev and c o 532 58 ev since the calcium phosphate peak at o1s were close to 530 9 531 1 ev region which is in the range of the characteristic peak for carbonate co3 no characteristic p related peak could be detected on o1s ramola et al 2021 the n1s spectrum of the p saturated ccm fig 7d was deconvoluted at binding energies of 398 58 ev nh2 and 399 98 ev nh c n zhang et al 2018 the ca2p spectrum of p laden ccm contained a peak at 347 18 ev caco3 cahpo4 ca3 po4 2 this proves the existence of ca2 on the surface and thus possible ca2 phosphate interactions fig 7e samaraweera et al 2021 the peak at 133 58 ev from p2p fig 7f was also the result of several calcium phosphate compounds i e cahpo4 ca3 po4 2 zhang et al 2017 the composition in atomic from high resolution xps scans of the phosphate laden ccm adsorbent is shown in table s3 more detail on this ccm adsorbent and its characteristics can be found in pap et al 2020a 2020b 3 3 saturated ccm chemical quality results for the three extraction methods used to determine macroelement and microelement concentrations for the ccm are shown in table 3 and table 4 respectively in terms of organic compounds present very low concentrations of several organic contaminants e g o p dde p p dde and ddx polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs e g pcb 28 and pcb 52 and pharmaceuticals e g paracetamol were detected at the low µg kg level and far below current legislative limits for organo mineral products as listed in the legislative limit for who toxicity equivalents kg 1 dm of pcdd f13 more information about organic pollutants in ccm can be found in bogdan et al 2022 microbiological testing showed that there were no detectable target pathogens of concern as listed in eu fertiliser regulations 2019 1009 present in the saturated ccm table 5 un enriched suspensions utilising 25 g of the saturated ccm were also plated onto nutrient agar and incubated to assess general aerobic plate counts i e viable non target bacteria and fungi these returned positive growth for the saturated ccm indicating that some microorganisms likely fungi and bacterial spores were present further non target genomic analysis would be required to determine the specific species cultured 3 4 p availability in soil the amendment of a slightly acidic substrate with the ccm showed a beneficial effect on plant p uptake 3 3 0 8 mg p g dry wt in shoots when compared to an unfertilised control 0 12 0 02 mg p g dry wt fig s7 however using an alkali substrate plant p uptake in ccm fertilised pots reduced 0 38 0 13 mg p g dry wt and was only slightly higher than in unfertilised controls 0 20 0 03 mg p g dry wt fig s7 phosphorus uptake efficiency availability pue using the ccm after four months of ryegrass growth with two substrates was 10 2 river sand substrate and 1 1 0 4 alkali artificial mineral substrate time had a pronounced effect on p release from the ccm which indicated the slow release characteristics of the ccm bogdan et al 2022 4 discussion 4 1 pilot scale study and mechanism analysis the results from the phosphate adsorption trials indicated two quite different options for the filtraflotm p adsorber combined with the ccm adsorbent also the average effluent composition after each trial and the comparison with the regulation limits i e eu usa and china for the discharge showed in table s4 for further comparation as fig 3a b illustrates the ccm adsorbent was capable of removing phosphate even at low concentrations bringing residual phosphate levels below 0 5 mg l this shows its applicability in terms of efficient processing of low p effluents i e its potential for use in preventing eutrophication in sensitive receiving waters the clear difference in the phosphate adsorption patterns between trial 1 and 2 is almost certainly a result of the different ccm masses used in the filtraflotm p reactor in these 2 trials 11 kg vs 15 kg further the high phosphate concentration trials showed its high phosphate harvesting potential fig 3c d at higher phosphate concentrations on calcite rich surface it is proposed that the calcite will improve the microprecipitation formation of calcium phosphate phase and promote the growth of a calcium phosphate li et al 2017 the use of secondary wastewater effluent without residual suspended solids limited fouling of the adsorption bed from the results it can be estimated that with 15 kg of ccm approximately 20 m3 of wastewater could be filtered whilst harvesting phosphate further process optimisation related to the bed height in the reactor flow rate of the influent and granulation of the ccm adsorbent should be considered from the gathered data the amount of phosphate enriched ccm adsorbent material which could be produced would range approximately from 10 200 tons year wwtp from final effluent for wwtp s with capacities of 10 5 000 pe additionally the filtraflotm p is a mobile unit which can be easily transported by small truck and is readily installed therefore it has the potential to offer a compact labour saving option for phosphate recovery at rural remote areas e g farms and small wwtps the recovery of phosphate in these locations could mitigate surface runoff eutrophication with the additional benefit of that the saturated ccm can be used as a source of p in local production and consumption okano et al 2016 also developed a mobile pilot scale plant for p recovery the mobile pilot plant consisted of a 1000 l reactor a self made filtration system and ancillary equipment they assessed the ability of amorphous calcium silicate hydrates to recover phosphate from anaerobic sludge digestion liquor in this study the process did not drastically alter the ph of the treated effluent to extremely acid or alkaline it would not be necessary to regulate outlet water ph after a real water treatment scenario thus reducing the need for additional chemicals reagents and reducing operational costs at slight alkaline ph values on which the filtraflotm p ccm operates at ph 8 9 oh ions may interfere directly with phosphate adsorption this may be partially counteracted by favoured hydroxyapatite ca5 po4 3 oh and brushite cahpo4 precipitation on the ccm surface a microprecipitation mechanism pap et al 2022 another important removal mechanism was revealed due to the slightly increase in effluent ph since under these conditions ligand exchange whereby h2po4 and hpo4 2 anions replaced co3 2 on the ccm surface and formed inner sphere surface complexes via lewis acid base interactions between p and ca co3 groups zhang et al 2019 phosphate anions behave like lewis bases and can act as electron donors donating electron pairs by binding to ca atoms qu et al 2020 at the same time carbonate ions may be displaced into solution driving ph increases fig 4a the sharp increase in turbidity at the beginning of each trial could be due to smaller lighter adsorbent particles being washed out flowrates were 200 l h however after the initial wash of the adsorbent bed no significant loss of ccm was detected from the system after this stage the turbidity levels started to decrease again and stabilised at 10 times the influent values 50 60 ntu this could be connected with the recirculation process continuous self backwashing of the adsorbent and the main ccm phosphate removal mechanism namely the replacement of carbonate co3 2 ions these may then form salts with available mg na and k in the treated wastewater and thus increase turbidity kong et al 2019 therefore before discharge it would be desirable to integrate combine the filtraflotm p unit with further filtration e g slow sand filtration the sand filter would be used to retain the larger suspended solids and dissolved organic matter up to a certain concentration slow sand filtration is a cost effective and low energy technology it easily integrates with physico chemical filtraflotm p and biological processes for turbidity removal from wastewater verma et al 2017 patel et al 2022 2020 suggested an integration of different sand filters with waste biomass derived activated carbons to remove cod bod and tds from wastewater the cod indicative of organic compounds and ammonium removal may have additional benefits if this were to increase the organic carbon and nitrogen content of the loaded ccm wang et al 2020 assuming these organics are not undesirable harmful contaminants which is assessed in detail in the quality analysis section mg and k release could be explained by the material composition since the ccm adsorbent contains high levels of mg originating from the crab carapace itself and k from the activation with potassium hydroxide additionally k and mg could form complexes with organic compounds and solubilise additional benefits for the saturated ccm as potential fertiliser could be seen in the removal trends for metals i e ca cu fe mn and zn it is well known that alkaline earth and transition metals are essential elements in the soil environment shepherd et al 2016 these mineral nutrients can influence plant growth through both limitation and toxicity mn toxicity sometimes occurs in acid soils while alkaline soils are characterised by poor availability of fe cu mn and zn liu et al 2014 instrumental characterisation further confirmed the governing adsorption mechanisms for phosphate removal microprecipitation could be identified on the xrd pattern with the two vague peaks at 26 and 47 corresponding to hap hydroxyapatite and 31 5 for brushite implying that a ca p interaction occurred in the adsorbents fig s6 lin et al 2017 these reactions can occur under alkaline conditions according to equations 1 5 c a 2 3 h p o 4 2 4 o h c a 5 p o 4 3 o h 3 h 2 o h a p 2 c a 2 h p o 4 2 2 h 2 o c a h p o 4 2 h 2 o b r u s h i t e through element mapping fig 6a it is clear that the distribution of p in ccm after phosphate adsorption is closely related to ca based on above sem edx it can be confirmed that the phosphate adsorption by ccm is strongly correlated with the proportion of calcium present on the surface park et al 2018 furthermore xps study explored p chemical state and potential adsorption mechanisms in ccm after the wastewater treatment a strong p 2p peak was obtained for ccm fig 7f representing specific ca p interaction 133 58 ev through a ligand exchange inner sphere complexation these interactions can be expressed as 3 c

forming mononuclear bidentate surface complexes and one calcium centre forms mononuclear monodentate surface complexes liu et al 2019 mitrogiannis et al 2017 yang et al 2020 4 2 quality analysis and pot trials several key quality indicators for the ccm were assessed p content of the saturated ccm adsorbent ranged from 2 up to 7 p2o5 depending on the effluent phosphate content quality analysis indicated only trace levels well below legislative limits of heavy metals and organic pollutants and no detectable levels of target bacterial pathogens the trace levels of organic contaminants observed are to be expected given the organo mineral nature of ccm through chitin calcite chojnacka et al 2020 while the detection of paracetamol a painkiller on sub µg kg levels is almost certainly as a result of its widespread and frequent usage li et al 2021 taken together these quality data indicate that the saturated ccm adsorbent following use in wastewater treatment is a good candidate for use as a soil agriculture supplement the two solubility extractions e g water and 2 citric acid would also be expected to differ from each other and from the total fraction digests as the aqueous extracts used would not be expected to dissolve all product phases and each is instead used to simply estimate varying degrees of solubility i e to estimate fractions of elements likely to be more or less extractable or phytoavailable kabata pendias 2004 numerous aqueous extracts chemical solutions are employable for this purpose but in this case we simply selected water to estimate the proportion of elements most easily readily soluble in the products along with 2 citric acid as this has previously been used in other work more focussed on p availability wang et al 2012 weber et al 2014 in general results obtained for the products tested for macro and microelements are also compared to current legislative limits as stated within the eu fertilising products regulation fpr eu 2019 1009 in tables 3 and 4 in terms of potentially toxic elements both products were within the legislative limits also ccm product meet the key p2o5 requirements tables 3 and 4 showed total concentrations mg kg dry weight of elements and mineral oxide values in comparison to current relevant eu legislative limits given in eu fertilising products regulation fpr eu 2019 1009 ccm showed a beneficial effect on plant growth p concentration in shoots and slow release kinetics when compared to the unfertilised controls during the pot trials based on the pot trials and the ccm characteristics 2 5 p2o5 it can be compared to other commercial soil conditioners available on market it should however be noted that a direct comparison between commercial products and ccm as a soil conditioners is only indicative because of the different p2o5 content different route to the market i e the price 561 us ton is for the adsorbent production and not the final price for the saturated material and ccm have other beneficial characteristics such as increase in soil organic matter content and texture buffer against soil acidification and chitin chitosan has antibacterial properties furthermore the p2o5 content of ccm could be increased up to 7 if the filtraflotm p reactor if deployed to a rural area e g on farm and fed with a high phosphate effluent 4 3 general consideration crab carapace is composed mainly of calcite and chitin and is a common waste by product from the seafood industry worldwide millions of tons are created wasted annually most of which is disposed of in landfill lu et al 2007 re purposing such waste into a value added product i e as a p adsorbent and potential soil amendment could provide multiple agricultural benefits including increased soil organic matter content improved physical soil properties texture provision of essential plant nutrients and buffering through caco3 content against soil acidification caused by nitrogen application in addition chitin chitosan has antibacterial properties which may in turn support rhizobial multiplication by biologically controlling root pathogenic organisms nekvapil et al 2021 pap et al 2020a if we consider the recycling pathways to adsorbent fertilising product the formulation proposed refers to a possible product function category pfc according to the wording in the eu fertilising products regulations eu 2019 1009 the list of animal by products abp and derived products to be included under compound material category cmc n 10 is currently under definition crab carapace belonging to category 3 k i shells from shellfish with soft tissue or flesh of abp regulation ec 1069 2009 might be added provided the abp end point is achieved however due to the interaction of the adsorbent with wastewater ccm requires an extensive qa qc before it could be included in cmc 10 the recycling of ccm also can occur under existing national legislation a further benefit of a ccm adsorbent is that it can be applied to land without further processing or after milling to powder using existing soil application machinery it is an alternative to sewage sludge or manure spreading and can act as a general soil improver targeted users are primarily local farmers for fertilisation of agricultural land but also technical services within municipalities or private enterprises for landscaping works a limiting factor may be that the seasonality of agricultural use may not coincide with the production cycle of the ccm necessitating storage however if the ccm adsorbent is mixed with other organic fertilisers the storage units of those products could be used and therefore there would be a priori no limiting factor for this use factors in support of this pathway include the direct use of ccm with an elevated p and ca content and several additional soil improvement properties adding organic carbon k and texture additionally waste repurposing is utilised creating circular links with the fishery and seafood industries this approach is highly consistent with the principles of a sustainable circular economy whereby re use or recycling of waste materials is optimised to extract their maximum value fig 8 shows the main stakeholders that may be involved in the recycling pathways ploteau et al 2021a 2021b 5 conclusion a pilot scale adsorption system was developed for in situ phosphate recovery at a bo ness wwtp the main conclusions here are high phosphate removal recovery was achieved during the trials even at low phosphate concentrations bringing the residual p level below 1 mg l the eu limit for sensitive water bodies the slightly increased turbidity noted in treated water e g likely due to magnesium and potassium carbonates may require integration combination of the filtraflo m p unit with slow sand filtration the results showed that the filtraflo m p unit with ccm could serve as a water polishing unit with low phosphate concentration effluents or as a phosphate harvesting unit where phosphate concentrations were high surface microprecipitation and ligand exchange were postulated as key phosphate adsorption mechanisms through xrd sem edx and xps analysis quality assessment of the p enriched ccm was based on elemental composition macro nutrients and heavy metals microbiological evaluation and quantification of organic micropollutants this indicated 2 5 p2o5 trace levels well below legislative limits of heavy metals i e cu co and organic pollutants e g pcbs and paracetamol and no detectable levels of target bacterial pathogens a pot trial was conducted at ghent university to examine p availability of ccm on different substrate during a 4 month growth of perennial ryegrass the results showed that ryegrass plants treated with the ccm adsorbent achieved higher plant dry matter and p concentration compared to the unfertilised control overall this study has demonstrated a fully integrated approach assessing the feasibility of laboratory scale to pilot scale

15278,there is a critical need to use decentralized and or point of use systems to address some challenging water quality issues in society sorption based approaches are uniquely suitable for such applications because of their simplicity in operation however the sorbents must possess fast contaminant uptake kinetics to overcome short hydraulic contact times often encountered in small systems here we designed a two sorbent system consisting of fe2o3 coated mesoporous carbon femc and nano fe2o3 coated activated carbon feac and demonstrated its ability to remove arsenate with a 1 min empty bed contact time ebct by a capture and storage process batch experiments showed rapid capture of arsenate by femc likely occurred on the rod like structures protruding to the liquid film the captured arsenate could subsequently be relocated to feac for storage which had a higher apparent sorption capacity column studies operated with a 10 h running time followed by a 14 h pump off time showed that with a 102 μg as l influent concentration and at 0 85 min ebct the column treated 20 022 bed volumes until the 10 μg as l breakthrough corresponding to a sorption density of 2 36 mg as g this capture and storage technique resulted in a rapid and high capacity arsenate removal through a combined effect of facile access to sorption sites on one sorbent and dynamic equilibrium in the two sorbent

managed drinking water by 2030 counting at 2 billion in 2020 un 2016 despite continuous efforts arsenic as contamination in drinking water remains a thorny issue jamil et al 2019 especially in areas using private wells ctdph 2021 gross and brown 2020 smith et al 2018 in 2021 the connecticut department of public health reported that 3 9 of private wells statewide had as concentrations over the maximum contamination level mcl 10 μg l ctdph 2021 modern municipal drinking water treatment plants in developed and urban regions are usually equipped to control as occurrence hering et al 2017 but in the developing world and some remote and rural areas centralized water treatment infrastructure is not always available decentralized and or point of use pou water treatment unit is therefore a choice for these populations flanagan and brown 2017 gross and brown 2020 jamil et al 2019 neumann et al 2013 rodríguez lado et al 2013 schaefer et al 2016 sorption is an effective technique to remove as moraga et al 2019 ribeiro et al 2021 sorg et al 2021 westerhoff et al 2005 to scale up a fixed bed adsorber column test is widely used to assess sorbent performance under changing contaminant concentration and hydrodynamic conditions hu et al 2015 zeng et al 2008 the empty bed contact time ebct calculated as the bed volume divided by the volumetric flow rate is a parameter affecting the breakthrough curve cui et al 2015 and fractional use of the sorption capacity at breakthrough liu et al 2014 a long equilibration time of up to days could normally ensure as transport to and adsorb on a sorbent s active sites some of which likely exist in intraparticle micropores di iorio et al 2018 farrell and chaudhary 2013 however for decentralized and or pou sorption devices the ebct is often quite short for example the ebct of easy to use household water filters is as short as 1 min bang et al 2005 möller et al 2009 this makes it extremely difficult to meet the 10 μg as l breakthrough goal zeng et al 2008 as the arsenic removal is controlled by the kinetics rather than the sorption capacity of the sorbent alone one limitation is the inaccessibility of arsenate as v oxyanions to the deeper sorption sites of porous sorbents in flow through conditions due to the slow intraparticle diffusion badruzzaman et al 2004 since in normal residential uses water flows intermittently through a sorption device a system can be potentially designed to allow contaminant re distribution through interparticle diffusion during the pump off time recently a mixed medium approach has been conceptualized by coupling a fast sorbing sorbent with a high capacity sorbent wang et al 2021 the first sorbent captures as v rapidly when the pump is on but the captured contaminant could relocate to the second sorbent in the system for storage during the pump off periods conceptually this mass re equilibrium process wang et al 2021 is intriguing and could be valid to address the kinetic constraint the approach however has not been studied by long term column tests at environmentally relevant as v concentrations i e μg as l influent level and very short ebcts this study aimed to design a new medium by mixing two iron based carbonaceous materials possessing different sorption characteristics to overcome the mass transfer constraint for as v transport under the flow through condition many materials were developed for as v removal including iron based hybrid anion exchanger sarkar et al 2010 zero valent iron neumann et al 2013 polymer iron oxide nanofiber composite peter et al 2017 and iron based metal organic frameworks wang et al 2019a carbonaceous materials a family that consists of powdered granular activated carbon activated carbon felts mesoporous carbon biochar carbon nanotube carbon quantum dots graphene etc have vast diversity based on their different particle size porosity texture and surface chemistry as such carbon materials are often tailored and applied to create new engineering systems they can also be regenerated in the same manner for reuse in this study an iron oxide coated mesoporous carbon containing rod like structure was used to capture as v at an extremely rapid rate the captured contaminant would be relocated to the second sorbent in the mix for storage which was the nano iron oxide coated activated carbon possessing a high capacity the sorption efficacy of this mixed medium was demonstrated showing a strikingly high sorption density in the column test with 1 min ebct investigations with dialytic diffusion experiments demonstrated the potential of relocation of as v from one sorbent material to the other as we hypothesized this capture and storage technique capitalizes on the after hours operation to maximize the overall as v removal in consistency with a day night shift in residential uses badruzzaman et al 2004 cui et al 2015 westerhoff et al 2005 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals ultrapure water 18 2 mω

within 5 when checked regularly with the standards separate glass reactors were used for different time points in kinetic experiments one set of kinetics experiments lasted for 1200 s with initial concentrations at 49 9 51 4 μg as l we selected this initial concentration range because this was likely the prevalent as exposure concentration as demonstrated by a study reporting that only 8 out of 65 well water samples collected across the united states have concentrations higher than 50 μg as l sorg et al 2014 we added 10 mg solids into 10 ml of as v solutions in 50 ml beakers and mixed the

utilize the mass re equilibrium process the columns were operated at a 10 h on and 14 h off mode each day this operation generally matches a day night shift for residential uses badruzzaman et al 2004

a previously reported protocol wang et al 2021 briefly 30 mg of fe15mc was saturated with 30 ml as v solution 22 5 mg as l then the saturated fe15mc together with 0 2 ml as v solution as carryover

dialytic diffusion test was 59 2 ml ph at 6 7 and ionic strength at 50 mm after magnetically mixing for 14 h a liquid sample solution ii was taken for measuring the recovery each sorbent was collected by vacuum filtration through a 0 45 μm membrane and naoh solution 20 ml 0 5 m was used to extract as v from solid samples for as analysis wang et al 2021 a control experiment was included with a dialysis tube containing no fe51ac 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of sorbents the characteristics of unmodified carbons mc and ac and carbons coated with iron oxides fe15mc and fe51ac are shown in figs 1 2 and s2 s5 tem revealed a rod like structure for unmodified mc fig 1a and iron coated material fe15mc fig 1b the fe2o3 coating was found on the rod like regions of fe15mc figs 1c e and did not significantly reduce the pore volume 0 630 cm3 g for mc and 0 552 cm3 g for fe15mc sem images displayed the porous structure of an fe15mc grain fig s2a b the presence of mesopores was also shown in fig s3 the rod like structure with large porosity li et al 2016 is expected to increase the sorption site accessibility at the exterior surface that favors the fast uptake of as v fe l and o k edges were shown in the raw eels spectrum fig 1f of fe15mc the fe l 3 l 2 intensity ratio was 5 44 calculated from the second derivative spectrum suggesting the prevalence of fe iii cosandey et al 2012 klie and browning 2002 this is consistent with the observed fe 2p 3 2 peak centered at 711 7 ev for fe iii bonnissel gissinger et al 1998 mcintyre and zetaruk 1977 in the xps spectrum fig s4b the 2θ peak of 33 2 in the xrd pattern fig s5 was indexed to the 104 reflection of hematite α fe2o3 and 35 6 to the 110 reflection hrtem microanalyses confirmed the fe2o3 form on the rod like

upon iron coating treatment ac s larger pore volume could better host fe nanoparticles inside its carbon structure fig 2b d both eels fig 2e fe l 3 l 2 intensity ratio 5 44 and xps fig s4d the fe 2p 3 2 peak at 711 1 ev spectra suggested the prevalence of fe iii in fe51ac in the xrd pattern fig s5 the peaks at 2θ of 30 2 35 6 57 3 and 62 9 were consistent with the reflections of maghemite γ fe2o3 a single fe2o3 nanoparticle embedded in the carbon framework had a lattice interplanar distance of 0 297 nm fig 2f corresponding to the 220 plane the concentric rings in the saed fig 2g suggested the polycrystalline nature of the fe2o3 with each ring assigned to a set of maghemite planes the fe2o3 nanoparticles in fe51ac congregated on ac fig s2g l had a size of approximately 20 30 nm in diameter fig 2d and f due to significant pore blocking by the coated fe2o3 nanoparticles the total pore volume and specific surface area of fe51ac were greatly reduced from 1 02 to 0 198 cm3 g and from 650 to 75 1 m2 g respectively 3 2 arsenate sorption kinetics batch experiments showed that an initial 50 μg as l level aqueous concentration was reduced to 3 5 μg as l in 30 s by fe15mc and to 4 4 μg as l in 90 s by fe51ac fig 3 a the high rates of removal suggested both materials are capable sorbents for as v but fe15mc could clearly capture as v much faster due to its higher specific surface area over fe51ac 313 versus 75 1 m2 g larger pore volume 0 552 versus 0 198 cm3 g the presence of relatively larger mesopores i e 30 nm pore diameter 50 nm fig s3 and potentially the rod like structure the coated fe2o3 was clearly seen on the rod like structure fig 1d and the carbon matrix fig s2e of fe15mc the kinetic data were fit by the pseudo first order kinetics intraparticle diffusion and liquid film diffusion models to implicate the corresponding kinetic characteristics a recent study demonstrated that the pseudo second order fitting results would be unfairly favored when sorption experimental data are collected close to or in equilibrium simonin 2016 in light of this understanding we did not employ the pseudo second order kinetic model the equation of the pseudo first order model is taken as liu et al 2014 1 ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t where qe is the sorption density μg g at equilibrium q t the density μg g or mg g at time t min and k 1the rate constant min 1 the linear fit of l n q e q t versus t fig 3b resulted in a first order rate constant of 3 83 min 1 for fe15mc r2 0 928 and 1 51 min 1 for fe51ac r2 0 971 taking account of the known specific surface area 313 m2 g for fe15mc and 75 1 m2 g for fe51ac and solid loading 1 0 g l the specific surface area normalized rate constant is calculated to be 0 012 l min 1 m 2 for fe15mc and 0 020 l min 1 m 2 for fe51ac which fall in the same order of magnitude the kinetic performance of our materials well competes with some nanomaterials as as v sorbent previous studies reported the same normalized rate constant is 0 013 l min 1 m 2 for magnetite nanoparticles yang et al 2010 0 028 l min 1 m 2 for nanoscale zerovalent fe kanel et al 2006 and 0 023 l min 1 m 2 for zno nanoparticle yang et al 2010 under circumneutral ph conditions they are comparable to fe15mc and fe51ac for the granular ferric hydroxide banerjee et al 2008 a sorbent on the market it was one order of magnitude smaller 0 0012 l min 1 m 2 at ph 6 5 to reveal the importance of diffusion of as v oxyanions in the sorption process we fit the data with intraparticle diffusion kim et al 2004 yu et al 2009 and liquid film diffusion boyd et al 1947 gupta and bhattacharyya 2011 models using the following two equations 2 q t k i p d t 1 2 3 ln 1 q t q e k lfd t herein k i p d is the intraparticle diffusion rate constant s 1 and klfd the liquid film diffusion rate constant μg g 1 s 0 5 the physical meanings of q t t and q e are given in eq 1 in accordance with zero intercept the successful modeling requires the fitted straight lines plots of q t versus t 1 2 in fig 3c for eq 2 and ln 1 q t q e versus t in fig 3d for eq 3 to pass through the origin the intraparticle diffusion model cannot fit the data for fe15mc because the intercept value is 29 3 whereas the liquid film diffusion model could fit the data for both fe15mc r2 0 974 and fe51ac r2 0 990 a failure in fitting with the intraparticle diffusion model fig 3c but a feasible fitting with the liquid film diffusion model fig 3d suggested the latter would be relatively important for fe15mc this was possibly due to the rod like structure fig 1 that protrudes from the grain periphery into the liquid film nearby to capture a perceptible fraction of as v considering the readily accessible sorption sites on the rod like regions the uptake rate would be therefore facilitated regarding fe51ac the intraparticle diffusion and liquid film diffusion models can fit the data well which suggested that both were important for fe51ac the rate limiting step for each of the two sorbents could not be determined in this study the 24 h sorption kinetics data fig 3e showed that when compared with fe15mc the as v uptake by fe51ac was lower initially but became higher eventually a high initial concentration 22 5 mg as l was used in these tests leading to a sorption plateau in 2 h for fe15mc and 15 h for fe51ac the two sorbents are intentionally designed to possess distinguishable sorption characteristics the observation of the lower plateau of fe15mc will be explained in the next section 3 3 arsenate sorption isotherms the unmodified mc and ac had negligible as v sorption capacity both 0 3 mg as g when tested with a 20 7 mg as l as v solution the iron oxide coating greatly increased the as v sorption with the sorption capacity at 16 0 mg as g fe15mc and the apparent sorption capacity the maximum sorption density at 22 4 mg as g fe51ac fig 4 a the freundlich isotherm foo and hameed 2010 q e m c e 1 n m and n are freundlich capacity and linearity parameters respectively was able to fit the sorption data for all materials in high and low aqueous concentration conditions fig 4 with close to unity r2 for most cases table s3 and fig s6 but the langmuir isotherm did not fit the data well for fe15mc r2 0 677 data not shown the langmuir model could be derived from the assumption of homogeneous sorption sites with respect to sorption energy in the freundlich model 1 n closer to zero indicates greater surface heterogeneity foo and hameed 2010 haghseresht and lu 1998 as such the isotherm fitting outcome suggests fe15mc 1 n 0 161 in freundlich fit and poor langmuir fit has more heterogeneous sorption sites than fe51ac 1 n 0 840 in freundlich fit good langmuir fit with r2 0 936 data not shown in addition the smaller 1 n value suggests a broader site energy distribution xing and pignatello 1997 and more high energy sites carter et al 1995 which could favor the sorption of solute at lower aqueous concentrations carter et al 1995 despite fewer sorption sites than fe51ac as v sorption on fe15mc was favorable at lower concentrations higher equilibrium concentrations i e mg l level in constructing isotherms for sorption capacity may not be relevant to practical cases where total as concentrations of the tainted waters are normally less than 100 μg as l chen et al 2020 sorg et al 2014 to determine sorption densities under practical conditions isotherm data at lower i e μg l level concentrations were collected the sorption capability of the mixed medium of fe15mc and fe51ac at a mass ratio of 1 2 fell between the individual materials observed from their isotherms fig 4b at a specific as v aqueous concentration the sorption density of the mixed medium approximated the mass weighted average of the individual materials indicating that the two materials had no sorption interference with each other in thermodynamic equilibrium before the mixed medium system reached equilibrium in the batch studies as v is likely inclined to bind more to fe15mc due to its faster sorption kinetics but this remains to be investigated 3 4 column studies with the capture and storage process revealed by the individual studies of the two materials fe15mc is favorable in its faster sorption kinetics and fe51ac in its higher apparent sorption capacity we hypothesized that within the mixed medium fe15mc could rapidly sorb as v from water in the capture phase and the captured as v could be relocated to the fe51ac portion for storage thus freeing sorption sites on fe15mc for further capture in the next cycle we first examined if the sorption enhancement of the mixed medium occurred relative to fe51ac alone in the column test at ebct of about 0 8 min and a 10 μg as l breakthrough the mixed medium column achieved 20 022 bed volumes and sorption density of 2 36 mg as g and the fe51ac alone column did 14 406 bed volumes and 1 55 mg as g figs 5 a and s7 the mixed medium thus increased the sorption capacity by 52 compared to fe51ac even though the apparent sorption capacity of fe51ac alone was significantly higher fig 4a the mixed medium is advantageous to both individual materials when taking account of sorption efficacy and material cost because while fe15mc has a faster sorption kinetics the mc s cost per gram is more than two thousand times higher than ac 45 00 g versus 0 02 g on the market the mixed medium s sorption performance is also competitive with other novel as v sorbent materials working at near neutral phs and with short ebcts 0 5 1 1 min at the 10 μg as l breakthrough as v sorption density was reported to be 1 4 mg as g for an iron hydroxide preloaded activated carbon influent concentration 60 5 μg as l jang et al 2008 2 0 mg as g for a granular ferric hydroxide influent concentration 62 0 μg as l westerhoff et al 2008 1 8 mg as g for the bayoxide e33 influent concentration 62 0 μg as l westerhoff et al 2008 and 0 96 mg as g for a granular titanium dioxide influent concentration about 700 μg as l cui et al 2015 all of which were lower than the mixed medium of this study in addition the mixed medium column outperformed the fe51ac alone column at a higher influent as v concentration 23 2 mg as l fig s8 one would expect that a column packed with fe15mc only would perform better because of its fast kinetics however using mc alone at this point would be cost prohibitive 45 00 g compared to fe15mc with higher sorption density than fe51ac at low concentration the mixed medium had comparable sorption density at the equilibrium concentration of 10 μg as l fig 4b and could be operated at a short 1 min ebct in the column test the sorbent is quasi saturated with as v when breakthrough is observed therefore the sorption density q in mg as g in the column test is compared with that measured in the sorption isotherm experiment given that the column breakthrough concentration equals the isotherm equilibrium concentration for the mixed medium and fe51ac the sorption density in the column test was consistently larger than that in the isotherm test at the same aqueous as v concentration at μg as l level suggesting more intraparticle diffusion of as v had occurred in the column the extra intraparticle diffusion amounts of the columns for the mixed medium δ q 1 and fe51ac δ q 2 is estimated using the following equations 4 δ q 1 q m i x e d m e d i u m c o l u m n h q e i m i x e d m e d i u m 5 δ q 2 q f e 51 ac c o l u m n h q e i f e 51 a c where q c o l u m n h is the column sorption density mg as g at the breakthrough of h μg as l and q e i the sorption density mg as g at the equilibrium concentration of i μg as l that is predicted by the freundlich model as the breakthrough concentration increased from 10 to 50 μg as l δ q 1 increased from 0 530 to 0 650 mg as g and δ q 2 from 0 494 to 0 680 mg as g items 11 15 in fig 5b suggesting both materials obtained more adequate usage through the column setup the extra intraparticle diffusion is attributable to the extra time given by the pump off periods cui et al 2015 li and sengupta 2000 sengupta 2017 westerhoff et al 2005 for the mixed medium if we assume independent intraparticle diffusion processes of fe15mc and fe51ac the extra intraparticle diffusion quantity occurring on fe15mc could be approximated as 6 δ q δ q 1 2 3 δ q 2 where 2 3 is the mass fraction of fe51ac in the mixed medium in general the resulting value decreased as the breakthrough concentration increased items 16 20 in fig 5b it suggested that fe51ac acted as the more active as v receptor during the interparticle diffusion in the pump off periods and relocation of as v from fe15mc to fe51ac had occurred we sought direct evidence for this relocation through the dialytic diffusion experiment fig 5c a thorough mass balance analysis showed 28 1 μg as relocated from fe15mc to fe51ac whereas the control group retained more as v on fe15mc 240 μg as than the experimental 220 μg as fig 5d this suggested that a thermodynamic driving force exists from the fe15mc sorbed as v to the fe51ac sorption sites specifically as v desorbed from the saturated fe15mc first and then the desorbed as v in the solution diffused through the dialysis tube and bound to fe51ac which in turn further promoted the desorption of as v in the fe15mc as such the mixed medium combined the advantage of fe15mc in its fast sorption kinetics and that of fe51ac in its high apparent sorption capacity and tackled the disadvantage of each material through the relocation scheme the relocation process can also be considered as an in situ regeneration process for fe15mc the fast sorbing material wang et al 2021 the overall picture is demonstrated in fig s9 in the pump on period 10 h of a cycle as v was mostly captured by fe15mc from the feeding water because of its rapid sorption kinetics in the pump off period 14 h net migration of as v from fe15mc to fe51ac occurs freeing sorption sites on fe15mc for as v capturing in the next cycle fe15mc is thus moderately regenerated in the pump off phase the as v solid phase concentration gradient at the grain periphery is correlated to the as v uptake rate into the material sengupta 2017 the relocation process could further level off the concentration gradient during the pump off period for some fe15mc grains immediately after the pump resumption the regenerated fe15mc was endowed with a greater solid phase concentration gradient for as v removal 4 conclusions to conclude there are sorbents that have rapid sorption kinetics for as v but may be too costly for practice uses there are also sorbents that are cheap and have a fairly large sorption capacity however the sorption kinetics is too slow for applications in small water treatment units this study illustrates the potential of a mixed sorption medium fe15mc and fe51ac that could remove as v rapidly at a high capacity and at the same time at a reasonable cost the capture and storage sorption process is proposed the long term 44 days column test with ebct at 51 s was conducted for evaluating the performance of the capture and storage approach resulting in treatment of 20 022 bed volumes at 10 μg as l breakthrough the high sorption density of 2 36 mg g in the hydrodynamic flow through condition may make the approach amenable for small systems the mixed medium sorption approach could be further optimized by considering the disparity in sorption kinetics and capacity between the two sorbents and by incorporating the cost information associated with the acquisition regeneration and disposal of each sorbent to evaluate practicality further work is needed to study the influence of natural anions e g silicate and phosphate and or natural organic matter on the capture and storage approach last but not least one of the two sorbents could be made magnetic so once the column reaches saturated the mixed medium could be easily separated by a magnet and the storage material regenerated for reuse an example of the

15278,there is a critical need to use decentralized and or point of use systems to address some challenging water quality issues in society sorption based approaches are uniquely suitable for such applications because of their simplicity in operation however the sorbents must possess fast contaminant uptake kinetics to overcome short hydraulic contact times often encountered in small systems here we designed a two sorbent system consisting of fe2o3 coated mesoporous carbon femc and nano fe2o3 coated activated carbon feac and demonstrated its ability to remove arsenate with a 1 min empty bed contact time ebct by a capture and storage process batch experiments showed rapid capture of arsenate by femc likely occurred on the rod like structures protruding to the liquid film the captured arsenate could subsequently be relocated to feac for storage which had a higher apparent sorption capacity column studies operated with a 10 h running time followed by a 14 h pump off time showed that with a 102 μg as l influent concentration and at 0 85 min ebct the column treated 20 022 bed volumes until the 10 μg as l breakthrough corresponding to a sorption density of 2 36 mg as g this capture and storage technique resulted in a rapid and high capacity arsenate removal through a combined effect of facile access to sorption sites on one sorbent and dynamic equilibrium in the two sorbent

managed drinking water by 2030 counting at 2 billion in 2020 un 2016 despite continuous efforts arsenic as contamination in drinking water remains a thorny issue jamil et al 2019 especially in areas using private wells ctdph 2021 gross and brown 2020 smith et al 2018 in 2021 the connecticut department of public health reported that 3 9 of private wells statewide had as concentrations over the maximum contamination level mcl 10 μg l ctdph 2021 modern municipal drinking water treatment plants in developed and urban regions are usually equipped to control as occurrence hering et al 2017 but in the developing world and some remote and rural areas centralized water treatment infrastructure is not always available decentralized and or point of use pou water treatment unit is therefore a

as moraga et al 2019 ribeiro et al 2021 sorg et al 2021 westerhoff et al 2005 to scale up a fixed bed adsorber column test is widely used to assess sorbent performance under changing contaminant concentration and hydrodynamic conditions hu et al 2015 zeng et al 2008 the empty bed contact time ebct calculated as the bed volume divided by the volumetric flow rate is a parameter affecting the breakthrough curve cui et al 2015 and fractional use of the sorption capacity at breakthrough liu et al 2014 a long equilibration time of up to days could normally ensure as transport to and adsorb on a sorbent s active sites some of which likely exist in intraparticle micropores di iorio et al 2018 farrell and chaudhary 2013 however for decentralized and or pou sorption devices the ebct is often quite short for example the ebct of easy to use household water filters is as short as 1 min bang et al 2005 möller et al 2009 this makes it extremely difficult to meet the 10 μg as l breakthrough goal zeng et al 2008 as the arsenic removal is controlled by the kinetics rather than the sorption capacity of the sorbent alone one limitation is the inaccessibility of arsenate as v oxyanions to the deeper sorption sites of porous sorbents in flow through conditions due to the slow intraparticle diffusion badruzzaman et al 2004 since in normal residential uses water flows intermittently through a sorption device a system can be potentially designed to allow contaminant re distribution through interparticle diffusion during the pump off time recently a mixed medium approach has been conceptualized by coupling a fast sorbing sorbent with a high capacity sorbent wang et al 2021 the first sorbent captures as v rapidly when the pump is on but the captured contaminant could relocate to the second sorbent in the system for storage during the pump off periods conceptually this mass re equilibrium process wang et al 2021 is intriguing and could be valid to address the kinetic constraint the approach however has not been studied by long term column tests at environmentally relevant as v concentrations i e μg as l influent level and very short ebcts this study aimed to design a new medium by mixing two iron based carbonaceous materials possessing different sorption characteristics to overcome the mass transfer constraint for as v transport under the flow through condition many materials were developed for as v removal including iron based hybrid anion exchanger sarkar et al 2010 zero valent iron neumann et al 2013 polymer iron oxide nanofiber composite peter et al 2017 and iron based metal organic frameworks wang et al 2019a carbonaceous materials a family that consists of powdered granular activated carbon activated carbon felts mesoporous carbon biochar carbon nanotube carbon quantum dots graphene etc have vast diversity based on their different particle size porosity texture and surface chemistry as such carbon materials are often tailored and applied to create new engineering systems they can also be regenerated in the same manner for reuse in this study an iron oxide coated mesoporous carbon containing rod like structure was used to capture as v at an extremely rapid rate the captured contaminant would be relocated to the second sorbent in the mix for storage which was the nano iron oxide coated activated carbon possessing a high capacity the sorption efficacy of this mixed medium was demonstrated showing a strikingly high sorption density in the column test with 1 min ebct investigations with dialytic diffusion experiments demonstrated the potential of relocation of as v from one sorbent material to the other as we hypothesized this capture and storage technique capitalizes on the after hours operation to maximize the overall as v removal in consistency with a day night shift in residential uses badruzzaman et al 2004 cui et al 2015 westerhoff et al 2005 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals ultrapure water 18 2 mω

utilize the mass re equilibrium process the columns were operated at a 10 h on and 14 h off mode each day this operation generally matches a day night shift for residential uses badruzzaman et al 2004

single fe2o3 nanoparticle embedded in the carbon framework had a lattice interplanar distance of 0 297 nm fig 2f corresponding to the 220 plane the concentric rings in the saed fig 2g suggested the polycrystalline nature of the fe2o3 with each ring assigned to a set of maghemite planes the fe2o3 nanoparticles in fe51ac congregated on ac fig s2g l had a size of approximately 20 30 nm in diameter fig 2d and f due to significant pore blocking by the coated fe2o3 nanoparticles the total pore volume and specific surface area of fe51ac were greatly reduced from 1 02 to 0 198 cm3 g and from 650 to 75 1 m2 g respectively 3 2 arsenate sorption kinetics batch experiments showed that an initial 50 μg as l level aqueous concentration was reduced to 3 5 μg as l in 30 s by fe15mc and to 4 4 μg as l in 90 s by fe51ac fig 3 a the high rates of removal suggested both materials are capable sorbents for as v but fe15mc could clearly capture as v much faster due to its higher specific surface area over fe51ac 313 versus 75 1 m2 g larger pore volume 0 552 versus 0 198 cm3 g the presence of relatively larger mesopores i e 30 nm pore diameter 50 nm fig s3 and potentially the rod like structure the coated fe2o3 was clearly seen on the rod like structure fig 1d and the carbon matrix fig s2e of fe15mc the kinetic data were fit by the pseudo first order kinetics intraparticle diffusion and liquid film diffusion models to implicate the corresponding kinetic characteristics a recent study demonstrated that the pseudo second order fitting results would be unfairly favored when sorption experimental data are collected close to or in equilibrium simonin 2016 in light of this understanding we did not employ the pseudo second order kinetic model the equation of the pseudo first order model is taken as liu et al 2014 1 ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t where qe is the sorption density μg g at equilibrium q t the density μg g or mg g at time t min and k 1the rate constant min 1 the linear fit of l n q e q t versus t fig 3b resulted in a first order rate constant of 3 83 min 1 for fe15mc r2 0 928 and 1 51 min 1 for fe51ac r2 0 971 taking account of the known specific surface area 313 m2 g for fe15mc and 75 1 m2 g for fe51ac and solid loading 1 0 g l the specific surface area normalized rate constant is calculated to be 0 012 l min 1 m 2 for fe15mc and 0 020 l min 1 m 2 for fe51ac which fall in the same order of magnitude the kinetic performance of our materials well competes with some nanomaterials as as v sorbent previous studies reported the same normalized rate constant is 0 013 l min 1 m 2 for magnetite nanoparticles yang et al 2010 0 028 l min 1 m 2 for nanoscale zerovalent fe kanel et al 2006 and 0 023 l min 1 m 2 for zno nanoparticle yang et al 2010 under circumneutral ph conditions they are comparable to fe15mc and fe51ac for the granular ferric hydroxide banerjee et al 2008 a sorbent on the market it was one order of magnitude smaller 0 0012 l min 1 m 2 at ph 6 5 to reveal the importance of diffusion of as v oxyanions in the sorption process we fit the data with intraparticle diffusion kim et al 2004 yu et al 2009 and liquid film diffusion boyd et al 1947 gupta and bhattacharyya 2011 models using the following two equations 2 q t k i p d t 1 2 3 ln 1 q t q e k lfd t herein k i p d is the intraparticle diffusion rate constant s 1 and klfd the liquid film diffusion rate constant μg g 1 s 0 5 the physical meanings of q t t and q e are given in eq 1 in accordance with zero intercept the successful modeling requires the fitted straight lines plots of q t versus t 1 2 in fig 3c for eq 2 and ln 1 q t q e versus t in fig 3d for eq 3 to pass through the origin the intraparticle diffusion model cannot fit the data for fe15mc because the intercept value is 29 3 whereas the liquid film diffusion model could fit the data for both fe15mc r2 0 974 and fe51ac r2 0 990 a failure in fitting with the intraparticle diffusion model fig 3c but a feasible fitting with the liquid film diffusion model fig 3d suggested the latter would be relatively important for fe15mc this was possibly due to the rod like structure fig 1 that protrudes from the grain periphery into the liquid film nearby to capture a perceptible fraction of as v considering the readily accessible sorption sites on the rod like regions the uptake rate would be therefore facilitated regarding fe51ac the intraparticle diffusion and liquid film diffusion models can fit the data well which suggested that both were important for fe51ac the rate limiting step for each of the two sorbents could not be determined in this study the 24 h sorption kinetics data fig 3e showed that when compared with fe15mc the as v uptake by fe51ac was lower initially but became higher eventually a high initial concentration 22 5 mg as l was used in these tests leading to a sorption plateau in 2 h for fe15mc and 15 h for fe51ac the two sorbents are intentionally designed to possess distinguishable sorption characteristics the observation of the lower plateau of fe15mc will be explained in the next section 3 3 arsenate sorption isotherms the unmodified mc and ac had negligible as v sorption capacity both 0 3 mg as g when tested with a 20 7 mg as l as v solution the iron oxide coating greatly increased the as v sorption with the sorption capacity at 16 0 mg as g fe15mc and the apparent sorption capacity the maximum sorption density at 22 4 mg as g fe51ac fig 4 a the freundlich isotherm foo and hameed 2010 q e m c e 1 n m and n are freundlich capacity and linearity parameters respectively was able to fit the sorption data for all materials in high and low aqueous concentration conditions fig 4 with close to unity r2 for most cases table s3 and fig s6 but the langmuir isotherm did not fit the data well for fe15mc r2 0 677 data not shown the langmuir model could be derived from the assumption of homogeneous sorption sites with respect to sorption energy in the freundlich model 1 n closer to zero indicates greater surface heterogeneity foo and hameed 2010 haghseresht and lu 1998 as such the isotherm fitting outcome suggests fe15mc 1 n 0 161 in freundlich fit and poor langmuir fit has more heterogeneous sorption sites than fe51ac 1 n 0 840 in freundlich fit good langmuir fit with r2 0 936 data not shown in addition the smaller 1 n value suggests a broader site energy distribution xing and pignatello 1997 and more high energy sites carter et al 1995 which could favor the sorption of solute at lower aqueous concentrations carter et al 1995 despite fewer sorption sites than fe51ac as v sorption on fe15mc was favorable at lower concentrations higher equilibrium concentrations i e mg l level in constructing isotherms for sorption capacity may not be relevant to practical cases where total as concentrations of the tainted waters are normally less than 100 μg as l chen et al 2020 sorg et al 2014 to determine sorption densities under practical conditions isotherm data at lower i e μg l level concentrations were collected the sorption capability of the mixed medium of fe15mc and fe51ac at a mass ratio of 1 2 fell between the individual materials observed from their isotherms fig 4b at a specific as v aqueous concentration the sorption density of the mixed medium approximated the mass weighted average of the individual materials indicating that the two materials had no sorption interference with each other in thermodynamic equilibrium before the mixed medium system reached equilibrium in the batch studies as v is likely inclined to bind more to fe15mc due to its faster sorption kinetics but this remains to be investigated 3 4 column studies with the capture and storage process revealed by the individual studies of the two materials fe15mc is favorable in its faster sorption kinetics and fe51ac in its higher apparent sorption capacity we hypothesized that within the mixed medium fe15mc could rapidly sorb as v from water in the capture phase and the captured as v could be relocated to the fe51ac portion for storage thus freeing sorption sites on fe15mc for further capture in the next cycle we first examined if the sorption enhancement of the mixed medium occurred relative to fe51ac alone in the column test at ebct of about 0 8 min and a 10 μg as l breakthrough the mixed medium column achieved 20 022 bed volumes and sorption density of 2 36 mg as g and the fe51ac alone column did 14 406 bed volumes and 1 55 mg as g figs 5 a and s7 the mixed medium thus increased the sorption capacity by 52 compared to fe51ac even though the apparent sorption capacity of fe51ac alone was significantly higher fig 4a the mixed medium is advantageous to both individual materials when taking account of sorption efficacy and material cost because while fe15mc has a faster sorption kinetics the mc s cost per gram is more than two thousand times higher than ac 45 00 g versus 0 02 g on the market the mixed medium s sorption performance is also competitive with other novel as v sorbent materials working at near neutral phs and with short ebcts 0 5 1 1 min at the 10 μg as l breakthrough as v sorption density was reported to be 1 4 mg as g for an iron hydroxide preloaded activated carbon influent concentration 60 5 μg as l jang et al 2008 2 0 mg as g for a granular ferric hydroxide influent concentration 62 0 μg as l westerhoff et al 2008 1 8 mg as g for the bayoxide e33 influent concentration 62 0 μg as l westerhoff et al 2008 and 0 96 mg as g for a granular titanium dioxide influent concentration about 700 μg as l cui et al 2015 all of which were lower than the mixed medium of this study in addition the mixed medium column outperformed the fe51ac alone column at a higher influent as v concentration 23 2 mg as l fig s8 one would expect that a column packed with fe15mc only would perform better because of its fast kinetics however using mc alone at this point would be cost prohibitive 45 00 g compared to fe15mc with higher sorption density than fe51ac at low concentration the mixed medium had comparable sorption density at the equilibrium concentration of 10 μg as l fig 4b and could be operated at a short 1 min ebct in the column test the sorbent is quasi saturated with as v when breakthrough is observed therefore the sorption density q in mg as g in the column test is compared with that measured in the sorption isotherm experiment given that the column breakthrough concentration equals the isotherm equilibrium concentration for the mixed medium and fe51ac the sorption density in the column test was consistently larger than that in the isotherm test at the same aqueous as v concentration at μg as l level suggesting more intraparticle diffusion of as v had occurred in the column the extra intraparticle diffusion amounts of the columns for the mixed medium δ q 1 and fe51ac δ q 2 is estimated using the following equations 4 δ q 1 q m i x e d m e d i u m c o l u m n h q e i m i x e d m e d i u m 5 δ q 2 q f e 51 ac c o l u m n h q e i f e 51 a c where q c o l u m n h is the column sorption density mg as g at the breakthrough of h μg as l and q e i the sorption density mg as g at the equilibrium concentration of i μg as l that is predicted by the freundlich model as the breakthrough concentration increased from 10 to 50 μg as l δ q 1 increased from 0 530 to 0 650 mg as g and δ q 2 from 0 494 to 0 680 mg as g items 11 15 in fig 5b suggesting both materials obtained more adequate usage through the column setup the extra intraparticle diffusion is attributable to the extra time given by the pump off periods cui et al 2015 li and sengupta 2000 sengupta 2017 westerhoff et al 2005 for the mixed medium if we assume independent intraparticle diffusion processes of fe15mc and fe51ac the extra intraparticle diffusion quantity occurring on fe15mc could be approximated as 6 δ q δ q 1 2 3 δ q 2 where 2 3 is the mass fraction of fe51ac in the mixed medium in general the resulting value decreased as the breakthrough concentration increased items 16 20 in fig 5b it suggested that fe51ac acted as the more active as v receptor during the interparticle diffusion in the pump off periods and relocation of as v from fe15mc to fe51ac had occurred we sought direct evidence for this relocation through the dialytic diffusion experiment fig 5c a thorough mass balance analysis showed 28 1 μg as relocated from fe15mc to fe51ac whereas the control group retained more as v on fe15mc 240 μg as than the experimental 220 μg as fig 5d this suggested that a thermodynamic driving force exists from the fe15mc sorbed as v to the fe51ac sorption sites specifically as v desorbed from the saturated fe15mc first and then the desorbed as v in the solution diffused through the dialysis tube and bound to fe51ac which in turn further promoted the desorption of as v in the fe15mc as such the mixed medium combined the advantage of fe15mc in its fast sorption kinetics and that of fe51ac in its high apparent sorption capacity and tackled the disadvantage of each material through the relocation scheme the relocation process can also be considered as an in situ regeneration process for fe15mc the fast sorbing material wang et al 2021 the overall picture is demonstrated in fig s9 in the pump on period 10 h of a cycle as v was mostly captured by fe15mc from the feeding water because of its rapid sorption kinetics in the pump off period 14 h net migration of as v from fe15mc to fe51ac occurs freeing sorption sites on fe15mc for as v capturing in the next cycle fe15mc is thus moderately regenerated in the pump off phase the as v solid phase concentration gradient at the grain periphery is correlated to the as v uptake rate into the material sengupta 2017 the relocation process could further level off the concentration gradient during the pump off period for some fe15mc grains immediately after the pump resumption the regenerated fe15mc was endowed with a greater solid phase concentration gradient for as v removal 4 conclusions to conclude there are sorbents that have rapid sorption kinetics for as v but may be too costly for practice uses there are also sorbents that are cheap and have a fairly large sorption capacity however the sorption kinetics is too slow for applications in small water treatment units this study illustrates the potential of a mixed sorption medium fe15mc and fe51ac that could remove as v rapidly at a high capacity and at the same time at a reasonable cost the capture and storage sorption process is proposed the long term 44 days column test with ebct at 51 s was conducted for evaluating the performance of the capture and storage approach resulting in treatment of 20 022 bed volumes at 10 μg as l breakthrough the high sorption density of 2 36 mg g in the hydrodynamic flow through condition may make the approach amenable for small systems the mixed medium sorption approach could be further optimized by considering the disparity in sorption kinetics and capacity between the two sorbents and by incorporating the cost information associated with the acquisition regeneration and disposal of each sorbent to evaluate practicality further work is needed to study the influence of natural anions e g silicate and phosphate and or natural organic matter on the capture and storage approach last but not least one of the two sorbents could be made magnetic so once the column reaches saturated the mixed medium could be easily separated by a magnet and the storage material regenerated for reuse an example of the

15279,application of heterogeneous advanced oxidation processes aops for wastewater treatment suffers from the low oxidant utilization efficiency slow catalytic cycling and severe matrix interference herein we report that amorphous zirconium dioxide azro2 a redox inert metal oxide can efficiently activate peroxymonosulfate pms to degrade organic micropollutants under very low oxidant doses and complex coexisting matrices distinct from conventional aops where radicals are formed the surface zr iv pms complex was identified as the principal reactive species and primarily conducted oxygen atom transfer route with selected molecules quantitative structure activity relationship analysis indicated that the formation of zr iv pms complex was governed by the density of the surface hydroxyl groups the strong interaction between the zr atom and pms caused the deviation of the negative charge from zr iv metal sites to the oxidant as a result the o o bond of the adsorbed pms was prolonged and its oxidation potential elevated which enabled it to directly react with contaminants this study indicates the potential of azro2 as a novel and eco friendly catalyst that activates pms to selectively tackle organic contaminants and sheds light on the designing of fenton like catalysts using redox inert metals graphical abstract image graphical abstract a novel redox inert metal oxide amorphous zirconium dioxide azro2 is surprisingly capable of highly efficient decontamination through peroxymonosulfate pms activation the activity of azro2 in cbz degradation is 5 1 to 72 0 times higher than the conventional transition metal oxides the surface zr iv pms complex was identified as the principal reactive species and primarily conducted oxygen atom transfer route with selected

oxidation processes aops which rely on the generation of extremely reactive and thus highly unstable radical species e g so4 oh etc from certain redox active chemicals e g h2o2 pms have become state of the art water treatment technologies for the elimination of organic micropollutants hodges et al 2018 li et al 2020 zhang et al 2022 various strategies such as energy input e g heat uv wen et al 2022 carbon based materials duan et al 2014 transition metals chen et al 2022 yang et al 2019 etc can be used to activate the oxidants to generate these reactive radical species among these approaches transition metals with variable valent states and unoccupied 3d orbitals such as fe co mn cu etc are generally regarded as the most effective activators guo et al 2021 ren et al 2020b xu et al 2021 transient metals can promote the decomposition of oxidants to radicals through the mn m n 1 redox cycling during which the reduction of m n 1 to mn is usually the rate limiting step guo et al 2022 hodges et al 2006 song et al 2022 meanwhile the reduction of high valent metal species comes with the cost of oxidants decomposition without generating highly reactive radicals eqs 1 and 2 thus lowering the utilization efficiency of oxidants lyu et al 2018 mi et al 2022 therefore an economical and high efficient metal catalyst that does not depend on its redox cycling is highly desired 1 m

unique merits of low toxicity easy synthesis strong stability and excellent biocompatibility chen et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 applications of zro2 in wastewater treatment have been reported for example zro2 especially amorphous zro2 can act as the absorbent to remove anions in water such as fluoride pan et al 2013 arsenate moraga et al 2019 and phosphate su et al 2013 because they can strongly complex to the zr sites note that in heterogeneous fenton like oxidation processes the first step is usually the complexation between the transient metals and the oxidant anions e g hso5 s2o8 2 ho2 hu et al 2017 li et al 2021 nevertheless owing to the redox inert nature of zro2 little attention has been paid to its potential catalytic activity in fenton like reaction processes so far the application of zro2 in aops is limited to its role of an inert carrier of catalysts yin et al 2021 recent studies indicated that zro2 could activate h2o2 to generate radicals for example ziolek et al reported that d0 transition metal oxides e g zro2 ta2o5 nb2o5 with acidic base surface functional groups could induce the decomposition of h2o2 to generate radicals ziolek et al 2015 unlike conventional fenton like processes no interfacial electron transfer occurred in this process sobańska et al 2017 further found that amorphous zro2 azro2 showed peroxidase like activity at ph iep eq 3 it could decompose h2o2 to form oh and o2 at ph iep however it showed catalase like eq 4 activity that decomposed h2o2 to o2 in the proposed mechanism the electrons were only transferred from the h2o2 in the bulk solution to the adsorbed ho2 during this process the azro2 served as an ionic sponge where the charged o2 and o2 2 species and protons could be stabilized and accumulated on the surface our recent study has also demonstrated that the abundant hydroxyl groups on the surface of azro2 could induce the intermolecular electron transfer thereby promoting the production of ho2 o2 yin et al 2021 such a pathway does not involve the redox reaction of the zr metals which is distinct from conventional fenton like processes and would greatly increase the utilization efficiency of oxidants however these studies are still in their infancy and only few studies on glycerol oxidation have been reported sobańska et al 2017 it is still unclear whether it can be used to degrade organic contaminants in wastewater the key reactive species and the intrinsic mechanisms also remain ambiguous which deserves further investigations 3 ho 2 ads h 2 o 2 aq o h aq o 2 ads h 2 o 4 h 2 o 2 aq 1 2

azro2 activated pms complex zr iv pms rather than free radicals was identified as the principal reactive species in the azro2 pms system dft computation was employed to rationalize the mechanisms of

systems for singlet oxygenation and radicals generation are summarized in text s5 chen et al 2021 the dft theoretical calculations were simulated in the vienna ab initio simulation package vasp the computational details are described in text s6 supporting information 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of amorphous and crystalline zro2 fig 1 a shows the xrd patterns of azro2 and czro2 the azro2 shows no obvious peaks and pattern suggesting an amorphous structure the czro2 exhibits a mixed crystal character consisting of monoclinic phase jcpds 37 1484 and tetragonal phase jcpds 50 1089 the hrtem and saed images are consistent with the xrd data fig 1e g no lattice fringe and crystalline signal can be observed in the azro2 sample while distinct 110 011 fringes corresponding to monoclinic and tetragonal phases as well as some bright dots are evident in the czro2 sample the sem images fig s2 reveal a fluffy appearance for both azro2 and czro2 the tem images fig 1d f show that the amorphous structure of azro2 became ordered after calcination the average size of the czro2 powder is 24 79 nm determined by the size distribution histogram fig 1h the stem element mapping fig 1i indicates the uniform distribution of zr and o in the azro2 particles ft ir and xps analysis revealed the functionalities on the surface of azro2 and czro2 in the ft ir spectrum of azro2 fig 1b the adsorption peak at 1348 cm 1 can be assigned to the deformation vibration of zr oh zhang et al 2019 the peaks at 3351 and 1633 cm 1 can be ascribed to the hydroxyl stretching and bending vibrations of the water molecules adsorbed on the surface su et al 2013 the intensities of these peaks were dramatically lower for the czro2 sample indicating the surface of czro2 was less hydroxylated the o 1s spectra in xps analysis point to a similar conclusion fig 1c table s3 the amount of surface anchored hydroxyl groups 531 6 ev was up to 56 0 for azro2 but the value for czro2 was only 20 7 the position of zr 3d5 2 peak of azro2 182 28 ev shifted toward lower binding energy by 0 26 ev compared with czro2 fig s3 which could be associated with the coordination defects and oxygen vacancies of amorphous metal oxides shan et al 2020 tga analysis again suggested that azro2 had a large amount of adsorbed water and terminal hydroxyl groups on the surface fig s4 moreover the specific surface areas ssa of azro2 fig s5 was calculated to be 954 53 m2 g 1 more than 18 times greater than that of czro2 52 99 m2 g 1 3 2 catalytic activities of azro2 and czro2 the catalytic activities of azro2 and czro2 were evaluated by the degradation of cbz figs 2 a and s6 show that neither of them could serve as the catalyst of pds and h2o2 cbz was degraded by less than 3 in the pds and h2o2 systems regardless of the presence or absence of zro2 in contrast 39 4 and 93 8 of cbz were degraded in the czro2 pms and azro2 pms systems in 15 min and the pseudo first order rate constants k obs were determined to be 0 0303 and 0 2011 min 1 respectively fig s7 an examination of the residual oxidants fig s8 served as an additional evidence of the higher catalytic activity of azro2 only 35 4 of pms in solution was decomposed in the czro2 pms system but it was completely decayed in the azro2 pms system the activity of azro2 in terms of catalyzing pms to degrade cbz was compared with several commercial metal oxides including fe2o3 co3o4 mn3o4 fe3o4 and cuo under the same reaction conditions catalyst 0 5 g l pms 0 1 mm ph 3 0 the sources and properties of these metal oxide are listed in table s4 it can be clearly seen in fig 2b that the azro2 has significantly higher activity than the other metal oxides with the k obs value 5 1 to 72 0 times higher fig s9 the activity of azro2 was also compared with those of the heterogeneous catalysts reported in literature recently here a reactivity index k value defined by normalizing the apparent reaction rate constant by the pms dose was used for comparison table s5 in details qian et al 2021 as displayed in fig 2c the azro2 pms system has a k value of 2 011 min 1 mm 1 2 3 to 86 7 times higher than the reported catalysts figs s10 and s11a show the degradation of cbz at varying pms azro2 and initial ph levels a positive relationship can be found between the rate of cbz degradation and the azro2 dose fig s10e the influence of pms on the degradation is more complicated the k obs showed a volcano like shape with the change of the pms dose fig s10f increasing ph suppressed the degradation of cbz fig s11a possibly due to the reduced electrostatic interaction between the catalyst and the negatively charged pms hso5 pk a 9 4 or neutral cbz molecules pk a 13 9 huang and zhang 2019 the details are discussed in text s7 azro2 remained rather stable with the leaching of zr4 less than 70 μg l 1 at ph 2 5 7 0 fig s11b thus avoiding the secondary pollution for real water bodies besides fig s11c demonstrates that dissolved zr4 at such a level had negligible contribution to the degradation of cbz the degradation of cbz in the azro2 pms system was not or little affected by the water matrices including organic matter fig s12a b various inorganic anions cl so4 2 no3 and cations na k ca2 mg2 fig 2d h2po4 was found to suppress the reaction significantly and the underlying mechanism will be discussed later in this article the performance of the azro2 pms was also tested in real water and wastewater matrices results show that over 80 of cbz was removed in 30 min fig 2e with nearly 40 toc removal in 90 min fig s12c except ba nb and atz the other selected compounds containing the electron donating groups such as och3 oh and ch3 xie et al 2022 zong et al 2021 were significantly degraded in the azro2 pms system with the abatement ratios ranging from 71 4 to 100 fig 2d the reason for the unsatisfied removal of ba nb and atz could be the existence of electron withdrawn groups in their molecular structures including no2 cooh and other groups xie et al 2022 zong et al 2021 the high selectivity of the azro2 pms system towards electron rich contaminants implies that it may not work through a free radical oxidation mechanism 3 3 identification of reactive oxygen species usually oh and so4 are the reactive species in activated pms systems hodges et al 2018 huang et al 2022 jia et al 2021 however cbz degradation in the azro2 pms system was unlikely due to these radical species fig 3 a b show that the presence of methanol meoh or tert butanol t buoh at 10 mm showed a marginal effect on cbz degradation further increasing the quenching agent concentrations to 100 mm scavenger pms molar ratio 1000 1 only slightly suppressed cbz degradation k obs from 0 20 to 0 17 min 1 no singles corresponding to hba and bq which could be generated from the oxidation of ba and hba by radicals could be detected during the oxidation process fig 3c d dong et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 in addition no signals of these radicals were detected in epr analysis fig 3e the contribution of o2 to cbz degradation was also ruled out adding the quenching agents of o2 i e chloroform chcl3 1 0 mm and benzoquinone p bq 1 0 mm showed no adverse affect on cbz degradation figs 3b and s13a also not only was there no specific signal at 532 nm for the reaction of nbt with o2 fig s14 but the dmpo o2 peak was not monitored fig 3e moreover 1o2 has been demonstrated ineffective in degrading cbz with a second order reaction rate constant less than 106 m 1 s 1 li et al 2018 considering the first order rate constant for 1o2 reacting with h2o is 2 5 105 s 1 the contribution of 1o2 if formed would be minor text s8 further epr analysis solvent d2o exchange experiment and photoexcited rose bengal rb system clearly strengthened the above conclusions figs s15 s17 text s9 for details in metal activated pms oxidation system the initiation step is generally the formation of an immediate metal peroxide complex m ooso3 hu et al 2017 li et al 2021 in this system the o o bond of zr iv ooso3 complex if formed did not undergo further cleavage to give rise to reactive oxygen species ross thus we hypothesize that the reactive zr iv pms complex per se reacted with cbz fig s18a shows that mixing pms and azro2 in advance remarkably accelerated the removal of cbz because pre mixing allowed the formation and accumulation of the reactive zr iv pms complex in the solution the longer the premixing time was the more significant of the acceleration was formation of zr iv pms complex also explains the degradation of cbz even after free pms was depleted in the solution as illustrated in fig s18b the pms concentration rapidly declined to under detection limit after 5 min but the removal of cbz did not cease the presence of cbz also significantly accelerated the decomposition of pms in solution fig s18c which was also in well accordance with the characteristics of a reactive complex dominated system duan et al 2018 ren et al 2020a in fact the zr iv pms complex is relatively stable and can be separated from the solution fig s19a shows that the total pms concentration reduced from 1 0 mm to 0 86 mm after mixing with 1 0 g l azro2 for 5 min however only 0 66 mm pms was measured in the bulk solution it implies that the rest 0 20 mm pms was complexed to the surface of azro2 then the azro2 in the solution was reclaimed by filtration the pms concentration associated with the filtered azro2 was determined to be 0 16 mm data not shown reasonably matching the loss of pms in the solution more importantly the reclaimed azro2 alone was capable to degrade cbz as shown in fig 4 a the cbz 42 3 μm was abated by approximate 20 after mixing with the reclaimed azro2 for 15 min in contrast the removal was 1 3 by equal quantity of azro2 without pms pre treatment fig s19b by adding potassium iodide ki as a pms quencher which greatly interrupted pollutant degradation the cbz oxidation by the surface bound pms complex was further confirmed fig s20 si et al 2022 electrochemical tests revealed more insights into the interactions between azro2 pms and cbz the i t test using azro2 coated fto glass electrode showed negligible current output upon cbz addition fig s21a indicating no reaction occurred between cbz and the azro2 however the addition of pms generated a current surge fig s21b and injecting cbz afterwards resulted in another current surge fig s21b interestingly the dosage of cbz could lead to the elevation of current density on the filtered azro2 coated electrode fig s21c these observations collectively indicates that reactions occurred between azro2 and pms probably forming a zr iv pms complex which could degrade cbz ren et al 2020a the lsv curves corroborate the above speculation the current slightly increased in the presence of pms and then greatly increased after further introduction of cbz fig s21d 3 4 characterized the zr iv pms complex atr ftir and confocal raman spectrum were employed to characterize the interfacial interactions between pms and azro2 as shown in fig 4b the azro2 sample in water exhibited a broad peak at 3096 cm 1 which can be attributed to the o h stretching of the surface hydroxyl groups υ oh zhang et al 2013 in general the broad peak of oh stretching arises from intramolecular hydrogen bonds if it becomes narrow it suggests less hydrogen bonds either because of less adjacent oh groups or the negative charge center shifts toward the opposite direction of the h atom after the addition of pms this peak narrowed and redshifted by 178 cm 1 in the azro2 pms system indicating the decrease in electron cloud intensity of surface oh groups resulted from the interaction between azro2 and pms mi et al 2022 it can be rationalized by the increase of electron withdrawing capacity of the bonded zr possibly arising from the partial charge deviation from metal sites to pms zhang et al 2013 accordingly the appearance of the characteristic s o stretching vibration of hso5 at 1240 cm 1 in the azro2 pms system and its red shift 8 cm 1 compared to that of pms alone again served as the evidence of the strong binding between h o o so3 and azro2 thus the atr ftir results demonstrated the replacement of surface oh by hso5 to bond with the metal sites the complexation between azro2 and pms is an inner sphere coordination because changing the ionic strengths of the reaction solution from 10 to 100 mm showed negligible effect on cbz degradation fig s22 zhang et al 2013 zhao et al 2022 in situ confocal raman spectrum further corroborated the strong interfacial interaction between pms and azro2 and the details were shown in fig s23 high resolution xps spectrum of the azro2 before and after mixing with pms was shown in fig s24 the appearance of the s 2p signal indicates the adsorption of s containing species on the surface fig s24a this peak can be deconvoluted to two subpeaks corresponding to so4 2 169 0 ev and hso5 170 1 ev fig s24b moreover the o1s peak denoting the portion of the adsorbed oxygen 531 6 ev increased from 56 0 to 70 7 after mixing with pms and slightly decreased to 67 0 after the reaction with cbz fig s24c the overall increase in adsorbed oxygen might be attributed to the adsorption of hso5 and so4 2 on the azro2 meanwhile the binding energy of the zr3d5 2 increased 0 38 ev after the addition of pms fig s24d indicating a decreased electron cloud density on the zr atoms likely because of the replacement of electron rich surface hydroxyl groups anchored on the zr atoms by hso5 h2po4 has been demonstrated to show a high affinity toward zr metals by forming a strong zr o p coordination bond qiu et al 2020 it can compete with pms for the surface binding sites on the azro2 thereby preventing the formation of zr iv pms complex ft ir analysis revealed fig s25a a characteristic peak at 1014 cm 1 belonging to h2po4 in the azro2 pms h2po4 system xia et al 2012 whereas the peaks attributed to pms disappeared furthermore the broad peak centered at 3419 cm 1 shrank dramatically in the presence of h2po4 demonstrating the replacement of surface hydroxyl groups by h2po4 zhang et al 2008 zhang et al 2013 in the presence of 1 0 mm h2po4 the decomposition efficiency of cbz and pms markedly decreased by 29 3 and 17 8 respectively further increasing h2po4 concentration to 5 0 mm almost completely inhibited the degradation of cbz and moreover the abatement of pms also greatly reduced fig s25b c this serves additional evidence that the zr iv pms complex played a central role in the degradation of cbz 3 5 factors governing the reaction rate to identify the key factors governing the formation of the zr iv pms complex a series of azro2 x with similar amorphous phase fig s26 but varying ssa pore volumes and hydroxyl contents figs 4c and s27 were synthesized and their catalytic activities were evaluated figs 4d and s28 the results in fig 4e show a positive linear relationship between the hydroxyl group contents on the azro2 x θ calculated as azr oh ao 100 eq 5 and the apparent degradation rate constants k obs of cbz in the azro2 x pms systems in contrast the correlation between the pore volume of the azro2 x and k obs was weak r 2 0 366 fig s29 ssa also appeared to be unessential to the catalytic activity r 2 0 679 fig s30 based on the above data the density of the surface hydroxyl groups is the key factor determining the catalytic activity of azro2 the czro2 possessed a lower surface hydroxyl group density 20 7 fig 4c than the azro2 x which explains its lower catalytic activity k obs 0 0308 min 1 fig 4d it is worth noting that the amount of pms adsorbed q was also linearly related to the quantity of the hydroxyl groups on the azro2 x fig s31a c eq 6 thus the degradation of cbz was governed by the quantity of pms complexed on the azro2 particles fig s31d eq 7 in other words the zr iv pms complex played a critical role in cbz degradation the isoelectric point of the azro2 is 5 45 fig s32 at ph 5 45 the hydroxyl groups oh are protonated and positively charged thereby facilitating the adsorption of the hso5 anion and the formation of the zr iv pms complex 5 k obs 0 0062 0 0012 θ 0 0586 0 0431 r 2 0 879 6 q 2 5427 0 7130 θ 48 6839 23 5855 r 2 0 802 7 k obs 0 0025 0 0002 q 0 1878 0 0291 r 2 0 974 3 6 other properties of the reactive complex distinct from free radical oxidation the zr iv pms is highly selective and reacts with organic compounds through oxygen atom transfer pathway as a result the utilization efficiency of pms is significantly higher and the degradation products are different from the radical oxidation systems the pms utilization efficiency defined as the amount of cbz oxidized by each μmol of pms eq 8 of the azro2 pms system was 0 397 μmol one order of magnitude higher than those in the activated pms oxidation systems where free radical oxidation is dominant for instance the values in the pms oxidation systems catalyzed by lacoo3 guo et al 2020 fe3o4 deng et al 2017 and mos2 zhou et al 2020 are 0 0568 0 0466 and 0 035 μmol respectively for cbz degradation the high pms utilization efficiency is not only because of the selectivity of the zr iv pms but due to the avoidance of pms consumption during the reduction of m n 1 to mn that occurred in the radicals dominated systems eq 2 8 pms utilization efficiency the amount of oxidized cbz pms consumption the azro2 pms system exhibits high selectivity and reacts with organics through an oxygen atom transfer pathway for example atz that can be decomposed rapidly in uv pms system a well accepted radicals based system k so4 atz k oh atz 3 0 109 m 1 s 1 appeared highly persistent in the azro2 pms system fig s17 shao et al 2018 pmso was effectively removed in both azro2 pms and uv pms systems fig s17 no pmso2 production was observed in pms alone system fig 5 a however 89 2 of the removed pmso was transformed to methyl phenyl sulfone pmso2 in the azro2 pms system fig 5b d while hydroxylated products m z 157 03021 m h were formed in the uv pms system fig 5d formation of pmso2 is indicative of an oxygen atom transfer pathway li et al 2021 because pmso2 could not be degraded by azro2 pms fig 5e other pathways if existed only had a contribution less than 10 8 li et al 2022 2021 notably due to the inherent molecular orbital properties of zirconium metal this oxygen atom transfer pathway can not originate from the existence of high valent zirconium which has not been reported so far in any fields it was well known that the high valent metal species could undergo the oxygen atom exchange oae reaction with h2 18o zong et al 2021 here the 18o labeled pms16o18o product m z 159 0360 m h retention time 9 45 min was produced from the reaction of pms16o and fe iv o fe ii hclo process in h2 18o matrix fig s33a whereas no pms16o18o signal was detected in the azro2 pms system fig s33b further excluding the contribution of high valent metal species the difference in the degradation mechanisms between azro2 pms and uv pms systems was also evidenced by a comparism of degradation products of cbz as shown in fig s34 and table s6 the azro2 pms system led to the formation of 2 hydroxyacridine 9 carbaldehyde p10 1 1 bis 2 formylphenyl urea p11 and 9 hydroxyacridine 10 9h carboxamide p12 and some unidentified intermediates that were not observed in the uv pms system in contrast acridine 9 carbaldehyde p8 was generated in the uv pms system but was not found in the azro2 pms system the results suggest the different pathways of cbz degradation in the two systems further studies are need to assess the toxicities of the products in the different systems 3 7 validating the mechanism by dft computation the formation of the zr iv pms complex and its role in cbz degradation are further rationalized by molecular simulation based on density functional theory dft the corresponding adsorption energies e ads and average o o bond lengths l o o of pms molecules before and after adsorption are displayed in table s7 one can see that azro2 has a higher adsorption energy toward pms molecule 1 056 ev fig 6 b than czro2 0 749 ev fig 6a the higher affinity is ascribed to the deficient coordination numbers of zr 6 at the adsorption sites of the amorphous zro2 compared with the normal coordination numbers in crystals 7 shan et al 2020 in fact the defective coordination behavior has been widely recognized in amorphous oxides mavracic et al 2018 after surface hydroxylation the formation of intermolecular hydrogen bonds further increases the adsorption energy to 1 745 ev fig 6c which not only favors the zr iv pms formation but induces a negative charge deviation from zr metal sites to pms fig 6d f thereby boosting the oxidation potential of the zr iv pms complex based on the above data and interpretations the reaction mechanism can be proposed for the degradation of cbz in the azro2 pms system fig 6g first the zr iv pms complex was formed via the substitution of surface hydroxyl groups by pms anions eq 9 the strong binding but moderate electron transfer between azro2 and pms prevented the complexes from heterolytic cleavage to form ross instead the zr iv pms complex attacked selected molecules through an oxygen atom transfer pathway eq 10 the high oxidizing potential of zr iv pms was due to the prolonged peroxide o o bond fig 6a c table s7 caused by the attraction of electron cloud from pms to the zr atoms such an azro2 induced non radical pathway endows the system a competitive advantage over the radical triggered pathway with respect to the following aspects i the substrate dependent selectivity enables this system to better identify and remove the target contaminants at a trace level in the complicated coexisting matrices undoubtedly improving the efficiency of energy and resource use ii the pms activation based on surface complexes species will not lead to the formation of halogenated by products thereby decreasing the potential toxicity for real application iii the surface complexes significantly decompose only in the presence of electron rich pollutants electron donor which can maximize the utilization efficiency of pms 9 zr iv oh hso 5 zr iv ooso 3 h 2 o 10 zr iv ooso 3 a h 2 o zr iv oh so 4 2 oa h 4 conclusions in this work we reveal that azro2 can activate pms forming a highly reactive zr iv pms complex for selective degradation of organic compounds the zr iv pms oxidizes selected molecules mainly via the oxygen atom transfer pathway and is little affected by the background constituents in wastewater the moderate redox capacity of the surface complex results in extremely high utilization efficiency of pms and specific selectivity to electron rich organics the reactivity of zro2 is governed by the surface hydroxyl groups which serve as the sites to interact with the negatively charged pms anions unlike conventional transition metals based catalysts fe cu co etc azro2 has the merits of redox inertness and chemical stability thus almost no leaching of metal ions was observed during the reaction this system serves as a more precise platform for surface complexes dominated systems and provides a novel reaction scheme to address the micropollutants in wastewater treatment the findings also cast doubts on the argument of earlier studies that oxygen atom transfer pathway is related to high valent metal species overall this work sheds light on the designing and application of redox inert metals as catalysts for fenton like oxidation processes in which metals do not experience a rate limiting redox cycle further efforts should be dedicated to determining whether such a unique catalytical property is also possessed

15279,application of heterogeneous advanced oxidation processes aops for wastewater treatment suffers from the low oxidant utilization efficiency slow catalytic cycling and severe matrix interference herein we report that amorphous zirconium dioxide azro2 a redox inert metal oxide can efficiently activate peroxymonosulfate pms to degrade organic micropollutants under very low oxidant doses and complex coexisting matrices distinct from conventional aops where radicals are formed the surface zr iv pms complex was identified as the principal reactive species and primarily conducted oxygen atom transfer route with selected molecules quantitative structure activity relationship analysis indicated that the formation of zr iv pms complex was governed by the density of the surface hydroxyl groups the strong interaction between the zr atom and pms caused the deviation of the negative charge from zr iv metal sites to the oxidant as a result the o o bond of the adsorbed pms was prolonged and its oxidation potential elevated which enabled it to directly react with contaminants this study indicates the potential of azro2 as a novel and eco friendly catalyst that activates pms to selectively tackle organic contaminants and sheds light on the designing of fenton like catalysts using redox inert metals graphical abstract image graphical abstract a novel redox inert metal oxide amorphous zirconium dioxide azro2 is surprisingly capable of highly efficient decontamination through peroxymonosulfate pms activation the activity of azro2 in cbz degradation is 5 1 to 72 0 times higher than the conventional transition metal oxides the surface zr iv pms complex was identified as the principal reactive species and primarily conducted oxygen atom transfer route with selected

oxidation processes aops which rely on the generation of extremely reactive and thus highly unstable radical species e g so4 oh etc from certain redox active chemicals e g h2o2 pms have become state of the art water treatment technologies for the elimination of organic micropollutants hodges et al 2018 li et al 2020 zhang et al 2022 various strategies such as energy input e g heat uv wen et al 2022 carbon based materials duan et al 2014 transition metals chen et al 2022 yang et al 2019 etc can be used to activate the oxidants to generate these reactive radical species among these approaches transition metals with variable valent states and unoccupied 3d orbitals such as fe co mn cu etc are generally regarded as the most effective activators guo et al 2021 ren et al 2020b xu et al 2021 transient metals can promote the decomposition of oxidants to radicals through the mn m n 1 redox cycling during which the reduction of m n 1 to mn is usually the rate limiting step guo et al 2022 hodges et al 2006 song et al 2022 meanwhile the reduction of high valent metal species comes with the cost of oxidants decomposition without generating highly reactive radicals eqs 1 and 2 thus lowering the utilization efficiency of oxidants lyu et al 2018 mi et al 2022 therefore an economical and high efficient metal catalyst that does not depend on its redox cycling is highly desired 1 m

unique merits of low toxicity easy synthesis strong stability and excellent biocompatibility chen et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 applications of zro2 in wastewater treatment have been reported for example zro2 especially amorphous zro2 can act as the absorbent to remove anions in water such as fluoride pan et al 2013 arsenate moraga et al 2019 and phosphate su et al 2013 because they can strongly complex to the zr sites note that in heterogeneous fenton like oxidation processes the first step is usually the complexation between the transient metals and the oxidant anions e g hso5 s2o8 2 ho2 hu et al 2017 li et al 2021 nevertheless owing to the redox inert nature of zro2 little attention has been paid to its potential catalytic activity in fenton like reaction processes so far the application of zro2 in aops is limited to its role of an inert carrier of catalysts yin et al 2021 recent studies indicated that zro2 could activate h2o2 to generate radicals for example ziolek et al reported that d0 transition metal oxides e g zro2 ta2o5 nb2o5 with acidic base surface functional groups could induce the decomposition of h2o2 to generate radicals ziolek et al 2015 unlike conventional fenton like processes no interfacial electron transfer occurred in this process sobańska et al 2017 further found that amorphous zro2 azro2 showed peroxidase like activity at ph iep eq 3 it could decompose h2o2 to form oh and o2 at ph iep however it showed catalase like eq 4 activity that decomposed h2o2 to o2 in the proposed mechanism the electrons were only transferred from the h2o2 in the bulk solution to the adsorbed ho2 during this process the azro2 served as an ionic sponge where the charged o2 and o2 2 species and protons could be stabilized and accumulated on the surface our recent study has also demonstrated that the abundant hydroxyl groups on the surface of azro2 could induce the intermolecular electron transfer thereby promoting the production of ho2 o2 yin et al 2021 such a pathway does not involve the redox reaction of the zr metals which is distinct from conventional fenton like processes and would greatly increase the utilization efficiency of oxidants however these studies are still in their infancy and only few studies on glycerol oxidation have been reported sobańska et al 2017 it is still unclear whether it can be used to degrade organic contaminants in wastewater the key reactive species and the intrinsic mechanisms also remain ambiguous which deserves further investigations 3 ho 2 ads h 2 o 2 aq o h aq o 2 ads h 2 o 4 h 2 o 2 aq 1 2

azro2 activated pms complex zr iv pms rather than free radicals was identified as the principal reactive species in the azro2 pms system dft computation was employed to rationalize the mechanisms of

computational details are described in text s6 supporting information 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of amorphous and crystalline zro2 fig 1 a shows the xrd patterns of azro2 and czro2 the azro2 shows no obvious peaks and pattern suggesting an amorphous structure the czro2 exhibits a mixed crystal character consisting of monoclinic phase jcpds 37 1484 and tetragonal phase jcpds 50 1089 the hrtem and saed images are consistent with the xrd data fig 1e g no lattice fringe and crystalline signal can be observed in the azro2 sample while distinct 110 011 fringes corresponding to monoclinic and tetragonal phases as well as some bright dots are evident in the czro2 sample the sem images fig s2 reveal a fluffy appearance for both azro2 and czro2 the tem images fig 1d f show that the amorphous structure of azro2 became ordered after calcination the average size of the czro2 powder is 24 79 nm determined by the size distribution histogram fig 1h the stem element mapping fig 1i indicates the uniform distribution of zr and o in the azro2 particles ft ir and xps analysis revealed the functionalities on the surface of azro2 and czro2 in the ft ir spectrum of azro2 fig 1b the adsorption peak at 1348 cm 1 can be assigned to the deformation vibration of zr oh zhang et al 2019 the peaks at 3351 and 1633 cm 1 can be ascribed to the hydroxyl stretching and bending vibrations of the water molecules adsorbed on the surface su et al 2013 the intensities of these peaks were dramatically lower for the czro2 sample indicating the surface of czro2 was less hydroxylated the o 1s spectra in xps analysis point to a similar conclusion fig 1c table s3 the amount of surface anchored hydroxyl groups 531 6 ev was up to 56 0 for azro2 but the value for czro2 was only 20 7 the position of zr 3d5 2 peak of azro2 182 28 ev shifted toward lower binding energy by 0 26 ev compared with czro2 fig s3 which could be associated with the coordination defects and oxygen vacancies of amorphous metal oxides shan et al 2020 tga analysis again suggested that azro2 had a large amount of adsorbed water and terminal hydroxyl groups on the surface fig s4 moreover the specific surface areas ssa of azro2 fig s5 was calculated to be 954 53 m2 g 1 more than 18 times greater than that of czro2 52 99 m2 g 1 3 2 catalytic activities of azro2 and czro2 the catalytic activities of azro2 and czro2 were evaluated by the degradation of cbz figs 2 a and s6 show that neither of them could serve as the catalyst of pds and h2o2 cbz was degraded by less than 3 in the pds and h2o2 systems regardless of the presence or absence of zro2 in contrast 39 4 and 93 8 of cbz were degraded in the czro2 pms and azro2 pms systems in 15 min and the pseudo first order rate constants k obs were determined to be 0 0303 and 0 2011 min 1 respectively fig s7 an examination of the residual oxidants fig s8 served as an additional evidence of the higher catalytic activity of azro2 only 35 4 of pms in solution was decomposed in the czro2 pms system but it was completely decayed in the azro2 pms system the activity of azro2 in terms of catalyzing pms to degrade cbz was compared with several commercial metal oxides including fe2o3 co3o4 mn3o4 fe3o4 and cuo under the same reaction conditions catalyst 0 5 g l pms 0 1 mm ph 3 0 the sources and properties of these metal oxide are listed in table s4 it can be clearly seen in fig 2b that the azro2 has significantly higher activity than the other metal oxides with the k obs value 5 1 to 72 0 times higher fig s9 the activity of azro2 was also compared with those of the heterogeneous catalysts reported in literature recently here a reactivity index k value defined by normalizing the apparent reaction rate constant by the pms dose was used for comparison table s5 in details qian et al 2021 as displayed in fig 2c the azro2 pms system has a k value of 2 011 min 1 mm 1 2 3 to 86 7 times higher than the reported catalysts figs s10 and s11a show the degradation of cbz at varying pms azro2 and initial ph levels a positive relationship can be found between the rate of cbz degradation and the azro2 dose fig s10e the influence of pms on the degradation is more complicated the k obs showed a volcano like shape with the change of the pms dose fig s10f increasing ph suppressed the degradation of cbz fig s11a possibly due to the reduced electrostatic interaction between the catalyst and the negatively charged pms hso5 pk a 9 4 or neutral cbz molecules pk a 13 9 huang and zhang 2019 the details are discussed in text s7 azro2 remained rather stable with the leaching of zr4 less than 70 μg l 1 at ph 2 5 7 0 fig s11b thus avoiding the secondary pollution for real water bodies besides fig s11c demonstrates that dissolved zr4 at such a level had negligible contribution to the degradation of cbz the degradation of cbz in the azro2 pms system was not or little affected by the water matrices including organic matter fig s12a b various inorganic anions cl so4 2 no3 and cations na k ca2 mg2 fig 2d h2po4 was found to suppress the reaction significantly and the underlying mechanism will be discussed later in this article the performance of the azro2 pms was also tested in real water and wastewater matrices results show that over 80 of cbz was removed in 30 min fig 2e with nearly 40 toc removal in 90 min fig s12c except ba nb and atz the other selected compounds containing the electron donating groups such as och3 oh and ch3 xie et al 2022 zong et al 2021 were significantly degraded in the azro2 pms system with the abatement ratios ranging from 71 4 to 100 fig 2d the reason for the unsatisfied removal of ba nb and atz could be the existence of electron withdrawn groups in their molecular structures including no2 cooh and other groups xie et al 2022 zong et al 2021 the high selectivity of the azro2 pms system towards electron rich contaminants implies that it may not work through a free radical oxidation mechanism 3 3 identification of reactive oxygen species usually oh and so4 are the reactive species in activated pms systems hodges et al 2018 huang et al 2022 jia et al 2021 however cbz degradation in the azro2 pms system was unlikely due to these radical species fig 3 a b show that the presence of methanol meoh or tert butanol t buoh at 10 mm showed a marginal effect on cbz degradation further increasing the quenching agent concentrations to 100 mm scavenger pms molar ratio 1000 1 only slightly suppressed cbz degradation k obs from 0 20 to 0 17 min 1 no singles corresponding to hba and bq which could be generated from the oxidation of ba and hba by radicals could be detected during the oxidation process fig 3c d dong et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 in addition no signals of these radicals were detected in epr analysis fig 3e the contribution of o2 to cbz degradation was also ruled out adding the quenching agents of o2 i e chloroform chcl3 1 0 mm and benzoquinone p bq 1 0 mm showed no adverse affect on cbz degradation figs 3b and s13a also not only was there no specific signal at 532 nm for the reaction of nbt with o2 fig s14 but the dmpo o2 peak was not monitored fig 3e moreover 1o2 has been demonstrated ineffective in degrading cbz with a second order reaction rate constant less than 106 m 1 s 1 li et al 2018 considering the first order rate constant for 1o2 reacting with h2o is 2 5 105 s 1 the contribution of 1o2 if formed would be minor text s8 further epr analysis solvent d2o exchange experiment and photoexcited rose bengal rb system clearly strengthened the above conclusions figs s15 s17 text s9 for details in metal activated pms oxidation system the initiation step is generally the formation of an immediate metal peroxide complex m ooso3 hu et al 2017 li et al 2021 in this system the o o bond of zr iv ooso3 complex if formed did not undergo further cleavage to give rise to reactive oxygen species ross thus we hypothesize that the reactive zr iv pms complex per se reacted with cbz fig s18a shows that mixing pms and azro2 in advance remarkably accelerated the removal of cbz because pre mixing allowed the formation and accumulation of the reactive zr iv pms complex in the solution the longer the premixing time was the more significant of the acceleration was formation of zr iv pms complex also explains the degradation of cbz even after free pms was depleted in the solution as illustrated in fig s18b the pms concentration rapidly declined to under detection limit after 5 min but the removal of cbz did not cease the presence of cbz also significantly accelerated the decomposition of pms in solution fig s18c which was also in well accordance with the characteristics of a reactive complex dominated system duan et al 2018 ren et al 2020a in fact the zr iv pms complex is relatively stable and can be separated from the solution fig s19a shows that the total pms concentration reduced from 1 0 mm to 0 86 mm after mixing with 1 0 g l azro2 for 5 min however only 0 66 mm pms was measured in the bulk solution it implies that the rest 0 20 mm pms was complexed to the surface of azro2 then the azro2 in the solution was reclaimed by filtration the pms concentration associated with the filtered azro2 was determined to be 0 16 mm data not shown reasonably matching the loss of pms in the solution more importantly the reclaimed azro2 alone was capable to degrade cbz as shown in fig 4 a the cbz 42 3 μm was abated by approximate 20 after mixing with the reclaimed azro2 for 15 min in contrast the removal was 1 3 by equal quantity of azro2 without pms pre treatment fig s19b by adding potassium iodide ki as a pms quencher which greatly interrupted pollutant degradation the cbz oxidation by the surface bound pms complex was further confirmed fig s20 si et al 2022 electrochemical tests revealed more insights into the interactions between azro2 pms and cbz the i t test using azro2 coated fto glass electrode showed negligible current output upon cbz addition fig s21a indicating no reaction occurred between cbz and the azro2 however the addition of pms generated a current surge fig s21b and injecting cbz afterwards resulted in another current surge fig s21b interestingly the dosage of cbz could lead to the elevation of current density on the filtered azro2 coated electrode fig s21c these observations collectively indicates that reactions occurred between azro2 and pms probably forming a zr iv pms complex which could degrade cbz ren et al 2020a the lsv curves corroborate the above speculation the current slightly increased in the presence of pms and then greatly increased after further introduction of cbz fig s21d 3 4 characterized the zr iv pms complex atr ftir and confocal raman spectrum were employed to characterize the interfacial interactions between pms and azro2 as shown in fig 4b the azro2 sample in water exhibited a broad peak at 3096 cm 1 which can be attributed to the o h stretching of the surface hydroxyl groups υ oh zhang et al 2013 in general the broad peak of oh stretching arises from intramolecular hydrogen bonds if it becomes narrow it suggests less hydrogen bonds either because of less adjacent oh groups or the negative charge center shifts toward the opposite direction of the h atom after the addition of pms this peak narrowed and redshifted by 178 cm 1 in the azro2 pms system indicating the decrease in electron cloud intensity of surface oh groups resulted from the interaction between azro2 and pms mi et al 2022 it can be rationalized by the increase of electron withdrawing capacity of the bonded zr possibly arising from the partial charge deviation from metal sites to pms zhang et al 2013 accordingly the appearance of the characteristic s o stretching vibration of hso5 at 1240 cm 1 in the azro2 pms system and its red shift 8 cm 1 compared to that of pms alone again served as the evidence of the strong binding between h o o so3 and azro2 thus the atr ftir results demonstrated the replacement of surface oh by hso5 to bond with the metal sites the complexation between azro2 and pms is an inner sphere coordination because changing the ionic strengths of the reaction solution from 10 to 100 mm showed negligible effect on cbz degradation fig s22 zhang et al 2013 zhao et al 2022 in situ confocal raman spectrum further corroborated the strong interfacial interaction between pms and azro2 and the details were shown in fig s23 high resolution xps spectrum of the azro2 before and after mixing with pms was shown in fig s24 the appearance of the s 2p signal indicates the adsorption of s containing species on the surface fig s24a this peak can be deconvoluted to two subpeaks corresponding to so4 2 169 0 ev and hso5 170 1 ev fig s24b moreover the o1s peak denoting the portion of the adsorbed oxygen 531 6 ev increased from 56 0 to 70 7 after mixing with pms and slightly decreased to 67 0 after the reaction with cbz fig s24c the overall increase in adsorbed oxygen might be attributed to the adsorption of hso5 and so4 2 on the azro2 meanwhile the binding energy of the zr3d5 2 increased 0 38 ev after the addition of pms fig s24d indicating a decreased electron cloud density on the zr atoms likely because of the replacement of electron rich surface hydroxyl groups anchored on the zr atoms by hso5 h2po4 has been demonstrated to show a high affinity toward zr metals by forming a strong zr o p coordination bond qiu et al 2020 it can compete with pms for the surface binding sites on the azro2 thereby preventing the formation of zr iv pms complex ft ir analysis revealed fig s25a a characteristic peak at 1014 cm 1 belonging to h2po4 in the azro2 pms h2po4 system xia et al 2012 whereas the peaks attributed to pms disappeared furthermore the broad peak centered at 3419 cm 1 shrank dramatically in the presence of h2po4 demonstrating the replacement of surface hydroxyl groups by h2po4 zhang et al 2008 zhang et al 2013 in the presence of 1 0 mm h2po4 the decomposition efficiency of cbz and pms markedly decreased by 29 3 and 17 8 respectively further increasing h2po4 concentration to 5 0 mm almost completely inhibited the degradation of cbz and moreover the abatement of pms also greatly reduced fig s25b c this serves additional evidence that the zr iv pms complex played a central role in the degradation of cbz 3 5 factors governing the reaction rate to identify the key factors governing the formation of the zr iv pms complex a series of azro2 x with similar amorphous phase fig s26 but varying ssa pore volumes and hydroxyl contents figs 4c and s27 were synthesized and their catalytic activities were evaluated figs 4d and s28 the results in fig 4e show a positive linear relationship between the hydroxyl group contents on the azro2 x θ calculated as azr oh ao 100 eq 5 and the apparent degradation rate constants k obs of cbz in the azro2 x pms systems in contrast the correlation between the pore volume of the azro2 x and k obs was weak r 2 0 366 fig s29 ssa also appeared to be unessential to the catalytic activity r 2 0 679 fig s30 based on the above data the density of the surface hydroxyl groups is the key factor determining the catalytic activity of azro2 the czro2 possessed a lower surface hydroxyl group density 20 7 fig 4c than the azro2 x which explains its lower catalytic activity k obs 0 0308 min 1 fig 4d it is worth noting that the amount of pms adsorbed q was also linearly related to the quantity of the hydroxyl groups on the azro2 x fig s31a c eq 6 thus the degradation of cbz was governed by the quantity of pms complexed on the azro2 particles fig s31d eq 7 in other words the zr iv pms complex played a critical role in cbz degradation the isoelectric point of the azro2 is 5 45 fig s32 at ph 5 45 the hydroxyl groups oh are protonated and positively charged thereby facilitating the adsorption of the hso5 anion and the formation of the zr iv pms complex 5 k obs 0 0062 0 0012 θ 0 0586 0 0431 r 2 0 879 6 q 2 5427 0 7130 θ 48 6839 23 5855 r 2 0 802 7 k obs 0 0025 0 0002 q 0 1878 0 0291 r 2 0 974 3 6 other properties of the reactive complex distinct from free radical oxidation the zr iv pms is highly selective and reacts with organic compounds through oxygen atom transfer pathway as a result the utilization efficiency of pms is significantly higher and the degradation products are different from the radical oxidation systems the pms utilization efficiency defined as the amount of cbz oxidized by each μmol of pms eq 8 of the azro2 pms system was 0 397 μmol one order of magnitude higher than those in the activated pms oxidation systems where free radical oxidation is dominant for instance the values in the pms oxidation systems catalyzed by lacoo3 guo et al 2020 fe3o4 deng et al 2017 and mos2 zhou et al 2020 are 0 0568 0 0466 and 0 035 μmol respectively for cbz degradation the high pms utilization efficiency is not only because of the selectivity of the zr iv pms but due to the avoidance of pms consumption during the reduction of m n 1 to mn that occurred in the radicals dominated systems eq 2 8 pms utilization efficiency the amount of oxidized cbz pms consumption the azro2 pms system exhibits high selectivity and reacts with organics through an oxygen atom transfer pathway for example atz that can be decomposed rapidly in uv pms system a well accepted radicals based system k so4 atz k oh atz 3 0 109 m 1 s 1 appeared highly persistent in the azro2 pms system fig s17 shao et al 2018 pmso was effectively removed in both azro2 pms and uv pms systems fig s17 no pmso2 production was observed in pms alone system fig 5 a however 89 2 of the removed pmso was transformed to methyl phenyl sulfone pmso2 in the azro2 pms system fig 5b d while hydroxylated products m z 157 03021 m h were formed in the uv pms system fig 5d formation of pmso2 is indicative of an oxygen atom transfer pathway li et al 2021 because pmso2 could not be degraded by azro2 pms fig 5e other pathways if existed only had a contribution less than 10 8 li et al 2022 2021 notably due to the inherent molecular orbital properties of zirconium metal this oxygen atom transfer pathway can not originate from the existence of high valent zirconium which has not been reported so far in any fields it was well known that the high valent metal species could undergo the oxygen atom exchange oae reaction with h2 18o zong et al 2021 here the 18o labeled pms16o18o product m z 159 0360 m h retention time 9 45 min was produced from the reaction of pms16o and fe iv o fe ii hclo process in h2 18o matrix fig s33a whereas no pms16o18o signal was detected in the azro2 pms system fig s33b further excluding the contribution of high valent metal species the difference in the degradation mechanisms between azro2 pms and uv pms systems was also evidenced by a comparism of degradation products of cbz as shown in fig s34 and table s6 the azro2 pms system led to the formation of 2 hydroxyacridine 9 carbaldehyde p10 1 1 bis 2 formylphenyl urea p11 and 9 hydroxyacridine 10 9h carboxamide p12 and some unidentified intermediates that were not observed in the uv pms system in contrast acridine 9 carbaldehyde p8 was generated in the uv pms system but was not found in the azro2 pms system the results suggest the different pathways of cbz degradation in the two systems further studies are need to assess the toxicities of the products in the different systems 3 7 validating the mechanism by dft computation the formation of the zr iv pms complex and its role in cbz degradation are further rationalized by molecular simulation based on density functional theory dft the corresponding adsorption energies e ads and average o o bond lengths l o o of pms molecules before and after adsorption are displayed in table s7 one can see that azro2 has a higher adsorption energy toward pms molecule 1 056 ev fig 6 b than czro2 0 749 ev fig 6a the higher affinity is ascribed to the deficient coordination numbers of zr 6 at the adsorption sites of the amorphous zro2 compared with the normal coordination numbers in crystals 7 shan et al 2020 in fact the defective coordination behavior has been widely recognized in amorphous oxides mavracic et al 2018 after surface hydroxylation the formation of intermolecular hydrogen bonds further increases the adsorption energy to 1 745 ev fig 6c which not only favors the zr iv pms formation but induces a negative charge deviation from zr metal sites to pms fig 6d f thereby boosting the oxidation potential of the zr iv pms complex based on the above data and interpretations the reaction mechanism can be proposed for the degradation of cbz in the azro2 pms system fig 6g first the zr iv pms complex was formed via the substitution of surface hydroxyl groups by pms anions eq 9 the strong binding but moderate electron transfer between azro2 and pms prevented the complexes from heterolytic cleavage to form ross instead the zr iv pms complex attacked selected molecules through an oxygen atom transfer pathway eq 10 the high oxidizing potential of zr iv pms was due to the prolonged peroxide o o bond fig 6a c table s7 caused by the attraction of electron cloud from pms to the zr atoms such an azro2 induced non radical pathway endows the system a competitive advantage over the radical triggered pathway with respect to the following aspects i the substrate dependent selectivity enables this system to better identify and remove the target contaminants at a trace level in the complicated coexisting matrices undoubtedly improving the efficiency of energy and resource use ii the pms activation based on surface complexes species will not lead to the formation of halogenated by products thereby decreasing the potential toxicity for real application iii the surface complexes significantly decompose only in the presence of electron rich pollutants electron donor which can maximize the utilization efficiency of pms 9 zr iv oh hso 5 zr iv ooso 3 h 2 o 10 zr iv ooso 3 a h 2 o zr iv oh so 4 2 oa h 4 conclusions in this work we reveal that azro2 can activate pms forming a highly reactive zr iv pms complex for selective degradation of organic compounds the zr iv pms oxidizes selected molecules mainly via the oxygen atom transfer pathway and is little affected by the background constituents in wastewater the moderate redox capacity of the surface complex results in extremely high utilization efficiency of pms and specific selectivity to electron rich organics the reactivity of zro2 is governed by the surface hydroxyl groups which serve as the sites to interact with the negatively charged pms anions unlike conventional transition metals based catalysts fe cu co etc azro2 has the merits of redox inertness and chemical stability thus almost no leaching of metal ions was observed during the reaction this system serves as a more precise platform for surface complexes dominated systems and provides a novel reaction scheme to address the micropollutants in wastewater treatment the findings also cast doubts on the argument of earlier studies that oxygen atom transfer pathway is related to high valent metal species overall this work sheds light on the designing and application of redox inert metals as catalysts for fenton like oxidation processes in which metals do not experience a rate limiting redox cycle further efforts should be dedicated to determining whether such a unique catalytical property is also possessed
