synthetic solutions and the linear driving force model was fitted to the breakthrough curves the equilibrium relations in continuous system was well adjusted by the langmuir model in which the maximum biosorption capacity was 1 404 mmol l 1 for ni2 ions and 1 656 mmol l 1 for cu2 ions in addition biosorption desorption cycles were performed using acidified calcium chloride solution as eluent after the first cycle the biosorption were on average 75 of the initial uptake capacities of ni2 and cu2 ions posteriorly the biosorbent was evaluated for the removal of metal ions from pre treated electroplating effluent by chemical precipitation and cyanide oxidation due to the high concentrations of light metals na k ca mg in the effluent the biosorption capacities were reduced by an average of 28 and the shape of the breakthrough curves were strongly affected these behaviors were attributed to the simultaneous removal of metal ions and the multicomponent biosorption equilibrium keywords biosorption metal ions continuous system immobilization desorption electroplating effluent 1 introduction environmental pollution by heavy metal has been a significant concern in many countries due to the amount of untreated wastewater being discharged into the environmental many studies have reported the presence of toxic metals in water sediments soil atmosphere and in the biota of contaminated areas 1 3 among the metals nickel and copper are important elements for global development and widely used in many industrial activities including electroplating that generates a large volume of effluent with high concentrations of metal ions in addition these metals can also be found in landfill leachate and sewage sludge 4 although many metals are considered micronutrients for living organisms certain metal species and continuous exposure to them can be highly toxic 5 6 copper is an essential trace metal that is required for the catalysis of several important cellular enzymes however the exposure to high doses of copper can also harm cells due to its potential to catalyze the generation of toxic reactive oxygen species transport of copper and the cellular copper content are tightly regulated 7 nickel is an essential micronutrient for the growth and development of plants as part of several biological functions however the exposure to nickel contaminated environments has the potential to produce a variety of pathological effects in humans including contact dermatitis cardiovascular and kidney diseases and even cancer 5 a wide range of separation processes have been employed for removal of heavy metals from aqueous solution including chemical precipitation electrochemical processes adsorption ion exchange nanofiltration and reverse osmosis membranes however the most of these techniques could be not effective enough for very diluted solutions require high costs of investment and or operating high reagent consumption and generate hazardous sludge 8 9 as an alternative method the biosorption metal ions from aqueous solution has demonstrated a high uptake capacity efficiency for diluted solutions high selectivity and low cost biosorption can be considered as a subcategory of adsorption however the bio prefix denotes the involvement of a biological entity i e living organism component or derived product from a living organism 10 the mechanisms that can be present in biosorption processes including physical adsorption ion exchange chemisorption including complexation chelation and microprecipitation 11 many types of biomass have been investigated for metal biosorption however an ideal biosorbent besides having a high biosorption capacity should be naturally abundant readily available and cost effective 10 12 brown algae e g sargassum sp have been reported as very effective biosorbents for removal of metal ions since they are widely available have high uptake capacity and can be regenerated in addition large amounts of brown algae can be found on the beaches promoting unpleasant environments for tourists 9 the biosorption abilities of the brown algae are often attributed to the presence of several functional groups on the cell walls surface such as carboxylic acid sulfonic acid and amide groups which can act as ligands for metal ions 13 14 the most researches on metal biosorption has been carried out using synthetic solution under laboratory conditions however for the biosorption becomes a competitive technology for removal of metal ions studies should be developed in order to treat large volumes of effluent in continuous systems such as fixed bed column 15 16 fixed bed column is a design for continuous systems that allows the treatment of large volumes of effluents attains a high yield high concentration gradient is easy to operate and it can be easily scaled up from a laboratory scale 17 on the other hand the bed packing with microorganisms or particulate biomass can be not practical because of small particle size poor mechanical strength little rigidity and swelling of biomass during sorption process decreasing the efficiency of the biosorption process 18 thus the immobilization in polymer matrices e g calcium alginate has been widely used to facilitate bed packing and to improve the distribution of the biosorbent in the column 17 19 brown algae have in its cell wall alginate which can be easily solubilized in water and it has often been used as an immobilization matrix for many kind of biomass thus the extracted alginate could be used to immobilize the extraction residue itself which has presented remaining biosorption capacity 20 22 unlike synthetic solutions the real effluents have a very complex composition including high concentrations of light metals e g na k ca mg and other substances consequently the metal biosorption from real effluents becomes highly competitive and strongly dependent on the selectivity of the biosorbent 23 24 pozdniakova et al 25 obtained that the biosorption capacity of zinc ions was highly affected by the composition from electroplating effluent in addition to regenerate the biosorbent and provide safe post treatment of metal loaded biosorbent it is necessary to remove and recover metal ions from the biosorbent that has been used in the biosorption process 4 the biosorbent regeneration and metal recovery could make feasible the application of the biosorption technique under real conditions in this paper the immobilized biosorbent produced from sargassum sp was initially evaluated for removal of ni2 and cu2 from synthetic solution in cycles of biosorption and desorption posteriorly the biosorbent was used for biosorption of ni2 and cu2 ions from electroplating effluent the linear driving force ldf mathematical model was used to simulate the breakthrough curves from synthetic solutions 2 materials and methods 2 1 biomass and biosorbent production brown algae sargassum sp were purchased from the association of algae producers of ceará state brazil the algae were washed with tap water and rinsed with distilled water dried at 60 c ground into particles with an average diameter of 2 mm and stored in closed recipients as described by barquilha et al 20 the alginate was extracted using sodium carbonate solution 2 w v na2co3 anidrol after pretreatment with formaldehyde 0 40 v v and hydrochloric acid 0 10 m solutions according to the method proposed by mchugh 26 with some modifications after the immobilized biosorbent was produced by the drip method of a solution containing the sodium alginate and the extraction residue into calcium chloride solution 4 w v described by barquilha et al 27 the characterizations of the biosorbent before and after metal biosorption were carried out and previously published including scanning electron microscopy sem energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir thermodynamic analysis ph effect among other batch experiments 20 27 2 2 biosorption of ni2 and cu2 ions from synthetic solutions experiments in fixed bed columns were performed using a jacketed column of stainless steel with a length of 50 cm and an internal diameter of 2 80 cm the bed length was fixed at 30 6 cm and the synthetic solutions containing ni2 niso4 6h2o synth and cu2 cuso4 5h2o synth ions were fed into the column bottom using a peristaltic bomb with a flow rate of 4 ml min 1 and metal concentrations of 0 5 1 2 and 3 mmol l 1 the solution ph was adjusted at 4 5 with a sulfuric acid solution and the temperature of the column was controlled at 30 c using an ultra thermostatic bath samples were collected at top of the column until the bed saturation and they were analyzed by atomic absorption spectroscopy aas the breakthrough curves were obtained by plotting c o u t c f e e d versus t when the system reaches equilibrium c o u t c f e e d 1 the uptake capacity can be calculated by the breakthrough curve

cm 2 5 mathematical modeling of the breakthrough curves mathematical modeling has an important role in the scale up process from laboratory experiments to industrial scale suitable models can help to analyze the experimental data identify the mechanisms relevant to the biosorption process predict changes according to different operating conditions optimize the biosorption process 30 in this work to describe the biosorption process of ni2 and cu2 ions by the immobilized biosorbent in fixed bed column the model employed has the following assumptions i axial and radial dispersions are negligible in the fixed bed column ii physical properties of the biosorbent and of the fluid phases are constant iii column void fraction is constant iv process conditions are isothermal and isobaric v the resistance to mass transfer in the outer film is negligible vi a linear driving force ldf is used to describe the concentration profile inside the biosorbent vii the biosorption equilibrium is described by the langmuir isotherm based on the above assumptions the mathematical model was obtained through the mass balance equation for the liquid and solid phases in the fixed bed column the mass balance of the concentration of ni2 and cu2 ions in the fluid phase can be described by eq 4 4 c t u ε c t z z ρ b ε q t z t 0 where c concentration of metal ions mmol l 1 u ε interstitial velocity of the solution cm min 1 z axial coordinate in the bed cm ρ b bed density g l 1 for the resolution of the mass balance equation in the fluid phase the following initial and boundary conditions were used 5 c 0 z 0 6 c t 0 0 t 0 c f e e d t 0 i n z 0 assuming that the immobilized biosorbent prepared from brown algae sargassum sp has negligible pore volume and the mechanisms of biosorption in the fixed bed column involve mass transfer of metal ions in solution around the biosorbent ion exchange and complexation the diffusion rate inside the pores described by fick s law was replaced by a simplified expression eq 7 in order to facilitate the resolution of the differential equations system this model known as linear driving force ldf assumes that driving force of mass transfer for the solid phase

resolution of the ldf model the following initial condition was used 8 q z 0 0 to solve this system of partial differential equations composed of eqs 4 and 7 together with the initial and boundary conditions described by eqs 5 6 and 8 and the equilibrium relation through the langmuir isotherm eq 9 the method of lines was used 31 this method transforms the system of partial differential equations into an ordinary differential equations ode system the subroutine dassl developed by petzold 32 coded in fortran was used to solve the ode system the mass transfer coefficient k s only

desorption cycles of ni2 and cu2 ions from synthetic solutions experiments on biosorbent regeneration were evaluated over three cycles of biosorption and desorption in fixed bed column the biosorption of ni2 and cu2 ions were performed for the concentration of 1 mmol l 1 solution ph at 4 5 flow rate of 4 ml min 1 and bed height of 30 6 cm a solution of calcium chloride 0 5 m acidified at ph 3 0 with hydrochloric acid was used as eluent in the desorption cycles in order to use a small volume of eluent solution 500 ml the desorption was separated in two steps with a flow rate of 4 ml min 1 the first step was performed in continuous flow due to the large amount of ni2 and cu2 ions desorbed in the initial minutes whereas the second step was performed in recirculated flow to exhaust the desorption capacity of the final eluent volume 140 ml the amount of desorbed metal ions m d can be calculated by the sum the two steps according to the eq 11 11 m d q 1000 0 t c o u t d t c v e where v e is the volume of eluent recirculated ml desorption efficiency e d was calculated by eq 11 12 e d m d m b i o 100 where m b i o is the amount of biosorbed metal ions on biosorbent mmol 2 7 biosorption of ni2 and cu2 ions from electroplating effluent electroplating effluent was collected from an industry in the northwest of parana brazil effluents discharges containing nickel and copper come from the rinse baths after the electrochemical processes in this industry effluent containing nickel or copper was collected separately for each disposal due to the high metal concentration 1500 mg l 1 and the presence of cyanide from the alkaline copper baths the effluents were initially treated by chemical precipitation and cyanide oxidation these treatments were performed with commercial reagents such as hydrated lime type ch1 and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 200 vol to obtain effluents with characteristics similar to the existing treatment conditions in the industry these experiments were carried out in fixed bed columns with constant flow rate of 4 ml min 1 and temperature of 30 c in addition the electroplating effluents were collected in three ways i from nickel disposal only ii from copper disposal only and iii from nickel and copper mixed disposal since real effluents have a complex composition the solutions before and after biosorption were characterized by several parameters and metal species including ph cod sulfate chloride cyanide sodium potassium calcium magnesium nickel copper zinc lead aluminum iron and chromium 3 results and discussions 3 1 biosorption of ni2 and cu2 ions from synthetic solutions the experiments in fixed bed column for the feed concentration of 0 5 3 0 mmol l 1 were performed using similar operating conditions of the bed between the experiments such conditions including dry weight of the biosorbent w d bed porosity ε l and bed density ρ l are given in tables 1 and 2 the mathematical model linear driving force ldf uses the equilibrium relation to determine the biosorption capacity and to simulate the breakthrough curves the equilibrium relations were initially obtained in a batch system and they were well adjusted by the langmuir model as presented by barquilha et al 27 in which the maximum biosorption capacity and the langmuir constant were respectively 1 098 mmol g 1 and 1 100 l mmol 1 for ni2 ions and 1 597 mmol g 1 and 4 087 l mmol 1 for cu2 ions however these equilibrium relations for biosorption of ni2 and cu2 ions provided by the langmuir model in batch have large deviations from experimental results obtained in fixed bed column as shown in the tables 3 and 4 this behavior has been quite common in processes involving ion exchange mechanism according to da silva et al 28 the equilibrium condition in closed system batch is different of that obtained in a continuous system fixed bed column in batch the released ions by the biosorbent remain in the solution and compete with the target ions ni2 and cu2 on the other hand in continuous flow systems the released ions by the biosorbent are continually carried by the feed solution klamer and van krevelen 33 suggested that the equilibrium data for ion exchange processes are obtained in continuous system thus the experimental results in fixed bed column were used to fitted another langmuir isotherm as shown in fig 1 the parameters values obtained by the langmuir isotherm q m a x and b in closed and continuous systems were then compared while the maximum biosorption capacity increased 27 87 for ni2 ions and 3 69 for cu2 ions the constant b that is related metal biosorbent affinity increased 289 18 for ni2 ions and 89 19 for cu2 ions these values are in agreement with the deviations obtained that were higher for the more diluted solutions since for a concentration of target ions tending to infinity the concentration of released ions would become negligible thus the langmuir isotherm fitted to the experimental results in continuous system was used together with the ldf model to simulate the biosorption of ni2 and cu2 ions in fixed bed column as shown in the figs 2 and 3 the uptake capacities the mass transfer coefficients k s and the length of mass transfer zone mtz as well as the determination coefficients r 2 and objective functions f o b j values are given in tables 5 and 6 as shown in the figs 2 and 3 the feed concentration of metal ions has a significant effect on the breakthrough curves when the feed concentration increases both times of breakthrough and saturation decrease due to the higher biosorption rate of the metal ions thus the mtz is an important parameter to scale a fixed bed column in which the highest ratio between the biosorption capacities in the breakthrough point q t b and in the exhaustion point q t s a t corresponds the shortest mtz that is mtz is zero when q t b q t s a t according to mtz values especially for the biosorption of cu2 ions table 6 the increase in the feed concentration did not necessarily increase ztm this behavior was attributed to the increase in the concentration gradient between the biosorbent surface and the solution which improves the drive force for mass transfer and reduces the resistance to film diffusion however the residence time of the solution in the column may not be sufficient to achieve the complete uptake in short mtz at high metal concentration increasing progressively the increase in the feed concentration also results in an increase in the biosorption capacity at the exhaustion point this increase tends to be when the concentrations are high that is in the plateau region of the isotherm in addition the mtz values were lower for cu2 ions than ni2 ions that were attributed to greater affinity for cu2 ions kleinübing et al 34 obtained similar results of the mtz for biosorption of ni2 and cu2 ions on the brown algae sargassum filipendula since the ldf model considers that the driving force for mass transfer is linear with the metal concentration the estimated values of k s as a function of feed concentration of ni2 and cu2 ions can be described by eqs 12 and 13 respectively 12 k s n i 4 72 x 10 4 c n i 4 82 x 10 4 13 k s c u 3 69 x 10 4 c c u 5 07 x 10 4 according to breakthrough curves the ldf model was well adjusted to the experimental results however in the first moments the model predicts output concentrations close to zero for biosorption of cu2 ions that were not reached in the experimental results these behaviors significantly increased the f o b j values the mass transfer coefficient k s values were compared to obtained values in other studies kleinübing et al 35 obtained k s values for ni2 ions within the range of 3 87 10 3 to 9 00 10 3 min 1 while the k s values for cu2 ions were obtained within the range of 1 28 10 3 to 12 29 10 3 min 1 28 35 both biosorption studies were performed using the brown algae sargassum sp as biosorbent in fixed bed columns 3 2 biosorption desorption cycles of ni2 and cu2 ions from synthetic solutions biosorption and desorption cycles of ni2 and cu2 ions were shown in figs 4 and 5 respectively the biosorbent prepared from the brown algae sargassum sp was efficiently used over three cycles of biosorption however the biosorption capacity of ni2 and cu2 ions were slightly reduced the biosorption capacity of ni2 ions was reduced by 21 compared to the initial biosorption capacity it can be attributed to loss of biosorbent mass and changes on active sites as non reversible bonds with h and ca2 ions 25 36 on the other hand the biosorption capacity of cu2 ions was reduced by 28 and it was mainly attributed to the high amount of cu2 ions remaining on the adsorbent due to its great metal biosorbent affinity making desorption difficult e d 74 however although the biosorption capacity of cu2 ions have decreased the breakthrough curves maintained a similar operating time and was mainly affected in the exhaust stage fig 5a as mentioned before the desorption cycles were performed in two steps in order to use a small volume of eluent 500 ml according to figs 4 and 5 the larger amount of desorbed metal ions occurs in the initial minutes of the continuous step and then decreases significantly thus the last volume of eluent 140 ml was recirculated to ensure that its desorption capacity has been exhausted tables 7 and 8 show the mass balances of sorption desorption cycles of ni2 and cu2 ions respectively these results show that the total amount of cu2 ions experimental biosorption capacity q e plus the remaining amount q r on the biosorbent increased after the first biosorption cycle the q r values are the remaining amount of metal accumulated over the cycles this can be attributed to desorption of cu2 ions in the unanalyzed aqueous solution used to rinse the bed after desorption since the remaining amount of cu2 ions on the biosorbents was still high seolatto et al 37 obtained similar results using the brown algae sargassum sp in biosorption desorption cycles of ni2 ions the desorption efficiency using mgso4 h2so4 ph 3 0 as eluent was higher than 95 and the biosorption capacity decreased by 15 in the third biosorption cycle 3 3 biosorption of ni2 and cu2 ions in real effluent from electroplating industry experiments of biosorption of ni2 and cu2 ions in real effluent from electroplating industry were performed in fixed bed columns for operating conditions similar to that used with synthetic solutions in order to compare the obtained results figs 6 and 7 show the breakthrough curves of the biosorption of ni2 and cu2 ions respectively pretreated by chemical precipitation and cyanide oxidation in addition a comparison between the biosorption from real effluents and the synthetic solutions with the closest concentration were added to them tables 9 and 10 exhibit the physicochemical parameters and the detected metals to understand the competitiveness effect on active sites such results were given in units of milligram per liter which are more usual for real effluents the physicochemical parameters cod oil and grease cyanide chloride and sulfate did not present significant differences before and after biosorption and they may not be removed by the biosorbent on the other hand the analyzes of metal ions show that there is a simultaneous removal theses ions reducing the biosorption rate and capacity of ni2 and cu2 ions among the detected ions magnesium mg ions is the one that competes more with the target ions because its concentration decreases considerably at the beginning of the biosorption the concentration of calcium ca ions increased in the output solution because the ca ions are initially bound to the biosorbent and they act as ion exchangers however the amount of calcium ions released from the biosorbent in real effluent is probably less than in synthetic solution since its concentration in real effluent is high and an equilibrium must be established table 11 shows the biosorption capacities of ni2 and cu2 ions obtained from electroplating effluents and the biosorption capacities predicted by langmuir model for synthetic solutions the biosorption capacities from real effluents decreased by 29 69 for ni2 ions and 26 24 for cu2 ions in addition the presence of high concentrations of light metals na k ca and mg in the solution increased the mass transfer zone mtz values as shown in the tables 5 6 and 11 the increase in mtz can also be observed in the breakthrough curves figs 6 and 7b in which the breakthrough times were shorter and the times for bed saturation were longer than those obtained with synthetic solution 9 these behaviors can be explained by the continuous and high presence of light metals in the solution which promotes competition for active sites and a multicomponent equilibrium fig 8 shows the biosorption of ni2 and cu2 ions from real effluents that were pre treated and mixed whereas the physicochemical parameters and the detected metal ions are given in table 12 since the total bed saturation has not been achieved after 6 5 days an estimate of the biosorption capacity of cu2 ions was performed to compare with the biosorption capacity predicted by the langmuir model from synthetic solution table 13 the biosorption of ni2 ions decreased significantly in the presence of cu2 ions due to the greater metal biosorbent affinity for cu2 ions which was 80 lower than the biosorption capacity predicted by the langmuir model from synthetic solution in addition the breakthrough curve for ni2 ions was characterized by the presence of an overshoot it occurs when the output concentration exceeds the feed concentration 34 38 such behavior demonstrates that the biosorption of cu2 ions displaces part of ni2 ions simultaneously biosorbed at the beginning on the other hand the results indicate that the biosorption of cu2 ions would be similar to the separated real effluent although the biosorption capacities of ni2 and cu2 were strongly affected by the complexity of the electroplating effluents after chemical precipitation and cyanide oxidation the immobilized biosorbent showed good selectivity for ni2 and cu2 thus the biosorption process using the biosorbent prepared from the brown alga sargassum sp can be effectively applied for removal of heavy metals 4 conclusion the immobilized biosorbent that was prepared from the brown algae sargassum sp can be effectively used for uptake of nickel and copper ions in aqueous solutions the experiments that were performed with low porosity were quite representative each other indicating ease bed packing and good distribution of immobilized biosorbent in the bed equilibrium relations of the biosorption of ni2 and cu2 ions were obtained in continuous system using synthetic solution and they were well adjusted by the langmuir model according to the parameters of the langmuir model the maximum biosorption capacities were 1 404 mmol g 1 for ni2 ions and 1 656 mmol g 1 for cu2 ions the metal loaded biosorbent can be easily regenerated using a small volume of acidified calcium chloride solution the regenerated biosorbent has presented potential to be reused in the biosorption process obtaining on average 75 of the initial biosorption capacity electroplating effluents that were pretreated by chemical precipitation and cyanide oxidation have in their composition high concentrations of light metals such as sodium calcium magnesium and potassium thus the biosorption of ni2 and cu2 ions from real effluents become highly competitive decreasing the biosorption capacities and increasing the mass transfer zone however it is necessary that future studies to evaluate the combination of treatments and the reagents used in order to optimize the biosorption process future works and application of metal biosorption under real conditions should evaluate the combined treatments used reagents as well as other effluent types

cm 2 5 mathematical modeling of the breakthrough curves mathematical modeling has an important role in the scale up process from laboratory experiments to industrial scale suitable models can help to analyze the experimental data identify the mechanisms relevant to the biosorption process predict changes according to different operating conditions optimize the biosorption process 30 in this work to describe the biosorption process of ni2 and cu2 ions by the immobilized biosorbent in fixed bed column the model employed has the following assumptions i axial and radial dispersions are negligible in the fixed bed column ii physical properties of the biosorbent and of the fluid phases are constant iii column void fraction is constant iv process conditions are isothermal and isobaric v the resistance to mass transfer in the outer film is negligible vi a linear driving force ldf is used to describe the concentration profile inside the biosorbent vii the biosorption equilibrium is described by the langmuir isotherm based on the above assumptions the mathematical model was obtained through the mass balance equation for the liquid and solid phases in the fixed bed column the mass balance of the concentration of ni2 and cu2 ions in the fluid phase can be described by eq 4 4 c t u ε c t z z ρ b ε q t z t 0 where c concentration of metal ions mmol l 1 u ε interstitial velocity of

expression eq 7 in order to facilitate the resolution of the differential equations system this model known as linear driving force ldf assumes that driving force of mass transfer for the solid phase

desorption cycles of ni2 and cu2 ions from synthetic solutions experiments on biosorbent regeneration were evaluated over three cycles of biosorption and desorption in fixed bed column the biosorption of ni2 and cu2 ions were performed for the concentration of 1 mmol l 1 solution ph at 4 5 flow rate of 4 ml min 1 and bed height of 30 6 cm a solution of calcium chloride 0 5 m acidified at ph 3 0 with hydrochloric acid was used as eluent in the desorption cycles in order to use a small volume of eluent solution 500 ml the desorption was separated in two steps with a flow rate of 4 ml min 1 the first step was performed in continuous flow due to the large amount of ni2 and cu2 ions desorbed in the initial minutes whereas the second step was performed in recirculated flow to exhaust the desorption capacity of the final eluent volume 140 ml the amount of desorbed metal ions m d can be calculated by the sum the two steps according to the eq 11 11 m d q 1000 0 t c o u t d t c v e where v e is the volume of eluent recirculated ml desorption efficiency e d was calculated by eq 11 12 e d m d m b i o 100 where m b i o is the amount of biosorbed metal ions on biosorbent mmol 2 7 biosorption of ni2 and cu2 ions from electroplating effluent electroplating effluent was collected from an industry in the northwest of parana brazil effluents discharges containing nickel and copper come from the rinse baths after the electrochemical processes in this industry effluent containing nickel or copper was collected separately for each disposal due to the high metal concentration 1500 mg l 1 and the presence of cyanide from the alkaline copper baths the effluents were initially treated by chemical precipitation and cyanide oxidation these treatments were performed with commercial reagents such as hydrated lime type ch1 and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 200 vol to obtain effluents with characteristics similar to the existing treatment conditions in the industry these experiments were carried out in fixed bed columns with constant flow rate of 4 ml min 1 and temperature of 30 c in addition the electroplating effluents were collected in three ways i from nickel disposal only ii from copper disposal only and iii from nickel and copper mixed disposal since real effluents have a complex composition the solutions before and after biosorption were characterized by several parameters and metal species including ph cod sulfate chloride cyanide sodium potassium calcium magnesium nickel copper zinc lead aluminum iron and chromium 3 results and discussions 3 1 biosorption of ni2 and cu2 ions from synthetic solutions the experiments in fixed bed column for the feed concentration of 0 5 3 0 mmol l 1 were performed using similar operating conditions of the bed between the experiments such conditions including dry weight of the biosorbent w d bed porosity ε l and bed density ρ l are given in tables 1 and 2 the mathematical model linear driving force ldf uses the equilibrium relation to determine the biosorption capacity and to simulate the breakthrough curves the equilibrium relations were initially obtained in a batch system and they were well adjusted by the langmuir model as presented by barquilha et al 27 in which the maximum biosorption capacity and the langmuir constant were respectively 1 098 mmol g 1 and 1 100 l mmol 1 for ni2 ions and 1 597 mmol g 1 and 4 087 l mmol 1 for cu2 ions however these equilibrium relations for biosorption of ni2 and cu2 ions provided by the langmuir model in batch have large deviations from experimental results obtained in fixed bed column as shown in the tables 3 and 4 this behavior has been quite common in processes involving ion exchange mechanism according to da silva et al 28 the equilibrium condition in closed system batch is different of that obtained in a continuous system fixed bed column in batch the released ions by the biosorbent remain in the solution and compete with the target ions ni2 and cu2 on the other hand in continuous flow systems the released ions by the biosorbent are continually carried by the feed solution klamer and van krevelen 33 suggested that the equilibrium data for ion exchange processes are obtained in continuous system thus the experimental results in fixed bed column were used to fitted another langmuir isotherm as shown in fig 1 the parameters values obtained by the langmuir isotherm q m a x and b in closed and continuous systems were then compared while the maximum biosorption capacity increased 27 87 for ni2 ions and 3 69 for cu2 ions the constant b that is related metal biosorbent affinity increased 289 18 for ni2 ions and 89 19 for cu2 ions these values are in agreement with the deviations obtained that were higher for the more diluted solutions since for a concentration of target ions tending to infinity the concentration of released ions would become negligible thus the langmuir isotherm fitted to the experimental results in continuous system was used together with the ldf model to simulate the biosorption of ni2 and cu2 ions in fixed bed column as shown in the figs 2 and 3 the uptake capacities the mass transfer coefficients k s and the length of mass transfer zone mtz as well as the determination coefficients r 2 and objective functions f o b j values are given in tables 5 and 6 as shown in the figs 2 and 3 the feed concentration of metal ions has a significant effect on the breakthrough curves when the feed concentration increases both times of breakthrough and saturation decrease due to the higher biosorption rate of the metal ions thus the mtz is an important parameter to scale a fixed bed column in which the highest ratio between the biosorption capacities in the breakthrough point q t b and in the exhaustion point q t s a t corresponds the shortest mtz that is mtz is zero when q t b q t s a t according to mtz values especially for the biosorption of cu2 ions table 6 the increase in the feed concentration did not necessarily increase ztm this behavior was attributed to the increase in the concentration gradient between the biosorbent surface and the solution which improves the drive force for mass transfer and reduces the resistance to film diffusion however the residence time of the solution in the column may not be sufficient to achieve the complete uptake in short mtz at high metal concentration increasing progressively the increase in the feed concentration also results in an increase in the biosorption capacity at the exhaustion point this increase tends to be when the concentrations are high that is in the plateau region of the isotherm in addition the mtz values were lower for cu2 ions than ni2 ions that were attributed to greater affinity for cu2 ions kleinübing et al 34 obtained similar results of the mtz for biosorption of ni2 and cu2 ions on the brown algae sargassum filipendula since the ldf model considers that the driving force for mass transfer is linear with the metal concentration the estimated values of k s as a function of feed concentration of ni2 and cu2 ions can be described by eqs 12 and 13 respectively 12 k s n i 4 72 x 10 4 c n i 4 82 x 10 4 13 k s c u 3 69 x 10 4 c c u 5 07 x 10 4 according to breakthrough curves the ldf model was well adjusted to the experimental results however in the first moments the model predicts output concentrations close to zero for biosorption of cu2 ions that were not reached in the experimental results these behaviors significantly increased the f o b j values the mass transfer coefficient k s values were compared to obtained values in other studies kleinübing et al 35 obtained k s values for ni2 ions within the range of 3 87 10 3 to 9 00 10 3 min 1 while the k s values for cu2 ions were obtained within the range of 1 28 10 3 to 12 29 10 3 min 1 28 35 both biosorption studies were performed using the brown algae sargassum sp as biosorbent in fixed bed columns 3 2 biosorption desorption cycles of ni2 and cu2 ions from synthetic solutions biosorption and desorption cycles of ni2 and cu2 ions were shown in figs 4 and 5 respectively the biosorbent prepared from the brown algae sargassum sp was efficiently used over three cycles of biosorption however the biosorption capacity of ni2 and cu2 ions were slightly reduced the biosorption capacity of ni2 ions was reduced by 21 compared to the initial biosorption capacity it can be attributed to loss of biosorbent mass and changes on active sites as non reversible bonds with h and ca2 ions 25 36 on the other hand the biosorption capacity of cu2 ions was reduced by 28 and it was mainly attributed to the high amount of cu2 ions remaining on the adsorbent due to its great metal biosorbent affinity making desorption difficult e d 74 however although the biosorption capacity of cu2 ions have decreased the breakthrough curves maintained a similar operating time and was mainly affected in the exhaust stage fig 5a as mentioned before the desorption cycles were performed in two steps in order to use a small volume of eluent 500 ml according to figs 4 and 5 the larger amount of desorbed metal ions occurs in the initial minutes of the continuous step and then decreases significantly thus the last volume of eluent 140 ml was recirculated to ensure that its desorption capacity has been exhausted tables 7 and 8 show the mass balances of sorption desorption cycles of ni2 and cu2 ions respectively these results show that the total amount of cu2 ions experimental biosorption capacity q e plus the remaining amount q r on the biosorbent increased after the first biosorption cycle the q r values are the remaining amount of metal accumulated over the cycles this can be attributed to desorption of cu2 ions in the unanalyzed aqueous solution used to rinse the bed after desorption since the remaining amount of cu2 ions on the biosorbents was still high seolatto et al 37 obtained similar results using the brown algae sargassum sp in biosorption desorption cycles of ni2 ions the desorption efficiency using mgso4 h2so4 ph 3 0 as eluent was higher than 95 and the biosorption capacity decreased by 15 in the third biosorption cycle 3 3 biosorption of ni2 and cu2 ions in real effluent from electroplating industry experiments of biosorption of ni2 and cu2 ions in real effluent from electroplating industry were performed in fixed bed columns for operating conditions similar to that used with synthetic solutions in order to compare the obtained results figs 6 and 7 show the breakthrough curves of the biosorption of ni2 and cu2 ions respectively pretreated by chemical precipitation and cyanide oxidation in addition a comparison between the biosorption from real effluents and the synthetic solutions with the closest concentration were added to them tables 9 and 10 exhibit the physicochemical parameters and the detected metals to understand the competitiveness effect on active sites such results were given in units of milligram per liter which are more usual for real effluents the physicochemical parameters cod oil and grease cyanide chloride and sulfate did not present significant differences before and after biosorption and they may not be removed by the biosorbent on the other hand the analyzes of metal ions show that there is a simultaneous removal theses ions reducing the biosorption rate and capacity of ni2 and cu2 ions among the detected ions magnesium mg ions is the one that competes more with the target ions because its concentration decreases considerably at the beginning of the biosorption the concentration of calcium ca ions increased in the output solution because the ca ions are initially bound to the biosorbent and they act as ion exchangers however the amount of calcium ions released from the biosorbent in real effluent is probably less than in synthetic solution since its concentration in real effluent is high and an equilibrium must be established table 11 shows the biosorption capacities of ni2 and cu2 ions obtained from electroplating effluents and the biosorption capacities predicted by langmuir model for synthetic solutions the biosorption capacities from real effluents decreased by 29 69 for ni2 ions and 26 24 for cu2 ions in addition the presence of high concentrations of light metals na k ca and mg in the solution increased the mass transfer zone mtz values as shown in the tables 5 6 and 11 the increase in mtz can also be observed in the breakthrough curves figs 6 and 7b in which the breakthrough times were shorter and the times for bed saturation were longer than those obtained with synthetic solution 9 these behaviors can be explained by the continuous and high presence of light metals in the solution which promotes competition for active sites and a multicomponent equilibrium fig 8 shows the biosorption of ni2 and cu2 ions from real effluents that were pre treated and mixed whereas the physicochemical parameters and the detected metal ions are given in table 12 since the total bed saturation has not been achieved after 6 5 days an estimate of the biosorption capacity of cu2 ions was performed to compare with the biosorption capacity predicted by the langmuir model from synthetic solution table 13 the biosorption of ni2 ions decreased significantly in the presence of cu2 ions due to the greater metal biosorbent affinity for cu2 ions which was 80 lower than the biosorption capacity predicted by the langmuir model from synthetic solution in addition the breakthrough curve for ni2 ions was characterized by the presence of an overshoot it occurs when the output concentration exceeds the feed concentration 34 38 such behavior demonstrates that the biosorption of cu2 ions displaces part of ni2 ions simultaneously biosorbed at the beginning on the other hand the results indicate that the biosorption of cu2 ions would be similar to the separated real effluent although the biosorption capacities of ni2 and cu2 were strongly affected by the complexity of the electroplating effluents after chemical precipitation and cyanide oxidation the immobilized biosorbent showed good selectivity for ni2 and cu2 thus the biosorption process using the biosorbent prepared from the brown alga sargassum sp can be effectively applied for removal of heavy metals 4 conclusion the immobilized biosorbent that was prepared from the brown algae sargassum sp can be effectively used for uptake of nickel and copper ions in aqueous solutions the experiments that were performed with low porosity were quite representative each other indicating ease bed packing and good distribution of immobilized biosorbent in the bed equilibrium relations of the biosorption of ni2 and cu2 ions were obtained in continuous system using synthetic solution and they were well adjusted by the langmuir model according to the parameters of the langmuir model the maximum biosorption capacities were 1 404 mmol g 1 for ni2 ions and 1 656 mmol g 1 for cu2 ions the metal loaded biosorbent can be easily regenerated using a small volume of acidified calcium chloride solution the regenerated biosorbent has presented potential to be reused in the biosorption process obtaining on average 75 of the initial biosorption capacity electroplating effluents that were pretreated by chemical precipitation and cyanide oxidation have in their composition high concentrations of light metals such as sodium calcium magnesium and potassium thus the biosorption of ni2 and cu2 ions from real effluents become highly competitive decreasing the biosorption capacities and increasing the mass transfer zone however it is necessary that future studies to evaluate the combination of treatments and the reagents used in order to optimize the biosorption process future works and application of metal biosorption under real conditions should evaluate the combined treatments used reagents as well as other effluent types

14221,biofiltration is known for its many benefits such as its ability to remove dissolved organic carbon doc and disinfection by product dbp precursors decrease bacterial regrowth in the distribution system all while maintaining desired turbidity removal and controlling taste and odor however the sensitivity of biofilter performance associated with backwash regime is under studied particularly headloss development and particle release a pilot scale study was conducted on two dual media anthracite sand biofilters under warm 15 25 c and cold 0 5 c temperature conditions biofilters were subjected to various backwash regimes including the addition of air scour and extended terminal subfluidization washes etsw to evaluate their effects on headloss development turbidity and particle passage during filter ripening media age was also considered the biofilters were also assessed with respect to organics removal dbp formation and microbial activity headloss was minimized by the addition of air scour and etsw during backwashes by 11 18 the turbidity spike during ripening of 0 35 ntu significantly p 0 05 improved with the addition of single and double stage etsw with maximum turbidity values of 0 14 and 0 09 ntu respectively particle release during ripening followed the same trend with the lowest particle counts observed with a double stage etsw applied during backwashing keywords biofiltration backwash air scour etsw headloss filter ripening 1 introduction filtration has been used as a method to purify water for centuries by removing particulate matter and various pathogenic microorganisms through size exclusion or through particle attachment filtration is often a mandatory step in drinking water treatment facilities with surface water sources and the most common forms include rapid and slow media filtration typical filter media can include sand anthracite activated carbon or a combination of these referred to as dual media filtration many of these facilities typically run with the addition of a chlorinated disinfection step upstream of filtration to assist with eradicating pathogens prevent biofilm growth and reduce taste and odor 1 3 the practice of pre chlorination however results in the formation of disinfection by products dbps due to the reactions of chlorine with organic matter dbps such as haloacetic acids haas and trihalomethanes thms have been found to be a potential cancer risk and therefore strict regulations have been put in place for treatment facilities to abide by 4 5 in order to reduce the formation of dbps some treatment plants have chosen to not pre chlorinate which then allows for biological growth on the filter media biological filtration or biofiltration has the ability to not only maintain desired particulate removal but also to remove a fraction of dissolved organic carbon doc through microbial degradation 6 7 removing some or all of the doc reduces the fraction of organics that could potentially form dbps during the subsequent disinfection stage 6 8 it also leads to a decrease of organics entering the distribution system which can cause bacterial regrowth discoloured water and odour issues 9 while biofiltration has been widely accepted in europe there has been more reluctance in north america to adopt biofiltration as standard practice in drinking water treatment 10 backwashing method is an important design aspect to focus on for any filter to maintain optimal performance levels with regards to water production and turbidity control in a biofiltration system microorganisms form a biofilm matrix on the filter media by secreting adhesive extracellular polymeric substances eps consisting of proteins and polysaccharides 11 13 routine backwashing of biofilters thus not only removed clogged particulates in the filter media but also removes excess biomass that also contributes to bed clogging 14 17 as noted in the review article by slavik et al 18 there is an abundance of research on the effects of different backwashing techniques for conventional filtration practices 18 however the outcomes of various backwashing methods cannot be assumed to be the same for biofilters headloss development in biological filters has been found to be greater than conventional filters due to excess biomass and eps buildup as well as particle accumulation 14 15 17 some studies have explored methods of controlling headloss in biofilters by lowering eps content with chemical additives with nutrient supplementation or hydrogen peroxide for instance 15 19 20 for instance research on headloss control with biofilter backwashing strategies is still limited nyfennegger et al 19 pointed out that biofilters with lower eps concentrations showed a decrease in headloss development therefore researchers have explored ways to minimize eps concentration through phosphorous supplementation and peroxide addition 15 19 20 others have looked at the effect of backwashing on various biofiltration performance aspects but without focusing on headloss such as organics removal biomass quantification and turbidity 21 22 research that examines methods of both biofilter headloss control while also simultaneously considering organics and turbidity removal is still needed another aspect affecting biofiltration that requires more attention is the effect of temperature north america has extremely variable temperature conditions that water treatment plants must take into consideration when implementing biofiltration biological activity is hindered at colder temperatures and many studies have reported decreased organics removals at temperatures below 5 c 1 23 25 most existing research has focused on the impact temperature has on microbial activity and organics removals but there is a lack of information on the impact cold temperatures may have on headloss development and particle passage as well as how backwashing strategies are impacted at lower temperatures this drinking water biofiltration research investigates multiple backwash strategies under warm and cold temperatures and examines subsequent impacts on headloss development filter turbidity and particle release during the subsequent filter ripening period further this research aims to ensure that any identified beneficial backwash strategies do not interfere with doc or dbp removals 2 methods materials 2 1 pilot plant setup the experiments were conducted on a pilot scale system at the britannia water purification plant in ottawa ontario outlined in fig 1 the pilot plant consists of two dual media biofilter columns 6 in in diameter and made from glass named biofilter 1 bf1 and biofilter 2 bf2 the pilot filters were built over 20 years ago and have been operating as biofilters since they contain approximately 635 mm of anthracite on top of 375 mm of silica sand bf1 contains sand from 1962 d10 0 5 and uc 1 3 and anthracite from 1986 d10 0 94 and uc 1 6 where bf2 contains 5 year old sand d10 0 5 and uc 1 6 and anthracite d10 1 04 and uc 1 4 the d10 value is also known as the effective size and represents the 10th percentile size of the media while uc is the uniformity coefficient which is the ratio of the d10 to d60 value flow through the columns was controlled at 2 6 m h 0 8 l min designed to mimic the plant s full scale conditions with an ebct of 23 min the influent flow rate is controlled manually and an overflow drain ensured the flow rate to the columns stayed constant the water fed to the filters came directly from the settled water basins in the full scale facilities raw water from the ottawa river undergoes screening aluminum sulphate aided coagulation and flocculation followed by sedimentation the settled water then moves onto filtration a portion of which is sent to the pilot plant filters 2 2 experimental phases backwashing and sampling schedule this study was split into two phases warm water conditions 18 weeks and cold water conditions 12 weeks phase 1 ran from september to mid october 2017 and june to august 2018 with water temperatures ranging from 15 to 25 c phase 2 ran from january to april 2018 with water temperatures of 0 5 c filters were initially conditioned for 3 months prior to the start of each phase and maintained throughout the duration of the study during each phase backwashing occurred twice per week every 3 4 days backwash refers to the reversal of water flow through the filter bed to remove accumulated material backwash regimes applied to the biofilters were performed between 3 12 times each and are summarized in table 1 effluent and influent water samples were collected immediately before backwashing and 24 h after backwashing during phases 1 and 2 all water samples were collected in 250 ml acid washed amber glass jars media samples were collected from the top of both biofilters in sterile 15 ml polyethylene tubes before and after backwashing once per week 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 headloss pressure head in each column was measured using a pressure indicator rosemount at the plant data was recorded at the pilot plant in centimeters at 1 min intervals headloss at various times after backwashing was performed was determined by subtracting the recorded head measurement at the desired times from the starting value recorded immediately after a backwash 2 3 2 particle counts particle counts of influent and effluent water samples were carried out with a dynamic particle analyzer bp 4100 hev by brightwell technologies inc the flow cell used bp 1400 fc 100 u was able to detect particles sized from 0 75 to 100 μm for each sample analyzed the flow cell was thoroughly rinsed with milliq water filtered with a 0 45 μm filter paper to ensure there were no particles the flow cell was inverted several times during this rinsing to remove any air bubbles from the system the syringe was then filled with sample and analysis could begin every few samples along with flushing the flow cell with di water a cleaning solution was introduced 50 pcc54 detergent by volume followed by a final rinse with di water until no residual particles or cleaning solution was left water samples for ripening particle count analysis were conducted on bf2 only and were collected at 5 10 15 25 45 60 and 70 min after backwashes 2 3 3 turbidity influent and effluent turbidity was continuously monitored by hach inline 1720 e low range turbidimeters detection limit 0 0032 ntu installed at the pilot plant data was obtained at an interval of every 1 min 2 3 4 microbial methods biofilm activity and structure was quantified by measuring atp and eps concentrations on the media samples atp tests were conducted with 1 g of wet media sample following the deposit and surface analysis test kit method from luminultra technologies and measurements were read using a luminometer eps was first extracted from 2 g of wet media sample by means of a cation exchange resin method 11 and then analyzed for polysaccharide and protein concentrations polysaccharides were analyzed using a phenol sulphuric acid assay 26 and proteins by a modified lowry assay using the peirce bca test kit a scanning electron microscope sem was used to produce close up images of anthracite media samples an imaging software imagej was used to analyze shapes and sizes of anthracite particles in the filter 2 3 5 organics analysis doc analysis was conducted by the persulfate ultraviolet oxidation method as described in u s epa method 415 3 35 using a shimadzu toc vcph cpn total organic carbon analyzer before each analysis samples were filtered through a 0 45 μm filter dbps were analyzed by performing a lab scale simulation of the disinfection process that occurs in the full scale plant s contact chamber post filtration this was done by dosing samples with a hypochlorite solution to achieve a free chlorine residual of 1 4 1 6 mg l chlorine residual was tested using a hach dr1900 portable spectrophotometer and hach low range 0 2 ppm powder pillows for 10 ml samples once the desired dose was reached the samples were stored headspace free for a contact time of 1 h in a dark this contact time was chosen to mimic operations at the full scale plant after one hour the samples were tested for residual free chlorine with the goal of 1 mg l and then transferred into 40 ml amber glass tubes with preservatives ammonium chloride for haas and sodium thiosulfate for thms to stop any further reactions haas were further analyzed using the u s epa method 552 2 27 and tthms were measured by u s epa method 524 4 28 3 results discussion 3 1 headloss development however the impact various backwashing strategies on headloss development in biofilters is still under studied amburgey 29 briefly explored headloss development for the addition of air scour and etsw on conventional filters but didn t find any significant differences this study has explored various backwashing conditions on headloss development in biofilters at warm 15 25 c and cold 0 5 c temperatures in phases 1 and 2 of the experiment bf1 received water only washes and bf2 received water plus air scour preliminary analysis of the headloss data indicated that bf2 had consistently greater headloss than that of bf1 fig 2 shows correlations of headloss with various microbial measurements where it can be clearly observed that in all cases bf2 the biofilter with the greater headloss did not have larger proportions of proteins polysaccharides or atp concentrations additionally in this study proteins overall correlated strongest with headloss measurements with r2 values of 0 87 and 0 63 for bf1 and bf2 respectively this tells us that the protein component of eps is likely a key contributor to headloss development in biofilters as can be noted in fig 2 when both biofilters contain similar protein values bf2 still experiences consistently greater headloss development and thus biomass development was not the sole contributor to headloss differences between bf1 and bf2 media age may then be a significant parameter to further investigate bf1 is comprised of anthracite that is approximately 30 years old while bf2 contains anthracite form a relatively recent plant upgrade and is less than 5 years old sem images of the anthracite media in the respective columns were taken and revealed differences in the media shape with age fig 3 it is apparent that the old anthracite has been rounded and smoothed over the years and all pieces seem to be of fairly uniform size similar to smoothed rocks found at beaches the new anthracite on the other hand is more angular in shape with sharp edges and a combination of large pieces with smaller sized fragments differences in particle surface areas a and perimeter p were confirmed using imaging software imagej with the sem images bf1 old media had particle areas ranging from 1 5 2 9 mm2 whereas bf2 new media had particles with areas as low as 0 38 mm2 and up to 2 6 mm2 next sphericity φ was calculated using eq 1 1 ϕ 4 π a p 2 bf1 has a an average sphericity value of 0 83 range 0 75 0 87 while he more angular media in bf2 has an average sphericity value of 0 55 range 0 45 0 63 utilizing the carman kozeny eq 2 for clean bed headloss the shape factor and particle diameter d are both inversely proportional to headloss δh median particle diameters for both filter media were estimated using imagej software with diameter values of 1 64 and 1 03 mm for bf1 and bf2 respectively the remaining variables were the same for both filters filtration rate vo of 2 6 m h porosity ε of 0 55 anthracite bed length δl of 0 635 m viscosity and density of water at 20 c clean bed headloss was found to be 0 7 and 3 3 cm for bf1 and bf2 respectively 2 h l 228 v o μ ρ g ϕ 2 d 2 1 ε 2 ε 3 this analysis demonstrates a clear importance of tracking protein levels in filters for headloss development and also highlights the necessity of keeping track of media differences i e changes in particle shape and size between filters at a given plant in particular when engaging in optimization activities fig 4 a and b plot the average headloss trends up to 72 h after backwashing for both biofilters under all backwash regimes in warm 15 25 c temperature conditions fig 4 c and d show average headloss trends under cold 0 5 c temperature conditions where limited backwash strategies were applied the observed changes in headloss for various backwashes are more apparent in bf2 compared to bf1 which highlights that newer media or media with lower sphericity values may benefit from changes in backwash strategy more than filters with older media bf2 experienced the greatest headloss when washed with water only at 30 cm accumulated after 72 h headloss in both biofilters under cold temperatures was higher overall as expected due to the increase in the water s viscosity μ which is directly proportional to headloss see eq 2 the addition of etsw under these conditions however proved to be ineffective at minimizing headloss with consistent results for both bf1 and bf2 with and without etsw at 7 6 m h since both bf1 and bf2 experienced the greatest headloss under warm conditions when backwashed with water only this was used as a base to compare the reductions that other backwashing strategies had on the headloss development these results are summarized in fig 5 the largest reductions were observed with the addition of both air scour and etsw bf1 experienced the greatest headloss reduction of 19 on average when exposed to the water plus air scour and a double stage etsw where bf2 experienced an 18 reduction on average in headloss when washed with water plus air and a single stage etsw the improvement in headloss with air scour and etsw addition is likely attributed to the increased removal of trapped particles and excess biomass when these practices are applied during backwashing the additional abrasions and contact throughout the media that is achieved with air scour paired with a subfluidization rate that maximizes trapped particle removal is sure to have the greatest impact on minimizing headloss development in the columns post backwash however with the promising trend in headloss reduction using air scour and etsw it is worth further investigation in future research 3 2 particle counts turbidity biofilters accumulate biological and non biological particles that have the potential to detach and come out through the filter effluent 30 a closer examination of backwash strategy impact on particle release and turbidity in the filter effluent may help ensure a more confident selection and recommendation of backwash regimes with biofilters in this study particle removal through the biofilters was assessed by analyzing the average total particle counts from 0 75 to 100 μm in the influent and effluent samples from the biofilters during regular operation to compare the effect of cold temperatures on particle counts average particle counts ml from samples before backwash and 24 h after backwash compared to influent concentrations are shown in the table 2 for both warm and cold temperatures under warm water temperature conditions both biofilters behaved fairly similarly overall in terms of particle removal between backwashes thus difference in media shape were not significant enough to impact particle removal total particle removals before backwashing were 77 for bf1 and 78 for bf2 this is comparable to the removals observed by persson et al 31 for full scale gac biofilters which were 60 90 of total particle counts at 20 c there was no observed difference between effluent particle counts in samples from before and 24 h after backwashing when etsw was applied versus without etsw effluent particle counts for the pilot biofilters were in accordance with full scale plant results at the study location under warm temperature conditions total particle count removal rates decreased under cold water conditions for both biofilters the influent particle counts stay consistent throughout seasons in all size ranges however the removal of total particles exhibited by the pilot biofilters under cold conditions is significantly less p 0 05 than under warm conditions bf1 removed only 60 of total particles on average before backwashing and improved to 65 24 h after backwashing bf2 on the other hand performed worse under cold temperature conditions with an average total particle removal of 54 before backwashing but improved to 63 24 h after backwashing this increase in effluent particle counts under cold temperatures was only observed in the pilot biofilters and samples from the full scale filters showed minimal deviation from the warm temperature results this increase however is still concerning and it is difficult to find many comparisons as there is limited literature in this area of research future studies should continue to look into biofilter particle release under cold temperature conditions particle and turbidity monitoring are especially important during the filter ripening period post backwash to ensure that the risks of harmful pathogens such as cryptosporidium and giardia being released into the filter effluents are mitigated amburgey 29 brought forth etsw as a method of minimizing filter ripening in conventional filters and proposed it could be used on biofilters as well research with etsw and biofilters has been somewhat limited to explore the effects of etsw even further on biofiltration this study analyzed effluent particle counts as well as turbidity for single and double stage etsw backwashes during filter ripening for bf2 only with the results summarized in fig 6 average peak turbidity after ripening with the absence of etsw was observed to be 0 355 ntu at 25 min when an etsw step of 13 2 m h for 7 min was added to the backwash procedure this peak at 25 min was significantly p 0 05 reduced to 0 142 ntu it is important to note that although this spike in turbidity is fairly minor there is no observed spike in the full scale facilities when an etsw at an equivalent rate and duration is used this slight increase is most likely due to the manual nature of the pilot plant valves must be opened and closed manually which does not allow for a seamless transition like in the full scale filters with automated valves flow to the turbidimeters must also be restarted manually upon every backwash and the small delay caused by these issues may be reflected in this slight observed turbidity spike when the double stage etsw was applied to the backwash regime in the pilot plant however the observed peak at 25 min was eliminated with turbidity values remaining below 0 1 ntu the entire time post backwash regardless of the valve changes and delay in restarting the turbidimeters ikhlef and basu 21 observed similar trends in their bench scale biofilter experiments but with overall greater effluent turbidities of 0 6 1 2 ntu when etsw was absent and 0 2 0 3 ntu when it was applied with a water wash at 20 bed expansion amburgey and ammirtharajah 32 observed more similar turbidity values in conventional filters turbidity from 0 15 to 3 8 ntu without etsw decreased to values remaining below 0 1 ntu with its addition median total particle counts showed similar trends for the various backwash strategies applied when compared to turbidity without etsw peak particle counts on average were approximately 5 000 ml at 25 and 45 min after backwash this was reduced greatly when a single stage etsw was applied with particle counts remaining around 2 000 ml for 0 70 min post backwash the double stage etsw reduced overall particle counts even further with concentrations lowering from 2 000 ml to 1 000 ml 15 min after backwash and then remaining at 1 000 ml for the remainder of samples the variance between samples was particularly at 25 and 45 min without etsw notably the variance in particle counts decreased when both single and double stage etsw were applied table 3 summarizes the particle count results separated into specific size fractions important size ranges to analyze are 3 8 μm for cryptosporidium oocysts and 8 15 μm for giardia cysts when etsw is absent during backwashing the particle count at 3 8 μm peaks at 1116 particles ml 45 min after backwash whereas when a single or double stage etsw is applied there is no observed peak at the 45 min mark with a single stage etsw the maximum observed concentration for 3 8 μm is 706 ml and this maximum drops to 528 ml with the double stage etsw for the 8 15 μm size range the elevated levels observed without etsw and with single stage etsw were similar at 192 and 173 ml respectively whereas the double stage etsw had a notable drop to 70 ml the double stage required an additional 42 l of water during these experiments to achieve the presented results it is worth exploring in future research optimal subfluidization rates and durations for a double stage etsw to minimize water usage while maintaining desired turbidity and particle counts during ripening 3 3 organics removal dbp formation water quality parameters including organics removal and dbp formations were also assessed for any influence from varying backwash protocols and from temperature changes between phase 1 warm water 15 25 c and phase 2 cold water 0 5 c fig 7 represents doc removal in the columns as percentages in a box and whisker plot the bolded line represents the median value between the bottom and top of the box which are the 25th and 75th percentiles respectively although mean doc removals were low the biofilters performed similarly under all conditions there was no apparent difference between the two biofilters indicating that neither air scour nor media age impacted doc removal the low doc removals could be attributed to both nutrient limiting conditions of the filter influent c n p ratio of 1000 55 1 by weight and that pre ozonation is not practiced at the britannia plant it has been reported that a c n p ratio of 39 4 5 1 is required for optimal biofiltration performance and that pre ozonation is known to improve the biodegradability of organics 33 36 no significant differences for either biofilter were observed under the conditions tested with average removals around 4 while some studies have exhibited decreased biodegradation rates at low temperature conditions 23 31 others have also reported no change in removals between seasons for anthracite sand biofilters 1 22 ikhlef and basu 21 reported drops in doc at high bed expansions in a lab scale study no other studies could be found examining this topic even small fractions of doc removal have been found to influence dbp formation in water treatment plants to assess the reduction in dbp formation potential of the britannia pilot scale biofilters influent and effluent samples were subjected to a simulation of the on site full scale disinfection processes fig 8 represents the concentrations of haa9 and total thms tthms in the influent versus bf1 and bf2 effluents for both warm and cold temperature conditions both biofilters behaved similarly in terms of dbp formation throughout warm and cold water conditions regardless of air scour or etsw addition under warm temperatures 15 25 c fig 8 a and c the biofilters removed a significant portion of dbp precursors p 0 05 with both bf1 and bf2 having decreased haa9 and tthm concentrations when compared to the influent by 29 and 18 respectively removals were lower under cold water conditions with significant p 0 05 tthm removals of 15 and haa9 removals of 12 influent dbp formations were significantly lower p 0 05 under cold temperature conditions 0 5 c with haa9 concentrations of 22 4 μg l compared to 36 9 μg l under warm water conditions and tthm concentrations of 14 5 μg l versus 26 4 μg l under warm water conditions although the doc removals were similar at both temperature conditions source water composition can vary drastically often containing less humic acids in the winter cold water conditions which are known dbp precursors 8 despite the elevated dbp levels during the warm water phase influent and effluent dbp levels remained well below canada s regulatory limits with max allowable concentrations of 100 μg l and 80 μg l for tthms and haas respectively 34 4 conclusions a pilot scale biofiltration system was used to investigate the effects of backwashing with air scour along with single and double stage etsw on doc and dbp removal headloss development and filter ripening the following conclusions can be made from the presented results backwash strategy impacted headloss development in the following order from greatest control to least i air scour single or double stage etsw ii air scour iii water etsw iv water only adjustment of backwash strategy and associated headloss control was more significant under warm water conditions a double stage etsw can reduce turbidity and total particle counts in effluent water during filter ripening but should be explored further for optimal rates and durations for minimal water usage doc removals remained consistent regardless of backwash strategy media age or water temperature conditions dbp concentrations in both biofilter effluents were well below canadian national regulatory limits they were reduced by 18 versus 15 for tthms and 29 versus 12 for haas in warm versus cold water respectively when compared to the biofilter influent media age only explicitly affected headloss development and had no effect on other studied parameters ackowledgements the authors would like to acknowledge the natural sciences and engineering research council of canada for

14221,biofiltration is known for its many benefits such as its ability to remove dissolved organic carbon doc and disinfection by product dbp precursors decrease bacterial regrowth in the distribution system all while maintaining desired turbidity removal and controlling taste and odor however the sensitivity of biofilter performance associated with backwash regime is under studied particularly headloss development and particle release a pilot scale study was conducted on two dual media anthracite sand biofilters under warm 15 25 c and cold 0 5 c temperature conditions biofilters were subjected to various backwash regimes including the addition of air scour and extended terminal subfluidization washes etsw to evaluate their effects on headloss development turbidity and particle passage during filter ripening media age was also considered the biofilters were also assessed with respect to organics removal dbp formation and microbial activity headloss was minimized by the addition of air scour and etsw during backwashes by 11 18 the turbidity spike during ripening of 0 35 ntu significantly p 0 05 improved with the addition of single and double stage etsw with maximum turbidity values of 0 14 and 0 09 ntu respectively particle release during ripening followed the same trend with the lowest particle counts observed with a double stage etsw applied during backwashing keywords biofiltration backwash air scour etsw headloss filter ripening 1 introduction filtration has been used as a method to purify water for centuries by removing particulate matter and various pathogenic microorganisms through size exclusion or through particle attachment filtration is often a mandatory step in drinking water treatment facilities with surface water sources and the most common forms include rapid and slow media filtration typical filter media can include sand anthracite activated carbon or a combination of these referred to as dual media filtration many of these facilities typically run with the addition of a chlorinated disinfection step upstream of filtration to assist with eradicating pathogens prevent biofilm growth and reduce taste and odor 1 3 the practice of pre chlorination however results in the formation of disinfection by products dbps due to the reactions of chlorine with organic matter dbps such as haloacetic acids haas and trihalomethanes thms have been found to be a potential cancer risk and therefore strict regulations have been put in place for treatment facilities to abide by 4 5 in order to reduce the formation of dbps some treatment plants have chosen to not pre chlorinate which then allows for biological growth on the filter media biological filtration or biofiltration has the ability to not only maintain desired particulate removal but also to remove a fraction of dissolved organic carbon doc through microbial degradation 6 7 removing some or all of the doc reduces the fraction of organics that could potentially form dbps during the subsequent disinfection stage 6 8 it also leads to a decrease of organics entering the distribution system which can cause bacterial regrowth discoloured water and odour issues 9 while biofiltration has been widely accepted in europe there has been more reluctance in north america to adopt biofiltration as standard practice in drinking water treatment 10 backwashing method is an important design aspect to focus on for any filter to maintain optimal performance levels with regards to water production and turbidity control in a biofiltration system microorganisms form a biofilm matrix on the filter media by secreting adhesive extracellular polymeric substances eps consisting of proteins and polysaccharides 11 13 routine backwashing of biofilters thus not only removed clogged particulates in the filter media but also removes excess biomass that also contributes to bed clogging 14 17 as noted in the review article by slavik et al 18 there is an abundance of research on the effects of different backwashing techniques for conventional filtration practices 18 however the outcomes of various backwashing methods cannot be assumed to be the same for biofilters headloss development in biological filters has been found to be greater than conventional filters due to excess biomass and eps buildup as well as particle accumulation 14 15 17 some studies have explored methods of controlling headloss in biofilters by lowering eps content with chemical additives with nutrient supplementation or hydrogen peroxide for instance 15 19 20 for instance research on headloss control with biofilter backwashing strategies is still limited nyfennegger et al 19 pointed out that biofilters with lower eps concentrations showed a decrease in headloss development therefore researchers have explored ways to minimize eps concentration through phosphorous supplementation and peroxide addition 15 19 20 others have looked at the effect of backwashing on various biofiltration performance aspects but without focusing on headloss such as organics removal biomass quantification and turbidity 21 22 research that examines methods of both biofilter headloss control while also simultaneously considering organics and turbidity removal is still needed another aspect affecting biofiltration that requires more attention is the effect of temperature north america has extremely variable temperature conditions that water treatment plants must take into consideration when implementing biofiltration biological activity is hindered at colder temperatures and many studies have reported decreased organics removals at temperatures below 5 c 1 23 25 most existing research has focused on the impact temperature has on microbial activity and organics removals but there is a lack of information on the impact cold temperatures may have on headloss development and particle passage as well as how backwashing strategies are impacted at lower temperatures this drinking water biofiltration research investigates multiple backwash strategies under warm and cold temperatures and examines subsequent impacts on headloss development filter turbidity and particle release during the subsequent filter ripening period further this research aims to ensure that any identified beneficial backwash strategies do not interfere with doc or dbp removals 2 methods materials 2 1 pilot plant setup the experiments were conducted on a pilot scale system at the britannia water purification plant in ottawa ontario outlined in fig 1 the pilot plant consists of two dual media biofilter columns 6 in in diameter and made from glass named biofilter 1 bf1 and biofilter 2 bf2 the pilot filters were built over 20 years ago and have been operating as biofilters since they contain approximately 635 mm of anthracite on top of 375 mm of silica sand bf1 contains sand from 1962 d10 0 5 and uc 1 3 and anthracite from 1986 d10 0 94 and uc 1 6 where bf2 contains 5 year old sand d10 0 5 and uc 1 6 and anthracite d10 1 04 and uc 1 4 the d10 value is also known as the effective size and represents the 10th percentile size of the media while uc is the uniformity coefficient which is the ratio of the d10 to d60 value flow through the columns was controlled at 2 6 m h 0 8 l min designed to mimic the plant s full scale conditions with an ebct of 23 min the influent flow rate is controlled manually and an overflow drain ensured the flow rate to the columns stayed constant the water fed to the filters came directly from the settled water basins in the full scale facilities raw water from the ottawa river undergoes screening aluminum sulphate aided coagulation and flocculation followed by sedimentation the settled water then moves onto filtration a portion of which is sent to the pilot plant filters 2 2 experimental phases backwashing and sampling schedule this study was split into two phases warm water conditions 18 weeks and cold water conditions 12 weeks phase 1 ran from september to mid october 2017 and june to august 2018 with water temperatures ranging from 15 to 25 c phase 2 ran from january to april 2018 with water temperatures of 0 5 c filters were initially conditioned for 3 months prior to the start of each phase and maintained throughout the duration of the study during each phase backwashing occurred twice per week every 3 4 days backwash refers to the reversal of water flow through the filter bed to remove accumulated material backwash regimes applied to the biofilters were performed between 3 12 times each and are summarized in table 1 effluent and influent water samples were collected immediately before backwashing and 24 h after backwashing during phases 1 and 2 all water samples were collected in 250 ml acid washed amber glass jars media samples were collected from the top of both biofilters in sterile 15 ml polyethylene tubes before and after backwashing once per week 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 headloss pressure head in each column was measured using a pressure indicator rosemount at the plant data was recorded at the pilot plant in centimeters at 1 min intervals headloss at various times after backwashing was performed was determined by subtracting the recorded head measurement at the desired times from the starting value recorded immediately after a backwash 2 3 2 particle counts particle counts of influent and effluent water samples were carried out with a dynamic particle analyzer bp 4100 hev by brightwell technologies inc the flow cell used bp 1400 fc 100 u was able to detect particles sized from 0 75 to 100 μm for each sample analyzed the flow cell was thoroughly rinsed with milliq water filtered with a 0 45 μm filter paper to ensure there were no particles the flow cell was inverted several times during this rinsing to remove any air bubbles from the system the syringe was then filled with sample and analysis could begin every few samples along with flushing the flow cell with di water a cleaning solution was introduced 50 pcc54 detergent by volume followed by a final rinse with di water until no residual particles or cleaning solution was left water samples for ripening particle count analysis were conducted on bf2 only and were collected at 5 10 15 25 45 60 and 70 min after backwashes 2 3 3 turbidity influent and effluent turbidity was continuously monitored by hach inline 1720 e low range turbidimeters detection limit 0 0032 ntu installed at the pilot plant data was obtained at an interval of every 1 min 2 3 4 microbial methods biofilm activity and structure was quantified by measuring atp and eps concentrations on the media samples atp tests were conducted with 1 g of wet media sample following the deposit and surface analysis test kit method from luminultra technologies and measurements were read using a luminometer eps was first extracted from 2 g of wet media sample by means of a cation exchange resin method 11 and then analyzed for polysaccharide and protein concentrations polysaccharides were analyzed using a phenol sulphuric acid assay 26 and proteins by a modified lowry assay using the peirce bca test kit a scanning electron microscope sem was used to produce close up images of anthracite media samples an imaging software imagej was used to analyze shapes and sizes of anthracite particles in the filter 2 3 5 organics analysis doc analysis was conducted by the persulfate ultraviolet oxidation method as described in u s epa method 415 3 35 using a shimadzu toc vcph cpn total organic carbon analyzer before each analysis samples were filtered through a 0 45 μm filter dbps were analyzed by performing a lab scale simulation of the disinfection process that occurs in the full scale plant s contact chamber post filtration this was done by dosing samples with a hypochlorite solution to achieve a free chlorine residual of 1 4 1 6 mg l chlorine residual was tested using a hach dr1900 portable spectrophotometer and hach low range 0 2 ppm powder pillows for 10 ml samples once the desired dose was reached the samples were stored headspace free for a contact time of 1 h in a dark this contact time was chosen to mimic operations at the full scale plant after one hour the samples were tested for residual free chlorine with the goal of 1 mg l and then transferred into 40 ml amber glass tubes with preservatives ammonium chloride for haas and sodium thiosulfate for thms to stop any further reactions haas were further analyzed using the u s epa method 552 2 27 and tthms were measured by u s epa method 524 4 28 3 results discussion 3 1 headloss development however the impact various backwashing strategies on headloss development in biofilters is still under studied amburgey 29 briefly explored headloss development for the addition of air scour and etsw on conventional filters but didn t find any significant differences this study has explored various backwashing conditions on headloss development in biofilters at warm 15 25 c and cold 0 5 c temperatures in phases 1 and 2 of the experiment bf1 received water only washes and bf2 received water plus air scour preliminary analysis of the headloss data indicated that bf2 had consistently greater headloss than that of bf1 fig 2 shows correlations of headloss with various microbial measurements where it can be clearly observed that in all cases bf2 the biofilter with the greater headloss did not have larger proportions of proteins polysaccharides or atp concentrations additionally in this study proteins overall correlated strongest with headloss measurements with r2 values of 0 87 and 0 63 for bf1 and bf2 respectively this tells us that the protein component of eps is likely a key contributor to headloss development in biofilters as can be noted in fig 2 when both biofilters contain similar protein values bf2 still experiences consistently greater headloss development and thus biomass development was not the sole contributor to headloss differences between bf1 and bf2 media age may then be a significant parameter to further investigate bf1 is comprised of anthracite that is approximately 30 years old while bf2 contains anthracite form a relatively recent plant upgrade and is less than 5 years old sem images of the anthracite media in the respective columns were taken and revealed differences in the media shape with age fig 3 it is apparent that the old anthracite has been rounded and smoothed over the years and all pieces seem to be of fairly uniform size similar to smoothed rocks found at beaches the new anthracite on the other hand is more angular in shape with sharp edges and a combination of large pieces with smaller sized fragments differences in particle surface areas a and perimeter p were confirmed using imaging software imagej with the sem images bf1 old media had particle areas ranging from 1 5 2 9 mm2 whereas bf2 new media had particles with areas as low as 0 38 mm2 and up to 2 6 mm2 next sphericity φ was calculated using eq 1 1 ϕ 4 π a p 2 bf1 has a an average sphericity value of 0 83 range 0 75 0 87 while he more angular media in bf2 has an average sphericity value of 0 55 range 0 45 0 63 utilizing the carman kozeny eq 2 for clean bed headloss the shape factor and particle diameter d are both inversely proportional to headloss δh median particle diameters for both filter media were estimated using imagej software with diameter values of 1 64 and 1 03 mm for bf1 and bf2 respectively the remaining variables were the same for both filters filtration rate vo of 2 6 m h porosity ε of 0 55 anthracite bed length δl of 0 635 m viscosity and density of water at 20 c clean bed headloss was found to be 0 7 and 3 3 cm for bf1 and bf2 respectively 2 h l 228 v o μ ρ g ϕ 2 d 2 1 ε 2 ε 3 this analysis demonstrates a clear importance of tracking protein levels in filters for headloss development and also highlights the necessity of keeping track of media differences i e changes in particle shape and size between filters at a given plant in particular when engaging in optimization activities fig 4 a and b plot the average headloss trends up to 72 h after backwashing for both biofilters under all backwash regimes in warm 15 25 c temperature conditions fig 4 c and d show average headloss trends under cold 0 5 c temperature conditions where limited backwash strategies were applied the observed changes in headloss for various backwashes are more apparent in bf2 compared to bf1 which highlights that newer media or media with lower sphericity values may benefit from changes in backwash strategy more than filters with older media bf2 experienced the greatest headloss when washed with water only at 30 cm accumulated after 72 h headloss in both biofilters under cold temperatures was higher overall as expected due to the increase in the water s viscosity μ which is directly proportional to headloss see eq 2 the addition of etsw under these conditions however proved to be ineffective at minimizing headloss with consistent results for both bf1 and bf2 with and without etsw at 7 6 m h since both bf1 and bf2 experienced the greatest headloss under warm conditions when backwashed with water only this was used as a base to compare the reductions that other backwashing strategies had on the headloss development these results are summarized in fig 5 the largest reductions were observed with the addition of both air scour and etsw bf1 experienced the greatest headloss reduction of 19 on average when exposed to the water plus air scour and a double stage etsw where bf2 experienced an 18 reduction on average in headloss when washed with water plus air and a single stage etsw the improvement in headloss with air scour and etsw addition is likely attributed to the increased removal of trapped particles and excess biomass when these practices are applied during backwashing the additional abrasions and contact throughout the media that is achieved with air scour paired with a subfluidization rate that maximizes trapped particle removal is sure to have the greatest impact on minimizing headloss development in the columns post backwash however with the promising trend in headloss reduction using air scour and etsw it is worth further investigation in future research 3 2 particle

single or double stage etsw is applied there is no observed peak at the 45 min mark with a single stage etsw the maximum observed concentration for 3 8 μm is 706 ml and this maximum drops to 528 ml with the double stage etsw for the 8 15 μm size range the elevated levels observed without etsw and with single stage etsw were similar at 192 and 173 ml respectively whereas the double stage etsw had a notable drop to 70 ml the double stage required an additional 42 l of water during these experiments to achieve the presented results it is worth exploring in future research optimal subfluidization rates and durations for a double stage etsw to minimize water usage while maintaining desired turbidity and particle counts during ripening 3 3 organics removal dbp formation water quality parameters including organics removal and dbp formations were also assessed for any influence from varying backwash protocols and from temperature changes between phase 1 warm water 15 25 c and phase 2 cold water 0 5 c fig 7 represents doc removal in the columns as percentages in a box and whisker plot the bolded line represents the median value between the bottom and top of the box which are the 25th and 75th percentiles respectively although mean doc removals were low the biofilters performed similarly under all conditions there was no apparent difference between the two biofilters indicating that neither air scour nor media age impacted doc removal the low doc removals could be attributed to both nutrient limiting conditions of the filter influent c n p ratio of 1000 55 1 by weight and that pre ozonation is not practiced at the britannia plant it has been reported that a c n p ratio of 39 4 5 1 is required for optimal biofiltration performance and that pre ozonation is known to improve the biodegradability of organics 33 36 no significant differences for either biofilter were observed under the conditions tested with average removals around 4 while some studies have exhibited decreased biodegradation rates at low temperature conditions 23 31 others have also reported no change in removals between seasons for anthracite sand biofilters 1 22 ikhlef and basu 21 reported drops in doc at high bed expansions in a lab scale study no other studies could be found examining this topic even small fractions of doc removal have been found to influence dbp formation in water treatment plants to assess the reduction in dbp formation potential of the britannia pilot scale biofilters influent and effluent samples were subjected to a simulation of the on site full scale disinfection processes fig 8 represents the concentrations of haa9 and total thms tthms in the influent versus bf1 and bf2 effluents for both warm and cold temperature conditions both biofilters behaved similarly in terms of dbp formation throughout warm and cold water conditions regardless of air scour or etsw addition under warm temperatures 15 25 c fig 8 a and c the biofilters removed a significant portion of dbp precursors p 0 05 with both bf1 and bf2 having decreased haa9 and tthm concentrations when compared to the influent by 29 and 18 respectively removals were lower under cold water conditions with significant p 0 05 tthm removals of 15 and haa9 removals of 12 influent dbp formations were significantly lower p 0 05 under cold temperature conditions 0 5 c with haa9 concentrations of 22 4 μg l compared to 36 9 μg l under warm water conditions and tthm concentrations of 14 5 μg l versus 26 4 μg l under warm water conditions although the doc removals were similar at both temperature conditions source water composition can vary drastically often containing less humic acids in the winter cold water conditions which are known dbp precursors 8 despite the elevated dbp levels during the warm water phase influent and effluent dbp levels remained well below canada s regulatory limits with max allowable concentrations of 100 μg l and 80 μg l for tthms and haas respectively 34 4 conclusions a pilot scale biofiltration system was used to investigate the effects of backwashing with air scour along with single and double stage etsw on doc and dbp removal headloss development and filter ripening the following conclusions can be made from the presented results backwash strategy impacted headloss development in the following order from greatest control to least i air scour single or double stage etsw ii air scour iii water etsw iv water only adjustment of backwash strategy and associated headloss control was more significant under warm water conditions a double stage etsw can reduce turbidity and total particle counts in effluent water during filter ripening but should be explored further for optimal rates and durations for minimal water usage doc removals remained consistent regardless of backwash strategy media age or water temperature conditions dbp concentrations in both biofilter effluents were well below canadian national regulatory limits they were reduced by 18 versus 15 for tthms and 29 versus 12 for haas in warm versus cold water respectively when compared to the biofilter influent media age only explicitly affected headloss development and had no effect on other studied parameters ackowledgements the authors would like to acknowledge the natural sciences and engineering research council of canada for

these contrasting designs is provided 2 field sites one of the study sites is located in maryhill a hamlet in the regional municipality of waterloo within the southern part of the province of ontario canada the local geology is characterized by glacial deposits quaternary resting on clastic and marine carbonate bedrock formations palaeozoic according to brown et al 18 southern ontario has a temperate climate with warm summers mild winters and reliable precipitation the mean annual precipitation varies from 800 to 1000 mm with mean monthly temperature ranging from 0 to 11 c in winter and from 11 to 26 c in summer 19 the other site is located in the jardim santo antonio settlement which belongs to the district of parelheiros in the southern part of the municipality of são paulo brazil near the billings and guarapiranga reservoir systems which are responsible for providing water to the cities of são paulo metropolitan region the local geology is characterized by crystalline metamorphic rocks from the açungui group neoproterozoic in particular the embu complex which consists of schists and gneisses and occasional migmatites and ectinites 20 the municipality of sao paulo presents a humid subtropical climate with hot and rainy summers and dry mild to cool winters the mean annual precipitation varies from 1 300 to 1 500 mm and the mean monthly temperature ranges from 12 to 23 c in winter and from 18 to 29 c in summer 21 3 wastewater evolution in an on site sanitation system domestic wastewater typically contains 20 to 85 mg l of total n mostly as a mixture of ammonium and organic nitrogen 6 in a septic system the solids are separated from the liquids by decantation in the tank where anaerobic digestion preponderates ammonification fermentation sulfate reduction and methanogenesis are examples of reactions that occur at this level the liquids then migrate through pipes to reach the tile bed where the infiltration into aerobic unsaturated sediments occurs at this point organic carbon and organic nitrogen or ammonium originating from the septic tank can undergo oxidation eqs 1 and 2 by autotrophic aerobic bacteria 1 c h 2 o o 2 c o 2 h 2 o 2 n h 4 2 o 2 n o 3 4 h h 2 o the wastewater depleted in organic carbon and enriched in nitrate may then reach the groundwater table the acidity generated by the nitrification reaction eq 2 can be buffered in carbonate rich groundwater or by the alkalinity present in wastewater itself nitrate tends to be mobile and persistent in aquifers that are aerobic however under anaerobic conditions nitrate can be attenuated by degradation reactions particularly denitrification 3 1 denitrification layer denitrification corresponds to a redox reaction mediated mainly by heterotrophic anaerobic bacteria the medium has to maintain a low concentration of oxygen so that nitrate can be used as the electron acceptor and reduced to n2 just as simultaneously there must be an electron donor to be oxidized 22 24 eq 3 3 4 n o 3 5 c h 2 o 4 h 2 n 2 5 c o 2 7 h 2 o saturated media such as aquifers offer conditions with low oxygen but may not provide adequate electron donors organic carbon provided by septic systems or soils is usually oxidized before reaching the water table 6 25 many studies have tested artificial porous media mixtures with a variety of added carbonaceous material to stimulate denitrification these include methanol ethanol propanol butanol pentanol glycol glycerol formic acid lactic acid acetic acid acetate glucose sucrose 26 32 soybeans corn maize cobs alfafa wheat straw green waste seaweed peat 15 33 36 newspaper cardboard 17 37 38 cotton 39 40 and woodchip or sawdust 14 17 37 41 48 the reported removal efficiency is highly variable and depends on the conditions provided for denitrifiers such as nitrate and carbon input type of carbon substrate c n ratio oxygen content media ph and temperature and the presence of inhibitors of denitrification such as high salinity or toxic compounds 22 43 49 and also on the hydraulic characteristics of the denitrification system especially permeability 43 wood products are substrates commonly used in wastewater treatment because of their global distribution low cost high c n ratio and longevity 34 several studies have shown that denitrification rates are strongly affected by temperature becoming higher as temperature increases 33 43 44 47 50 robertson et al 50 reported nitrate removal rates of 3 5 6 0 g n m3 d at 20 22 c and 0 22 1 1 g n m3 d at 6 10 c for the last year of a 15 year old septic treatment system located at long point site on canada if a significant difference in removal rate is observed at the same site in different seasons one would expect an amplified effect between systems under distinct climate conditions such as those referred to in this study the downflow latrine situated in a tropical region and the lateral flow latrine in a temperate one 3 2 bof slag layer bof slag is a reactive material generated by the steel making industry constituted primarily of portlandite ca oh 2 di and tri calcium silicate ferrous oxide and ca mg and mn ferrite 51 52 effluent in contact with portlandite rapidly reaches elevated ph 11 12 because of calcium hydroxide hydrolysis column and field studies show that bof slag is an effective material to attenuate po4 due to coprecipitation and adsorption 53 55 as well as coliform bacteria and prd 1 bacteriophage 56 58 by microbial inactivation at high ph and by microbial attachment to iron phases its high content of ferric oxyhydroxide surfaces represents preferred attachment sites for biocolloids 59 4 materials and methods 4 1 systems description at the maryhill site lateral flow latrine the treatment system employs a conventional septic tank to capture household wastewater fig 1 a the effluent is pumped out from the surface of the tank and it percolates by gravity through the first treatment cell nitrexplus cell which comprises two concrete tanks 1 88 width 4 57 length 0 82 m height each in which the top half corresponds to unsaturated sand filters up filter cl1 0 3 m mid filter cl1 0 5 m and low filter cl1 0 65 m and the basal half to saturated reactive media consisting of sawdust cl1 and cl2 after passing through the two tanks of the nitrexplus cell the wastewater flows through pipes cl3 and cl4 until it enters the second treatment cell phosphex cell where a baffle deflects it into two concrete tanks 2 05 width 2 90 length 1 52 m height for the entire tank filled with undersaturated bof slag cl5s cl5d and cl6 after the second cell the wastewater enters a tile bed cl8 cl9 and cl10 from which it percolates into the permeable natural sediments sand and gravel a flow meter installed just before the septic tank registered an average flow of 0 64 m3 day during the test period at the parelheiros site downflow latrine the wastewater treatment consists of a latrine 4 7 m height 2 0 m diameter filled by the following sequence of materials from top to bottom a cement ring for effluent reception fine to medium gravel layers the first reactive layer consisting of a mixture of bof slag and fine gravel a medium to coarse sand layer and the second reactive layer containing a mixture of sawdust and very coarse sand inside a cement ring which is sealed at the bottom with an impermeable membrane made of 2 mm pvc geotextile fig 1b a drainage pipe placed in the bottom of the sawdust layer permits overflow when the layer is fully saturated and drains into a fine gravel filter below an annular ring of medium gravel encapsulates the treatment system from the top of the sawdust layer to the ground surface to promote oxygenation into the system and consequently nitrification before the sawdust layer the wastewater percolates through this vertical structure by gravity and after passing through both reactive layers the treated effluent can infiltrate into the soil a flow meter installed in the wastewater discharge pipe of the toilet recorded an average flow of 0 11 m3 day during the test period the design of the downflow latrine is adapted to mimic the geometry of a common cesspit used by the inhabitants of parelheiros in which domestic effluent is directly disposed of in an underground cylindrical excavation 4 2 sampling and analytical procedure the maryhill system was monitored during one year from november 2001 to november 2002 from then until october 2008 another three sampling campaigns were carried out to keep track of the system efficiency this paper addresses samplings

exclusive sampling for e coli taken in september 2007 the unsaturated layers of the downflow latrine were sampled using pan lysimeters inverted polyethylene traffic cones attached to a 6 mm diameter

october 2008 before october 2002 ammonium was not completely nitrified 75 85 which can be explained by an inadequate sand filter volume top of cl1 and cl2 fig 2a nevertheless denitrification occurred in the sawdust layer bottom of cl1 and cl2 where no3 n was reduced from 60 to 0 2 mg l fig 2b in october 2002 the ammonium concentration was about 56 mg l fig 2a the sand filter placed on the top half of cl1 and containing the sampling points cl1 0 3 m cl1 0 5 m and cl1 0 65 m was effective at converting 98 of ammonium to up to 70 mg l of nitrate fig 2b then the sawdust layer denitrified 99 of the nitrate reducing the concentrations to non detectable levels 0 05 mg l fig 2b doc was detected in moderately high concentration in the cl tank 55 mg l but was also elevated in the sawdust layer cl1 70 mg l table 1 doc concentrations decreased in sampling points after the sawdust layer probably because of its consumption by the denitrification reaction parameters such as eh ec and cl help to better understand what happens in this treatment system redox conditions were reducing in the cl tank 300 mv and the saturated sawdust and bof layers 511 to 254 mv and oxidizing in the nitrifying filters above cl1 67 mv and the tile bed 70 to 47 mv table 1 ec was high in septic systems due to the high load of salts in wastewater table 1 ec remained around 2 500 μs cm throughout the system except for the area covered by the bof layer whose composition raised ec to values as high as 9 760 μs cm because of electrolytes input from calcium hydroxide hydrolysis cl concentrations fluctuated between 200 and 480 mg l table 1 cl contributes to ec and being a conservative anion it is possible to compare it with other effluent constituents like nitrate the no3 n cl ratio tended to be about 0 2 at the filters where the nitrification was most efficient and decreased to values as low as 10 4 after the effluent had reached the end of the treatment system which indicates the occurrence of denitrification samplings carried out after october 2002 showed that the sawdust layer retained the same efficiency in promoting denitrification fig 2b po4 p concentrations of 4 8 mg l were present before reaching the bof layer and then they fell to 0 3 mg l fig 2c ph values were also affected by the presence of bof as they started between 6 5 and 8 typical of wastewater and increased to values of 12 13 after the effluent had encountered the bof layer fig 2d in october 2002 phosphate was undetectable after the bof layer fig 2c the ph presented values between 6 5 and 8 0 before the effluent crossed the bof layer from this layer the ph increased to values of up to 14 between the sampling points cl5d and cl7 due to calcium hydroxide hydrolysis and decreased to close to 8 between cl8 and cl10 because of the contact of the effluent with oxygen in the tile bed fig 2d the porewater temperature ranged between 4 c january 2002 and 23 c october 2002 fig 2e in october 2002 initial e coli concentrations entering the treatment system cl tank and cl1 were greater than 20 000 cfu 100 ml the concentration was reduced to 1400 cfu 100 ml at cl5s the top of the bof layer and decreased to less than 10 cfu 100 ml after the bof layer fig 2f two more sampling events performed in november 2002 and october 2008 corroborated the same configuration presented by the snapshot october 2002 demonstrating the efficiency of the bof in microorganism removal fig 2f the slight increase in e coli at the tile bed 100 cfu 100 ml in october and november 2002 is explained by wastewater ph buffering from 13 to 7 7 caused by background porewater adjacent to the effluent input cl8 which locally compromised the complete inactivation of microorganisms 5 2 parelheiros downflow latrine figs 3 and 4 present the evolution profiles of ph temperature eh ec po4 p cl doc nh4 n no3 n and e coli between august 2007 and september 2008 time series results were interpreted based on the geometric mean of the data collected from the e c and w instruments since the parameters measured had a lognormal distribution just below the septic tank at the level of the first instruments p 5 the ph was around 7 over all sampling events fig 3a when the wastewater reached the bof layer p 3 ph increased to values as high as 13 which caused a disturbance in the following layers p 2 to p 1 during the first two campaigns august and november 2007 the further samplings again showed ph values of around 7 which can be explained by oxidation of organic matter co2 and consequently a decrease of ph the monthly average temperature of porewater ranged between 15 c august 2007 and 25 c september 2008 fig 3b eh was characterized by a large range of values 55 to 430 mv indicating oscillation of the wastewater composition and its evolution along the latrine fig 3c generally eh values were lower at the septic tank bof and sawdust layers 55 to 285 mv when compared with values for the sand layer p 2 above the sawdust layer 165 to 390 mv which is the most oxidizing layer since its function is to promote nitrification reducing conditions were present in the sawdust layer 55 to 285 mv which supports denitrification ec was high near the septic tank between 1 500 and 2 800 μs cm and remained around these values in layers above and below the bof layer fig 3d in the bof layer itself ec was much higher 4 000 8 800 μs cm due to the dissolution of calcium and magnesium oxyhydroxide minerals cl concentrations varied between 50 and 160 mg l along the latrine with no specific pattern fig 3e po4 p concentrations decreased from up to 23 mg l p 5 and p 4 levels to 0 01 mg l after crossing the bof layer fig 3f doc concentrations were high near the septic tank 16 83 mg l because of the organic matter present in wastewater fig 4a doc was gradually consumed oxidized along the latrine reaching 7 13 mg l at p 2 level a decline in mass corresponding to 43 88 in the sawdust layer doc concentrations started increasing because of the release of labile c 12 39 mg l nevertheless doc in the sawdust layer declined over time dropping from 39 mg l in august 2007 to 14 mg l in september 2008 the two main n species are shown in figs 4b and 4c the highest concentrations of nh4 n 20 90 mg l were situated just below the septic tank p 5 and then dropped to 0 06 mg l in the bof layer fig 4b indicating almost complete oxidation to no3 n which increased as expected in the oxidizing sand layer 40 195 mg l fig 4c no3 n concentrations then decreased in the sawdust layer to lower values 20 85 mg l the slight increase in nitrate in p 1 level is probably due to ammonium oxidation after some of this anion migrated unaffected through preferred pathways in nitrification zone between p 4 and p 2 levels and desorbed from the sawdust layer considering the maximum concentrations of no3 n obtained after nitrification and the lower concentrations of nitrate at p 1 level just below the sawdust layer the nitrate removal efficiency was about 13 in november 2007 and remained 47 57 for the other sampling campaigns the no3 n cl ratio was 1 in the nitrification zone p 4 to p 2 levels but then decreased to 0 3 0 6 in the sawdust layer this decreasing ratio provides evidence that nitrate is being removed from the system by an attenuation reaction i e denitrification e coli concentrations were over 500 000 cfu 100 ml underneath the septic tank and remained high until the top of the bof layer p 4 fig 4d below p 4 level concentrations were less than 1 cfu 100 ml except for one higher occurrence 80 000 cfu 100 ml at p 2 at the bottom of the bof layer which may be explained by preferential flow paths present within the bof layer 6 final remarks although the periods of evaluation of the maryhill and parelheiros systems were not coincident each was monitored for a full year enabling a hydrogeochemical comparison based primarily on design features the maryhill alternative latrine was able to oxidize 75 98 of ammonium to nitrate and then to subsequently to remove 99 of nitrate phosphate and e coli a larger volume of unsaturated sand above the sawdust layer could potentially improve the nitrification for this latrine design the parelheiros alternative latrine was very efficient in promoting nitrification largely because of the oxidizing sand layer before the saturated sawdust layer although the removal of nitrate was only up to 57 phosphate and e coli were largely removed from the system considering the highest values of nitrate input and removal efficiency obtained for each system the maryhill lateral flow latrine was able to take out 16 4 kg of no3 n per year and the parelheiros downflow latrine 4 4 kg of no3 n per year the maryhill and parelheiros treatment systems mainly differ in the relative position of the bof and sawdust layers in the maryhill system the sawdust layer comes before the bof and in the parelheiros system the opposite occurs this structure s bof first sawdust after design may have partially affected the performance of denitrifying bacteria because the high ph in the bof layer may have decreased microbiological activity a thicker sand package with some carbon carbonic acid could provide a better buffering of ph to more optimal levels 7 supporting the denitrifying bacteria thus the latrine design installed at the maryhill residence proved to be the more satisfactory in nitrate removal despite these design differences these treatment systems employing sawdust and bof in series and developed in countries under different climatic regimes proved to be efficient in the removal of nutrients and pathogens the most common contaminants related to on site wastewater disposal since the parelheiros latrine had a significantly lower nitrate removal efficiency than the maryhill latrine it was irrelevant to compare data according to discrepancies in temperature finally monitoring of the maryhill system six years after its implementation demonstrates that this type of passive treatment technology maintains its efficiency over time promoting the attenuation of nutrients and pathogens and preventing groundwater

ammonium and organic nitrogen 6 in a septic system the solids are separated from the liquids by decantation in the tank where anaerobic digestion preponderates ammonification fermentation sulfate reduction and methanogenesis are examples of reactions that occur at this level the liquids then migrate through pipes to reach the tile bed where the infiltration into aerobic unsaturated sediments occurs at this point organic carbon and organic nitrogen or ammonium originating from the septic tank can undergo oxidation eqs 1 and 2 by autotrophic aerobic bacteria 1 c h 2 o o 2 c o 2 h 2 o 2 n h 4 2 o 2 n o 3 4 h h 2 o the wastewater depleted in organic carbon and enriched in nitrate may then reach the groundwater table the acidity generated by the nitrification reaction eq 2 can be buffered in carbonate rich groundwater or by the alkalinity present in wastewater itself nitrate tends to be mobile and persistent in aquifers that are aerobic however under anaerobic conditions nitrate can be attenuated by degradation reactions particularly denitrification 3 1 denitrification layer denitrification corresponds to a redox reaction mediated mainly by heterotrophic anaerobic bacteria the medium has to maintain a low concentration of oxygen so that nitrate can be used as the electron acceptor and reduced to n2 just as simultaneously there must be an electron donor to be oxidized 22 24 eq 3 3 4 n o 3 5 c h 2 o 4 h 2 n 2 5 c o 2 7 h 2 o saturated media such as aquifers offer conditions with low oxygen but may not provide adequate electron donors organic carbon provided by septic systems or soils is usually oxidized before reaching the water table 6 25 many studies have tested artificial porous media mixtures with a variety of added carbonaceous material to stimulate denitrification these include methanol ethanol propanol butanol pentanol glycol glycerol formic acid lactic acid acetic acid acetate glucose sucrose 26 32 soybeans corn maize cobs alfafa wheat straw green waste seaweed peat 15 33 36 newspaper cardboard 17 37 38 cotton 39 40 and woodchip or sawdust 14 17 37 41 48 the reported removal efficiency is highly variable and depends on the conditions provided for denitrifiers such as nitrate and carbon input type of carbon substrate c n ratio oxygen content media ph and temperature and the presence of inhibitors of denitrification such as high salinity or toxic compounds 22 43 49 and also on the hydraulic characteristics of the denitrification system especially permeability 43 wood products are substrates commonly used in wastewater treatment because of their global distribution low cost high c n ratio and longevity 34 several studies have shown that denitrification rates are strongly affected by temperature becoming higher as temperature increases 33 43 44 47 50 robertson et al 50 reported nitrate removal rates of 3 5 6 0 g n m3 d at 20 22 c and 0 22 1 1 g n m3 d at 6 10 c for the last year of a 15 year old septic treatment system located at long point site on canada if a significant difference in removal rate is observed at the same site in different seasons one would expect an amplified effect between systems under distinct climate conditions such as those referred to in this study the downflow latrine situated in a tropical region and the lateral flow latrine in a temperate one 3 2 bof slag layer bof slag is a reactive material generated by the steel making industry constituted primarily of portlandite ca oh 2 di and tri calcium silicate ferrous oxide and ca mg and mn ferrite 51 52 effluent in contact with portlandite rapidly reaches elevated ph 11 12 because of calcium hydroxide hydrolysis column and field studies show that bof slag is an effective material to attenuate po4 due to coprecipitation and adsorption 53 55 as well as coliform bacteria and prd 1 bacteriophage 56 58 by microbial inactivation at high ph and by microbial attachment to iron phases its high content of ferric oxyhydroxide surfaces represents preferred attachment sites for biocolloids 59 4 materials and methods 4 1 systems description at the maryhill site lateral flow latrine the treatment system employs a conventional septic tank to capture household wastewater fig 1 a the effluent is pumped out from the surface of the tank and it percolates by gravity through the first treatment cell nitrexplus cell which comprises two concrete tanks 1 88 width 4 57 length 0 82 m height each in which the top half corresponds to unsaturated sand filters up filter cl1 0 3 m mid filter cl1 0 5 m and low filter cl1 0 65 m and the basal half to saturated reactive media consisting of sawdust cl1 and cl2 after passing through the two tanks of the nitrexplus cell the wastewater flows through pipes cl3 and cl4 until it enters the second treatment cell phosphex cell where a baffle deflects it into two concrete tanks 2 05 width 2 90 length 1 52 m height for the entire tank filled with undersaturated bof slag cl5s cl5d and cl6 after the second cell the wastewater enters a tile bed cl8 cl9 and cl10 from which it percolates into the permeable natural sediments sand and gravel a flow meter installed just before the septic tank registered an average flow of 0 64 m3 day during the test period at the parelheiros site downflow latrine the wastewater treatment consists of a latrine 4 7 m height 2 0 m diameter filled by the following sequence of materials from top to bottom a cement ring for effluent reception fine to medium gravel layers the first reactive layer consisting of a mixture of bof slag and fine gravel a medium to coarse sand layer and the second reactive layer containing a mixture of sawdust and very coarse sand inside a cement ring which is sealed at the bottom with an impermeable membrane made of 2 mm pvc geotextile fig 1b a drainage pipe placed in the bottom of the sawdust layer permits overflow when the layer is fully saturated and drains into a fine gravel filter below an annular ring of medium gravel encapsulates the treatment system from the top of the sawdust layer to the ground surface to promote oxygenation into the system and consequently nitrification before the sawdust layer the wastewater percolates through this vertical structure by gravity and after passing through both reactive layers the treated effluent can infiltrate into the soil a flow meter installed in the wastewater discharge pipe of the toilet recorded an average flow of 0 11 m3 day during the test period the design of the downflow latrine is adapted to mimic the geometry of a common cesspit used by the inhabitants of parelheiros in which domestic effluent is directly disposed of in an underground cylindrical excavation 4 2 sampling and analytical procedure the maryhill system was monitored during one year from november 2001 to november 2002 from then until october 2008 another three sampling campaigns were carried out to keep track of the system efficiency this paper addresses samplings

total of seven sampling campaigns were carried out at parelheiros site during one year between august 2007 and september 2008 but this paper focuses on four representative snapshots besides an exclusive sampling for e coli taken in september 2007 the unsaturated layers of the downflow latrine were sampled using pan lysimeters inverted polyethylene traffic cones attached to a 6 mm diameter pvc sampling tube these pan lysimeters were filled with material of a finer grain size than the media and placed in a row in three equally spaced horizontal positions east e centre c and west w along the unsaturated layers of the latrine fig 1b samples from the saturated zone were obtained by multilevel piezometers pvc tubing placed along the sawdust layer in the same horizontal positions as the

nh4 n no3 n po4 p and e coli during seven representative sampling events from november 2001 to october 2008 table 1 reports eh ec doc and cl concentrations measured in october 2002 snapshot and october 2008 before october 2002 ammonium was not completely nitrified 75 85 which can be explained by an inadequate sand filter volume top of cl1 and cl2 fig 2a nevertheless denitrification occurred in the sawdust layer bottom of cl1 and cl2 where no3 n was reduced from 60 to 0 2 mg l fig 2b in october 2002 the ammonium concentration was about 56 mg l fig 2a the sand filter placed on the top half of cl1 and containing the sampling points cl1 0 3 m cl1 0 5 m and cl1 0 65 m was effective at converting 98 of ammonium to up to 70 mg l of nitrate fig 2b then the sawdust layer denitrified 99 of the nitrate reducing the concentrations to non detectable levels 0 05 mg l fig 2b doc was detected in moderately high concentration in the cl tank 55 mg l but was also elevated in the sawdust layer cl1 70 mg l table 1 doc concentrations decreased in sampling points after the sawdust layer probably because of its consumption by the denitrification reaction parameters such as eh ec and cl help to better understand what happens in this treatment system redox conditions were reducing in the cl tank 300 mv and the saturated sawdust and bof layers 511 to 254 mv and oxidizing in the nitrifying filters above cl1 67 mv and the tile bed 70 to 47 mv table 1 ec was high in septic systems due to the high load of salts in wastewater table 1 ec remained around 2 500 μs cm throughout the system except for the area covered by the bof layer whose composition raised ec to values as high as 9 760 μs cm because of electrolytes input from calcium hydroxide hydrolysis cl concentrations fluctuated between 200 and 480 mg l table 1 cl contributes to ec and being a conservative anion it is possible to compare it with other effluent constituents like nitrate the no3 n cl ratio tended to be about 0 2 at the filters where the nitrification was most efficient and decreased to values as low as 10 4 after the effluent had reached the end of the treatment system which indicates the occurrence of denitrification samplings carried out after october 2002 showed that the sawdust layer retained the same efficiency in promoting denitrification fig 2b po4 p concentrations of 4 8 mg l were present before reaching the bof layer and then they fell to 0 3 mg l fig 2c ph values were also affected by the presence of bof as they started between 6 5 and 8 typical of wastewater and increased to values of 12 13 after the effluent had encountered the bof layer fig 2d in october 2002 phosphate was undetectable after the bof layer fig 2c the ph presented values between 6 5 and 8 0 before the effluent crossed the bof layer from this layer the ph increased to values of up to 14 between the sampling points cl5d and cl7 due to calcium hydroxide hydrolysis and decreased to close to 8 between cl8 and cl10 because of the contact of the effluent with oxygen in the tile bed fig 2d the porewater temperature ranged between 4 c january 2002 and 23 c october 2002 fig 2e in october 2002 initial e coli concentrations entering the treatment system cl tank and cl1 were greater than 20 000 cfu 100 ml the concentration was reduced to 1400 cfu 100 ml at cl5s the top of the bof layer and decreased to less than 10 cfu 100 ml after the bof layer fig 2f two more sampling events performed in november 2002 and october 2008 corroborated the same configuration presented by the snapshot october 2002 demonstrating the efficiency of the bof in microorganism removal fig 2f the slight increase in e coli at the tile bed 100 cfu 100 ml in october and november 2002 is explained by wastewater ph buffering from 13 to 7 7 caused by background porewater adjacent to the effluent input cl8 which locally compromised the complete inactivation of microorganisms 5 2 parelheiros downflow latrine figs 3 and 4 present the evolution profiles of ph temperature eh ec po4 p cl doc nh4 n no3 n and e coli between august 2007 and september 2008 time series results were interpreted based on the geometric mean of the data collected from the e c and w instruments since the parameters measured had a lognormal distribution just below the septic tank at the level of the first instruments p 5 the ph was around 7 over all sampling events fig 3a when the wastewater reached the bof layer p 3 ph increased to values as high as 13 which caused a disturbance in the following layers p 2 to p 1 during the first two campaigns august and november 2007 the further samplings again showed ph values of around 7 which can be explained by oxidation of organic matter co2 and consequently a decrease of ph the monthly average temperature of porewater ranged between 15 c august 2007 and 25 c september 2008 fig 3b eh was characterized by a large range of values 55 to 430 mv indicating oscillation of the wastewater composition and its evolution along the latrine fig 3c generally eh values were lower at the septic tank bof and sawdust layers 55 to 285 mv when compared with values for the sand layer p 2 above the sawdust layer 165 to 390 mv which is the most oxidizing layer since its function is to promote nitrification reducing conditions were present in the sawdust layer 55 to 285 mv which supports denitrification ec was high near the septic tank between 1 500 and 2 800 μs cm and remained around these values in layers above and below the bof layer fig 3d in the bof layer itself ec was much higher 4 000 8 800 μs cm due to the dissolution of calcium and magnesium oxyhydroxide minerals cl concentrations varied between 50 and 160 mg l along the latrine with no specific pattern fig 3e po4 p concentrations decreased from up to 23 mg l p 5 and p 4 levels to 0 01 mg l after crossing the bof layer fig 3f doc concentrations were high near the septic tank 16 83 mg l because of the organic matter present in wastewater fig 4a doc was gradually consumed oxidized along the latrine reaching 7 13 mg l at p 2 level a decline in mass corresponding to 43 88 in the sawdust layer doc concentrations started increasing because of the release of labile c 12 39 mg l nevertheless doc in the sawdust layer declined over time dropping from 39 mg l in august 2007 to 14 mg l in september 2008 the two main n species are shown in figs 4b and 4c the highest concentrations of nh4 n 20 90 mg l were situated just below the septic tank p 5 and then dropped to 0 06 mg l in the bof layer fig 4b indicating almost complete oxidation to no3 n which increased as expected in the oxidizing sand layer 40 195 mg l fig 4c no3 n concentrations then decreased in the sawdust layer to lower values 20 85 mg l the slight increase in nitrate in p 1 level is probably due to ammonium oxidation after some of this anion migrated unaffected through preferred pathways in nitrification zone between p 4 and p 2 levels and desorbed from the sawdust layer considering the maximum concentrations of no3 n obtained after nitrification and the lower concentrations of nitrate at p 1 level just below the sawdust layer the nitrate removal efficiency was about 13 in november 2007 and remained 47 57 for the other sampling campaigns the no3 n cl ratio was 1 in the nitrification zone p 4 to p 2 levels but then decreased to 0 3 0 6 in the sawdust layer this decreasing ratio provides evidence that nitrate is being removed from the system by an attenuation reaction i e denitrification e coli concentrations were over 500 000 cfu 100 ml underneath the septic tank and remained high until the top of the bof layer p 4 fig 4d below p 4 level concentrations were less than 1 cfu 100 ml except for one higher occurrence 80 000 cfu 100 ml at p 2 at the bottom of the bof layer which may be explained by preferential flow paths present within the bof layer 6 final remarks although the periods of evaluation of the maryhill and parelheiros systems were not coincident each was monitored for a full year enabling a hydrogeochemical comparison based primarily on design features the maryhill alternative latrine was able to oxidize 75 98 of ammonium to nitrate and then to subsequently to remove 99 of nitrate phosphate and e coli a larger volume of unsaturated sand above the sawdust layer could potentially improve the nitrification for this latrine design the parelheiros alternative latrine was very efficient in promoting nitrification largely because of the oxidizing sand layer before the saturated sawdust layer although the removal of nitrate was only up to 57 phosphate and e coli were largely removed from the system considering the highest values of nitrate input and removal efficiency obtained for each system the maryhill lateral flow latrine was able to take out 16 4 kg of no3 n per year and the parelheiros downflow latrine 4 4 kg of no3 n per year the maryhill and parelheiros treatment systems mainly differ in the relative position of the bof and sawdust layers in the maryhill system the sawdust layer comes before the bof and in the parelheiros system the opposite occurs this structure s bof first sawdust after design may have partially affected the performance of denitrifying bacteria because the high ph in the bof layer may have decreased microbiological activity a thicker sand package with some carbon carbonic acid could provide a better buffering of ph to more optimal levels 7 supporting the denitrifying bacteria thus the latrine design installed at the maryhill residence proved to be the more satisfactory in nitrate removal despite these design differences these treatment systems employing sawdust and bof in series and developed in countries under different climatic regimes proved to be efficient in the removal of nutrients and pathogens the most common contaminants related to on site wastewater disposal since the parelheiros latrine had a significantly lower nitrate removal efficiency than the maryhill latrine it was irrelevant to compare data according to discrepancies in temperature finally monitoring of the maryhill system six years after its implementation demonstrates that this type of passive treatment technology maintains its efficiency over time promoting the attenuation of nutrients and pathogens and preventing groundwater

14223,a predictive nanofiltration model was built in python to be used in reverse osmosis brine treatment processes the model was fitted to rejection data obtained from nf trains functioning as a brine concentrator upstream of a gypsum precipitation reactor at a full scale mine water treatment plant in ahafo ghana over the six month operational period considered september 2017 march 2018 the rejection capability of the installed elements deteriorated considerably this was reflected by a 13 increase in membrane pore radius 40 decrease in effective active layer thickness and an 18 decrease in absolute value of the feed membrane donnan potential performance of elements from other manufacturers was simulated by loading their respective properties into the model cases modelled included a tightly wound dow nf 90 a loosely wound desal ds 5 dl and a koch tfc sr 2 element rejections obtained from the installed mds elements most closely approximated the performance of a loose nf element these modelling studies have shown that the nf model built is capable of modelling nanofiltration in brackish water treatment processes the current disadvantage of the model is the number of membrane

1 introduction reverse osmosis ro is one of few technologies used for the treatment of mine impacted water exposure of water and oxygen to pyrite inside mine voids generates sulphate and acidity which enables the dissolution of carbonate and silicate based minerals with subsequent liberation of metals including ba2 ca2 and sr2 1 the volumetric recovery achievable in an ro plant is thus very much limited by the sulphate based mineral saturation indices gypsum caso4 2h2o celestite srso4 and barite baso4 in the feed typical ro volumetric recoveries in mine water desalination plants are in the range 70 80 with the remaining brine stream having a high sulphate scaling potential the brine is typically sent to the tailings storage facility tsf and can be re used as makeup water in the mine s mineral recovery process treatment processes are designed for volume reduction sulphate removal and ionic strength reduction of the primary ro brine before being fed into the mine s water reticulation circuit membrane based brine treatment processes typically employ a nanofiltration nf step downstream of the primary ro unit which functions as a concentrator upstream of the gypsum precipitation reactor the nf also produces a permeate stream rich in monovalent species which depending on the no3 and nh4 content can be blended directly with the primary ro permeate to boost the overall volumetric recovery of the facility in specific cases where zero liquid discharge zld is targeted the nf may be incorporated into a recycle loop with intermediate chemical demineralization salts which contain monovalent cations such as nacl kcl and na2so4 are highly soluble in water hence precipitation reactors are not capable of removing monovalent cations in cases where zld is required the nf permeate stream serves as the purge of monovalent species inside the treatment loop its ability to allow passage of monovalent cations as well as its so4 2 rejection capability dictate if a brine bleed requires implementation and hence the possibility of achieving zld modelling of the nf and subsequent element selection thus forms an essential part of the design phase of such projects element suppliers are typically provided with a feed basis from the process consultant and a performance projection is provided based on the element and vessel configuration selected suppliers model the feed water as a combination of single salts nacl na2so4 caso4 etc for which they have salt permeability coefficients b values calibrated with single salt rejection data salt flux obeys a simplified form of the solution diffusion model with flux directly proportional to the chemical potential gradient across the membrane 2 there are multiple properties of nf membranes which enable them to reject dissolved ionic species including the presence of pores on the membrane surface which enable steric size exclusion the development of a fixed charge on the surface of the membrane which excludes ions of the same charge sign from entering the membrane commonly referred to as donnan partitioning or the gibbs donnan effect and confined spaces within the membrane pores restrict the movement of solvent water molecules this leads to a reduction in membrane pore dielectric constant compared to the feed bulk and hence an additional energy barrier for passage through the membrane is created commonly referred to as the born solvation energy barrier the said membrane properties are grouped together with the effect of operating conditions such as solution temperature and ph into a single regression parameter in the simplified solution diffusion model which is problematic for process designers particularly when more rigorous modelling of the system is required the intent of this paper is to present the development of an alternative nf model referred to in literature as the donnan steric pore partitioning and dielectric exclusion dspm de model for use in brine treatment processes the model includes solving the extended nernst planck enp equation for each species inside the active layer of the nf membrane with the mechanisms of diffusion convection and electro migration being considered boundary conditions used for solving the differential equations include partitioning at the feed membrane and membrane permeate interfaces with steric born solvation and donnan partitioning factors included the technique used for solving the equations was based on the paper by geraldes brites alves 3 this involved discretizing the membrane active layer into successive nodes and linearizing the system of equations to get the system to be described in the matrix form a x b with x being the solution vector comprising molar concentrations of each species at each node within the membrane the system of equations was then solved iteratively using lu decomposition theory and gauss elimination with the code being built in the programming language python species included in the system were na ca2 mg2 so4 2 no3 and hco3 all of which are considered to be the dominant ions found in mine impacted water sources feed solutions for the model were built using analytical data from six months of operation of a 4 3 ml day mine water treatment plant for a gold mine in ahafo ghana the initial set of analytical data from september 2017 was used to determine the installed nf elements physical properties this included pore size and active layer thickness a sensitivity analysis was performed to illustrate the effects of donnan partitioning and born solvation on the rejection capability of the membrane for a given set of hydraulic conditions and solution chemistry this enabled an appropriate donnan potential and membrane pore dielectric constant to be determined three additional sets of data are then provided to enable characterization of the element as the operational campaign developed finally elements from other manufacturers were loaded into the model characterized by their pore size and active layer thickness determined elsewhere by other researchers and the individual species rejection compared with the current installed elements 2 methods a conceptual diagram of the nf membrane to be modelled is presented in fig 1 the diagram describes two distinct regions in which mass transfer of solutes occurs 1 through the concentration polarization layer to the feed membrane interface and 2 through the active layer inside the membrane to the membrane permeate interface partitioning of solutes occurs at the feed membrane and membrane permeate interfaces which are dependent on steric donnan partitioning and born solvation effects the concentration polarization layer develops on the feed side due to exclusion of solutes at the feed membrane interface which then diffuse back down a concentration gradient into the bulk solution 2 1 solute mass transfer in boundary layer the net flux of a dissolved ionic species through the concentration polarization layer thus comprises a convective term to account for draw of solute with water in the direction of the hydraulic gradient a diffusive term to account for diffusion towards the feed bulk and an electro migration term which enables an electrical potential to develop to ensure charge balance is maintained at the feed membrane interface 4 computation of the flux is performed using eq 1 and electroneutrality within the boundary layer ensured using eq 2 1 j i j v c i m k c i c i m c i b z i c i m d i f r t ε where j i is the solute flux of species i j v is the water flux c i m is the membrane concentration of species i c i b is the bulk feed concentration of species i z i is the charge of species i d i is the diffusivity in water of species i f is the faraday constant r is the gas

species i at the first node inside the active layer of the membrane c i 1 is related to its molar concentration at the membrane surface c i m according to eq 4 eq 5 relates the molar concentration of

radii φ i is determined using eq 6 with the assumption that there exists well defined cylindrical pores within the membrane 6 confined spaces within the pores of the membrane results in a reduction in dielectric constant and hence solvation capacity of the fluid which presents a further barrier for ionic species to enter the active layer and is referred to as the born solvation energy barrier δ w i 7 the dielectric exclusion factor φ b is related to δ w i through eq 8 6 φ i 1 r s i r p 2 1 λ i 2 7 δ w i z i 2 e 0 2 8 π ε 0 r s i 1 ε p 1 ε b 8 φ b e x p δ w i k t where r s i is the stokes radius of solute i r p is the membrane pore radius e 0 is the electronic charge constant ε 0 is the vacuum permittivity constant ε p is the membrane pore dielectric constant ε b is the feed bulk solution dielectric constant and k is the boltzmann constant since the ionic species in solution possess different physical stokes radius and electrical charge properties their steric and born partitioning factors vary and hence have differing capabilities to pass into and out of the membrane at the feed membrane and permeate membrane interfaces respectively to maintain charge balance within each region a potential difference is developed at both membrane interfaces δ φ d m the donnan potential at the feed membrane interface and δ φ d p the donnan potential at the membrane permeate interface activity coefficients of each species inside the concentration polarization layer γ i m inside the permeate γ i p and inside the active layer of the membrane γ i 1 n are determined using the davies equation

hindrance factors are a function of the solute to pore radius and appropriate correlations for each are provided in appendix c 10 11 10 d i p k i d d i in addition to steric and dielectric exclusion phenomena the development of a surface charge density within the active layer of the membrane also plays a prominent role in species rejection mechanisms for surface charge development include 12 ph

neutral to alkaline conditions the functional group dissociates into the coo ion which contributes to a negative charge density counter ion adsorption onto charged hydrophilic sites this decreases the magnitude of charge developed due to acid base ionization mentioned above and competitive ion adsorption onto the hydrophobic alkyl or aromatic functional groups ch factors influencing adsorption include ion size and charge monovalent anions such as cl and no3 and divalent anions such as so4 2 are more easily adsorbed than their positively charged counterparts due to their smaller stokes radii this enhances the negative surface charge density of nf membranes and has found to be the case for many types of brackish water as well as for sea water the mechanism for ion exclusion due to development of surface charge is introduced in this model by imposing a charge offset at each node inside the active layer of the membrane equal in magnitude to the surface charge density c x as shown in eq 11 below donnan potentials at the feed membrane and membrane permeate interfaces δ φ d m and δ φ d p are thus iterated through to ensure the charge offset is met on the inside of the membrane 11 i 1 n z i c i c x 2 4 solute transfer into the permeate transport through the permeate spacers of the membrane is assumed to be carried out without any hindrance and solute flux is described using the relation provided in eq 12 electroneutrality on the permeate side is ensured by introducing eq 13 12 j i j v c i p 13 i 1 n z i c i p 0 where c i p is the permeate concentration of species i finally flux continuity through the element for each species is ensured by equating the flux equations describing transport within each region of the membrane 14 j i b o u n d a r y l a y e r j i a c t i v e

of the bicarbonate hco3 ion carbonic equilibrium is enforced at the feed membrane interface active layer and at the membrane permeate interface as shown in eq 15 below 15 k s p γ h c h γ h c o 3 c h c o 3 γ h 2 c o 3 c h 2 c o 3 where k s p is the solubility product constant for the dissociation reaction of carbonic acid into the bicarbonate ion and hydrogen ion 2 6 membrane hydraulics water flux through the nf element is related to the applied feed pressure via the use of eq 16 below the membrane a value is commonly referred to as the pure water permeability constant and is provided by

algorithm for nf model the enp differential equation for flux of each species eq 9 was discretized by dividing the membrane active layer depicted in fig 1 into successive grid nodes with equal spacing δ x j a forward differences scheme was used to approximate the solute concentration and electrical potential gradients within the active layer as shown in eq 17 17 j i d i p c i j l c i j δ x j 1 2 k

linearized according to the method developed by geraldes brites alves 3 the method involves rewritng the equations as linear combinations of c i m c i j c i j 1 and c i p as well as ε φ j φ j 1 and φ p the coefficients of the linear combinations comprise system properties such as φ i φ b and d i p as well as the values obtained from the previous iteration for the variables listed above denoted as c i m c i j c i j 1 c i p ε φ j φ j 1 and φ p geraldes brites alves 3 wrote their programming code in fortran the authors of this paper however preferred to develop the code in python due to the availability of built in functions for handling of matrices and arrays which allowed for a shorter and more efficient script refer to fig 2 for a logic diagram of the code used in this study the code includes building the coefficient matrix a matrix and solution vector b vector which then solves for the solution vector x vector using lu decomposition and gauss elimination the coeffcient matrix is then updated and solved again the process is repeated until the convergence criteria are met provided in eq 18 below 18 m a x c i j c i j c i j t o l in addition to discretization of the membrane active layer the membrane was also discretized along the feed channel as well feed channel velocity decreases along the element string due to flux of water through to the permeate this reduces each ionic species mass transfer coefficient see appendix a and hence provides for a larger concentration polarization factor when compared to the lead section of the element see eq 1 discretizing the membrane along the feed channel thus allows for more accurate estimation of species concentration at the membrane surface and hence a more accurate overall prediction of rejection species bulk concentration at each successive node within the feed channel was then determined using a mass balance as shown in eq 19 the membrane hydraulics equation eq 16 was then also applied to each node along the element string with the overall permeate flux related to individual node permeate fluxes through the use of eq 20 19 c b i k 1 c b i k 1 j v k s a k q f e e d k j v k s a k q f e e d k c p i k 1 j

2 8 nf model simulation specifications table 1 below provides key design parameters of the installed nf trains at the brine treatment plant in ahafo ghana for all subsequent modelling presented in this paper the array design was kept the same as the installed trains operational data processed by sgs laboratories in tema ghana during the first six months of operation are provided in appendix d data from the initial stages of operation table d1 were used as modelling inputs for determination of the initial pore size and effective active layer thickness of the installed elements the same feed basis was also used to model the performance of membranes from other manufacturers to compare with the installed mds membranes data provided in tables d2 d3 and d4 were used to determine how the installed elements pore size effective active layer thickness and membrane charge density varied as the operational campaign developed appendix e provides physical properties of the ions used in the simulation table 2 lists additional simulation parameters which were kept constant throughout the modelling work 3 results and discussion the intent of fig 3 and fig 4 is to illustrate the effect of membrane charge density and membrane pore dielectric constant both of which are input parameters in the model on individual species rejection in a full scale nanofiltration system species rejection was computed at multiple permeate fluxes via manipulation of the overall train volumetric recovery target for each set of simulations permeate production rate is directly proportional to the applied net driving pressure across the membrane while the rate of dissolved species transport across the membrane is independent of net driving pressure increasing net driving pressure thus increases the difference in transport rate across the membrane between clean water and dissolved solutes providing the impression that dissolved solute rejection increases as permeate flux increases as is clear in both sets of figures the exception in this case is na whose rejection appears to decrease as permeate flux is increased this phenomenon is related to the relative composition of species in the feed solution being studied nanofiltration membranes generally provide relatively high rejection of multivalent ions in this case the dominant cation in solution on a molar basis is ca2 and the dominant anion on a molar basis is so4 2 the degree of separation is greatly enhanced for these species as the rate of water transport across the membrane is increased the behaviour is replicated for hco3 and no3 although to a lesser extent compared to so4 2 due to their smaller ion stokes radii hence there is still a relatively high hco3 and no3 content in the permeate stream to compensate for the lack of ca2 in the permeate stream to maintain charge balance with hco3 and no3 there is a higher flux of na across the membrane the effect of membrane charge density on rejection for the six ion system under study is presented in fig 3 enhancing the negative membrane charge density or feed membrane donnan potential δ φ d m improves so4 2 rejection due to electrostatic repulsion the rejection of ca2 and mg2 reduces with increasing negative charge density due to electrostatic attraction the rejection of monovalent anions no3 and hco3 are accordingly reduced to maintain charge balance with the increased passage of divalent cations the rejection of the monovalent cation na on the other hand is improved to maintain charge balance with the reduced passage of divalent anions the effect of varying the pore dielectric constant on species rejection for the six ion system under study is presented in fig 4 reducing ε p o r e enhances the born solvation energy barrier δ w i for all species at the feed membrane interface and hence the rejection of all species is subsequently improved oatley et al 13 conducted single salt rejection experiments using dow filmtec nf99hf and nf270 elements and fitted the data to the dspm de model to determine an appropriate ε p o r e which was determined to be in the range 37 8 42 2 argelaguet 14 followed the same procedure using desal ds 5 dk elements on sea water and found ε p o r e to be 35 for all further modelling work presented in this paper ε p o r e was set to 37 table 3 below presents estimates of membrane pore size effective active layer thickness and feed membrane donnan potential for the installed nf elements in ahafo ghana as the campaign developed over the first six months of operation a general trend of a decrease in all species rejection is observed with time supported by an increase in rpore and a decrease in δxe so4 2 rejection also deteriorates appreciably with time from 99 6 to 96 2 indicating a change in membrane surface chemistry and the element s inherent ability to adsorb anions to develop a negative charge density these results are supported by an 18 reduction in magnitude of the fitted δϕd m over six months of operation the nf trains in ahafo are subjected to a high fouling and scaling potential feed water and frequent chemical cleans are required to restore the element flux it is thought that the combination of foulant scale and frequent exposure to high and low ph cleans have caused irreversible damage to the membrane active layer and reduced its rejection capability these observations have been made before by other researchers 15 the initial performance of the installed mds elements rpore 0 46 nm δxe 0 25 μm is compared with the simulated performance of elements from other manufacturers in fig 5 below three other membranes were used in the comparison a dow filtec nf90 which is considered to be a relatively tight membrane with rpore 0 34 nm and δxe 1 46 μm 16 a desal ds 5 dl which is considered to be a relatively loose membrane with rpore 0 5 nm and δxe 0 37 μm 17 and a koch tfc sr 2 which is considered to be an intermediate between the two abovementioned membranes with rpore 0 46 nm and δxe 1 09 μm 16 all four membranes used in the simulation contain a polyamide active layer and thus the same value for δ φ d m was used in each case no significant difference in so4 2 rejection is observed for the membranes with a rejection ratio 99 for all cases at a typical volumetric recovery of 40 from this it can be deduced that the donnan exclusion and born solvation effects are dominant with respect to so4 2 rejection for all other species the physical properties of the membrane active layer play a significant role in rejection of consequence is the reduced ca2 rejection for the installed elements compared to the nf90 and tfc sr 2 elements this reduces the gypsum saturation ratio of the nf brine entering the gypsum precipitation reactor which needs to be compensated for by an increase in lime addition on the other hand the combined rejection of monovalent species is enhanced using nf 90 and tfc sr 2 elements with the nf90 in particular more closely resembling an ro membrane this enhances the ionic strength of the nf brine which suppresses the ca2 and so4 2 activity coefficients and hence the gypsum saturation ratio sr another consequence is the increased carbonic species loading entering the reactor the hco3 rejection at 40 recovery is projected to be 73 5 for the nf 90 as opposed to 12 6 for the installed mds elements which ultimately drives up the lime consumption rate the results were used to determine the projected nf brine stream entering the gypsum precipitation reactor for the different elements at 40 recovery phreeqc an open source geochemical modelling software developed by the us geological survey 18 was then used in conjunction with its minteq database for thermodynamic properties of the relevant aqueous species to determine the ionic strength and gypsum sr of each nf brine stream to determine the optimal element the results are presented in table 4 below the nf 90 and tfc sr 2 provide the highest gypsum sr 279 taking into account the increased hco3 loading into the reactor using the nf 90 elements and the fact that the nf 90 is a much tighter membrane with lower pure water permeability the tfc sr 2 in this case would be the optimal element for selection 4 conclusions sensitivity analyses showed donnan exclusion and born solvation effects played the most prominent role in determining the high so4 2 rejection 99 commonly observed using nf membranes for brackish water sources the model was fitted to data obtained from six months of operation of a full scale mine water treatment plant for a gold mine in ahafo ghana to determine how the membrane pore radius effective active layer thickness and membrane charge density varied as the operational campaign developed results showed that all three properties of the membrane deteriorated with time most likely due to a combination of fouling scaling and frequent exposure to high and low ph chemical cleans performance of elements from different manufacturers was then simulated and compared to the installed elements at the plant results showed that the elements most closely resemble a loosely wound nf membrane concern was expressed for the low ca2 rejection obtained with the elements bearing in mind that the nf functions as a concentrator upstream of a gypsum precipitation reactor the projected nf brine streams from each element were then run in phreeqc to determine the element which provided the highest gypsum sr the tightly wound nf 90 and intermediate tfc sr 2 elements provided the same gypsum sr suggesting that the high rejection of monovalent species using the tightly wound element increases the ionic strength of the brine sufficiently to impact the ca2 and so4 2 activity coefficients the tightly wound nf 90 provided a significantly higher hco3 rejection thus increasing the lime addition requirement into the reactor and also has a lower pure water permeability constant compared to the intermediate tfc sr 2 element which was thus considered to be the optimal element for this specific case it must be noted however that if the brine treatment process is modified and the nf placed into a recycle loop with zld targeted then this would not be the case a loosely wound element would be preferred as it would allow passage of monovalent species for which there is no geochemical control inside a precipitation reactor into the permeate stream and thus preventing the requirement for a brine bleed through this study it has been demonstrated that the model is powerful enough to simulate performance of a full scale nanofiltration system with multiple ionic species being considered the model contains enough membrane specific input parameters to describe the behaviour of these complex systems these parameters are 1 membrane pore radius 2 membrane active layer thickness 3 membrane charge density and 4 membrane pore dielectric constant parameters 1 and 2 largely account for the difference in transport behaviour between the larger multivalent ions such as ca2 and mg2 and the smaller univalent ions such as na and no3 parameters 1 and 2 alone cannot describe the high so4 2 rejection 99 and the slightly lower rejection for the multivalent cations 85 95 which is observed in nanofiltration systems across a variety of feed water types parameter 3 i e the effect of donnan partitioning greatly enhances the rejection of so4 2 due to electrostatic repulsion whilst also reducing the rejections of ca2 and mg2 due to electrostatic attraction parameter 4 i e born solvation effects enhance the rejection of all species but has the greatest effect on so4 2 due to its ionic charge and small stokes radius when compared to the multivalent cations the challenge with this model is the ability to verify these input parameters with independent laboratory experiments attempts have been made to verify parameters 1 and 2 using multiple methods these range from indirect methods such as the performance of gas bubble permeation tests to direct methods such as capturing high resolution images of the membrane active layer surface parameters 3 and 4 are more difficult to verify independently one common method for studying membrane charge density on the surfaces of polyamide membranes is through the use of an electro kinetic analyser membrane charge effects are feed chemistry dependent once electro kinetic data becomes available for calcium sulphate dominated solutions similar to the those studied in this paper it should be possible to incorporate a membrane charge density sub

14223,a predictive nanofiltration model was built in python to be used in reverse osmosis brine treatment processes the model was fitted to rejection data obtained from nf trains functioning as a brine concentrator upstream of a gypsum precipitation reactor at a full scale mine water treatment plant in ahafo ghana over the six month operational period considered september 2017 march 2018 the rejection capability of the installed elements deteriorated considerably this was reflected by a 13 increase in membrane pore radius 40 decrease in effective active layer thickness and an 18 decrease in absolute value of the feed membrane donnan potential performance of elements from other manufacturers was simulated by loading their respective properties into the model cases modelled included a tightly wound dow nf 90 a loosely wound desal ds 5 dl and a koch tfc sr 2 element rejections obtained from the installed mds elements most closely approximated the performance of a loose nf element these modelling studies have shown that the nf model built is capable of modelling nanofiltration in brackish water treatment processes the current disadvantage of the model is the number of membrane specific input parameters which need to be verified with independent experimentation as a start it is recommended that electro kinetic data be obtained for similar solutions to enable a membrane

1 introduction reverse osmosis ro is one of few technologies used for the treatment of mine impacted water exposure of water and oxygen to pyrite inside mine voids generates sulphate and acidity which enables the dissolution of carbonate and silicate based minerals with subsequent liberation of metals including ba2 ca2 and sr2 1 the volumetric recovery achievable in an ro plant is thus very much limited by the sulphate based mineral saturation indices gypsum caso4 2h2o celestite srso4 and barite baso4 in the feed typical ro volumetric recoveries in mine water desalination plants are in the range 70 80 with the remaining brine stream having a high sulphate scaling potential the brine is typically sent to the tailings storage facility tsf and can be re used as makeup water in the mine s mineral recovery process treatment processes are designed for volume reduction sulphate removal and ionic strength reduction of the primary ro brine before being fed into the mine s water reticulation circuit membrane based brine treatment processes typically employ a nanofiltration nf step downstream of the primary ro unit which functions as a concentrator upstream of the gypsum precipitation reactor the nf also produces a permeate stream rich in monovalent species which depending on the no3 and nh4 content can be blended directly with the primary ro permeate to boost the overall volumetric recovery of the facility in specific cases where zero liquid discharge zld is targeted the nf may be incorporated into a recycle loop with intermediate chemical demineralization salts which contain monovalent cations such as nacl kcl and na2so4 are highly soluble in water hence precipitation reactors are not capable of removing monovalent cations in cases where zld is required the nf permeate stream serves as the purge of monovalent species inside the treatment loop its ability to allow passage of monovalent cations as well as its so4 2 rejection capability dictate if a brine bleed requires implementation and hence the possibility of achieving zld modelling of the nf and subsequent element selection thus forms an essential part of the design phase of such projects element suppliers are typically provided with a feed basis from the process consultant and a performance projection is provided based on the element and vessel configuration selected suppliers model the feed water as a combination of single salts nacl na2so4 caso4 etc for which they have salt permeability coefficients b values calibrated with single salt rejection data salt flux obeys a simplified form of the solution diffusion model with flux directly proportional to the chemical potential gradient across the membrane 2 there are multiple properties of nf membranes which enable them to reject dissolved ionic species including the presence of pores on the membrane surface which enable steric size exclusion the development of a fixed charge on the surface of the membrane which excludes ions of the same charge sign from entering the membrane commonly referred to as donnan partitioning or the gibbs donnan effect and confined spaces within the membrane pores restrict the movement of solvent water molecules this leads to a reduction in membrane pore dielectric constant compared to the feed bulk and hence an additional energy barrier for passage through the membrane is created commonly referred to as the born solvation energy barrier the said membrane properties are grouped together with the effect of operating conditions such as solution temperature and ph into a single regression parameter in the simplified solution diffusion model which is problematic for process designers particularly when more rigorous modelling of the system is required the intent of this paper is to present the development of an alternative nf model referred to in literature as the donnan steric pore partitioning and dielectric exclusion dspm de model for use in brine treatment processes the model includes solving the extended nernst planck enp equation for each species inside the active layer of the nf membrane with the mechanisms of diffusion convection and electro migration being considered boundary conditions used for solving the differential equations include partitioning at the feed membrane and membrane permeate interfaces with steric born solvation and donnan partitioning factors included the technique used for solving the equations was based on the paper by geraldes brites alves 3 this involved discretizing the membrane active layer into successive nodes and linearizing the system of equations to get the system to be described in the matrix form a x b with x being the solution vector comprising molar concentrations of each species at each node within the membrane the system of equations was then solved iteratively using lu decomposition theory and gauss elimination with the code being built in the programming language python species included in the system were na ca2 mg2 so4 2 no3 and hco3 all of which are considered to be the dominant ions found in mine impacted water sources feed solutions for the model were built using analytical data from six months of operation of a 4 3 ml day mine water treatment plant for a gold mine in ahafo ghana the initial set of analytical data from september 2017 was used to determine the installed nf elements physical properties this included pore size and active layer thickness a sensitivity analysis was performed to illustrate the effects of donnan partitioning and born solvation on the rejection capability of the membrane for a given set of hydraulic conditions and solution chemistry this enabled an appropriate donnan potential and membrane pore dielectric constant to be determined three additional sets of data are then provided to enable characterization of the element as the operational campaign developed finally elements from other manufacturers were loaded into the model characterized by their pore size and active layer thickness determined elsewhere by other researchers and the individual species rejection compared with the current installed elements 2 methods a conceptual diagram of the nf membrane to be modelled is presented in fig 1 the diagram describes two distinct regions in which mass transfer of solutes occurs 1 through the concentration polarization layer to the feed membrane interface and 2 through the active layer inside the membrane to the membrane permeate interface partitioning of solutes occurs at the feed membrane and membrane permeate interfaces which are dependent on steric donnan partitioning and born solvation effects the concentration polarization layer develops on the feed side due to exclusion of solutes at the feed membrane interface which then diffuse back down a concentration gradient into the bulk solution 2 1 solute mass transfer in boundary layer the net flux of a dissolved ionic species through the concentration polarization layer thus comprises a convective term to account for draw of solute with water in the direction of the hydraulic gradient a diffusive term to account for diffusion towards the feed bulk and an electro migration term which enables an electrical potential to develop to ensure charge balance is maintained at the feed membrane interface 4 computation of the flux is performed using eq 1 and electroneutrality within the boundary layer ensured using eq 2 1 j i j v c i m k c i c i m c i b z i c i m d i f r t ε where j i is the solute flux of species i j v is the water flux c i m is the membrane concentration of species i c i b is the bulk feed concentration of species i z i is the charge of species i d i is the diffusivity in water of species i f is the faraday constant r is the gas

species i at the first node inside the active layer of the membrane c i 1 is related to its molar concentration at the membrane surface c i m according to eq 4 eq 5 relates the molar concentration of species i at the last node inside the active layer of the membrane c i n with the molar concentration of species i in the permeate c i p a t x 0 4 γ i 1 c i 1 γ i m c i m φ i φ b e x p z i f r t δ φ d m a t x δ x e 5 γ i n c i n γ i p c i p φ i φ b e x p z i f r t δ φ d p φ i refers to steric partitioning which occurs at both membrane interfaces and is a function of the solute and membrane pore radii φ i is determined using eq 6 with the assumption that there exists well defined cylindrical pores within the membrane 6 confined spaces within the pores of the membrane results in a reduction in dielectric constant and hence solvation capacity of the fluid which presents a further barrier for ionic species to enter the active layer and is referred to as the born solvation energy barrier δ w i 7 the dielectric exclusion factor φ b is related to δ w i through eq 8 6 φ i 1 r s i r p 2 1 λ i 2 7 δ w i z i 2 e 0 2 8 π ε 0 r s i 1 ε p 1 ε b 8 φ b e x p δ w i k t where r s i is the stokes radius of solute i r p is the membrane pore radius e 0 is the electronic charge constant ε 0 is the vacuum permittivity constant ε p is the membrane pore dielectric constant ε b is the feed bulk solution dielectric constant and k is the boltzmann constant since the ionic species in solution possess different physical stokes radius and electrical charge properties their steric and born partitioning factors vary and hence have differing capabilities to pass into and out of the membrane at the feed membrane and permeate membrane interfaces respectively to maintain charge balance within each region a potential difference is developed at both membrane interfaces δ φ d m the donnan potential at the feed membrane interface and δ φ d p the donnan potential at the membrane permeate interface activity coefficients of each species inside the concentration polarization layer γ i m inside the permeate γ i p and inside the active layer of the membrane γ i 1 n are determined using the davies equation for brackish water sources 8 as shown in appendix b 2 3 solute mass transfer in active layer solute flux through the active layer of the membrane is determined using the enp equation as shown in eq 9 below 9 9 j i d i p d c i d x k i c c i j v z i c i d i p r t f d φ d x due to the confined spaces inside the pores of the active layer a hindrance factor is applied to the diffusion coefficient in the bulk solution d i to provide the hindered diffusion coefficient d i p as shown in eq 10 another hindrance factor is applied to the convective transport term in eq 9 referred to as k i c both hindrance factors are a function of the solute to pore radius and appropriate correlations for each are provided in appendix c 10 11 10 d i p k i d d i in addition to steric and dielectric exclusion phenomena the development of a surface charge density within the active layer of the membrane also plays a prominent role in species rejection mechanisms for surface charge development include 12 ph dependent association dissociation of the hydrophilic functional groups polyamide membranes which constitute the majority of nf membranes in industry have carboxylic acid functional groups cooh under neutral to alkaline conditions the functional group dissociates into the coo ion which contributes to a negative charge density counter ion adsorption onto charged hydrophilic sites this decreases the magnitude of charge developed due to acid base ionization mentioned above and competitive ion adsorption onto the hydrophobic alkyl or aromatic functional groups ch factors influencing adsorption include ion size and charge monovalent anions such as cl and no3 and divalent anions such as so4 2 are more easily adsorbed than their positively charged counterparts due to their smaller stokes radii this enhances the negative surface charge density of nf membranes and has found to be the case for many types of brackish water as well as for sea water the mechanism for ion exclusion due to development of surface charge is introduced in this model by imposing a charge offset at each node inside the active layer of the membrane equal in magnitude to the surface charge density c x as shown in eq 11 below donnan potentials at the feed membrane and membrane permeate interfaces δ φ d m and δ φ d p are thus iterated through to ensure the charge offset is met on the inside of the membrane 11 i 1 n z i c i c x 2 4 solute transfer into the permeate transport through the permeate spacers of the membrane is assumed to be carried out without any hindrance and solute flux is described using the relation provided in eq 12 electroneutrality on the permeate side is ensured by introducing eq 13 12 j i j v c i p 13 i 1 n z i c i p 0 where c i p is the permeate concentration of species i finally flux continuity through the element for each species is ensured by equating the flux equations describing transport within each region of the membrane 14 j i b o u n d a r y l a y e r j i a c t i v e

algorithm for nf model the enp differential equation for flux of each species eq 9 was discretized by dividing the membrane active layer depicted in fig 1 into successive grid nodes with equal spacing δ x j a forward differences scheme was used to approximate the solute concentration and electrical potential gradients within the active layer as shown in eq 17 17 j i d i p c i j l c i j δ x j 1 2 k

linearized according to the method developed by geraldes brites alves 3 the method involves rewritng the equations as linear combinations of c i m c i j c i j 1 and c i p as well as ε φ j φ j 1 and φ

c i m c i j c i j 1 c i p ε φ j φ j 1 and φ p geraldes brites alves 3 wrote their programming code in fortran the authors of this paper however preferred to develop the code in python due to the availability of built in functions for handling of matrices and arrays which allowed for a shorter and more efficient script refer to fig 2 for a logic diagram of the code used in this study the code includes building the coefficient matrix a matrix and solution vector b vector which then solves for the solution vector x vector using lu decomposition and gauss elimination the coeffcient matrix is then updated and solved again the process is repeated until the convergence criteria are met provided in eq 18 below 18 m a x c i j c i j c i j t o l in addition to discretization of the membrane active layer the membrane was also discretized along the feed channel as well feed channel velocity decreases along the element string due to flux of water through to the permeate this reduces each ionic species mass transfer coefficient see appendix a and hence provides for a larger concentration polarization factor when compared to the lead section of the element see eq 1 discretizing the membrane along the feed channel thus allows for more accurate estimation of species concentration at the membrane surface and hence a more accurate overall prediction of rejection species bulk concentration at each successive node within the feed channel was then determined using a mass balance as shown in eq 19 the membrane hydraulics equation eq 16 was then also applied to each node along the element string with the overall permeate flux related to individual node permeate fluxes through the use of eq 20 19 c b i k 1 c b i k 1 j v k s a k q f e e d k j v k s a k q f e e d k c p i k 1 j

2 8 nf model simulation specifications table 1 below provides key design parameters of the installed nf trains at the brine treatment plant in ahafo ghana for all subsequent modelling presented in this paper the array design was kept the same as the installed trains operational data processed by sgs laboratories in tema ghana during the first six months of operation are provided in appendix d data from the initial stages of operation table d1 were used as modelling inputs for determination of the initial pore size and effective active layer thickness of the installed elements the same feed basis was also used to model the performance of membranes from other manufacturers to compare with the installed mds membranes data provided in tables d2 d3 and d4 were used to determine how the installed elements pore size effective active layer thickness and membrane charge density varied as the operational campaign developed appendix e provides physical properties of the ions used in the simulation table 2 lists additional simulation parameters which were kept constant throughout the modelling work 3 results and discussion the intent of fig 3 and fig 4 is to illustrate the effect of membrane charge density and membrane pore dielectric constant both of which are input parameters in the model on individual species rejection in a full scale nanofiltration system species rejection was computed at multiple permeate fluxes via manipulation of the overall train volumetric recovery target for each set of simulations permeate production rate is directly proportional to the applied net driving pressure across the membrane while the rate of dissolved species transport across the membrane is independent of net driving pressure increasing net driving pressure thus increases the difference in transport rate across the membrane between clean water and dissolved solutes providing the impression that dissolved solute rejection increases as permeate flux increases as is clear in both sets of figures the exception in this case is na whose rejection appears to decrease as permeate flux is increased this phenomenon is related to the relative composition of species in the feed solution being studied nanofiltration membranes generally provide relatively high rejection of multivalent ions in this case the dominant cation in solution on a molar basis is ca2 and the dominant anion on a molar basis is so4 2 the degree of separation is greatly enhanced for these species as the rate of water transport across the membrane is increased the behaviour is replicated for hco3 and no3 although to a lesser extent compared to so4 2 due to their smaller ion stokes radii hence there is still a relatively high hco3 and no3 content in the permeate stream to compensate for the lack of ca2 in the permeate stream to maintain charge balance with hco3 and no3 there is a higher flux of na across the membrane the effect of membrane charge density on rejection for the six ion system under study is presented in fig 3 enhancing the negative membrane charge density or feed membrane donnan potential δ φ d m improves so4 2 rejection due to electrostatic repulsion the rejection of ca2 and mg2 reduces with increasing negative charge density due to electrostatic attraction the rejection of monovalent anions no3 and hco3 are accordingly reduced to maintain charge balance with the increased passage of divalent cations the rejection of the monovalent cation na on the other hand is improved to maintain charge balance with the reduced passage of divalent anions the effect of varying the pore dielectric constant on species rejection for the six ion system under study is presented in fig 4 reducing ε p o r e enhances the born solvation energy barrier δ w i for all species at the feed membrane interface and hence the rejection of all species is subsequently improved oatley et al 13 conducted single salt rejection experiments using dow filmtec nf99hf and nf270 elements and fitted the data to the dspm de model to determine an appropriate ε p o r e which was determined to be in the range 37 8 42 2 argelaguet 14 followed the same procedure using desal ds 5 dk elements on sea water and found ε p o r e to be 35 for all further modelling work presented in this paper ε p o r e was set to 37 table 3 below presents estimates of membrane pore size effective active layer thickness and feed membrane donnan potential for the installed nf elements in ahafo ghana as the campaign developed over the first six months of operation a general trend of a decrease in all species rejection is observed with time supported by an increase in rpore and a decrease in δxe so4 2 rejection also deteriorates appreciably with time from 99 6 to 96 2 indicating a change in membrane surface chemistry and the element s inherent ability to adsorb anions to develop a negative charge density these results are supported by an 18 reduction in magnitude of the fitted δϕd m over six months of operation the nf trains in ahafo are subjected to a high fouling and scaling potential feed water and frequent chemical cleans are required to restore the element flux it is thought that the combination of foulant scale and frequent exposure to high and low ph cleans have caused irreversible damage to the membrane active layer and reduced its rejection capability these observations have been made before by other researchers 15 the initial performance of the installed mds elements rpore 0 46 nm δxe 0 25 μm is compared with the simulated performance of elements from other manufacturers in fig 5 below three other membranes were used in the comparison a dow filtec nf90 which is considered to be a relatively tight membrane with rpore 0 34 nm and δxe 1 46 μm 16 a desal ds 5 dl which is considered to be a relatively loose membrane with rpore 0 5 nm and δxe 0 37 μm 17 and a koch tfc sr 2 which is considered to be an intermediate between the two abovementioned membranes with rpore 0 46 nm and δxe 1 09 μm 16 all four membranes used in the simulation contain a polyamide active layer and thus the same value for δ φ d m was used in each case no significant difference in so4 2 rejection is observed for the membranes with a rejection ratio 99 for all cases at a typical volumetric recovery of 40 from this it can be deduced that the donnan exclusion and born solvation effects are dominant with respect to so4 2 rejection for all other species the physical properties of the membrane active layer play a significant role in rejection of consequence is the reduced ca2 rejection for the installed elements compared to the nf90 and tfc sr 2 elements this reduces the gypsum saturation ratio of the nf brine entering the gypsum precipitation reactor which needs to be compensated for by an increase in lime addition on the other hand the combined rejection of monovalent species is enhanced using nf 90 and tfc sr 2 elements with the nf90 in particular more closely resembling an ro membrane this enhances the ionic strength of the nf brine which suppresses the ca2 and so4 2 activity coefficients and hence the gypsum saturation ratio sr another consequence is the increased carbonic species loading entering the reactor the hco3 rejection at 40 recovery is projected to be 73 5 for the nf 90 as opposed to 12 6 for the installed mds elements which ultimately drives up the lime consumption rate the results were used to determine the projected nf brine stream entering the gypsum precipitation reactor for the different elements at 40 recovery phreeqc an open source geochemical modelling software developed by the us geological survey 18 was then used in conjunction with its minteq database for thermodynamic properties of the relevant aqueous species to determine the ionic strength and gypsum sr of each nf brine stream to determine the optimal element the results are presented in table 4 below the nf 90 and tfc sr 2 provide the highest gypsum sr 279 taking into account the increased hco3 loading into the reactor using the nf 90 elements and the fact that the nf 90 is a much tighter membrane with lower pure water permeability the tfc sr 2 in this case would be the optimal element for selection 4 conclusions sensitivity analyses showed donnan exclusion and born solvation effects played the most prominent role in determining the high so4 2 rejection 99 commonly observed using nf membranes for brackish water sources the model was fitted to data obtained from six months of operation of a full scale mine water treatment plant for a gold mine in ahafo ghana to determine how the membrane pore radius effective active layer thickness and membrane charge density varied as the operational campaign developed results showed that all three properties of the membrane deteriorated with time most likely due to a combination of fouling scaling and frequent exposure to high and low ph chemical cleans performance of elements from different manufacturers was then simulated and compared to the installed elements at the plant results showed that the elements most closely resemble a loosely wound nf membrane concern was expressed for the low ca2 rejection obtained with the elements bearing in mind that the nf functions as a concentrator upstream of a gypsum precipitation reactor the projected nf brine streams from each element were then run in phreeqc to determine the element which provided the highest gypsum sr the tightly wound nf 90 and intermediate tfc sr 2 elements provided the same gypsum sr suggesting that the high rejection of monovalent species using the tightly wound element increases the ionic strength of the brine sufficiently to impact the ca2 and so4 2 activity coefficients the tightly wound nf 90 provided a significantly higher hco3 rejection thus increasing the lime addition requirement into the reactor and also has a lower pure water permeability constant compared to the intermediate tfc sr 2 element which was thus considered to be the optimal element for this specific case it must be noted however that if the brine treatment process is modified and the nf placed into a recycle loop with zld targeted then this would not be the case a loosely wound element would be preferred as it would allow passage of monovalent species for which there is no geochemical control inside a precipitation reactor into the permeate stream and thus preventing the requirement for a brine bleed through this study it has been demonstrated that the model is powerful enough to simulate performance of a full scale nanofiltration system with multiple ionic species being considered the model contains enough membrane specific input parameters to describe the behaviour of these complex systems these parameters are 1 membrane pore radius 2 membrane active layer thickness 3 membrane charge density and 4 membrane pore dielectric constant parameters 1 and 2 largely account for the difference in transport behaviour between the larger multivalent ions such as ca2 and mg2 and the smaller univalent ions such as na and no3 parameters 1 and 2 alone cannot describe the high so4 2 rejection 99 and the slightly lower rejection for the multivalent cations 85 95 which is observed in nanofiltration systems across a variety of feed water types parameter 3 i e the effect of donnan partitioning greatly enhances the rejection of so4 2 due to electrostatic repulsion whilst also reducing the rejections of ca2 and mg2 due to electrostatic attraction parameter 4 i e born solvation effects enhance the rejection of all species but has the greatest effect on so4 2 due to its ionic charge and small stokes radius when compared to the multivalent cations the challenge with this model is the ability to verify these input parameters with independent laboratory experiments attempts have been made to verify parameters 1 and 2 using multiple methods these range from indirect methods such as the performance of gas bubble permeation tests to direct methods such as capturing high resolution images of the membrane active layer surface parameters 3 and 4 are more difficult to verify independently one common method for studying membrane charge density on the surfaces of polyamide membranes is through the use of an electro kinetic analyser membrane charge effects are feed chemistry dependent once electro kinetic data becomes available for calcium sulphate dominated solutions similar to the those studied in this paper it should be possible to incorporate a membrane charge density sub

14224,wastewater from dairy manufacturing generally contains high concentrations of organic compounds and high biological oxygen demand bod existing treatment technologies have not always fully delivered the desired effluent standards and they can also be expensive this study proposes to recover the organic components proteins lipids and carbohydrates from alkaline dairy waste streams using ferric chloride fecl3 as a low cost food grade inorganic precipitant ninety nine percent of sample turbidity was removed 80 of protein was recovered and 80 of bod was reduced at optimum conditions ph 10 0 fecl3 concentration of 0 07 w v in alkaline conditions fe3 ions effectively neutralised negatively charged colloidal particles leading to coagulation and sweep flocculation this method was highly effective under alkaline but not under acidic condition at the optimum conditions 27 of total fat 16 of total carbohydrates and 39 of total calcium were also precipitated and recovered upon 2 h of settling the final ph of the treated water self neutralized to 7 0 and the iron content was reduced to 1 ppm the treated water may be used for certain applications and the recovered organic components are suitable for animal feed stock keywords dairy wastewater coagulation recovery ferric chloride zeta potential alkaline ph 1 introduction the dairy industry is one of australia s largest rural industries and produces approximately 9 5 billion liters of milk annually 1 it is also one of the highest effluent generating industries based on effluent volume the majority of process water is generated from washing and cleaning processes this wastewater is characterized by high biological oxygen demand bod because of the presence of fat protein and carbohydrates and its disposal comes at a high financial cost existing effluent treatment facilities at some dairy manufacturing sites can be very conventional resulting in the discharge of an effluent stream with high bod in this study food grade ferric chloride fecl3 will be used to recover organic components and reduce bod from dairy waste streams dairy discharge is rich in nutrients and if recovered with low cost inorganic coagulants the organic component can be used as a viable feedstock inorganic metallic coagulants such as fecl3 are extensively used in water treatment because of high efficiency availability low cost and they function at commonly encountered temperatures colloidal particles suspended in wastewater exhibit brownian motion and repel one another forming a stable dispersed suspension which creates difficulties in downstream operations 2 the addition of fecl3 to wastewater yields iron and chloride ions with positively charged iron ions neutralising negatively charged colloidal particles leading to coagulation also ferric ions can react with hydroxide ions in water to form ferric hydroxide that can adsorb contaminant particles through sweep flocculation resulting in low iron content in the supernatant 2 additional advantages of fecl3 for coagulation treatments include removal of phosphorous and sulphur compounds and enhanced sludge dewatering 3 4 fecl3 is known to remove chemical oxygen demand cod of anaerobically treated molasses wastewater with a much higher efficiency of 89 compared to aluminum chlorohydrate and polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride 5 6 unlike ferric based additives the extensive use of alum al2so4 6h2o has been linked to health hazards and is not considered a safe option for cattle feed stock 7 also the optimum ph range required for effective alum coagulation is 5 8 6 5 which is much lower than the ph for ferric based coagulants which is 7 5 8 0 8 the optimum ph for fecl3 assisted precipitation is reported to be 8 0 at which the cod removal efficiency of biologically treated wastewater is 96 6 9 coagulation using 150 mg l fecl3 in the ph range of 6 5 7 5 coupled with filtration has also been shown to be an effective approach for tannery wastewater treatment when compared with other coagulants such as alum and tio2 10 another study has reported that fecl3 coupled with centrifugation achieved 70 removal of suspended solids in tannery wastewater treatment and was more efficient than alum 11 recovery of macronutrients from effluent using inorganic coagulants is an extensively studied theme however this method is not commonly applied to dairy effluent especially in prevailing alkaline conditions dabhi parmar 3 studied the effect of ferrous sulphate feso4 and fecl3 in dairy effluent under acidic conditions reported a significant reduction in bod and chemical oxygen demand cod fecl3 was most effective at half the concentration of feso4 at ph 4 5 the effect of feso4 fecl3 and alum on the coagulation of solids has been investigated in cheese whey wastewater 12 the authors observed that alum salts were not as effective in reducing cod compared to ferric salts and considerably higher amounts of alum were required to achieve comparable results the study also showed that iron based coagulation resulted in greater sludge settling than alum in the above context the aim of this study was to recover the protein lipids and carbohydrate contents and substantially reduce the bod from dairy waste stream using fecl3 which is a low cost precipitant by optimizing treatment parameters 2 materials and methods untreated dairy wastewater was collected from a commercial manufacturing site producing infant formula and cheese in northern victoria australia chemicals such as nitric acid bicinchoninic acid bca copper

total protein content in wastewater samples was analyzed using the bicinchononic acid assay bca method 13 the sample was treated with bca reagent and copper sulphate pentahydrate and then incubated for 30 min at 37 c and cooled down to 22 c the color developed due to the reaction was measured at 562 nm using a uv vis spectrometer perkin elmer lambda 35 uv vis spectrometer u s a the protein fractions of the waste stream and precipitated sample were analysed with sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sds page under reducing conditions as described by laemmli 14 for

kaleidoscope bio rad 1610375 reached the end of the gel 2 1 2 analysis of total fat content the rose gottlieb method was used to determine total fat content in the dairy waste stream 15 in brief the sample was treated with 1 5 ml ammonia and 10 ml of ethanol to dissolve and precipitate the protein respectively fat was then extracted with 25 ml of diethyl ether and 25 ml petroleum spirit then air dried at 101 c to a constant weight the extraction was done at least in triplicate 2 1 3 carbohydrate analysis total carbohydrates were determined with the phenol sulphuric acid method 16 the sample was treated with 50 μl of 80 phenol and 5 ml of concentrated sulphuric acid and allowed to stand for 10 min at 22 c the sample was then kept in a water bath at 25 30 c maxturdy 30 daihan scientific south korea for 10 20 minutes and the developed color was measured using the uv vis spectrometer listed above at 490 nm high pressure liquid chromatography analysis hplc was used to measure the carbohydrate composition samples were centrifuged at 10 000 g at 22 c and filtered through a 0 45 μm nylon membrane filter to remove residual protein prior to analysis analysis was performed using a

maintained at 40 c and analysis was carried out using a refractive index detector at room temperature 22 c 2 1 4 determination of bod the sample was diluted in a 300 ml bod bottle to achieve a bod depletion of at least 2 mg l the diluted sample was treated with calcium chloride 1 mg l sodium hydroxide 1 n magnesium sulphate 1 mg l and fecl3 1 mg l 17 a mettler toledo seven2go u s a dissolved oxygen meter was used to measure the dissolved oxygen on day 0 d o initial before and after a five day incubation period d o final at 22 c bod was obtained using eq 1 1 b o d m g l d o i n i t i a l d

carried out spectroscopically at 393 366 nm for calcium and 259 94 nm for iron using 2 hno3 as a blank 17 2 2 observation of fat and protein distribution an upright confocal microscope nikon eclipse 90i nikon u s a was used to observe the distribution of fat and protein in the wastewater the sample was stained with nile red 0 1 mg ml acetone and fast green 0 1 mg ml water dyes for 10 min and visualized at 40 magnification at an excitation wavelength of 488 and 633 nm respectively 18 scanning electron microscopy was used to complement confocal microscopy a philips xl 30 scanning electron microscope at a magnification of 200 was used to visualize floc formation after fecl3 treatment the sample was freeze dried and mounted on an aluminium stub using a two sided adhesive carbon tape and gold coated in a splutter coater prior to the observation at an accelerating voltage of 30 kv 2 3 measurement of zeta potential a zeta sizer nano zs malvern instruments ltd malvern uk was used to measure the zeta potential before and after treatment using a refractive index of 1 5 the measurements were carried out at 25 c in triplicate using disposable cuvettes velocity of the particle was measured using laser doppler electrophoresis which is proportional to the field strength and the zeta potential 2 4 measurement of turbidity a turbidity meter hi 93703 hanna instruments australia was used to measure the turbidity of samples before and after treatment with fecl3 a beam of infrared light with a wavelength peaking at 890 nm was passed through a clear vial containing the sample the sample was diluted with milli q water to achieve a turbidity reading below 40 ftu the amount of light scattered by the suspended particles was measured by a sensor positioned at 90 to the direction of infrared light the instrument was equipped with a microprocessor which converted the reading to ftu formazin turbidity unit values at 22 c 2 5 recovery of bioactive components using polyvalent cation fecl3 experiments were carried from ph 4 0 to 10 0 at 1 0 increment at fecl3 concentrations ranging from 0 002 to 0 1 w v the desired ph was adjusted using 1 n sodium hydroxide and 48 nitric acid the concentration of fecl3 was chosen such a way that it produced a net zero or near zero zeta potential of the fecl3 wastewater mixture at the selected ph the sample was mixed at 200 rpm using a magnetic stirrer for 1 min to ensure uniform mixing followed by 30 min of slow mixing at 100 rpm to enhance the floc formation suspensions were then allowed to settle for two hours at 22 c the turbidity of the supernatant solution was measured after 15 30 60 and 120 min during the two hour settling period 2 6 statistical analysis all the experiments were performed at least in triplicate the results are presented as mean standard deviation data were subjected to one way anova using ibm spss version 24 the significance difference between two mean values was determined at 95 confidence level p 0 05 using duncan s test 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of trade waste stream wastewater had a bod value of 1646 mg l and it contained 646 mg l fat 537 mg l protein and 447 mg l carbohydrates table 1 turbidity data showed that the concentration of colloidal and suspended particles was 630 110 ftu the ph of the effluent was 10 0 resulting from the caustic alkali wash cycles employed during cleaning processes table 1 the confocal microscopic image shown in fig 1 confirmed that fat globules yellow are trapped inside the agglomerated mass which primarily consisted of proteins green the configuration of these aggregates agrees with other studies that show milk fat globules are surrounded by protein matrix 18 3 2 precipitation of colloidal particles with ferric chloride fecl3 as shown in fig 2 macromolecular complexes were formed between the colloidal particles of the wastewater and fecl3 in the tested ph 4 0 10 0 and concentration 0 002 and 0 1 w v maximum turbidity removal was observed to be 99 at ph 10 and 0 07 fecl3 concentration data presented in table 2 shows that as the ph decreased and become acidic the concentration of flocculant required to acheive maximum turbdity removal decreased this is due to a lower surface negative charge of the collidal particles at lower ph the colloidal particles tended to lose their negative surface charge and ultimately become positive at the acidic ph hence as the surface charge approached zero the concentration of cationic flocculant required to form aggregates with the colloidal particles was reduced the tabulated data also showed that as the concentration of fecl3 was reduced its ability to lower the turbidity was reduced at acidic ph compared to alkaline ph this is due to a lower ferric hydroxide concentration lowering the flocculation capacity of smaller uncharged colloidal particles these observations indicate that the efficiency of a coagulation process is greatly dependent on coagulant concentration and ph zeta potential or surface charge measurements were also carried out in parallel to determine the optimum concentration of fecl3 needed to achieve maximum turbidity removal zeta potential can be used to optimize the required dosage of flocculants to achieve maximum efficiency results showed that maximum turbidity removal was achieved at each ph when the surface charge was within 10 mv 10 mv in particular when the surface charge was close to neutrality at a zeta potential value of 2 73 mv the percentage turbidity removal is 99 at a flocculant concentration of 0 07 w v fig 3 at the isoelectric point the positively charged ferric chloride balances with the negatively charged colloidal particles resulting in the formation of large flocs that easily settle when the surface charge is close to zero the effectiveness of other parameters affecting coagulation or aggregation is maximised 19 as the surface charge shifts away from the isoelectric point there was a decrease in the percentage turbidity removal this is due to either excess fecl3 molecules or insufficient concentration of fecl3 to balance the negatively charged colloidal particles the final ph of the samples treated with fecl3 at optimum condition decreased to 7 0 and required no further neutralization the reduction in ph was due to the hydrolytic reaction of fecl3 in water the total settling time was 2 h for both samples however most of the precipitation occurred in the first 15 min and changed little beyond this fig 4 scanning electron and confocal microscopic images of the freeze dried flocculated samples are shown in fig 5 a and b the scale bar on the scanning electron image shows that the size of these freeze dried flocculated particles fig 5a was generally larger than 100 μm a note that particle size here does not mean the size of the wet flocculate rather their dried form confocal microscopy images fig 5b confirmed that the fat particles are encased in the protein matrix 3 3 effect of ferric chloride in bod reduction the dairy wastewater had a high bod 1646 mg l due to the presence of organic materials including proteins fats and carbohydrates as inferred from fig 6 treatment with 0 07 w v fecl3 reduced the bod at ph 10 0 by 82 the above conditions were also found to have maximum turbidity removal efficiency of 99 table 2 as the ph reduced from 10 0 to 4 0 the bod removal efficiency dropped significantly to 71 p 0 05 as explained earlier this is due to the lower turbidity removal efficiency of fecl3 in acidic conditions fecl3 was shown to have effective precipitating properties in alkaline conditions with bod reduction in dairy effluent exceeding 80 at ph greater than 6 0 at optimum condition ph 10 and 0 07 w v fecl3 addition it was observed that 80 of total protein was recovered at the end of the precipitation process fig 7 the aforementioned condition has also shown to have maximum turbidity removal table 2 and highest reduction in bod fig 6 as the ph was reduced from 10 0 to 4 0 there was a significant reduction in recovery to 54 at ph 4 0 p 0 05 this is due to the lack of interaction of fecl3 with the protein component at the lower ph as both carried positive charge which lowered electrostatic attraction and formation of flocs fecl3 was also found to be an effective coagulant to recover the protein component in dairy effluent at the studied alkaline conditions with recovery values consistently above 75 at ph 7 0 and at its optimum concentration 0 07 therefore the fecl3 precipitation technology works well at alkaline conditions sds page under reducing conditions fig 8 showed that the concentration of whey proteins was higher than that of caseins in the wastewater sample before fecl3 treatment this is possibly due to the soluble nature of whey proteins and also the common practice of fortification of infant formula with whey proteins to achieve closer resemblance to human milk which has a higher whey protein to casein ratio compared to bovine milk 60 40 in human milk and 20 80 in bovine milk 20 electrophoretic analysis of the samples precipitated using fecl3 further confirmed the total protein content determined using bca analysis the gel showed no bands for both caseins and whey proteins as about 80 of proteins were removed from the waste samples fecl3 acted non selectively and removed both casein and whey protein fractions fig 8 the gel showed a formation of band in the wells at the top of the gel for precipitated sample at ph 10 0 and 0 07 w v fecl3 concentration this is due to the aggregation of proteins during the fecl3 treatment process i e the formation of intermediates in the process of forming insoluble precipitates with higher molecular weights initially these aggregates were soluble in aqueous medium and although they formed complexes with fecl3 they were not large enough to be recovered by the precipitation process glycoproteins and glycolipid are two main types of glycoconjugates in bovine milk milk glycoproteins such as κ casein casein macropeptide and lactoferrin are covalently linked to the carbohydrate fractions around 60 of casein macropeptides are glycosylated similarly about 6 7 11 2 of the total molecular weight of lactoferrin contains a glycan component 21 glycolipids are present in the milk fat globule membrane along with proteins and a large proportion of these glycosylated proteins and lipids can be recovered using fecl3 fig 9 shows that under optimum condition ph 10 0 07 w v fecl3 concentration and 99 turbidity reduction 16 of carbohydrate recovery is achieved as the ph decreased the concentration of carbohydrates in the precipitate also decreased with negligible recovery under acidic conditions at ph 10 0 and 0 07 w v fecl3 addition it was observed that 27 of lipid was recovered the lipid globule trapped by the protein matrix had negative surface charge in alkaline ph and got electrostatically complexed with the positively charged fe3 ions to form large flocs which were easily recovered by precipitation caseins contain substantial concentration of calcium phosphate in their micellar form 22 fig 10 shows that greater recovery of calcium was observed at ph 9 0 and 10 0 under optimum conditions ph 10 0 and 0 07 w v fecl3 concentration the precipitated mass yielded 39 calcium because of the high recovery of protein as the ph was reduced from 10 0 to 4 0 the recovery decreased significantly p 0 05 to 20 due to the lower recovery of positively charged proteins under acidic conditions fig 11 shows the residual iron concentration in the supernatant of samples after fecl3 treatment and recovery of the flocs these treatments were carried out at the optimised fecl3 concentration of 0 07 w v as can be observed the residual iron content is lower at alkaline ph than at acidic ph this is due to the formation of high concentration of ferric hydroxides which have a larger surface area available for adsorption of contaminants the low residual iron content in the supernatants correlates with higher electrostatic complexation between fecl3 and proteins and lipids at alkaline ph when they were negatively or oppositely charged and their effective removal through sweep flocculation 23 4 conclusion wastewater from a dairy manufacturing plant was treated with fecl3 to recover protein fat and lactose and to lower the bod there was 82 reduction in bod in the treated waste stream due to the removal of organic components by precipitation the optimum conditions for the recovery of the organic components were ph 10 0 and 0 07 w v fecl3 concentration which removed 99 turbidity eighty percent of the total protein was precipitated by this treatment at these optimized conditions after precipitation the ph of the treated samples decreased naturally to 7 0 without any need for neutralization the residual iron content of the supernatant was as low as 1 ppm allowing the treated water to be re used for cleaning purposes precipitation of biological residues from dairy wastewater with fecl3 is potentially operationally cost effective at low dosages and requires little capital investment this process is also versatile and suitable for small or large scale manufacturing as the precipitate can be separated by simple sedimentation or by centrifugation the gras status of fecl3 makes the precipitate suitable to use as an additive in animal feed stock because of the high protein content acknowledgements the research was supported by rmit university australia and australian government the authors acknowledge the help

14224,wastewater from dairy manufacturing generally contains high concentrations of organic compounds and high biological oxygen demand bod existing treatment technologies have not always fully delivered the desired effluent standards and they can also be expensive this study proposes to recover the organic components proteins lipids and carbohydrates from alkaline dairy waste streams using ferric chloride fecl3 as a low cost food grade inorganic precipitant ninety nine percent of sample turbidity was removed 80 of protein was recovered and 80 of bod was reduced at optimum conditions ph 10 0 fecl3 concentration of 0 07 w v in alkaline conditions fe3 ions effectively neutralised negatively charged colloidal particles leading to coagulation and sweep flocculation this method was highly effective under alkaline but not under acidic condition at the optimum conditions 27 of total fat 16 of total carbohydrates and 39 of total calcium were also precipitated and recovered upon 2 h of settling the final ph of the treated water self neutralized to 7 0 and the iron content was reduced to 1 ppm the treated water may be used for certain applications and the recovered organic components are suitable for animal feed stock keywords dairy wastewater coagulation recovery ferric chloride zeta potential alkaline ph 1 introduction the dairy industry is one of australia s largest rural industries and produces approximately 9 5 billion liters of milk annually 1 it is also one of the highest effluent generating industries based on effluent volume the majority of process water is generated from washing and cleaning processes this wastewater is characterized by high biological oxygen demand bod because of the presence of fat protein and carbohydrates and its disposal comes at a high financial cost existing effluent treatment facilities at some dairy manufacturing sites can be very conventional resulting in the discharge of an effluent stream with high bod in this study food grade ferric chloride fecl3 will be used to recover organic components and reduce bod from dairy waste streams dairy discharge is rich in nutrients and if recovered with low cost inorganic coagulants the organic component can be used as a viable feedstock inorganic metallic coagulants such as fecl3 are extensively used in water treatment because of high efficiency availability low cost and they function at commonly encountered temperatures colloidal particles suspended in wastewater exhibit brownian motion and repel one another forming a stable dispersed suspension which creates difficulties in downstream operations 2 the addition of fecl3 to wastewater yields iron and chloride ions with positively charged iron ions neutralising negatively charged colloidal particles leading to coagulation also ferric ions can react with hydroxide ions in water to form ferric hydroxide that can adsorb contaminant particles through sweep flocculation resulting in low iron content in the supernatant 2 additional advantages of fecl3 for coagulation treatments include removal of phosphorous and sulphur compounds and enhanced sludge dewatering 3 4 fecl3 is known to remove chemical oxygen demand cod of anaerobically treated molasses wastewater with a much higher efficiency of 89 compared to aluminum chlorohydrate and polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride 5 6 unlike ferric based additives the extensive use of alum al2so4 6h2o has been linked to health hazards and is not considered a safe option for cattle feed stock 7 also the optimum ph range required for effective alum coagulation is 5 8 6 5 which is much lower than the ph for ferric based coagulants which is 7 5 8 0 8 the optimum ph for fecl3 assisted precipitation is reported to be 8 0 at which the cod removal efficiency of biologically treated wastewater is 96 6 9 coagulation using 150 mg l fecl3 in the ph range of 6 5 7 5 coupled with filtration has also been shown to be an effective approach for tannery wastewater treatment when compared with other coagulants such as alum and tio2 10 another study has reported that fecl3 coupled with centrifugation achieved 70 removal of suspended solids in tannery wastewater treatment and was more efficient than alum 11 recovery of macronutrients from effluent using inorganic coagulants is an extensively studied theme however this method is not commonly applied to dairy effluent especially in prevailing alkaline conditions dabhi parmar 3 studied the effect of ferrous sulphate feso4 and fecl3 in dairy effluent under acidic conditions reported a significant reduction in bod and chemical oxygen demand cod fecl3 was most effective at half the concentration of feso4 at ph 4 5 the effect of feso4 fecl3 and alum on the coagulation of solids has been investigated in cheese whey wastewater 12 the authors observed that alum salts were not as effective in reducing cod compared to ferric salts and considerably higher amounts of alum were required to achieve comparable results the study also showed that iron based coagulation resulted in greater sludge settling than alum in the above context the aim of this study was to recover the protein lipids and carbohydrate contents and substantially reduce the bod from dairy waste stream using fecl3 which is a low cost precipitant by optimizing treatment parameters 2 materials and methods untreated

2 concentrated loading dye laemelle buffer bio rad 1610737 with 200 mm β mercaptoethanol in 1 2 ratios and boiled at 95 c for 10 min gels were run for 30 min at 200 v or until the bottom ladder kaleidoscope bio rad 1610375 reached the end of the gel 2 1 2 analysis of total fat content the rose gottlieb method was used to determine total fat content in the dairy waste stream 15 in brief the sample was treated with 1 5 ml ammonia and 10 ml of ethanol to dissolve and precipitate the protein respectively fat was then extracted with 25 ml of diethyl ether and 25 ml petroleum spirit then air dried at 101 c to a constant weight the extraction was done at least in triplicate 2 1 3 carbohydrate analysis total carbohydrates were determined with the phenol sulphuric acid method 16 the sample

south korea for 10 20 minutes and the developed color was measured using the uv vis spectrometer listed above at 490 nm high pressure liquid chromatography analysis hplc was used to measure the carbohydrate composition samples were centrifuged at 10 000 g at 22 c and filtered through a 0 45 μm nylon membrane filter to remove residual protein prior to analysis analysis was performed using a luna 5 μm nh2 100 aº lc column of inner diameter 250 6 mm phenoemenex australia the solvent was 80 acetonitrile run as an isocratic elution at a flow rate of 3 ml minute the column temperature was maintained at 40 c and analysis was carried out using a refractive index detector at room temperature 22 c 2 1 4 determination of bod the sample was diluted in a 300 ml bod bottle to achieve a bod depletion of at least 2 mg l the diluted sample was treated with calcium chloride 1 mg l sodium hydroxide 1 n magnesium sulphate 1 mg l and fecl3 1 mg l 17 a mettler toledo seven2go u s a dissolved oxygen meter was used to measure the dissolved oxygen on day 0 d o initial before and after a five day incubation period d o final at 22 c bod was obtained using eq 1 1 b o d m g l d o i n i t i a l d

carried out spectroscopically at 393 366 nm for calcium and 259 94 nm for iron using 2 hno3 as a blank 17 2 2 observation of fat and protein distribution an upright confocal microscope nikon eclipse 90i nikon u s a was used to observe the distribution of fat and protein in the wastewater the sample was stained with nile red 0 1 mg ml acetone and fast green 0 1 mg ml water dyes for 10 min and visualized at 40 magnification at an excitation wavelength of 488 and 633 nm respectively 18 scanning electron microscopy was used to complement confocal microscopy a philips xl 30 scanning electron microscope at a magnification of 200 was used to visualize floc formation after fecl3 treatment the sample was freeze dried and mounted on an aluminium stub using a two sided adhesive carbon tape and gold coated in a splutter coater prior to the observation at an accelerating voltage of 30 kv 2 3 measurement of zeta potential a zeta sizer nano zs malvern instruments ltd malvern uk was used to measure the zeta potential before and after treatment using a refractive index of 1 5 the measurements were carried out at 25 c in triplicate using disposable cuvettes velocity of the particle was measured using laser doppler electrophoresis which is proportional to the field strength and the zeta potential 2 4 measurement of turbidity a turbidity meter hi 93703 hanna instruments australia was used to measure the turbidity of samples before and after treatment with fecl3 a beam of infrared light with a wavelength peaking at 890 nm was passed through a clear vial containing the sample the sample was diluted with milli q water to achieve a turbidity reading below 40 ftu the amount of light scattered by the suspended particles was measured by a sensor positioned at 90 to the direction of infrared light the instrument was equipped with a microprocessor which converted the reading to ftu formazin turbidity unit values at 22 c 2 5 recovery of bioactive components using polyvalent cation fecl3 experiments were carried from ph 4 0 to 10 0 at 1 0 increment at fecl3 concentrations ranging from 0 002 to 0 1 w v the desired ph was adjusted using 1 n sodium hydroxide and 48 nitric acid the concentration of fecl3 was chosen such a way that it produced a net zero or near zero zeta potential of the fecl3 wastewater mixture at the selected ph the sample was mixed at 200 rpm using a magnetic stirrer for 1 min to ensure uniform mixing followed by 30 min of slow mixing at 100 rpm to enhance the floc formation suspensions were then allowed to settle for two hours at 22 c the turbidity of the supernatant solution was measured after 15 30 60 and 120 min during the two hour settling period 2 6 statistical analysis all the experiments were performed at least in triplicate the results are presented as mean standard deviation data were subjected to one way anova using ibm spss version 24 the significance difference between two mean values was determined at 95 confidence level p 0 05 using duncan s test 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of trade waste stream wastewater had a bod value of 1646 mg l and it contained 646 mg l fat 537 mg l protein and 447 mg l carbohydrates table 1 turbidity data showed that the concentration of colloidal and suspended particles was 630 110 ftu the ph of the effluent was 10 0 resulting from the caustic alkali wash cycles employed during cleaning processes table 1 the confocal microscopic image shown in fig 1 confirmed that fat globules yellow are trapped inside the agglomerated mass which primarily consisted of proteins green the configuration of these aggregates agrees with other studies that show milk fat globules are surrounded by protein matrix 18 3 2 precipitation of colloidal particles with ferric chloride fecl3 as shown in fig 2 macromolecular complexes were formed between the colloidal particles of the wastewater and fecl3 in the tested ph 4 0 10 0 and concentration 0 002 and 0 1 w v maximum turbidity removal was observed to be 99 at ph 10 and 0 07 fecl3 concentration data presented in table 2 shows that as the ph decreased and become acidic the concentration of flocculant required to acheive maximum turbdity removal decreased this is due to a lower surface negative charge of the collidal particles at lower ph the colloidal particles tended to lose their negative surface charge and ultimately become positive at the acidic ph hence as the surface charge approached zero the concentration of cationic flocculant required to form aggregates with the colloidal particles was reduced the tabulated data also showed that as the concentration of fecl3 was reduced its ability to lower the turbidity was reduced at acidic ph compared to alkaline ph this is due to a lower ferric hydroxide concentration lowering the flocculation capacity of smaller uncharged colloidal particles these observations indicate that the efficiency of a coagulation process is greatly dependent on coagulant concentration and ph zeta potential or surface charge measurements were also carried out in parallel to determine the optimum concentration of fecl3 needed to achieve maximum turbidity removal zeta potential can be used to optimize the required dosage of flocculants to achieve maximum efficiency results showed that maximum turbidity removal was achieved at each ph when the surface charge was within 10 mv 10 mv in particular when the surface charge was close to neutrality at a zeta potential value of 2 73 mv the percentage turbidity removal is 99 at a flocculant concentration of 0 07 w v fig 3 at the isoelectric point the positively charged ferric chloride balances with the negatively charged colloidal particles resulting in the formation of large flocs that easily settle when the surface charge is close to zero the effectiveness of other parameters affecting coagulation or aggregation is maximised 19 as the surface charge shifts away from the isoelectric point there was a decrease in the percentage turbidity removal this is due to either excess fecl3 molecules or insufficient concentration of fecl3 to balance the negatively charged colloidal particles the final ph of the samples treated with fecl3 at optimum condition decreased to 7 0 and required no further neutralization the reduction in ph was due to the hydrolytic reaction of fecl3 in water the total settling time was 2 h for both samples however most of the precipitation occurred in the first 15 min and changed little beyond this fig 4 scanning electron and confocal microscopic images of the freeze dried flocculated samples are shown in fig 5 a and b the scale bar on the scanning electron image shows that the size of these freeze dried flocculated particles fig 5a was generally larger than 100 μm a note that particle size here does not mean the size of the wet flocculate rather their dried form confocal microscopy images fig 5b confirmed that the fat particles are encased in the protein matrix 3 3 effect of ferric chloride in bod reduction the dairy wastewater had a high bod 1646 mg l due to the presence of organic materials including proteins fats and carbohydrates as inferred from fig 6 treatment with 0 07 w v fecl3 reduced the bod at ph 10 0 by 82 the above conditions were also found to have maximum turbidity removal efficiency of 99 table 2 as the ph reduced from 10 0 to 4 0 the bod removal efficiency dropped significantly to 71 p 0 05 as explained earlier this is due to the lower turbidity removal efficiency of fecl3 in acidic conditions fecl3 was shown to have effective precipitating properties in alkaline conditions with bod reduction in dairy effluent exceeding 80 at ph greater than 6 0 at optimum condition ph 10 and 0 07 w v fecl3 addition it was observed that 80 of total protein was recovered at the end of the precipitation process fig 7 the aforementioned condition has also shown to have maximum turbidity removal table 2 and highest reduction in bod fig 6 as the ph was reduced from 10 0 to 4 0 there was a significant reduction in recovery to 54 at ph 4 0 p 0 05 this is due to the lack of interaction of fecl3 with the protein component at the lower ph as both carried positive charge which lowered electrostatic attraction and formation of flocs fecl3 was also found to be an effective coagulant to recover the protein component in dairy effluent at the studied alkaline conditions with recovery values consistently above 75 at ph 7 0 and at its optimum concentration 0 07 therefore the fecl3 precipitation technology works well at alkaline conditions sds page under reducing conditions fig 8 showed that the concentration of whey proteins was higher than that of caseins in the wastewater sample before fecl3 treatment this is possibly due to the soluble nature of whey proteins and also the common practice of fortification of infant formula with whey proteins to achieve closer resemblance to human milk which has a higher whey protein to casein ratio compared to bovine milk 60 40 in human milk and 20 80 in bovine milk 20 electrophoretic analysis of the samples precipitated using fecl3 further confirmed the total protein content determined using bca analysis the gel showed no bands for both caseins and whey proteins as about 80 of proteins were removed from the waste samples fecl3 acted non selectively and removed both casein and whey protein fractions fig 8 the gel showed a formation of band in the wells at the top of the gel for precipitated sample at ph 10 0 and 0 07 w v fecl3 concentration this is due to the aggregation of proteins during the fecl3 treatment process i e the formation of intermediates in the process of forming insoluble precipitates with higher molecular weights initially these aggregates were soluble in aqueous medium and although they formed complexes with fecl3 they were not large enough to be recovered by the precipitation process glycoproteins and glycolipid are two main types of glycoconjugates in bovine milk milk glycoproteins such as κ casein casein macropeptide and lactoferrin are covalently linked to the carbohydrate fractions around 60 of casein macropeptides are glycosylated similarly about 6 7 11 2 of the total molecular weight of lactoferrin contains a glycan component 21 glycolipids are present in the milk fat globule membrane along with proteins and a large proportion of these glycosylated proteins and lipids can be recovered using fecl3 fig 9 shows that under optimum condition ph 10 0 07 w v fecl3 concentration and 99 turbidity reduction 16 of carbohydrate recovery is achieved as the ph decreased the concentration of carbohydrates in the precipitate also decreased with negligible recovery under acidic conditions at ph 10 0 and 0 07 w v fecl3 addition it was observed that 27 of lipid was recovered the lipid globule trapped by the protein matrix had negative surface charge in alkaline ph and got electrostatically complexed with the positively charged fe3 ions to form large flocs which were easily recovered by precipitation caseins contain substantial concentration of calcium phosphate in their micellar form 22 fig 10 shows that greater recovery of calcium was observed at ph 9 0 and 10 0 under optimum conditions ph 10 0 and 0 07 w v fecl3 concentration the precipitated mass yielded 39 calcium because of the high recovery of protein as the ph was reduced from 10 0 to 4 0 the recovery decreased significantly p 0 05 to 20 due to the lower recovery of positively charged proteins under acidic conditions fig 11 shows the residual iron concentration in the supernatant of samples after fecl3 treatment and recovery of the flocs these treatments were carried out at the optimised fecl3 concentration of 0 07 w v as can be observed the residual iron content is lower at alkaline ph than at acidic ph this is due to the formation of high concentration of ferric hydroxides which have a larger surface area available for adsorption of contaminants the low residual iron content in the supernatants correlates with higher electrostatic complexation between fecl3 and proteins and lipids at alkaline ph when they were negatively or oppositely charged and their effective removal through sweep flocculation 23 4 conclusion wastewater from a dairy manufacturing plant was treated with fecl3 to recover protein fat and lactose and to lower the bod there was 82 reduction in bod in the treated waste stream due to the removal of organic components by precipitation the optimum conditions for the recovery of the organic components were ph 10 0 and 0 07 w v fecl3 concentration which removed 99 turbidity eighty percent of the total protein was precipitated by this treatment at these optimized conditions after precipitation the ph of the treated samples decreased naturally to 7 0 without any need for neutralization the residual iron content of the supernatant was as low as 1 ppm allowing the treated water to be re used for cleaning purposes precipitation of biological residues from dairy wastewater with fecl3 is potentially operationally cost effective at low dosages and requires little capital investment this process is also versatile and suitable for small or large scale manufacturing as the precipitate can be separated by simple sedimentation or by centrifugation the gras status of fecl3 makes the precipitate suitable to use as an additive in animal feed stock because of the high protein content acknowledgements the research was supported by rmit university australia and australian government the authors acknowledge the help
