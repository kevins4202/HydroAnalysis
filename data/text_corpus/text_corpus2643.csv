significant problems associated with harmful algal blooms have been emerging because of climate change and artificial nutrient enrichment from anthropogenic activities 1 algal eutrophication releases significant amounts of algal organic matter aom which is composed mainly of proteins polysaccharides lipids and nucleic acids 2 aom can be categorized into extracellular organic matter i e the by products of algal metabolism excreted from living cells and intracellular organic matter i e materials released during cell autolysis 3 elevated aom content in water bodies is accompanied by well known taste and odor compounds such as geosmin and 2 methyl isoborneol as well as microcystins i e the most common group of cyanotoxins 4 5 aom also has low aromaticity and high dissolved organic nitrogen don content 6 conventional water treatment processes such as coagulation sedimentation filtration are thus not efficient on aom because of its hydrophilic nature 7 for example the polysaccharides in aom deteriorate the coagulation or flocculation performance owing to their ability to form stable hydrocolloid 2 the protein components of aom have surface activity and can interact with dissolved cations resulting in membrane fouling 8 aom has the potential to form a disinfection by product dbp upon chlorination owing to its high don content 9 11 to decrease the abundance of harmful algal blooms in water bodies various treatments such as coagulation clarification filtration flotation uv persulfate treatment photolysis ozone and chlorine treatment and algicide treatment have been developed which are complex expensive and may worsen the concentration of toxins in the water body 12 14 compared to these technologies ultrasonication has gained increasing attention for controlling algal blooms because it is environment friendly easy to operate and does not require additional chemicals 13 14 several studies have investigated the removal of algal blooms using ultrasonication mainly focusing on its influence on enhancing the removal of algae and the subsequent inhibition of algal growth 12 14 19 moreover ultrasonic pre treatment for the removal of microcystis aeruginosa via coagulation has been successfully demonstrated 20 ultrasonication of water accounts for compression sequences and rarefaction cycles that generate acoustic cavitation during this process countless bubbles collapse swiftly at a localized temperature as high as 5000 k and pressure up to 100 mpa while producing free radicals 12 17 hence ultrasonication can successfully lead to functional and structural damage in microalgae aom consists of extracellular and intracellular organic matter which is released into water and the high amount of don in intracellular organic matter can generate substantial quantities of dbps 12 21 as described above accurate characterization of the composition of aom is crucial for a deeper understanding particularly for maximizing the performance of ultrasonication treatment to reduce the adverse effects of aom pollution on aquatic ecosystems as well as for post sonication water treatment processes bulk parameters such as ultraviolet visible uv vis absorption coefficients and dissolved organic carbon doc have been widely used to monitor the fate of aom 7 22 23 however the majority of scientific literature has proposed that these parameters are not satisfactory for tracking the heterogeneous nature of aom 24 25 the fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem combined with parallel factor analysis i e eem parafac has emerged as a powerful tool owing to its high sensitivity rapid processing and easy to use methodology which can successfully categorize the bulk of fluorescent dissolved organic matter into its individual components 3 26 28 eem parafac has been previously applied for tracking phytoplankton 29 32 the quantification of cyanobacteria that contain phycocyanin 29 33 and the estimation of bloom formation 34 fluorescence has thus proven to be a valuable tool for on site detection and estimation of phytoplankton populations as well as their potential toxicity despite the increasingly widespread use of eem parafac few studies have used eem to characterize the fate of the aom released during ultrasonication 12 35 36 to the best of our knowledge this method has not yet been used upon the ultrasonication treatment of algal blooms in order to investigate fluorescence based descriptors for microalgal disintegration and related production of aom in this study the effectiveness of ultrasonication in microalgae disruption and associated organic matter was evaluated using spectroscopic and fluorescence indices the objectives of this study were 1 to investigate changes in different spectroscopic indices of aom and 2 to determine fluorescence surrogates for monitoring variations in aom and the calculation of microalgae count destroyed during ultrasonication to the best of our knowledge this is the first study to assess the systematic performance of spectroscopic descriptors for probing microalgal disintegration upon ultrasonication and to set a path for developing a real time monitoring technology for the removal of algal blooms 2 materials and methodology 2 1 materials in this study chlorella vulgaris was used for analyses as it is a common algal blooming species 21 37 the c vulgaris strain ag10002 was purchased from the korean culture type collection south korea and was grown in bg 11 medium as described in section 2 2 microalgae were ultrasonicated at 20 khz using a 750 w vibra cell ultrasonic processor vc750 sonics materials inc usa equipped with a horn tip 25 mm in diameter as well as a temperature probe the sytox green nucleic acid stain invitrogen life technologies grand island usa was used to stain microalgae cells and the cell viability was measured using flow cytometry standard ratp and bactiter glo promega madison wi usa were used to measure the calibration curve see fig s1 to convert the relative luminescence unit to adenosine triphosphate atp concentration and the atp concentration in ultrasonication samples respectively relative luminescence values were recorded using a luminometer glomax 20 20 promega immediately before and after each ultrasonication experiment approximately 1 ml of mixed liquor was centrifuged and the supernatant was used to determine the concentration of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 using pierce quantitative peroxide assay kits thermo scientific rockford il usa and a uv vis spectrophotometer dr5000 hach germany all chemical reagents used in this study were analytical grade unless specified otherwise 2 2 microalgae cultivation and sample preparation the stock culture of c vulgaris was prepared under growth conditions as described in our previous studies 38 40 microalgae were grown in 2 l reactors containing 1 6 l of autoclaved bg 11 medium aerated with a mixture of ambient air 90 and co2 10 at a flow rate of 45 ml min 1 under continuous mixing at 100 rpm using a magnetic stirrer the glass bottle reactor was incubated under continuous illumination with white fluorescent light of 5000 6000 lx at 25 c and light intensity was measured using an auto digital luxmeter victor 1010a for ultrasonication experiments microalgae in the stationary growth phase i e between 14 and 17 days of incubation 41 were collected via centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 10 min at room temperature washed three times with mineral bottled water and transferred into modified bg 11 medium see table s1 at an optical density od 680 nm of 0 3 cm 1 corresponding to an initial cell concentration of 2 6 106 cells ml the regular bg 11 medium was modified by eliminating the addition of citric acid and ferric ammonium citrate while nano3 addition was reduced by 50 these modifications were considered to minimize the influence of the medium components on the characterization of the released aom during ultrasonication 2 3 ultrasonication treatment ultrasonication experiments were conducted at different powers of 0 039 0 08 0 164 and 0 32 w ml and for each instance power was applied for 5 10 15 and 20 min microalgae suspension samples before ultrasonication i e at 0 min were used as controls the power range was chosen based on previous studies 15 18 42 joyce et al 2010 reported that a temperature rise of 18 30 c has no damaging effect on microalgae for up to 30 min 15 the temperature for ultrasonication was maintained at 22 2 c using an ice bath the sonicator probe was inserted 2 5 3 cm into the center of the microalgal suspension and each ultrasonication experiment was conducted twice the acoustic power entering the suspension was measured using calorimetry as described in previous studies 43 44 two hundred milliliters of water were continuously sonicated for 20 min at different amplitudes i e 20 40 60 80 and 100 temperature was recorded every 10 s starting at the ambient temperature this was carried out thrice for each amplitude and the equation below was used to calculate the ultrasonic power fig s2 shows the power output at different amplitudes w t t cp m where w is the power in watts t t is the slope of the regression curve t is the temperature in k t is time in seconds cp is the water heat capacity 4 18 j kg 1 k 1 and m is the mass of the water sample in kg 2 4 counting microalgae flow cytometry adenosine triphosphate and optical density to determine the number of intact and destructed microalgae cells flow cytometry fcm analysis was conducted using a partec cyflow cube 6 flow cytometer partec gmbh görlitz germany equipped with a 20 mw laser emitting at a wavelength of 488 nm the quantification of intact and destroyed microalgae cells was conducted as described in previous studies 45 46 the sytox green nucleic acid stain was used to stain the microalgae cells that had damaged cell membranes as well as their nucleic acid sytox green stock solution 100 μm was prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide and stored at 20 c in the dark the stock solution was diluted with milli q water to prepare the working solution 50 μm the cells were stained by adding 20 μl of the working solution to 0 98 ml of the microalgae sample in order to achieve a 1 μm concentration of sytox green the samples were incubated in darkness at 36 c for 10 min diluted 10 v v using milli q water and were subsequently injected into the flow cytometer all fcm data were processed using the fcs4 express cytometry software de novo software glendale ca usa the electronic gating application of the software was used to separate positive signals from microalgae cells and to exclude noise from non microalgal particles or instruments itself by control experiments see fig s3 the background noise region was briefly excluded from the microalgae cells region using filtrates of only modified bg 11 media and intact and temperature killed microalgae samples and all samples were filtered with 0 45 μm hydrophilic polyethersulfone syringe filters advantec toyo roshi kaisha ltd japan after staining sytox bound to the nucleic acids of destructed microalgae and produced green fluorescence at 530 nm but could not penetrate intact cells wherein chlorophyll auto fluorescence produced red fluorescence at 620 nm the flow cytometer detected green fluorescence from the fl1 channel i e 530 nm and red fluorescence from the fl3 channel i e 620 nm which represented the destroyed and intact microalgae cells respectively cellular atp is released into the extracellular environment through damaged cell membranes soluble atp concentration was determined to complement the results of damaged cells measured using fcm the soluble atp content was determined according to previous studies 47 briefly microalgae suspensions before and after ultrasonication were immediately filtered using a 0 1 μm polyethersulfone sterile syringe filter sartorius germany the atp reagent 100 μl was added to 100 μl of the filtered sample and incubated in the dark at 36 c for 2 min bactiter glo promega the relative luminescence values were recorded using a luminometer and converted to atp concentrations using the calibration curve see fig s1 microalgae samples were subjected to uv vis scanning immediately before and after ultrasonication from 300 to 800 nm at 2 nm intervals using a uv vis spectrophotometer dr5000 hach germany fig s4 shows the corresponding spectra the value at 680 nm i e od680 for each sample was used to estimate the concentration of microalgae 48 2 5 dissolved organic matter characteristics dissolved organic carbon uv vis spectroscopic descriptors fluorescence eem parafac and size exclusion chromatography prior to measuring water quality all samples were filtered with 0 45 μm hydrophilic polyethersulfone advantec toyo roshi kaisha ltd japan in order to avoid any undesirable adsorption onto the filter as well as carbon bleeding from the filter 49 uv vis spectra were obtained from 200 to 800 nm wavelength with a 1 cm quartz cuvette on a spectrophotometer dr 5000 hach usa and doc was determined using a total organic carbon analyzer toc v cpn shimadzu japan the specific uv absorbance suva value was calculated by normalizing 100 fold uv254 to the concentration of doc in the water sample and was used for the rough estimation of aom aromaticity the log transformation of the absorption spectra of two distinct slope regions such as the spectral slope i e s274 294 was calculated from the log transformation of the slope from 274 to 295 nm the spectral slope ratio sr was calculated as 274 294 nm divided by 350 400 nm which has been reported as an indicator of the molecular weight mw of organic matter 50 51 the absorbance slope index asi represents variation in the chromophores corresponding to the activated of aromatic groups 250 nm relative to carboxylic and aromatic groups e g 200 230 nm in organic matter 52 each measurement was performed thrice asi 0 56 a 250 a 272 a 220 a 230 prior to spectroscopic analysis all water samples were filtered 0 45 μm and diluted to a uv254 value of 0 05 in order to avoid the effect of the inner filter on fluorescence spectra 53 fluorescence spectra were measured in a three dimensional eem using a fluorescence spectrometer shimadzu rf 5301pc the emission em spectra were scanned in an area of 280 nm 550 nm at 1 nm wavelength intervals while the excitation ex spectra were scanned from 220 to 500 nm at intervals of 5 nm eem spectra of milli q water i e blank were subtracted from the eem samples and parafac modeling was conducted for all eem spectra samples collected both before and after ultrasonication of microalgae in total 71 fluorescence eem data arrays were subjected to parafac analysis using the domfluor toolbox 54 in matlab 9 8 r2020a mathworks natick ma usa after removing scattering from the eem spectra residual analysis and split half validation were applied to identify the correct number of components fmax refers to the maximum fluorescence intensity of individual components and raman unit equivalents were used to normalize the obtained fluorescence intensity 55 fluorescence based indices such as the biological index bix and the humification index hix were calculated from eem fluorescence the hix was estimated from the emission spectrum region at a wavelength of 435 480 nm divided by 300 345 nm at an excitation wavelength of 255 nm 50 56 bix was calculated from the ratio of the emission area under 380 430 nm at an excitation wavelength of 310 nm 50 size exclusion chromatography sec equipped with an uv and doc system along with an organic carbon detector ocd and ultraviolet detector uvd was employed to determine the mw characteristics of aom before and after sonication lc ocd model 8 system doc labor karlsruhe germany 57 these characteristics were classified into the following fractions 1 biopolymer bp 20 kda 2 humic like substances hs 1 kda 3 building blocks bb 300 500 da 4 low molecular weight acids lmw a 350 da and charged and 5 low molecular weight neutrals lmw n 350 da fig s5 presents the representative ocd and uvd chromatograms of aom both before and after ultrasonication treatment with their peaks indicating individual size fractions 2 6 statistical analysis all statistical analyses were performed using the origin pro 8 1 software package the performance of the ultrasonication treatment was validated using a one way anova at 95 confidence interval principal component analysis pca was performed on a set of data obtained from ultrasonication experiments such as destroyed cell counts measured via fcm soluble atp concentration bulk organic parameters e g doc and uv254 suva other absorption based descriptors e g s274 294 sr and asi fmax value of each intensity fluorescence indices e g hix and bix and mw fractions e g bp hs bb lmw n and lmw a in order to determine the pearson s correlation between aom descriptors and the destroyed microalgae count 3 results and discussion 3 1 microalgal disintegration it was speculated that the microalgal disintegration increased with increasing both ultrasonication powers 0 039 0 32 w ml and the treatment time at 5 min intervals for up to 20 min see fig 1a in this study a higher ultrasonic power i e 0 32 w ml was more efficient for microalgae disintegration this is because a high ultrasonic intensity causes intense cavitation and accelerated sonochemical effects 42 43 statistically increasing ultrasonication power up to 10 min showed the highest correlation coefficient with destroyed cells r2 0 90 p 0 05 for example the destructed cell count reached up to 23 36 52 and 66 with ultrasonication powers of 0 039 0 08 0 164 and 0 32 w ml respectively transferred for 10 min however there was no significant difference in the count of damaged cells with any further increase in time i e above 10 min this can be considered the optimized ultrasonication time for this study this trend of microalgal disintegration at different ultrasonication powers and times is in accordance with that in previous studies 15 18 primary microalgal disintegration during ultrasonication has been associated with mechanical rupture of the cell membrane and collapse of gas vesicles due to ultrasonic transient cavitation 12 58 acoustic cavitation can also generate h2o2 59 the mutual contribution of these sonolysis and hydroxyl radicals can alter cell membrane permeability which plays a role in further damaging intracellular organelles from hydroxyl radicals 60 61 h2o2 generation was determined in this study see fig 1b h2o2 is produced as a result of the decomposition of water h2o during sonication due to cavitation collapse during 15 min of ultrasonication h2o2 content was increased to 3 7 8 3 18 and 18 9 μmol l for different power values of 0 039 0 08 0 164 and 0 32 w ml respectively however a slight decrease of 9 and 12 in h2o2 generation was observed at 0 164 and 0 32 w ml respectively when the ultrasonication time was increased from 15 to 20 min this was ascribed to the presence of aom which scavenges the hydroxyl radicals as reported in existing literature 62 63 previous studies have reported that a short exposure time and an h2o2 concentration less than 2 mg l do not affect the viability of algal cells 64 65 moreover it has been proven that radical scavengers do not affect microalgal disintegration efficiency during ultrasonication 17 42 thus instead of chemical effects mechanical mechanisms are mainly responsible for the disintegration of microalgae cells during ultrasonication extracellular atp concentration was determined to complement the fcm results of non viable cells fig 1c shows the soluble atp concentration changes in microalgal suspensions treated with different ultrasonication powers for up to 20 min and the results showed a strong correlation r2 0 98 p 0 001 with the number of damaged cells in our observations soluble atp was considered a biomarker for the pattern shown by damaged cells during ultrasonication there is an additional cost of filtration and labor required for the continual measurement of soluble atp concentration and there could also be a risk of error due to sample contamination 66 67 the effects of ultrasonication power and time on the stability of atp are poorly reported in scientific literature hence further work into minimizing uncertainty and identifying the major error contributing parameters during ultrasonication could clarify the correlation between atp and ultrasonication 3 2 variation in aom during ultrasonication ultrasonication produces cavitation bubbles that damage cell structure and alter cell membrane permeability 12 resulting in the release of aom bulk parameters such as doc uv254 absorbance and suva were determined to obtain evidence of aom released upon treatment with different ultrasonication powers i e 0 039 0 08 0 164 and 0 32 w ml for 0 5 10 15 and 20 min see fig 2 both doc concentration and uv254 increased linearly with ultrasonication power and contact time doc concentrations were 2 2 4 6 7 1 and 9 7 mg l after 5 min and reached up to 5 2 8 9 14 2 and 16 8 mg l respectively after 20 min at ultrasonication powers of 0 039 0 08 0 164 and 0 32 w ml respectively in contrast to the doc and uv254 trends an insignificant difference was observed in suva upon ultrasonication see fig 2c anova p 0 05 this could be associated with the large number of destroyed microalgae cells which resulted in a decreased proportion of aromatic hydrocarbons in the aom it should be noted that the high suva value before ultrasonication treatment was due to the presence of inorganic nutrients such as nano3 in the medium which also absorb light at uv254 parafac modeling confirmed three component models see fig 3 in which component 1 c1 had maximum peaks at 280 310 nm ex em and was assigned as a tryptophan like component 10 32 68 69 the peak of component 2 i e c2 had a primary peak at 225 310 nm ex em and a secondary peak at 275 314 nm for tyrosine like components based on the literature 27 68 69 component 3 i e c3 also displayed two peaks at 245 400 and 365 400 nm ex em which were assigned to humic like components as reported in previous studies 32 68 70 all three extracted components closely matched the previous reports on fluorescence based studies of aom in different water samples and sufficiently explained the release of aom during ultrasonication maximum fluorescence intensity fmax of all three components showed an increasing trend with increasing ultrasonication intensity see fig 4 the relative abundance of components was in the order tryptophan like tyrosine like humic like these findings revealed that tryptophan like components were the main contributor to aom explained by the specific structure of tryptophan like substances that emitted more fluorescence than tyrosine like substances 71 pearson correlation showed that all three fluorescence components displayed a significantly high correlation r2 0 86 p 0 001 with both doc and uv254 in particular c1 i e tryptophan like components displayed a slightly higher correlation with doc and uv254 values see table s2 a previous study also reported a strong correlation between protein like components and doc in aom 72 however throughout the ultrasonication treatment the suva value did not show any correlation with the fluorescence components r2 0 37 protein like i e tryptophan and tyrosine like activity is often attributed to the hydrophilic fraction 73 increasing ultrasonication power and time results in relative enrichment of the c1 component associated with the leaching of intracellular aom substances which have been reported as protein like fluorescent molecules 74 75 these materials are composed of high organic nitrogen content which displays low suva values even for aromatic proteins 76 furthermore previous studies have reported that intracellular organic matter has a low doc to don ratio which has been associated with an abundance of nitrogen rich organic matter 75 3 3 changes in aom fraction as determined using sec ocd fig 5 illustrates the changes in the different size fractions of aom it should be noted that before sonication treatment i e at 0 min extremely low peaks of hs bb and lmw a and lmw n were detected originating from the culture media containing 1 mg l edta na2 a similar peak for edta was reported in a previous study 77 the concentration of each fraction consistently increased with ultrasonication power from 0 039 0 32 w ml and the increase rate was statistically significant anova p 0 05 when comparing the results at 20 min the bp e g polysaccharides and proteins concentration increased with increasing ultrasonication power after 20 min of treatment at 0 32 w ml the most abundant fraction was bp 30 followed by lmw n 21 and hs 19 while lmw n contained weakly uncharged hydrophilic components and hs had small fragments 57 in addition to the increasing trend shown by bps the uv signal peak also increased with ultrasonication power when observed under similar retention times of the oc peak see fig s5 this was supported by a previous study that demonstrated that the intracellular matrix of algae mostly contains bps such as proteins and amino acids 78 these findings suggest that nitrogen enriched organic matter such as proteins and small amino acids increased with increasing ultrasonication power the sec ocd analysis coupled with aom bulk parameters and eem parafac components was used to enhance the predictability of aom released upon ultrasonication for example all size fractions i e bp hs bb lmw n and lmw a showed strong correlations with aom bulk parameters e g doc and uv254 r2 0 88 p 0 001 see table s2 this could be supported by the consistently increasing trend of protein like components in bp and high amounts of lmw n and lmw a with increasing ultrasonication power when compared to the three fluorescent components identified via eem parafac modeling bp i e the most enriched fraction showed a stronger correlation with fluorescent protein like components c1 tryptophan like and c2 tyrosine like r2 0 90 p 0 001 see table s2 in addition these fluorescence components also displayed positive correlation with lmw n and lmw a r2 0 86 p 0 001 these findings indicated that c1 strongly represented the bp and lmw fractions likely owing to the presence of protein amino acids and were supported by the trend of uv signal peaks displayed by bp and lmw see fig s5 furthermore the hs and bb fractions correlated significantly r2 0 88 p 0 001 with c3 i e humic like fluorescence components these findings indicated that sec ocd analysis strongly supported the physicochemical characteristics of the three selected fluorescence components in aom released upon ultrasonication of the microalgae suspension 3 4 selecting fluorescence signatures for destroyed microalgae cells and related aom via pca the pca graph was plotted see fig 6 between the destroyed microalgae cell count and aom characteristics in order to evaluate its potential for use in predicting microalgal disintegration and concurrent aom excretion during ultrasonication principal component 1 pc1 and principal component 2 pc2 accounted for 77 96 and 14 05 of the total variance respectively most variables fell in the upper right quadrant i e positive loading of both pc 1 and pc 2 including all five fractions quantified using sec ocd i e bp hs bb lmw a and lmw n all three eem parafac components i e c1 tryptophan like c2 tyrosine like and c3 humic like uv254 and hix damaged cells doc atp spectral slope ratio sr asi and bix are shown in the lower right quadrant while the upper left quadrant contains suva and s275 294 nm hence pca showed that hix bix suva and s275 294 nm were not useful in the prediction of released aom and estimation of destroyed cells during ultrasonication however the concentration of microalgal disintegration was associated with atp uv254 asi and c1 variables however as mentioned in section 3 1 the use of atp is not feasible for real time on site tracking highlighting the importance of spectroscopic and fluorescence base descriptors unlike other absorption based indices asi displayed an increasing trend with ultrasonication power and time showing a strong correlation coefficient with destroyed microalgae cell count and bulk aom parameters r2 0 96 p 0 001 see table s2 asi has been successfully used to probe microbial activity in activated sludge during water treatment 79 but has never been utilized as a signature for microalgae disintegration the number of damaged cells had a significant positive correlation with all three fluorescence components i e tryptophan like c1 0 98 tyrosine like c2 0 84 and humic like c3 0 96 with p values 0 001 these components also showed statistically strong relationships r2 0 82 p 0 001 with doc see table s2 previous studies have also reported a strong correlation between protein like components and doc 72 c1 was spotted in high pc1 0 26 and low pc2 0 01 which could be related to the damaged cell count doc and uv254 absorbance when compared with other fluorescence components c1 exhibited a comparatively high correlation efficiency regardless of the ultrasonication power and treatment time moreover the c1 fmax value was significantly higher the fmax of c2 and c3 this greater contribution of c1 could be explained by its high fluorescence emission c1 is thus the most reliable descriptor for destroyed microalgae count as well as for changes in aom during the ultrasonication of microalgal biomass these new findings are significant because fluorescence based probing has never been used for microalgal disintegration so far despite its successful application to the in situ detection of cyanobacteria 80 eem parafac modeling requires a large set of eem samples thus its practical implementation might not be feasible for on site utilization to strengthen the practical applicability of our findings the maximum peaks at ex em 280 330 nm of c1 i e tryptophan like components were correlated with microalgal disintegration see fig 7a with the corresponding excitation emission wavelength in raw eem see fig 7b which were then correlated with the raw eem sample peak intensity at ex em 280 330 nm from microalgal disintegration see fig 7c all three relationships were significantly strong p 0 05 with an r2 score of 0 97 fig s6 presents the apparent changes in the raw eem of the microalgae samples treated with different ultrasonication powers at lower power and treatment time peaks a and b were more prominent and hence initially released into water and were similar to protein like fluorescence i e tryptophan like and tyrosine like fluorescence 79 81 as the ultrasonication power and treatment time increased humic like peaks c3 79 also appeared in the samples the tryptophan like peak in raw eem data was strongly correlated r2 0 98 p 0 05 with the destroyed cell count which was similar to the correlation between c1 identified via eem parafac and microalgal disintegration these results suggest that the ultrasonication potential of microalgal disintegration and the related release of organic matter could be predicted through online monitoring of the single eem peak i e ex em 280 310 nm identified from eem parafac modeling 3 5 implication and outlook water authorities worldwide are adopting novel strategies to improve the management of algal bloom events owing to their numerous adverse effects among other strategies ultrasonication is emerging and has a high potential for algal bloom removal without the use of any harmful chemicals hence it is essential to consider post ultrasonication water quality this study suggests strong potential spectroscopic descriptors to describe microalgal disintegration and changes in aom during ultrasonication treatment among the fluorescence moieties the tryptophan like component i e ex em 280 330 nm was the best surrogate for microalgal disintegration as well as for aom the fluorescence method is simple inexpensive fast chemical free and easy to develop into a portable fluorescence sensor for in situ monitoring of ultrasonication during algal bloom removal the real time signal of the tryptophan like component can be linked to operational conditions such as ultrasonication power and time microalgal disintegration count and the amount of aom excreted by which the ultrasonication treatment can be controlled in situ for targeted microalgae removal as well as to avoid extreme aom production the results of this study are however based on a single algal species therefore further research on a broader spectrum of algal species is necessary these results would not be limited to ultrasonication but may be expanded to many other treatment processes targeting algal bloom removal 4 conclusions this study comprehensively investigated the efficiency of ultrasonication on microalgal disintegration and related spectroscopic descriptors of aom pca revealed that among the adsorption based optical descriptors uv254 and asi were highly correlated with microalgae disintegration moreover among the three identified fluorescence components the tryptophan like components i e c1 showed pronounced fluorescence intensity and were highly correlated r2 0 98 with microalgal disintegration a c1 corresponding single fluorescence peak at 280 330 nm ex em in the raw eem was significantly correlated with microalgal disintegration r2 0 96 this revealed that spectroscopic descriptors such as uv254 asi and the single fluorescence peak at 280 330 nm ex em can be used as potential biomarkers for tracking microalgal disintegration as well as for variations in concurrent excreted aom among the descriptors identified fluorescence based c1 method is a more sensitive and advanced technique these probes can provide advantages to the operation of ultrasonication for algal bloom removal as well as the prediction of their influence on subsequent treatment technologies our findings are the first steps toward establishing a real time management technology during ultrasonication for microalgal disintegration and related aom production to ensure the applicability of spectroscopic disruptors follow up investigations comprising other treatment methods based on a broader spectrum of algal species are necessary to establish a strong

during the ultrasonication process graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords algal organic matter excitation emission matrix microalgae size exclusion chromatography ultrasonication 1 introduction significant problems associated with harmful algal blooms have been emerging because of climate change and artificial nutrient enrichment from anthropogenic activities 1 algal eutrophication releases significant amounts of algal organic matter aom which is composed mainly of proteins polysaccharides lipids and nucleic acids 2 aom can be categorized into extracellular organic matter i e the by products of algal metabolism excreted from living cells and intracellular organic matter i e materials released during cell autolysis 3 elevated aom content in water bodies is accompanied by well known taste and odor compounds such as geosmin and 2 methyl isoborneol as well as microcystins i e the most common group of cyanotoxins 4 5 aom also has low aromaticity and high dissolved organic nitrogen don content 6 conventional water treatment processes such as coagulation sedimentation filtration are thus not efficient on aom because of its hydrophilic nature 7 for example the polysaccharides in aom deteriorate the coagulation or flocculation performance owing to their ability to form stable hydrocolloid 2 the protein components of aom have surface activity and can interact with dissolved cations resulting in membrane fouling 8 aom has the potential to form a disinfection by product dbp upon chlorination owing to its high don content 9 11 to decrease the abundance of harmful algal blooms in water bodies various treatments such as coagulation clarification filtration flotation uv persulfate treatment photolysis ozone and chlorine treatment and algicide treatment have been developed which are complex expensive and may worsen the concentration of toxins in the water body 12 14 compared to these technologies ultrasonication has gained increasing attention for controlling algal blooms because it is environment friendly easy to operate and does not require additional chemicals 13 14 several studies have investigated the removal of algal blooms using ultrasonication mainly focusing on its influence on enhancing the removal of algae and the subsequent inhibition of algal growth 12 14 19 moreover ultrasonic pre treatment for the removal of microcystis aeruginosa via coagulation has been successfully demonstrated 20 ultrasonication of water accounts for compression sequences and rarefaction cycles that generate acoustic cavitation during this process countless bubbles collapse swiftly at a localized temperature as high as 5000 k and pressure up to 100 mpa while producing free radicals 12 17 hence ultrasonication can successfully lead to functional and structural damage in microalgae aom consists of extracellular and intracellular organic matter which is released into water and the high amount of don in intracellular organic matter can generate substantial quantities of dbps 12 21 as described above accurate characterization of the composition of aom is crucial for a deeper understanding particularly for maximizing the performance of ultrasonication treatment to reduce the adverse effects of aom pollution on aquatic ecosystems as well as for post sonication water treatment processes bulk parameters such as ultraviolet visible uv vis absorption coefficients and dissolved organic carbon doc have been widely used to monitor the fate of aom 7 22 23 however the majority of scientific literature has proposed that these parameters are not satisfactory for tracking the heterogeneous nature of aom 24 25 the fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem combined with parallel factor analysis i e eem parafac has emerged as a powerful tool owing to its high sensitivity rapid processing and easy to use methodology which can successfully categorize the bulk of fluorescent dissolved organic matter into its individual components 3 26 28 eem parafac has been previously applied for tracking phytoplankton 29 32 the quantification of cyanobacteria that contain phycocyanin 29 33 and the estimation of bloom formation 34 fluorescence has thus proven to be a valuable tool for on site detection and estimation of phytoplankton populations as well as their potential toxicity despite the increasingly widespread use of eem parafac few studies have used eem to characterize the fate of the aom released during ultrasonication 12 35 36 to the best of our knowledge this method has not yet been used upon the ultrasonication treatment of algal blooms in order to investigate fluorescence based descriptors for microalgal disintegration and related production of aom in this study the effectiveness of ultrasonication in microalgae disruption and associated organic matter was evaluated using spectroscopic and fluorescence indices the objectives of this study were 1 to investigate changes in different spectroscopic indices of aom and 2 to determine fluorescence surrogates for monitoring variations in aom and the calculation of microalgae count destroyed during ultrasonication to the best of our knowledge this is the first study to assess the systematic performance of spectroscopic descriptors for probing microalgal disintegration upon ultrasonication and to set a path for developing a real time monitoring technology for the removal of algal blooms 2 materials and methodology 2 1 materials in this study chlorella vulgaris was used for analyses as it is a common algal blooming species 21 37 the c vulgaris strain ag10002 was purchased from the korean culture type collection south korea and was grown in bg 11 medium as described in section 2 2 microalgae were ultrasonicated at 20 khz using a 750 w vibra cell ultrasonic processor vc750 sonics materials inc usa equipped with a horn tip 25 mm in diameter as well as a temperature probe the sytox green nucleic acid stain invitrogen life technologies grand island usa was used to stain microalgae cells and the cell viability was measured using flow cytometry standard ratp and bactiter glo promega madison wi usa were used to measure the calibration curve see fig s1 to convert the relative luminescence unit to adenosine triphosphate atp concentration and the atp concentration in ultrasonication samples respectively relative luminescence values were recorded using a luminometer glomax 20 20 promega immediately before and after each ultrasonication experiment approximately 1 ml of mixed liquor was centrifuged and the supernatant was used to determine the concentration of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 using pierce quantitative peroxide assay kits thermo scientific rockford il usa and a uv vis spectrophotometer dr5000 hach germany all chemical reagents used in this study were analytical grade unless specified otherwise 2 2 microalgae cultivation and sample preparation the stock culture of c vulgaris was prepared under growth conditions as described in our previous studies 38 40 microalgae were grown in 2 l reactors containing 1 6 l of autoclaved bg 11 medium aerated with a mixture of ambient air 90 and co2 10 at a flow rate of 45 ml min 1 under continuous mixing at 100 rpm using a magnetic stirrer the glass bottle reactor was incubated under continuous illumination with white fluorescent light of 5000 6000 lx at 25 c and light intensity was measured using an auto digital luxmeter victor 1010a for ultrasonication experiments microalgae in the stationary growth phase i e between 14 and 17 days of incubation 41 were collected via centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 10 min at room temperature washed three times with mineral bottled water and transferred into modified bg 11 medium see table s1 at an optical density od 680 nm of 0 3 cm 1 corresponding to an initial cell concentration of 2 6 106 cells ml the regular bg 11 medium was modified by eliminating the addition of citric acid and ferric ammonium citrate while nano3 addition was reduced by 50 these modifications were considered to minimize the influence of the medium components on the characterization of the released aom during ultrasonication 2 3 ultrasonication treatment ultrasonication experiments were conducted at different powers of 0 039 0 08 0 164 and 0 32 w ml and for each instance power was applied for 5 10 15 and 20 min microalgae suspension samples before ultrasonication i e at 0 min were used as controls the power range was chosen based on previous studies 15 18 42 joyce et al 2010 reported that a temperature rise of 18 30 c has no damaging effect on microalgae for up to 30 min 15 the temperature for ultrasonication was maintained at 22 2 c using an ice bath the sonicator probe was inserted 2 5 3 cm into the center of the microalgal suspension and each ultrasonication experiment was conducted twice the acoustic power entering the suspension was measured using calorimetry as described in previous studies 43 44 two hundred milliliters of water were continuously sonicated for 20 min at different amplitudes i e 20 40 60 80 and 100 temperature was recorded every 10 s starting at the ambient temperature this was carried out thrice for each amplitude and the equation below was used to calculate the ultrasonic power fig s2 shows the power output at different amplitudes w t t cp m where w is the power in watts t t is the slope of the regression curve t is the temperature in k t is time in seconds cp is the water heat capacity 4 18 j kg 1 k 1 and m is the mass of the water sample in kg 2 4 counting microalgae flow cytometry adenosine triphosphate and optical density to determine the number of intact and destructed microalgae cells flow cytometry fcm analysis was conducted using a partec cyflow cube 6 flow cytometer partec gmbh görlitz germany equipped with a 20 mw laser emitting at a wavelength of 488 nm the quantification of intact and destroyed microalgae cells was conducted as described in previous studies 45 46 the sytox green nucleic acid stain was used to stain the microalgae cells that had damaged cell membranes as well as their nucleic acid sytox green stock solution 100 μm was prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide and stored at 20 c in the dark the stock solution was diluted with milli q water to prepare the working solution 50 μm the cells were stained by adding 20 μl of the working solution to 0 98 ml of the microalgae sample in order to achieve a 1 μm concentration of sytox green the samples were incubated in darkness at 36 c for 10 min diluted 10 v v using milli q water and were subsequently injected into the flow cytometer all fcm data were processed using the fcs4 express cytometry software de novo software glendale ca usa the electronic gating application of the software was used to separate positive signals from microalgae cells and to exclude noise from non microalgal particles or instruments itself by control experiments see fig s3 the background noise region was briefly excluded from the microalgae cells region using filtrates of only modified bg 11 media and intact and temperature killed microalgae samples and all samples were filtered with 0 45 μm hydrophilic polyethersulfone syringe filters advantec toyo roshi kaisha ltd japan after staining sytox bound to the nucleic acids of destructed microalgae and produced green fluorescence at 530 nm but could not penetrate intact cells wherein chlorophyll auto fluorescence produced red fluorescence at 620 nm the flow cytometer detected green fluorescence from the fl1 channel i e 530 nm and red fluorescence from the fl3 channel i e 620 nm which represented the destroyed and intact microalgae cells respectively cellular atp is released into the extracellular environment through damaged cell membranes soluble atp concentration was determined to complement the results of damaged cells measured using fcm the soluble atp content was determined according to previous studies 47 briefly microalgae suspensions before and after ultrasonication were immediately filtered using a 0 1 μm polyethersulfone sterile syringe filter sartorius germany the atp reagent 100 μl was added to 100 μl of the filtered sample and incubated in the dark at 36 c for 2 min bactiter glo promega the relative luminescence values were recorded using a luminometer and converted to atp concentrations using the calibration curve see fig s1 microalgae samples were subjected to uv vis scanning immediately before and after ultrasonication from 300 to 800 nm at 2 nm intervals using a uv vis spectrophotometer dr5000 hach germany fig s4 shows the corresponding spectra the value at 680 nm i e od680 for each sample was used to estimate the concentration of microalgae 48 2 5 dissolved organic matter characteristics dissolved organic carbon uv vis spectroscopic descriptors fluorescence eem parafac and size exclusion chromatography prior to measuring water quality all samples were filtered with 0 45 μm hydrophilic polyethersulfone advantec toyo roshi kaisha ltd japan in order to avoid any undesirable adsorption onto the filter as well as carbon bleeding from the filter 49 uv vis spectra were obtained from 200 to 800 nm wavelength with a 1 cm quartz cuvette on a spectrophotometer dr 5000 hach usa and doc was determined using a total organic carbon analyzer toc v cpn shimadzu japan the specific uv absorbance suva value was calculated by normalizing 100 fold uv254 to the concentration of doc in the water sample and was used for the rough estimation of aom aromaticity the log transformation of the absorption spectra of two distinct slope regions such as the spectral slope i e s274 294 was calculated from the log transformation of the slope from 274 to 295 nm the spectral slope ratio sr was calculated as 274 294 nm divided by 350 400 nm which has been reported as an indicator of the molecular weight mw of organic matter 50 51 the absorbance slope index asi represents variation in the chromophores corresponding to the activated of aromatic groups 250 nm relative to carboxylic and aromatic groups e g 200 230 nm in organic matter 52 each measurement was performed thrice asi 0 56 a 250 a 272 a 220 a 230 prior to spectroscopic analysis all water samples were filtered 0 45 μm and diluted to a uv254 value of 0 05 in order to avoid the effect of the inner filter on fluorescence spectra 53 fluorescence spectra were measured in a three dimensional eem using a fluorescence spectrometer shimadzu rf 5301pc the emission em spectra were scanned in an area of 280 nm 550 nm at 1 nm wavelength intervals while the excitation ex spectra were scanned from 220 to 500 nm at intervals of 5 nm eem spectra of milli q water i e blank were subtracted from the eem samples and parafac modeling was conducted for all eem spectra samples collected both before and after ultrasonication of microalgae in total 71 fluorescence eem data arrays were subjected to parafac analysis using the domfluor toolbox 54 in matlab 9 8 r2020a mathworks natick ma usa after removing scattering from the eem spectra residual analysis and split half validation were applied to identify the correct number of components fmax refers to the maximum fluorescence intensity of individual components and raman unit equivalents were used to normalize the obtained fluorescence intensity 55 fluorescence based indices such as the biological index bix and the humification index hix were calculated from eem fluorescence the hix was estimated from the emission spectrum region at a wavelength of 435 480 nm divided by 300 345 nm at an excitation wavelength of 255 nm 50 56 bix was calculated from the ratio of the emission area under 380 430 nm at an excitation wavelength of 310 nm 50 size exclusion chromatography sec equipped with an uv and doc system along with an organic carbon detector ocd and ultraviolet detector uvd was employed to determine the mw characteristics of aom before and after sonication lc ocd model 8 system doc labor karlsruhe germany 57 these characteristics were classified into the following fractions 1 biopolymer bp 20 kda 2 humic like substances hs 1 kda 3 building blocks bb 300 500 da 4 low molecular weight acids lmw a 350 da and charged and 5 low molecular weight neutrals lmw n 350 da fig s5 presents the representative ocd and uvd chromatograms of aom both before and after ultrasonication treatment with their peaks indicating individual size fractions 2 6 statistical analysis all statistical analyses were performed using the origin pro 8 1 software package the performance of the ultrasonication treatment was validated using a one way anova at 95 confidence interval principal component analysis pca was performed on a set of data obtained from ultrasonication experiments such as destroyed cell counts measured via fcm soluble atp concentration bulk organic parameters e g doc and uv254 suva other absorption based descriptors e g s274 294 sr and asi fmax value of each intensity fluorescence indices e g hix and bix and mw fractions e g bp hs bb lmw n and lmw a in order to determine the pearson s correlation between aom descriptors and the destroyed microalgae count 3 results and discussion 3 1 microalgal disintegration it was speculated that the microalgal disintegration increased with increasing both ultrasonication powers 0 039 0 32 w ml and the treatment time at 5 min intervals for up to 20 min see fig 1a in this study a higher ultrasonic power i e 0 32 w ml was more efficient for microalgae disintegration this is because a high ultrasonic intensity causes intense cavitation and accelerated sonochemical effects 42 43 statistically increasing ultrasonication power up to 10 min showed the highest correlation coefficient with destroyed cells r2 0 90 p 0 05 for example the destructed cell count reached up to 23 36 52 and 66 with ultrasonication powers of 0 039 0 08 0 164 and 0 32 w ml respectively transferred for 10 min however there was no significant difference in the count of damaged cells with any further increase in time i e above 10 min this can be considered the optimized ultrasonication time for this study this trend of microalgal disintegration at different ultrasonication powers and times is in accordance with that in previous studies 15 18 primary microalgal disintegration during ultrasonication has been associated with mechanical rupture of the cell membrane and collapse of gas vesicles due to ultrasonic transient cavitation 12 58 acoustic cavitation can also generate h2o2 59 the mutual contribution of these sonolysis and hydroxyl radicals can alter cell membrane permeability which plays a role in further damaging intracellular organelles from hydroxyl radicals 60 61 h2o2 generation was determined in this study see fig 1b h2o2 is produced as a result of the decomposition of water h2o during sonication due to cavitation collapse during 15 min of ultrasonication h2o2 content was increased to 3 7 8 3 18 and 18 9 μmol l for different power values of 0 039 0 08 0 164 and 0 32 w ml respectively however a slight decrease of 9 and 12 in h2o2 generation was observed at 0 164 and 0 32 w ml respectively when the ultrasonication time was increased from 15 to 20 min this was ascribed to the presence of aom which scavenges the hydroxyl radicals as reported in existing literature 62 63 previous studies have reported that a short exposure time and an h2o2 concentration less than 2 mg l do not affect the viability of algal cells 64 65 moreover it has been proven that radical scavengers do not affect microalgal disintegration efficiency during ultrasonication 17 42 thus instead of chemical effects mechanical mechanisms are mainly responsible for the disintegration of microalgae cells during ultrasonication extracellular atp concentration was determined to complement the fcm results of non viable cells fig 1c shows the soluble atp concentration changes in microalgal suspensions treated with different ultrasonication powers for up to 20 min and the results showed a strong correlation r2 0 98 p 0 001 with the number of damaged cells in our observations soluble atp was considered a biomarker for the pattern shown by damaged cells during ultrasonication there is an additional cost of filtration and labor required for the continual measurement of soluble atp concentration and there could also be a risk of error due to sample contamination 66 67 the effects of ultrasonication power and time on the stability of atp are poorly reported in scientific literature hence further work into minimizing uncertainty and identifying the major error contributing parameters during ultrasonication could clarify the correlation between atp and ultrasonication 3 2 variation in aom during ultrasonication ultrasonication produces cavitation bubbles that damage cell structure and alter cell membrane permeability 12 resulting in the release of aom bulk parameters such as doc uv254 absorbance and suva were determined to obtain evidence of aom released upon treatment with different ultrasonication powers i e 0 039 0 08 0 164 and 0 32 w ml for 0 5 10 15 and 20 min see fig 2 both doc concentration and uv254 increased linearly with ultrasonication power and contact time doc concentrations were 2 2 4 6 7 1 and 9 7 mg l after 5 min and reached up to 5 2 8 9 14 2 and 16 8 mg l respectively after 20 min at ultrasonication powers of 0 039 0 08 0 164 and 0 32 w ml respectively in contrast to the doc and uv254 trends an insignificant difference was observed in suva upon ultrasonication see fig 2c anova p 0 05 this could be associated with the large number of destroyed microalgae cells which resulted in a decreased proportion of aromatic hydrocarbons in the aom it should be noted that the high suva value before ultrasonication treatment was due to the presence of inorganic nutrients such as nano3 in the medium which also absorb light at uv254 parafac modeling confirmed three component models see fig 3 in which component 1 c1 had maximum peaks at 280 310 nm ex em and was assigned as a tryptophan like component 10 32 68 69 the peak of component 2 i e c2 had a primary peak at 225 310 nm ex em and a secondary peak at 275 314 nm for tyrosine like components based on the literature 27 68 69 component 3 i e c3 also displayed two peaks at 245 400 and 365 400 nm ex em which were assigned to humic like components as reported in previous studies 32 68 70 all three extracted components closely matched the previous reports on fluorescence based studies of aom in different water samples and sufficiently explained the release of aom during ultrasonication maximum fluorescence intensity fmax of all three components showed an increasing trend with increasing ultrasonication intensity see fig 4 the relative abundance of components was in the order tryptophan like tyrosine like humic like these findings revealed that tryptophan like components were the main contributor to aom explained by the specific structure of tryptophan like substances that emitted more fluorescence than tyrosine like substances 71 pearson correlation showed that all three fluorescence components displayed a significantly high correlation r2 0 86 p 0 001 with both doc and uv254 in particular c1 i e tryptophan like components displayed a slightly higher correlation with doc and uv254 values see table s2 a previous study also reported a strong correlation between protein like components and doc in aom 72 however throughout the ultrasonication treatment the suva value did not show any correlation with the fluorescence components r2 0 37 protein like i e tryptophan and tyrosine like activity is often attributed to the hydrophilic fraction 73 increasing ultrasonication power and time results in relative enrichment of the c1 component associated with the leaching of intracellular aom substances which have been reported as protein like fluorescent molecules 74 75 these materials are composed of high organic nitrogen content which displays low suva values even for aromatic proteins 76 furthermore previous studies have reported that intracellular organic matter has a low doc to don ratio which has been associated with an abundance of nitrogen rich organic matter 75 3 3 changes in aom fraction as determined using sec ocd fig 5 illustrates the changes in the different size fractions of aom it should be noted that before sonication treatment i e at 0 min extremely low peaks of hs bb and lmw a and lmw n were detected originating from the culture media containing 1 mg l edta na2 a similar peak for edta was reported in a previous study 77 the concentration of each fraction consistently increased with ultrasonication power from 0 039 0 32 w ml and the increase rate was statistically significant anova p 0 05 when comparing the results at 20 min the bp e g polysaccharides and proteins concentration increased with increasing ultrasonication power after 20 min of treatment at 0 32 w ml the most abundant fraction was bp 30 followed by lmw n 21 and hs 19 while lmw n contained weakly uncharged hydrophilic components and hs had small fragments 57 in addition to the increasing trend shown by bps the uv signal peak also increased with ultrasonication power when observed under similar retention times of the oc peak see fig s5 this was supported by a previous study that demonstrated that the intracellular matrix of algae mostly contains bps such as proteins and amino acids 78 these findings suggest that nitrogen enriched organic matter such as proteins and small amino acids increased with increasing ultrasonication power the sec ocd analysis coupled with aom bulk parameters and eem parafac components was used to enhance the predictability of aom released upon ultrasonication for example all size fractions i e bp hs bb lmw n and lmw a showed strong correlations with aom bulk parameters e g doc and uv254 r2 0 88 p 0 001 see table s2 this could be supported by the consistently increasing trend of protein like components in bp and high amounts of lmw n and lmw a with increasing ultrasonication power when compared to the three fluorescent components identified via eem parafac modeling bp i e the most enriched fraction showed a stronger correlation with fluorescent protein like components c1 tryptophan like and c2 tyrosine like r2 0 90 p 0 001 see table s2 in addition these fluorescence components also displayed positive correlation with lmw n and lmw a r2 0 86 p 0 001 these findings indicated that c1 strongly represented the bp and lmw fractions likely owing to the presence of protein amino acids and were supported by the trend of uv signal peaks displayed by bp and lmw see fig s5 furthermore the hs and bb fractions correlated significantly r2 0 88 p 0 001 with c3 i e humic like fluorescence components these findings indicated that sec ocd analysis strongly supported the physicochemical characteristics of the three selected fluorescence components in aom released upon ultrasonication of the microalgae suspension 3 4 selecting fluorescence signatures for destroyed microalgae cells and related aom via pca the pca graph was plotted see fig 6 between the destroyed microalgae cell count and aom characteristics in order to evaluate its potential for use in predicting microalgal disintegration and concurrent aom excretion during ultrasonication principal component 1 pc1 and principal component 2 pc2 accounted for 77 96 and 14 05 of the total variance respectively most variables fell in the upper right quadrant i e positive loading of both pc 1 and pc 2 including all five fractions quantified using sec ocd i e bp hs bb lmw a and lmw n all three eem parafac components i e c1 tryptophan like c2 tyrosine like and c3 humic like uv254 and hix damaged cells doc atp spectral slope ratio sr asi and bix are shown in the lower right quadrant while the upper left quadrant contains suva and s275 294 nm hence pca showed that hix bix suva and s275 294 nm were not useful in the prediction of released aom and estimation of destroyed cells during ultrasonication however the concentration of microalgal disintegration was associated with atp uv254 asi and c1 variables however as mentioned in section 3 1 the use of atp is not feasible for real time on site tracking highlighting the importance of spectroscopic and fluorescence base descriptors unlike other absorption based indices asi displayed an increasing trend with ultrasonication power and time showing a strong correlation coefficient with destroyed microalgae cell count and bulk aom parameters r2 0 96 p 0 001 see table s2 asi has been successfully used to probe microbial activity in activated sludge during water treatment 79 but has never been utilized as a signature for microalgae disintegration the number of damaged cells had a significant positive correlation with all three fluorescence components i e tryptophan like c1 0 98 tyrosine like c2 0 84 and humic like c3 0 96 with p values 0 001 these components also showed statistically strong relationships r2 0 82 p 0 001 with doc see table s2 previous studies have also reported a strong correlation between protein like components and doc 72 c1 was spotted in high pc1 0 26 and low pc2 0 01 which could be related to the damaged cell count doc and uv254 absorbance when compared with other fluorescence components c1 exhibited a comparatively high correlation efficiency regardless of the ultrasonication power and treatment time moreover the c1 fmax value was significantly higher the fmax of c2 and c3 this greater contribution of c1 could be explained by its high fluorescence emission c1 is thus the most reliable descriptor for destroyed microalgae count as well as for changes in aom during the ultrasonication of microalgal biomass these new findings are significant because fluorescence based probing has never been used for microalgal disintegration so far despite its successful application to the in situ detection of cyanobacteria 80 eem parafac modeling requires a large set of eem samples thus its practical implementation might not be feasible for on site utilization to strengthen the practical applicability of our findings the maximum peaks at ex em 280 330 nm of c1 i e tryptophan like components were correlated with microalgal disintegration see fig 7a with the corresponding excitation emission wavelength in raw eem see fig 7b which were then correlated with the raw eem sample peak intensity at ex em 280 330 nm from microalgal disintegration see fig 7c all three relationships were significantly strong p 0 05 with an r2 score of 0 97 fig s6 presents the apparent changes in the raw eem of the microalgae samples treated with different ultrasonication powers at lower power and treatment time peaks a and b were more prominent and hence initially released into water and were similar to protein like fluorescence i e tryptophan like and tyrosine like fluorescence 79 81 as the ultrasonication power and treatment time increased humic like peaks c3 79 also appeared in the samples the tryptophan like peak in raw eem data was strongly correlated r2 0 98 p 0 05 with the destroyed cell count which was similar to the correlation between c1 identified via eem parafac and microalgal disintegration these results suggest that the ultrasonication potential of microalgal disintegration and the related release of organic matter could be predicted through online monitoring of the single eem peak i e ex em 280 310 nm identified from eem parafac modeling 3 5 implication and outlook water authorities worldwide are adopting novel strategies to improve the management of algal bloom events owing to their numerous adverse effects among other strategies ultrasonication is emerging and has a high potential for algal bloom removal without the use of any harmful chemicals hence it is essential to consider post ultrasonication water quality this study suggests strong potential spectroscopic descriptors to describe microalgal disintegration and changes in aom during ultrasonication treatment among the fluorescence moieties the tryptophan like component i e ex em 280 330 nm was the best surrogate for microalgal disintegration as well as for aom the fluorescence method is simple inexpensive fast chemical free and easy to develop into a portable fluorescence sensor for in situ monitoring of ultrasonication during algal bloom removal the real time signal of the tryptophan like component can be linked to operational conditions such as ultrasonication power and time microalgal disintegration count and the amount of aom excreted by which the ultrasonication treatment can be controlled in situ for targeted microalgae removal as well as to avoid extreme aom production the results of this study are however based on a single algal species therefore further research on a broader spectrum of algal species is necessary these results would not be limited to ultrasonication but may be expanded to many other treatment processes targeting algal bloom removal 4 conclusions this study comprehensively investigated the efficiency of ultrasonication on microalgal disintegration and related spectroscopic descriptors of aom pca revealed that among the adsorption based optical descriptors uv254 and asi were highly correlated with microalgae disintegration moreover among the three identified fluorescence components the tryptophan like components i e c1 showed pronounced fluorescence intensity and were highly correlated r2 0 98 with microalgal disintegration a c1 corresponding single fluorescence peak at 280 330 nm ex em in the raw eem was significantly correlated with microalgal disintegration r2 0 96 this revealed that spectroscopic descriptors such as uv254 asi and the single fluorescence peak at 280 330 nm ex em can be used as potential biomarkers for tracking microalgal disintegration as well as for variations in concurrent excreted aom among the descriptors identified fluorescence based c1 method is a more sensitive and advanced technique these probes can provide advantages to the operation of ultrasonication for algal bloom removal as well as the prediction of their influence on subsequent treatment technologies our findings are the first steps toward establishing a real time management technology during ultrasonication for microalgal disintegration and related aom production to ensure the applicability of spectroscopic disruptors follow up investigations comprising other treatment methods based on a broader spectrum of algal species are necessary to establish a strong

pyrrolidone nmp 12 2 2 84 wt spun hf membrane p l w2 has been shown to reveal the most desirable membrane characteristics for dcmd including comparable porosity ε 74 2 0 4 superior liquid entry pressure lep 3 05 bar and robust mechanical properties the p l w2 membrane also exhibited enhanced water flux energy efficiency and anti wetting ability in comparison with the neat pvdf hf membrane with advantage of easy implement the concept of adoption of additives mixture provides a novel platform to customize desirable pvdf hf membranes with enhanced dcmd performance keywords small molecular weight additive polyvinylidene fluoride hollow fiber membrane direct contact membrane distillation high salinity brine 1 introduction direct contact membrane distillation dcmd can utilize clean energy or waste heat to treat high salinity challenging water and it has been considered as a promising and efficient process within the water energy nexus 1 4 in a typical dcmd hot stream and cold water flow along the two surfaces of a microporous hydrophobic membrane that functions as a medium for the vapor transfer even though the membrane acts only as a barrier to avoid the contact between the two water streams and it does not contribute to the selectivity in dcmd the properties of the membrane including structure raw material and configuration all have a significant role in the dcmd performance 3 5 6 based on the previous literature a desirable dcmd membrane should satisfy several specific characteristics such as low thermal conductivity optimum membrane thickness desirable pore size and pore size distribution and high porosity both bulk porosity and effective porosity surface hydrophobicity and degrees of pores interconnectivity good chemical resistance thermal stability and physical robustness 7 9 an ideal dcmd membrane should also be accompanied with high water flux long term structure robustness and high energy efficiency ee despite enormous research interests into dcmd membrane properties over the past decade there is plenty of room for further advancement particularly with the widely employed pvdf hf membrane the investigation and engineering regarding its overall performance and viability for water treatment are still badly required 3 8 10 11 porous pvdf hf membranes are usually prepared via a non solvent induced phase separation nips method the introduction of suitable additives to dope solution is a simple and efficient strategy to enhance dcmd performance by tuning the membrane structure in general the use of additives can either change the thermodynamic state of the casting solution to shift the liquid liquid demixing and or modify the dope viscosity to alter the mass exchange rate between non solvent and solvent the structure and morphology of the pvdf membrane are highly determined by the trade off between the thermal dynamic effect and the kinetic effect the commonly used additives include high molecular weight mw additives including polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp 12 13 polyvinyl alcohol pva 14 and poly ethylene glycol peg 15 and small mw additives lithium chloride licl 16 18 lithium perchlorate liclo4 19 ethylene glycol eg alcohols 20 glycerol 2 17 21 22 and water h2o 18 20 21 23 it has been found that the high mw additives tended to remain in the membrane matrix which may reduce the membrane hydrophobicity 13 18 21 the addition of high mw additives generally accelerated the mass exchange rate and resulted in the formation of macrovoids the existence of macrovoids under the skin layer can intensify the phenomenon of membrane wetting and thus resulted in a significant detriment of salt rejection in dcmd 7 24 in contrast to high mw additive the small mw one could be lightly leached out during the membrane formation process and the following post treating procedure 13 the hydrophobicity of the membrane was able to maintain and even increase due to the improved surface roughness 25 the use of licl has been extensively reported in the previous literature 16 18 26 28 licl could dramatically augment the polymer solution viscosity due to the complex interactions between licl and the solvent and the macromolecular fluctuating networks created by li and the electron donor group of pvdf 16 however most of the results were lack of consistency and there is still no report on the use of additives for a desirable dcmd membrane for example the addition of licl was found effective in reducing the amount of macrovoids and improve the mechanical stability of the pvdf membrane 17 26 nevertheless several studies also reported that the membrane pore size could be enlarged as the addition of licl which resulted in reduced strength of the resultant membrane 16 18 27 28 h2o and eg are commonly used small mw non solvents for pvdf membrane fabrication as well because the water pvdf interaction was relatively weak the addition of h2o to the polymer solution accelerated the macrovoids formation in the membrane matrix 20 23 khayet et al reported the influence of h2o in the pvdf solution on the properties of the resultant membrane 23 the results showed that both the membrane porosity and pore size of the membranes increased with the water content in the pvdf dope the pvdf water membrane showed an exponentially increased water flux in vacuum membrane distillation vmd li et al 21 drew a similar conclusion that the introduction of water into the pvdf dope drastically improved the permeate flux similar studies have been performed by using eg as the additive for the pvdf membrane wang et al 25 reported a pvdf based hf membrane for dcmd application with eg as the additive the pvdf eg membrane possessed comparable dcmd performance with the commercially available pvdf hf membranes khayet et al 29 revealed eg concentration effects on the vmd performance of the pvdf membrane mokhtar et al 13 fabricated the pvdf membranes with pvp and eg compared to pvp the incorporation of eg avoided the adverse effect on the membrane hydrophobicity and enhanced both water flux and salt rejection in md besides the use of single small mw additive the mixture of the additives was also formulated to fabricate pvdf membranes such as licl water 18 licl 1 propanol 18 licl eg 30 and licl peg 31 as a general rule the three small mw additives licl water and eg showed different advantages in the engineering of a desirable pvdf membrane for dcmd 1 licl can eliminate the formation of macrovoids and cure the surface defects which improved both salt rejection and mechanical stability 2 the incorporation of water promoted the permeate flux through the significant increase in pore size 3 the use of eg could narrow the pore size distribution and enhance the anti wetting ability of the membrane by shrinking the pore size and thus achieved long term operating stability therefore it is technically feasible to obtain a pvdf hf membrane with all the desirable properties for particular use in dcmd by formulating the pvdf dope solution with multiple components of small mw additives the synergism between small mw additives might well combine their respective advantage leading to a much improved dcmd performance despite the fact that a couple of previous literature have revealed that the use of small mw additive mixtures possessed high potentials in fabricating pvdf hf membranes 30 32 there were still rare reports focusing on the engineering of a desirable pvdf membrane for the particular use in dcmd especially the treatment of the impaired water with a relatively high salinity 70 000 mg l was seldom considered in the evaluation of a specific pvdf membrane for dcmd in this study pvdf hf membranes were engineered with all the desirable dcmd properties for the treatment of a 100 000 mg l brine solution three different small mw additives licl h2o and eg and their mixtures were used to fabricate the pvdf hf membranes the synergetic effects of small mw additives on characteristics of the pvdf hf membrane and the obtained dcmd performance were all explored the result of this study is expected to provide a guideline for the selection of small mw additives to design high performance pvdf hf membranes for particular use in dcmd 2 experimental 2 1 materials the commercial pvdf resin model kynar hsv 900 was supplied by arkema inc the chemicals including n methyl 2 pyrrolidone nmp 99 9 lithium chloride licl 99 isopropanol ipa 98 5 and ethylene glycol eg 99 9 were all bought from sigma aldrich for the fabrication or characterization of hf membranes sodium chloride nacl 99 8 and pure kerosene were acquired from merck and sunnyside respectively ultra pure water was attained from a thermo scientific barnstead genpure pro water purification system 2 2 dope preparation and hf membrane fabrication the polymer powder was first dried in a vacuum oven at 70 c for a day the powder was then dissolved in nmp with the addition of different types of small mw additives the obtained homogeneous dope was degassed for another 12 h at 25 c the rheological properties of the dope solutions were measured using a physica mcr301 rheometer equipped with a coaxial cylinder anton paar germany the shear rate was 7 3 s 1 the dope formulas and the spinning conditions for membrane fabrication are tabulated in tables 1 and 2 respectively 2 3 characterization 2 3 1 membrane morphology the hf membrane morphologies including cross sectional outer and inner surface were examined by an fei quanta 200 3d fib sem system the membrane samples for cross section observation were immersed and fractured in liquid nitrogen to eliminate physical deformation all of the samples were deposited with a thin platinum layer using a metal coater jeol jfc 1300 japan 2 3 2 overall porosity maximum pore size mean pore size and effective porosity the dried membrane sample was first weighted in the air by an accurate analytical balance mettler toledo model xpe205 the sample was soaked in liquid kerosene for 120 h to be thoroughly wetted the membrane was then taken out from the kerosene and the residual solvent was wiped off carefully the wet membrane was weighted again the overall porosity ε can be estimated by eq 1 1 ε 4 w 2 w 1 πl od 2 id 2 ρ k where w 1 g is the weight of the dry membrane w 2 g is the weight of the wet membrane l m is the length of the hf membrane od and id m are the outer and inner diameters of the hf membrane respectively ρ k is the density of kerosene 0 82 g cm3 five tests for one sample were made to guarantee the accuracy of the result the maximum pore size of the hf membrane was obtained from the bubble point method described in the standard astm f316 33 35 briefly a single hf membrane was potted with epoxy resin in a 5 cm transparent tube isopropanol was filled in the shell side of the hf membrane for 24 h nitrogen was charged into the lumen of the hf membrane to replace the isopropanol that fully occupied in the membrane matrix a backpressure regulator was installed to adjust the pressure of nitrogen when the first bubble was observed the associated pressure was determined as the bubble point pressure the maximum pore size follows the laplace equation 2 d m 4 σ p cos θ where δp pa is the transmembrane pressure difference σ n m is the surface tension and θ the contact angle between the liquid and membrane surface the mean pore size and effective porosity were evaluated by a volume displacement based gas permeation experiment 16 29 36 the gas permeation experiments procedures have been detailed elsewhere 37 the membrane module was first assembled using two pieces of hf membranes ultrapure nitrogen was introduced to the lumen of the hf membrane and the trans membrane pressure was regulated through the backpressure regulator the gas flow lasted for at least 5 min to reach a steady state in which the pressure differential was stable across the membrane during the permeation measurement the volumetric gas flow rate was estimated with a digital flow meter aalborg mass flow controller under various feed pressures the vapor through a dcmd hf membrane could be assumed to diffusive flow and viscous flow as follow 38 3 j ε lrt d p 2 32 μ p d p 3 8 r t π m w where j is the gas permeance r j kg k is the gas constant t k is temperature d p m is the mean pore diameter μ is gas viscosity pa s p pa is transmembrane pressure difference and mw g mol is the feed gas molecular weight the eq 3 could be rearranged as follow 4 j δp s o p i o the slope

angle measurement of hf membranes external surface was performed at room temperature using a tensiometer sigma 701 ksv instruments ltd usa ten tests for per sample was conducted to guarantee the result accuracy 2 3 4 lep measurement fig 1 is the schematic illustration of self assembled apparatus for lep test the membrane module was made of 10 pieces of hf membranes and the effective length was 16 cm one end of the hf membrane module was connected with a back pressure transducer bpt 0 250 psig swagelok and the other end was introduced to a 3 5 wt nacl brine during the lep measurement the whole membrane module was first immersed in di water tank the feed nacl brine was then injected into the lumen side of the hf membranes via the isco syringe pump the feed pressure augmented with a step of 0 05 bar and each feed pressure was kept about 10 mins the conductivity of the di water was measured with a tds electrical conductivity meter model hatch 40d usa the lep was recorded as the pressure observed when the electrical conductivity in the water beaker was sharply increased 2 3 5 mechanical properties the uniaxial tensile test method was utilized to test the mechanical characteristics of the hf membrane the maximum tensile stress young s modulus and elongation at break were all tested by mts criterion model 44 the membrane sample was clamped with a gauge length of 50 mm and the measurement was conducted at a speed of 50 mm min the final recorded mechanical magnitude for one sample was averaged from at least ten tests 2 4 dcmd experiment fig 2 schematically illustrated the apparatus for the dcmd experiment in this study the membrane module was made of 10 pieces of hf membranes and the effective length was 16 cm in the dcmd process 100 000 mg l nacl and di water were circulated along with the shell side and lumen of hf membrane with a linear velocity of 2 0 m s and 1 0 m s respectively the feed and cold streams maintained at 60 c and 20 c respectively the inlet and outlet temperatures of the feed solution and the permeate water were all recorded with four temperature transducers the collected was weighted with a digital scale equipped with a data acquisition system the conductivity of permeate was measured by a conductivity meter the energy efficiency ee was evaluated by taking both the effective heat for water evaporation q w and the undesirable heat loss q c into consideration and the calculation was demonstrated using the following equation 7 ee q w q w q c a o j w λ w v p c p t p out t p in where a o m2 is the hot stream

heat capacity of the permeate solution and t p in k and t p out k are temperatures in inlet and outlet of cold stream k respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of single small mw additive the single small mw additives including licl water and eg were used to fabricate the pvdf hf membrane as listed in table 1 the concentration of pvdf was 12 wt and it was 4 wt 4 wt and 8 wt for licl water and eg respectively the selected amount of additives in the pvdf solution were determined from the water tolerance and viscosity of the dope solution referred from the previous literature 7 20 23 25 30 39 detailly the pvdf solutions with additives were selected close to their critical cloud point for obtaining desirable dcmd performance as recommended in previous work 39 the characteristics of the pvdf hf membranes with different additives including dimensions porosity overall porosity and effective porosity pore size surface hydrophobicity and lep are listed in table 3 the p l membrane was much less porous than the p o membrane as indicated by the reduced overall porosity and effective porosity of 56 7 0 9 and 642 m 1 respectively this result is different from the previous report that the membrane porosity increased when licl was incorporated into the polymer solution 16 27 it has been widely reported that the pore forming reagent of licl was able to induce a quick liquid liquid demixing because the decrease in thermodynamic miscibility thermodynamic effect the phase inversion was also delayed as the result of viscosity enhancement kinetic effect 16 18 26 27 besides the concentration of licl the factors of pvdf molecular weight pvdf concentration and the properties of solvent all affected the thermodynamic miscibility and viscosity of the dope solution in this study kynar hsv 900 pvdf was used as an ultra high molecular weight polymer among the commonly used commercially available pvdf polymer resins 40 furthermore the interaction between li ion and nmp was also proved to be stronger than the others 27 as a result the introduced small amount of licl considerably increased the dope viscosity it shows in fig 3 that the viscosity of pvdf licl eg nmp 12 2 4 82 and pvdf licl h2o nmp 12 1 3 84 reached up to 21 850 cp and 21 243 cp respectively which was much higher than the viscosity of pvdf nmp 12 88 it seems that the hf membrane structure was mainly affected by the kinetic effect but less from the thermodynamic effect as listed in table 3 the lep of the p l membrane was 5 05 bar which was owing to the decreased pore dimension and elimination of macro voids in the membrane matrix the incorporation of eg increased the overall porosity and effective porosity of the pvdf hf membrane to 80 2 0 6 and 5445 7 m 1 respectively the p e membrane also exhibited enhanced hydrophobicity and the contact angle was improved to 105 6 0 1 from 87 4 0 4 of the p o membrane this can be explained by the improved membrane surface roughness induced by the high effective porosity on the p e membrane surface 39 table 3 also listed that the p e membrane showed a relatively narrow pore diameter distribution with the mean pore size of 0 17 μm and the maximum pore size of 0 21 μm in contrast to 0 08 μm and 0 27 μm of the p o membrane the lep of the p e membrane was 1 8 bars which indicated an enhanced anti wetting ability because of the improved both membrane hydrophobicity and the narrower pore size distribution the use of water as the additive was more complex than licl and eg similar to licl the incorporation of water raised the polymer solution viscosity the presence of water also deteriorated the thermodynamic stability and impeded the rheological characteristics of the pvdf solution the influence of water on polymer solution can also be explained by the solubility parameter difference it is obvious in table 4 that pvdf water showed a more significant solubility parameter difference than pvdf eg which demonstrated a faster dope precipitation rate with water as the additive compared to that with eg 20 41 it shows in table 3 that the p w hf membrane possesses the highest overall porosity which reached up to 81 3 0 7 the biggest maximum pore size and the lowest lep among all the spun hf membranes the morphologies of the pvdf hf membranes were also examined and the results are demonstrated in fig 4 the use of small mw additive remarkably altered the structure of the membrane which includes membrane dimension amount and size of the macrovoids percentage of the spongy like structure membrane thickness roughness of the skin surface and pore size of the inner surface it shows in fig 4 that significant amounts of pyriform like macrovoids are observed at the cross sectional of the p o membrane that possessed a dense and smooth outer surface and a highly porous inner surface however with the addition of licl the p l membrane showed a dramatically different structure the loading of licl effectively suppressed the formation of macrovoids and the p l membrane showed a fully sponge like asymmetric structure in addition the surface morphology at the two sides of the p l membrane was changed compared to the p o membrane the p l membrane comprised a less uniform and porous inner surface and a smoother outer surface with small pores formed the p l membrane also exhibits a much denser outer layer compared to the p o membrane by comparing the cross sectional morphologies of p w to p o it was found that the amount of macrovoids at the cross section increased when water was incorporated this should be resulted from the weak interaction between water and pvdf in the phase inversion process 18 20 44 the morphology is consistent with the results in table 3 that the overall porosity mean pore size and maximum pore size all increased and the lep decreased when water was used as the additive which indicated that the accelerated thermodynamic immiscibility plays a more important role than the kinetic effect from the increased dope viscosity in the membrane formation process the addition of water primarily works as a de mixing enhancer that boosted the liquid liquid phase separation and resulted in the formation of pyriform like macrovoids the p e membrane comprised a porous sponge like inner layer and a porous outer layer which contains numerous pyriform like macrovoids the inner layer thickness was almost the same with the finger like outer layer the formation of sponge like inner layer was attributed to the delayed phase inversion process caused by the presence of enriched solvent in the bore fluid in addition the p e membrane showed a rougher and thinner outer surface than the p o membrane which is in well accordance with the previous study 25 in the membrane formation process the semi crystalline pvdf undergoes both liquid liquid de mixing and crystallization liquid solid de mixing behaviors the dope solution with different additives experienced distinguished composition paths during the membrane formation process as a strong non solvent the use of water promoted the instantaneous liquid liquid de mixing which suppressed the pvdf molecules interaction and resulted in high bulk porosity and large maximum pore size the addition of eg has less influence on the apparent viscosity of the pvdf solution but helped to lessen the affinity of the dope to water 45 thus the solvent exchange rate was decelerated which resulted in the formation of highly porous and roughness outer surface the use of licl was effective to slow down the phase separation rate and led the obtained membrane showing a fully sponge like structure to fabricate a porous pvdf hf membrane with specific membrane structure for dcmd application the mixture of small mw additives was formulated for pvdf membrane fabrication in the next section 3 2 comparison study of additive mixtures the pvdf dope viscosity with different additive mixtures was listed in fig 3 the mixture with licl showed obviously increased viscosity compared to the others the viscosity of the p w e dope solution was 18 572 cp which is slightly higher than the p e dope solution but lower than the p w dope the results of membrane properties were listed in table 3 the bulk porosity of the p o membrane was 64 4 and it increased to the range of 70 to 82 for the membranes with the additive mixtures it is obvious that the use of the mixed additives enhanced the bulk porosity the pvdf membrane the membrane with the additive mixtures of licl eg and licl water possessed higher bulk porosity and effective surface porosity than the membrane with single licl as the additive additionally the porosity of the pvdf hf membrane increased with the increased amount of water in the additive mixture of licl water the formulation of small mw additive mixtures can effectively tailor the membrane structure including porosity pore size hydrophobicity and lep similar to the use of single additive the membrane pore size reduced with the rise of licl concentration corresponding to an increased lep the addition of eg and water increased the membrane s effective porosity and pore size respectively fig 5 shows that the sem images of the p e w hf membrane was made of the finger like macrovoids stretched from almost the middle to outer surface with the addition of eg and water the water in the coagulant bath diffused faster into the nascent polymer matrix and formed a polymer lean phase the nucleation growth of the polymer lean phase resulted in pyriform like macrovoids for the membrane with licl eg as the additive mixture as shown in fig 5 the formation of large macrovoids was effectively suppressed along the cross section of the membrane which was attributed to the increased dope viscosity because of licl the augmented viscosity of polymer solution caused a delayed liquid liquid de mixing or spinodal composition and thus the intrusion of water into the nascent polymer matrix was hindered 7 however there are still small macrovoids present beneath the outer surface of the p l e fig 6 shows the p l w membrane with different licl and water contents in the dope solution it is interesting to observe that all the p l w membranes exhibited a fully sponge like macrovoids free and open cell structure however the membranes showed quite different inner surface morphologies with the same bore fluid h2o nmp 30 70 the pore size at the inner surface increased with the water concentration in the additive mixture it adheres to the previous result that the presence of water promoted the formation of big pores the cross sectional sem image of the p l w membrane was also presented in fig 6 it shows that all the pores were inter connected and the pore size was similar at the cross section of the membranes with different amounts of licl and water in the additive mixtures fig 7 showed the high magnification sem images of the outer edges of the hf membranes it is apparent that the p l membrane was made of a thick and dense outer layer with globular like structure the spherical globules were reported as the pvdf crystal formed in the phase separation process 20 25 when licl water mixture was used the dense outer layer disappeared instead the p l w membranes showed a porous outer layer with bicontinuous pore structure the different membrane morphology can be assigned to the use of licl water mixture that induced simultaneous solvent de mixing and crystallization behavior as the licl water ratio decreased in the mixture the viscosity of the p l w dope solution decreased as shown in fig 3 the kinetic effect dominated by the high dope viscosity was slightly diminished the liquid liquid de mixing occurred rapidly and the crystallization was therefore effectively hindered it shows in fig 7 that the p l w membrane exhibited similar pore structure at the outer layer when the content of licl water was 3 1 and 2 2 however significant amounts of macrovoids were generated beneath the skin layer of the membrane as licl and water content was 1 and 3 respectively the results are well consistent with the results in table 3 that the p l w3 membrane showed the highest porosity and pore size in all the p l w membranes 3 3 mechanical characteristics fig 8 shows the mechanical characteristics of the hf membranes spun from different polymer solution with different additives it is obvious that the additive changed both tensile stress and young s modulus of the pvdf membrane the membrane p l showed simultaneously improved stiffness and tensile stress in contrast to the p o however the addition of water and eg sacrificed mechanical stability of the membranes p w and p e which was ascribed to the increased amounts of finger like macrovoids in the matrix 20 the mechanical property of the membrane is strongly dominated by the pore structure of the membrane the membrane with sponge like pores and low bulk porosity was found mechanically more robust than the membrane made of macrovoids it was shown in table 3 that the bulk porosity and mean pore size of the membranes p w and p e were sharply increased from 64 4 and 0 08 μm to 81 3 and 0 19 μm and 80 2 and 0 17 μm respectively thus the single addition of water and eg reduced the membrane s mechanical strength due to the newly introduced finger like macrovoids however the impregnation of licl suppressed the formation of finger like macrovoids and enhanced the physical robustness of the pvdf membrane it has been revealed in fig 5 that the membranes p w e and p l e were characterized with large amounts of macrovoids the addition of licl inhibited the formation of large pores at the inner layer of the membrane however it cannot remove the macrovoids in the outer layer which resulted in a low mechanical stability as shown in fig 8 the mixed additive of water and licl brought a macrovoids free membrane with enhanced stiffness and tensile strength of the membrane p l w 3 4 dcmd results the dcmd performance of the hf membranes spun from dope solutions with different additives was shown in fig 9 the membrane p e possessed the highest water flux of 18 22 kg m 2 h 1 and energy efficiency of 80 2 the improved dcmd performance was attributed to the significant enhancement of membrane porosity especially the effective porosity induced by the addition of eg it is worthy to mention that the use of eg as a non solvent has been widely reported on the design and fabrication of the pvdf dual layer hf membrane for md application 32 41 46 similarly the addition of water promoted both water flux and energy efficiency compared to the p o membrane however the membrane p l showed the lowest water flux and energy efficiency due to its low porosity and small pore size the result was in good agreement with the fact that the dcmd performance was determined by the pore size and the effective porosity of the membranes 23 the dcmd performances of the hf membranes with the additive mixtures were also listed in fig 9 because of the presence of large macrovoids the membrane p e w possessed a much higher permeate water flux of 16 42 kg m 2 h 1 than the membranes with the mixed additives of licl water and licl eg the permeate water flux of the hf membranes p l e p l w1 p l w2 and p l w3 was 14 17 7 72 14 32 and 14 82 kg m 2 h 1 respectively interestingly the membranes p l w2 and p l w3 showed a comparable water flux and enhanced energy efficiency to the hf membrane p l e xiang et al reported that the pore size at the cross section of the pvdf membrane was almost the same at different licl concentration ranging from 1 to 4 47 however the use of the licl water mixture increased the pore size at both the inner layer and the outer surface as shown in fig 6 and table 3 which can be used to explain the increased energy efficiency of the p l w2 and p l w3 membranes considering the use of low concentration of licl 2 and the effective pore size enhancement of water the licl water mixture offered a cost effective way to obtain the macrovoids free pvdf membranes with simultaneously improved performance in dcmd the membrane wetting behavior of the dcmd membrane was influenced by membrane characteristics feed chemistry and the dcmd operating conditions such as circulating velocity and hot brine temperature the continuous dcmd experiments were performed for 480 min to investigate the anti wetting ability of the hf membranes with different additives the experiment was terminated when the conductivity on the permeate side reached 20 μs cm 1 which corresponded to a salt rejection lower than 99 99 the recorded time was considered as the initial time that the membrane got wetted during the dcmd process the feed solution tank was refilled with di water and the salinity of the feed solution was maintained at 100 000 mg l the electrical conductivity of the permeate water was plotted in fig 10 it has to be mentioned here that both high salinity and flow rate were used in this study to intensify the membrane wetting phenomenon the membrane with poor anti wetting ability was detected in a relatively short operating time it can be seen in fig 10 that the membrane p w suffered from the most severe wetting phenomenon and the conductivity was sharply increased in 75 min of the dmcd operation the neat pvdf membrane p o was wetted at the operating time of 120 min the membrane p e exhibited better anti wetting performance than the membranes p o and p w however the permeate water s conductivity slightly increased at the operating time of 150 min and it reached 20 μs cm 1 at 350 min this interesting phenomenon could ascribe to the narrow pore size distribution of the membrane p e the pvdf membrane with licl as the single additive showed stable permeate water conductivity in the continuous 480 mins of dcmd operation attributing to the smallest pore size and highest lep as shown in table 3 we can also see in fig 10 that the membrane p e w and p l e was partially wetted after 135 mins and 150 mins of the dcmd operation respectively however the membranes p l w1 and p l w2 showed promising anti wetting behaviors similar to the membrane p l the conductivity of the collected permeate was less than 10 μs cm during the dcmd process which indicated a more than 99 99 salt rejection when the content of licl and water was 1 and 3 the membrane p l w3 was wetted at the operating time of 250 mins this can be explained by the existence of macrovoids underneath the outer surface of the membrane as discussed in fig 6 fig 11 summarized the dcmd performance of the hf membrane with different small mw molecule additives compared to the neat membrane most of the membranes exhibited a simultaneous increase in water flux and wetting resistance excepting the hf membrane p w with the accelerated wetting phenomenon and the membranes p l and p l w1 with reduced water flux it should be noted that the membrane p l w2 revealed both enhanced water flux and wetting resistance during the entire dcmd process in combination with the mechanical properties the membrane p l w2 almost satisfied all the required characteristics for dcmd which include high mechanical strength permeate flux and the anti wetting ability the use of licl h2o mixture gained promising enhancement on the dcmd performance of the pvdf membranes 4 conclusion in this work pvdf hf membranes were prepared for the particular use in dcmd by the incorporating of different small mw additives both membrane characteristics and the dcmd performance were explored in treatment of a 100 000 mg l brine solution several conclusions were drawn as follows 1 each small mw additive has unique advantages to design a particular dcmd membrane the addition of water favors the membrane s overall porosity and pore size eg incurs outstanding effective surface porosity outer surface roughness and a narrow pore size distribution the use of licl results in a significant enhancement in lep and mechanical stability due to the effective elimination of macrovoids 2 in the membrane formation process the competition between thermodynamic effect and kinetic effect can be well balanced by adjusting the composition of the additive mixtures to obtain the desirable dcmd hf membrane with promising performance regarding high permeate water flux and wetting resistance 3 the pvdf hf membrane spun from the dope pvdf licl h2o nmp 12 2 2 84 satisfied most of the designed properties for dcmd application which include high mechanical strength water flux and anti wetting behavior declaration of

personal interest of any nature or kind in any product service and or company that could be construed as influencing the position presented in or the review of the manuscript entitled desirable pvdf hollow fiber membrane engineered with synergism between small molecular weight additives for dcmd desalination of a hypersaline brine 
13216,developing membrane for brine waste reclamation via direct contact membrane distillation dcmd requires specially membrane characteristics engineering toward practical and scalable hydrophobic micromembrane with desirable properties attaining energy efficient and durability during hypersaline treatment remains a great challenge herein polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf hollow fiber hf membranes were developed for particular use in dcmd for treating hypersaline 100 000 mg l of nacl solution via adopting mixture of small molecular weight mw additives including water lithium chloride licl and

performance the research emphasis is placed on the synergistic effect between small molecular weight additives resulting in a much enhanced performance the dope solution of pvdf licl h2o n methyl 2 pyrrolidone nmp 12 2 2 84 wt spun hf membrane p l w2 has been shown to reveal the most desirable membrane characteristics for dcmd including comparable porosity ε 74 2 0 4 superior liquid entry pressure lep 3 05 bar and robust mechanical properties the p l w2 membrane also exhibited enhanced water flux energy efficiency and anti wetting ability in comparison with the neat pvdf hf membrane with advantage of easy implement the concept of adoption of additives mixture provides a novel platform to customize desirable pvdf hf membranes with enhanced dcmd performance keywords small molecular weight additive polyvinylidene fluoride hollow fiber membrane direct contact membrane distillation high salinity brine 1 introduction direct contact membrane distillation dcmd can utilize clean energy or waste heat to treat high salinity challenging water and it has been considered as a promising and efficient process within the water energy nexus 1 4 in a typical dcmd hot stream and cold water flow along the two surfaces of a microporous hydrophobic membrane that functions as a medium for the vapor transfer even though the membrane acts only as a barrier to avoid the contact between the two water streams and it does not contribute to the selectivity in dcmd the properties of the membrane including structure raw material and configuration all have a significant role in the dcmd performance 3 5 6 based on the previous literature a desirable dcmd membrane should satisfy several specific characteristics such as low thermal conductivity optimum membrane thickness desirable pore size and pore size distribution and high porosity both bulk porosity and effective porosity surface hydrophobicity and degrees of pores interconnectivity good chemical resistance thermal stability and physical robustness 7 9 an ideal dcmd membrane should also be accompanied with high water flux long term structure robustness and high energy efficiency ee despite enormous research interests into dcmd membrane properties over the past decade there is plenty of room for further advancement particularly with the widely employed pvdf hf membrane the investigation and engineering regarding its overall performance and viability for water treatment are still badly required 3 8 10 11 porous pvdf hf membranes are usually prepared via a non solvent induced phase separation nips method the introduction of suitable additives to dope solution is a simple and efficient strategy to enhance dcmd performance by tuning the membrane structure in general the use of additives can either change the thermodynamic state of the casting solution to shift the liquid liquid demixing and or modify the dope viscosity to alter the mass exchange rate between non solvent and solvent the structure and morphology of the pvdf membrane are highly determined by the trade off between the thermal dynamic effect and the kinetic effect the commonly used additives include high molecular weight mw additives including polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp 12 13 polyvinyl alcohol pva 14 and poly ethylene glycol peg 15 and small mw additives lithium chloride licl 16 18 lithium perchlorate liclo4 19 ethylene glycol eg alcohols 20 glycerol 2 17 21 22 and water h2o 18 20 21 23 it has been found that the high mw additives tended to remain in the membrane matrix which may reduce the membrane hydrophobicity 13 18 21 the addition of high mw additives generally accelerated the mass exchange rate and resulted in the formation of macrovoids the existence of macrovoids under the skin layer can intensify the phenomenon of membrane wetting and thus resulted in a significant detriment of salt rejection in dcmd 7 24 in contrast to high mw additive the small mw one could be lightly leached out during the membrane formation process and the following post treating procedure 13 the hydrophobicity of the membrane was able to maintain and even increase due to the improved surface roughness 25 the use of licl has been extensively reported in the previous literature 16 18 26 28 licl could dramatically augment the polymer solution viscosity due to the complex interactions between licl and the solvent and the macromolecular fluctuating networks created by li and the electron donor group of pvdf 16 however most of the results were lack of consistency and there is still no report on the use of additives for a desirable dcmd membrane for example the addition of licl was found effective in reducing the amount of macrovoids and improve the mechanical stability of the pvdf membrane 17 26 nevertheless several studies also reported that the membrane pore size could be enlarged as the addition of licl which resulted in reduced strength of the resultant membrane 16 18 27 28 h2o and eg are commonly used small mw non solvents for pvdf membrane fabrication as well because the water pvdf interaction was relatively weak the addition of h2o to the polymer solution accelerated the macrovoids formation in the membrane matrix 20 23 khayet et al reported the influence of h2o in the pvdf solution on the properties of the resultant membrane 23 the results showed that both the membrane porosity and pore size of the membranes increased with the water content in the pvdf dope the pvdf water membrane showed an exponentially increased water flux in vacuum membrane distillation vmd li et al 21 drew a similar conclusion that the introduction of water into the pvdf dope drastically improved the permeate flux similar studies have been performed by using eg as the additive for the pvdf membrane wang et al 25 reported a pvdf based hf membrane for dcmd application with eg as the additive the pvdf eg membrane possessed comparable dcmd performance with the commercially available pvdf hf membranes khayet et al 29 revealed eg concentration effects on the vmd performance of the pvdf membrane mokhtar et al 13 fabricated the pvdf membranes with pvp and eg compared to pvp the incorporation of eg avoided the adverse effect on the membrane hydrophobicity and enhanced both water flux and salt rejection in md besides the use of single small mw additive the mixture of the additives was also formulated to fabricate pvdf membranes such as licl water 18 licl 1 propanol 18 licl eg 30 and licl peg 31 as a general rule the three small mw additives licl water and eg showed different advantages in the engineering of a desirable pvdf membrane for dcmd 1 licl can eliminate the formation of macrovoids and cure the surface defects which improved both salt rejection and mechanical stability 2 the incorporation of water promoted the permeate flux through the significant increase in pore size 3 the use of eg could narrow the pore size distribution and enhance the anti wetting ability of the membrane by shrinking the pore size and thus achieved long term operating stability therefore it is technically feasible to obtain a pvdf hf membrane with all the desirable properties for particular use in dcmd by formulating the pvdf dope solution with multiple components of small mw additives the synergism between small mw additives might well combine their respective advantage leading to a much improved dcmd performance despite the fact that a couple of previous literature have revealed that the use of small mw additive mixtures possessed high potentials in fabricating pvdf hf membranes 30 32 there were still rare reports focusing on the engineering of a desirable pvdf membrane for the particular use in dcmd especially the treatment of the impaired water with a relatively high salinity 70 000 mg l was seldom considered in the evaluation of a specific pvdf membrane for dcmd in this study pvdf hf membranes were engineered with all the desirable dcmd properties for the treatment of a 100 000 mg l brine solution three different small mw additives licl h2o and eg and their mixtures were used to fabricate the pvdf hf membranes the synergetic effects of small mw additives on characteristics of the pvdf hf membrane and the obtained dcmd performance were all explored the result of this study is expected to provide a guideline for the selection of small mw additives to design high performance pvdf hf membranes for particular use in dcmd 2 experimental 2 1 materials the commercial pvdf resin model kynar hsv 900 was supplied by arkema inc the chemicals including n methyl 2 pyrrolidone nmp 99 9 lithium chloride licl 99 isopropanol ipa 98 5 and ethylene glycol eg 99 9 were all bought from sigma aldrich for the fabrication or characterization of hf membranes sodium chloride nacl 99 8 and pure kerosene were acquired from merck and sunnyside respectively ultra pure water was attained from a thermo scientific barnstead genpure pro water purification system 2 2 dope preparation and hf membrane fabrication the polymer powder was first dried in a vacuum oven at 70 c for a day the powder was then dissolved in nmp with the addition of different types of small mw additives the obtained homogeneous dope was degassed for another 12 h at 25 c the rheological properties of the dope solutions were measured using a physica mcr301 rheometer equipped with a coaxial cylinder anton paar germany the shear rate was 7 3 s 1 the dope formulas and the spinning conditions for membrane fabrication are tabulated in tables 1 and 2 respectively 2 3 characterization 2 3 1 membrane morphology the hf membrane morphologies including cross sectional outer and inner surface were examined by an fei quanta 200 3d fib sem system the membrane samples for cross section observation were immersed and fractured in liquid nitrogen to eliminate physical deformation all of the samples were deposited with a thin platinum layer using a metal coater jeol jfc 1300 japan 2 3 2 overall porosity maximum pore size mean pore size and effective porosity the dried membrane sample was first weighted in the air by an accurate analytical balance mettler toledo model xpe205 the sample was soaked in liquid kerosene for 120 h to be thoroughly wetted the membrane was then taken out from the kerosene and the residual solvent was wiped off carefully the wet membrane was weighted again the overall porosity ε can be estimated by eq 1 1 ε 4 w 2 w 1 πl od 2 id 2 ρ k where w 1 g is the weight of the dry membrane w 2 g is the weight of the wet membrane l m is the length of the hf membrane od and id m are the outer and inner diameters of the hf membrane respectively ρ k is the density of kerosene 0 82 g cm3 five tests for one sample were made to guarantee the accuracy of the result the maximum pore size of the hf membrane was obtained from the bubble point method described in the standard astm f316 33 35 briefly a single hf membrane was potted with epoxy resin in a 5 cm transparent tube isopropanol was filled in the shell side of the hf membrane for 24 h nitrogen was charged into the lumen of the hf membrane to replace the isopropanol that fully occupied in the membrane matrix a backpressure regulator was installed to adjust the pressure of nitrogen when the first bubble was observed the associated pressure was determined as the bubble point pressure the maximum pore size follows the laplace equation 2 d m 4 σ p cos θ where δp pa is the transmembrane pressure difference σ n m is the surface tension and θ the contact angle between the liquid and membrane surface the mean pore size and effective porosity were evaluated by a volume displacement based gas permeation experiment 16 29 36 the gas permeation experiments procedures have been detailed elsewhere 37 the membrane module was first assembled using two pieces of hf membranes ultrapure nitrogen was introduced to the lumen of the hf membrane and the trans membrane pressure was regulated through the backpressure regulator the gas flow lasted for at least 5 min to reach a steady state in which the pressure differential was stable across the membrane during the permeation measurement the volumetric gas flow rate was estimated with a digital flow meter aalborg mass flow controller under various feed pressures the vapor through a dcmd hf membrane could be assumed to diffusive flow and viscous flow as follow 38 3 j ε lrt d p 2 32 μ p d p 3 8 r t π m w where j is the gas permeance r j kg k is the gas constant t k is temperature d p m is the mean pore diameter μ is gas viscosity pa s p pa is transmembrane pressure difference and mw g mol is the feed gas molecular weight the eq 3 could be rearranged as follow 4 j δp s o p i o the slope

angle measurement of hf membranes external surface was performed at room temperature using a tensiometer sigma 701 ksv instruments ltd usa ten tests for per sample was conducted to guarantee the result accuracy 2 3 4 lep measurement fig 1 is the schematic illustration of self assembled apparatus for lep test the membrane module was made of 10 pieces of hf membranes and the effective length was 16 cm one end of the hf membrane module was connected with a back pressure transducer bpt 0 250 psig swagelok and the other end was introduced to a 3 5 wt nacl brine during the lep measurement the whole membrane module was first immersed in di water tank the feed nacl brine was then injected into the lumen side of the hf membranes via the isco syringe pump the feed pressure augmented with a step of 0 05 bar and each feed pressure was kept about 10 mins the conductivity of the di water was measured with a tds electrical conductivity meter model hatch 40d usa the lep was recorded as the pressure observed when the electrical conductivity in the water beaker was sharply increased 2 3 5 mechanical properties the uniaxial tensile test method was utilized to test the mechanical characteristics of the hf membrane the maximum tensile stress young s modulus and elongation at break were all tested by mts criterion model 44 the membrane sample was clamped with a gauge length of 50 mm and the measurement was conducted at a speed of 50 mm min the final recorded mechanical magnitude for one sample was averaged from at least ten tests 2 4 dcmd experiment fig 2 schematically illustrated the apparatus for the dcmd experiment in this study the membrane module was made of 10 pieces of hf membranes and the effective length was 16 cm in the dcmd process 100 000 mg l nacl and di water were circulated along with the shell side and lumen of hf membrane with a linear velocity of 2 0 m s and 1 0 m s respectively the feed and cold streams maintained at 60 c and 20 c respectively the inlet and outlet temperatures of the feed solution and the permeate water were all recorded with four temperature transducers the collected was weighted with a digital scale equipped with a data acquisition system the conductivity of permeate was measured by a conductivity meter the energy efficiency ee was evaluated by taking both the effective heat for water evaporation q w and the undesirable heat loss q c into consideration and the calculation was demonstrated using the following equation 7 ee q w q w q c a o j w λ w v p c p t p out t p in where a o m2 is the hot stream

heat capacity of the permeate solution and t p in k and t p out k are temperatures in inlet and outlet of cold stream k respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of single small mw additive the single small mw additives including licl water and eg were used to fabricate the pvdf hf membrane as listed in table 1 the concentration of pvdf was 12 wt and it was 4 wt 4 wt and 8 wt for licl water and eg respectively the selected amount of additives in the pvdf solution were determined from the water tolerance and viscosity of the dope solution referred from the previous literature 7 20 23 25 30 39 detailly the pvdf solutions with additives were selected close to their critical cloud point for obtaining desirable dcmd performance as recommended in previous work 39 the characteristics of the pvdf hf membranes with different additives including dimensions porosity overall porosity and effective porosity pore size surface hydrophobicity and lep are listed in table 3 the p l membrane was much less porous than the p o membrane as indicated by the reduced overall porosity and effective porosity of 56 7 0 9 and 642 m 1 respectively this result is different from the previous report that the membrane porosity increased when licl was incorporated into the polymer solution 16 27 it has been widely reported that the pore forming reagent of licl was able to induce a quick liquid liquid demixing because the decrease in thermodynamic miscibility thermodynamic effect the phase inversion was also delayed as the result of viscosity enhancement kinetic effect 16 18 26 27 besides the concentration of licl the factors of pvdf molecular weight pvdf concentration and the properties of solvent all affected the thermodynamic miscibility and viscosity of the dope solution in this study kynar hsv 900 pvdf was used as an ultra high molecular weight polymer among the commonly used commercially available pvdf polymer resins 40 furthermore the interaction between li ion and nmp was also proved to be stronger than the others 27 as a result the introduced small amount of licl considerably increased the dope viscosity it shows in fig 3 that the viscosity of pvdf licl eg nmp 12 2 4 82 and pvdf licl h2o nmp 12 1 3 84 reached up to 21 850 cp and 21 243 cp respectively which was much higher than the viscosity of pvdf nmp 12 88 it seems that the hf membrane structure was mainly affected by the kinetic effect but less from the thermodynamic effect as listed in table 3 the lep of the p l membrane was 5 05 bar which was owing to the decreased pore dimension and elimination of macro voids in the membrane matrix the incorporation of eg increased the overall porosity and effective porosity of the pvdf hf membrane to 80 2 0 6 and 5445 7 m 1 respectively the p e membrane also exhibited enhanced hydrophobicity and the contact angle was improved to 105 6 0 1 from 87 4 0 4 of the p o membrane this can be explained by the improved membrane surface roughness induced by the high effective porosity on the p e membrane surface 39 table 3 also listed that the p e membrane showed a relatively narrow pore diameter distribution with the mean pore size of 0 17 μm and the maximum pore size of 0 21 μm in contrast to 0 08 μm and 0 27 μm of the p o membrane the lep of the p e membrane was 1 8 bars which indicated an enhanced anti wetting ability because of the improved both membrane hydrophobicity and the narrower pore size distribution the use of water as the additive was more complex than licl and eg similar to licl the incorporation of water raised the polymer solution viscosity the presence of water also deteriorated the thermodynamic stability and impeded the rheological characteristics of the pvdf solution the influence of water on polymer solution can also be explained by the solubility parameter difference it is obvious in table 4 that pvdf water showed a more significant solubility parameter difference than pvdf eg which demonstrated a faster dope precipitation rate with water as the additive compared to that with eg 20 41 it shows in table 3 that the p w hf membrane possesses the highest overall porosity which reached up to 81 3 0 7 the biggest maximum pore size and the lowest lep among all the spun hf membranes the morphologies of the pvdf hf membranes were also examined and the results are demonstrated in fig 4 the use of small mw additive remarkably altered the structure of the membrane which includes membrane dimension amount and size of the macrovoids percentage of the spongy like structure membrane thickness roughness of the skin surface and pore size of the inner surface it shows in fig 4 that significant amounts of pyriform like macrovoids are observed at the cross sectional of the p o membrane that possessed a dense and smooth outer surface and a highly porous inner surface however with the addition of licl the p l membrane showed a dramatically different structure the loading of licl effectively suppressed the formation of macrovoids and the p l membrane showed a fully sponge like asymmetric structure in addition the surface morphology at the two sides of the p l membrane was changed compared to the p o membrane the p l membrane comprised a less uniform and porous inner surface and a smoother outer surface with small pores formed the p l membrane also exhibits a much denser outer layer compared to the p o membrane by comparing the cross sectional morphologies of p w to p o it was found that the amount of macrovoids at the cross section increased when water was incorporated this should be resulted from the weak interaction between water and pvdf in the phase inversion process 18 20 44 the morphology is consistent with the results in table 3 that the overall porosity mean pore size and maximum pore size all increased and the lep decreased when water was used as the additive which indicated that the accelerated thermodynamic immiscibility plays a more important role than the kinetic effect from the increased dope viscosity in the membrane formation process the addition of water primarily works as a de mixing enhancer that boosted the liquid liquid phase separation and resulted in the formation of pyriform like macrovoids the p e membrane comprised a porous sponge like inner layer and a porous outer layer which contains numerous pyriform like macrovoids the inner layer thickness was almost the same with the finger like outer layer the formation of sponge like inner layer was attributed to the delayed phase inversion process caused by the presence of enriched solvent in the bore fluid in addition the p e membrane showed a rougher and thinner outer surface than the p o membrane which is in well accordance with the previous study 25 in the membrane formation process the semi crystalline pvdf undergoes both liquid liquid de mixing and crystallization liquid solid de mixing behaviors the dope solution with different additives experienced distinguished composition paths during the membrane formation process as a strong non solvent the use of water promoted the instantaneous liquid liquid de mixing which suppressed the pvdf molecules interaction and resulted in high bulk porosity and large maximum pore size the addition of eg has less influence on the apparent viscosity of the pvdf solution but helped to lessen the affinity of the dope to water 45 thus the solvent exchange rate was decelerated which resulted in the formation of highly porous and roughness outer surface the use of licl was effective to slow down the phase separation rate and led the obtained membrane showing a fully sponge like structure to fabricate a porous pvdf hf membrane with specific membrane structure for dcmd application the mixture of small mw additives was formulated for pvdf membrane fabrication in the next section 3 2 comparison study of additive mixtures the pvdf dope viscosity with different additive mixtures was listed in fig 3 the mixture with licl showed obviously increased viscosity compared to the others the viscosity of the p w e dope solution was 18 572 cp which is slightly higher than the p e dope solution but lower than the p w dope the results of membrane properties were listed in table 3 the bulk porosity of the p o membrane was 64 4 and it increased to the range of 70 to 82 for the membranes with the additive mixtures it is obvious that the use of the mixed additives enhanced the bulk porosity the pvdf membrane the membrane with the additive mixtures of licl eg and licl water possessed higher bulk porosity and effective surface porosity than the membrane with single licl as the additive additionally the porosity of the pvdf hf membrane increased with the increased amount of water in the additive mixture of licl water the formulation of small mw additive mixtures can effectively tailor the membrane structure including porosity pore size hydrophobicity and lep similar to the use of single additive the membrane pore size reduced with the rise of licl concentration corresponding to an increased lep the addition of eg and water increased the membrane s effective porosity and pore size respectively fig 5 shows that the sem images of the p e w hf membrane was made of the finger like macrovoids stretched from almost the middle to outer surface with the addition of eg and water the water in the coagulant bath diffused faster into the nascent polymer matrix and formed a polymer lean phase the nucleation growth of the polymer lean phase resulted in pyriform like macrovoids for the membrane with licl eg as the additive mixture as shown in fig 5 the formation of large macrovoids was effectively suppressed along the cross section of the membrane which was attributed to the increased dope viscosity because of licl the augmented viscosity of polymer solution caused a delayed liquid liquid de mixing or spinodal composition and thus the intrusion of water into the nascent polymer matrix was hindered 7 however there are still small macrovoids present beneath the outer surface of the p l e fig 6 shows the p l w membrane with different licl and water contents in the dope solution it is interesting to observe that all the p l w membranes exhibited a fully sponge like macrovoids free and open cell structure however the membranes showed quite different inner surface morphologies with the same bore fluid h2o nmp 30 70 the pore size at the inner surface increased with the water concentration in the additive mixture it adheres to the previous result that the presence of water promoted the formation of big pores the cross sectional sem image of the p l w membrane was also presented in fig 6 it shows that all the pores were inter connected and the pore size was similar at the cross section of the membranes with different amounts of licl and water in the additive mixtures fig 7 showed the high magnification sem images of the outer edges of the hf membranes it is apparent that the p l membrane was made of a thick and dense outer layer with globular like structure the spherical globules were reported as the pvdf crystal formed in the phase separation process 20 25 when licl water mixture was used the dense outer layer disappeared instead the p l w membranes showed a porous outer layer with bicontinuous pore structure the different membrane morphology can be assigned to the use of licl water mixture that induced simultaneous solvent de mixing and crystallization behavior as the licl water ratio decreased in the mixture the viscosity of the p l w dope solution decreased as shown in fig 3 the kinetic effect dominated by the high dope viscosity was slightly diminished the liquid liquid de mixing occurred rapidly and the crystallization was therefore effectively hindered it shows in fig 7 that the p l w membrane exhibited similar pore structure at the outer layer when the content of licl water was 3 1 and 2 2 however significant amounts of macrovoids were generated beneath the skin layer of the membrane as licl and water content was 1 and 3 respectively the results are well consistent with the results in table 3 that the p l w3 membrane showed the highest porosity and pore size in all the p l w membranes 3 3 mechanical characteristics fig 8 shows the mechanical characteristics of the hf membranes spun from different polymer solution with different additives it is obvious that the additive changed both tensile stress and young s modulus of the pvdf membrane the membrane p l showed simultaneously improved stiffness and tensile stress in contrast to the p o however the addition of water and eg sacrificed mechanical stability of the membranes p w and p e which was ascribed to the increased amounts of finger like macrovoids in the matrix 20 the mechanical property of the membrane is strongly dominated by the pore structure of the membrane the membrane with sponge like pores and low bulk porosity was found mechanically more robust than the membrane made of macrovoids it was shown in table 3 that the bulk porosity and mean pore size of the membranes p w and p e were sharply increased from 64 4 and 0 08 μm to 81 3 and 0 19 μm and 80 2 and 0 17 μm respectively thus the single addition of water and eg reduced the membrane s mechanical strength due to the newly introduced finger like macrovoids however the impregnation of licl suppressed the formation of finger like macrovoids and enhanced the physical robustness of the pvdf membrane it has been revealed in fig 5 that the membranes p w e and p l e were characterized with large amounts of macrovoids the addition of licl inhibited the formation of large pores at the inner layer of the membrane however it cannot remove the macrovoids in the outer layer which resulted in a low mechanical stability as shown in fig 8 the mixed additive of water and licl brought a macrovoids free membrane with enhanced stiffness and tensile strength of the membrane p l w 3 4 dcmd results the dcmd performance of the hf membranes spun from dope solutions with different additives was shown in fig 9 the membrane p e possessed the highest water flux of 18 22 kg m 2 h 1 and energy efficiency of 80 2 the improved dcmd performance was attributed to the significant enhancement of membrane porosity especially the effective porosity induced by the addition of eg it is worthy to mention that the use of eg as a non solvent has been widely reported on the design and fabrication of the pvdf dual layer hf membrane for md application 32 41 46 similarly the addition of water promoted both water flux and energy efficiency compared to the p o membrane however the membrane p l showed the lowest water flux and energy efficiency due to its low porosity and small pore size the result was in good agreement with the fact that the dcmd performance was determined by the pore size and the effective porosity of the membranes 23 the dcmd performances of the hf membranes with the additive mixtures were also listed in fig 9 because of the presence of large macrovoids the membrane p e w possessed a much higher permeate water flux of 16 42 kg m 2 h 1 than the membranes with the mixed additives of licl water and licl eg the permeate water flux of the hf membranes p l e p l w1 p l w2 and p l w3 was 14 17 7 72 14 32 and 14 82 kg m 2 h 1 respectively interestingly the membranes p l w2 and p l w3 showed a comparable water flux and enhanced energy efficiency to the hf membrane p l e xiang et al reported that the pore size at the cross section of the pvdf membrane was almost the same at different licl concentration ranging from 1 to 4 47 however the use of the licl water mixture increased the pore size at both the inner layer and the outer surface as shown in fig 6 and table 3 which can be used to explain the increased energy efficiency of the p l w2 and p l w3 membranes considering the use of low concentration of licl 2 and the effective pore size enhancement of water the licl water mixture offered a cost effective way to obtain the macrovoids free pvdf membranes with simultaneously improved performance in dcmd the membrane wetting behavior of the dcmd membrane was influenced by membrane characteristics feed chemistry and the dcmd operating conditions such as circulating velocity and hot brine temperature the continuous dcmd experiments were performed for 480 min to investigate the anti wetting ability of the hf membranes with different additives the experiment was terminated when the conductivity on the permeate side reached 20 μs cm 1 which corresponded to a salt rejection lower than 99 99 the recorded time was considered as the initial time that the membrane got wetted during the dcmd process the feed solution tank was refilled with di water and the salinity of the feed solution was maintained at 100 000 mg l the electrical conductivity of the permeate water was plotted in fig 10 it has to be mentioned here that both high salinity and flow rate were used in this study to intensify the membrane wetting phenomenon the membrane with poor anti wetting ability was detected in a relatively short operating time it can be seen in fig 10 that the membrane p w suffered from the most severe wetting phenomenon and the conductivity was sharply increased in 75 min of the dmcd operation the neat pvdf membrane p o was wetted at the operating time of 120 min the membrane p e exhibited better anti wetting performance than the membranes p o and p w however the permeate water s conductivity slightly increased at the operating time of 150 min and it reached 20 μs cm 1 at 350 min this interesting phenomenon could ascribe to the narrow pore size distribution of the membrane p e the pvdf membrane with licl as the single additive showed stable permeate water conductivity in the continuous 480 mins of dcmd operation attributing to the smallest pore size and highest lep as shown in table 3 we can also see in fig 10 that the membrane p e w and p l e was partially wetted after 135 mins and 150 mins of the dcmd operation respectively however the membranes p l w1 and p l w2 showed promising anti wetting behaviors similar to the membrane p l the conductivity of the collected permeate was less than 10 μs cm during the dcmd process which indicated a more than 99 99 salt rejection when the content of licl and water was 1 and 3 the membrane p l w3 was wetted at the operating time of 250 mins this can be explained by the existence of macrovoids underneath the outer surface of the membrane as discussed in fig 6 fig 11 summarized the dcmd performance of the hf membrane with different small mw molecule additives compared to the neat membrane most of the membranes exhibited a simultaneous increase in water flux and wetting resistance excepting the hf membrane p w with the accelerated wetting phenomenon and the membranes p l and p l w1 with reduced water flux it should be noted that the membrane p l w2 revealed both enhanced water flux and wetting resistance during the entire dcmd process in combination with the mechanical properties the membrane p l w2 almost satisfied all the required characteristics for dcmd which include high mechanical strength permeate flux and the anti wetting ability the use of licl h2o mixture gained promising enhancement on the dcmd performance of the pvdf membranes 4 conclusion in this work pvdf hf membranes were prepared for the particular use in dcmd by the incorporating of different small mw additives both membrane characteristics and the dcmd performance were explored in treatment of a 100 000 mg l brine solution several conclusions were drawn as follows 1 each small mw additive has unique advantages to design a particular dcmd membrane the addition of water favors the membrane s overall porosity and pore size eg incurs outstanding effective surface porosity outer surface roughness and a narrow pore size distribution the use of licl results in a significant enhancement in lep and mechanical stability due to the effective elimination of macrovoids 2 in the membrane formation process the competition between thermodynamic effect and kinetic effect can be well balanced by adjusting the composition of the additive mixtures to obtain the desirable dcmd hf membrane with promising performance regarding high permeate water flux and wetting resistance 3 the pvdf hf membrane spun from the dope pvdf licl h2o nmp 12 2 2 84 satisfied most of the designed properties for dcmd application which include high mechanical strength water flux and anti wetting behavior declaration of

13217,biochar is considered as black gold in environmental remediation field due to its high surface area light density great adsorption capacity biochar has high potential to improve the wastewater purification in constructed wetlands cws which has been increasingly investigated in this decade this paper reviews the characteristics of biochar methods of preparation pollutant removal effects and the greenhouse gas ghg emission reduction in cws systematically which could guide further studies of biochar application in cws it was found that the biochar applied in cws were mainly produced by pyrolysis of terrestrial plants while the biochar produced from marine biology or by other procedures may have different performance due to the various properties which needed further investigation biochar affected cw performance through multiple pathways including influencing the physicochemical hydraulic conditions and biological behavior in cws the quantified enhancement of pollutant removal by biochar addition in cws was firstly summarized research data proved that medians of cod ammonia and tn removal in biochar added cws were 109 145 and 178 as much as those in non biochar cws respectively moreover the most significant improvement showed under oxygen shortage condition in cws rather than aeration condition however it remains unclear which pathway dominates the enhanced pollutant removal besides biochar commonly decreased n2o emission from cws while the opposite results were also reported and a comprehensive explanation has not been reached therefore future mechanism studies are needed to advance our understanding on biochar s behavior in cws for wastewater treatment abbreviations ghg greenhouse gas cw constructed wetland keywords biochar constructed wetland greenhouse gas emission nitrogen removal wastewater treatment 1 introduction biochar was applied in many kinds of soil amendment 1 3 and wastewater treatment systems 4 5 in this decade due to its high surface area light density great adsorption capacity 6 and the potential to decrease greenhouse gas ghg emission 7 based on searches in databases in the web of science the application of biochar in wastewater treatment started several years later than in soil amendment fig 1 about 2000 papers discussed biochar application in wastewater treatment among which several dozens of sci papers focused on its application in constructed wetland cw constructed wetland treatment system 8 specifically engineered to purify wastewater consisted of substrate microbes and plants 9 cws could be further classified into free water surface and horizontal or vertical subsurface systems according to wetland hydrology 10 all the papers about biochar application in cws were published in the recent 5 years indicating it is a study hotspot as a popular material applied in environment a systematical summary of biochar s function in cws is needed hence this paper discussed the characteristics of biochar its mechanism and function in constructed wetlands cws the enhanced performance of wastewater purification in cws and the ghg emission in cws influenced by biochar which could guide further studies of biochar application in cws 2 the characteristics of biochar applied in constructed wetlands 2 1 source of biochar biochar has many sources which could be divided into four categories i e agricultural wastes and wood food wastes marine feedstocks and sewage sludges shown in table 1 during the application in cws agricultural wastes and wood derived biochar were widely applied among which bamboo was popular as a feedstock of biochar 11 13 in addition plants in cws e g arundo donax cattail could absorb nitrogen and phosphorus by their roots to remove pollutants from wastewater which could be harvested and manufactured into biochar and reused as functional substrates in cws to realize the conversion from plant waste to bio resource 7 14 other plants like alder 15 gliricidia 16 acacia auriculiformis 17 coconut shell 18 or agricultural wastes 10 were also made into biochar and applied in cws so far biochar applied in cws are mainly manufactured from terrestrial macro plant due to their availability and high productivity considering the different properties of various biomass 19 20 the performance of biochar from marine life e g macroalgae or sewage sludge may have relatively high difference from terrestrial plant which should be explored in further studies 2 2 preparation of biochar biochar in cws was commonly prepared by pyrolysis 30 33 pyrolysis is a thermochemical decomposition procedure during which biomass is heated at varied temperature in the absence of oxygen the pyrolysis temperature typically ranged from 250 c to 1000 c among which 300 c and 500 c were the most frequently used table 1 7 22 34 the pyrolysis temperature was gradually raised with a rate of 10 c min until reaching the set temperature e g 500 c and maintained at the maximum temperature for 2 10 h 7 21 24 temperature and time of pyrolysis determine biochar properties e g ph carbon content porosity 35 36 and the subsequent performance in wastewater treatment 37 39 it was found that biochar production decreased from 42 9 to 19 6 but the adsorption ability for crystal violet dye increased with pyrolysis temperature increasing from 300 c to 900 c 40 sludge based biochar showed the best ammonia adsorption with 400 c pyrolysis and too low 350 c or high 550 c pyrolysis temperature was not good for biochar s adsorption ability 41 the influences of pyrolysis temperature on biochar s performance in pollutant adsorption were not consistent among studies 41 43 besides dry pyrolysis there are two producing systems for biochar production as well including hydrothermal combustion htc and gasification gas 44 45 biochar produced by different procedures may perform differently however the biochar produced by htc or gas has not been applied in cws biochar modification could change the chemical property of biochar and enhance its adsorption ability 46 alkali pretreatment and activation are the most modification methods zhao et al reported that the improved ratios of ammonia adsorption by biochar were 12 to 33 when the biochar was prepared at 500 c after the mild alkali pretreatment due to ion exchange 47 fe modified biochar s performance on pollutant removal were also studied by some papers 13 48 with fe modified biochar cw could achieve 85 tn removal with the hydraulic retention time of 3 d 13 80 of tp from the actual agricultural wastewater could be removal with fe modified biochar 48 moreover in addition to substrate adsorption cws purified wastewater through complex functions of plant absorbance and microbial metabolism which may also be influenced by different kinds of biochar addition 13 49 hence how biochar produced by different pyrolysis procedures affects the performance of cws need systematical investigation 2 3 property of biochar pore size chemical composition functional groups and surface area of biochar were the properties that people firstly concerned 50 51 the average pore size of biochar was determined by scanning electron microscope sem which was up to 10 0 μm according to kuno and feng s study 12 15 carbon c was the main composition of biochar ranging from 50 0 to 90 0 followed by oxygen o 12 15 52 in kasak s study c element occupied 86 7 of biochar which was the highest among the studies 15 biochar had a relatively high surface area of several hundred m2 g commonly 16 22 while it could also be as small as tens m2 g in other studies 38 53 in abedi s study the bet surface area of biochar was 809 m2 g much higher than that of zeolite with only 38 0 m2 g 10 carbon content porosity and surface area of biochar all showed an increasing trend with increasing pyrolysis temperature while the bio assimilation showed the opposite trend it was reported that the carbon percentage in biochar increased from 57 8 to 63 2 with pyrolysis temperature increasing from 300 c to 500 c while the bet surface area increased more than one magnitude dramatically from 10 0 m2 g to 281 m2 g 52 it could be demonstrated that the surface area property was more sensitive to temperature change compared with the carbon percentage the properties of biochar will likely influence its function in cws and will be discussed in the next section 3 the mechanisms of improved wastewater purification by biochar addition in cws biochar was commonly mixed with other substrate with a certain ratio 5 100 table 1 when applied in cws biochar could enhance the performance of cws in wastewater purification directly biochar has high surface area which benefits the absorbance of various pollutants 54 55 at the meantime biochar could also enhance the pollutant removal indirectly through influencing the characteristics of substrate microbe and plant growth in cws for example biochar provides large area for microbe to adhere and form biofilm and enhances the biological pollutant removal subsequently biochar could absorb pollutants e g phosphorus and ammonia initially and slowly release them and other chemicals for plant growth which extends the contact time between plant root and wastewater all the potential functions of biochar in cw systems are reviewed as follows and in fig 2 3 1 the direct adsorption of pollutants by biochar biochar could adsorb pollutants e g ammonia nitrate phosphorus antibiotics due to its large surface area and negative charge 56 58 the strong intermolecular π bones hydrogen bonding and electrostatic attraction were demonstrated to be the main reasons for high adsorption of pollutant to biochar 11 59 ammonia adsorption capacity of biochar ranged from several to tens mg g 20 60 which could be enhanced by biochar modification and the increasing ammonia concentration biochar from sorghum distillers grain could adsorb ammonia with a capacity of 2 06 mg g naoh activated biochar showed a larger surface area and more functional groups increasing the ammonia adsorption by 2 93 times 37 biochar from rice straw had an ammonia adsorption capacity of 0 97 2 84 mg g which could be increased to 15 0 mg g with the increase in initial ammonia concentrations from 50 0 mg l to 400 mg l 61 biochar showed different adsorption efficiency for different ions the adsorption efficiency for nitrate was higher than 80 0 while it was only 30 0 40 0 for ammonia with biochar from grape pip grape skin pine wood among others 20 biochar from activated sludge was reported to have a phosphorus adsorption capacity of 2 50 mg g with the surface area of 16 6 m2 g 38 with fe modification biochar achieved better nitrogen and phosphorus removal especially for phosphorus the phosphorus removal rate increased from 5 00 to 90 0 with fe dosage increasing from 0 to 10 0 due to the strong binding between fe and phosphorus ions 48 it could be concluded that biochar s adsorption capability varied with the feedstock types pollutant types and concentrations 62 63 and may be improved by modification with acid alkali metal ions 36 64 65 biochar showed limited pollutant adsorption capability when biochar was not modified or the pollutant concentration in the influent was low moreover the biochar would get saturated with continuous pollutant import in one system however the biological degradation or assimilation could consume the pollutant on the surface of biochar in cws hence biochar could spare sites for sustainable pollutant adsorption and extend its function time in cws 3 2 influence of biochar on substrate characteristics biochar was widely studied as soil amendment to improve the porosity and the water holding capacity of soil 66 in alotaibi s study the retained water content increased from 22 5 to almost 50 0 by biochar addition likely due to its porosity and hydrophilic oxygen containing functional groups 67 it was reported that the moisture of a storm water bio retention system increased significantly from 14 0 to 22 0 after biochar addition 68 no matter soil or the bio retention system they both share similar property to a vertical flow subsurface constructed wetland vfsscw which is filled with particulates and in the atmosphere with a certain moisture vfsscw had a great oxygenation ability owing to the unsaturated status of substrate i e not submerged in water however the commonly used substrate e g gravel has a smooth surface and only provides little time for the contact between water and biofilm on the substrate surface when wastewater flows through the surface fast from this aspect biochar addition in vfsscw could extend the retention time of wastewater in the system and enhance the microbial digestion of pollutants subsequently 69 for the system with saturated substrate i e submerged in water the hydraulic conductivity increased from 7 00 cm h to 9 50 cm h after adding 4 00 biochar 70 with 20 0 biochar addition substrate i e soil s saturated hydraulic conductivity increased from 2 12 cm h to approximately 10 0 cm h 71 the relatively larger diameter of biochar than substrate soil or sand was demonstrated to be the reason for better hydraulic conductivity 71 it could be speculated that cws with sand substrate small particulates could suffer from a relatively high hydraulic load with biochar addition moreover hydraulic conductivity of cws decreases with running time owing to substrate clogging when the actual hydraulic conductivity decreases below the hydraulic load a congestion would form in cws which may be mitigated by initial biochar addition however it remains unclear whether or not biochar could increase the hydraulic conductivity in the cws with the substrate of large particulates e g fine gravel 3 3 influence of biochar on water conditions biochar could release dissolved organic matters doms into the environment according to li s study biochar released doms into water with a fast rate in the first 10 h then this procedure slowed down and reached a mass balance between biochar and water during a batch experiment the amount of fast released doms increased from 6 01 to 126 mg l with pyrolysis temperature decreasing from 600 c to 300 c and this part of doms had high biological assimilability 52 if the fast released bioavailable doms was intended to be the carbon source of microbe it would not contribute much during a long term operation of cws because this procedure only lasted for the initial hours after biochar added then the release of doms would slow down besides releasing doms biochar could also affect the ph of water 22 in zhou s study ph of the effluent from biochar added cw was around 8 1 while the ph of the effluent from non biochar cw was only 7 63 72 according to theoretical calculation nitrification denitrification process is an acid produce process the addition of biochar in cws could thus neutralize the produced acid and eliminate the inhibition of nitrification by acid cws with biochar addition have a relatively high dissolved oxygen do concentration 73 do in cws without biochar was 3 50 mg l while it increased by 21 4 and 25 7 with the addition of rice husk biochar and wood biochar respectively 19 in another study a relatively better oxygenation was obtained in biochar added cws under the intermittent aeration condition compared with non biochar cws 12 likely because biochar has a better adsorption capability for the aerated oxygen than common substrate and can extend the retention time of oxygen in the system the similar situation happened for tidal cws biochar could adsorb more oxygen than common substrate e g gravel during the drain phase and bring more oxygen for pollutant removal at the beginning of flood phase 3 4 influence of biochar on microbial growth and behavior owing to the porous structure biochar could create various micro habitats with different hydraulic and physicochemical conditions compared with the bulk liquid phase 16 the inner pores suffered from a relatively low hydraulic scour compared with the substrate surface additionally the released materials from biochar the pollutants and dissolved oxygen from wastewater could all transport in biofilm forming a gradient changing micro environment along the depth direction of biofilm 74 therefore a thick biofilm on the surface of biochar could hold abundant microbes denitrification and other anaerobic microorganisms in the inner layer of the biofilm and aerobic microbes in the surface layer 19 75 it was proved that nirs denitrifier in biochar added cw was 674 outs 115 higher than that in non biochar cw 76 biochar addition was widely reported to increase the microbial abundance and diversity in cws 34 77 78 out number increased from 664 to 732 after 30 0 biochar addition in cws and the relative abundance of nitrifier nitrosomonas and nitrospira also increased simultaneously 79 the diversity of microbial community in terms of shannon index increased from 7 54 to 7 81 with 20 biochar addition 22 biochar was demonstrated to act as a slow release organic carbon source for the denitrification process particularly when applied in wastewater with low c n ratios 14 75 80 in addition to the possibility of biochar as an organic carbon source biochar could function as an electric conductor transfer electrons between donors and acceptors for microbial nitrate reduction and accelerate the biological pollutant removal rate 81 however some opposite opinions were also reported although the carbon released from biochar could be used for denitrification the amount was limited 82 it might also be difficult for microbes to digest the released carbon from biochar given that biochar was usually produced at high temperatures and consisted of aromatic carbon rings 83 biochar could also rapidly adsorb ammonia from water and slowly release it to the nitrifying bacteria biochar adsorption extend the contact time between ammonia and oxygen which showed advantages in ammonia removal when insufficient oxygen became a limiting factor 12 biochar could also absorb organic carbons from wastewater and slow release them for denitrifies which was proved by the increasing doc from aged biochar 23 for some slow biodegradable materials biochar absorbance extends the retention time of those molecules and enhances the subsequent microbial pollutant interaction process 3 5 influence of biochar on plant growth biochar addition affected the physicochemical conditions in cws e g hydraulic conductivity do ph which enhanced the nutrient absorbance by plant root 14 19 biochar with microbes at the rhizosphere of plant could help plant root to fulfil its function 84 86 biochar could also release material and affect plant growth directly as a result of the above function of biochar addition in cws nitrogen content of phragmites australis was significantly increased from 1 40 mg g to 1 95 mg g by adding wood biochar 19 in kasak s study nitrogen uptake by plant increased from 40 7 g m2 to 78 1 g m2 by biochar addition 15 phosphorus uptake was also improved by biochar in cws the contributions of nitrogen and phosphorus removal by plant in biochar added cw were 15 4 and 14 2 respectively while they were just 8 00 and 8 30 in cw without biochar 15 in addition the enhanced release of plant derived carbon after biochar addition was thought more important for denitrification in cws than the direct released carbon from biochar as the biochar derived carbon was limited and difficult to be used in the denitrification process 15 19 therefore multiple processes occur simultaneously after biochar addition in cws for wastewater treatment through direct and indirect interactions fig 2 which reflected the complicated effects of biochar in cws 4 biochar addition affected the performance of pollutant removal in cws chemical oxygen demand cod total nitrogen tn ammonia nh4 n and total phosphorus tp are the main parameters for pollutants that people are concerned in wastewater treatment the comparison of pollutant removal in cws with without biochar addition figs 3 and 4 are reviewed and summarized the x value of each point in fig 4 stands for the pollutant removal efficiency in biochar added cw and the corresponding y value stands for the pollutant removal efficiency in cws without biochar addition under the same operation condition from the same study points at the lower right area shown as the light green area in fig 4a indicate that biochar addition improves the pollutant removal fig 4 also provides information about the effects of influent pollutant contents and aerobic condition on pollutant removal the oxygen supply ability gradually decreases by the order of aeration tidal operation batch operation and non aeration 4 1 biochar addition enhanced cod removal in cws based on 92 groups of data from 25 references cod removal efficiency ranged from 45 0 to 98 0 in all the biochar added cws and non biochar cws however the median values of cod removal efficiency were 85 0 in biochar added cws and 78 0 in none biochar cws respectively fig 3 moreover most of the points in fig 4a distributes at the lower right area indicating that biochar addition in cws enhanced cod removal as reported in most studies however some points at the dash line of y x suggest no superior effects of biochar addition on cod removal three possible pathways were considered regarding the effects of biochar addition on cod removal 1 biochar could release organic carbons into wastewater act as a source of cod and reduce cod removal efficiency 2 biochar could absorb cod from wastewater for its high surface area 3 biochar could increase do level and the abundance of heterotrophic microbe thereby enhancing cod removal 7 as shown in fig 4a it was obvious that the positive effects of biochar addition on cod removal were dominant over the negative effects in most studies fig 4a also provides information about the effects of influent cod concentration and aerobic condition on cod removal commonly high initial pollutant concentration could lead to a relatively low removal efficiency under a certain condition theoretically however the points with different colors in fig 4a which indicate different influent cod concentrations do not show an organized distribution suggesting that influent cod concentration was not the primary influencing factor in cod removal some cws with influent cod concentrations above 500 mg l still got a removal efficiency above 90 0 72 aerobic condition benefits for cod removal therefore the relatively low cod removal was achieved under batch operation or non aeration condition fig 4a moreover the points deviating far from the dash line of y x in grey ellipse in fig 4a all had high influent cod concentrations above 150 mg l and are under non aeration condition in other words biochar added cws showed their advantage of improving cod removal than non biochar cws especially when the conditions were not good for cod degradation it could be explained that non biochar cws could not perform well in cod removal when the influent cod concentration was high and oxygen was insufficient for cod degradation while the addition of biochar could adsorb cod directly adsorb dissolved oxygen and extent oxygen retention time for cod degradation indirectly resulting in a better cod removal with biochar addition in cws cod removal could be improved from 58 0 to 77 8 at a high influent cod concentration of 616 mg l 11 4 2 biochar addition enhanced ammonia removal in cws the median of ammonia removal in biochar added cws was 79 4 which was only 54 9 in non biochar cws fig 3 most points in fig 4d were located below the dash line of y x indicating that biochar improved ammonia removal in cws fig 4d also gave the information of influent ammonia concentration and aerobic condition influence on ammonia removal some cws with high ammonia load showed 90 0 removal efficiency suggesting that the influent ammonia concentration did not show positive correlation with the removal efficiency four regions were artificially divided according to the oxygenation methods as shown in fig 4d it was found that the ammonia oxidation efficiency followed the same order as the oxygen supply ability with aeration the removal of ammonia could be above 90 region 4 in fig 4d tidal operation and batch operation both provided the cw systems with an intermittent oxygenation process before wastewater entered hence the ammonia removal efficiency under tidal operation and batch operation region 2 3 in fig 4d was lower than those under aeration but better than those under non aeration condition region 1 in fig 4d moreover points at region 1 3 especially region 1 deviated from the dash line of y x while points at region 4 distributed around the dash line indicating that biochar significantly improved the oxygenation and the subsequent ammonia oxidation under non aeration condition p 0 05 under non aeration condition biochar added cw could obtain 90 0 ammonia removal while the none biochar cw only obtained 16 7 ammonia removal 13 this could be explained in section 3 3 that biochar addition in cws enhanced the oxygen retention in the system and the subsequent ammonia oxidation under none extra oxygen supplement condition however in aerated cws non biochar cws could also realize a good ammonia removal above 80 0 where oxygen was not a limit factor for ammonia removal hence the oxygen adsorption ability of biochar in biochar added cws could not help to enhance ammonia removal significantly under aeration condition 4 3 biochar addition enhanced tn removal in cws the median of tn removal in biochar added cws and non biochar cws were 68 1 and 38 3 respectively fig 3 all the points in fig 4c located in the lower right region and are farther away from the dash line of y x demonstrating that biochar addition could enhance tn removal relatively significant than cod removal some points in fig 4a were around the dash line of y x moreover tn removal was strongly enhanced by biochar addition under non aeration condition supporting by the points locating in the grey circle far from dash line of y x in fig 4c tn removal could be as high as 80 0 with biochar addition under non aeration condition while it was only 20 0 in the blank control cws shown in the grey ellipse in fig 4c the tn removal is related to the ammonia removal as nitrification and denitrification processes are the main pathway for total nitrogen removal under non aeration condition biochar addition could keep the cw systems at a relatively higher aerobic condition compared with the cws without biochar 19 and enhance the ammonia oxidation which provides more reactant i e nitrate for the denitrification process organic carbon is essential for denitrification process hence cws with a high influent c n ratio obtained a relatively high tn removal shown in the red circle in fig 4c 22 79 biochar could bring different carbon sources according to the literatures 1 biochar could release organic carbon itself 52 2 biochar could absorb cod from influent and slowly release it for microbial metabolism 23 3 biochar could enhance plant growth and accelerate the organic carbon release from plant root 15 based on theoretical calculations 160 mg cod would be consumed for 56 0 mg nitrogen denitrification assuming all the influent cod absorbed by biochar was used for denitrification it was insufficient to support the extra tn removal in biochar added cws 72 79 88 hence the enhancement on tn removal by providing organic carbon must be a combined result of the direct release from biochar and the indirect release of absorbed cod from wastewater or organic carbon from plant roots however which one is dominant under what kinds of situation needs further investigation 4 4 biochar addition influenced tp removal in cws based on 40 groups of tp removal data the median of tp removal in biochar added cw was 60 7 and it was 65 0 in none biochar cws fig 3 actually the data about biochar added cws for tp removal was limited compared to nitrogen removal all the points located at the upper right area came from the studies with sand as substrate in cws with common substrate filled e g fine gravel biochar addition could enhance phosphorus adsorption as substrate absorbance was the main pathway for tp removal in cws 90 91 it was deduced that if the original substrate could not adsorb phosphorus as well as biochar the addition of biochar could enhance tp removal of cws similar to biochar other materials with small diameter or special compositions also had a great capability for tp adsorption 92 93 for example cw with sand as substrate showed better tp removal than the cw with sand and biochar as mixed substrate shown as the points above the line of y x in fig 4b 24 owing to the smaller size of sand however whether biochar or other substrate the adsorption of pollutant could get saturated in the future without continuous biological metabolism 5 biochar addition reduced ghg emission in cws during the wastewater treatment process in cws ghg e g n2o co2 and ch4 could be produced and released into air along with carbon and nitrogen transformations by microbe and plants it was reported that aerobic condition benefit for ch4 oxidation 34 biochar could adjust do ph the growth of microbe and plant influencing the ghg emission subsequently 34 72 it was commonly observed that biochar addition could decrease the n2o emission in soil 94 96 although there were not sufficient studies in the effects of biochar addition on ghg emission in cws similar conclusion was reached according to the summarized data in table 2 it was reported that the n2o emission rate reduced from 113 μg m2 h to 75 0 μg m2 h with biochar addition as substrate in cws 34 significant decrease in n2o emission 30 70 in cws by biochar addition was also found in other studies 7 79 in addition the n2o emission decreased with the increase in c n ratios and supplement of oxygen 7 34 likely due to the do increase by biochar addition that accelerates the transformation of no2 n 79 no2 n was demonstrated to be one of the sources for n2o emission besides n2o co2 and ch4 were also reported the phenomenon that co2 emission decreased while ch4 emission increased after biochar addition in wetlands was reported 7 97 biochar enhanced plant grow and lead to a better co2 fixation in cws 98 biochar was one kind of conductive material which benefited for the electron transfer during the ch4 production by methanogens 97 however the opposite conclusions were drawn by other researchers in a cw kind wastewater treatment bioreactor n2o and co2 emission was enhanced with 30 biochar addition 99 biochar addition in cws decreased ch4 emission in ji s study 34 taken together inconsistent trends of n2o and ch4 emission affected by biochar application were reported between cw studies the mechanism about ghg emission influenced by biochar addition in cws needs further exploration 6 the existing problems during the biochar application in cws 6 1 potential substance release biochar could release nitrogen phosphorus salt alkaline et al these substance release may have negative impacts on the water purification moreover during the production of biochar some toxic material e g benzene series polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs could form simultaneously or be imported from the feedstock e g plants from cws may absorb pahs from wastewater 100 pahs in sewage sludge derived biochar were 600 800 μg kg which could be a pollutant source when applied in environmental amendment 101 besides pahs waste biomass derived biochar could also be a potential source of heavy metal 102 the biological and ecological safety may be threatened during the biochar application in environment media which should be evaluated in advance 6 2 blocks for scale up application although biochar addition in cws could enhance the cod ammonia and tn removal the production cost of biochar was relatively high by the traditional pyrolysis method due to the high temperature and anaerobic condition required many studies have been conducted to reduce the cost of biochar production e g through adjusting the parameters producing biochar e g temperature or procedure time 40 or using microwave steam as a heat source owing to the high efficiency and low energy consumption 103 104 secondly biochar has a light density which may float on the surface when applying in a surface flow cw therefore it should be fix with mesh material before applied 6 3 unclear mechanisms cw system purifies wastewater through the inter functions of plant substrate and microbes the addition of biochar affects plant growth microbial metabolism and substrate property from many aspects however there is a lack of systematic and quantified explanation about the exact mechanisms of the effects of biochar addition in cw systems which involves a multi phase chemical biological process for example biochar could release chemicals into the cw system which may be digested by some microbes inhibit the growth of others or influence plant root absorbance behavior as signal molecular simultaneously though it is known that cod removal was enhanced the quantified influences on microbe or plant are still unclear 7 conclusion the sources and preparation determine biochar s properties and the subsequent influence on cw performance the optimal material and manufacture parameter for biochar production are still not studied systematically biochar addition could improve cod ammonia and tn removal in cws with the enhancement effect more significant under non aeration condition biochar addition in cw systems enhanced pollutant removal by different pathways i e substrate microbe and plant while the quantified contribution from each pathway to the enhancement of pollutant removal needs further investigation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

13217,biochar is considered as black gold in environmental remediation field due to its high surface area light density great adsorption capacity biochar has high potential to improve the wastewater purification in constructed wetlands cws which has been increasingly investigated in this decade this paper reviews the characteristics of biochar methods of preparation pollutant removal effects and the greenhouse gas ghg emission reduction in cws systematically which could guide further studies of biochar application in cws it was found that the biochar applied in cws were mainly produced by pyrolysis of terrestrial plants while the biochar produced from marine biology or by other procedures may have different performance due to the various properties which needed further investigation biochar affected cw performance through multiple pathways including influencing the physicochemical hydraulic conditions and biological behavior in cws the quantified enhancement of pollutant removal by biochar addition in cws was firstly summarized research data proved that medians of cod ammonia and tn removal in biochar added cws were 109 145 and 178 as much as those in non biochar cws respectively moreover the most significant improvement showed under oxygen shortage condition in cws rather than aeration condition however it remains unclear which pathway dominates the enhanced pollutant removal besides biochar commonly decreased n2o emission from cws while the opposite results were also reported and a comprehensive explanation has not been reached therefore future mechanism studies are needed to advance our understanding on biochar s behavior in cws for wastewater treatment abbreviations ghg greenhouse gas cw constructed wetland keywords biochar constructed wetland greenhouse gas emission nitrogen removal wastewater treatment 1 introduction biochar was applied in many kinds of soil amendment 1 3 and wastewater treatment systems 4 5 in this decade due to its high surface area light density great adsorption capacity 6 and the potential to decrease greenhouse gas ghg emission 7 based on searches in databases in the web of science the application of biochar in wastewater treatment started several years later than in soil amendment fig 1 about 2000 papers discussed biochar application in wastewater treatment among which several dozens of sci papers focused on its application in constructed wetland cw constructed wetland treatment system 8 specifically engineered to purify wastewater consisted of substrate microbes and plants 9 cws could be further classified into free water surface and horizontal or vertical subsurface systems according to wetland hydrology 10 all the papers about biochar application in cws were published in the recent 5 years indicating it is a study hotspot as a popular material applied in environment a systematical summary of biochar s function in cws is needed hence this paper discussed the characteristics of biochar its mechanism and function in constructed wetlands cws the enhanced performance of wastewater purification in cws and the ghg emission in cws influenced by biochar which could guide further studies of biochar application in cws 2 the characteristics of biochar applied in constructed wetlands 2 1 source of biochar biochar has many sources which could be divided into four categories i e agricultural wastes and wood food wastes marine feedstocks and sewage sludges shown in table 1 during the application in cws agricultural wastes and wood derived biochar were widely applied among which bamboo was popular as a feedstock of biochar 11 13 in addition plants in cws e g arundo donax cattail could absorb nitrogen and phosphorus by their roots to remove pollutants from wastewater which could be harvested and manufactured into biochar and reused as functional substrates in cws to realize the conversion from plant waste to bio resource 7 14 other plants like alder 15 gliricidia 16 acacia auriculiformis 17 coconut shell 18 or agricultural wastes 10 were also made into biochar and applied in cws so far biochar applied in cws are mainly manufactured from terrestrial macro plant due to their availability and high productivity considering the different properties of various biomass 19 20 the performance of biochar from marine life e g macroalgae or sewage sludge may have relatively high difference from terrestrial plant which should be explored in further studies 2 2 preparation of biochar biochar in cws was commonly prepared by pyrolysis 30 33 pyrolysis is a thermochemical decomposition procedure during which biomass is heated at varied temperature in the absence of oxygen the pyrolysis temperature typically ranged from 250 c to 1000 c among which 300 c and 500 c were the most frequently used table 1 7 22 34 the pyrolysis temperature was gradually raised with a rate of 10 c min until reaching the set temperature e g 500 c and maintained at the maximum temperature for 2 10 h 7 21 24 temperature and time of pyrolysis determine biochar properties e g ph carbon content porosity 35 36 and the subsequent performance in wastewater treatment 37 39 it was found that biochar production decreased from 42 9 to 19 6 but the adsorption ability for crystal violet dye increased with pyrolysis temperature increasing from 300 c to 900 c 40 sludge based biochar showed the best ammonia adsorption with 400 c pyrolysis and too low 350 c or high 550 c pyrolysis temperature was not good for biochar s adsorption ability 41 the influences of pyrolysis temperature on biochar s performance in pollutant adsorption were not consistent among studies 41 43 besides dry pyrolysis there are two producing systems for biochar production as well including hydrothermal combustion htc and gasification gas 44 45 biochar produced by different procedures may perform differently however the biochar produced by htc or gas has not been applied in cws biochar modification could change the chemical property of biochar and enhance its adsorption ability 46 alkali pretreatment and activation are the most modification methods zhao et al reported that the improved ratios of ammonia adsorption by biochar were 12 to 33 when the biochar was prepared at 500 c after the mild alkali pretreatment due to ion exchange 47 fe modified biochar s performance on pollutant removal were also studied by some papers 13 48 with fe modified biochar cw could achieve 85 tn removal with the hydraulic retention time of 3 d 13 80 of tp from the actual agricultural wastewater could be removal with fe modified biochar 48 moreover in addition to substrate adsorption cws purified wastewater through complex functions of plant absorbance and microbial metabolism which may also be influenced by different kinds of biochar addition 13 49 hence how biochar produced by different pyrolysis procedures affects the performance of cws need systematical investigation 2 3 property of biochar pore size chemical composition functional groups and surface area of biochar were the properties that people firstly concerned 50 51 the average pore size of biochar was determined by scanning electron microscope sem which was up to 10 0 μm according to kuno and feng s study 12 15 carbon c was the main composition of biochar ranging from 50 0 to 90 0 followed by oxygen o 12 15 52 in kasak s study c element occupied 86 7 of biochar which was the highest among the studies 15 biochar had a relatively high surface area of several hundred m2 g commonly 16 22 while it could also be as small as tens m2 g in other studies 38 53 in abedi s study the bet surface area of biochar was 809 m2 g much higher than that of zeolite with only 38 0 m2 g 10 carbon content porosity and surface area of biochar all showed an increasing trend with increasing pyrolysis temperature while the bio assimilation showed the opposite trend it was reported that the carbon percentage in biochar increased from 57 8 to 63 2 with pyrolysis temperature increasing from 300 c to 500 c while the bet surface area increased more than one magnitude dramatically from 10 0 m2 g to 281 m2 g 52 it could be demonstrated that the surface area property was more sensitive to temperature change compared with the carbon percentage the properties of biochar will likely influence its function in cws and will be discussed in the next section 3 the mechanisms of improved wastewater purification by biochar addition in cws biochar was commonly mixed with other substrate with a certain ratio 5 100 table 1 when applied in cws biochar could enhance the performance of cws in wastewater purification directly biochar has high surface area which benefits the absorbance of various pollutants 54 55 at the meantime biochar could also enhance the pollutant removal indirectly through influencing the characteristics of substrate microbe and plant growth in cws for example biochar provides large area for microbe to adhere and form biofilm and enhances the biological pollutant removal subsequently biochar could absorb pollutants e g phosphorus and ammonia initially and slowly release them and other chemicals for plant growth which extends the contact time between plant root and wastewater all the potential functions of biochar in cw systems are reviewed as follows and in fig 2 3 1 the direct adsorption of pollutants by biochar biochar could adsorb pollutants e g ammonia nitrate phosphorus antibiotics due to its large surface area and negative charge 56 58 the strong intermolecular π bones hydrogen bonding and electrostatic attraction were demonstrated to be the main reasons for high adsorption of pollutant to biochar 11 59 ammonia adsorption capacity of biochar ranged from several to tens mg g 20 60 which could be enhanced by biochar modification and the increasing ammonia concentration biochar from sorghum distillers grain could adsorb ammonia with a capacity of 2 06 mg g naoh activated biochar showed a larger surface area and more functional groups increasing the ammonia adsorption by 2 93 times 37 biochar from rice straw had an ammonia adsorption capacity of 0 97 2 84 mg g which could be increased to 15 0 mg g with the increase in initial ammonia concentrations from 50 0 mg l to 400 mg l 61 biochar showed different adsorption efficiency for different ions the adsorption efficiency for nitrate was higher than 80 0 while it was only 30 0 40 0 for ammonia with biochar from grape pip grape skin pine wood among others 20 biochar from activated sludge was reported to have a phosphorus adsorption capacity of 2 50 mg g with the surface area of 16 6 m2 g 38 with fe modification biochar achieved better nitrogen and phosphorus removal especially for phosphorus the phosphorus removal rate increased from 5 00 to 90 0 with fe dosage increasing from 0 to 10 0 due to the strong binding between fe and phosphorus ions 48 it could be concluded that biochar s adsorption capability varied with the feedstock types pollutant types and concentrations 62 63 and may be improved by modification with acid alkali metal ions 36 64 65 biochar showed limited pollutant adsorption capability when biochar was not modified or the pollutant concentration in the influent was low moreover the biochar would get saturated with continuous pollutant import in one system however the biological degradation or assimilation could consume the pollutant on the surface of biochar in cws hence biochar could spare sites for sustainable pollutant adsorption and extend its function time in cws 3 2 influence of biochar on substrate characteristics biochar was widely studied as soil amendment to improve the porosity and the water holding capacity of soil 66 in alotaibi s study the retained water content increased from 22 5 to almost 50 0 by biochar addition likely due to its porosity and hydrophilic oxygen containing functional groups 67 it was reported that the moisture of a storm water bio retention system increased significantly from 14 0 to 22 0 after biochar addition 68 no matter soil or the bio retention system they both share similar property to a vertical flow subsurface constructed wetland vfsscw which is filled with particulates and in the atmosphere with a certain moisture vfsscw had a great oxygenation ability owing to the unsaturated status of substrate i e not submerged in water however the commonly used substrate e g gravel has a smooth surface and only provides little time for the contact between water and biofilm on the substrate surface when wastewater flows through the surface fast from this aspect biochar addition in vfsscw could extend the retention time of wastewater in the system and enhance the microbial digestion of pollutants subsequently 69 for the system with saturated substrate i e submerged in water the hydraulic conductivity increased from 7 00 cm h to 9 50 cm h after adding 4 00 biochar 70 with 20 0 biochar addition substrate i e soil s saturated hydraulic conductivity increased from 2 12 cm h to approximately 10 0 cm h 71 the relatively larger diameter of biochar than substrate soil or sand was demonstrated to be the reason for better hydraulic conductivity 71 it could be speculated that cws with sand substrate small particulates could suffer from a relatively high hydraulic load with biochar addition moreover hydraulic conductivity of cws decreases with running time owing to substrate clogging when the actual hydraulic conductivity decreases below the hydraulic load a congestion would form in cws which may be mitigated by initial biochar addition however it remains unclear whether or not biochar could increase the hydraulic conductivity in the cws with the substrate of large particulates e g fine gravel 3 3 influence of biochar on water conditions biochar could release dissolved organic matters doms into the environment according to li s study biochar released doms into water with a fast rate in the first 10 h then this procedure slowed down and reached a mass balance between biochar and water during a batch experiment the amount of fast released doms increased from 6 01 to 126 mg l with pyrolysis temperature decreasing from 600 c to 300 c and this part of doms had high biological assimilability 52 if the fast released bioavailable doms was intended to be the carbon source of microbe it would not contribute much during a long term operation of cws because this procedure only lasted for the initial hours after biochar added then the release of doms would slow down besides releasing doms biochar could also affect the ph of water 22 in zhou s study ph of the effluent from biochar added cw was around 8 1 while the ph of the effluent from non biochar cw was only 7 63 72 according to theoretical calculation nitrification denitrification process is an acid produce process the addition of biochar in cws could thus neutralize the produced acid and eliminate the inhibition of nitrification by acid cws with biochar addition have a relatively high dissolved oxygen do concentration 73 do in cws without biochar was 3 50 mg l while it increased by 21 4 and 25 7 with the addition of rice husk biochar and wood biochar respectively 19 in another study a relatively better oxygenation was obtained in biochar added cws under the intermittent aeration condition compared with non biochar cws 12 likely because biochar has a better adsorption capability for the aerated oxygen than common substrate and can extend the retention time of oxygen in the system the similar situation happened for tidal cws biochar could adsorb more oxygen than common substrate e g gravel during the drain phase and bring more oxygen for pollutant removal at the beginning of flood phase 3 4 influence of biochar on microbial growth and behavior owing to the porous structure biochar could create various micro habitats with different hydraulic and physicochemical conditions compared with the bulk liquid phase 16 the inner pores suffered from a relatively low hydraulic scour compared with the substrate surface additionally the released materials from biochar the pollutants and dissolved oxygen from wastewater could all transport in biofilm forming a gradient changing micro environment along the depth direction of biofilm 74 therefore a thick biofilm on the surface of biochar could hold abundant microbes denitrification and other anaerobic microorganisms in the inner layer of the biofilm and aerobic microbes in the surface layer 19 75 it was proved that nirs denitrifier in biochar added cw was 674 outs 115 higher than that in non biochar cw 76 biochar addition was widely reported to increase the microbial abundance and diversity in cws 34 77 78 out number increased from 664 to 732 after 30 0 biochar addition in cws and the relative abundance of nitrifier nitrosomonas and nitrospira also increased simultaneously 79 the diversity of microbial community in terms of shannon index increased from 7 54 to 7 81 with 20 biochar addition 22 biochar was demonstrated to act as a slow release organic carbon source for the denitrification process particularly when applied in wastewater with low c n ratios 14 75 80 in addition to the possibility of biochar as an organic carbon source biochar could function as an electric conductor transfer electrons between donors and acceptors for microbial nitrate reduction and accelerate the biological pollutant removal rate 81 however some opposite opinions were also reported although the carbon released from biochar could be used for denitrification the amount was limited 82 it might also be difficult for microbes to digest the released carbon from biochar given that biochar was usually produced at high temperatures and consisted of aromatic carbon rings 83 biochar could also rapidly adsorb ammonia from water and slowly release it to the nitrifying bacteria biochar adsorption extend the contact time between ammonia and oxygen which showed advantages in ammonia removal when insufficient oxygen became a limiting factor 12 biochar could also absorb organic carbons from wastewater and slow release them for denitrifies which was proved by the increasing doc from aged biochar 23 for some slow biodegradable materials biochar absorbance extends the retention time of those molecules and enhances the subsequent microbial pollutant interaction process 3 5 influence of biochar on plant growth biochar addition affected the physicochemical conditions in cws e g hydraulic conductivity do ph which enhanced the nutrient absorbance by plant root 14 19 biochar with microbes at the rhizosphere of plant could help plant root to fulfil its function 84 86 biochar could also release material and affect plant growth directly as a result of the above function of biochar addition in cws nitrogen content of phragmites australis was significantly increased from 1 40 mg g to 1 95 mg g by adding wood biochar 19 in kasak s study nitrogen uptake by plant increased from 40 7 g m2 to 78 1 g m2 by biochar addition 15 phosphorus uptake was also improved by biochar in cws the contributions of nitrogen and phosphorus removal by plant in biochar added cw were 15 4 and 14 2 respectively while they were just 8 00 and 8 30 in cw without biochar 15 in addition the enhanced release of plant derived carbon after biochar addition was thought more important for denitrification in cws than the direct released carbon from biochar as the biochar derived carbon was limited and difficult to be used in the denitrification process 15 19 therefore multiple processes occur simultaneously after biochar addition in cws for wastewater treatment through direct and indirect interactions fig 2 which reflected the complicated effects of biochar in cws 4 biochar addition affected the performance of pollutant removal in cws chemical oxygen demand cod total nitrogen tn ammonia nh4 n and total phosphorus tp are the main parameters for pollutants that people are concerned in wastewater treatment the comparison of pollutant removal in cws with without biochar addition figs 3 and 4 are reviewed and summarized the x value of each point in fig 4 stands for the pollutant removal efficiency in biochar added cw and the corresponding y value stands for the pollutant removal efficiency in cws without biochar addition under the same operation condition from the same study points at the lower right area shown as the light green area in fig 4a indicate that biochar addition improves the pollutant removal fig 4 also provides information about the effects of influent pollutant contents and aerobic condition on pollutant removal the oxygen supply ability gradually decreases by the order of aeration tidal operation batch operation and non aeration 4 1 biochar addition enhanced cod removal in cws based on 92 groups of data from 25 references cod removal efficiency ranged from 45 0 to 98 0 in all the biochar added cws and non biochar cws however the median values of cod removal efficiency were 85 0 in biochar added cws and 78 0 in none biochar cws respectively fig 3 moreover most of the points in fig 4a distributes at the lower right area indicating that biochar addition in cws enhanced cod removal as reported in most studies however some points at the dash line of y x suggest no superior effects of biochar addition on cod removal three possible pathways were considered regarding the effects of biochar addition on cod removal 1 biochar could release organic carbons into wastewater act as a source of cod and reduce cod removal efficiency 2 biochar could absorb cod from wastewater for its high surface area 3 biochar could increase do level and the abundance of heterotrophic microbe thereby enhancing cod removal 7 as shown in fig 4a it was obvious that the positive effects of biochar addition on cod removal were dominant over the negative effects in most studies fig 4a also provides information about the effects of influent cod concentration and aerobic condition on cod removal commonly high initial pollutant concentration could lead to a relatively low removal efficiency under a certain condition theoretically however the points with different colors in fig 4a which indicate different influent cod concentrations do not show an organized distribution suggesting that influent cod concentration was not the primary influencing factor in cod removal some cws with influent cod concentrations above 500 mg l still got a removal efficiency above 90 0 72 aerobic condition benefits for cod removal therefore the relatively low cod removal was achieved under batch operation or non aeration condition fig 4a moreover the points deviating far from the dash line of y x in grey ellipse in fig 4a all had high influent cod concentrations above 150 mg l and are under non aeration condition in other words biochar added cws showed their advantage of improving cod removal than non biochar cws especially when the conditions were not good for cod degradation it could be explained that non biochar cws could not perform well in cod removal when the influent cod concentration was high and oxygen was insufficient for cod degradation while the addition of biochar could adsorb cod directly adsorb dissolved oxygen and extent oxygen retention time for cod degradation indirectly resulting in a better cod removal with biochar addition in cws cod removal could be improved from 58 0 to 77 8 at a high influent cod concentration of 616 mg l 11 4 2 biochar addition enhanced ammonia removal in cws the median of ammonia removal in biochar added cws was 79 4 which was only 54 9 in non biochar cws fig 3 most points in fig 4d were located below the dash line of y x indicating that biochar improved ammonia removal in cws fig 4d also gave the information of influent ammonia concentration and aerobic condition influence on ammonia removal some cws with high ammonia load showed 90 0 removal efficiency suggesting that the influent ammonia concentration did not show positive correlation with the removal efficiency four regions were artificially divided according to the oxygenation methods as shown in fig 4d it was found that the ammonia oxidation efficiency followed the same order as the oxygen supply ability with aeration the removal of ammonia could be above 90 region 4 in fig 4d tidal operation and batch operation both provided the cw systems with an intermittent oxygenation process before wastewater entered hence the ammonia removal efficiency under tidal operation and batch operation region 2 3 in fig 4d was lower than those under aeration but better than those under non aeration condition region 1 in fig 4d moreover points at region 1 3 especially region 1 deviated from the dash line of y x while points at region 4 distributed around the dash line indicating that biochar significantly improved the oxygenation and the subsequent ammonia oxidation under non aeration condition p 0 05 under non aeration condition biochar added cw could obtain 90 0 ammonia removal while the none biochar cw only obtained 16 7 ammonia removal 13 this could be explained in section 3 3 that biochar addition in cws enhanced the oxygen retention in the system and the subsequent ammonia oxidation under none extra oxygen supplement condition however in aerated cws non biochar cws could also realize a good ammonia removal above 80 0 where oxygen was not a limit factor for ammonia removal hence the oxygen adsorption ability of biochar in biochar added cws could not help to enhance ammonia removal significantly under aeration condition 4 3 biochar addition enhanced tn removal in cws the median of tn removal in biochar added cws and non biochar cws were 68 1 and 38 3 respectively fig 3 all the points in fig 4c located in the lower right region and are farther away from the dash line of y x demonstrating that biochar addition could enhance tn removal relatively significant than cod removal some points in fig 4a were around the dash line of y x moreover tn removal was strongly enhanced by biochar addition under non aeration condition supporting by the points locating in the grey circle far from dash line of y x in fig 4c tn removal could be as high as 80 0 with biochar addition under non aeration condition while it was only 20 0 in the blank control cws shown in the grey ellipse in fig 4c the tn removal is related to the ammonia removal as nitrification and denitrification processes are the main pathway for total nitrogen removal under non aeration condition biochar addition could keep the cw systems at a relatively higher aerobic condition compared with the cws without biochar 19 and enhance the ammonia oxidation which provides more reactant i e nitrate for the denitrification process organic carbon is essential for denitrification process hence cws with a high influent c n ratio obtained a relatively high tn removal shown in the red circle in fig 4c 22 79 biochar could bring different carbon sources according to the literatures 1 biochar could release organic carbon itself 52 2 biochar could absorb cod from influent and slowly release it for microbial metabolism 23 3 biochar could enhance plant growth and accelerate the organic carbon release from plant root 15 based on theoretical calculations 160 mg cod would be consumed for 56 0 mg nitrogen denitrification assuming all the influent cod absorbed by biochar was used for denitrification it was insufficient to support the extra tn removal in biochar added cws 72 79 88 hence the enhancement on tn removal by providing organic carbon must be a combined result of the direct release from biochar and the indirect release of absorbed cod from wastewater or organic carbon from plant roots however which one is dominant under what kinds of situation needs further investigation 4 4 biochar addition influenced tp removal in cws based on 40 groups of tp removal data the median of tp removal in biochar added cw was 60 7 and it was 65 0 in none biochar cws fig 3 actually the data about biochar added cws for tp removal was limited compared to nitrogen removal all the points located at the upper right area came from the studies with sand as substrate in cws with common substrate filled e g fine gravel biochar addition could enhance phosphorus adsorption as substrate absorbance was the main pathway for tp removal in cws 90 91 it was deduced that if the original substrate could not adsorb phosphorus as well as biochar the addition of biochar could enhance tp removal of cws similar to biochar other materials with small diameter or special compositions also had a great capability for tp adsorption 92 93 for example cw with sand as substrate showed better tp removal than the cw with sand and biochar as mixed substrate shown as the points above the line of y x in fig 4b 24 owing to the smaller size of sand however whether biochar or other substrate the adsorption of pollutant could get saturated in the future without continuous biological metabolism 5 biochar addition reduced ghg emission in cws during the wastewater treatment process in cws ghg e g n2o co2 and ch4 could be produced and released into air along with carbon and nitrogen transformations by microbe and plants it was reported that aerobic condition benefit for ch4 oxidation 34 biochar could adjust do ph the growth of microbe and plant influencing the ghg emission subsequently 34 72 it was commonly observed that biochar addition could decrease the n2o emission in soil 94 96 although there were not sufficient studies in the effects of biochar addition on ghg emission in cws similar conclusion was reached according to the summarized data in table 2 it was reported that the n2o emission rate reduced from 113 μg m2 h to 75 0 μg m2 h with biochar addition as substrate in cws 34 significant decrease in n2o emission 30 70 in cws by biochar addition was also found in other studies 7 79 in addition the n2o emission decreased with the increase in c n ratios and supplement of oxygen 7 34 likely due to the do increase by biochar addition that accelerates the transformation of no2 n 79 no2 n was demonstrated to be one of the sources for n2o emission besides n2o co2 and ch4 were also reported the phenomenon that co2 emission decreased while ch4 emission increased after biochar addition in wetlands was reported 7 97 biochar enhanced plant grow and lead to a better co2 fixation in cws 98 biochar was one kind of conductive material which benefited for the electron transfer during the ch4 production by methanogens 97 however the opposite conclusions were drawn by other researchers in a cw kind wastewater treatment bioreactor n2o and co2 emission was enhanced with 30 biochar addition 99 biochar addition in cws decreased ch4 emission in ji s study 34 taken together inconsistent trends of n2o and ch4 emission affected by biochar application were reported between cw studies the mechanism about ghg emission influenced by biochar addition in cws needs further exploration 6 the existing problems during the biochar application in cws 6 1 potential substance release biochar could release nitrogen phosphorus salt alkaline et al these substance release may have negative impacts on the water purification moreover during the production of biochar some toxic material e g benzene series polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs could form simultaneously or be imported from the feedstock e g plants from cws may absorb pahs from wastewater 100 pahs in sewage sludge derived biochar were 600 800 μg kg which could be a pollutant source when applied in environmental amendment 101 besides pahs waste biomass derived biochar could also be a potential source of heavy metal 102 the biological and ecological safety may be threatened during the biochar application in environment media which should be evaluated in advance 6 2 blocks for scale up application although biochar addition in cws could enhance the cod ammonia and tn removal the production cost of biochar was relatively high by the traditional pyrolysis method due to the high temperature and anaerobic condition required many studies have been conducted to reduce the cost of biochar production e g through adjusting the parameters producing biochar e g temperature or procedure time 40 or using microwave steam as a heat source owing to the high efficiency and low energy consumption 103 104 secondly biochar has a light density which may float on the surface when applying in a surface flow cw therefore it should be fix with mesh material before applied 6 3 unclear mechanisms cw system purifies wastewater through the inter functions of plant substrate and microbes the addition of biochar affects plant growth microbial metabolism and substrate property from many aspects however there is a lack of systematic and quantified explanation about the exact mechanisms of the effects of biochar addition in cw systems which involves a multi phase chemical biological process for example biochar could release chemicals into the cw system which may be digested by some microbes inhibit the growth of others or influence plant root absorbance behavior as signal molecular simultaneously though it is known that cod removal was enhanced the quantified influences on microbe or plant are still unclear 7 conclusion the sources and preparation determine biochar s properties and the subsequent influence on cw performance the optimal material and manufacture parameter for biochar production are still not studied systematically biochar addition could improve cod ammonia and tn removal in cws with the enhancement effect more significant under non aeration condition biochar addition in cw systems enhanced pollutant removal by different pathways i e substrate microbe and plant while the quantified contribution from each pathway to the enhancement of pollutant removal needs further investigation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

13218,the process of aerobic granular sludge ags has been considered an alternative of great interest for the tertiary wastewater treatment mainly due to the great capacity of granule densification which makes the system very compact the simultaneous nitrification and denitrification snd occurrence guarantees nitrogen removal at a high level of efficiency and biological phosphorus removal can be optimized in this arrangement with a single treatment stage in sequential batches in this study the general behavior of a sequential batch reactor sbr ags in wastewater treatment and the effect of the air supply regime on nitrogen removal were evaluated a pilot scale system supplied by relatively high concentration wastewater in a warm climate region was set up over 525 days the study was divided into three main phases in phase i a cycle of 3 h of total duration and continuous aeration of the sludge was applied with high efficiency in the removal of soluble chemical oxygen demand scod from the wastewater but excessive drag of total suspended solids tss with the effluent persistently occurred throughout the cycle nitrification went well but wastewater denitrification was only partial with a notorious and worrisome accumulation of nitrite in phase ii the total cycle duration was increased to 4 h but this increase in the time available for the anoxic and aerobic reactions was not enough to control the problem and the nitrite and nitrate residuals remained high in the effluent in phase iii the implementation of an intermittent aeration regime led to the production of an effluent from the treatment system with ammoniacal nitrogen nitrite and nitrate average concentrations of 4 3 mg n l 1 0 4 mg n l 1 and 5 5 mg n l 1 respectively surveys of concentration profiles were carried out over some batches and it was observed that denitrification occurs mostly simultaneously with nitrification during the aeration period the general conclusion of this study is that the application of intermittency regime in the air supply of ags is of great importance for the improvement of nitrogen removal in this process graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords organic matter removal simultaneous nitrification and denitrification nitrite accumulation aeration system pilot scale 1 introduction the process of aerobic granular sludge ags has great potential for the joint removal of organic matter and nutrients present in wastewater for this reason it has been of great interest to researchers and in particular to wastewater sanitation companies in brazil where there are three wastewater treatment plants in operation using this technology in addition to three other plants under construction and 13 under design phase 46 this set of plants when in operation will have an estimated capacity to treat wastewater with an approximate flow of 7 8 m3 s presenting at this time a tendency for this modality to assume an effective participation in the matrix of options for the tertiary treatment of wastewater in brazil given the immediate demand that has been observed for this treatment system in the country studies on a pilot scale are necessary so that it is possible to observe the behavior under climatic conditions and peculiar characteristics of wastewater generated in brazil the various aspects that drive the operation of this type of reactor have been extensively studied in several countries and at different scales however despite the advantages already reported by treatment via ags brazilian researchers have reported important operational difficulties 1 7 the main operational complications reported are biomass instability in some cases there is a total loss of biomass due to granule disintegration long period required for granule formation excessive formation of small granules low nitrogen removal efficiency or absence of denitrification and high accumulation of nitrite which are the same problems reported in the literature 7 13 one of the premises of ags is its ability to jointly remove organic matter and nutrients among the nutrients it is observed that the main route for nitrogen removal is the simultaneous nitrification and denitrification snd process 12 14 15 the morphology of the granules favors the occurrence of the snd process since given its structure the coexistence of aerobic granule surface nitrification and anoxic granule interior denitrification environments is possible 16 this occurs because an oxygen gradient is developed within the granules where the outer layers are aerobic and the inner core is anoxic or anaerobic 17 under these conditions of variable redox potential along the particle the coexistence of organisms responsible for the nitrification and denitrification processes and anaerobic organisms in the same granule is possible 18 therefore the presence of all groups of organisms that take part in the removal of organic matter nitrogen and phosphorus from the wastewater can be guaranteed however for snd process to occur satisfactorily it is necessary to combine operating conditions to be imposed on the reactor in order to balance the concentration of dissolved oxygen ammonia and biodegradable cod as well as the ph and alkalinity aiming to favor both processes the main parameters governing snd in granular sludge are dissolved oxygen do concentration in the bulk liquid granule size and microbial activity several studies have shown that a higher do favors nitrification but limits denitrification whereas a lower do increases denitrification but limits nitrification 19 21 in this regard it is possible to observe in sbr operating as ags the imbalance between the nitrification and denitrification processes disfavoring the latter one of the signs of low denitrification values may be the accumulation of nitrite in the system 22 one of the reasons for the reduction in the rate of complete denitrification may be the inhibition caused by the accumulation of nitrite itself zeng et al 23 and de kreuk and de bruin 24 demonstrated that nitrite concentrations above 1 0 mg n l 1 in anoxic environments promote a reduction in the denitrification rate moreover the accumulation of nitrite in the process can be caused by the low carbon nitrogen ratio 25 26 a solution suggested in the literature is the adoption of an intermittent aeration strategy to prevent the accumulation of nitrite to the point of inhibiting denitrification in systems that operate with snd 27 huang et al 28 compared the application of continuous and intermittent aeration to evaluate the effects of dissolved oxygen do concentration on wastewater contaminant removal sludge granulation and microbiological community diversity the results showed that intermittency in aeration contributes to the increase of the removal efficiency of organic matter nitrogen and phosphorus as well as to accelerate the granulation process increase the particle size and the biological diversity making it difficult to filamentous bacteria to grow besides it provided savings of 40 of the energy consumed for aeration in addition to contributing to the control of nitrite accumulation the application of intermittent aeration promotes a reduction in energy consumption it should be noted that this strategy implies the automation of the aeration system in order to ensure an effective control over the concentration of do in the reactor 22 29 zoppas bernardes and meneguzzi 29 cite several studies that show the success in the effective maintenance of snd through intermittent aeration allowing better control of the process in terms of ph maintenance consumption production of alkalinity and low or zero need to add an external carbon source 30 31 pronk et al 12 also point to the adoption of intermittent aeration for ags as a way to promote complete nitrogen removal nitrification and denitrification table 1 summarizes some of the works in which the effects of the aeration regime on the efficiency of nitrogen removal by an ags are discussed these works were carried out on a small scale and in most cases the system was supplied with a synthetic substrate the results are controversial with significant differences occurring between the necessary efficiencies however in general the results indicate a probable advantage of a different aeration strategy other than a continuous one in this course of action in the third phase of the present work it was decided to promote intermittence in the aeration of the sludge solving the problem of nitrite accumulation that occurred in the previous phases other works that investigate this subject will be introduced directly during the discussion of this study results 2 materials and methods 2 1 ags pilot system the research was developed through a pilot scale experiment the wastewater that supplied the treatment system was obtained from a collection network that serves a student housing complex and the central university restaurant both large areas pumped to the research center the wastewater was discharged into a channel containing the step screen unit the grit chamber controlled by parshall flume and a grease separator this last stage of the preliminary treatment was important to reduce the wastewater grease concentration that was varying between 100 and 200 mg l 1 a high range for a predominantly domestic wastewater then the wastewater was pumped to the reactor by means of a screw pump with a variable speed drive the biological reactor had an internal diameter of 0 50 m and a total height of 5 0 m operating at a working depth of 4 2 m a working volume of 824 l and a working height diameter ratio of 8 4 the wastewater entered the reactor from the bottom at the region where the fine bubble membrane diffuser fed by a blower was installed in fig 1 a schematic section of the reactor with ags and its feeding and discharge systems is presented the sequential batch steps were automated by a programmable logic panel plc which controlled the start and stop of the feed pump and the opening and closing of the solenoid valves for air introduction and effluent disposal 2 2 experimental design after the adjustments from the experimental results the research was divided into three phases in phase i batches with cycles of 3 h were applied to the reactor resulting in a not fully satisfactory nitrogen removal in phase ii cycles of 4 h were applied but the problem of unsatisfactory nitrogen removal persisted during the transition from phase i to phase ii the time of the sedimentation step was increased to 30 min for a short period of time this increase was intended to minimize any possible effect on the loss of biomass with the treated effluent as discussed in 8 therefore in phase iii a modification was proposed to increase the efficiency of nitrogen removal through an imposition of an intermittency regime in the sludge aeration system the number of samples evaluated were 34 29 and 16 and the number of operating cycles were 1520 853 and 630 in phases i ii and iii respectively in fig 2 the experimental design of this study is presented the system started on june 4 2018 and its operation ran for 525 days according to the köeppen geiger classification the facilities are located in the bsh climate region state of sao paulo brazil during the research the air temperature ranged between 17 and 27 c with an average temperature of 24 4 c for initial reactor inoculation 250 l of uasb upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor sludge with 14 400 mg vss l 1 and 300 l of activated sludge with 5100 mg vss l 1 were introduced both used in wastewater treatment aiming at the selection of sludge particles with higher sedimentation velocities the procedure of progressive reduction of the sedimentation period was adopted during the beginning of each experimental phase when it was necessary to increase the sludge alkalinity 40 g l 1 of na2co3 was added during the aeration step essentially the daily operation of the reactor consisted of controlling the reactor supply aeration system and excess sludge disposal during the operation systematic removal of surface scum was carried out and the mass removed from the vss was measured and considered in the calculation of sludge age which was maintained between 6 and 10 days during the experiment 2 3 sampling design and laboratory determinations two daily in situ measurements of the temperature and ph of the influent wastewater and the dissolved oxygen concentration do of the reactor sludge were performed during the experiment composite of 4 influent samples from different sampling points and 1 effluent wastewater sample were collected twice a week throughout the experiment to determine the total and volatile suspended solids the total and soluble chemical oxygen demand cod the total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn ammonia nitrogen nitrite only in effluent nitrate only in effluent the total and soluble phosphorus and alkalinity all analytical methodologies followed the 21st edition of the standard methods for examination of water and wastewater 39 the sedimentability of the biological reactor sludge was evaluated according to the volumetric sludge index tests svi30 and svi5 twice a week throughout the experiment table 2 shows the methodology and main methods used in the study 2 4 morphological characterization of the aerobic granules morphological characterization of the aerobic granules in the reactor was carried out twice a week by image analysis as described previously 47 the imagej software version 1 45 s was used to determine ferret s diameter and sphericity of the granular particles once aerobic granulation has been achieved particle size distribution was evaluated by scattering low angle laser light technique laser diffraction 0 05 to 2000 μm malvern laser light scattering instrument malvern instruments worcestershire uk for this purpose 30 ml of a completely mixed sample was collected during the aeration phase this analysis shows the percentage of granules clusters greater than 0 2 mm over the entire biomass present in the reactor more detailed information about the granulation process can be found in the supplementary material 2 5 study on the variation of nitrogen forms concentration during a cycle in order to further evaluate the conditions in which nitrogen removal occurred in this wastewater treatment process sampling campaigns and analysis were carried out every 15 min during typical batches of 3 or 4 h depending on the phase with each aliquot determinations of ammonia nitrogen nitrite nitrate alkalinity ph dissolved oxygen and temperature were performed 2 6 efficiency of the snd process eq 1 proposed by third et al 41 was used to calculate the efficiency of the snd process efficiency snd 1 efficiency snd nh 3 oxidized no x produced nh 3 oxidized 100 where nh3 oxidized represents the total amount of nh3 n oxidized after reaction nox produced is the amount of nox n including nitrite and nitrate present when nh3 n is degraded 3 results and discussion although the emphasis of this work is to evaluate the effects of the intermittence imposition in the aeration process the characteristics of the sludge and the results obtained in the removal of organic matter are important making it possible to establish in what conditions the sludge was found when it was submitted to the modifications in the aeration cycle to remove nitrogen from wastewater 3 1 reactor sludge characteristics table 3 presents a summary of the reactor sludge characteristics throughout all experimental phases as the reactor was started with sludge consisting of granules from a uasb reactor and activated sludge flakes the sludge increase occurred while a cod charge was applied and the excess sludge was removed resulting in a sludge age of around 8 days which is a value slightly above the minimum sludge age for nitrification at local temperature this resulted in a variable f m ratio between 0 8 and 1 4 kg cod kg vss 1 day 1 in the three experimental phases the average concentration of vss was around 3 0 kg m 3 in a stabilized regime reaching maximum concentrations of vss between 4 0 kg m 3 and 5 0 kg m 3 with highest values recorded during phase iii these values are slightly below the vss concentrations that can be achieved in ags and this fact was associated with the problem of solid wash out with the reactor effluent which occurred frequently and with some episodes of excessive loss the wastewater that supplied the reactor had a high concentration of oils and greases and in some circumstances the grease retention box was not sufficient for a continuous feeding of the reactor with a low grease concentration wastewater this is very important for systems that receive input from sludge removed from septic tanks leachate from landfills or any other source of contamination that could be detrimental to the formation and maintenance of the granules oil grease and fat free ogf given time and as long as the mixing intensity is sufficient these components are perfectly biodegradable however high concentrations can cause problems in the maintenance of the aerobic granule formation of a scum layer composed of slowly biodegradable material floating in the liquid phase excessive energy consumption due to excess aeration deficiency in nutrient removal or development of hydrophobic filaments that attach to air bubbles and float to the reactor surface 42 the particle size analysis indicated the predominance of particles with a diameter of 0 2 2 0 mm in all experimental phases particles larger than 2 0 mm occupied about 5 of the total volume of biomass present in the reactor according to de kreuk et al 15 20 particles with a diameter greater than 0 2 mm can be considered granules whose size can reach up to 6 0 mm therefore particle size analysis reinforces the occurrence of the phenomenon of granulation and its maintenance throughout the experiment further details on the granulation process and the morphological characteristics of the granular sludge used in this study are presented in 8 as a result the reactor sludge presented mean svi30 values between 65 ml g 1 and 92 ml g 1 these values are low and indicate good operating conditions for a flocculated activated sludge but still above the values obtained for granular sludge which can reach values as low as 40 ml g 1 42 the values obtained are coherent in principle with the particle size distribution of the sludge in which a predominance of granules in relation to the flakes was not observed according to van haandel van der lubbe 42 the expected svi5 value for ags is 70 to 80 mg l g 1 and the svi30 is 55 to 60 mg l g 1 the svi5 results present a higher value range than svi30 with average values between 101 ml g 1 and 184 ml g 1 indicating that values were not so close that they could represent a high sedimentation velocity typical of granulated sludge this result is compatible with the intensity of solid wash out with the reactor effluent the maximum concentration of tss in the reactor sludge reached 6 0 kg m 3 an intermediate value between what is applied to flocculated sludge generally less than 4 0 kg m 3 and to granular sludge proposed values around 8 0 kg m 3 the sludge vss tss ratio remained in the range of 0 83 and 0 87 these values are typical of activated sludge with low sludge age a situation where there is a higher production of excess sludge and a lower degree of digestion compared to extended aeration systems 3 2 organic matter removal fig 3 presents the concentration time series and box whiskers diagrams of different cod fractions and solids from the influent and effluent wastewater of the ags reactor the reactor effluent scod remained low with mean values of 56 mg l 1 31 mg l 1 and 18 mg l 1 in phase i ii and iii respectively these results demonstrate high efficiency in the flocculation or granulation of wastewater colloidal matter ensuring that the reactor is fully operational in terms of organic compounds oxidation and biomass growth although it was considered that a stabilized regime was reached at each stage the average effluent scod decreased through the phases and in phase iii it was possible to obtain effluent scod as low as expected for this high efficiency treatment modality however the continuous solid wash out from the reactor with the effluent was a distinct feature of the reactor operation throughout the three operational phases the mean concentration of tss in the treated wastewater ranged between 66 and 119 mg l 1 in the second stage there were episodes in which the effluent presented higher tss and vss values this is due to operational variability notably at the beginning of the change in operational strategy 3 h to 4 h during this period there were episodes with maximum tss and vss values of 1041 mg l 1 and 470 mg l 1 as shown in fig 3 b in these cases intentional sludge disposal was not performed for srt control however we emphasize that these were sporadic episodes and that the system operated with a mean tss of 119 mg l 1 fig 3 and that the srt was controlled as the dragged sludge was predominantly volatile the increase in cod in the treated wastewater was substantial with the tcod vss ratio of the phase ii effluent resulting in 1 39 kg cod kg vss 1 day 1 comparing all phase s results the tcod vss ratio of phase ii represents the closest value to the theoretical prediction of 1 48 kg cod kg vss 1 day 1 43 controlling the loss of solids with the effluent is essential for the reactor operation and it needs to be achieved even in the situations where the feed characteristics are more favorable otherwise standards for disposal under more restrictive wastewater conditions can only be achieved through effluent filtration a relatively complex and costly operation in addition it is not possible to exert hydraulic control of the sludge age in the present study the sludge age was determined considering the intentionally discarded sludge from the reactor the solid loss with the effluent and the surface accumulated and overflowed scum these last two parcels proved to be significant in this work the pilot scale unit was sized to ensure greater representativeness of results than bench scale studies and fed by real sewage it was possible to more closely represent the possibilities of occurrence in a real wwtp in which conditions are less controlled than bench scale reactors fed by synthetic substrate under constant flow the use of small volume reactors fed by synthetic substrate constitutes a large part of the works on snd in the ags found in the literature in relation to the influent cod it is observed in fig 3 a greater dispersion of results in phase i compared to the others in all phases the influent scod values showed a more uniform and narrow variation range as it was expected there was a reduction in the influent cod from the first to the third phase but this effect was eliminated by the effective control of the f m ratio with the feed flow being increased to compensate the lower cod concentration of the wastewater as the proper cod load was always maintained to allow sufficient sludge growth to produce the 8 day sludge wastewater mass regarding the characteristics of the reactor effluent the most important thing in the time series analysis is that tss wash out with the effluent occurred continuously and equalized throughout the experiment with no defined trend of increase or reduction over time indicating that the results are not just isolated episodes of large losses therefore the cod values of the effluent followed this behavior and it was significantly increased by the particulate fraction which greatly reduced the quality of the treated wastewater although there is a need to correct this operational problem the effects of this phenomenon on nitrogen removal are small affecting only the behavior of the particulate organic fraction and it does not significantly interfere with the conclusions of this study on nitrogen removal in general the box whiskers diagrams in fig 3 indicate that in all phases the effluent vss varied within a not very wide range likewise it is observed in fig 3 that the effluent scod also varied within a narrow range of relatively low values pronk et al 12 performed a study at wwtp garmerwolde in the netherlands with an ags process treating 28 600 m3 day 1 during dry weather flow the reactors had a robust and stable granular sludge bed with more than 8 0 g tss l 1 and svi5 of 45 ml g 1 consisted of more than 80 of granules larger than 0 2 mm and more than 60 larger than 1 mm the authors reported that it was possible to reach an effluent with an average of only 20 mg tss l 1 demonstrating that it is possible to contain the excessive solid wash out in wwtp with ags therefore in the present study it was necessary to identify the influent wastewater characteristics or operational conditions that hinder the formation of a greater quantity of particles with more favorable sedimentability 3 3 nitrogen removal nitrogen removal and its mechanisms are directly associated with the main objective of this work and its results will be discussed individually by phase 3 3 1 phase i nitrogen removal the results obtained in phase i are represented in fig 4 as time series and box whiskers diagrams there is a relatively high mean concentration of tkn in the reactor influent wastewater around 90 mg n l 1 where 60 mg n l 1 correspond to the ammoniacal fraction since the mean cod in phase i resulted in 900 mg l 1 where around 300 mg l 1 correspond to the soluble fraction the tkn tcod ratio resulted in 0 10 and the tkn scod ratio in 0 30 this information is important for the assessment of denitrification capacity it is observed in fig 4 that the wastewater nitrification occurred with high intensity since the average concentration of ammonia nitrogen in the reactor influent wastewater was 61 mg n l 1 and in the reactor effluent it was 8 mg n l 1 constituting more than 50 mg n l 1 of effectively oxidized ammonia to this amount it must be added the portion of tkn converted to ammonia the high concentration of tkn in the reactor effluent an average of 27 mg n l 1 was largely due to the organic nitrogen present in suspended solid particles washed out with the reactor effluent as described by von sperling 44 organic nitrogen is one of the constituents of suspended solids and dissolved solids tkn can be further subdivided in a soluble fraction dominated by ammonia and a particulate fraction associated with the organic suspended solids nitrogen participates in the constitution of practically all forms of particulate organic matter in sewage 44 the denitrification process conversely showed instability with situations of high efficiency and of high concentration of nitrite or nitrate in the effluent with values of 24 mg n l 1 and 18 mg n l 1 respectively as shown in fig 4 the results in fig 4 also show that in this case the wastewater nitrification process has the potential to consume practically all the alkalinity present in the wastewater and the possibility of artificial correction should be ensured when there is a tendency for a ph decrease to the point of concern for the development of the various biochemical processes involved to accomplish a mass balance based on fig 4 results it is considered that the working volume of the reactor is 0 8 m3 and that the average concentration of vss recorded in phase i is around 3 0 kg m 3 table 3 resulting a mass of vss in the reactor of mxv 0 8 3 0 2 4 kg vss it is also considered that the food microorganisms food mass ratio corresponding to the 8 day sludge is around 1 0 kg cod kg vss day 1 and the applied cod load results in 1 0 2 4 2 4 kg cod day 1 since the mean wastewater cod concentration is around 0 9 kg m 3 fig 3 the mean reference wastewater discharge is 2 4 0 9 2 7 m3 day 1 in order to maintain the 8 day sludge age the amount of excess sludge to be discarded mxv rs is δxv 2 4 8 0 3 kg vss day 1 as the mean tkn concentration of the influent in phase i is 88 mg n l 1 and the ammonia nitrogen concentration of the effluent is 8 mg n l 1 fig 4 the amount of nitrified nitrogen results in δn nitrif 88 8 10 3 2 7 0 1 0 3 10 3 69 mg n l 1 this means that the system had a high nitrification capacity for this nitrification potential to be exerted the expected alkalinity consumption is based on the process stoichiometry without considering alkalinity replacement via denitrification 7 14 69 490 mg caco3 l 1 as the total alkalinity of the wastewater is 225 mg caco3 l 1 fig 4 the need for artificial introduction of alkalinity is evident in order to guarantee the functioning of the system even if there is a damage to the denitrification process the potential to nitrify about 69 mg n l 1 results in the generation of nitrate in equally high concentrations so that limitations in denitrification may occur due to the lack of readily biodegradable carbon since the scod of the wastewater fig 3 is only around 300 mg l 1 analyzing the ammonia nitrogen concentrations in the reactor effluent it is observed in fig 4 a that the nitrification occurred satisfactorily with large amounts of ammonia oxidized and with a low concentration of this constituent in the treated wastewater almost invariably throughout phase i the most important thing to be observed in this fig 4 a is the accumulation of nitrite that occurred in the reactor effluent practically during all phase i period with concentrations in the range between 10 mg n l 1 and 24 mg n l 1 approximately this clearly indicates the blocking of nitration resulting in a highly difficult problem for the discharge of treated wastewater the nitrate concentration also increased excessively especially in the period between the 120th day of operation and the end of phase i distinctively indicating that denitrification did not take place satisfactorily since there was no replacement of a significant alkalinity portion by a successful denitrification practically all the alkalinity of the wastewater was consumed as can be seen in fig 4 a artificial alkalinity replacement was only sufficient to prevent acute drops in ph values which effectively did not occur layer et al 36 supplied 13 l sbr ags columns with synthetic substrate raw and decanted wastewater the total duration of a cycle was 5 6 h of which 1 5 h was reserved for anaerobic feeding in a plug flow regime and 4 0 h for the aerobic phase the do concentration during the aerobic phase was controlled at a set point of 2 0 mg o2 l 1 constant do as in the present work but with low concentration wastewater the authors concluded that the occurrence of snd was limited which led to a low tn removal efficiency resulting in effluent with high tn and nox the efficiency obtained from snd was 61 5 14 1 the authors conclude that it was necessary to modify the aeration strategy to increase the efficiency of the system for nitrogen removal an interesting aspect observed in fig 4 b is the relatively high concentration range in which the reactor effluent tkn varied although this fact can be easily justified by the presence of organic nitrogen associated with washed out vss with the reactor effluent no direct correlation was observed between the results of these two quantities during phase i also in fig 4 b the large consumption of alkalinity caused by wastewater nitrification is confirmed 3 3 2 phase ii nitrogen removal the results obtained in phase ii are plotted in fig 5 in the form of time series fig 5 a and box whiskers diagrams fig 5 b in phase ii the reactor influent wastewater presented an average tkn concentration around 60 mg n l 1 with 40 mg n l 1 of ammonia nitrogen these results are about 35 lower than the respective ones obtained in phase i a favorable fact for the nitrification denitrification reactions to be completed as the reduction in wastewater cod occurred proportionally to the tkn the tkn tcod ratio remained around 0 10 it is also observed in fig 5 b that the nitrogen transformation processes occurred in phase ii in order to produce effluent with 12 mg n l 1 of tkn and 5 mg n l 1 of ammonia nitrogen lower values than those obtained in phase i knowing that in phase ii the solid wash out with the effluent persisted the efficiency obtained from snd was 79 4 28 3 despite the significant reduction in the concentrations of tkn and ammonia nitrogen as in phase i the removal of nitrogen presented instability with situations of high nitrite or nitrate concentrations in the effluent with values of 26 mg n l 1 and around 17 mg n l 1 respectively as shown in fig 5 these results are a major concern especially in relation to the accumulation of nitrite in the effluent regarding the alkalinity results presented in fig 5 it can be stated that the mass balance presented for phase i occurred approximately without changes in relation to phase i in which the lowest average alkalinity consumption in phase ii is considered as a function of the lower tkn concentration of the influent in fig 5 a the concentrations of ammonia nitrogen in the reactor effluent remained low throughout phase ii indicating that the nitrification process occurred satisfactorily analyzing the nitrate concentrations in fig 5 a this constituent was also well controlled during phase ii and the effluent almost invariably presented values below 10 mg n l 1 which is an acceptable value for any wastewater discharge condition in brazil indicating a successful denitrification process however unfortunately it was also observed in phase ii the occurrence of nitrite accumulation distributed over the entire cycle and with the occurrence of very high and impeding values for various discharge conditions knowing that the limits for nitrite in natural waters are more restrictive than those for nitrate this results matches with others studies such as pronk et al 12 liu et al 11 and cetin et al 9 in general the reactor with ags presented similar behavior to phase i in terms of nitrogen removal in fig 5 b the same situation that occurred in phase i can be noted with practically total consumption of the natural alkalinity present in the reactor influent wastewater the diagrams in fig 5 b show that the reactor effluent tkn is significantly affected by the wash out of solids in conclusion the modification introduced from phase i to phase ii a proposed new operational scheme allowing more time for biochemical processes to occur did not produce the desired effects although coincidentally there was a reduction in the influent tkn in relation to phase i this finding supported the development of phase iii 3 3 3 phase iii nitrogen removal the results obtained in phase iii will be first analyzed based on fig 6 in which they are presented in the form of time series plots in fig 6 tkn results for the reactor influent range between 60 mg n l 1 and 80 mg n l 1 intermediate values in relation to phase i higher results and phase ii lower results it is also observed in fig 6 that the reactor influent ammoniacal nitrogen concentration range between 40 mg n l 1 and 60 mg n l 1 approximately the mean cod in phase iii resulted in 540 mg l 1 of which around 270 mg l 1 correspond to the soluble fraction the average concentration of influent tkn is 72 mg n l 1 44 mg n l 1 of ammonia nitrogen in phase iii the tkn tcod ratio resulted in 0 13 and the tkn scod ratio in 0 26 not presenting significant changes in relation to the other phases observing the effluent ammonia concentrations low values are frequently observed throughout phase iii indicating that under ammonia nitrogen reduction the wastewater nitrification process occurred satisfactorily however when observing the results of nitrite and nitrate in the effluent two periods are distinguished initially high concentrations of these anions were observed until the 70th day of operation of phase iii approximately after that these concentrations were very well controlled as can be seen in fig 6 these findings led to a change in the operational procedure of phase iii replacing the previous intermittent regime in the interruption of aeration of 5 min after 20 min for a new interruption regime of 15 min after 60 min this last condition was considered the most favorable and it was capable of eliminating the problem of nitrite and nitrate accumulation in the effluent so it was maintained until the end of the experiment fig 6 presents the statistical parameters related to the results obtained in phase iii only after the establishment of the 15 min aeration arrest regime every 60 min of operation the mean concentrations of ammonia nitrite and nitrate in the reactor effluent resulted respectively in 4 3 mg n l 1 0 4 mg n l 1 and 5 5 mg n l 1 with reasonably low standard deviations these values indicate that the imposition of an intermittent regime in the ags aeration results in an effluent with high quality in terms of the low concentrations of the various forms of nitrogen making this wastewater treatment process available for situations with stricter restrictions on these chemical species analyzing fig 6 no characteristics of the effluent or of the biological reactor varied in relation to the previous phases this fact ensures that the improvement in nitrogen removal was due to the imposition of intermittence in the aeration and these results are compatible with that reported by hu et al 38 the results in fig 6 also show that the wastewater nitrification process under these conditions in which denitrification is practically complete has the potential to consume all the alkalinity present in the wastewater and it ensures the possibility of artificially introducing alkalinity to avoid instability in reactor sludge ph values huang et al 28 compared the application of a cycle with continuous aeration for 320 min where two aeration arrest were applied the first one for 60 min after 90 min of aeration and the second one for 75 min after 60 min subsequently the first arrest they used a reactor with a working volume of 4 27 l supplied with synthetic substrate the results showed that with continuous aeration 99 of nh4 and 80 of total nitrogen tn were removed while with intermittent aeration the removal efficiency of nh4 was 100 and of tn was 98 despite the differences in the objective and the conditions imposed in relation to the present study this comparison confirmed that working with real wastewater and on a larger scale the intermittency in the aeration tends to increase the efficiency of the process with ags in the removal of nitrogen in the previously mentioned work that was developed at wwtp garmerwolde 12 they provided a recycle from the top to the bottom for maximizing nitrogen removal operating with intermittent aeration the dissolved oxygen concentration was maintained between 1 8 and 2 5 mg l 1 during aeration periods according to the authors the effluent requirements of 7 mg n l 1 and 1 mg p l 1 were easily met this demonstrates that the effects of the application of intermittent aeration are of practical recognition but it is necessary to produce subsidies for the definition of applicable conditions to wastewaters produced under particular conditions in different regions 3 4 evaluation of nitrification denitrification process through concentration profiles in order to enhance the knowledge about the nitrogen transformations in the ags process determinations of the different constituents were carried out every 15 min along typical sequential batches of each experimental phase 3 4 1 phase i concentration profile the average results obtained from the concentration profile surveys throughout phase i are presented in fig 7 fig 7 shows that the dissolved oxygen concentration do in the ags was kept high during the aeration period the ammonia concentration decreases continuously throughout the aeration period and the alkalinity consumption follows this reduction it is also explicitly observed a nitrite and nitrate accumulation being formed in the nitrification under aeration demonstrating that there are no conditions for denitrification during this stage of the cycle which do not characterize simultaneous nitrification and denitrification snd the efficiency obtained from snd was 63 2 29 6 the nitrite and nitrate partial residuals from the previous cycle are diluted by the wastewater entrance and partially used for denitrification during the filling period which behaved as anoxic and not as anaerobic thus the concentrations of these ions at the beginning of aeration are not very high but they tend to increase during this period demonstrating that denitrification did not occur simultaneously with nitrification at least not in the same proportion this could be expected due to the high concentrations of do for a granular sludge but with particles with an average diameter slightly greater than 0 2 mm that is not very high 3 4 2 phase ii concentration profile the average results obtained in the concentration profile surveys throughout phase ii are presented in fig 8 by observing the concentration profiles shown in fig 8 it is concluded that the general behavior in phase ii was similar to phase i the main difference in phase ii is that the accumulation of nitrate during the aeration period was greater than in phase i making the nitrate concentrations at the beginning of the aeration period also higher due to the lower performance of the feeding period as a denitrification chamber 3 4 3 phase iii concentration profile the average results obtained in the concentration profile surveys throughout phase iii are presented in fig 9 as shown in fig 9 the concentration profiles in phase iii demonstrate the beneficial effects of imposing intermittent aeration on nitrogen removal which matches others studies 23 28 38 ammonia consumption occurred at a very high rate and as aeration was arrested denitrification was carried out controlling the residuals of nitrite and nitrate thus at the end of the aeration period ammonia nitrite and nitrate had low concentrations providing favorable characteristics for the effluent and for the liquid that remains in the reactor to receive a new load of wastewater in the next cycle that is the reactor achieved a dynamic balance that ensured stable operating conditions and satisfactory performance of the treatment system another aspect that draws attention is the fact that the possibility of reducing these compounds is obtained in a short period of time this shows that the operating cycle can be optimized and conducted based on the desired residual of these compounds it is not part of this work but the reduction of nitrite or nitrate concentrations to very low levels are necessary so that the feed period of the reactor with the wastewater effectively integrates the system as an anaerobic chamber acting in the biochemical mechanisms of phosphorus removal 4 conclusion in phase i the system was operated on a pilot scale with cycles of 3 h of total duration with continuous aeration and other conditions despite the treatment of a relatively concentrated wastewater in a hot climate region the ags was efficient in removing soluble organic matter and in wastewater nitrification but excessive wash out of tss occurred with the effluent and the denitrification process was incomplete highlighting the occurrence of nitrite accumulation in phase ii the total cycle duration was increased to 4 h but the continuous aeration regime was maintained there was no substantial change in the reactor behavior and the problem of nitrite accumulation persisted demonstrating that the main cause was not the shortage of reaction time whether in anoxic or aerobic conditions the problem of excessive wash out of tss with the effluent also persisted raising the level of concern with this phenomenon which extended throughout the operation of the pilot unit even though effective control was exerted over the age of the sludge in phase iii it was maintained the 4 h cycle used in phase ii but it was implemented an intermittent regime in the air supply for the ags reactor the system maintained the desired efficiency in removing soluble organic matter the nitrification process was practically completed resulting in low residual concentrations of ammoniacal nitrogen in the treated wastewater the efficiency in denitrification increased significantly with no more nitrate and nitrate accumulation whose concentrations were always kept low in the treated wastewater in conclusion this study demonstrates that for the conditions in which it was applied the imposition of an intermittency regime in the air supply is of great importance to obtain an efficient nitrogen removal in an ags system the identification of the concentration profiles of the nitrogen species over the course of some batches clearly demonstrated the occurrence of snd when there is intermittent ags aeration since the residuals of nitrite and nitrate that were formed during the aeration were immediately consumed in denitrification and kept low during the course of the aeration stage but snd although prevalent has not been shown to be the exclusive nitrogen removal mechanism as the residual nitrite and nitrate at the end of a batch were further used during the anaerobic anoxic filling period credit authorship contribution statement

13218,the process of aerobic granular sludge ags has been considered an alternative of great interest for the tertiary wastewater treatment mainly due to the great capacity of granule densification which makes the system very compact the simultaneous nitrification and denitrification snd occurrence guarantees nitrogen removal at a high level of efficiency and biological phosphorus removal can be optimized in this arrangement with a single treatment stage in sequential batches in this study the general behavior of a sequential batch reactor sbr ags in wastewater treatment and the effect of the air supply regime on nitrogen removal were evaluated a pilot scale system supplied by relatively high concentration wastewater in a warm climate region was set up over 525 days the study was divided into three main phases in phase i a cycle of 3 h of total duration and continuous aeration of the sludge was applied with high efficiency in the removal of soluble chemical oxygen demand scod from the wastewater but excessive drag of total suspended solids tss with the effluent persistently occurred throughout the cycle nitrification went well but wastewater denitrification was only partial with a notorious and worrisome accumulation of nitrite in phase ii the total cycle duration was increased to 4 h but this increase in the time available for the anoxic and aerobic reactions was not enough to control the problem and the nitrite and nitrate residuals remained high in the effluent in phase iii the implementation of an intermittent aeration regime led to the production of an effluent from the treatment system with ammoniacal nitrogen nitrite and nitrate average concentrations of 4 3 mg n l 1 0 4 mg n l 1 and 5 5 mg n l 1 respectively surveys of concentration profiles were carried out over some batches and it was observed that denitrification occurs mostly simultaneously with nitrification during the aeration period the general conclusion of this study is that the application of intermittency regime in the air supply of ags is of great importance for the improvement of nitrogen removal in this process graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords organic matter removal simultaneous nitrification and denitrification nitrite accumulation aeration system pilot scale 1 introduction the process of aerobic granular sludge ags has great potential for the joint removal of organic matter and nutrients present in wastewater for this reason it has been of great interest to researchers and in particular to wastewater sanitation companies in brazil where there are three wastewater treatment plants in operation using this technology in addition to three other plants under construction and 13 under design phase 46 this set of plants when in operation will have an estimated capacity to treat wastewater with an approximate flow of 7 8 m3 s presenting at this time a tendency for this modality to assume an effective participation in the matrix of options for the tertiary treatment of wastewater in brazil given the immediate demand that has been observed for this treatment system in the country studies on a pilot scale are necessary so that it is possible to observe the behavior under climatic conditions and peculiar characteristics of wastewater generated in brazil the various aspects that drive the operation of this type of reactor have been extensively studied in several countries and at different scales however despite the advantages already reported by treatment via ags brazilian researchers have reported important operational difficulties 1 7 the main operational complications reported are biomass instability in some cases there is a total loss of biomass due to granule disintegration long period required for granule formation excessive formation of small granules low nitrogen removal efficiency or absence of denitrification and high accumulation of nitrite which are the same problems reported in the literature 7 13 one of the premises of ags is its ability to jointly remove organic matter and nutrients among the nutrients it is observed that the main route for nitrogen removal is the simultaneous nitrification and denitrification snd process 12 14 15 the morphology of the granules favors the occurrence of the snd process since given its structure the coexistence of aerobic granule surface nitrification and anoxic granule interior denitrification environments is possible 16 this occurs because an oxygen gradient is developed within the granules where the outer layers are aerobic and the inner core is anoxic or anaerobic 17 under these conditions of variable redox potential along the particle the coexistence of organisms responsible for the nitrification and denitrification processes and anaerobic organisms in the same granule is possible 18 therefore the presence of all groups of organisms that take part in the removal of organic matter nitrogen and phosphorus from the wastewater can be guaranteed however for snd process to occur satisfactorily it is necessary to combine operating conditions to be imposed on the reactor in order to balance the concentration of dissolved oxygen ammonia and biodegradable cod as well as the ph and alkalinity aiming to favor both processes the main parameters governing snd in granular sludge are dissolved oxygen do concentration in the bulk liquid granule size and microbial activity several studies have shown that a higher do favors nitrification but limits denitrification whereas a lower do increases denitrification but limits nitrification 19 21 in this regard it is possible to observe in sbr operating as ags the imbalance between the nitrification and denitrification processes disfavoring the latter one of the signs of low denitrification values may be the accumulation of nitrite in the system 22 one of the reasons for the reduction in the rate of complete denitrification may be the inhibition caused by the accumulation of nitrite itself zeng et al 23 and de kreuk and de bruin 24 demonstrated that nitrite concentrations above 1 0 mg n l 1 in anoxic environments promote a reduction in the denitrification rate moreover the accumulation of nitrite in the process can be caused by the low carbon nitrogen ratio 25 26 a solution suggested in the literature is the adoption of an intermittent aeration strategy to prevent the accumulation of nitrite to the point of inhibiting denitrification in systems that operate with snd 27 huang et al 28 compared the application of continuous and intermittent aeration to evaluate the effects of dissolved oxygen do concentration on wastewater contaminant removal sludge granulation and microbiological community diversity the results showed that intermittency in aeration contributes to the increase of the removal efficiency of organic matter nitrogen and phosphorus as well as to accelerate the granulation process increase the particle size and the biological diversity making it difficult to filamentous bacteria to grow besides it provided savings of 40 of the energy consumed for aeration in addition to contributing to the control of nitrite accumulation the application of intermittent aeration promotes a reduction in energy consumption it should be noted that this strategy implies the automation of the aeration system in order to ensure an effective control over the concentration of do in the reactor 22 29 zoppas bernardes and meneguzzi 29 cite several studies that show the success in the effective maintenance of snd through intermittent aeration allowing better control of the process in terms of ph maintenance consumption production of alkalinity and low or zero need to add an external carbon source 30 31 pronk et al 12 also point to the adoption of intermittent aeration for ags as a way to promote complete nitrogen removal nitrification and denitrification table 1 summarizes some of the works in which the effects of the aeration regime on the efficiency of nitrogen removal by an ags are discussed these works were carried out on a small scale and in most cases the system was supplied with a synthetic substrate the results are controversial with significant differences occurring between the necessary efficiencies however in general the results indicate a probable advantage of a different aeration strategy other than a continuous one in this course of action in the third phase of the present work it was decided to promote intermittence in the aeration of the sludge solving the problem of nitrite accumulation that occurred in the previous phases other works that investigate this subject will be introduced directly during the discussion of this study results 2 materials and methods 2 1 ags pilot system the research was developed through a pilot scale experiment the wastewater that supplied the treatment system was obtained from a collection network that serves a student housing complex and the central university restaurant both large areas pumped to the research center the wastewater was discharged into a channel containing the step screen unit the grit chamber controlled by parshall flume and a grease separator this last stage of the preliminary treatment was important to reduce the wastewater grease concentration that was varying between 100 and 200 mg l 1 a high range for a predominantly domestic wastewater then the wastewater was pumped to the reactor by means of a screw pump with a variable speed drive the biological reactor had an internal diameter of 0 50 m and a total height of 5 0 m operating at a working depth of 4 2 m a working volume of 824 l and a working height diameter ratio of 8 4 the wastewater entered the reactor from the bottom at the region where the fine bubble membrane diffuser fed by a blower was installed in fig 1 a schematic section of the reactor with ags and its feeding and discharge systems is presented the sequential batch steps were automated by a programmable logic panel plc which controlled the start and stop of the feed pump and the opening and closing of the solenoid valves for air introduction and effluent disposal 2 2 experimental design after the adjustments from the experimental results the research was divided into three phases in phase i batches with cycles of 3 h were applied to the reactor resulting in a not fully satisfactory nitrogen removal in phase ii cycles of 4 h were applied but the problem of unsatisfactory nitrogen removal persisted during the transition from phase i to phase ii the time of the sedimentation step was increased to 30 min for a short period of time this increase was intended to minimize any possible effect on the loss of biomass with the treated effluent as discussed in 8 therefore in phase iii a modification was proposed to increase the efficiency of nitrogen removal through an imposition of an intermittency regime in the sludge aeration system the number of samples evaluated were 34 29 and 16 and the number of operating cycles were 1520 853 and 630 in phases i ii and iii respectively in fig 2 the experimental design of this study is presented the system started on june 4 2018 and its operation ran for 525 days according to the köeppen geiger classification the facilities are located in the bsh climate region state of sao paulo brazil during the research the air temperature ranged between 17 and 27 c with an average temperature of 24 4 c for initial reactor inoculation 250 l of uasb upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor sludge with 14 400 mg vss l 1 and 300 l of activated sludge with 5100 mg vss l 1 were introduced both used in wastewater treatment aiming at the selection of sludge particles with higher sedimentation velocities the procedure of progressive reduction of the sedimentation period was adopted during the beginning of each experimental phase when it was necessary to increase the sludge alkalinity 40 g l 1 of na2co3 was added during the aeration step essentially the daily operation of the reactor consisted of controlling the reactor supply aeration system and excess sludge disposal during the operation systematic removal of surface scum was carried out and the mass removed from the vss was measured and considered in the calculation of sludge age which was maintained between 6 and 10 days during the experiment 2 3 sampling design and laboratory determinations two daily in situ measurements of the temperature and ph of the influent wastewater and the dissolved oxygen concentration do of the reactor sludge were performed during the experiment composite of 4 influent samples from different sampling points and 1 effluent wastewater sample were collected twice a week throughout the experiment to determine the total and volatile suspended solids the total and soluble chemical oxygen demand cod the total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn ammonia nitrogen nitrite only in effluent nitrate only in effluent the total and soluble phosphorus and alkalinity all analytical methodologies followed the 21st edition of the standard methods for examination of water and wastewater 39 the sedimentability of the biological reactor sludge was evaluated according to the volumetric sludge index tests svi30 and svi5 twice a week throughout the experiment table 2 shows the methodology and main methods used in the study 2 4 morphological characterization of the aerobic granules morphological characterization of the aerobic granules in the reactor was carried out twice a week by image analysis as described previously 47 the imagej software version 1 45 s was used to determine ferret s diameter and sphericity of the granular particles once aerobic granulation has been achieved particle size distribution was evaluated by scattering low angle laser light technique laser diffraction 0 05 to 2000 μm malvern laser light scattering instrument malvern instruments worcestershire uk for this purpose 30 ml of a completely mixed sample was collected during the aeration phase this analysis shows the percentage of granules clusters greater than 0 2 mm over the entire biomass present in the reactor more detailed information about the granulation process can be found in the supplementary material 2 5 study on the variation of nitrogen forms concentration during a cycle in order to further evaluate the conditions in which nitrogen removal occurred in this wastewater treatment process sampling campaigns and analysis were carried out every 15 min during typical batches of 3 or 4 h depending on the phase with each aliquot determinations of ammonia nitrogen nitrite nitrate alkalinity ph dissolved oxygen and temperature were performed 2 6 efficiency of the snd process eq 1 proposed by third et al 41 was used to calculate the efficiency of the snd process efficiency snd 1 efficiency snd nh 3 oxidized no x produced nh 3 oxidized 100 where nh3 oxidized represents the total amount of nh3 n oxidized after reaction nox produced is the amount of nox n including nitrite and nitrate present when nh3 n is degraded 3 results and discussion although the emphasis of this work is to evaluate the effects of the intermittence imposition in the aeration process the characteristics of the sludge and the results obtained in the removal of organic matter are important making it possible to establish in what conditions the sludge was found when it was submitted to the modifications in the aeration cycle to remove nitrogen from wastewater 3 1 reactor sludge characteristics table 3 presents a summary of the reactor sludge characteristics throughout all experimental phases as the reactor was started with sludge consisting of granules from a uasb reactor and activated sludge flakes the sludge increase occurred while a cod charge was applied and the excess sludge was removed resulting in a sludge age of around 8 days which is a value slightly above the minimum sludge age for nitrification at local temperature this resulted in a variable f m ratio between 0 8 and 1 4 kg cod kg vss 1 day 1 in the three experimental phases the average concentration of vss was around 3 0 kg m 3 in a stabilized regime reaching maximum concentrations of vss between 4 0 kg m 3 and 5 0 kg m 3 with highest values recorded during phase iii these values are slightly below the vss concentrations that can be achieved in ags and this fact was associated with the problem of solid wash out with the reactor effluent which occurred frequently and with some episodes of excessive loss the wastewater that supplied the reactor had a high concentration of oils and greases and in some circumstances the grease retention box was not sufficient for a continuous feeding of the reactor with a low grease concentration wastewater this is very important for systems that receive input from sludge removed from septic tanks leachate from landfills or any other source of contamination that could be detrimental to the formation and maintenance of the granules oil grease and fat free ogf given time and as long as the mixing intensity is sufficient these components are perfectly biodegradable however high concentrations can cause problems in the maintenance of the aerobic granule formation of a scum layer composed of slowly biodegradable material floating in the liquid phase excessive energy consumption due to excess aeration deficiency in nutrient removal or development of hydrophobic filaments that attach to air bubbles and float to the reactor surface 42 the particle size analysis indicated the predominance of particles with a diameter of 0 2 2 0 mm in all experimental phases particles larger than 2 0 mm occupied about 5 of the total volume of biomass present in the reactor according to de kreuk et al 15 20 particles with a diameter greater than 0 2 mm can be considered granules whose size can reach up to 6 0 mm therefore particle size analysis reinforces the occurrence of the phenomenon of granulation and its maintenance throughout the experiment further details on the granulation process and the morphological characteristics of the granular sludge used in this study are presented in 8 as a result the reactor sludge presented mean svi30 values between 65 ml g 1 and 92 ml g 1 these values are low and indicate good operating conditions for a flocculated activated sludge but still above the values obtained for granular sludge which can reach values as low as 40 ml g 1 42 the values obtained are coherent in principle with the particle size distribution of the sludge in which a predominance of granules in relation to the flakes was not observed according to van haandel van der lubbe 42 the expected svi5 value for ags is 70 to 80 mg l g 1 and the svi30 is 55 to 60 mg l g 1 the svi5 results present a higher value range than svi30 with average values between 101 ml g 1 and 184 ml g 1 indicating that values were not so close that they could represent a high sedimentation velocity typical of granulated sludge this result is compatible with the intensity of solid wash out with the reactor effluent the maximum concentration of tss in the reactor sludge reached 6 0 kg m 3 an intermediate value between what is applied to flocculated sludge generally less than 4 0 kg m 3 and to granular sludge proposed values around 8 0 kg m 3 the sludge vss tss ratio remained in the range of 0 83 and 0 87 these values are typical of activated sludge with low sludge age a situation where there is a higher production of excess sludge and a lower degree of digestion compared to extended aeration systems 3 2 organic matter removal fig 3 presents the concentration time series and box whiskers diagrams of different cod fractions and solids from the influent and effluent wastewater of the ags reactor the reactor effluent scod remained low with mean values of 56 mg l 1 31 mg l 1 and 18 mg l 1 in phase i ii and iii respectively these results demonstrate high efficiency in the flocculation or granulation of wastewater colloidal matter ensuring that the reactor is fully operational in terms of organic compounds oxidation and biomass growth although it was considered that a stabilized regime was reached at each stage the average effluent scod decreased through the phases and in phase iii it was possible to obtain effluent scod as low as expected for this high efficiency treatment modality however the continuous solid wash out from the reactor with the effluent was a distinct feature of the reactor operation throughout the three operational phases the mean concentration of tss in the treated wastewater ranged between 66 and 119 mg l 1 in the second stage there were episodes in which the effluent presented higher tss and vss values this is due to operational variability notably at the beginning of the change in operational strategy 3 h to 4 h during this period there were episodes with maximum tss and vss values of 1041 mg l 1 and 470 mg l 1 as shown in fig 3 b in these cases intentional sludge disposal was not performed for srt control however we emphasize that these were sporadic episodes and that the system operated with a mean tss of 119 mg l 1 fig 3 and that the srt was controlled as the dragged sludge was predominantly volatile the increase in cod in the treated wastewater was substantial with the tcod vss ratio of the phase ii effluent resulting in 1 39 kg cod kg vss 1 day 1 comparing all phase s results the tcod vss ratio of phase ii represents the closest value to the theoretical prediction of 1 48 kg cod kg vss 1 day 1 43 controlling the loss of solids with the effluent is essential for the reactor operation and it needs to be achieved even in the situations where the feed characteristics are more favorable otherwise standards for disposal under more restrictive wastewater conditions can only be achieved through effluent filtration a relatively complex and costly operation in addition it is not possible to exert hydraulic control of the sludge age in the present study the sludge age was determined considering the intentionally discarded sludge from the reactor the solid loss with the effluent and the surface accumulated and overflowed scum these last two parcels proved to be significant in this work the pilot scale unit was sized to ensure greater representativeness of results than bench scale studies and fed by real sewage it was possible to more closely represent the possibilities of occurrence in a real wwtp in which conditions are less controlled than bench scale reactors fed by synthetic substrate under constant flow the use of small volume reactors fed by synthetic substrate constitutes a large part of the works on snd in the ags found in the literature in relation to the influent cod it is observed in fig 3 a greater dispersion of results in phase i compared to the others in all phases the influent scod values showed a more uniform and narrow variation range as it was expected there was a reduction in the influent cod from the first to the third phase but this effect was eliminated by the effective control of the f m ratio with the feed flow being increased to compensate the lower cod concentration of the wastewater as the proper cod load was always maintained to allow sufficient sludge growth to produce the 8 day sludge wastewater mass regarding the characteristics of the reactor effluent the most important thing in the time series analysis is that tss wash out with the effluent occurred continuously and equalized throughout the experiment with no defined trend of increase or reduction over time indicating that the results are not just isolated episodes of large losses therefore the cod values of the effluent followed this behavior and it was significantly increased by the particulate fraction which greatly reduced the quality of the treated wastewater although there is a need to correct this operational problem the effects of this phenomenon on nitrogen removal are small affecting only the behavior of the particulate organic fraction and it does not significantly interfere with the conclusions of this study on nitrogen removal in general the box whiskers diagrams in fig 3 indicate that in all phases the effluent vss varied within a not very wide range likewise it is observed in fig 3 that the effluent scod also varied within a narrow range of relatively low values pronk et al 12 performed a study at wwtp garmerwolde in the netherlands with an ags process treating 28 600 m3 day 1 during dry weather flow the reactors had a robust and stable granular sludge bed with more than 8 0 g tss l 1 and svi5 of 45 ml g 1 consisted of more than 80 of granules larger than 0 2 mm and more than 60 larger than 1 mm the authors reported that it was possible to reach an effluent with an average of only 20 mg tss l 1 demonstrating that it is possible to contain the excessive solid wash out in wwtp with ags therefore in the present study it was necessary to identify the influent wastewater characteristics or operational conditions that hinder the formation of a greater quantity of particles with more favorable sedimentability 3 3 nitrogen removal nitrogen removal and its mechanisms are directly associated with the main objective of this work and its results will be discussed individually by phase 3 3 1 phase i nitrogen removal the results obtained in phase i are represented in fig 4 as time series and box whiskers diagrams there is a relatively high mean concentration of tkn in the reactor influent wastewater around 90 mg n l 1 where 60 mg n l 1 correspond to the ammoniacal fraction since the mean cod in phase i resulted in 900 mg l 1 where around 300 mg l 1 correspond to the soluble fraction the tkn tcod ratio resulted in 0 10 and the tkn scod ratio in 0 30 this information is important for the assessment of denitrification capacity it is observed in fig 4 that the wastewater nitrification occurred with high intensity since the average concentration of ammonia nitrogen in the reactor influent wastewater was 61 mg n l 1 and in the reactor effluent it was 8 mg n l 1 constituting more than 50 mg n l 1 of effectively oxidized ammonia to this amount it must be added the portion of tkn converted to ammonia the high concentration of tkn in the reactor effluent an average of 27 mg n l 1 was largely due to the organic nitrogen present in suspended solid particles washed out with the reactor effluent as described by von sperling 44 organic nitrogen is one of the constituents of suspended solids and dissolved solids tkn can be further subdivided in a soluble fraction dominated by ammonia and a particulate fraction associated with the organic suspended solids nitrogen participates in the constitution of practically all forms of particulate organic matter in sewage 44 the denitrification process conversely showed instability with situations of high efficiency and of high concentration of nitrite or nitrate in the effluent with values of 24 mg n l 1 and 18 mg n l 1 respectively as shown in fig 4 the results in fig 4 also show that in this case the wastewater nitrification process has the potential to consume practically all the alkalinity present in the wastewater and the possibility of artificial correction should be ensured when there is a tendency for a ph decrease to the point of concern for the development of the various biochemical processes involved to accomplish a mass balance based on fig 4 results it is considered that the working volume of the reactor is 0 8 m3 and that the average concentration of vss recorded in phase i is around 3 0 kg m 3 table 3 resulting a mass of vss in the reactor of mxv 0 8 3 0 2 4 kg vss it is also considered that the food microorganisms food mass ratio corresponding to the 8 day sludge is around 1 0 kg cod kg vss day 1 and the applied cod load results in 1 0 2 4 2 4 kg cod day 1 since the mean wastewater cod concentration is around 0 9 kg m 3 fig 3 the mean reference wastewater discharge is 2 4 0 9 2 7 m3 day 1 in order to maintain the 8 day sludge age the amount of excess sludge to be discarded mxv rs is δxv 2 4 8 0 3 kg vss day 1 as the mean tkn concentration of the influent in phase i is 88 mg n l 1 and the ammonia nitrogen concentration of the effluent is 8 mg n l 1 fig 4 the amount of nitrified nitrogen results in δn nitrif 88 8 10 3 2 7 0 1 0 3 10 3 69 mg n l 1 this means that the system had a high nitrification capacity for this nitrification potential to be exerted the expected alkalinity consumption is based on the process stoichiometry without considering alkalinity replacement via denitrification 7 14 69 490 mg caco3 l 1 as the total alkalinity of the wastewater is 225 mg caco3 l 1 fig 4 the need for artificial introduction of alkalinity is evident in order to guarantee the functioning of the system even if there is a damage to the denitrification process the potential to nitrify about 69 mg n l 1 results in the generation of nitrate in equally high concentrations so that limitations in denitrification may occur due to the lack of readily biodegradable carbon since the scod of the wastewater fig 3 is only around 300 mg l 1 analyzing the ammonia nitrogen concentrations in the reactor effluent it is observed in fig 4 a that the nitrification occurred satisfactorily with large amounts of ammonia oxidized and with a low concentration of this constituent in the treated wastewater almost invariably throughout phase i the most important thing to be observed in this fig 4 a is the accumulation of nitrite that occurred in the reactor effluent practically during all phase i period with concentrations in the range between 10 mg n l 1 and 24 mg n l 1 approximately this clearly indicates the blocking of nitration resulting in a highly difficult problem for the discharge of treated wastewater the nitrate concentration also increased excessively especially in the period between the 120th day of operation and the end of phase i distinctively indicating that denitrification did not take place satisfactorily since there was no replacement of a significant alkalinity portion by a successful denitrification practically all the alkalinity of the wastewater was consumed as can be seen in fig 4 a artificial alkalinity replacement was only sufficient to prevent acute drops in ph values which effectively did not occur layer et al 36 supplied 13 l sbr ags columns with synthetic substrate raw and decanted wastewater the total duration of a cycle was 5 6 h of which 1 5 h was reserved for anaerobic feeding in a plug flow regime and 4 0 h for the aerobic phase the do concentration during the aerobic phase was controlled at a set point of 2 0 mg o2 l 1 constant do as in the present work but with low concentration wastewater the authors concluded that the occurrence of snd was limited which led to a low tn removal efficiency resulting in effluent with high tn and nox the efficiency obtained from snd was 61 5 14 1 the authors conclude that it was necessary to modify the aeration strategy to increase the efficiency of the system for nitrogen removal an interesting aspect observed in fig 4 b is the relatively high concentration range in which the reactor effluent tkn varied although this fact can be easily justified by the presence of organic nitrogen associated with washed out vss with the reactor effluent no direct correlation was observed between the results of these two quantities during phase i also in fig 4 b the large consumption of alkalinity caused by wastewater nitrification is confirmed 3 3 2 phase ii nitrogen removal the results obtained in phase ii are plotted in fig 5 in the form of time series fig 5 a and box whiskers diagrams fig 5 b in phase ii the reactor influent wastewater presented an average tkn concentration around 60 mg n l 1 with 40 mg n l 1 of ammonia nitrogen these results are about 35 lower than the respective ones obtained in phase i a favorable fact for the nitrification denitrification reactions to be completed as the reduction in wastewater cod occurred proportionally to the tkn the tkn tcod ratio remained around 0 10 it is also observed in fig 5 b that the nitrogen transformation processes occurred in phase ii in order to produce effluent with 12 mg n l 1 of tkn and 5 mg n l 1 of ammonia nitrogen lower values than those obtained in phase i knowing that in phase ii the solid wash out with the effluent persisted the efficiency obtained from snd was 79 4 28 3 despite the significant reduction in the concentrations of tkn and ammonia nitrogen as in phase i the removal of nitrogen presented instability with situations of high nitrite or nitrate concentrations in the effluent with values of 26 mg n l 1 and around 17 mg n l 1 respectively as shown in fig 5 these results are a major concern especially in relation to the accumulation of nitrite in the effluent regarding the alkalinity results presented in fig 5 it can be stated that the mass balance presented for phase i occurred approximately without changes in relation to phase i in which the lowest average alkalinity consumption in phase ii is considered as a function of the lower tkn concentration of the influent in fig 5 a the concentrations of ammonia nitrogen in the reactor effluent remained low throughout phase ii indicating that the nitrification process occurred satisfactorily analyzing the nitrate concentrations in fig 5 a this constituent was also well controlled during phase ii and the effluent almost invariably presented values below 10 mg n l 1 which is an acceptable value for any wastewater discharge condition in brazil indicating a successful denitrification process however unfortunately it was also observed in phase ii the occurrence of nitrite accumulation distributed over the entire cycle and with the occurrence of very high and impeding values for various discharge conditions knowing that the limits for nitrite in natural waters are more restrictive than those for nitrate this results matches with others studies such as pronk et al 12 liu et al 11 and cetin et al 9 in general the reactor with ags presented similar behavior to phase i in terms of nitrogen removal in fig 5 b the same situation that occurred in phase i can be noted with practically total consumption of the natural alkalinity present in the reactor influent wastewater the diagrams in fig 5 b show that the reactor effluent tkn is significantly affected by the wash out of solids in conclusion the modification introduced from phase i to phase ii a proposed new operational scheme allowing more time for biochemical processes to occur did not produce the desired effects although coincidentally there was a reduction in the influent tkn in relation to phase i this finding supported the development of phase iii 3 3 3 phase iii nitrogen removal the results obtained in phase iii will be first analyzed based on fig 6 in which they are presented in the form of time series plots in fig 6 tkn results for the reactor influent range between 60 mg n l 1 and 80 mg n l 1 intermediate values in relation to phase i higher results and phase ii lower results it is also observed in fig 6 that the reactor influent ammoniacal nitrogen concentration range between 40 mg n l 1 and 60 mg n l 1 approximately the mean cod in phase iii resulted in 540 mg l 1 of which around 270 mg l 1 correspond to the soluble fraction the average concentration of influent tkn is 72 mg n l 1 44 mg n l 1 of ammonia nitrogen in phase iii the tkn tcod ratio resulted in 0 13 and the tkn scod ratio in 0 26 not presenting significant changes in relation to the other phases observing the effluent ammonia concentrations low values are frequently observed throughout phase iii indicating that under ammonia nitrogen reduction the wastewater nitrification process occurred satisfactorily however when observing the results of nitrite and nitrate in the effluent two periods are distinguished initially high concentrations of these anions were observed until the 70th day of operation of phase iii approximately after that these concentrations were very well controlled as can be seen in fig 6 these findings led to a change in the operational procedure of phase iii replacing the previous intermittent regime in the interruption of aeration of 5 min after 20 min for a new interruption regime of 15 min after 60 min this last condition was considered the most favorable and it was capable of eliminating the problem of nitrite and nitrate accumulation in the effluent so it was maintained until the end of the experiment fig 6 presents the statistical parameters related to the results obtained in phase iii only after the establishment of the 15 min aeration arrest regime every 60 min of operation the mean concentrations of ammonia nitrite and nitrate in the reactor effluent resulted respectively in 4 3 mg n l 1 0 4 mg n l 1 and 5 5 mg n l 1 with reasonably low standard deviations these values indicate that the imposition of an intermittent regime in the ags aeration results in an effluent with high quality in terms of the low concentrations of the various forms of nitrogen making this wastewater treatment process available for situations with stricter restrictions on these chemical species analyzing fig 6 no characteristics of the effluent or of the biological reactor varied in relation to the previous phases this fact ensures that the improvement in nitrogen removal was due to the imposition of intermittence in the aeration and these results are compatible with that reported by hu et al 38 the results in fig 6 also show that the wastewater nitrification process under these conditions in which denitrification is practically complete has the potential to consume all the alkalinity present in the wastewater and it ensures the possibility of artificially introducing alkalinity to avoid instability in reactor sludge ph values huang et al 28 compared the application of a cycle with continuous aeration for 320 min where two aeration arrest were applied the first one for 60 min after 90 min of aeration and the second one for 75 min after 60 min subsequently the first arrest they used a reactor with a working volume of 4 27 l supplied with synthetic substrate the results showed that with continuous aeration 99 of nh4 and 80 of total nitrogen tn were removed while with intermittent aeration the removal efficiency of nh4 was 100 and of tn was 98 despite the differences in the objective and the conditions imposed in relation to the present study this comparison confirmed that working with real wastewater and on a larger scale the intermittency in the aeration tends to increase the efficiency of the process with ags in the removal of nitrogen in the previously mentioned work that was developed at wwtp garmerwolde 12 they provided a recycle from the top to the bottom for maximizing nitrogen removal operating with intermittent aeration the dissolved oxygen concentration was maintained between 1 8 and 2 5 mg l 1 during aeration periods according to the authors the effluent requirements of 7 mg n l 1 and 1 mg p l 1 were easily met this demonstrates that the effects of the application of intermittent aeration are of practical recognition but it is necessary to produce subsidies for the definition of applicable conditions to wastewaters produced under particular conditions in different regions 3 4 evaluation of nitrification denitrification process through concentration profiles in order to enhance the knowledge about the nitrogen transformations in the ags process determinations of the different constituents were carried out every 15 min along typical sequential batches of each experimental phase 3 4 1 phase i concentration profile the average results obtained from the concentration profile surveys throughout phase i are presented in fig 7 fig 7 shows that the dissolved oxygen concentration do in the ags was kept high during the aeration period the ammonia concentration decreases continuously throughout the aeration period and the alkalinity consumption follows this reduction it is also explicitly observed a nitrite and nitrate accumulation being formed in the nitrification under aeration demonstrating that there are no conditions for denitrification during this stage of the cycle which do not characterize simultaneous nitrification and denitrification snd the efficiency obtained from snd was 63 2 29 6 the nitrite and nitrate partial residuals from the previous cycle are diluted by the wastewater entrance and partially used for denitrification during the filling period which behaved as anoxic and not as anaerobic thus the concentrations of these ions at the beginning of aeration are not very high but they tend to increase during this period demonstrating that denitrification did not occur simultaneously with nitrification at least not in the same proportion this could be expected due to the high concentrations of do for a granular sludge but with particles with an average diameter slightly greater than 0 2 mm that is not very high 3 4 2 phase ii concentration profile the average results obtained in the concentration profile surveys throughout phase ii are presented in fig 8 by observing the concentration profiles shown in fig 8 it is concluded that the general behavior in phase ii was similar to phase i the main difference in phase ii is that the accumulation of nitrate during the aeration period was greater than in phase i making the nitrate concentrations at the beginning of the aeration period also higher due to the lower performance of the feeding period as a denitrification chamber 3 4 3 phase iii concentration profile the average results obtained in the concentration profile surveys throughout phase iii are presented in fig 9 as shown in fig 9 the concentration profiles in phase iii demonstrate the beneficial effects of imposing intermittent aeration on nitrogen removal which matches others studies 23 28 38 ammonia consumption occurred at a very high rate and as aeration was arrested denitrification was carried out controlling the residuals of nitrite and nitrate thus at the end of the aeration period ammonia nitrite and nitrate had low concentrations providing favorable characteristics for the effluent and for the liquid that remains in the reactor to receive a new load of wastewater in the next cycle that is the reactor achieved a dynamic balance that ensured stable operating conditions and satisfactory performance of the treatment system another aspect that draws attention is the fact that the possibility of reducing these compounds is obtained in a short period of time this shows that the operating cycle can be optimized and conducted based on the desired residual of these compounds it is not part of this work but the reduction of nitrite or nitrate concentrations to very low levels are necessary so that the feed period of the reactor with the wastewater effectively integrates the system as an anaerobic chamber acting in the biochemical mechanisms of phosphorus removal 4 conclusion in phase i the system was operated on a pilot scale with cycles of 3 h of total duration with continuous aeration and other conditions despite the treatment of a relatively concentrated wastewater in a hot climate region the ags was efficient in removing soluble organic matter and in wastewater nitrification but excessive wash out of tss occurred with the effluent and the denitrification process was incomplete highlighting the occurrence of nitrite accumulation in phase ii the total cycle duration was increased to 4 h but the continuous aeration regime was maintained there was no substantial change in the reactor behavior and the problem of nitrite accumulation persisted demonstrating that the main cause was not the shortage of reaction time whether in anoxic or aerobic conditions the problem of excessive wash out of tss with the effluent also persisted raising the level of concern with this phenomenon which extended throughout the operation of the pilot unit even though effective control was exerted over the age of the sludge in phase iii it was maintained the 4 h cycle used in phase ii but it was implemented an intermittent regime in the air supply for the ags reactor the system maintained the desired efficiency in removing soluble organic matter the nitrification process was practically completed resulting in low residual concentrations of ammoniacal nitrogen in the treated wastewater the efficiency in denitrification increased significantly with no more nitrate and nitrate accumulation whose concentrations were always kept low in the treated wastewater in conclusion this study demonstrates that for the conditions in which it was applied the imposition of an intermittency regime in the air supply is of great importance to obtain an efficient nitrogen removal in an ags system the identification of the concentration profiles of the nitrogen species over the course of some batches clearly demonstrated the occurrence of snd when there is intermittent ags aeration since the residuals of nitrite and nitrate that were formed during the aeration were immediately consumed in denitrification and kept low during the course of the aeration stage but snd although prevalent has not been shown to be the exclusive nitrogen removal mechanism as the residual nitrite and nitrate at the end of a batch were further used during the anaerobic anoxic filling period credit authorship contribution statement

13219,lead pollution has taken immense consideration of the industrialists environmentalists policymakers and health workers due to its public health concerns the wastewater generated from the industries has a noteworthy role in lead pb ii contamination to the environment in addition to human health concerns pb ii has a considerable dilemma on the vegetation and fauna of the environment and can inadequately manipulate the intact ecosystem due to its terrible toxicity after getting contaminated with pb ii researchers have explored several ways to combat to pb ii contamination problem the entire techniques explored at present are not suitable in the aspects of sustainability and eco friendliness and thus cleaner strategies are going to be dominated over other techniques in shortly noon this aspect is lacking in the literature and hence covered in this review to ease the difficulties of the industrialists environmentalists and policymakers in finding such cleaner and ecofriendly techniques thus we primarily intended to emphasize the cleaner and advanced techniques for treatment of pb ii containing industrial wastewater therefore cleaner and advanced techniques including integrated combined technologies are critically discussed in this review the recent development in the cleaner strategies has also been explained well the pb ii water contamination sources and its toxicity to human health and plants are also elucidated in this paper for a healthier understanding of pb ii contagion annoyance graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords lead toxicity adsorption biological treatment gel technique integrated treatment method membrane filtration 1 introduction industrial and developmental activities raise the overexploitation of natural recourses and produce various types of organic and inorganic pollutants into the environment through generated effluents generally produced effluents are highly polluted with heavy metal other inorganic and organic contaminants and dumped into the aquatic bodies through small water channels which disturb the whole aquatic ecosystem inadequately this can also contaminate the groundwater via percolation with the groundwater recharge process heavy metal water contamination is become a serious issue at present due to human health and environmental concerns amid heavy metals pb ii is one of the most imperative and employed in different industries including electroplating paint steel battery smelting inorganic fertilizers and pesticides 1 2 pb ii has high toxic mutagenic and carcinogenic potential and causes several types of metabolic and physiological disorders in humans animals and plants due to its dreadful negative consequences the world health organization who and the bureau of indian standard bis is 3025 have set the permissible limit 0 01 mg l 3 310 in the substance priority list spl it has been priorities as 2nd substance by the agency for toxic substances and disease registry atsdr united states environmental protection agency us epa 4 international agency for research on cancer iarc who has recognized lead inorganic compound as group 2a carcinogen probably carcinogenic to humans 5 while 14th report on carcinogens of national toxicological program ntp u s department of health and human services us dhhs 6 has categorized lead and lead compound as reasonably anticipated to be human carcinogens natural sources such as lead containing rock weathering and volcanic eruptions are also the sources of lead contamination of the environment air water and soil in addition to anthropogenic sources industrial processes developmental activities and agricultural practices the major sources of water contamination are the industrial process such as paint electroplating battery smelting mining etc which generate a huge amount of pb ii polluted wastewater and disposed of in the land field and water bodies after contamination pb ii can manipulate the land and water ecosystem inadequately due to its extremely toxic and carcinogenic behavior pb ii and its compound have serious human health concerns in addition to ecosystem disturbance by affecting the flora and fauna of the ecosystem thus pb ii contamination is a serious issue and its removal from industrial wastewater is a challenge for industrialists environmentalists as well as health and environment concerned governmental organizations and policymakers there are plentiful efforts have been made by the researcher in diverse ways to eliminate pb ii from contaminated industrial wastewater here the most recent cleaner and advanced technologies have been focused on and reviewed from the industrial wastewater treatment perspective the effect of pb ii on human health and plants as well as its sources and chemistry is also well discussed in this paper 2 chemical characteristics of lead and its sources in water lead is tedious silvery grey metal squashy simply worked into sheets and is the 38th richest element in the earth s crust 7 lead is symbolized with pb from latin plumbum its atomic number is 82 relative atomic mass 207 2 and belongs to the p block in the periodic table its electronic configuration is xe 4f14 5d10 6s2 6p2 lead in its compound is commonly occurred with the oxidation state of 2 and 4 its high density 11 3 g cm 3 results from its close packed face centered cubic structure and high atomic mass 8 due to its low melting point 327 462 c ductility high density and relative inertness to oxidation state it is exploited for different purposes it is used in the manufacturing of lead acid battery and due to corrosion resistant it is applied in pipes paint and pigments and pewter it is also employed in fusible alloys ionizing radiation shielding lead crystal glasses which contain 12 28 lead oxide solder for electronic use and in leaded gasoline as an anti knowing additive 9 lead has also been used in pesticides hair dyes and other cosmetics ammunition glaze for pottery and lead pots used for storage of corrosive liquids however some of these uses have been banned in several countries manufacturing of these products at a large level in the industries generates a huge amount of highly lead polluted wastewater fig 1 10 in wastewater stream it normally occurs in its 2 oxidation state pb ii however wastewater generated from battery manufacturing paint pigment manufacturing and electroplating industries its concentration varied from 1 to 50 mg l 1 25 mg l and 8 10 mg l respectively 11 13 lead is mostly extracted from galena pbs lead sulfide by the roasting process which also generates plenty amount of pb ii contaminated wastewater 14 lead and lead oxides react with acid excluding phosphoric and sulfuric acid and base and it is inclined to form a covalent bond pb ii ions are typically colorless in water and partly hydrolyze in pb oh and finally form pb4 oh 4 4 where hydroxyl ions work as bridging ligands 15 16 its sulfate salt is insoluble in water while lead nitrate pb no3 2 and lead acetate pb ch3coo 2 are highly soluble in water and purposively used for the synthesis of other lead s compounds its most frequently known inorganic tetravalent oxidation state carrying compound is lead tetraoxide red lead pb3o4 which of one lead atom has a 4 oxidation state and two of them have 2 oxidation states 17 however in the organic metallic compound lead mostly occur in its 4 oxidation state and well known forms of organolead are tetramethyl lead pb ch3 4 and tetraethyllead pb c2h5 4 which are easily decomposed when come under the sunlight and ultraviolet rays 18 in the areas where soft or acidic water occurs that can cause lead contamination via dissolution of lead in acidic water if supplied through the lead pipe while hard water forms an insoluble layer on the pipe similarly oxygenated water may also result in pb ii contamination by dissolving as lead oxide 19 the presence of pb ii can be easily detected by its precipitation with dilute hydrochloric acid hcl solution as lead chloride pb cl 2 precipitate scarcely soluble in water and its dilute solution with bubbling of hydrogen sulfide h2s form lead sulfide pbs precipitate 20 3 toxicity of lead lead is one of the most toxic elements when comes inside the body via inhalation and ingestion with sources such as food and lead dust etc absorbed and accumulates in blood bones liver kidney brain and skin fig 2 it has no known biological function although its organolead compounds such as tetraethyl lead are absorbed in the digestive system and get distributed to the whole body within hours and vitamin c facilitates its absorption in the digestive tract 21 22 lead induced reactive oxygen species ros production inside the cell is one of its major toxicity mechanisms ros include hydroxyl radical oh superoxide ion o2 nascent oxygen atom o etc that results in oxidative stress and can oxidize membrane lipid protein dna and other macromolecules and disrupt the cell functioning normally lead affects the metabolic processes by inhibiting the enzymatic function via replacing the cationic species from enzymes and can disturb the whole metabolic functioning in the blood it can inhibit the heme synthesis can interfere with the red blood corpuscles rbcs and erythrocytes membrane by oxidative damages make it more fragile them and cause hemolysis and ultimately anemia 23 26 pb ii can induce multiple types of gene expression in human cells such as protein kinase activity metallothionein expression and the expression of cellular metabolic enzymes and have also seen its impact on several neuron signaling pathways 27 in adults the peripheral nervous system pns and in the child the central nervous system cns is most sensitive to lead induced toxicity 311 313 brain of childs under the age of six years is more susceptible to lead toxicity due to rapid growth and development of the brain at this age low level 5 μg dl of lead can reduce the intellectual and academic performance hyperactivity attention disorder and low birth weight in children while increase blood lead level up to 100 μg dl causes obvious symptoms such as protracted vomiting and encephalopathy and even death 28 lead induced oxidative stress can kill neurons by exciting the forkhead box class o transcription factor foxo3 an essential component in the cell life death pathway 29 30 generally 80 85 of total absorbed lead gets deposited in bones works as a reservoir for lead 31 and can disturb the bone formation and development process as reported in model organisms 32 lead has potential immune toxicity via generating ros in neutrophils and can expression of interferon gamma inducible gtpases p47 irg and p65 gbp essential for intracellular pathogen killing 33 increased blood lead level bll can also affect the renal system liver and gastrointestinal tract by impairing the enzymatic structure and functions 314 in males increased bll may affect male fertility by affecting motility morphology and other functional parameters of sperm and decreasing sperm count while the increased seminal lead level can cause dna fragmentation 34 35 elevated bll in females may result in a high risk of miscarriage premature rupture of membrane etc 36 37 lead toxicity causes severe impacts on plants can affect the nutrient uptake alter the plant water relation and generate ros inside cells that results in the reduction in photosynthesis activity growth and development process and also affect the productivity of crops 38 40 lead contamination hinders the germination and growth of seedlings by affecting many types of enzymes activity such as α amylase β amylase protease acid phosphatase and acid invertase which are associated with carbohydrates and protein metabolism 41 42 it can also damage the mitochondrial structure in root meristematic cells and break biological membrane cause loss of cristae dictyosomes and endoplasmic reticulum with 2 3 days of exposure 43 its toxic effects also have been reported on transpiration chlorophyll synthesis cell division and shoot and root development 44 45 lead induced generated ros damage the protein lipid and nucleotides and cause oxidative damages in response to elevated ros several types of enzymatic and non enzymatic antioxidants are produced in plant cells to reduce the oxidative stress which includes proline glutathione catalase peroxidase superoxide dismutase glutathione oxidase and reductase ascorbic acid glutathione s transferase which alleviate the lead toxicity but excess concentration cause multiple types of alteration in plants morphology physiology and biochemical processes 2 46 48 lead toxicity can hamper the carotenoids plastoquinone and electron transport chain etc impair the enzyme function and affect the co2 fixation 49 it also increases the synthesis and activity of chlorophyllase cause chlorophyll breakdown into mg phytol and porphyrin rings 50 moreover reduction in the activity of ferredoxin nadp reductase and delta aminolevulinic acid dehydratase alad under the presence of pb ii can inhibit the chlorophyll synthesis process 51 in c3 plants pb ii exposure disturbs the ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase activity that reduces the co2 assimilation in c3 cycle 52 its exposure increase respiration rate and increases the adenosine triphosphate atp production which confirmed the high energy demand to conquer the toxic effect of pb ii 53 54 4 cleaner treatment techniques heavy metal pollution has become a serious environmental concern at present conventionally the heavy metal contaminated water and wastewater including pb ii is treated by various physicochemical treatment techniques these techniques include chemical precipitation coagulation flocculation adsorption and filtration chemical based treatment techniques are the most employed techniques and are being used for the removal of pb ii and other heavy metals pollutants from wastewater 55 56 these chemical based processes have several disadvantages since they require a huge amount of reagents energy inputs need for skilled operators disposal of toxic waste sludge produced during the process the generated sludge wastes have a huge impact on the environment due to potential ecological risks the environmental concern of these treatment options raises the demand for cleaner treatment processes that are environmentally friendly and sustainable 55 60 several treatment techniques have been investigated in various studies that have the potential to treat pb ii contaminated industrial wastewater in cleaner ways these cleaner techniques can reduce the environmental problems that are associated with chemical based treatment techniques these techniques may produce less amount of sludge require less quantity of chemical generate less toxic waste and do not necessitate high input of energy and skilled manpower as compared to chemical based treatment options these cleaner techniques include membrane filtration adsorption electrochemical hydrogel photocatalysis biological and bio integrated treatment techniques which have been critically discussed in this section 4 1 electrocoagulation electrocoagulation ec process is widely adopted as a cleaner strategy that can eliminate toxic metals suspended solids organic contaminants and microorganisms from wastewater ec combines the coagulation flotation and electrochemistry and expels the particle from the wastewater by weakening the power and remaining the particle suspended in wastewater fig 4a table 1 72 74 300 in the ec process coagulating ions are produced on the sacrificial electrode which destabilizes the dissolved suspended and emulsified contaminants from an aqueous medium by neutralizing the charge and aggregate to form flocs 72 73 75 the high electricity consumption of the ec process has limited its use due to high operational costs 75 in an investigation the ec process was employed for removing metal ions including pb ii using an iron electrode the functional parameters such as ph internal electrode distance current density charging time and solution temperature were considered for the study and under the optimized conditions pb ii removal reached 98 5 315 in the removal of pb ii basically two types of electrodes have been studied iron electrode and aluminium electrode both of the electrodes have been reported to have huge potential for pb ii removal from wastewater 66 67 for instance kamaraj et al 66 67 studied the removal performance of the ec process for pb ii in the ec process galvanized iron and magnesium were used as cathode and anode respectively and achieved maximum removal of 99 3 at ph 7 0 with a current density of 0 8 a dm2 with an energy utilization of 0 72 kwh m3 the autocatalytic behavior of the ec reactor is also found as an effective process in removing pb ii aljaberi 316 constructed triple aluminium tubes in a concentric manner putting the cathode in the middle of the anode electrode they stated that ec reactor was worked as an autocatalytic reactor and improved the kinetic and adsorption process and successfully pb ii removal was recorded the electrocoagulation electroflotaion integrated process has also been reported for the treatment of different types of contaminant polluted wastewater including pb ii 74 besides aluminium electrodes other electrodes like zinc electrodes are also being used in the ec process and proficient results have been recorded 10 69 another progress that has been achieved in previous studies is the use of renewable electricity sources solar energy is one of the renewable energy resources enabling cleaner techniques than other conventional techniques 69 76 in a study the electrocoagulation process powered by a solar photovoltaic system was used for pb ii removal from contaminated water to reduce the cost and improve the system efficiency 10 in the system perforated zinc was utilized as a novel anode electrode for the analysis electrode materials electrode geometry and energy consumption were considered at a current density of 1 13 ma cm2 the removal rate of pb ii was 99 9 within 10 min 10 hussin et al 69 combined the solar electrocoagulation with the adsorption process for pb ii removal where perforated zinc was used as an electrode in the system ec process occurred on the upper part of the system while adsorption reaction at bottom of the reactor and pb ii was successfully removed from the water zinc electrode involved following electrochemical reactions at the anode 1 zn zn 2 2e at the cathode 2 2h 2 o l 2e h 2 g 2oh overall reaction 3 zn 2 aq 2h 2 o l zn oh 2 2h l 4 2 electrodialysis electrodialysis is an electro active process widely used for the treatment of wastewater generally for desalination of metal polluted water 77 in the process a voltage applied between the electrodes cathode and anode passing through ion exchange membrane iem is used in electrodialysis ed cell to remove the charged pollutants from neutral aqueous solution fig 4b 77 299 this process is especially more impressive for the separation of selective ions using specific types of iems sajjad et al 2020 but again the electricity consumption limits its use these days various improvements have been done in the ec process to advance the process efficiency and most of them are centered on iems modification nemati et al 78 prepared a novel heterogeneous ion exchange membrane for the exclusion of pb2 and some other metal ions was highly effective for the separation of pb ii and other cations and the separation efficiency was 99 9 for pb2 ions from the solution chemical modification of iems work and can improve system efficiency hosseini et al 79 fabricated mixed matrix electrodialysis heterogeneous iem using polyaniline pani co graphene oxide go functionalized composite nanoplates by polymerization of aniline with the presence of graphene oxide having high surface hydrophilicity ion exchange capacity and water content transport number membrane potential and selectivity this modification enhanced the pb ii flux by 50 as compared to pristine one it is also being reported in the studies that combining the ed process with other techniques can give excellent performance hamane et al 80 combined the adsorption with photo electrodialysis for removal of pb reduced the pb ii to threshold limit via a combination of this process in the process algerian bentonite was used as an adsorbent and achieved 90 removal and 30 and 80 of the remaining pb ii was dropped to threshold by the photo electrodialysis system under artificial light and sunlight respectively 4 3 electrodeposition electrodeposition is a striking technique broadly applied for the removal recovery of metal from water and wastewater this technique is also used for plating and decorating objects for different purposes in the electrodeposition process the material applied for depositing the metal controlled its efficiency influence the dendrites formation side reaction incidence evolution of h2 and process stability 81 83 in a study two hydrotalcite like compounds were prepared and used as a substrate for the removal recovery of pb ii and cd ii from water 81 by deposition on hydrotalcite electrode almost 100 removal was recorded for pb ii while removal happened via two parallel mechanisms adsorption and electrodeposition 81 recently zhang et al 84 89 developed bioelectrochemically assisted electrodeposition bes edp system for the removal of pb ii from smelting wastewater the system was consisted of two chambers and partitioned with an anionic exchange membrane carbon brush and graphite were used as anode and cathode that were connected with an external circuit the anodic chamber was inoculated with the sludge from the wastewater treatment plant in the results they found that at a cathodic potential of 0 75 v vs ag agcl the removal of pb ii was 98 within 10 h of reaction time it was also found that metal oxides were also formed during pb ii reduction that affects the electrodeposition process 4 4 electrochemical technique electrochemical technique widely utilized for removal degradation pesticides dyes pharmaceutics antibiotic and heavy metal contaminants in the electrochemical process pollutants are destroyed by direct or indirect oxidation reduction redox mechanisms 90 92 the majority of recent developments on pb ii removal by electrochemical process were focused to advance the electrode of the electrochemical system in an investigation a porous electroactive composite based film made of core shell nanospheres as high crystalline protonated zeolite socony mobil 5 hzsm 5 polyaniline polystyrene hzsm 5 pani pss composite was fabricated the fabricated hzsm 5 pani pss composite film was investigated for the removal of pb2 and showed quick electrochemical uptake and release ability from water due to strong diving force generated from applied electric field 93 vajedi and dehghani 94 examined the titanium dioxide reduced graphene oxide tio2 rgo nanocomposites customized glassy carbon electrode for removal of pb2 and other metal ions from aqueous solution it was found that tio2 rgo 1 1 modified electrode was highly effective for removal of pb2 and other cations as compared to tio2 electrode due to containing both the types of features tio2 and go these days electrochemical based sensor technology is being investigated for sensing pb2 in water and wastewater in the system newly synthesized materials modified electrodes like nanoparticle nanosheet and nanocomposites have been utilized and exhibited excellent sensitivity towards pb ii 95 for instant xu et al 96 99 modified the glassy carbon electrode gce with polypyrrole nanoparticles and polydopamine in the presence of dispersants quaternary ammonium group and lignosulfonate the modified gce showed high sensitivity and selectivity to pb2 in the concentration range from 0 1 to 50 μm and the redox potential was around 0 55 v for pb2 similarly jin et al 100 101 synthesized sns decorated bi2o3 nanosheets heterostructure by a superficial hydro solvothermal approach the synthesized sns bi2o3 nanocomposites exhibit remarkable qualities such as mesoporous channels high surface area and speedy electron transferability for electrochemical reactions in the pb ii detection experiment sns bi2o3 showed improved pb ii detection ability with low lods of 1 40 nm and was effectively utilized for detection of pb ii in tap and lake water some other studies were also investigated sensing performance of electrochemical process using newly synthesized materials modified electrodes such as cezr oxide nanospheres modified glassy carbon electrode cezr oxide gce 95 multilayer bi mofs reduced graphene oxide films modified electrode 102 and porous flower like nio rgo nanocomposite modified glassy carbon electrode sun et al 2020 however the presence of other pollutants in water like hg ii and cu ii can affect the performance and sensing ability of sensors 96 99 4 5 photocatalytic process the photocatalytic process uses light as an energy source for the degradation of the pollutant with the help of photocatalysts semiconductors tio2 and zno are the widely used photocatalyst investigated in many studies for the removal and degradation of pollutants 103 104 this technique is one of the most sustainable and environmentally friendly techniques based on its operation stage though has some environmental concerns at photocatalyst fabrication stages some researchers have tried to remove such complexity by using the green approach 105 106 while this approach is lacking in the case of pb ii removal in a study you et al 107 fabricated bi2o3 tio2 composite by a facile hydrothermal method the prepared bi2o3 tio2 composite was investigated for simultaneous photocatalytic degradation of dibutyl phthalate dbp and removal of pb ii it was found that photoinduced electrons as well as holes separately moved to different ways that cause high availability of photocatalytic reaction locations for reduction of pb ii and dbp degradation fig 3b the fermi levels matching at the n p heterojunction for energy level matching resulted in pb ii reduction into pb 0 on to the bi2o3 tio2 composite in both types of aqueous solution pb ii and pb ii dbp under visible light and the proposed mechanism for pb ii reduction was as eqs 4 11 in another investigation la2o3 modified ceo2 particle was prepared using solid state reaction method at a calcination temperature of 1400 and 1000 c the la2o3 modified ceo2 showed high uv photoelectrochemical removal performance for pb ii also exhibit high visible light absorption ability and higher photoelectrodeposition ability in pb2 ion removal due to formation of n type ceo2 and p type ce0 9la0 1o1 95 hetero junctions in ce0 9la0 1o1 95 ceo2 particles in this process the reduction of pb ii to pb 0 was proposed as eqs 12 to 13 108 4 bi 2 o 3 hv e h 5 pb 2 2e pb 0 6 2h 2 o 4h 4h o 2 7 pb 2 2h 2 o 2h pbo 2 4h 8 2o 2 2e 2 o 2 9 pb 2 2 o 2 pbo 2 o 2 10 pbo 2 2e 2h pbo h 2 o 11 pbo 2e 2h pb 0 h 2 o 12 pb 2 e pb 13 pb e pb 0 histidine his and imidazole im modified tio2 nanoparticles were investigated for the reduction of pb2 and other cations in a study conducted by hosseini and mohebbi 109 the photocatalyzed reduction process of pb2 ions attained 98 removal in 60 min of time duration they stated that modifier hastened the electron transfer from tio2 to pb2 by imidazole bridge with irradiation of uv light and the photoreduction happened sequentially via chemisorptions reduction and desorption process on modified tio2 surface studies also have focused to make photo based systems as a sensor for the detection of pollutants in water and wastewater in a study deshpande et al 110 designed and synthesized a spiropyran based receptor connecting oxygen donor ligands mbsp mbsp was selective for pb2 and by complex formation makes colour change which noticeable by naked eyes which reversible to visible light irradiation this spiropyran based receptor acts as a photo reversible switch for pb2 ions and can detect the least concentration of 4 10 8 m 4 6 membrane filtration membrane filtration is one of the widely used techniques widely used for the removal of different types of contaminants such as organic heavy metal pesticide and microorganisms from drinking water as well as wastewater there are different types of porous and thin film composite membranes that have been used in wastewater treatment these membranes are microfiltration mf ultrafiltration uf nanofiltration nf reverse osmosis ro forward osmosis fo while the principal factors on its selection for treatment of polluted wastewater are size distribution of pore the charge of surface solution flow degree of hydrophilicity and the existence of functional groups that help in the separation of pollutant 111 114 these features can affect the separation efficiency and water production rate of the membrane however in the removal of pb ii uf nf ro fo and adsorptive membrane have been widely studied fig 4c 96 99 115 119 4 6 1 ultrafiltration ultrafiltration membrane has high efficiency in removal of different types of pollutants from wastewater and is considered as a low pressure driven membrane however the size of pb ii cation is slighter than the ultrafiltration membrane pore size pb ii cations easily permeate to uf membrane and it becomes disqualified for pb ii removal 120 122 however chemical modification or blending of parent material with effective material such as nanoparticles graphene oxide organic polymer etc have advanced the uf membrane and turn into an appropriate useful membrane for pb ii exclusion from water 96 99 123 125 such type of modification improves the membrane properties like hydrophilicity porosity pure water flux permeability and rejection ability of the membrane 121 125 for instance xu et al 96 99 synthesized a covalent organic framework cof modified pvdf ultrafiltration membrane and investigated for antifouling properties and pb ii removal ability the cof modified ultrafiltration membrane exhibited remarkable antifouling characteristics and pb ii removal capability 92 4 ravishankar et al 125 prepared a 1 graphene oxide go blended membrane and investigated for rejection of pb ii the membrane showed high hydrophilicity with a contact angle of 34 2 porosity 82 2 pure water flux 163 71 l m2 h and permeability 52 1 l m2 h bar at 3 bar pressure while the pore size of the membrane was in the range of 18 to 24 nm the go 1 blended ultrafiltration membrane successfully rejected pb ii with a rejection efficiency of 98 and flux of 43 62 l m2 h at 1 bar pressure the mechanisms that involve in improving the efficiency of uf are adsorption electrostatic attraction complexation or chemical binding in addition to size exclusion 121 125 126 4 6 2 nanofiltration nanofiltration nf membrane has commendable performance in the separation of heavy metal contaminants including pb ii and has been extensively studied for the treatment of metal contaminated wastewater 116 127 128 membrane modification or fictionalization with specific substances is the foremost modernism in case nf membrane and many types of substances are being used at present these substances includes amino acid polymer organosilica nanoparticle nanofibers etc and an excellent improvement in pb ii removal has been reported using these membranes 118 128 131 in a recent investigation a newly synthesized periodic mesoporous organosilica pmo functionalized with p phenylenediamine ppd incorporated in polyethersulfone pes nf membrane with the modification of 0 25 wt of ppd the pmo ppd membrane pure water flux was 33 7 l m2 h and porosity was 74 1 the mean pore radius was 4 96 nm with a water contact angle of 54 2 and showed high rejection performance for pb ii 93 1 and other contaminants 118 bandehali et al 116 modified the polyetherimide pei based nf membrane with l cysteine functionalized octaglycidyloxypropyl silsesquioxane glycidyl poss nanoparticle with modification pure water flux of pei membrane was increased from 17 63 to 95 l m2 h with an increase in the rejection for pb ii from 44 to 85 several other studies have also reported outstanding nf membrane performance in pb ii rejection 128 132 133 4 6 3 forwards osmosis due to low membrane fouling tendency and low energy consumption properties fo membrane can be potentially used for the treatment of contaminated wastewater 134 136 these days thin film nanocomposite has taken the interest of the researcher for the synthesis of fo membrane 136 137 qiu and he 2019 modification and functionalization are being implemented in the fabrication phase of fo that offers great enhancement in fo properties like porosity hydrophilicity water flux water permeability and salt rejection efficiency 137 138 recently saeedi jurkuyeh et al 137 synthesized thin film nanocomposite tfn fo membrane which included a support layer made up of polysulfone polyethylene glycol 400 and 1 methyl 2 pyrrolidone by phase inversion process the interfacial polymerization reaction was applied to form an active layer by incorporating 1 3 phenylenediamine go and 1 3 5 benzene trichloride into the polyamide layer the prepared tfn fo exhibit excellent fo membrane properties such as higher porosity hydrophilicity water flux water permeability and salt rejection while lower reverse salt flux and internal concentration polarization icp than customary thin film composite tfc in the rejection experiment prepared tfn fo effectively rejected the pb ii from the solution with a rejection rate of 99 9 a nanoporous thin film inorganic tfi fo membrane was developed by you et al 139 also exhibited high rejection performance for heavy metals including pb ii 4 6 4 reverse osmosis out of the various kinds of membranes ro membrane has taken great attention of the researcher investor as well as taking great demand from the public over these years and broadly used for removing total dissolved solids tds heavy metal and other contaminants from drinking water its high pressure driven system uses a semi permeable membrane for the reverse osmosis process to produce fresh water 115 140 142 the combination of reverse osmosis membrane with other membrane processes also has been found as an efficient tool for the treatment recovery of pb ii and other pollutants containing industrial wastewater for example the microfiltration reverse osmosis membrane process was applied for the recovery of water from organized industrial wastewater using reverse osmosis membrane hp bw30 and le at the lab and pilot scale levels the system showed high removal efficiency from wastewater for pb ii 89 3 100 and other pollutants with different ro membranes with a recovery efficiency of 80 however permeate flux was significantly reduced for all the reverse osmosis membranes 140 similarly petrinic et al 317 investigated the ultrafiltration reverse osmosis based uf ro process for the recovery of wastewater from metal finishing industries uf ro system successfully removed different types of pollutants including pb ii from industrial wastewater with efficient recovery of water for reuse purposes since using ro in water and wastewater purification has high efficiency while its primary implementation and maintenance cost and high pressure driven features limit its use and make it unfortunate for large scale applications 4 6 5 adsorptive membrane adsorptive membranes possess dual function features as filtration and adsorption in the removal of pollutants from water and wastewater sometimes it is also known as mixed matrix membrane mmms based on their development fabrication 119 these are derived by blending the polymer with adsorptive nanomaterial during membrane casting these membranes act as adsorptive filters due to containing pore finger like shelf porous interconnected channels for pollutants to pass through and attain the pollutants 119 143 an exploration conducted by koushkbaghi et al 117 incorporated aminated fe3o4 nanoparticles into chitosan polyvinyl alcohol nanofibers over pes polyethersulfonate membrane the aminated fe3o4 nanoparticle mmms successfully applied for adsorptive removal of pb ii and exhibited high reusability in another investigation sun et al 144 grafted ethylene diamine on carboxyl modified multi walled carbon nanotubes mwnts cooh using ion imprinted technology the obtained amino functionalized mwnts mwnts nh2 imprinted with pb ii as pb ii imprinted mwnts and incorporated into pes to get pes pb ii ii imprinted mwnts mmms the obtained mmms exhibited higher antifouling properties and hydrophilicity and showed higher adsorption efficiency for pb ii as well as selective pb ii adsorption capability some other mmms such as pani mcm 41 psf 119 mof 808 embedded nanofibrous membrane 145 and pani go nanoparticles embedded pes membrane 146 also found to have high adsorptive removal efficiency for pb ii electrospun based membranes were also extensively studied and exhibited adsorption features for adsorptive removal of metal including pb ii 147 148 318 4 6 6 other membranes above discussed membrane systems are highly useful for the treatment of pb ii containing wastewater but except these there are some other membranes that were also investigated for the separation of pb ii from impure water recently liu et al 149 prepared a new polyethyleneimine pei conjugated amyloid lysozyme fibrils afl pei membrane and investigated for the removal of pb ii the afl pei membrane exhibited greater adsorption and selectivity due to the presence of amino groups reduces pb ii level to less than 10 μg l and can be regenerated for further use in one more investigation fan et al 150 developed a low cost pb ii selective membrane screen printed solid state ion selective membrane s ism and used it to develop an energy efficient s ism pb ii sensor for the detection of pb ii ions in wastewater the developed s ism pb ii sensor can detect at the lowest concentration of 2 ppb ii part per billion of pb ii in wastewater and has high durability attia et al 151 investigated the pb ii removal by air gap membrane distillation using super magnetic alumina al2o3 functionalized polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf composites membrane the functionalized membrane successfully remove pb ii with a rejection efficiency of 99 36 and an increase in the permeate flux of 5 9 as compared to pvdf 4 7 adsorption the adsorption method has been widely investigated for the removal of dye pesticide other organic contaminants nutrients nitrogen phosphorus and heavy metals including pb ii and has taken a great scientific interest these years many types of adsorbent low cost available material such as agro waste biomass municipal waste sludge waste clay soil and zeolite and many of the processed and functionalized materials such as biochar hydrochar activated zeolite activated carbon and nanomaterials have been extensively studied for the treatment of industrial wastewater fig 5 table 2 84 89 154 155 163 165 176 177 in the adsorption process pollutants get adsorbed on the surface of the adsorbent via physical forces such as van der waals force or chemical bonds such as hydrogen bond ionic bond and coordinate bond etc fig 6 however the adsorption can be affected by the change in the ph time temperature metal concentration agitation rate some of the adsorbent properties e g surface area surface charge and functional groups also significantly affect the pollutant removal efficiency 82 154 163 165 177 the adsorption process seems cleaner way but the synthesis and development of adsorbent may not sound environmentally friendly several types of adsorbents require a huge amount of chemicals that may harmful to the environment another problem is that after the adsorption of pollutants on adsorbent what will be the next step researchers have chosen the way of recycling again it requires desorbents like hard acid and base and their disposal has environmental concerns however after a few cycles adsorbents lose their properties become neutral can t be utilized again and necessitate their disposal which ultimately yet again has environmental concern although adsorbent has many advantages such as require less amount of time easy to handle no need for energy and skilled manpower input ecofriendly than physicochemical methods and economical so can be considered from a treatment perspective some of the widely used adsorbents for the removal of pb ii have been discussed below 4 7 1 biomass the use of plant biomass as adsorbent has an economical perspective and easily can be applied for removal of pb ii where agro waste serve as a major source for obtaining plant biomass in huge amount for the study as well as industrial scale use and has been extensively studied other than plant biomass fungal bacterial and algal biomass also offer an economical way for its use and has been investigated for the elimination of pb ii table 2 154 155 176 178 180 because raw biomass has less adsorption efficiency for the removal of pb ii that s why several studies have applied different types of chemical and physical methods for activation biomass for improving the surface area surface charge and functional groups of biomass to enhance their pollutants adsorption efficiency but it may cause some environmental concern 152 181 182 in a study boeykens et al 154 used h3po4 83 solution for the activation of avocado seed biomass and investigated for pb ii adsorption efficiency and the removal efficiency was 80 several studies have also reported that the application of biomass in composite form with other biomass

cheaper carbon rich feed stock sources like tire palm shell waste powder agro waste municipal waste etc were investigated in the studies and demonstrated outstanding removal efficiency for pb ii table 2 199 203 however chemical activation can increase the cost of activated carbon may have some environmental but also enhance the adsorption capacity of the material 199 203 shahrokhi shahraki et al 202 made a comparative investigation on tire derived activated carbon tac and commercial activated carbon cac tac was prepared by carbonization and chemical activation of pulverized tire waste tac

2 96 99 193 194 205 210 as they are adsorbent and passes some environmental concerns like the adsorbents another aspect is their fabrication which needs a sophisticated environment and requires chemical reagents that make them expensive further if they were disposed into the environment it may also have some ecological aspect because their size is so small can inter inside the living organism and may either get accumulated inside the body or alter the metabolic processes and causes some severe negative consequences 193 194 211 213 out of the nanomaterials nanoparticles are the most proficient candidate that are widely used for different purposes such as activation of materials that make them highly active systems by improving their working efficiency various types of

adsorption efficiency for pb ii and reduces its concentration below 10 μg l in water and possess easy magnetic removal and high recyclability although chemical synthesis processes provide highly active and efficient nanomaterials but may generate hazardous secondary pollutants and are economically unachievable for all to reduce their cost in the water treatment systems and make them more ecofriendly several researchers have opted green pathways for synthesizing nanoparticles 218 221 out of all the green approaches nanoparticle synthesis using plant extracts has gained the curiosity of the workers where polyphenol flavonoid and enzymes etc play a role as capping and reducing agents in nanoparticles synthesis 218 219 221 in an investigation iron nanoparticle was synthesized using tea

performance sensitivity to various environmental stressors such as toxic pollutant loadings 4 9 1 bacteria microbial treatment allowed the use of bacteria fungi and microalgae for their utilization in the treatment of heavy metals both the types of bacteria gram positive and gram negative have been used for the management of pb ii impure water and wastewater via surface sorption and accumulation method bacterial use in the treatment system makes the system more environmentally friendly and reduced treatment time when compared with phyto treatment techniques but it necessitates carbon sources

and future perspectives pb ii is the most toxic element amid heavy metals and has grave human health and environmental concerns it causes multiple types of disorders in humans in addition to plants due to its terrible toxic efficacy and can disrupt ecosystem functioning too after contamination thus its mitigation in generating industrial effluent is very important the major cause of pb ii contamination to natural water bodies in this paper all the possible recent advanced and cleaner ways have been reviewed and discussed by accomplishing recent literature the electroactive processes such as electrocoagulation electrodialysis etc showed high efficiency in the evacuation of pb ii from contaminated water from the adsorptive treatment perspective the adsorbent such as activated

ii several nanomaterials such as nanowires nanofibers and nanosheets with the integration of electroactive processes exhibited high detection competence for pb ii in wastewater and other samples the membrane filtration and fabrication of newer membranes with terrific pb ii separation effectiveness will forever be the most suitable technique that needs more efforts to make them advanced and more exploitable in pb ii removal photocatalyzed techniques and electroactive processes can be a more useful one over removal recovery of pb ii from contaminated water but need more advancement by integrating newer fabricated material as catalyst or electrode by considering its production sustainability and cost efficacy and also require more exploration at the pilot or large scale in addition to these biological treatment of pb ii containing wastewater is the way considered as cheapest safe and sustainable way and has enormous potential for its exploitation for in situ as well as ex situ wastewater treatment all these methods have their own pros and cons so their exploitation always varies with treatment efficiency and time feasibility space durability and sustainability of the method however as above discussed that integration combination of treatment techniques with each other can give a remarkable improvement in wastewater treatment efficiency and may become the most potential methods in the near future the well known integrated strategy is constructed wetland and microbial fuel desalination cell integration of adsorbents such as nanomaterial activated biochar and other substrates with microbes and plants in cw has been proven to be the well effective advanced and sustainable way of removing pollutants similarly different types of nanomaterial originated electrode implemented mfc and mdc have exhibited excellent performance in removal and detection of pb ii in wastewater and needed more innovation and expansion over its use at the large scale for efficient and economical ways declaration of competing interest none acknowledgement the author v kumar thankful to university grants commission ugc new delhi india for providing ugc non net fellowship during his

can inadequately manipulate the intact ecosystem due to its terrible toxicity after getting contaminated with pb ii researchers have explored several ways to combat to pb ii contamination problem the entire techniques explored at present are not suitable in the aspects of sustainability and eco friendliness and thus cleaner strategies are going to be dominated over other techniques in shortly noon this aspect is lacking in the literature and hence covered in this review to ease the difficulties of the industrialists environmentalists and policymakers in finding such cleaner and ecofriendly techniques thus we primarily intended to emphasize the cleaner and advanced techniques for treatment of pb ii containing industrial wastewater therefore cleaner and advanced techniques including

toxicity to human health and plants are also elucidated in this paper for a healthier understanding of pb ii contagion annoyance graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords lead toxicity adsorption biological treatment gel technique integrated treatment method membrane filtration 1 introduction industrial and developmental activities raise the overexploitation of natural recourses and produce various types of organic and inorganic pollutants into the environment through generated effluents generally produced effluents are highly polluted with heavy metal other inorganic and organic contaminants and dumped into the aquatic bodies through small water channels which disturb the whole aquatic ecosystem inadequately this can also contaminate the groundwater via percolation with the groundwater recharge process heavy metal water contamination is become a serious issue at present due to human health and environmental concerns amid heavy metals pb ii is one of the most imperative and employed in different industries including electroplating paint steel battery smelting inorganic fertilizers and pesticides 1 2 pb ii has high toxic mutagenic and carcinogenic potential and causes several types of metabolic and physiological disorders in humans animals and plants due to its dreadful negative consequences the world health organization who and the bureau of indian standard bis is 3025 have set the permissible limit 0 01 mg l 3 310 in the substance priority list spl it has been priorities as 2nd substance by the agency for toxic substances and disease registry atsdr united states environmental protection agency us epa 4 international agency for research on cancer iarc who has recognized lead inorganic compound as group 2a carcinogen probably carcinogenic to humans 5 while 14th report on carcinogens of national toxicological program ntp u s department of health and human services us dhhs 6 has categorized lead and lead compound as reasonably anticipated to be human carcinogens natural sources such as lead containing rock weathering and volcanic eruptions are also the sources of lead contamination of the environment air water and soil in addition to anthropogenic sources industrial processes developmental activities and agricultural practices the major sources of water contamination are the industrial process such as paint electroplating battery smelting mining etc which generate a huge amount of pb ii polluted wastewater and disposed of in the land field and water bodies after contamination pb ii can manipulate the land and water ecosystem inadequately due to its extremely toxic and carcinogenic behavior pb ii and its compound have serious human health concerns in addition to ecosystem disturbance by affecting the flora and fauna of the ecosystem thus pb ii contamination is a serious issue and its removal from industrial wastewater is a challenge for industrialists environmentalists as well as health and environment concerned governmental organizations and policymakers there are plentiful efforts have been made by the researcher in diverse ways to eliminate pb ii from contaminated industrial wastewater here the most recent cleaner and advanced technologies have been focused on and reviewed from the industrial wastewater treatment perspective the effect of pb ii on human health and plants as well as its sources and chemistry is also well discussed in this paper 2 chemical characteristics of lead and its sources in water lead is tedious silvery grey metal squashy simply worked into sheets and is the 38th richest element in the earth s crust 7 lead is symbolized with pb from latin plumbum its atomic number is 82 relative atomic mass 207 2 and belongs to the p block in the periodic table its electronic configuration is xe 4f14 5d10 6s2 6p2 lead in its compound is commonly occurred with the oxidation state of 2 and 4 its high density 11 3 g cm 3 results from its close packed face centered cubic structure and high atomic mass 8 due to its low melting point 327 462 c ductility high density and relative inertness to oxidation state it is exploited for different purposes it is used in the manufacturing of lead acid battery and due to corrosion resistant it is applied in pipes paint and pigments and pewter it is also employed in fusible alloys ionizing radiation shielding lead crystal glasses which contain 12 28 lead oxide solder for electronic use and in leaded gasoline as an anti knowing additive 9 lead has also been used in pesticides hair dyes and other cosmetics ammunition glaze for pottery and lead pots used for storage of corrosive liquids however some of these uses have been banned in several countries manufacturing of these products at a large level in the industries generates a huge amount of highly lead polluted wastewater fig 1 10 in wastewater stream it normally occurs in its 2 oxidation state pb ii however wastewater generated from battery manufacturing paint pigment manufacturing and electroplating industries its concentration varied from 1 to 50 mg l 1 25 mg l and 8 10 mg l respectively 11 13 lead is mostly extracted from galena pbs lead sulfide by the roasting process which also generates plenty amount of pb ii contaminated wastewater 14 lead and lead oxides react with acid excluding phosphoric and sulfuric acid and base and it is inclined to form a covalent bond pb ii ions are typically colorless in water and partly hydrolyze in pb oh and finally form pb4 oh 4 4 where hydroxyl ions work as bridging ligands 15 16 its sulfate salt is insoluble in water while lead nitrate pb no3 2 and lead acetate pb ch3coo 2 are highly soluble in water and purposively used for the synthesis of other lead s compounds its most frequently known inorganic tetravalent oxidation state carrying compound is lead tetraoxide red lead pb3o4 which of one lead atom has a 4 oxidation state and two of them have 2 oxidation states 17 however in the organic metallic compound lead mostly occur in its 4 oxidation state and well known forms of organolead are tetramethyl lead pb ch3 4 and tetraethyllead pb c2h5 4 which are easily decomposed when come under the sunlight and ultraviolet rays 18 in the areas where soft or acidic water occurs that can cause lead contamination via dissolution of lead in acidic water if supplied through the lead pipe while hard water forms an insoluble layer on the pipe similarly oxygenated water may also result in pb ii contamination by dissolving as lead oxide 19 the presence of pb ii can be easily detected by its precipitation with dilute hydrochloric acid hcl solution as lead chloride pb cl 2 precipitate scarcely soluble in water and its dilute solution with bubbling of hydrogen sulfide h2s form lead sulfide pbs precipitate 20 3 toxicity of lead lead is one of the most toxic elements when comes inside the body via inhalation and ingestion with sources such as food and lead dust etc absorbed and accumulates in blood bones liver kidney brain and skin fig 2 it has no known biological function although its organolead compounds such as tetraethyl lead are absorbed in the digestive system and get distributed to the whole body within hours and vitamin c facilitates its absorption in the digestive tract 21 22 lead induced reactive oxygen species ros production inside the cell is one of its major toxicity mechanisms ros include hydroxyl radical oh superoxide ion o2 nascent oxygen atom o etc that results in oxidative stress and can oxidize membrane lipid protein dna and other macromolecules and disrupt the cell functioning normally lead affects the metabolic processes by inhibiting the enzymatic function via replacing the cationic species from enzymes and can disturb the whole metabolic functioning in the blood it can inhibit the heme synthesis can interfere with the red blood corpuscles rbcs and erythrocytes membrane by oxidative damages make it more fragile them and cause hemolysis and ultimately anemia 23 26 pb ii can induce multiple types of gene expression in human cells such as protein kinase activity metallothionein expression and the expression of cellular metabolic enzymes and have also seen its impact on several neuron signaling pathways 27 in adults the peripheral nervous system pns and in the child the central nervous system cns is most sensitive to lead induced toxicity 311 313 brain of childs under the age of six years is more susceptible to lead toxicity due to rapid growth and development of the brain at this age low level 5 μg dl of lead can reduce the intellectual and academic performance hyperactivity attention disorder and low birth weight in children while increase blood lead level up to 100 μg dl causes obvious symptoms such as protracted vomiting and encephalopathy and even death 28 lead induced oxidative stress can kill neurons by exciting the forkhead box class o transcription factor foxo3 an essential component in the cell life death pathway 29 30 generally 80 85 of total absorbed lead gets deposited in bones works as a reservoir for lead 31 and can disturb the bone formation and development process as reported in model organisms 32 lead has potential immune toxicity via generating ros in neutrophils and can expression of interferon gamma inducible gtpases p47 irg and p65 gbp essential for intracellular pathogen killing 33 increased blood lead level bll can also affect the renal system liver and gastrointestinal tract by impairing the enzymatic structure and functions 314 in males increased bll may affect male fertility by affecting motility morphology and other functional parameters of sperm and decreasing sperm count while the increased seminal lead level can cause dna fragmentation 34 35 elevated bll in females may result in a high risk of miscarriage premature rupture of membrane etc 36 37 lead toxicity causes severe impacts on plants can affect the nutrient uptake alter the plant water relation and generate ros inside cells that results in the reduction in photosynthesis activity growth and development process and also affect the productivity of crops 38 40 lead contamination hinders the germination and growth of seedlings by affecting many types of enzymes activity such as α amylase β amylase protease acid phosphatase and acid invertase which are associated with carbohydrates and protein metabolism 41 42 it can also damage the mitochondrial structure in root meristematic cells and break biological membrane cause loss of cristae dictyosomes and endoplasmic reticulum with 2 3 days of exposure 43 its toxic effects also have been reported on transpiration chlorophyll synthesis cell division and shoot and root development 44 45 lead induced generated ros damage the protein lipid and nucleotides and cause oxidative damages in response to elevated ros several types of enzymatic and non enzymatic antioxidants are produced in plant cells to reduce the oxidative stress which includes proline glutathione catalase peroxidase superoxide dismutase glutathione oxidase and reductase ascorbic acid glutathione s transferase which alleviate the lead toxicity but excess concentration cause multiple types of alteration in plants morphology physiology and biochemical processes 2 46 48 lead toxicity can hamper the carotenoids plastoquinone and electron transport chain etc impair the enzyme function and affect the co2 fixation 49 it also increases the synthesis and activity of chlorophyllase cause chlorophyll breakdown into mg phytol and porphyrin rings 50 moreover reduction in the activity of ferredoxin nadp reductase and delta aminolevulinic acid dehydratase alad under the presence of pb ii can inhibit the chlorophyll synthesis process 51 in c3 plants pb ii exposure disturbs the ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase activity that reduces the co2 assimilation in c3 cycle 52 its exposure increase respiration rate and increases the adenosine triphosphate atp production which confirmed the high energy demand to conquer the toxic effect of pb ii 53 54 4 cleaner treatment techniques heavy metal pollution has become a serious environmental concern at present conventionally the heavy metal contaminated water and wastewater including pb ii is treated by various physicochemical treatment techniques these techniques include chemical precipitation coagulation flocculation adsorption and filtration chemical based treatment techniques are the most employed techniques and are being used for the removal of pb ii and other heavy metals pollutants from wastewater 55 56 these chemical based processes have several disadvantages since they require a huge amount of reagents energy inputs need for skilled operators disposal of toxic waste sludge produced during the process the generated sludge wastes have a huge impact on the environment due to potential ecological risks the environmental concern of these treatment options raises the demand for cleaner treatment processes that are environmentally friendly and sustainable 55 60 several treatment techniques have been investigated in various studies that have the potential to treat pb ii contaminated industrial wastewater in cleaner ways these cleaner techniques can reduce the environmental problems that are associated with chemical based treatment techniques these techniques may produce less amount of sludge require less quantity of chemical generate less toxic waste and do not necessitate high input of energy and skilled manpower as compared to chemical based treatment options these cleaner techniques include membrane filtration adsorption electrochemical hydrogel photocatalysis biological and bio integrated treatment techniques which have been critically discussed in this section 4 1 electrocoagulation electrocoagulation ec process is widely adopted as a cleaner strategy that can eliminate toxic metals suspended solids organic contaminants and microorganisms from wastewater ec combines the coagulation flotation and electrochemistry and expels the particle from the wastewater by weakening the power and remaining the particle suspended in wastewater fig 4a table 1 72 74 300 in the ec process coagulating ions are produced on the sacrificial electrode which destabilizes the dissolved suspended and emulsified contaminants from an aqueous medium by neutralizing the charge and aggregate to form flocs 72 73 75 the high electricity consumption of the ec process has limited its use due to high operational costs 75 in an investigation the ec process was employed for removing metal ions including pb ii using an iron electrode the functional parameters such as ph internal electrode distance current density charging time and solution temperature were considered for the study and under the optimized conditions pb ii removal reached 98 5 315 in the removal of pb ii basically two types of electrodes have been studied iron electrode and aluminium electrode both of the electrodes have been reported to have huge potential for pb ii removal from wastewater 66 67 for instance kamaraj et al 66 67 studied the removal performance of the ec process for pb ii in the ec process galvanized iron and magnesium were used as cathode and anode respectively and achieved maximum removal of 99 3 at ph 7 0 with a current density of 0 8 a dm2 with an energy utilization of 0 72 kwh m3 the autocatalytic behavior of the ec reactor is also found as an effective process in removing pb ii aljaberi 316 constructed triple aluminium tubes in a concentric manner putting the cathode in the middle of the anode electrode they stated that ec reactor was worked as an autocatalytic reactor and improved the kinetic and adsorption process and successfully pb ii removal was recorded the electrocoagulation electroflotaion integrated process has also been reported for the treatment of different types of contaminant polluted wastewater including pb ii 74 besides aluminium electrodes other electrodes like zinc electrodes are also being used in the ec process and proficient results have been recorded 10 69 another progress that has been achieved in previous studies is the use of renewable electricity sources solar energy is one of the renewable energy resources enabling cleaner techniques than other conventional techniques 69 76 in a study the electrocoagulation process powered by a solar photovoltaic system was used for pb ii removal from contaminated water to reduce the cost and improve the system efficiency 10 in the system perforated zinc was utilized as a novel anode electrode for the analysis electrode materials electrode geometry and energy consumption were considered at a current density of 1 13 ma cm2 the removal rate of pb ii was 99 9 within 10 min 10 hussin et al 69 combined the solar electrocoagulation with the adsorption process for pb ii removal where perforated zinc was used as an electrode in the system ec process occurred on the upper part of the system while adsorption reaction at bottom of the reactor and pb ii was successfully removed from the water zinc electrode involved following electrochemical

for the treatment of wastewater generally for desalination of metal polluted water 77 in the process a voltage applied between the electrodes cathode and anode passing through ion exchange membrane iem is used in electrodialysis ed cell to remove the charged pollutants from neutral aqueous solution fig 4b 77 299 this process is especially more impressive for the separation of selective ions using specific types of iems sajjad et al 2020 but again the electricity consumption limits its use these days various improvements have been done in the ec process to advance the process efficiency and most of them are centered on iems modification nemati et al 78 prepared a novel heterogeneous ion exchange membrane for the exclusion of pb2 and some other metal ions was highly effective for the separation of pb ii and other cations and the separation efficiency was 99 9 for pb2 ions from the solution chemical modification of iems work and can improve system efficiency hosseini et al 79 fabricated mixed matrix electrodialysis heterogeneous iem using polyaniline pani co graphene oxide go functionalized composite nanoplates by polymerization of aniline with the presence of graphene oxide having high surface hydrophilicity ion exchange capacity and water content transport number membrane potential and selectivity this modification enhanced the pb ii flux by 50 as compared to pristine one it is also being reported in the studies that combining the ed process with other techniques can give excellent performance hamane et al 80 combined the adsorption with photo electrodialysis for removal of pb reduced the pb ii to threshold limit via a combination of this process in the process algerian bentonite was used as an adsorbent and achieved 90 removal and 30 and 80 of the remaining pb ii was dropped to threshold by the photo electrodialysis system under artificial light and sunlight respectively 4 3 electrodeposition electrodeposition is a striking technique broadly applied for the removal recovery of metal from water and wastewater this technique is also used for plating and decorating objects for different purposes in the electrodeposition process the material applied for depositing the metal controlled its efficiency influence the dendrites formation side reaction incidence evolution of h2 and process stability 81 83 in a study two hydrotalcite

removal happened via two parallel mechanisms adsorption and electrodeposition 81 recently zhang et al 84 89 developed bioelectrochemically assisted electrodeposition bes edp system for the removal of pb ii from smelting wastewater the system was consisted of two chambers and partitioned with an anionic exchange membrane carbon brush and graphite were used as anode and cathode that were connected with an external circuit the anodic chamber was inoculated with the sludge from the wastewater treatment plant in the results they found that at a cathodic potential of 0 75 v vs ag agcl the removal of pb ii was 98 within 10 h of reaction time it was also found that metal oxides were also formed during pb ii reduction that affects the electrodeposition process 4 4 electrochemical technique

electrochemical system in an investigation a porous electroactive composite based film made of core shell nanospheres as high crystalline protonated zeolite socony mobil 5 hzsm 5 polyaniline polystyrene hzsm 5 pani pss composite was fabricated the fabricated hzsm 5 pani pss composite film was investigated for the removal of pb2 and showed quick electrochemical uptake and release ability from water due to strong diving force generated from applied electric field 93 vajedi and dehghani 94 examined the titanium dioxide reduced graphene oxide tio2 rgo nanocomposites customized glassy carbon electrode for removal of pb2 and other metal ions from aqueous solution it was found that tio2 rgo 1 1 modified electrode was highly effective for removal of pb2 and other cations as compared to tio2 electrode due to containing both the types of features tio2 and go these days electrochemical based sensor technology is being investigated for sensing pb2 in water and wastewater in the system newly synthesized materials modified electrodes like nanoparticle nanosheet and nanocomposites have been utilized and exhibited excellent sensitivity towards pb ii 95 for instant xu et al 96 99 modified the glassy carbon electrode gce with polypyrrole nanoparticles and polydopamine in the presence of dispersants quaternary ammonium group and lignosulfonate the modified gce showed high sensitivity and selectivity to pb2 in the concentration range from 0 1 to 50 μm and the redox potential was around 0 55 v for pb2 similarly jin et al 100 101 synthesized sns decorated bi2o3 nanosheets heterostructure by a superficial hydro solvothermal approach the synthesized sns bi2o3 nanocomposites exhibit remarkable qualities such as mesoporous channels high surface area and speedy electron transferability for electrochemical reactions in the pb ii detection experiment sns bi2o3 showed improved pb ii detection ability with low lods of 1 40 nm and was effectively utilized for detection of pb ii in tap and lake water some other studies were also investigated sensing performance of electrochemical process using newly synthesized materials modified electrodes such as cezr oxide nanospheres modified glassy carbon electrode cezr oxide gce 95 multilayer bi mofs reduced graphene oxide films modified electrode 102 and porous flower like nio rgo nanocomposite modified glassy carbon electrode sun et al 2020 however the presence of other pollutants in water like hg ii and cu ii can affect the performance and sensing ability of sensors 96 99 4 5 photocatalytic process the photocatalytic process uses light as an energy source for the degradation of the pollutant with the help of photocatalysts semiconductors tio2 and zno are the widely used photocatalyst investigated in many studies for the removal and degradation of pollutants 103 104 this technique is one of the most sustainable and environmentally friendly techniques based on its operation stage though has some environmental concerns at photocatalyst fabrication stages some researchers have tried to remove such complexity by using the green approach 105 106 while this approach is lacking in the case of pb ii removal in a study you et al 107 fabricated bi2o3 tio2 composite by a facile hydrothermal method the prepared bi2o3 tio2 composite was investigated for simultaneous photocatalytic degradation of dibutyl phthalate dbp and removal of pb ii it was found that photoinduced electrons as well as holes separately moved to different ways that cause high availability of photocatalytic reaction locations for reduction of pb ii and dbp degradation fig 3b the fermi levels matching at the n p heterojunction for energy level matching resulted in pb ii reduction into pb 0 on to the bi2o3 tio2 composite in both types of aqueous solution pb ii and pb ii dbp under visible light and the proposed mechanism for pb ii reduction was as eqs 4 11 in another investigation la2o3 modified ceo2 particle

in a study conducted by hosseini and mohebbi 109 the photocatalyzed reduction process of pb2 ions attained 98 removal in 60 min of time duration they stated that modifier hastened the electron transfer from tio2 to pb2 by imidazole bridge with irradiation of uv light and the photoreduction happened sequentially via chemisorptions reduction and desorption process on modified tio2 surface studies also have focused to make photo based systems as a sensor for the detection of pollutants in water and wastewater in a study deshpande et al 110 designed and synthesized a spiropyran based receptor connecting oxygen donor ligands mbsp mbsp was selective for pb2 and by complex formation makes colour change which noticeable by naked eyes which reversible to visible light irradiation this spiropyran based receptor acts as a photo reversible switch for pb2 ions and can detect the least concentration of 4 10 8 m 4 6 membrane filtration membrane filtration is one of the widely used techniques widely used for the removal of different types of contaminants such as organic heavy metal pesticide and microorganisms from drinking water as well as wastewater there are different types of porous and thin film composite membranes that have been used in wastewater treatment these membranes are microfiltration mf ultrafiltration uf nanofiltration nf reverse osmosis ro forward osmosis fo while the principal factors on its selection for treatment of polluted wastewater are size distribution of pore the charge of surface solution flow degree of hydrophilicity and the existence of functional groups that help in the separation of pollutant 111 114 these features can affect the separation efficiency and water production rate of the membrane however in the removal of pb ii uf nf ro fo and adsorptive membrane have been widely studied fig 4c 96 99 115 119 4 6 1 ultrafiltration ultrafiltration membrane has high efficiency in removal of different types of pollutants from wastewater and is considered as a low pressure driven membrane however the size of pb ii cation is slighter than the ultrafiltration membrane pore size pb ii cations easily permeate to uf membrane and it becomes disqualified for pb ii removal 120 122 however chemical modification or blending of parent material with effective material such as nanoparticles graphene oxide organic polymer etc have advanced the uf membrane and turn into an appropriate useful membrane for pb ii exclusion from water 96 99 123 125 such type of modification improves the membrane properties like hydrophilicity porosity pure water flux permeability and rejection ability of the membrane 121 125 for instance xu et al 96 99 synthesized a covalent organic framework cof modified pvdf ultrafiltration membrane and

complexation or chemical binding in addition to size exclusion 121 125 126 4 6 2 nanofiltration nanofiltration nf membrane has commendable performance in the separation of heavy metal contaminants including pb ii and has been extensively studied for the treatment of metal contaminated wastewater 116 127 128 membrane modification or fictionalization with specific substances is the foremost modernism in case nf membrane and many types of substances are being used at present these substances includes amino acid polymer organosilica nanoparticle nanofibers etc and an excellent improvement in pb ii removal has been reported using these membranes 118 128 131 in a recent investigation a newly synthesized periodic mesoporous organosilica pmo functionalized with p phenylenediamine ppd

public over these years and broadly used for removing total dissolved solids tds heavy metal and other contaminants from drinking water its high pressure driven system uses a semi permeable membrane for the reverse osmosis process to produce fresh water 115 140 142 the combination of reverse osmosis membrane with other membrane processes also has been found as an efficient tool for the treatment recovery of pb ii and other pollutants containing industrial wastewater for example the microfiltration reverse osmosis membrane process was applied for the recovery of water from organized industrial wastewater using reverse osmosis membrane hp bw30 and le at the lab and pilot scale levels the system showed high removal efficiency from wastewater for pb ii 89 3 100 and other pollutants with different ro membranes with a recovery efficiency of 80 however permeate flux was significantly reduced for all the reverse osmosis membranes 140 similarly petrinic et al 317 investigated the ultrafiltration reverse osmosis based uf ro process for the recovery of wastewater from metal finishing industries uf ro system successfully removed different types of pollutants including pb ii from industrial wastewater with efficient recovery of water for reuse purposes since using ro in water and wastewater purification has high efficiency while its primary implementation and maintenance cost and high pressure driven features limit its use and make it unfortunate for large scale applications 4 6 5 adsorptive membrane adsorptive membranes possess dual function features as filtration and adsorption in the removal of pollutants from water and wastewater sometimes it is also known as mixed matrix membrane mmms based on their development fabrication 119 these are derived by blending the

investigated for the removal of dye pesticide other organic contaminants nutrients nitrogen phosphorus and heavy metals including pb ii and has taken a great scientific interest these years many types of adsorbent low cost available material such as agro waste biomass municipal waste sludge waste clay soil and zeolite and many of the processed and functionalized materials such as biochar hydrochar activated zeolite activated carbon and nanomaterials have been extensively studied for the treatment of industrial wastewater fig 5 table 2 84 89 154 155 163 165 176 177 in the adsorption process pollutants get adsorbed on the surface of the adsorbent via physical forces such as van der waals force or chemical bonds such as hydrogen bond ionic bond and coordinate bond etc fig 6 however the adsorption can be affected by the change in the ph time temperature metal concentration agitation rate some of the adsorbent properties e g surface area surface charge and functional groups also significantly affect the pollutant removal efficiency 82 154 163 165 177 the adsorption process seems cleaner way but the synthesis and development of adsorbent may not sound environmentally friendly several types of adsorbents require a huge amount of chemicals that may harmful to the environment another problem is that after the adsorption of pollutants on adsorbent what will be the next step researchers have chosen the way of recycling again it requires desorbents like hard acid and base and their disposal has environmental concerns however after a few cycles adsorbents lose their properties become neutral can t be utilized again and necessitate their disposal which ultimately yet again has environmental concern although adsorbent has many advantages such as require less amount of time easy to handle no need for energy and skilled manpower input ecofriendly than physicochemical methods and economical so can be considered from a treatment perspective some of the widely used adsorbents for the removal of pb ii have been discussed below 4 7 1 biomass the use of plant biomass as adsorbent has an economical perspective and easily can be applied for removal of pb ii where

and algal biomass also offer an economical way for its use and has been investigated for the elimination of pb ii table 2 154 155 176 178 180 because raw biomass has less adsorption efficiency for the removal of pb ii that s why several studies have applied different types of chemical and physical methods for activation biomass for improving the surface area surface charge and functional groups of biomass to enhance their pollutants adsorption efficiency but it may cause some environmental concern 152 181 182 in a study boeykens et al 154 used h3po4 83 solution for the activation of avocado seed biomass and investigated for pb ii adsorption efficiency and the removal efficiency was 80 several studies have also reported that the application of biomass in composite form with other biomass

cheaper carbon rich feed stock sources like tire palm shell waste powder agro waste municipal waste etc were investigated in the studies and demonstrated outstanding removal efficiency for pb ii table 2 199 203 however chemical activation can increase the cost of activated carbon may have some environmental but also enhance the adsorption capacity of the material 199 203 shahrokhi shahraki et al

2 96 99 193 194 205 210 as they are adsorbent and passes some environmental concerns like the adsorbents another aspect is their fabrication which needs a sophisticated environment and requires chemical reagents that make them expensive further if they were disposed into the environment it may also have some ecological aspect because their size is so small can inter inside the living organism and may either get accumulated inside the body or alter the metabolic processes and causes some severe negative consequences 193 194 211 213 out of the nanomaterials nanoparticles are the most proficient candidate that are widely used for different purposes such as activation of materials that make them highly active systems by improving their working efficiency various types of

active and efficient nanomaterials but may generate hazardous secondary pollutants and are economically unachievable for all to reduce their cost in the water treatment systems and make them more ecofriendly several researchers have opted green pathways for synthesizing nanoparticles 218 221 out of all the green approaches nanoparticle synthesis using plant extracts has gained the curiosity of the workers where polyphenol flavonoid and enzymes etc play a role as capping and reducing agents in nanoparticles synthesis 218 219 221 in an investigation iron nanoparticle was synthesized using tea

suitable drying technology these days advanced synthesis processes have been developed to prepare several types of aerogels such as inorganic organic carbon graphene carbon nanotube and natural based aerogels aerogels have also been investigated for the removal of pb ii from contaminated water via adsorption the high surface area and porosity of aerogels have been considered as the most imperative features of aerogels affecting the adsorption capacity of pb ii and other pollutants studies have reported a very high adsorption efficiency for pb ii from water and wastewater for example li et al 129 130 utilized a directional freeze drying approach to synthesize cs nfc chitosan nanofibrillated cellulose aerogels with microchannel structure and used for the adsorption of pb ii the cs nfc shows

performances of microorganisms under on site bioremediation are nutritional status of the sites moisture content temperature microbial community of the sites presence of other pollutants and their concentration and pollutant chemical properties as bioremediation is the use of living organisms in the treatment of water but biosorption is another strategy of the use of dead and dried plants and microbial biomass in the wastewater treatment biosorption is the surface functional group dependent process that plays an active role in the removal of pb ii or other pollutants from wastewater table 3 11 96 99 257 258 264 266 301 302 removal of heavy metal in the broad range of ph and temperature utilization of economical growth substrate and low operational cost are some of the advantages while the requirement of a high duration of time is the disadvantage of bioremediation bioremediation is a slow process which may generate high amounts of sludge wastes and require proper monitoring to achieve maintain optimized treatment performances of the bioremediation system other major drawbacks of bioremediation include high capital e g large system area required and operational problems e g performance sensitivity to various environmental stressors such as toxic pollutant loadings 4 9 1 bacteria microbial treatment allowed the use of bacteria fungi and microalgae for their utilization in the treatment of heavy metals both the types of bacteria gram positive and gram negative have been used for the management of pb ii impure water and wastewater via surface sorption and accumulation method bacterial use in the treatment system makes the system more environmentally friendly and reduced treatment time when compared with phyto treatment techniques but it necessitates carbon sources

and comprehensively utilized for the removal of nutrients dyes pesticides pharmaceuticals and heavy metals from wastewater cws combine the adsorption and bioremediation mechanisms in the removal of pollutants and become a well suitable and sustainable method for treating wastewater in an economical way 250 252 these days various cws configurations are reported in the literature such as vertical flow horizontal flow sub surface flow up flow planted cws etc mohammed and babatunde 294 set up a vertical flow constructed wetland vfcw using a perspex column and filled with rounded gravel and air dried ferric dewatered sludge contain 193 85 mg g of fe vfcw top layer was planted with phragmites australis the affecting parameters such as wastewater volume contact time temperature flow rate heavy

hyphae and photoelectron generated from synthetic anatase electrode enhance the pb ii products formation it s surface sorption on hyphae and accumulation inside the hyphae cell of a niger 5 conclusion and future perspectives pb ii is the most toxic element amid heavy metals and has grave human health and environmental concerns it causes multiple types of disorders in humans in addition to plants due to its terrible toxic efficacy and can disrupt ecosystem functioning too after contamination thus its mitigation in generating industrial effluent is very important the major cause of pb ii contamination to natural water bodies in this paper all the possible recent advanced and cleaner ways have been reviewed and discussed by accomplishing recent literature the electroactive processes such as electrocoagulation electrodialysis etc showed high efficiency in the evacuation of pb ii from contaminated water from the adsorptive treatment perspective the adsorbent such as activated biochar zeolite activated carbon and advanced nanomaterials which are blasted as nanoparticle nanocomposite nanofibers nanosheets nanotubes nanowire etc exhibited awful adsorption performance for pb ii several nanomaterials such as nanowires nanofibers and nanosheets with the integration of electroactive processes exhibited high detection competence for pb ii in wastewater and other samples the membrane filtration and fabrication of newer membranes with terrific pb ii separation effectiveness will forever be the most suitable technique that needs more efforts to make them advanced and more exploitable in pb ii removal photocatalyzed techniques and electroactive processes can be a more useful one over removal recovery of pb ii from contaminated water but need more advancement by integrating newer fabricated material as catalyst or electrode by considering its production sustainability and cost efficacy and also require more exploration at the pilot or large scale in addition to these biological treatment of pb ii containing wastewater is the way considered as cheapest safe and sustainable way and has enormous potential for its exploitation for in situ as well as ex situ wastewater treatment all these methods have their own pros and cons so their exploitation always varies with treatment efficiency and time feasibility space durability and sustainability of the method however as above discussed that integration combination of treatment techniques with each other can give a remarkable improvement in wastewater treatment efficiency and may become the most potential methods in the near future the well known integrated strategy is constructed wetland and microbial fuel desalination cell integration of adsorbents such as nanomaterial activated biochar and other substrates with microbes and plants in cw has been proven to be the well effective advanced and sustainable way of removing pollutants similarly different types of nanomaterial originated electrode implemented mfc and mdc have exhibited excellent performance in removal and detection of pb ii in wastewater and needed more innovation and expansion over its use at the large scale for efficient and economical ways declaration of competing interest none acknowledgement the author v kumar thankful to university grants commission ugc new delhi india for providing ugc non net fellowship during his
