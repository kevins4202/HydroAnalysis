9160,understanding irrigation performance by focusing on its institutional dimension can help improve water use and smallholder farmers livelihoods while many studies have evaluated the institutional performance of small scale farmer managed irrigation systems virtually no empirical studies have evaluated the performance of community based water management institutions in large scale irrigation systems with non governmental bureaucratic administration this study aims to fill this gap using a mixed methods research design combining ethnographic work and a quantitative survey of 81 smallholder farmers from four community institutions ejidos in an irrigation district in chiapas southern mexico while the management model implemented in the transfer of mexican irrigation districts to users consisted of a bureaucratic administration entirely in the hands of contract agents this study reveals the essential role of community institutions in local water management however although all four communities use water from the same irrigation district the results revealed significant differences in the institutional performance of irrigation management using the institutional analysis and development iad framework developed by elinor ostrom we showed that these differences could be explained by the biophysical attributes involved in irrigation irrigation technique access to groundwater resources location of the water intake and community characteristics social capital and group size the study recommends that water managers involve communities in the creation of farmers associations which could increase their social capital and thus the performance of local irrigation furthermore the results suggest that farmers views on the institutional performance of irrigation management should receive more attention in the large scale irrigation system with bureaucratic administration this knowledge can be particularly useful to improve the different levels of organization and thus water governance of irrigation districts in mexico keywords institution bureaucratic irrigation system collective action mixed methods research design ejido data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction in the 20th century the irrigated area grew significantly worldwide due to investments by governments development banks and other international donor funds in large scale irrigation infrastructure in most cases the management of new irrigation projects was placed in the hands of government agencies with little or no involvement of new irrigators vermillion 1997 senanayake et al 2015 however in the following decades the performance of these new irrigation systems did not meet the expected goals mollinga et al 2007 state run irrigation systems have been affected by financial difficulties related to low operation and maintenance fees and difficulties in collecting them these management problems led to the degradation of irrigation infrastructure unreliable water supply and a lack of significant improvements in agricultural productivity chambers 1980 wade and chambers 1980 uphoff et al 1986 playán et al 2018 to address these problems many governments implemented irrigation management transfer imt programs garces restrepo et al 2007 vermillion 1997 these reforms were encouraged by structural adjustment programs administered by international financial institutions such as the international monetary fund imf and the world bank in order for national governments to reduce their range of responsibilities and activities in public service delivery konadu agyemang 2000 suhardiman and giordano 2014 these institutional and economic reforms have led to the transfer of irrigation system operation and maintenance responsibilities from public services to decentralized community agencies or local organizations vermillion 1997 johnson 1997 suhardiman et al 2014 during the process of imt water user associations wuas were considered essential elements of the new management model wegerich 2010 this statement was based on the success of self management in small scale traditional or indigenous systems in which irrigators were smallholder farmers including the case studies of the bali subak the nepalese kulos the zanjera in the ilocos region in the philippines as well as the case of promoting self management in gal oya sri lanka coward 1979 uphoff 1986 hunt 1989 ostrom 1990 wijayaratna and uphoff 1997 meinzen dick 2007 some studies have thus shown that the success of self management is linked to the creation of community institutions adapted to local conditions ostrom 1990 agrawal 2001 meinzen dick 2007 these institutions determine a set of rules norms and values that make collective action possible ostrom 1990 dietz et al 2003 roggero et al 2018 organizations then intervene in an institutional context that legitimizes them and to which they must comply ostrom 1990 concerning irrigation system management these institutions are fundamental to water sharing among farmers conflict resolution and infrastructure maintenance ostrom 1990 meinzen dick 2007 bastakoti and shivakoti 2012 leroy et al 2022 compliance with rules notably through a system of control and sanction determines the institutional performance meinzen dick 2007 in recent decades empirical studies on the institutional performance of irrigation systems have flourished as they provide insights into how rules affect collective action and thus the sustainability of irrigated agriculture lam and ostrom 2010 bastakoti and shivakoti 2012 wang et al 2013 leroy et al 2022 while the institutional performance of small scale irrigation systems has been widely demonstrated it is more difficult for groups of irrigators to manage large scale 1 1 for the purposes of this study bureaucratic irrigation systems are considered large and traditional or indigenous systems small hunt 1979 irrigation systems coward 1979 hunt 1989 ostrom 1992 yoder 1994 meinzen dick 2007 some authors therefore emphasize the need for an administrative management apparatus with specialized staff constituting a bureaucracy in large scale irrigation systems while small scale irrigation systems can do without such specialized staff vaidyanathan 1999 palerm viqueira 2020 this form of management described as bureaucratic has been highlighted in argentina s mendoza province peru palerm viqueira 2010 2014 turkey svendsen and nott 2000 colombia bruns and meinzen dick 2000 and mexico hunt 1989 romero lópez and palerm viquiera 2018 palerm viqueira 2020 among others however some authors point out that community institutions play an essential role even in a bureaucratic type of management freeman et al 1989 point out the advantages of local organizations that link irrigators to the administration in charge of water management in his study of babylonian irrigation glick 1972 points out that state bureaucracy relies on local organizations and local knowledge hunt 1989 romero lópez palerm viquiera 2018 and palerm viqueira 2020 highlight the significant presence of local organizations involved in water distribution and maintenance within mexican irrigation districts while many studies have assessed the institutional performance of small scale farmer self managed irrigation systems see for example lam 1998 bardhan 2000 araral 2009 bastakoti and shivakoti 2012 leroy et al 2022 virtually no empirical studies have assessed the performance of community based water management institutions in large scale irrigation with non governmental bureaucratic administration understanding the performance of irrigation by focusing on its institutional dimension at the local level can be useful for improving water use and smallholder livelihoods within the large scale irrigation system this study aims to assess the institutional performance of community based water management in a large scale irrigation system with non governmental bureaucratic administration to this end we conducted a mixed methods study combining ethnographic work and a quantitative survey with 81 farmers from four community institutions ejidos in an irrigation district in chiapas southern mexico the questions guiding this research were 1 what is the role importance and performance of community based water management institutions in irrigation systems with bureaucratic administration 2 what factors explain the differences in irrigation management performance of community institutions 3 is there a relationship between farmers satisfaction with the services provided by the wua and their perceptions of community level irrigation management performance the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 provides an overview of mexican irrigation districts and the community institutions that are ejidos section 3 proposes an analytical framework to assess the performance of institutions within a bureaucratic irrigation system and the factors that influence this performance section 4 discusses the proposed methodology and section 5 presents empirical results section 6 summarizes and discusses the main results in section 7 the conclusion includes an overview of the policy implications of this research 2 irrigation districts and ejidos in mexico in mexico irrigation districts distritos de riego are defined as large scale irrigation systems that were developed in most cases in the second half of the 20th century as part of a public policy to promote the country s agricultural development johnson 1997 salas and wilson 2004 it differs from irrigation units unidades de riego which are small essentially independent irrigation systems that users have formally or informally managed since their inception eighty six irrigation districts and over 40 000 irrigation units are registered by the national water agency 2 2 comisión nacional del agua conagua national water agency is a decentralised administrative body of the federal ministry of the environment and natural resources in charge of the management regulation control and protection of mexican water resources conagua in mexico conagua 2016 one of the most critical reforms developed by the mexican agricultural sector in recent decades is the transfer of irrigation districts to users arreguin cortes et al 2019 this transfer began in 1988 and was spurred by the state s global downsizing policies global proposals for an irrigation district transfer policy and the economic crisis in mexico johnson 1997 salas and wilson 2004 the objectives of the imt reform were to promote more efficient operation and maintenance of irrigation districts while increasing agricultural productivity it was also intended to improve water distribution promoting equity in resource management finally the imt was also intended to free up government resources that could be reallocated to other uses in mexico salas and wilson 2004 as a result several authors have highlighted the success of the irrigation district transfer program to users in mexico particularly in the northern regions johnson 1997 salas and wilson 2004 senanayake et al 2015 while this reform consisted of transferring the hydraulic infrastructure to the farmers it was proposed that only the minor irrigation network would be ceded while conagua would retain the operation of the headworks irrigation districts were divided into modules módulos to transfer their administration to water users associations wuas johnson 1997 arreguin cortes et al 2019 unlike irrigation units that facilitate an operation carried out by the irrigators themselves the organizational design of the irrigation district modules is centralized by a board of directors chosen and appointed by the water users which hires the office staff and water distribution supervisors canaleros and handles maintenance using the machinery johnson 1997 vermillion 1997 palerm viqueira 2006 arreguin cortes et al 2019 the water is distributed to different users including private landowners indigenous communities and ejidos in this study we focus on ejidos farming communities created as part of the agrarian reform program that emerged from the mexican revolution 1910 1920 nuijten 2004 within the ejidos decision making and rule making processes regarding the use and management of common lands and water are carried out by the assembly which is the supreme body of the ejido ejidos are recognized as communities that facilitate institutional arrangements for controlling access as well as rights over resources mckean 2000 monroy sais et al 2016 this makes the ejido an excellent community institution for exploring irrigation performance 3 theoretical background institutional irrigation performance most studies on irrigation performance assessment focus on financial and physical indicators córcoles et al 2010 elshaikh et al 2018 awada et al 2019 however several studies have shown that institutional arrangements i e usage rules created by farmers are critical for high irrigation performance lam and ostrom 2010 bastakoti and shivakoti 2012 wang et al 2013 roggero et al 2018 wang and wu 2018 soliman et al 2021 leroy et al 2022 based on these studies we consider that institutional performance of collective irrigation can be achieved through compliance with rules and thus the successful implementation of activities such as maintenance of irrigation infrastructure allocation coordination equitable distribution of water payment of fees participation in meetings and conflict resolution empirical studies have demonstrated that within a single irrigation system multiple organizational levels can be highly correlated with the operational levels of the system coward 1979 pradhan 1989 1990 cox 2014 dell angelo et al 2014 2016 these multiple levels of governance are characteristic of large scale irrigation systems characterized by an administration of a bureaucratic nature palerm viqueira 2009 freeman and angin 1999 emphasize the role of intermediary organizations between the irrigator and the bureaucratic administration i e a community institution that combines technical knowledge on managing water with in depth knowledge of the local situation romero lópez palerm viquiera 2018 and palerm viqueira 2020 have shown through several mexican case studies that the best way to match the bureaucratic and local levels is through an intermediate level of organizations the two levels of governance that characterize the irrigation system studied lead to an evaluation of the institutional performance of the wua and the community institutions in this research we emphasize the farmers point of view i e their perception of irrigation management performance for example several studies have suggested that users satisfaction with the level of wua service provision is an effective method of assessing irrigation management performance gorton et al 2009 shivakoti and thapa 2005 uysal and atış 2010 other work has shown that perceived compliance with water management rules can be a reliable indicator for assessing the performance of local institutions in our case the ejidos mckay and keremane 2006 kadirbeyoglu and özertan 2015 yang et al 2018 in recent years several studies have shown that in order to understand the performance irrigation of community institutions as a whole it is central to explore the different factors that influence the success of collective action meinzen dick 2002 fujiie et al 2005 araral 2009 takayama et al 2018 3 1 biophysical and community attributes most existing studies consider that water scarcity in an irrigation system helps to promote cooperation among farmers bardhan 2000 meinzen dick et al 2002 fujiie et al 2005 araral 2009 nie et al 2020 leroy et al 2022 when individuals perceive water scarcity they have an incentive to use the resource efficiency to maximize the collective s welfare araral 2009 nie et al 2020 the influence of resource location on irrigation performance has also been emphasized indeed several research studies argue that downstream users of an irrigation system have a higher level of cooperation than upstream users because water scarcity provides an incentive for downstream users to become involved lam 1998 anderies et al 2013 ricks 2016 soliman et al 2021 another factor affecting collective action s success in managing collective irrigation systems is private access to groundwater meinzen dick et al 2002 in india show that surface irrigation systems with a large number of groundwater wells present difficulties in collective management finally gorton et al 2009 argue that the success of collective action may also be related to irrigation technique in their study in macedonia the authors find that flood irrigation requires more significant amounts of water than sprinklers irrigation which implies that these systems are more susceptible to free riding and opportunistic behavior beyond biophysical attributes community characteristics strongly influence irrigation performance for example the degree of cooperation is higher in smaller communities because transaction costs in terms of communication and compliance with rules are lower bardhan 2000 meinzen dick et al 2002 poteete and ostrom 2004 fujiie et al 2005 araral 2009 in parallel several studies consider social capital to be a critical element in the success of collective irrigation management ostrom et al 2003 pretty 2003 meinzen dick 2007 chai and zeng 2018 aoyagi et al 2022 leroy et al 2022 social capital is the features of social organization such as norms trust and shared networks that enable people to cooperate putnam 1995 ostrom et al 2003 the rich literature on social capital suggests that it can be understood through a dual process the first includes a structural dimension which explores membership in organizations farmers associations and the involvement of individuals in the collective issues of their community the second includes a cognitive dimension trust in other individuals in the community woolcock 1998 2014 aoyagi et al 2022 therefore we chose four dimensions of social capital for this study participation in a farmers association participation in collective activities the ties that bind farmers together and the trust between farmers 3 2 using the institutional analysis and development framework given the previous literature cited we used a revised version of the institutional analysis and development iad framework for the analysis ostrom 2005 fig 1 according to this framework the characteristics that influence irrigation management performance can be grouped under three categories i biophysical attributes ii community attributes and iii rules in use these attributes influence the formulation of action arenas i e meetings to develop rules and the irrigation process itself this interaction along with the rules will ultimately affect the performance of irrigation systems araral 2009 bastakoti and shivakoti 2012 wang and wu 2018 4 material and methods 4 1 site description the empirical research was conducted in four ejidos from the distrito de riego cacahoatán suchiate dr046 módulo 1 cacahoatán suchiate irrigation district module 1 located in the municipality of suchiate in the state of chiapas southern mexico fig 2 unlike the dynamic and commercialized provinces of northern mexico where irrigation district transfer and management have been widely studied few studies have analyzed irrigation district management in southern mexico more particularly in the state of chiapas which is the poorest in this country garces restrepo 2001 salas and wilson 2004 senanayake et al 2015 the distrito de riego cacahoatán suchiate dr046 was built in 1954 by the federal government and then divided into two modules in 1993 in order to transfer its administration to wuas module 1 our study area is administered by the wua called usuarios del distrito de riego del suchiate users of the suchiate irrigation district this module also has three administrative and physical subdivisions called sections section 1 is located at the head of the irrigation system section 2 in the middle and section 3 at the tail end of the system total rainfall in our study area is 1084 mm with a marked dry season from november to april which implies the development of irrigation for perennial crops such as bananas the irrigated area of module 1 of the distrito de riego cacahoatán suchiate is 6979 ha of which 5321 ha are dedicated to the cultivation of bananas and plantains udrs 2021b water is diverted directly from the suchiate river 2 3 of whose water originates in guatemala the flow of this river which forms the border between the two nations can vary from a minimum of 18 m³ s during the dry season to a maximum of 1394 m³ s during the rainy season conagua 2019 the irrigators in this irrigation system are mostly ejidatarios i e peasants who are the legal holders of the ejido land of the 845 users 705 are ejidatarios in 11 ejidos and 140 are private landowners udrs 2021a the four ejidos we selected are marked by differences in community characteristics biophysical attributes and agricultural production systems table 1 we aimed to assess whether these attributes influence irrigation management performance within ejidos empirically 4 2 analysis and data collection this study applies a mixed methods research design combining ethnographic work and quantitative surveys for data collection and analysis tashakkori and creswell 2007 we visited the distrito de riego cacahoatán suchiate dr046 módulo 1 during the months of april through june 2021 the irrigation district board of directors was the field visit s primary contact they provided an introduction to the irrigation system its rules and infrastructure we accompanied them to observe the various tasks related to the management of wua we also participated in several meetings of the board of directors and the monthly assembly finally interviews were conducted with members and employees of the wua including the irrigation supervisors and key informants conagua the purpose of these interviews was to gather information on the management of the irrigation district in a second step the board of directors introduced me to the local authorities of each selected ejido comisariado ejidal who put me in contact with the farmers the participant observation method was applied to understand the rules and practices related to irrigation management thus we spent our time in the field participating in and observing a wide range of activities of a general nature such as farming activities monitoring day to day irrigation practices formal and informal meetings and maintenance work at the same time we conducted 17 semi structured interviews with farmers in manuel ávila camacho 20 in ignacio lópez rayón 25 in la libertad and 19 in miguel alemán the sample size followed the concept of saturation i e when the collection of new data during a series of interviews produces little or no new information themes or codes mason 2010 an interview guide was prepared to address several questions related to agricultural and irrigation activities within the ejidos however the questions were open ended in order to facilitate dialogue with the farmers and the emergence of new concepts esses and maio 2002 after the semi structured interviews a questionnaire structured around themes operationalized by items on likert scales 1 5 was given to the farmers to collect data on the dependent variables table 2 these different variables were intended to assess the dimensions of the perception of water scarcity farmers satisfaction with the level of services provided by the wua the perception of compliance with water management rules within the ejidos as well as the perception of social capital the questionnaire also collected socio demographic data such as age plot size access to credit etc the semi structured interviews were transcribed and coded in maxqda qualitative data analysis in an open ended two stage process in the first stage a basic coding frame corresponding to the interview guides and participants responses was developed gibbs 2007 in the second stage this coding frame was completed inductively when the content of the data suggested multiple meanings that required a new code saldaña 2014 the responses to the questionnaire were first summarized in microsoft excel and the statistical package for the social sciences spss was used for statistical analysis the scale sum and mean were calculated for the 5 point likert scale questions for quantitative data analysis to calculate separate composite scores boone and boone 2012 a synthetic score based on the average of the variables was also calculated for each dimension we analyzed differences in dimensions and their variables for the four groups of respondents using the nonparametric kruskal wallis test a dunn s post hoc test with bonferroni type p value adjustments was used to identify the ejido s responsible for the statistically significant results finally a pearson correlation test was used to examine significant differences between farmers satisfaction with the level of services provided by the wua and perceived compliance with water management rules within the ejidos the test that was used to determine whether the results were significant is indicated in the text pearson correlation or kruskal wallis test and p represents the asymptotic significance value a p value of 0 05 or less is considered significant 5 empirical results 5 1 characteristics of the ejidos table 3 summarizes some characteristics of the farmers interviewed in the four selected ejidos the average age of the farmers the majority of whom are men 93 is 56 years the size of their plots is minimal about 4 7 ha compared to that of large landowners over 100 ha few respondents have benefited from government rural support programs in the last ten years despite the economic difficulties highlighted by the farmers agriculture remains the main activity for more than 97 of them differences in organization mark the four ejidos we selected for this study for example the ejidos miguel alemán and ignacio lópez rayón organized themselves in the 1960 1970 s as producer associations related to banana cultivation the quality requirements of this product which is exported internationally forced them to adopt a technological package that consists mainly of the use of agrochemicals strict quality and packaging control and the substitution of flood irrigation for micro sprinklers irrigation which would be impossible to adopt individually due to the size of their farms i believe that unity is strength i believe that you cannot look for a european american or japanese market alone so we need to be united to be able to make strength and to be able to carry out a good association a good partnership miguel alemán 02 male 57 yrs jun 2021 while the ejido of miguel alemán remained united around an association of banana producers that of ignacio lópez rayón became divided at the end of the 1990 s with several farmers choosing to grow plantain individually unlike bananas plantain cultivation is destined for the national market and does not require any organization for production or irrigation this crop is found in the ejidos la libertad manuel ávila camacho and ignacio lópez rayón fig 3 shows the differences in perception of social capital between these four ejidos based on the three variables farmers participation in collective activities social ties and trust in other farmers with the addition of membership in a local farmers association the kruskal wallis test reveals that the three variables differed significantly according to ejidos the post hoc analysis with bonferroni correction shows a difference between miguel alemán and the other eijdos for the social ties variable la libertad p 000 manuel ávila camacho p 001 and ignacio lópez rayón p 001 there is also a statistically significant difference between miguel alemán and la libertad for participation in collective activities p 000 and trust in other farmers p 000 finally the results show a difference between miguel alemán and the other ejidos in the dimension of social capital average of the three variables manuel ávila camacho p 003 ignacio lópez rayón p 009 and la libertad p 000 this result shows that the ejido of miguel alemán which is organized around a single association of farmers shows more substantial social capital than all the other ejidos especially with la libertad farmers of miguel alemán are characterized by strong ties higher participation in collective activities and high trust in other farmers in contrast the ejido la libertad characterized by a high number of farmers and the absence of a producers association has a lower dimension of social capital farmers in this ejido highlighted their difficulty in collectively organizing weak social ties and low trust in other farmers the people do not unite and that is why we fall into these mistakes there is no union we are all selfish we are all envious and almost no one works for the people la libertad 09 male 45 yrs apr 2021 5 2 from bureaucratic management to community institutions a multilevel governance the organizational structure of the wua consists of a general assembly a board of directors and a supervisory council the final authority in the module is the general assembly which takes place once a year all registered water users in the module the board of directors comprises a president a secretary a treasurer and a technical manager elected for three years by the general assembly it is important to emphasize that all these members are also farmers who come from different ejidos and private properties of the irrigation district this board hires the office staff and the staff in charge of water distribution in addition this administration is responsible for the maintenance of the irrigation infrastructure of drainage channels and agricultural roads other duties include writing and submitting reports to the irrigation district attending monthly and annual meetings resolving conflicts and other external negotiations including with conagua the supervisory council which acts as a link between the farmers and the board of directors comprises two representatives of the ejidos and two of the private property the representatives were called irrigation delegates and alternate irrigation delegates the delegates of each ejido are elected by popular vote at the ejido assembly the board of directors and the supervisory council meet monthly to supervise the module s operations the meeting begins at 10 00 am and usually ends at 4 00 pm it consists of 10 items including the operations and conservation report the financial report and the president s report at this meeting the ejidos and private landowners defend their interests and can sometimes be the subject of tension it is an essential action arena as it allows interaction between the irrigators represented by their delegate and the module these delegates then inform the irrigators in the monthly assembly of the ejidos as in most bureaucratic irrigation systems farmers must pay a fee to access water which depends on the crop the number of hectares and the type of irrigation for example farmers who cultivate bananas and plantains pay 1400 pesos approximately 67 us dollars per hectare when using micro sprinklers irrigation while for flood irrigation 1200 pesos approximately 58 us dollars in addition to paying the fees farmers are responsible for cleaning the irrigation canals that run alongside their plots participating in the annual meeting complying with the water turns and making rational use of water non compliance with these rules in particular non participation in maintenance work and non payment of fees implies sanctions by the user association these sanctions take the form of a temporary suspension of user rights the allocation of water throughout the irrigation module is done by three irrigation supervisors canaleros who are hired by the directors of the module s board of directors each supervisor is in charge of a section of the irrigation system he then delivers the water to the ejidos private producers or smaller social organizations which then distribute it to the farmers the modalities of water distribution differ from one ejido to another for example in the case of the banana producers associations of the ejidos ignacio lópez rayón and miguel alemán engineers paid by these associations are responsible for receiving the water delivered by the supervisors and distributing it directly to the plots every 2 3 days for plantain producers who are not organized in associations there are two modalities of water distribution that depend on the irrigation technique in fact since the 2000 s several groups of farmers have been organized for the development of small collective irrigation systems by micro sprinklers especially in ejidos la libertad and el ignacio lópez rayón these are small organizations within the ejidos themselves in this case representatives elected by these organizations are responsible for receiving the water delivered by the supervisor and distributing it to the irrigators every 2 3 days per plot according to a system of turns in the case of flood irrigation 3 3 it is important to note that unlike flood irrigation micro sprinkler irrigation systems involve an additional cost for electricity or gasoline to operate the pump the farmers request irrigation from the supervisor then water was delivered to the different plots usually every eight days in an order from upstream to downstream which requires communication within the group of irrigators as pointed out by the local authority of the ejido manuel ávila camacho we take out the list and the control of the water turns for example i finish and another producer takes it we are getting used to it we have a whatsapp group and we communicate through whatsapp manuel ávila camacho 01 male 52 yrs may 2021 although the forms of water distribution vary in the study areas sometimes with the presence of smaller organizations within the institution communities the ejidos constitute an indispensable level of organization as they act as a link that allows for a better connection between the irrigators and the bureaucratic administration of the irrigation district especially during the monthly assembly or during water distribution activities figs 4 and 5 as with the decision making processes regarding community affairs irrigation water management is discussed at the monthly ejido assembly allowing farmers to establish the main points developed at the irrigation module assembly until the mid 2010 s the three irrigation system sections received water daily however since then recurrent water shortage problems within the irrigation district have forced the management board to ration the resource thus during dry periods each section receives water only two days out of three as farmers share water locally this implies less frequent water turns every 3 4 days for micro sprinklers irrigation and every 12 15 days for flood irrigation due to the decreasing water availability from the irrigation district many farmers have chosen to tap groundwater for example 28 of the la libertad farmers interviewed invested in private wells while the banana associations invested in collective wells however due to the ocean s proximity the two wells of the miguel alemán ejido could never be exploited because of the excessive salinity of the water fig 6 shows the perception of water scarcity in the four ejidos the kruskal wallis test shows that there is no significant difference in the perception of water scarcity among the four ejidos despite their differences in biophysical characteristics such as location irrigation technique or access to groundwater 5 3 how do farmers perceive the irrigation management performance of the wua and their ejido fig 7 shows the degree of satisfaction of farmers with the level of services provided by the wua these services refer to the supervisors role in water delivery equity in water distribution the role of the wua board of directors maintenance of irrigation infrastructure and conflict resolution the kruskal wallis test shows that only the equity in water distribution variable presents a difference related to the ejidos p 024 especially between farmers in ignacio lópez rayón and those in la libertad p 035 moreover the results show that farmers in ignacio lópez rayón are more satisfied average of the five variables than those in la libertad p 032 forty four percent of the farmers in la libertad claim to be very dissatisfied with the equity of water distribution for them the large landowners upstream of their farms monopolize the irrigation water as this farmer points out i have one hectare and he has 130 and he sends us what he has left over if he wants la libertad 15 male 43 yrs apr 2021 some denounce the corrupt practices of the irrigation supervisors who are said to be paid by the large landowners to give them more water this situation explains why they are less satisfied with the role of the supervisors than other ejidos problems of water sharing are sometimes the cause of tensions between farmers but also between ejidos for example the local authorities of the ejido of miguel alemán have denounced the use of water by the farmers of la libertad when it comes to important conflicts such as those between la libertad farmers and large landowners the issue is brought to the wua however only 47 of farmers say they are satisfied with the resolution of conflicts over water which can be particularly violent at times thirty percent of farmers say they are not satisfied with the maintenance of the infrastructure which has been severely degraded since hurricane stan hit in 2005 indeed during this event the water intake of the irrigation system was damaged by floods and the deposit of sediments in the suchiate international river finally only 43 of the farmers claim to be satisfied and very satisfied with the wua board of directors farmers feel that maintenance or water distribution services need to improve as they pay a monthly fee fig 8 shows the perceived compliance with different rules within the ejidos these rules refer to compliance with water turns rational resource management payment of fees maintenance of irrigation canals and attendance at annual wua meetings the kruskal wallis test reveals that these five variables differed significantly according to the ejidos in general farmers in miguel alemán perceive better water management performance average of the 5 variables at the local level than those in la libertad p 000 as the posthoc analysis with bonferroni correction shows this difference is statistically significant for payment of fees p 000 participation in meetings p 000 water turns p 007 rationalization of water use p 005 and canal maintenance p 004 to a lesser extent the result shows a significance difference in the perceived of compliance with water management rules between the ejidos miguel alemán and manuel ávila camacho p 026 this difference is statistically significant for the water turns p 002 the payment of fees is the most complied rule by farmers for them it is the basis for access to water in the case of banana producer associations these fees are paid directly by the association in the case of farmers who irrigate by flooding they must provide proof of payment in order to request water turns each week which obliges them to comply with this payment however payment problems are more significant for farmers who irrigate with micro sprinklers as supervisors cannot suspend distribution to the entire group if some do not pay thus there are many cases of opportunistic behavior especially among farmers in la libertad due to the size of the group seventy nine percent of the farmers of miguel alemán perceive it important and very important to comply with the water turns which the engineers of the banana association establish on the other hand the la libertad and manuel ávila camacho farmers consider that the water turns are not always well complied with non compliance with turns is common among farmers who irrigate by flooding as water is supplied to the different plots in an upstream downstream order however some upstream farmers do not comply with the time allotted or steal the water turn in the case of the la libertad farmers who irrigate with micro sprinklers the problem of water sharing is rather related to the high number of farmers which implies organizational difficulties non compliance with water turns is now the main cause of conflict within ejidos while conflicts can sometimes be violent and require the intervention of the board of directors of the wua most are usually resolved at the local level by the community authorities or the person in charge of controlling the water turns sometimes some problems arise but they are solved the comisariado gives us other alternatives look do not bother it has a solution manuel ávila camacho 05 male 35 yrs may 2021 sixty percent of farmers consider that canal maintenance activities are complied or highly complied this participation implies a renewal of rights and obligations as community members and water users to maintain their systems and have optimal canals for irrigation as this farmer points out if you do not do it you are sanctioned they stop the water until you go and clean your canal that corresponds to you it is more than nothing la libertad 12 male 42 yrs apr 2021 generally canal cleaning begins during the rainy season when irrigation use is no longer required the irrigation supervisor informs the farmers to discuss when the cleaning should start and when the users should hand over the cleaned canals finally fifty four percent of the farmers consider that attendance at the annual meeting is complied or very complied while this perception is very strong among miguel alemán the farmers of la libertad consider that few of them participate in this event fig 9 shows the comparison between the perception of irrigation management performance of the wua and the perception of irrigation management performance within each ejido although fig 9 shows that the values of the dimensions satisfaction with the wua and compliance with the rules are relatively similar within the ejidos of manuel ávila camacho ignacio lópez rayón and la libertad the pearson test shows that there is a significant correlation only for the farmers taken individually of the ejido manuel ávila camacho p 032 this means that there is a relationship between the satisfaction of farmers in this ejido with the services provided by the wua and their perception of the performance of irrigation management at the community level for farmers in miguel alemán this correlation is not significant 6 discussion 6 1 the role of community based water management institutions in the mexican irrigation districts since the 1980 s the imt has been a central element of institutional and economic reforms in the irrigation sector across the globe particularly in developing countries vermillion 1997 senanayake et al 2015 unlike the self management of small scale irrigation systems where the irrigators operate the system the transfer of management to mexican irrigation district users followed the path of bureaucratic management hunt 1989 johnson 1997 salas and wilson 2004 palerm viqueira 2014 while this management model consisted of an operation entirely in the hands of contracted agents with a unified command palerm viqueira 2014 this study has highlighted the role of community institutions linking the irrigator to the administration in charge of water management following the work of cox 2014 and dell angelo et al 2014 we consider that multilevel institutional arrangements that integrate elements of governance at the local level would produce more robust governance systems mirroring several empirical studies we have shown that these institutions are fundamental to water management within mexican irrigation districts as they allow for water distribution tailored to the local requirements and conditions of each ejido montés de oca hernández et al 2012 romero lópez and palerm viquiera 2018 palerm viqueira 2020 furthermore these community institutions play a role in resolving conflicts at the local level which avoids involving and saturating the wua palerm viqueira 2020 in light of these empirical studies and our results we consider the role of community institutions as one of the factors in the successful transfer of mexican irrigation systems to users indeed several studies point out that the wuas demonstrated their ability to manage even the largest modules could be considered a sign of success johnson 1997 rap 2006 however these studies do not address the role of community institutions other studies have attributed the success of the imt to the economic model of the dynamic and commercialized provinces of the north northwest and northeast of the country where agriculture and agribusiness are a mainstay of the local economy garces restrepo 2001 salas and wilson 2004 senanayake et al 2015 however our case study located in the southernmost and poorest area of mexico shows the capacity for self management of the irrigation district especially through community institutions this result also shows that beyond the opposition between large scale infrastructure based development strategies big is beautiful and small scale development strategies at the village or community level small is beautiful see for example adams 1990 smith 2018 there is an alternative model that reconciles both this study thus suggests that bureaucratic management within large scale irrigation systems does not necessarily mean the end of local knowledge systems while this study highlights the role of community institutions in water management in irrigation districts it was essential to explore how farmers perceive performance regarding the level of services provided by the wua before being managed by community institutions access to the resource is determined by bureaucratic management which is responsible for water distribution and infrastructure maintenance at the module 1 irrigation district level the results show that farmers satisfaction with the level of wua service provision varies among the ejidos studied for example it is higher in the ejido ignacio lópez rayón and lower in the ejido la libertad it is possible that the satisfaction of farmers in the ejido ignacio lópez rayón is related to the advantageous position of the community at the beginning of section 2 of the irrigation system and directly on the central canal this allows in the first place to have easier access to the resource than for example the farmers of la libertad which is located downstream of a secondary canal for this reason the farmers of ignacio lópez rayón are relatively satisfied with the work of the irrigation supervisor and perceive a fair distribution of the resource in addition since the central canal infrastructure is the best maintained by the district farmers are also more satisfied with maintenance activities in the case of farmers in la libertad conflicts related to large landowners cause low satisfaction with the fairness of water distribution the work of the supervisor who is often accused of corruption and the resolution of conflicts however the results show that there is no relationship between farmers satisfaction with the wua service provision and the perception of compliance with water management rules in the ejidos the ignacio lópez rayón la libertad and miguel alemán this shows that these farmers do not perceive a correlation between the two main organizational levels of the irrigation district unlike the farmers in manuel ávila camacho one of the reasons for the results obtained in this ejido may be related to the sharing of water by flooding which implies the presence of the irrigation district supervisor in the definition of water turns the fact of using only this method of irrigation la libertad uses it partially therefore entails a closer relationship with the district unlike the other ejidos that have engineers or representatives for water sharing finally the case of farmers in miguel alemán shows that highly organized farmers can perceive better performance at the local level regardless of bureaucratic management several physical and social factors can explain this perceived performance 6 2 how do physical and social factors influence the institutional performance of irrigation management the results suggest a link between community characteristics and institutional performance of irrigation management fig 10 for example the ejido miguel alemán characterized by a small group membership in a single association and high social capital shows the best institutional irrigation performance at the local level in contrast the ejido la libertad characterized by a large group the absence of a farmers association and low social capital has the lowest institutional performance of irrigation management thus the study suggests that farmers membership in an association is a central element of social capital indeed farmers in miguel alemán who are united around a single association are characterized by strong social ties trusting relationships and high participation in collective activities these different dimensions of social capital promote greater compliance with irrigation rules similar to several studies this result confirms a clear link between social capital and successful collective irrigation management pretty 2003 ostrom et al 2003 meinzen dick et al 2007 chai and zeng 2018 aoyagi et al 2022 leroy et al 2022 the case of the la libertad ejido farmers which includes the largest number of irrigators in the irrigation district 201 irrigators and is characterized by distribution problems and recurrent conflicts provides evidence that group size influences irrigation management performance this result is consistent with several works that point out that it is more difficult for large organizations to collaborate bardhan 2000 meinzen dick et al 2002 fujiie et al 2005 araral 2009 takayama et al 2018 one might even be tempted to argue that group size affects social capital which affects cooperation however beyond social factors the study mounts that it is also important to consider biophysical attributes araral 2013 wang et al 2013 for example although small group sizes 35 irrigators characterize the farmers of manuel ávila camacho these farmers experience difficulties in sharing water turns especially due to the practice of flood irrigation which more easily implies opportunistic behavior this result is in line with gorton et al 2009 who found in their study in macedonia that performance is significantly lower when using flood irrigation than when using sprinklers the result also illustrates that the ejido of la libertad with an increasing number of groundwater wells has shown a lower performance however according to the farmers this dynamic is primarily related to the decrease in the amount of water during the dry season problems of equity in water distribution and the high number of farmers thus groundwater exploitation may be more a consequence of poor institutional irrigation performance within the ejido finally the case of miguel alemán suggests that the community s location at the tail end of the irrigation system is also a factor that can influence irrigation performance lam 1998 anderies et al 2013 ricks 2016 soliman et al 2021 indeed when water becomes scarce during the dry season resource distribution operations coordination is essential to irrigate all plots however since engineers manage water distribution is more manageable than if it had to be done by all farmers while the study suggests that physical factors such as location irrigation technique or access to groundwater influence the performance of irrigation management the results show that these characteristics do not influence the perception of water scarcity which is relatively similar within the four ejidos however the perception of water scarcity is not only related to the biophysical conditions of the resource but also to the social factors of its management i e how water is delivered allocated and used fan et al 2019 this may explain why miguel alemán farmers who are at the end of the irrigation system and do not have access to groundwater do not perceive as much water scarcity due to the institutional performance of their ejido s irrigation management however it is complex and artificial to determine which community attributes and biophysical attributes have the most significant impact on the institutional performance of irrigation management instead it is the combination of these factors that influence performance for example the results show that irrigation performance is higher in the miguel alemán ejido due to the characteristics of the group small scale community presence of farmers association social capital and the characteristics of the resource micro sprinklers irrigation position at the tail end of the system and no access to groundwater on the other hand it is weaker in the ejido la libertad due to the high number of farmers and low social capital implying a lack of organization that can push farmers to exploit groundwater 7 conclusions and policy implications this study provides empirical evidence on community institutions role importance and performance in large scale irrigation systems with non governmental bureaucratic administration we have shown that these community institutions are essential as they allow water to be provided to individual irrigators from a resource the bureaucracy provides moreover these institutions play a role in resolving conflicts at the local level which avoids involving and saturating the hierarchical levels of the wua thus the role of this community institution is to act as a link that allows a better connection between farmers and the wua however although all four communities use water from the same irrigation district the results show that the institutional performance of irrigation management within ejidos varies considerably using the iad framework developed by ostrom 2005 we showed that these differences could be explained by the biophysical attributes involved in irrigation irrigation technique access to groundwater resources location of the water intake and community characteristics social capital and group size among these factors the results show that social capital plays a fundamental role as shown by the case of miguel alemán ejido which is united around a single association of producers therefore the study recommends that water and resource managers involve ejidos in creating farmer associations which could increase their social capital market access and local irrigation performance in addition the problems of compliance with water turn among farmers who irrigate by flooding especially in manuel ávila camacho show the necessity of adopting micro sprinklers irrigation if this technology is much more water efficient the results show that it also implies a better water management organization at the local level finally the low satisfaction of farmers with wua service provision particularly in la libertad points to the need for a more equitable distribution of the resource within the irrigation district and a better conflict resolution system in conclusion farmers views on the institutional performance of irrigation management should receive more attention in the large scale irrigation system with bureaucratic administration this knowledge can be particularly useful to improve the different levels of organization and thus water governance of irrigation districts in mexico funding this study was funded by the universidad nacional autónoma de méxico programa deapoyo a proyectos

9160,understanding irrigation performance by focusing on its institutional dimension can help improve water use and smallholder farmers livelihoods while many studies have evaluated the institutional performance of small scale farmer managed irrigation systems virtually no empirical studies have evaluated the performance of community based water management institutions in large scale irrigation systems with non governmental bureaucratic administration this study aims to fill this gap using a mixed methods research design combining ethnographic work and a quantitative survey of 81 smallholder farmers from four community institutions ejidos in an irrigation district in chiapas southern mexico while the management model implemented in the transfer of mexican irrigation districts to users consisted of a bureaucratic administration entirely in the hands of contract agents this study reveals the essential role of community institutions in local water management however although all four communities use water from the same irrigation district the results revealed significant differences in the institutional performance of irrigation management using the institutional analysis and development iad framework developed by elinor ostrom we showed that these differences could be explained by the biophysical attributes involved in irrigation irrigation technique access to groundwater resources location of the water intake and community characteristics social capital and group size the study recommends that water managers involve communities in the creation of farmers associations which could increase their social capital and thus the performance of local irrigation furthermore the results suggest that farmers views on the institutional performance of irrigation management should receive more attention in the large scale irrigation system with bureaucratic administration this knowledge can be particularly useful to improve the different levels of organization and thus water governance of irrigation districts in mexico keywords institution bureaucratic irrigation system collective action mixed methods research design ejido data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction in the 20th century the irrigated area grew significantly worldwide due to investments by governments development banks and other international donor funds in large scale irrigation infrastructure in most cases the management of new irrigation projects was placed in the hands of government agencies with little or no involvement of new irrigators vermillion 1997 senanayake et al 2015 however in the following decades the performance of these new irrigation systems did not meet the expected goals mollinga et al 2007 state run irrigation systems have been affected by financial difficulties related to low operation and maintenance fees and difficulties in collecting them these management problems led to the degradation of irrigation infrastructure unreliable water supply and a lack of significant improvements in agricultural productivity chambers 1980 wade and chambers 1980 uphoff et al 1986 playán et al 2018 to address these problems many governments implemented irrigation management transfer imt programs garces restrepo et al 2007 vermillion 1997 these reforms were encouraged by structural adjustment programs administered by international financial institutions such as the international monetary fund imf and the world bank in order for national governments to reduce their range of responsibilities and activities in public service delivery konadu agyemang 2000 suhardiman and giordano 2014 these institutional and economic reforms have led to the transfer of irrigation system operation and maintenance responsibilities from public services to decentralized community agencies or local organizations vermillion 1997 johnson 1997 suhardiman et al 2014 during the process of imt water user associations wuas were considered essential elements of the new management model wegerich 2010 this statement was based on the success of self management in small scale traditional or indigenous systems in which irrigators were smallholder farmers including the case studies of the bali subak the nepalese kulos the zanjera in the ilocos region in the philippines as well as the case of promoting self management in gal oya sri lanka coward 1979 uphoff 1986 hunt 1989 ostrom 1990 wijayaratna and uphoff 1997 meinzen dick 2007 some studies have thus shown that the success of self management is linked to the creation of community institutions adapted to local conditions ostrom 1990 agrawal 2001 meinzen dick 2007 these institutions determine a set of rules norms and values that make collective action possible ostrom 1990 dietz et al 2003 roggero et al 2018 organizations then intervene in an institutional context that legitimizes them and to which they must comply ostrom 1990 concerning irrigation system management these institutions are fundamental to water sharing among farmers conflict resolution and infrastructure maintenance ostrom 1990 meinzen dick 2007 bastakoti and shivakoti 2012 leroy et al 2022 compliance with rules notably through a system of control and sanction determines the institutional performance meinzen dick 2007 in recent decades empirical studies on the institutional performance of irrigation systems have flourished as they provide insights into how rules affect collective action and thus the sustainability of irrigated agriculture lam and ostrom 2010 bastakoti and shivakoti 2012 wang et al 2013 leroy et al 2022 while the institutional performance of small scale irrigation systems has been widely demonstrated it is more difficult for groups of irrigators to manage large scale 1 1 for the purposes of this study bureaucratic irrigation systems are considered large and traditional or indigenous systems small hunt 1979 irrigation systems coward 1979 hunt 1989 ostrom 1992 yoder 1994 meinzen dick 2007 some authors therefore emphasize the need for an administrative management apparatus with specialized staff constituting a bureaucracy in large scale irrigation systems while small scale irrigation systems can do without such specialized staff vaidyanathan 1999 palerm viqueira 2020 this form of management described as bureaucratic has been highlighted in argentina s mendoza province peru palerm viqueira 2010 2014 turkey svendsen and nott 2000 colombia bruns and meinzen dick 2000 and mexico hunt 1989 romero lópez and palerm viquiera 2018 palerm viqueira 2020 among others however some authors point out that community institutions play an essential role even in a bureaucratic type of management freeman et al 1989 point out the advantages of local organizations that link irrigators to the administration in charge of water management in his study of babylonian irrigation glick 1972 points out that state bureaucracy relies on local organizations and local knowledge hunt 1989 romero lópez palerm viquiera 2018 and palerm viqueira 2020 highlight the significant presence of local organizations involved in water distribution and maintenance within mexican irrigation districts while many studies have assessed the institutional performance of small scale farmer self managed irrigation systems see for example lam 1998 bardhan 2000 araral 2009 bastakoti and shivakoti 2012 leroy et al 2022 virtually no empirical studies have assessed the performance of community based water management institutions in large scale irrigation with non governmental bureaucratic administration understanding the performance of irrigation by focusing on its institutional dimension at the local level can be useful for improving water use and smallholder livelihoods within the large scale irrigation system this study aims to assess the institutional performance of community based water management in a large scale irrigation system with non governmental bureaucratic administration to this end we conducted a mixed methods study combining ethnographic work and a quantitative survey with 81 farmers from four community institutions ejidos in an irrigation district in chiapas southern mexico the questions guiding this research were 1 what is the role importance and performance of community based water management institutions in irrigation systems with bureaucratic administration 2 what factors explain the differences in irrigation management performance of community institutions 3 is there a relationship between farmers satisfaction with the services provided by the wua and their perceptions of community level irrigation management performance the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 provides an overview of mexican irrigation districts and the community institutions that are ejidos section 3 proposes an analytical framework to assess the performance of institutions within a bureaucratic irrigation system and the factors that influence this performance section 4 discusses the proposed methodology and section 5 presents empirical results section 6 summarizes and discusses the main results in section 7 the conclusion includes an overview of the policy implications of this research 2 irrigation districts and ejidos in mexico in mexico irrigation districts distritos de riego are defined as large scale irrigation systems that were developed in most cases in the second half of the 20th century as part of a public policy to promote the country s agricultural development johnson 1997 salas and wilson 2004 it differs from irrigation units unidades de riego which are small essentially independent irrigation systems that users have formally or informally managed since their inception eighty six irrigation districts and over 40 000 irrigation units are registered by the national water agency 2 2 comisión nacional del agua conagua national water agency is a decentralised administrative body of the federal ministry of the environment and natural resources in charge of the management regulation control and protection of mexican water resources conagua in mexico conagua 2016 one of the most critical reforms developed by the mexican agricultural sector in recent decades is the transfer of irrigation districts to users arreguin cortes et al 2019 this transfer began in 1988 and was spurred by the state s global downsizing policies global proposals for an irrigation district transfer policy and the economic crisis in mexico johnson 1997 salas and wilson 2004 the objectives of the imt reform were to promote more efficient operation and maintenance of irrigation districts while increasing agricultural productivity it was also intended to improve water distribution promoting equity in resource management finally the imt was also intended to free up government resources that could be reallocated to other uses in mexico salas and wilson 2004 as a result several authors have highlighted the success of the irrigation district transfer program to users in mexico particularly in the northern regions johnson 1997 salas and wilson 2004 senanayake et al 2015 while this reform consisted of transferring the hydraulic infrastructure to the farmers it was proposed that only the minor irrigation network would be ceded while conagua would retain the operation of the headworks irrigation districts were divided into modules módulos to transfer their administration to water users associations wuas johnson 1997 arreguin cortes et al 2019 unlike irrigation units that facilitate an operation carried out by the irrigators themselves the organizational design of the irrigation district modules is centralized by a board of directors chosen and appointed by the water users which hires the office staff and water distribution supervisors canaleros and handles maintenance using the machinery johnson 1997 vermillion 1997 palerm viqueira 2006 arreguin cortes et al 2019 the water is distributed to different users including private landowners indigenous communities and ejidos in this study we focus on ejidos farming communities created as part of the agrarian reform program that emerged from the mexican revolution 1910 1920 nuijten 2004 within the ejidos decision making and rule making processes regarding the use and management of common lands and water are carried out by the assembly which is the supreme body of the ejido ejidos are recognized as communities that facilitate institutional arrangements for controlling access as well as rights over resources mckean 2000 monroy sais et al 2016 this makes the ejido an excellent community institution for exploring irrigation performance 3 theoretical background institutional irrigation performance most studies on irrigation performance assessment focus on financial and physical indicators córcoles et al 2010 elshaikh et al 2018 awada et al 2019 however several studies have shown that institutional arrangements i e usage rules created by farmers are critical for high irrigation performance lam and ostrom 2010 bastakoti and shivakoti 2012 wang et al 2013 roggero et al 2018 wang and wu 2018 soliman et al 2021 leroy et al 2022 based on these studies we consider that institutional performance of collective irrigation can be achieved through compliance with rules and thus the successful implementation of activities such as maintenance of irrigation infrastructure allocation coordination equitable distribution of water payment of fees participation in meetings and conflict resolution empirical studies have demonstrated that within a single irrigation system multiple organizational levels can be highly correlated with the operational levels of the system coward 1979 pradhan 1989 1990 cox 2014 dell angelo et al 2014 2016 these multiple levels of governance are characteristic of large scale irrigation systems characterized by an administration of a bureaucratic nature palerm viqueira 2009 freeman and angin 1999 emphasize the role of intermediary organizations between the irrigator and the bureaucratic administration i e a community institution that combines technical knowledge on managing water with in depth knowledge of the local situation romero lópez palerm viquiera 2018 and palerm viqueira 2020 have shown through several mexican case studies that the best way to match the bureaucratic and local levels is through an intermediate level of organizations the two levels of governance that characterize the irrigation system studied lead to an evaluation of the institutional performance of the wua and the community institutions in this research we emphasize the farmers point of view i e their perception of irrigation management performance for example several studies have suggested that users satisfaction with the level of wua service provision is an effective method of assessing irrigation management performance gorton et al 2009 shivakoti and thapa 2005 uysal and atış 2010 other work has shown that perceived compliance with water management rules can be a reliable indicator for assessing the performance of local institutions in our case the ejidos mckay and keremane 2006 kadirbeyoglu and özertan 2015 yang et al 2018 in recent years several studies have shown that in order to understand the performance irrigation of community institutions as a whole it is central to explore the different factors that influence the success of collective action meinzen dick 2002 fujiie et al 2005 araral 2009 takayama et al 2018 3 1 biophysical and community attributes most existing studies consider that water scarcity in an irrigation system helps to promote cooperation among farmers bardhan 2000 meinzen dick et al 2002 fujiie et al 2005 araral 2009 nie et al 2020 leroy et al 2022 when individuals perceive water scarcity they have an incentive to use the resource efficiency to maximize the collective s welfare araral 2009 nie et al 2020 the influence of resource location on irrigation performance has also been emphasized indeed several research studies argue that downstream users of an irrigation system have a higher level of cooperation than upstream users because water scarcity provides an incentive for downstream users to become involved lam 1998 anderies et al 2013 ricks 2016 soliman et al 2021 another factor affecting collective action s success in managing collective irrigation systems is private access to groundwater meinzen dick et al 2002 in india show that surface irrigation systems with a large number of groundwater wells present difficulties in collective management finally gorton et al 2009 argue that the success of collective action may also be related to irrigation technique in their study in macedonia the authors find that flood irrigation requires more significant amounts of water than sprinklers irrigation which implies that these systems are more susceptible to free riding and opportunistic behavior beyond biophysical attributes community characteristics strongly influence irrigation performance for example the degree of cooperation is higher in smaller communities because transaction costs in terms of communication and compliance with rules are lower bardhan 2000 meinzen dick et al 2002 poteete and ostrom 2004 fujiie et al 2005 araral 2009 in parallel several studies consider social capital to be a critical element in the success of collective irrigation management ostrom et al 2003 pretty 2003 meinzen dick 2007 chai and zeng 2018 aoyagi et al 2022 leroy et al 2022 social capital is the features of social organization such as norms trust and shared networks that enable people to cooperate putnam 1995 ostrom et al 2003 the rich literature on social capital suggests that it can be understood through a dual process the first includes a structural dimension which explores membership in organizations farmers associations and the involvement of individuals in the collective issues of their community the second includes a cognitive dimension trust in other individuals in the community woolcock 1998 2014 aoyagi et al 2022 therefore we chose four dimensions of social capital for this study participation in a farmers association participation in collective activities the ties that bind farmers together and the trust between farmers 3 2 using the institutional analysis and development framework given the previous literature cited we used a revised version of the institutional analysis and development iad framework for the analysis ostrom 2005 fig 1 according to this framework the characteristics that influence irrigation management performance can be grouped under three categories i biophysical attributes ii community attributes and iii rules in use these attributes influence the formulation of action arenas i e meetings to develop rules and the irrigation process itself this interaction along with the rules will ultimately affect the performance of irrigation systems araral 2009 bastakoti and shivakoti 2012 wang and wu 2018 4 material and methods 4 1 site description the empirical research was conducted in four ejidos from the distrito de riego cacahoatán suchiate dr046 módulo 1 cacahoatán suchiate irrigation district module 1 located in the municipality of suchiate in the state of chiapas southern mexico fig 2 unlike the dynamic and commercialized provinces of northern mexico where irrigation district transfer and management have been widely studied few studies have analyzed irrigation district management in southern mexico more particularly in the state of chiapas which is the poorest in this country garces restrepo 2001 salas and wilson 2004 senanayake et al 2015 the distrito de riego cacahoatán suchiate dr046 was built in 1954 by the federal government and then divided into two modules in 1993 in order to transfer its administration to wuas module 1 our study area is administered by the wua called usuarios del distrito de riego del suchiate users of the suchiate irrigation district this module also has three administrative and physical subdivisions called sections section 1 is located at the head of the irrigation system section 2 in the middle and section 3 at the tail end of the system total rainfall in our study area is 1084 mm with a marked dry season from november to april which implies the development of irrigation for perennial crops such as bananas the irrigated area of module 1 of the distrito de riego cacahoatán suchiate is 6979 ha of which 5321 ha are dedicated to the cultivation of bananas and plantains udrs 2021b water is diverted directly from the suchiate river 2 3 of whose water originates in guatemala the flow of this river which forms the border between the two nations can vary from a minimum of 18 m³ s during the dry season to a maximum of 1394 m³ s during the rainy season conagua 2019 the irrigators in this irrigation system are mostly ejidatarios i e peasants who are the legal holders of the ejido land of the 845 users 705 are ejidatarios in 11 ejidos and 140 are private landowners udrs 2021a the four ejidos we selected are marked by differences in community characteristics biophysical attributes and agricultural production systems table 1 we aimed to assess whether these attributes influence irrigation management performance within ejidos empirically 4 2 analysis and data collection this study applies a mixed methods research design combining ethnographic work and quantitative surveys for data collection and analysis tashakkori and creswell 2007 we visited the distrito de riego cacahoatán suchiate dr046 módulo 1 during the months of april through june 2021 the irrigation district board of directors was the field visit s primary contact they provided an introduction to the irrigation system its rules and infrastructure we accompanied them to observe the various tasks related to the management of wua we also participated in several meetings of the board of directors and the monthly assembly finally interviews were conducted with members and employees of the wua including the irrigation supervisors and key informants conagua the purpose of these interviews was to gather information on the management of the irrigation district in a second step the board of directors introduced me to the local authorities of each selected ejido comisariado ejidal who put me in contact with the farmers the participant observation method was applied to understand the rules and practices related to irrigation management thus we spent our time in the field participating in and observing a wide range of activities of a general nature such as farming activities monitoring day to day irrigation practices formal and informal meetings and maintenance work at the same time we conducted 17 semi structured interviews with farmers in manuel ávila camacho 20 in ignacio lópez rayón 25 in la libertad and 19 in miguel alemán the sample size followed the concept of saturation i e when the collection of new data during a series of interviews produces little or no new information themes or codes mason 2010 an interview guide was prepared to address several questions related to agricultural and irrigation activities within the ejidos however the questions were open ended in order to facilitate dialogue with the farmers and the emergence of new concepts esses and maio 2002 after the semi structured interviews a questionnaire structured around themes operationalized by items on likert scales 1 5 was given to the farmers to collect data on the dependent variables table 2 these different variables were intended to assess the dimensions of the perception of water scarcity farmers satisfaction with the level of services provided by the wua the perception of compliance with water management rules within the ejidos as well as the perception of social capital the questionnaire also collected socio demographic data such as age plot size access to credit etc the semi structured interviews were transcribed and coded in maxqda qualitative data analysis in an open ended two stage process in the first stage a basic coding frame corresponding to the interview guides and participants responses was developed gibbs 2007 in the second stage this coding frame was completed inductively when the content of the data suggested multiple meanings that required a new code saldaña 2014 the responses to the questionnaire were first summarized in microsoft excel and the statistical package for the social sciences spss was used for statistical analysis the scale sum and mean were calculated for the 5 point likert scale questions for quantitative data analysis to calculate separate composite scores boone and boone 2012 a synthetic score based on the average of the variables was also calculated for each dimension we analyzed differences in dimensions and their variables for the four groups of respondents using the nonparametric kruskal wallis test a dunn s post hoc test with bonferroni type p value adjustments was used to identify the ejido s responsible for the statistically significant results finally a pearson correlation test was used to examine significant differences between farmers satisfaction with the level of services provided by the wua and perceived compliance with water management rules within the ejidos the test that was used to determine whether the results were significant is indicated in the text pearson correlation or kruskal wallis test and p represents the asymptotic significance value a p value of 0 05 or less is considered significant 5 empirical results 5 1 characteristics of the ejidos table 3 summarizes some characteristics of the farmers interviewed in the four selected ejidos the average age of the farmers the majority of whom are men 93 is 56 years the size of their plots is minimal about 4 7 ha compared to that of large landowners over 100 ha few respondents have benefited from government rural support programs in the last ten years despite the economic difficulties highlighted by the farmers agriculture remains the main activity for more than 97 of them differences in organization mark the four ejidos we selected for this study for example the ejidos miguel alemán and ignacio lópez rayón organized themselves in the 1960 1970 s as producer associations related to banana cultivation the quality requirements of this product which is exported internationally forced them to adopt a technological package that consists mainly of the use of agrochemicals strict quality and packaging control and the substitution of flood irrigation for micro sprinklers irrigation which would be impossible to adopt individually due to the size of their farms i believe that unity is strength i believe that you cannot look for a european american or japanese market alone so we need to be united to be able to make strength and to be able to carry out a good association a good partnership miguel alemán 02 male 57 yrs jun 2021 while the ejido of miguel alemán remained united around an association of banana producers that of ignacio lópez rayón became divided at the end of the 1990 s with several farmers choosing to grow plantain individually unlike bananas plantain cultivation is destined for the national market and does not require any organization for production or irrigation this crop is found in the ejidos la libertad manuel ávila camacho and ignacio lópez rayón fig 3 shows the differences in perception of social capital between these four ejidos based on the three variables farmers participation in collective activities social ties and trust in other farmers with the addition of membership in a local farmers association the kruskal wallis test reveals that the three variables differed significantly according to ejidos the post hoc analysis with bonferroni correction shows a difference between miguel alemán and the other eijdos for the social ties variable la libertad p 000 manuel ávila camacho p 001 and ignacio lópez rayón p 001 there is also a statistically significant difference between miguel alemán and la libertad for participation in collective activities p 000 and trust in other farmers p 000 finally the results show a difference between miguel alemán and the other ejidos in the dimension of social capital average of the three variables manuel ávila camacho p 003 ignacio lópez rayón p 009 and la libertad p 000 this result shows that the ejido of miguel alemán which is organized around a single association of farmers shows more substantial social capital than all the other ejidos especially with la libertad farmers of miguel alemán are characterized by strong ties higher participation in collective activities and high trust in other farmers in contrast the ejido la libertad characterized by a high number of farmers and the absence of a producers association has a lower dimension of social capital farmers in this ejido highlighted their difficulty in collectively organizing weak social ties and low trust in other farmers the people do not unite and that is why we fall into these mistakes there is no union we are all selfish we are all envious and almost no one works for the people la libertad 09 male 45 yrs apr 2021 5 2 from bureaucratic management to community institutions a multilevel governance the organizational structure of the wua consists of a general assembly a board of directors and a supervisory council the final authority in the module is the general assembly which takes place once a year all registered water users in the module the board of directors comprises a president a secretary a treasurer and a technical manager elected for three years by the general assembly it is important to emphasize that all these members are also farmers who come from different ejidos and private properties of the irrigation district this board hires the office staff and the staff in charge of water distribution in addition this administration is responsible for the maintenance of the irrigation infrastructure of drainage channels and agricultural roads other duties include writing and submitting reports to the irrigation district attending monthly and annual meetings resolving conflicts and other external negotiations including with conagua the supervisory council which acts as a link between the farmers and the board of directors comprises two representatives of the ejidos and two of the private property the representatives were called irrigation delegates and alternate irrigation delegates the delegates of each ejido are elected by popular vote at the ejido assembly the board of directors and the supervisory council meet monthly to supervise the module s operations the meeting begins at 10 00 am and usually ends at 4 00 pm it consists of 10 items including the operations and conservation report the financial report and the president s report at this meeting the ejidos and private landowners defend their interests and can sometimes be the subject of tension it is an essential action arena as it allows interaction between the irrigators represented by their delegate and the module these delegates then inform the irrigators in the monthly assembly of the ejidos as in most bureaucratic irrigation systems farmers must pay a fee to access water which depends on the crop the number of hectares and the type of irrigation for example farmers who cultivate bananas and plantains pay 1400 pesos approximately 67 us dollars per hectare when using micro sprinklers irrigation while for flood irrigation 1200 pesos approximately 58 us dollars in addition to paying the fees farmers are responsible for cleaning the irrigation canals that run alongside their plots participating in the annual meeting complying with the water turns and making rational use of water non compliance with these rules in particular non participation in maintenance work and non payment of fees implies sanctions by the user association these sanctions take the form of a temporary suspension of user rights the allocation of water throughout the irrigation module is done by three irrigation supervisors canaleros who are hired by the directors of the module s board of directors each supervisor is in charge of a section of the irrigation system he then delivers the water to the ejidos private producers or smaller social organizations which then distribute it to the farmers the modalities of water distribution differ from one ejido to another for example in the case of the banana producers associations of the ejidos ignacio lópez rayón and miguel alemán engineers paid by these associations are responsible for receiving the water delivered by the supervisors and distributing it directly to the plots every 2 3 days for plantain producers who are not organized in associations there are two modalities of water distribution that depend on the irrigation technique in fact since the 2000 s several groups of farmers have been organized for the development of small collective irrigation systems by micro sprinklers especially in ejidos la libertad and el ignacio lópez rayón these are small organizations within the ejidos themselves in this case representatives elected by these organizations are responsible for receiving the water delivered by the supervisor and distributing it to the irrigators every 2 3 days per plot according to a system of turns in the case of flood irrigation 3 3 it is important to note that unlike flood irrigation micro sprinkler irrigation systems involve an additional cost for electricity or gasoline to operate the pump the farmers request irrigation from the supervisor then water was delivered to the different plots usually every eight days in an order from upstream to downstream which requires communication within the group of irrigators as pointed out by the local authority of the ejido manuel ávila camacho we take out the list and the control of the water turns for example i finish and another producer takes it we are getting used to it we have a whatsapp group and we communicate through whatsapp manuel ávila camacho 01 male 52 yrs may 2021 although the forms of water distribution vary in the study areas sometimes with the presence of smaller organizations within the institution communities the ejidos constitute an indispensable level of organization as they act as a link that allows for a better connection between the irrigators and the bureaucratic administration of the irrigation district especially during the monthly assembly or during water distribution activities figs 4 and 5 as with the decision making processes regarding community affairs irrigation water management is discussed at the monthly ejido assembly allowing farmers to establish the main points developed at the irrigation module assembly until the mid 2010 s the three irrigation system sections received water daily however since then recurrent water shortage problems within the irrigation district have forced the management board to ration the resource thus during dry periods each section receives water only two days out of three as farmers share water locally this implies less frequent water turns every 3 4 days for micro sprinklers irrigation and every 12 15 days for flood irrigation due to the decreasing water availability from the irrigation district many farmers have chosen to tap groundwater for example 28 of the la libertad farmers interviewed invested in private wells while the banana associations invested in collective wells however due to the ocean s proximity the two wells of the miguel alemán ejido could never be exploited because of the excessive salinity of the water fig 6 shows the perception of water scarcity in the four ejidos the kruskal wallis test shows that there is no significant difference in the perception of water scarcity among the four ejidos despite their differences in biophysical characteristics such as location irrigation technique or access to groundwater 5 3 how do farmers perceive the irrigation management performance of the wua and their ejido fig 7 shows the degree of satisfaction of farmers with the level of services provided by the wua these services refer to the supervisors role in water delivery equity in water distribution the role of the wua board of directors maintenance of irrigation infrastructure and conflict resolution the kruskal wallis test shows that only the equity in water distribution variable presents a difference related to the ejidos p 024 especially between farmers in ignacio lópez rayón and those in la libertad p 035 moreover the results show that farmers in ignacio lópez rayón are more satisfied average of the five variables than those in la libertad p 032 forty four percent of the farmers in la libertad claim to be very dissatisfied with the equity of water distribution for them the large landowners upstream of their farms monopolize the irrigation water as this farmer points out i have one hectare and he has 130 and he sends us what he has left over if he wants la libertad 15 male 43 yrs apr 2021 some denounce the corrupt practices of the irrigation supervisors who are said to be paid by the large landowners to give them more water this situation explains why they are less satisfied with the role of the supervisors than other ejidos problems of water sharing are sometimes the cause of tensions between farmers but also between ejidos for example the local authorities of the ejido of miguel alemán have denounced the use of water by the farmers of la libertad when it comes to important conflicts such as those between la libertad farmers and large landowners the issue is brought to the wua however only 47 of farmers say they are satisfied with the resolution of conflicts over water which can be particularly violent at times thirty percent of farmers say they are not satisfied with the maintenance of the infrastructure which has been severely degraded since hurricane stan hit in 2005 indeed during this event the water intake of the irrigation system was damaged by floods and the deposit of sediments in the suchiate international river finally only 43 of the farmers claim to be satisfied and very satisfied with the wua board of directors farmers feel that maintenance or water distribution services need to improve as they pay a monthly fee fig 8 shows the perceived compliance with different rules within the ejidos these rules refer to compliance with water turns rational resource management payment of fees maintenance of irrigation canals and attendance at annual wua meetings the kruskal wallis test reveals that these five variables differed significantly according to the ejidos in general farmers in miguel alemán perceive better water management performance average of the 5 variables at the local level than those in la libertad p 000 as the posthoc analysis with bonferroni correction shows this difference is statistically significant for payment of fees p 000 participation in meetings p 000 water turns p 007 rationalization of water use p 005 and canal maintenance p 004 to a lesser extent the result shows a significance difference in the perceived of compliance with water management rules between the ejidos miguel alemán and manuel ávila camacho p 026 this difference is statistically significant for the water turns p 002 the payment of fees is the most complied rule by farmers for them it is the basis for access to water in the case of banana producer associations these fees are paid directly by the association in the case of farmers who irrigate by flooding they must provide proof of payment in order to request water turns each week which obliges them to comply with this payment however payment problems are more significant for farmers who irrigate with micro sprinklers as supervisors cannot suspend distribution to the entire group if some do not pay thus there are many cases of opportunistic behavior especially among farmers in la libertad due to the size of the group seventy nine percent of the farmers of miguel alemán perceive it important and very important to comply with the water turns which the engineers of the banana association establish on the other hand the la libertad and manuel ávila camacho farmers consider that the water turns are not always well complied with non compliance with turns is common among farmers who irrigate by flooding as water is supplied to the different plots in an upstream downstream order however some upstream farmers do not comply with the time allotted or steal the water turn in the case of the la libertad farmers who irrigate with micro sprinklers the problem of water sharing is rather related to the high number of farmers which implies organizational difficulties non compliance with water turns is now the main cause of conflict within ejidos while conflicts can sometimes be violent and require the intervention of the board of directors of the wua most are usually resolved at the local level by the community authorities or the person in charge of controlling the water turns sometimes some problems arise but they are solved the comisariado gives us other alternatives look do not bother it has a solution manuel ávila camacho 05 male 35 yrs may 2021 sixty percent of farmers consider that canal maintenance activities are complied or highly complied this participation implies a renewal of rights and obligations as community members and water users to maintain their systems and have optimal canals for irrigation as this farmer points out if you do not do it you are sanctioned they stop the water until you go and clean your canal that corresponds to you it is more than nothing la libertad 12 male 42 yrs apr 2021 generally canal cleaning begins during the rainy season when irrigation use is no longer required the irrigation supervisor informs the farmers to discuss when the cleaning should start and when the users should hand over the cleaned canals finally fifty four percent of the farmers consider that attendance at the annual meeting is complied or very complied while this perception is very strong among miguel alemán the farmers of la libertad consider that few of them participate in this event fig 9 shows the comparison between the perception of irrigation management performance of the wua and the perception of irrigation management performance within each ejido although fig 9 shows that the values of the dimensions satisfaction with the wua and compliance with the rules are relatively similar within the ejidos of manuel ávila camacho ignacio lópez rayón and la libertad the pearson test shows that there is a significant correlation only for the farmers taken individually of the ejido manuel ávila camacho p 032 this means that there is a relationship between the satisfaction of farmers in this ejido with the services provided by the wua and their perception of the performance of irrigation management at the community level for farmers in miguel alemán this correlation is not significant 6 discussion 6 1 the role of community based water management institutions in the mexican irrigation districts since the 1980 s the imt has been a central element of institutional and economic reforms in the irrigation sector across the globe particularly in developing countries vermillion 1997 senanayake et al 2015 unlike the self management of small scale irrigation systems where the irrigators operate the system the transfer of management to mexican irrigation district users followed the path of bureaucratic management hunt 1989 johnson 1997 salas and wilson 2004 palerm viqueira 2014 while this management model consisted of an operation entirely in the hands of contracted agents with a unified command palerm viqueira 2014 this study has highlighted the role of community institutions linking the irrigator to the administration in charge of water management following the work of cox 2014 and dell angelo et al 2014 we consider that multilevel institutional arrangements that integrate elements of governance at the local level would produce more robust governance systems mirroring several empirical studies we have shown that these institutions are fundamental to water management within mexican irrigation districts as they allow for water distribution tailored to the local requirements and conditions of each ejido montés de oca hernández et al 2012 romero lópez and palerm viquiera 2018 palerm viqueira 2020 furthermore these community institutions play a role in resolving conflicts at the local level which avoids involving and saturating the wua palerm viqueira 2020 in light of these empirical studies and our results we consider the role of community institutions as one of the factors in the successful transfer of mexican irrigation systems to users indeed several studies point out that the wuas demonstrated their ability to manage even the largest modules could be considered a sign of success johnson 1997 rap 2006 however these studies do not address the role of community institutions other studies have attributed the success of the imt to the economic model of the dynamic and commercialized provinces of the north northwest and northeast of the country where agriculture and agribusiness are a mainstay of the local economy garces restrepo 2001 salas and wilson 2004 senanayake et al 2015 however our case study located in the southernmost and poorest area of mexico shows the capacity for self management of the irrigation district especially through community institutions this result also shows that beyond the opposition between large scale infrastructure based development strategies big is beautiful and small scale development strategies at the village or community level small is beautiful see for example adams 1990 smith 2018 there is an alternative model that reconciles both this study thus suggests that bureaucratic management within large scale irrigation systems does not necessarily mean the end of local knowledge systems while this study highlights the role of community institutions in water management in irrigation districts it was essential to explore how farmers perceive performance regarding the level of services provided by the wua before being managed by community institutions access to the resource is determined by bureaucratic management which is responsible for water distribution and infrastructure maintenance at the module 1 irrigation district level the results show that farmers satisfaction with the level of wua service provision varies among the ejidos studied for example it is higher in the ejido ignacio lópez rayón and lower in the ejido la libertad it is possible that the satisfaction of farmers in the ejido ignacio lópez rayón is related to the advantageous position of the community at the beginning of section 2 of the irrigation system and directly on the central canal this allows in the first place to have easier access to the resource than for example the farmers of la libertad which is located downstream of a secondary canal for this reason the farmers of ignacio lópez rayón are relatively satisfied with the work of the irrigation supervisor and perceive a fair distribution of the resource in addition since the central canal infrastructure is the best maintained by the district farmers are also more satisfied with maintenance activities in the case of farmers in la libertad conflicts related to large landowners cause low satisfaction with the fairness of water distribution the work of the supervisor who is often accused of corruption and the resolution of conflicts however the results show that there is no relationship between farmers satisfaction with the wua service provision and the perception of compliance with water management rules in the ejidos the ignacio lópez rayón la libertad and miguel alemán this shows that these farmers do not perceive a correlation between the two main organizational levels of the irrigation district unlike the farmers in manuel ávila camacho one of the reasons for the results obtained in this ejido may be related to the sharing of water by flooding which implies the presence of the irrigation district supervisor in the definition of water turns the fact of using only this method of irrigation la libertad uses it partially therefore entails a closer relationship with the district unlike the other ejidos that have engineers or representatives for water sharing finally the case of farmers in miguel alemán shows that highly organized farmers can perceive better performance at the local level regardless of bureaucratic management several physical and social factors can explain this perceived performance 6 2 how do physical and social factors influence the institutional performance of irrigation management the results suggest a link between community characteristics and institutional performance of irrigation management fig 10 for example the ejido miguel alemán characterized by a small group membership in a single association and high social capital shows the best institutional irrigation performance at the local level in contrast the ejido la libertad characterized by a large group the absence of a farmers association and low social capital has the lowest institutional performance of irrigation management thus the study suggests that farmers membership in an association is a central element of social capital indeed farmers in miguel alemán who are united around a single association are characterized by strong social ties trusting relationships and high participation in collective activities these different dimensions of social capital promote greater compliance with irrigation rules similar to several studies this result confirms a clear link between social capital and successful collective irrigation management pretty 2003 ostrom et al 2003 meinzen dick et al 2007 chai and zeng 2018 aoyagi et al 2022 leroy et al 2022 the case of the la libertad ejido farmers which includes the largest number of irrigators in the irrigation district 201 irrigators and is characterized by distribution problems and recurrent conflicts provides evidence that group size influences irrigation management performance this result is consistent with several works that point out that it is more difficult for large organizations to collaborate bardhan 2000 meinzen dick et al 2002 fujiie et al 2005 araral 2009 takayama et al 2018 one might even be tempted to argue that group size affects social capital which affects cooperation however beyond social factors the study mounts that it is also important to consider biophysical attributes araral 2013 wang et al 2013 for example although small group sizes 35 irrigators characterize the farmers of manuel ávila camacho these farmers experience difficulties in sharing water turns especially due to the practice of flood irrigation which more easily implies opportunistic behavior this result is in line with gorton et al 2009 who found in their study in macedonia that performance is significantly lower when using flood irrigation than when using sprinklers the result also illustrates that the ejido of la libertad with an increasing number of groundwater wells has shown a lower performance however according to the farmers this dynamic is primarily related to the decrease in the amount of water during the dry season problems of equity in water distribution and the high number of farmers thus groundwater exploitation may be more a consequence of poor institutional irrigation performance within the ejido finally the case of miguel alemán suggests that the community s location at the tail end of the irrigation system is also a factor that can influence irrigation performance lam 1998 anderies et al 2013 ricks 2016 soliman et al 2021 indeed when water becomes scarce during the dry season resource distribution operations coordination is essential to irrigate all plots however since engineers manage water distribution is more manageable than if it had to be done by all farmers while the study suggests that physical factors such as location irrigation technique or access to groundwater influence the performance of irrigation management the results show that these characteristics do not influence the perception of water scarcity which is relatively similar within the four ejidos however the perception of water scarcity is not only related to the biophysical conditions of the resource but also to the social factors of its management i e how water is delivered allocated and used fan et al 2019 this may explain why miguel alemán farmers who are at the end of the irrigation system and do not have access to groundwater do not perceive as much water scarcity due to the institutional performance of their ejido s irrigation management however it is complex and artificial to determine which community attributes and biophysical attributes have the most significant impact on the institutional performance of irrigation management instead it is the combination of these factors that influence performance for example the results show that irrigation performance is higher in the miguel alemán ejido due to the characteristics of the group small scale community presence of farmers association social capital and the characteristics of the resource micro sprinklers irrigation position at the tail end of the system and no access to groundwater on the other hand it is weaker in the ejido la libertad due to the high number of farmers and low social capital implying a lack of organization that can push farmers to exploit groundwater 7 conclusions and policy implications this study provides empirical evidence on community institutions role importance and performance in large scale irrigation systems with non governmental bureaucratic administration we have shown that these community institutions are essential as they allow water to be provided to individual irrigators from a resource the bureaucracy provides moreover these institutions play a role in resolving conflicts at the local level which avoids involving and saturating the hierarchical levels of the wua thus the role of this community institution is to act as a link that allows a better connection between farmers and the wua however although all four communities use water from the same irrigation district the results show that the institutional performance of irrigation management within ejidos varies considerably using the iad framework developed by ostrom 2005 we showed that these differences could be explained by the biophysical attributes involved in irrigation irrigation technique access to groundwater resources location of the water intake and community characteristics social capital and group size among these factors the results show that social capital plays a fundamental role as shown by the case of miguel alemán ejido which is united around a single association of producers therefore the study recommends that water and resource managers involve ejidos in creating farmer associations which could increase their social capital market access and local irrigation performance in addition the problems of compliance with water turn among farmers who irrigate by flooding especially in manuel ávila camacho show the necessity of adopting micro sprinklers irrigation if this technology is much more water efficient the results show that it also implies a better water management organization at the local level finally the low satisfaction of farmers with wua service provision particularly in la libertad points to the need for a more equitable distribution of the resource within the irrigation district and a better conflict resolution system in conclusion farmers views on the institutional performance of irrigation management should receive more attention in the large scale irrigation system with bureaucratic administration this knowledge can be particularly useful to improve the different levels of organization and thus water governance of irrigation districts in mexico funding this study was funded by the universidad nacional autónoma de méxico programa deapoyo a proyectos

9161,concerns about hydrological drought risk and irrigation water supply reliability have grown in recent years due to the increasing demand for water for irrigation and other uses and the decline in water availability due to climate change hydrological drought insurance hedging against water supply gaps can be a key instrument for adapting irrigated agriculture to this new scenario since it improves the resilience of the irrigation sector which is having to cope with increasing uncertainty and vulnerability the objective of this paper is to assess farmers willingness to pay wtp for index based hydrological drought insurance under different policy designs considering several different amounts of insured capital insurance deductibles and contract terms to that end it uses a discrete choice experiment as the valuation method and the sector bxii irrigation district southern spain as a case study the results show that farmers would be willing to pay for the proposed hydrological drought insurance stating a higher preference for policy designs with lower amounts of insured capital lower deductibles and shorter contract terms moreover the results also show the existence of heterogeneity among farmers preferences depending on their socio economic characteristics finally we compare the distribution of farmers wtp for different policy design options of the proposed insurance with the commercial premium estimated using actuarial analysis the comparison confirms that only the options with lower levels of insured capital present a mean wtp below the commercial premium while the rest of the policy design options would need to be subsidized like other agricultural insurance schemes to make them attractive to most farmers keywords irrigation water supply drought risk agricultural insurance choice experiment spain data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction irrigated agriculture is exposed to multiple production risks notable among them are those related to hydrological droughts i e below normal instream flows and reservoir levels involving irrigation water supply gaps ronco et al 2017 under these climate events irrigators cannot fully satisfy their crop water needs leading to significant losses for individual farmers production and income as well as problems for society as a whole drops in wealth generation and rural employment and water theft exacerbating the overexploitation of water bodies oecd 2016 in recent years concerns about hydrological drought risk and irrigation water supply reliability have grown especially in mediterranean climate agricultural regions the first explanation for this is the increasing demand for water for irrigation and other uses e g tourism aggravating the scarcity of water resources and making irrigated agriculture currently the predominant use of water more vulnerable to drought garcía ruiz et al 2011 the second reason is climate change its impact on these regions is reflected in the progressive decline in rainfall lower water availability gradual increase in temperatures higher crop water needs and greater frequency and intensity of drought periods all of which lead to a less reliable irrigation water supply garrote et al 2015 bisselink et al 2018 the heightened awareness of water supply gaps explains a widespread interest among farmers in reducing the uncertainty associated with their irrigation water allotments i e the corresponding uncertainty in farmers income in fact several studies e g rigby et al 2010 mesa jurado et al 2012 alcón et al 2014 guerrero baena et al 2019 have found that irrigators show a significant willingness to pay to reduce this uncertainty this evidences the need for new management instruments to cope with hydrological droughts risk in irrigated agriculture garrido and gómez ramos 2009 oecd 2016 among the alternative instruments suggested to date drought insurance has been pointed out as one of the most promising for this purpose rey et al 2018 guerrero baena and gómez limón 2019 indeed drought insurance is viewed as a key instrument for adapting irrigated agriculture to climate change since it improves the resilience of the irrigation sector which is having to cope with increasing uncertainty and vulnerability due to changing global conditions garrido et al 2012 varela ortega et al 2016 although agricultural insurance is widely used in developed countries meuwissen et al 2018 the risk of hydrological droughts in irrigated agriculture is not covered anywhere multiple factors that hinder the development of this kind of insurance scheme for a detailed explanation see guerrero baena and gómez limón 2019 explain why irrigators cannot take out insurance policies to protect themselves against financial losses resulting from water supply gaps however recent literature has suggested the implementation of index based hydrological drought insurance schemes i e where indemnities are calculated according to the value of an objective and non manipulable index correlated with the losses caused by the water supply gaps as a suitable option to minimize the key problems related to this kind of schemes such as moral hazard adverse selection and high administrative costs for in field damage evaluations or conflict resolution jensen and barrett 2017 1 1 however other major drawbacks affecting hydrological drought insurance remain unresolved in index based schemes such as considering droughts as a systemic risk and the uncertain performance of this insurance due to climate change both features involve a higher cost of reinsurance and thus give rise to affordability issues the proposals developed by zeuli and skees 2005 brown and carriquiry 2007 leiva and skees 2008 buchholz and musshoff 2014 maestro et al 2016 or guerrero baena and gómez limón 2019 are good examples of this kind of insurance scheme tailored to irrigated agriculture sectors worldwide nevertheless implementing the proposed insurance schemes in a real life setting requires additional empirical studies both from supply side and demand side perspectives studies based on the former approach are needed to calculate the commercial premiums that ensure the schemes under analysis are profitable for the insurance firm i e the aggregate revenues from the premiums collected are higher than the sum of the aggregate expected indemnities and other related management costs meanwhile demand side studies are needed to assess irrigators willingness to pay wtp for the insurance policies proposed the commercial viability of the proposed schemes can only be confirmed by comparing the results of both kinds of studies only when a significant share of potential insurees reports a wtp for the insurance policies proposed that exceeds the commercial premium demanded by the insurance firms can the insurance scheme under analysis be considered ready for implementation to date however most drought insurance studies have focused on the supply side i e the cost of the policy examples include the papers by pérez blanco and gómez 2013 2014 maestro et al 2016 and gómez limón 2020 of the small number of drought insurance studies that assess the demand side e g leiva and skees 2008 buchholz and musshoff 2014 only a few actually assess farmers wtp for this kind of insurance policy examples of such studies are the ones by quiroga et al 2011 who estimated farmers wtp for hydrological drought insurance as a percentage of the crop yield for the case of corn growers in spain and rey et al 2016 who assessed the wtp for this kind of insurance depending on farmers risk aversion levels in the segura basin southeastern spain in this sense this paper aims to contribute to the development of hydrological drought insurance schemes by implementing a new demand side analysis assessing the irrigators wtp for different policy designs possible for this kind of insurance most studies assessing farmers wtp for taking out an insurance policy have relied on the expected utility theory eut as the dominant paradigm explaining decision making under uncertainty following the eut farmers decisions have been modeled using a von neumann morgenstern utility function that allows the calculation of the certainty equivalent for any risky situation that is the guaranteed amount of money that the individuals would accept now rather than taking a chance on a higher but uncertain return in the future thus farmers wtp for taking out insurance policies has been calculated by comparing the sums of money characterizing the insured scenarios if they take out the policy and the uninsured scenarios if they do not in certainty equivalent terms the difference between these scenarios is always positive for risk averse farmers and is considered their maximum wtp for taking out the insurance a relevant example of the implementation of this approach can be found in the study by pérez blanco et al 2016 who explicitly calculated farmers wtp for farm income insurance considering different deductible values in a drought prone area in southeastern spain however recent evidence shows that farmers decisions about taking out insurance are not generally consistent with expected utility maximization assuming that farmers are risk averse and subsidized premiums are set below actuarially fair levels the eut rationale holds that all farmers should buy the highest level of coverage possible so long as subsidies are maximized at this level however du et al 2016 showed empirical evidence contradicting this theoretical inference and demonstrated that the probability of taking out an insurance product declines as the premiums increase even though higher values of these expenditures increase farmers expected utility similar conclusions that decisions about taking out insurance are generally not consistent with expected utility maximization have been reported by babcock 2015 and carter et al 2015 who suggested the prospect theory pt as an alternative theoretical framework to better understand farmers insurance decisions this calls for the use of other valuation techniques that are not based on stringent assumptions regarding the shape of farmers utility functions such as those imposed by the eut or the pt possible options include techniques based on stated preferences such as the contingent valuation method cvm or the choice experiment ce although these methods have already been used to analyze the demand for other types of agricultural insurance e g liesivaara and myyrä 2017 doherty et al 2021 they have not yet been applied to assess irrigators wtp for taking out hydrological drought insurance policies within this context the first objective of this paper is to assess irrigators wtp for index based hydrological drought insurance under different policy designs considering several amounts of insured capital insurance deductibles and contract terms for this purpose the index based hydrological drought insurance scheme proposed by guerrero baena and gómez limón 2019 is considered for implementation in a real world setting using ce as the valuation technique this objective is achieved empirically by providing a quantitative example in the guadalquivir river basin southern spain the results from this valuation exercise will illustrate the heterogeneity of irrigators preferences regarding hydrological drought insurance and thus the potential insurance adoption rate depending on the potential insurance premiums established for taking out these policies moreover it is worth pointing out that the second objective of this paper is to compare the demand side results obtained here with the supply side results reported by gómez limón 2020 who used actuarial analysis to calculate commercial premiums for this hydrological drought insurance scheme in the same irrigation district considered in this paper as a case study matching these two studies will allow an exploration of the commercial viability of the insurance scheme proposed the achievement of these two objectives will contribute to the existing literature by providing further insights into how to fine tune drought insurance policies supporting efficient decision making regarding the most suitable design for this agricultural insurance scheme in so doing this study aims to be useful for further developing a risk management instrument that can act as a buffer against the microeconomic effects of water supply gaps due to hydrological droughts ultimately the goal is to help improve the economic social and environmental performance of irrigated agriculture while guaranteeing its resilience in the face of global change 2 case study 2 1 the sector bxii irrigation district the sector bxii sbxii is an irrigation district covering 14 673 ha located on the left bank of the guadalquivir river southern spain near its mouth into the atlantic ocean this area was converted to irrigation during the 1980 s as its mediterranean climate mild wet winters and warm dry summers makes this district suitable for irrigated agriculture in any case the irrigation infrastructure and techniques have since been updated nowadays the sbxii is a valuable example of modern highly profitable irrigated agriculture production the sbxii is operated by 569 farmers average farm size of 25 8 ha who are organized into a water user association see www crsectorb12 es this association holds the collective right to 6000 cubic meters of water per hectare and year full water allotment granted by the river basin agency confederación hidrográfica del guadalquivir chg the association manages the distribution of the water among all its irrigators to which end it uses a fully modernized pressurized pipe network that allows for an on demand irrigation system the main crops currently grown in the district are cotton 45 of the total area tomato 22 other vegetables such as onions peppers and carrots 14 sugar beet 7 and cereals corn wheat and quinoa accounting for 6 these crops are mainly irrigated by sprinkler irrigation 71 of the total area although drip 28 and surface irrigation 1 techniques are also used depending on the crop nevertheless it is worth noting that there is wide heterogeneity in terms of productive profiles at the farm level with these profiles being based on both productive features size and crop mixes and farmers socio demographic characteristics age and educational level the main problem faced by irrigators in the sbxii is their vulnerability to water supply gaps i e water shortages during hydrological drought periods like most of the irrigation districts in the guadalquivir river basin grb the only source of water for the farmers in the sbxii is the supply of surface water provided annually by the chg annual water allocations in normal hydrological years when all water rights can be satisfied with the water stored in the reservoirs the chg allows the irrigators in the sbxii to use up to 6000 m3 ha annual water allocations equal to the full water allotment a volume that fully meets farmers water needs however this is not always the case the grb is characterized by a typical mediterranean climate with an average annual rainfall of 573 mm but this precipitation is rather heterogeneous across years leading to frequent hydrological drought events in these drought years when aggregate water availability i e water stored in the grb reservoir network is lower than aggregate full water allotments the chg has to ration water supply to irrigation districts following the proportional rule as established in the drought management plan chg 2018 considering current demand and supply constraints and the institutional framework set out in the guadalquivir river basin management plan chg 2015 the distribution of the annual water allocations for the case study irrigation district is shown in the histogram in fig 1 under hydrological drought circumstances annual water allocations provided by the chg are not enough to fully meet farmers water needs moreover since there is no possibility of alternative water sources in this irrigation district e g groundwater extracted from wells irrigators in the sbxii cannot reduce their vulnerability to hydrological drought thus when there are water supply gaps they have to adapt crop water needs to the lower water availability e g reducing the area actually irrigated these cuts in water allocations involve significant income losses for all these farmers that said the resulting losses differ notably among irrigators with much greater losses hitting more intensive farming i e those farmers specialized in high value crops such as tomato or other vegetables moreover it is worth noting that cyclical water shortages in the sbxii irrigation district are becoming more frequent and intense because of climate change bisselink et al 2018 therefore the already high and increasing vulnerability to irrigation water supply gaps evidences the need for hydrological drought insurance as a new management instrument to cope with this risk justifying the choice of this case study for the empirical analysis proposed here based on official statistics and data provided by local technicians a study on the profitability income and expenses of the crops grown in this irrigation district was carried out the information collected shows that all crops in the sbxii are cultivated similarly throughout the study area with a similar profit structure table 1 shows the average data regarding the profitability and the water needs for the main crops the characterization of irrigated farms in the sbxii was carried out by means of a survey conducted specifically for this study for this survey a representative sample n 202 of farmers in the study area n 569 was drawn individuals were randomly selected accounting for farm size quotas questionnaires were completed through face to face interviews between february and march 2022 with interviewers collecting data on a farm structure size land ownership labor b crop mix c irrigation systems d water management e farmers socio demographic characteristics age gender education household income f farmers opinion about previous experience with agricultural insurance and g the implementation of the valuation method used see section 3 the main characteristics of the farms and farmers sampled are reported in table 2 data gathered from irrigators show heterogeneity among farms in terms of crop mixes and thus profitability this means the capital to be insured by the proposed hydrological drought insurance should also be heterogeneous as explained in the following sections 2 2 the hydrological drought insurance in this section the index based hydrological drought insurance scheme proposed by guerrero baena and gómez limón 2019 and gómez limón 2020 is summarized pointing out the different design options worth considering for assessing irrigators demand for this kind of insurance the proposed hydrological drought insurance aims to protect the insured farmers against losses from irrigation water supply gaps thus the first key attribute of the insurance to be defined is how to calculate the insured capital ic as in any other mediterranean climate irrigated area agricultural operations in the sbxii usually begin in fall or winter depending on the crop with farmers preparing the soil for sowing taking advantage of the existing soil moisture from rainfall during the wet season fall and winter thus crops are grown throughout the spring and summer and harvested in early fall irrigation operations usually start in may at the beginning of the dry season late spring and summer under this agricultural calendar crop mix decisions are taken by farmers at the beginning of the agricultural year fall or winter however these decisions are made under uncertainty since information about water allocations for irrigation is not available until may 1st when the chg sets annual water allocations depending on the water stored in the reservoirs at the end of the wet season by may 1st when water allocation decisions are known irrigators in the sbxii have little leeway to cope with any water supply gap in fact the only option they have for dealing with the water constraints is to stop irrigating and cultivating a share or the whole of their irrigable land and leave it fallow gómez limón 2020 under these circumstances the insured capital could be defined considering three alternatives 1 the sum of all variable costs already spent on the irrigated crops by may 1st ic1 with this insured capital the indemnity received by the farmers would compensate only the working capital invested in the irrigated crops until may 1st when a share or the whole irrigated area would be left fallow 2 the aggregate expected gross margin income minus variable costs considering full water allotment ic2 this definition of the insured capital involves payment of indemnities to compensate farmers for the profit proxied by the aggregate gross margin foregone due to irrigation supply gaps thus it would partially compensate farmers for the losses in expected income i e under full irrigation water allotment circumstances since they would bear the costs of the working capital invested until may 1st in the crops that they have to stop irrigating because of water allocation gaps 3 the aggregate expected gross margin considering full water allotment plus the sum of all variable costs by may 1st ic3 this definition of the insured capital involves payment of an indemnity to cover both the profit foregone and the investment in working capital this is the only definition of the insured capital that actually guarantees the farmers income remains fully stable despite water supply gaps the several alternative amounts of insured capital can be easily estimated on a farm by farm basis by accounting for their crop mix and the average variable costs and gross margins for each irrigated crop within the irrigation district see table 1 considering the three abovementioned levels ic1 ic2 and ic3 allows us to analyze the role of the amount of the insured capital in farmers wtp for the proposed insurance and check for the possible existence of non linear relations between the two variables this analysis would be useful for informing the final design of the policy to be offered in any case it is assumed that once the final policy has been designed i e with just one option for the insured capital farmers would not be given a choice about the amount of capital to insure table 3 illustrates the heterogeneity in the amounts of insured capital showing the calculations considering the crop mixes of three farm types a average farm type based on the average crop mix in the sbxii b high value farm type based on a crop mix of 50 tomato and 50 other vegetables peppers and onion and c low value farm type based on a crop mix of 50 cotton and 50 sugar beet for the insurance proposed the occurrence of a loss is verified when the annual water allocation set by the chg is lower than the full water allotment in order to calculate these losses in a similar way for all insured farms it is assumed that farmers behave rationally as profit maximizers when choosing which crops to stop irrigating and that they therefore progressively abandon those with the lowest water productivity 2 2 there is ample evidence that farmers decision making can be more accurately simulated under the assumption that they are utility maximizers accounting for profit within non linear utility functions e g eut or pt or assuming multi attribute utility functions maufs i e those considering profit and other attributes such as risk or management complexity however it is worth explaining that assessing the losses in real life agricultural insurance schemes requires a simple i e easy to understand method that is similarly applied to all farmers i e regardless of the utility function they considered this justifies the use of the profit maximization assumption as the criterion for switching from cultivation to fallow since a it is the most widespread strategy to cope with hydrological drought events b it is easy to understand for all farmers and c it leads to reasonable approximations of the losses experienced by farmers during droughts this assumption lets us estimate the crop mixes for any annual water allocation lower than full water allotment thus enabling the calculation of the losses depending on the chosen insured capital that is based on the difference between the scenario with full water allotments and the scenario with the reduced annual water allocations i e only considering the crop area that can be actually irrigated in index based insurance losses and indemnities are calculated according to an objective and non manipulable index value in the case of the proposed hydrological drought insurance the most suitable index value is the amount of water stored in the reservoir network at the beginning of the irrigation season ws may 1 st measured as a percentage of the total storage capacity of the network guerrero baena and gómez limón 2019 every year once the value of ws may 1 st and the existing drought situation normality pre alert alert or emergency are known the chg sets the annual water allocations for irrigation following the guidelines established in the drought management plan chg 2018 considering this allocation rule losses caused by hydrological droughts can be estimated for insurance purposes as a function of the water stored on may 1st as follows 1 loss f ws may 1 st the indemnity i is the cash amount that the insurance company pays insured farmers which is equivalent to the value of the loss minus the deductible ded agreed in the policy i e the percentage of the insured capital that the farmer is responsible for covering in the case of the index based insurance scheme proposed the indemnity can be calculated after determining the value of the ws may 1 st index using the following expression gómez limón 2020 2 i 0 if 0 h w s m a y 1 s t d e d i c no loss h w s m a y 1 s t d e d i c if d e d i c h w s m a y 1 s t no loss i c 1 d e d if h w s m a y 1 s t i c total loss for analytical purposes different deductible ded levels have been considered for the demand assessment 0 10 20 and 30 this allows us to explore the relationship between the value of the deductible and farmers wtp for the proposed insurance and supports the final design of the policies that will eventually be commercially available 3 3 a 0 deductible would not be suitable for a commercial insurance policy because it goes against the principle of risk sharing between the insurer and the insuree and would involve unaffordable premiums however a zero deductible has been considered for scientific exploratory purposes since it allows us to isolate the effect of other attributes and to better analyze the relationship between the deductible and farmers wtp for the proposed insurance the proposed hydrological drought insurance is based on annual policies these policies should be formalized by paying the annual premium in september every year these contracts would be valid from the purchase of the policy to may 1st the following year when the ws may 1 st index is calculated and if losses have occurred indemnities can be claimed however it is worth pointing out that during the contracting period the potential insurees have information about the volume of water stored in the reservoir network at the beginning of the hydrological year october 1st potentially leading to some intertemporal adverse selection in order to minimize this problem which would jeopardize the viability of the insurance scheme the condition should be established that if a pre alert alert or emergency situation is declared during the contracting period september the proposed insurance can only be taken out by those who had drought insurance the previous year furthermore farmers who wish to take out a policy for the first time could also be required to sign a commitment that they will renew their policies for the next three or five years thus three different contract terms for new insurees have been considered for the demand assessment one year 4 4 as in the case of the 0 deductible a one year contract would not be suitable for a commercial insurance policy due to adverse selection issues however as in the previous case it is included for scientific exploratory purposes three years and five years 3 valuation method 3 1 choice modeling approach attributes levels and experimental design to analyze farmers preferences for taking out the proposed hydrological drought insurance a hypothetical market has been created using the stated preference method of the discrete choice experiment dce as the valuation method this method is based on lancaster s consumer theory lancaster 1966 and random utility theory mcfadden 1974 and has been previously used in the assessment of farmers preferences toward insurance policies e g aizaki et al 2021 doherty et al 2021 fu et al 2022 a detailed description of this valuation method can be consulted in hensher et al 2015 four attributes were selected to implement the dce method three non monetary and one monetary see table 4 with regard to the non monetary attributes the selected attributes correspond to the main characteristics of the hydrological drought insurance described in the previous section these are a the insured capital with three levels corresponding to the sum of variable costs until may 1st the aggregate gross margin considering full water allotments and the sum of variable costs until may 1st plus the aggregate gross margin considering full water allotments b the deductible with four levels 0 10 20 and 30 and c the contract term with three levels 1 3 and 5 years with regard to the monetary attribute it consists of the premium of the insurance defined as a percentage of the insured capital with six levels ranging from 2 to 12 the levels of the monetary attribute were based on the actuarial analysis carried out by gómez limón 2020 an efficient design minimizing the d error using bayesian techniques rose et al 2011 was employed for the experimental design due to the lack of prior information the priors for all the attributes were set close to zero with a negative sign except for the insured capital which was set at zero due to the uncertainty associated with the behavior of the farmers with respect to it 5 5 this attribute involves two opposite effects which combined could positively or negatively influence the utility function on the one hand the higher the amount of insured capital the higher the indemnities received by the farmer higher utility on the other hand a larger amount of capital also implies an increase in the premium to be paid lower utility since there is not enough information to indicate which effect would prevail we took the conservative approach of not imposing any sign the efficient design obtained consisted of 32 choice cards distributed in four blocks of eight cards each with a d error of 0 111 for the estimation of the experimental design the ngene 1 2 1 software was used a pilot of 60 interviews was conducted to assure the adequacy of the experimental design where it was found to be satisfactory and was therefore maintained before conducting the dce exercise the interviewed farmers were asked for information on the distribution of crops on the farm which was used to estimate the three possible levels of the farmer s insured capital the choice cards consisted of an insurance option with a combination of the levels of the four attributes and an opt out option no purchase of the proposed insurance to ensure the insurance option proposed in each choice card was readily understandable the cards included an illustrative graph showing the indemnities that the farmer would receive in the event of several reductions of his her annual water allocation these graphs were produced based on individual farmers crop distributions and the characteristics of the insurance option the level of insurance capital and the deductible although defined as a percentage of the insured capital the monetary attribute was shown to the farmer as a premium in euros per hectare ha calculated as the product of the insured capital and the level of the monetary attribute corresponding to the insurance option an example of a choice card is shown in fig 2 although it is recognized that the dce method overcomes most of the limitations related to other stated preference methods hanley et al 1998 it is worth noting that estimations using this valuation approach could be affected by hypothetical bias haghani et al 2021a the presence of this bias when using a dce depends on the type of good public or private the type of measurement wtp or wta and the familiarity or previous experience with the good or service guzman and kolstad 2007 schläpfer and fischhoff 2012 haghani et al 2021a our case study values a private good insurance policies and assesses wtp by farmers who have previous experience with insurance these features have been shown to be among those that are less susceptible to hypothetical bias farmers were given a cheap talk before the start of the dce exercise reminding them their budget was limited and that the money spent on the insurance could not be spent on other expenses on or off the farm interviewed farmers were also reminded that they could opt not to purchase the proposed insurance opt out reminder furthermore a self assessment question regarding perceived consequentiality was included at the end of the valuation exercise to assess whether farmers believed that their answer would actually be considered in the design of the proposed insurance results show that most farmers did perceive consequentiality i e they believed that their answers would be taken into account for the insurance design as evidenced by haghani et al 2021b the implementation of all these strategies minimizes the presence of hypothetical bias increasing the reliability of the estimates obtained following the exercise a question was included for farmers who were not willing to buy any of the offered insurance policies in these cases farmers were asked about the reason s for not taking out any insurance policies distinguishing between protest responses and real zero values from the total of 202 farmers who fully completed the questionnaires seven were considered to be protests reducing the total number of valid questionnaires to 195 3 2 econometric approach to analyze farmers preferences towards the proposed hydrological drought insurance a mixed logit model in wtp space was used the main advantage of these models is that they allow the direct estimation of the wtp of each attribute instead of deriving it from the distribution of utility coefficients which can be difficult or impossible with some choice of parameter distribution daly et al 2012 in addition they provide more reasonable distributions of the wtp train and weeks 2005 the model starts from a conventional specification of the utility function with n individuals t choice cards and j alternatives 1 u njt α n p njt β n χ njt ε where p njt is the insurance premium χ njt is a vector with the rest of the attributes and levels in the choice cards α n and β n are the utility coefficients for the premium and the other attributes respectively including a set of alternative specific constants asc which vary randomly over people and ε is a random term representing all unobserved components of the utility function which is assumed to be i i d type one extreme value and follows a gumbel distribution individuals wtp for the attributes is calculated as the ratio between the utility coefficients of the attribute β n and the premium coefficient α n therefore expression 1 can be reordered as follows 2 u njt α n p njt α n w n χ njt ε where w n is the wtp associated with these attributes as in expression 1 α n and w n are randomly distributed over people w n can be further decomposed in w n w w z z n where w is a vector of individual willingness to pay randomly distributed across the population following a density function f w θ with θ representing the parameters of the distribution and w z z n represents the heterogeneity in the mean of the wtp associated with the attributes and levels with w z being the coefficients to be estimated and z n a vector of individual characteristics the choices are modeled following a panel structure so that the probability integral is composed of a product of logistic formulae this integral does not have a closed form so its solution requires an iterative process train 2003 the model has been estimated using 1000 modified latin hypercube sampling mlhs draws hess et al 2006 assuming a normal distribution in all the parameters for modeling purposes all the attributes except for the premium have been treated as categorical variables thus the econometric model requires fixing one of the levels in each attribute as the base category with the coefficient values of the other levels representing the additional wtp associated with these levels over the base category in our case the lowest level in each attribute has been fixed as the base category that is the sum of variable costs until may 1st for the insured capital 0 for the deductible and one year for the contract term for a more in depth analysis of the heterogeneity of farmers preferences for the proposed hydrological drought insurance interactions of farm and farmers socio economic characteristics with the asc were included the modeling procedure was to include each of the selected variables those shown in table 2 in a single interaction wtp space model to check their significance in a second step all interactions found to be significant were included in a multiple interaction model from this model the least significant interactions were excluded one by one until a fully significant model was obtained all models were estimated with r using the apollo package version 0 2 7 hess and palma 2019 2022 4 results and discussion 4 1 wtp space model the results of the wtp space model are shown in table 5 the model presents a very high goodness of fit adjusted pseudo r2 0 503 in order to interpret these results it is worth clarifying that in a wtp space model all coefficients except those associated with the monetary attribute i e the premium in our case study represent the parameters of the distribution of the marginal wtp for the different attributes the results of the model show that all mean coefficients are highly significant the asc has a positive sign accounting for the average wtp i e a premium equal to 10 36 of the insured capital for the insurance designed with the fixed levels i e base categories mentioned above the premium coefficient also has a positive sign which implies a reduction in utility associated with the increase of the premium to be paid 6 6 as can be seen in expressions 1 and 2 the premium attribute is multiplied by 1 therefore the positive sign implies a negative effect in the utility function in contrast the rest of the attributes have a negative sign which indicates a reduction in the utility i e wtp attached to the insurance when the insured capital the deductible and the contract term are increased it should be recalled that the insurance premium is measured as a percentage of the insured capital therefore an increase in the insured capital implies the same proportional increase in the actual amount of money to be paid by the farmer for taking out the insurance however the higher the insured capital the higher the indemnity in the event of a water allotment shortage in this sense the negative sign obtained for the attribute insured capital indicates that the effect on the amount to be paid prevails over the effect on the indemnities this means that farmers are willing to pay a higher percentage for a lower level of insured capital because this entails a smaller payment although it also implies lower potential indemnities this effect is not appreciable when comparing the two higher levels of insured capital as no significant differences are found between the means of the two coefficients 7 7 the delta method has been used on the difference between the mean coefficients of both levels of insured capital showing that the difference between them is not different from zero this result indicates that farmers would be willing to pay on average the same percentage of their insured capital as an insurance premium if the variable costs on may 1st are added to the aggregate gross margin even though it would increase the payment in euros per hectare in the case of the deductible the higher the deductible the lower the wtp for the insurance this result is to be expected as the increase in the deductible would imply a lower probability of receiving an indemnity in the event of a water shortage i e the water shortage needed to receive an indemnity would be more acute and lower indemnities in every case see also pérez blanco et al 2016 for similar results however it is worth noting that the relationship between farmers wtp and the deductible is not linear the decline in wtp is less between the 30 deductible and the 20 deductible than between 20 and 10 and between 10 and 0 finally regarding the contract term the results show that increasing contract duration represents a disutility for farmers i e lower wtp for the insurance as a longer contract term means they are committed to paying the insurance and reduces their capacity to implement other alternative risk management instruments e g precautionary savings as a self insurance alternative as in the case of the deductible the relation between the contract term and the wtp is not linear the decline is greater for an increase in the contract term from one to three years than from three to five three significant interactions were found between socio economic variables and the asc see table 5 first the interaction between full time farmers and the asc turns out to be negative indicating those farmers have a lower wtp to insure their farms against hydrological droughts this result could be due to these farmers perceiving that they have a higher degree of control over their farm allowing them to better adapt their crop mix and irrigation strategies in cases of water shortage goodwin 1993 another potential explanation is that full time farmers are more likely to implement other alternative risk management instruments to make them less vulnerable to drought events such as diversification mishra et al 2004 on the other hand the interaction with the percentage of cotton on the farm yields a positive result indicating that the higher the presence of this crop on the farm the stronger the farmers preference for the insurance in this regard it should be noted that in the case study area cotton represents a relatively low profit option compared to other alternative crops such as vegetables therefore the insured capital would similarly be lower as a result the actual insurance premium would be lower as the percentage of cotton increases finally the interaction with the coefficient of constant relative risk aversion crra also has a positive coefficient indicating that more risk averse farmers would be more willing to insure their farms this finding is aligned with those reported by jin et al 2016 or zhang et al 2021 although it contrasts with the evidence found by giné et al 2008 or cole et al 2013 in any case the standard deviation coefficients turn out to be significant for most attributes and the asc see table 5 indicating the existence of heterogeneity among farmers preferences with regard to these attributes which has not been captured by the interactions with the mean included in the model the only exceptions are the insured capital when it accounts for the aggregate gross margin of the farm and the 10 deductible therefore further research is needed to explore other sources of heterogeneity in irrigators wtp for the proposed insurance 4 2 wtp for different drought insurance designs table 6 shows the mean wtp for different hydrological drought insurance designs both as the percentage of the insured capital and in euros per hectare considering the case of the average farm in the sbxii shown in table 3 in this table only the designs with significant positive wtp are reported however it is worth noting that there are also alternative mixes with negative mean wtp more specifically those including a high deductible and or an extended contract term e g the alternative combining an insured capital var costs may 1st gross margin a deductible of 30 and a contract term of 5 years they can thus be ruled out as promising policy designs mean wtp for the different hydrological drought insurance considered ranges between 12 77 var costs may 1st 0 deductible 1 year and 2 24 var costs may 1st gross margin 30 deductible 1 year of the insured capital according to the results explained in the previous section it can be seen that the wtp decreases as the insured capital the deductible and the contract term increase mean wtp for the proposed insurance in euros per hectare ranges between 72 58 and 360 80 ha since the expected indemnities increase with the insured capital the premium per hectare that farmers are willing to pay to purchase the insurance is higher for options with higher levels of insured capital i e aggregate expected gross margin and aggregate expected gross margin plus the sum of all variable costs by may 1st however the percentage of the insured capital that farmers are willing to pay for these options is lower than for the lowest level of the insured capital sum of all variable costs by may 1st the only exception is for the option of a deductible of 30 where the estimated mean wtp in euros per hectare for the first level of insured capital variable costs by may 1st is slightly higher than for the second level aggregate expected gross margin although the difference between them is not significant 8 8 tested using the delta method for the difference between the two estimates of mean wtp on the other hand the premiums farmers are willing to pay are lower when the contract term or the deductible increase this reduction is greater for higher levels of insured capital for example for the variable costs by may 1st option increasing the contract term from one to three years yields a reduction in the payment of 33 85 ha while for the aggregate gross margin plus variable costs by may 1st option this reduction is 132 06 ha likewise increasing the deductible from 0 to 30 reduces the wtp by 67 65 ha for the first level of insured capital with a reduction of 263 94 ha for the highest level of insured capital the results pertaining to the deductible are comparable to those reported by liesivaara and myyrä 2014 2017 who also found that increasing the deductible reduces farmers wtp for insurance policies in the case of the contract term doherty et al 2021 found that farmers who had already insured their farms showed higher wtp for longer contract terms while farmers not currently insuring their farms presented lower wtp in such cases given that the proposed hydrological drought insurance is not yet available and farmers have no previous experience with this risk management instrument our finding is aligned with that reported by these authors in any case further research is needed in order to clarify farmers preferences toward longer or shorter contract terms 4 3 probability of taking out the insurance gómez limón 2020 implemented an actuarial analysis aimed at calculating the commercial premiums for the same hydrological drought insurance and irrigated district considered in this paper these premiums are the prices that insurance companies would request to underwrite the different policies of the proposed drought insurance the results found in that study can be seen in the third column of table 7 it should be noted that in the previous study only differences in the insured capital and the deductible were analyzed considering a one year contract term in every case thus only the premium based on one year term policies can be included in the wtp comparison in this paper it is worth noting that while the commercial premium is a deterministic value i e it is the same for all potentially insured farmers the wtp for taking out the insurance is a probabilistic value i e it is distributed among the population of targeted farmers this is shown graphically in fig 3 where the probability of taking out the insurance measured on the horizontal axis is charted for the case of the average farm in the sbxii considering an insurance policy designed with a 10 deductible and one year contract term as can be observed the commercial premiums are represented by horizontal lines depending only on the insured capital while the wtp values are represented by downward sloping lines meaning that the lower the premium the higher the uptake of insurance this chart actually represents the insurance supply i e commercial premium and demand wtp which reach the market equilibrium at their intersection pointing to the probability of taking out the insurance in the example shown in fig 3 these probabilities are 65 5 for the insured capital accounting for variable costs may 1st 1 6 for the insured capital accounting for the gross margin and 3 4 for the insured capital accounting for the variable costs may 1st plus the gross margin according to the probabilities of taking out the insurance shown in the last column of table 7 for every policy design it can be seen that only policy designs considering the variable costs may 1st as insured capital would be commercially successful in all these cases the share of farmers contracting the drought insurance would be above 65 reaching 83 1 when this insured capital is combined with a deductible of 30 other policy designs based on a deductible of 30 could also have commercial potential although with a much more limited potential market share of farmers taking out the drought insurance slightly below 30 the rest of the designs have very low contracting rates and thus insurance firms would have no interest in bringing them to market 5 conclusions the results provide evidence that farmers would be willing to pay for index based hydrological drought insurance showing a higher preference for policy designs with a smaller amount of insured capital i e variable costs until may 1st lower deductible i e 0 and shorter contract term i e one year the novelty of the proposed insurance could explain these results it is plausible that once farmers get used to the insurance they would be more willing to purchase other options involving a larger amount of insured capital higher deductible and longer contract term the results also show the existence of heterogeneity among farmers preferences depending on their socio economic characteristics full time farmers would be more reluctant to purchase the proposed insurance while those with a higher percentage of the farm devoted to cotton the most important crop in the study area and who are more risk averse would pay a higher premium for contracting the insurance furthermore we compared the distribution of farmers wtp for different policy design options of the proposed drought insurance with the commercial premium estimated using actuarial analysis the results show that the options with the insured capital based on variable costs until may 1st are the only ones with a mean wtp lower than the commercial premium i e probability of taking out the insurance above 50 the rest of the policy design options would have to be subsidized as other agricultural insurance schemes are i e a share of the premium would be paid by the public sector to make them attractive to most farmers the evidence above suggests it would be advisable to start implementing the proposed hydrological drought insurance initially only marketing policies in which the insured capital accounts for variable costs incurred until may 1st moreover it is expected that once the farmers have gained some experience with this risk management instrument all the other different policy design options would become more attractive i e the wtp would increase thus reducing the need for public subsidies to make policies with higher levels of insured capital and longer contract terms more appealing finally it is worth noting that this work is not free of methodological limitations the most relevant one affects all valuation exercises based on stated preferences since the lucas critique applies in this case in fact the results reported should be considered simply a snapshot of the case study analyzed at the time the survey was carried out notwithstanding market prices inputs and outputs agricultural policy instruments implemented and water allocation criteria in effect at this time in the sbxii cannot be considered structural characteristics of this irrigation district but are policy variants this means any estimation of farmers wtp for the proposed insurance policies is context specific and does not account for the actual dynamics of farmers preferences depending on changes in the circumstances this limitation calls for new empirical evidence on farmers wtp for hydrological drought insurance in different market agricultural policy or water management frameworks to check the reliability and

9161,concerns about hydrological drought risk and irrigation water supply reliability have grown in recent years due to the increasing demand for water for irrigation and other uses and the decline in water availability due to climate change hydrological drought insurance hedging against water supply gaps can be a key instrument for adapting irrigated agriculture to this new scenario since it improves the resilience of the irrigation sector which is having to cope with increasing uncertainty and vulnerability the objective of this paper is to assess farmers willingness to pay wtp for index based hydrological drought insurance under different policy designs considering several different amounts of insured capital insurance deductibles and contract terms to that end it uses a discrete choice experiment as the valuation method and the sector bxii irrigation district southern spain as a case study the results show that farmers would be willing to pay for the proposed hydrological drought insurance stating a higher preference for policy designs with lower amounts of insured capital lower deductibles and shorter contract terms moreover the results also show the existence of heterogeneity among farmers preferences depending on their socio economic characteristics finally we compare the distribution of farmers wtp for different policy design options of the proposed insurance with the commercial premium estimated using actuarial analysis the comparison confirms that only the options with lower levels of insured capital present a mean wtp below the commercial premium while the rest of the policy design options would need to be subsidized like other agricultural insurance schemes to make them attractive to most farmers keywords irrigation water supply drought risk agricultural insurance choice experiment spain data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction irrigated agriculture is exposed to multiple production risks notable among them are those related to hydrological droughts i e below normal instream flows and reservoir levels involving irrigation water supply gaps ronco et al 2017 under these climate events irrigators cannot fully satisfy their crop water needs leading to significant losses for individual farmers production and income as well as problems for society as a whole drops in wealth generation and rural employment and water theft exacerbating the overexploitation of water bodies oecd 2016 in recent years concerns about hydrological drought risk and irrigation water supply reliability have grown especially in mediterranean climate agricultural regions the first explanation for this is the increasing demand for water for irrigation and other uses e g tourism aggravating the scarcity of water resources and making irrigated agriculture currently the predominant use of water more vulnerable to drought garcía ruiz et al 2011 the second reason is climate change its impact on these regions is reflected in the progressive decline in rainfall lower water availability gradual increase in temperatures higher crop water needs and greater frequency and intensity of drought periods all of which lead to a less reliable irrigation water supply garrote et al 2015 bisselink et al 2018 the heightened awareness of water supply gaps explains a widespread interest among farmers in reducing the uncertainty associated with their irrigation water allotments i e the corresponding uncertainty in farmers income in fact several studies e g rigby et al 2010 mesa jurado et al 2012 alcón et al 2014 guerrero baena et al 2019 have found that irrigators show a significant willingness to pay to reduce this uncertainty this evidences the need for new management instruments to cope with hydrological droughts risk in irrigated agriculture garrido and gómez ramos 2009 oecd 2016 among the alternative instruments suggested to date drought insurance has been pointed out as one of the most promising for this purpose rey et al 2018 guerrero baena and gómez limón 2019 indeed drought insurance is viewed as a key instrument for adapting irrigated agriculture to climate change since it improves the resilience of the irrigation sector which is having to cope with increasing uncertainty and vulnerability due to changing global conditions garrido et al 2012 varela ortega et al 2016 although agricultural insurance is widely used in developed countries meuwissen et al 2018 the risk of hydrological droughts in irrigated agriculture is not covered anywhere multiple factors that hinder the development of this kind of insurance scheme for a detailed explanation see guerrero baena and gómez limón 2019 explain why irrigators cannot take out insurance policies to protect themselves against financial losses resulting from water supply gaps however recent literature has suggested the implementation of index based hydrological drought insurance schemes i e where indemnities are calculated according to the value of an objective and non manipulable index correlated with the losses caused by the water supply gaps as a suitable option to minimize the key problems related to this kind of schemes such as moral hazard adverse selection and high administrative costs for in field damage evaluations or conflict resolution jensen and barrett 2017 1 1 however other major drawbacks affecting hydrological drought insurance remain unresolved in index based schemes such as considering droughts as a systemic risk and the uncertain performance of this insurance due to climate change both features involve a higher cost of reinsurance and thus give rise to affordability issues the proposals developed by zeuli and skees 2005 brown and carriquiry 2007 leiva and skees 2008 buchholz and musshoff 2014 maestro et al 2016 or guerrero baena and gómez limón 2019 are good examples of this kind of insurance scheme tailored to irrigated agriculture sectors worldwide nevertheless implementing the proposed insurance schemes in a real life setting requires additional empirical studies both from supply side and demand side perspectives studies based on the former approach are needed to calculate the commercial premiums that ensure the schemes under analysis are profitable for the insurance firm i e the aggregate revenues from the premiums collected are higher than the sum of the aggregate expected indemnities and other related management costs meanwhile demand side studies are needed to assess irrigators willingness to pay wtp for the insurance policies proposed the commercial viability of the proposed schemes can only be confirmed by comparing the results of both kinds of studies only when a significant share of potential insurees reports a wtp for the insurance policies proposed that exceeds the commercial premium demanded by the insurance firms can the insurance scheme under analysis be considered ready for implementation to date however most drought insurance studies have focused on the supply side i e the cost of the policy examples include the papers by pérez blanco and gómez 2013 2014 maestro et al 2016 and gómez limón 2020 of the small number of drought insurance studies that assess the demand side e g leiva and skees 2008 buchholz and musshoff 2014 only a few actually assess farmers wtp for this kind of insurance policy examples of such studies are the ones by quiroga et al 2011 who estimated farmers wtp for hydrological drought insurance as a percentage of the crop yield for the case of corn growers in spain and rey et al 2016 who assessed the wtp for this kind of insurance depending on farmers risk aversion levels in the segura basin southeastern spain in this sense this paper aims to contribute to the development of hydrological drought insurance schemes by implementing a new demand side analysis assessing the irrigators wtp for different policy designs possible for this kind of insurance most studies assessing farmers wtp for taking out an insurance policy have relied on the expected utility theory eut as the dominant paradigm explaining decision making under uncertainty following the eut farmers decisions have been modeled using a von neumann morgenstern utility function that allows the calculation of the certainty equivalent for any risky situation that is the guaranteed amount of money that the individuals would accept now rather than taking a chance on a higher but uncertain return in the future thus farmers wtp for taking out insurance policies has been calculated by comparing the sums of money characterizing the insured scenarios if they take out the policy and the uninsured scenarios if they do not in certainty equivalent terms the difference between these scenarios is always positive for risk averse farmers and is considered their maximum wtp for taking out the insurance a relevant example of the implementation of this approach can be found in the study by pérez blanco et al 2016 who explicitly calculated farmers wtp for farm income insurance considering different deductible values in a drought prone area in southeastern spain however recent evidence shows that farmers decisions about taking out insurance are not generally consistent with expected utility maximization assuming that farmers are risk averse and subsidized premiums are set below actuarially fair levels the eut rationale holds that all farmers should buy the highest level of coverage possible so long as subsidies are maximized at this level however du et al 2016 showed empirical evidence contradicting this theoretical inference and demonstrated that the probability of taking out an insurance product declines as the premiums increase even though higher values of these expenditures increase farmers expected utility similar conclusions that decisions about taking out insurance are generally not consistent with expected utility maximization have been reported by babcock 2015 and carter et al 2015 who suggested the prospect theory pt as an alternative theoretical framework to better understand farmers insurance decisions this calls for the use of other valuation techniques that are not based on stringent assumptions regarding the shape of farmers utility functions such as those imposed by the eut or the pt possible options include techniques based on stated preferences such as the contingent valuation method cvm or the choice experiment ce although these methods have already been used to analyze the demand for other types of agricultural insurance e g liesivaara and myyrä 2017 doherty et al 2021 they have not yet been applied to assess irrigators wtp for taking out hydrological drought insurance policies within this context the first objective of this paper is to assess irrigators wtp for index based hydrological drought insurance under different policy designs considering several amounts of insured capital insurance deductibles and contract terms for this purpose the index based hydrological drought insurance scheme proposed by guerrero baena and gómez limón 2019 is considered for implementation in a real world setting using ce as the valuation technique this objective is achieved empirically by providing a quantitative example in the guadalquivir river basin southern spain the results from this valuation exercise will illustrate the heterogeneity of irrigators preferences regarding hydrological drought insurance and thus the potential insurance adoption rate depending on the potential insurance premiums established for taking out these policies moreover it is worth pointing out that the second objective of this paper is to compare the demand side results obtained here with the supply side results reported by gómez limón 2020 who used actuarial analysis to calculate commercial premiums for this hydrological drought insurance scheme in the same irrigation district considered in this paper as a case study matching these two studies will allow an exploration of the commercial viability of the insurance scheme proposed the achievement of these two objectives will contribute to the existing literature by providing further insights into how to fine tune drought insurance policies supporting efficient decision making regarding the most suitable design for this agricultural insurance scheme in so doing this study aims to be useful for further developing a risk management instrument that can act as a buffer against the microeconomic effects of water supply gaps due to hydrological droughts ultimately the goal is to help improve the economic social and environmental performance of irrigated agriculture while guaranteeing its resilience in the face of global change 2 case study 2 1 the sector bxii irrigation district the sector bxii sbxii is an irrigation district covering 14 673 ha located on the left bank of the guadalquivir river southern spain near its mouth into the atlantic ocean this area was converted to irrigation during the 1980 s as its mediterranean climate mild wet winters and warm dry summers makes this district suitable for irrigated agriculture in any case the irrigation infrastructure and techniques have since been updated nowadays the sbxii is a valuable example of modern highly profitable irrigated agriculture production the sbxii is operated by 569 farmers average farm size of 25 8 ha who are organized into a water user association see www crsectorb12 es this association holds the collective right to 6000 cubic meters of water per hectare and year full water allotment granted by the river basin agency confederación hidrográfica del guadalquivir chg the association manages the distribution of the water among all its irrigators to which end it uses a fully modernized pressurized pipe network that allows for an on demand irrigation system the main crops currently grown in the district are cotton 45 of the total area tomato 22 other vegetables such as onions peppers and carrots 14 sugar beet 7 and cereals corn wheat and quinoa accounting for 6 these crops are mainly irrigated by sprinkler irrigation 71 of the total area although drip 28 and surface irrigation 1 techniques are also used depending on the crop nevertheless it is worth noting that there is wide heterogeneity in terms of productive profiles at the farm level with these profiles being based on both productive features size and crop mixes and farmers socio demographic characteristics age and educational level the main problem faced by irrigators in the sbxii is their vulnerability to water supply gaps i e water shortages during hydrological drought periods like most of the irrigation districts in the guadalquivir river basin grb the only source of water for the farmers in the sbxii is the supply of surface water provided annually by the chg annual water allocations in normal hydrological years when all water rights can be satisfied with the water stored in the reservoirs the chg allows the irrigators in the sbxii to use up to 6000 m3 ha annual water allocations equal to the full water allotment a volume that fully meets farmers water needs however this is not always the case the grb is characterized by a typical mediterranean climate with an average annual rainfall of 573 mm but this precipitation is rather heterogeneous across years leading to frequent hydrological drought events in these drought years when aggregate water availability i e water stored in the grb reservoir network is lower than aggregate full water allotments the chg has to ration water supply to irrigation districts following the proportional rule as established in the drought management plan chg 2018 considering current demand and supply constraints and the institutional framework set out in the guadalquivir river basin management plan chg 2015 the distribution of the annual water allocations for the case study irrigation district is shown in the histogram in fig 1 under hydrological drought circumstances annual water allocations provided by the chg are not enough to fully meet farmers water needs moreover since there is no possibility of alternative water sources in this irrigation district e g groundwater extracted from wells irrigators in the sbxii cannot reduce their vulnerability to hydrological drought thus when there are water supply gaps they have to adapt crop water needs to the lower water availability e g reducing the area actually irrigated these cuts in water allocations involve significant income losses for all these farmers that said the resulting losses differ notably among irrigators with much greater losses hitting more intensive farming i e those farmers specialized in high value crops such as tomato or other vegetables moreover it is worth noting that cyclical water shortages in the sbxii irrigation district are becoming more frequent and intense because of climate change bisselink et al 2018 therefore the already high and increasing vulnerability to irrigation water supply gaps evidences the need for hydrological drought insurance as a new management instrument to cope with this risk justifying the choice of this case study for the empirical analysis proposed here based on official statistics and data provided by local technicians a study on the profitability income and expenses of the crops grown in this irrigation district was carried out the information collected shows that all crops in the sbxii are cultivated similarly throughout the study area with a similar profit structure table 1 shows the average data regarding the profitability and the water needs for the main crops the characterization of irrigated farms in the sbxii was carried out by means of a survey conducted specifically for this study for this survey a representative sample n 202 of farmers in the study area n 569 was drawn individuals were randomly selected accounting for farm size quotas questionnaires were completed through face to face interviews between february and march 2022 with interviewers collecting data on a farm structure size land ownership labor b crop mix c irrigation systems d water management e farmers socio demographic characteristics age gender education household income f farmers opinion about previous experience with agricultural insurance and g the implementation of the valuation method used see section 3 the main characteristics of the farms and farmers sampled are reported in table 2 data gathered from irrigators show heterogeneity among farms in terms of crop mixes and thus profitability this means the capital to be insured by the proposed hydrological drought insurance should also be heterogeneous as explained in the following sections 2 2 the hydrological drought insurance in this section the index based hydrological drought insurance scheme proposed by guerrero baena and gómez limón 2019 and gómez limón 2020 is summarized pointing out the different design options worth considering for assessing irrigators demand for this kind of insurance the proposed hydrological drought insurance aims to protect the insured farmers against losses from irrigation water supply gaps thus the first key attribute of the insurance to be defined is how to calculate the insured capital ic as in any other mediterranean climate irrigated area agricultural operations in the sbxii usually begin in fall or winter depending on the crop with farmers preparing the soil for sowing taking advantage of the existing soil moisture from rainfall during the wet season fall and winter thus crops are grown throughout the spring and summer and harvested in early fall irrigation operations usually start in may at the beginning of the dry season late spring and summer under this agricultural calendar crop mix decisions are taken by farmers at the beginning of the agricultural year fall or winter however these decisions are made under uncertainty since information about water allocations for irrigation is not available until may 1st when the chg sets annual water allocations depending on the water stored in the reservoirs at the end of the wet season by may 1st when water allocation decisions are known irrigators in the sbxii have little leeway to cope with any water supply gap in fact the only option they have for dealing with the water constraints is to stop irrigating and cultivating a share or the whole of their irrigable land and leave it fallow gómez limón 2020 under these circumstances the insured capital could be defined considering three alternatives 1 the sum of all variable costs already spent on the irrigated crops by may 1st ic1 with this insured capital the indemnity received by the farmers would compensate only the working capital invested in the irrigated crops until may 1st when a share or the whole irrigated area would be left fallow 2 the aggregate expected gross margin income minus variable costs considering full water allotment ic2 this definition of the insured capital involves payment of indemnities to compensate farmers for the profit proxied by the aggregate gross margin foregone due to irrigation supply gaps thus it would partially compensate farmers for the losses in expected income i e under full irrigation water allotment circumstances since they would bear the costs of the working capital invested until may 1st in the crops that they have to stop irrigating because of water allocation gaps 3 the aggregate expected gross margin considering full water allotment plus the sum of all variable costs by may 1st ic3 this definition of the insured capital involves payment of an indemnity to cover both the profit foregone and the investment in working capital this is the only definition of the insured capital that actually guarantees the farmers income remains fully stable despite water supply gaps the several alternative amounts of insured capital can be easily estimated on a farm by farm basis by accounting for their crop mix and the average variable costs and gross margins for each irrigated crop within the irrigation district see table 1 considering the three abovementioned levels ic1 ic2 and ic3 allows us to analyze the role of the amount of the insured capital in farmers wtp for the proposed insurance and check for the possible existence of non linear relations between the two variables this analysis would be useful for informing the final design of the policy to be offered in any case it is assumed that once the final policy has been designed i e with just one option for the insured capital farmers would not be given a choice about the amount of capital to insure table 3 illustrates the heterogeneity in the amounts of insured capital showing the calculations considering the crop mixes of three farm types a average farm type based on the average crop mix in the sbxii b high value farm type based on a crop mix of 50 tomato and 50 other vegetables peppers and onion and c low value farm type based on a crop mix of 50 cotton and 50 sugar beet for the insurance proposed the occurrence of a loss is verified when the annual water allocation set by the chg is lower than the full water allotment in order to calculate these losses in a similar way for all insured farms it is assumed that farmers behave rationally as profit maximizers when choosing which crops to stop irrigating and that they therefore progressively abandon those with the lowest water productivity 2 2 there is ample evidence that farmers decision making can be more accurately simulated under the assumption that they are utility maximizers accounting for profit within non linear utility functions e g eut or pt or assuming multi attribute utility functions maufs i e those considering profit and other attributes such as risk or management complexity however it is worth explaining that assessing the losses in real life agricultural insurance schemes requires a simple i e easy to understand method that is similarly applied to all farmers i e regardless of the utility function they considered this justifies the use of the profit maximization assumption as the criterion for switching from cultivation to fallow since a it is the most widespread strategy to cope with hydrological drought events b it is easy to understand for all farmers and c it leads to reasonable approximations of the losses experienced by farmers during droughts this assumption lets us estimate the crop mixes for any annual water allocation lower than full water allotment thus enabling the calculation of the losses depending on the chosen insured capital that is based on the difference between the scenario with full water allotments and the scenario with the reduced annual water allocations i e only considering the crop area that can be actually irrigated in index based insurance losses and indemnities are calculated according to an objective and non manipulable index value in the case of the proposed hydrological drought insurance the most suitable index value is the amount of water stored in the reservoir network at the beginning of the irrigation season ws may 1 st measured as a percentage of the total storage capacity of the network guerrero baena and gómez limón 2019 every year once the value of ws may 1 st and the existing drought situation normality pre alert alert or emergency are known the chg sets the annual water allocations for irrigation following the guidelines established in the drought management plan chg 2018 considering this allocation rule losses caused by hydrological droughts can be estimated for insurance purposes as a function of the water stored on may 1st as follows 1 loss f ws may 1 st the indemnity i is the cash amount that the insurance company pays insured farmers which is equivalent to the value of the loss minus the deductible ded agreed in the policy i e the percentage of the insured capital that the farmer is responsible for covering in the case of the index based insurance scheme proposed the indemnity can be calculated after determining the value of the ws may 1 st index using the following expression gómez limón 2020 2 i 0 if 0 h w s m a y 1 s t d e d i c no loss h w s m a y 1 s t d e d i c if d e d i c h w s m a y 1 s t no loss i c 1 d e d if h w s m a y 1 s t i c total loss for analytical purposes different deductible ded levels have been considered for the demand assessment 0 10 20 and 30 this allows us to explore the relationship between the value of the deductible and farmers wtp for the proposed insurance and supports the final design of the policies that will eventually be commercially available 3 3 a 0 deductible would not be suitable for a commercial insurance policy because it goes against the principle of risk sharing between the insurer and the insuree and would involve unaffordable premiums however a zero deductible has been considered for scientific exploratory purposes since it allows us to isolate the effect of other attributes and to better analyze the relationship between the deductible and farmers wtp for the proposed insurance the proposed hydrological drought insurance is based on annual policies these policies should be formalized by paying the annual premium in september every year these contracts would be valid from the purchase of the policy to may 1st the following year when the ws may 1 st index is calculated and if losses have occurred indemnities can be claimed however it is worth pointing out that during the contracting period the potential insurees have information about the volume of water stored in the reservoir network at the beginning of the hydrological year october 1st potentially leading to some intertemporal adverse selection in order to minimize this problem which would jeopardize the viability of the insurance scheme the condition should be established that if a pre alert alert or emergency situation is declared during the contracting period september the proposed insurance can only be taken out by those who had drought insurance the previous year furthermore farmers who wish to take out a policy for the first time could also be required to sign a commitment that they will renew their policies for the next three or five years thus three different contract terms for new insurees have been considered for the demand assessment one year 4 4 as in the case of the 0 deductible a one year contract would not be suitable for a commercial insurance policy due to adverse selection issues however as in the previous case it is included for scientific exploratory purposes three years and five years 3 valuation method 3 1 choice modeling approach attributes levels and experimental design to analyze farmers preferences for taking out the proposed hydrological drought insurance a hypothetical market has been created using the stated preference method of the discrete choice experiment dce as the valuation method this method is based on lancaster s consumer theory lancaster 1966 and random utility theory mcfadden 1974 and has been previously used in the assessment of farmers preferences toward insurance policies e g aizaki et al 2021 doherty et al 2021 fu et al 2022 a detailed description of this valuation method can be consulted in hensher et al 2015 four attributes were selected to implement the dce method three non monetary and one monetary see table 4 with regard to the non monetary attributes the selected attributes correspond to the main characteristics of the hydrological drought insurance described in the previous section these are a the insured capital with three levels corresponding to the sum of variable costs until may 1st the aggregate gross margin considering full water allotments and the sum of variable costs until may 1st plus the aggregate gross margin considering full water allotments b the deductible with four levels 0 10 20 and 30 and c the contract term with three levels 1 3 and 5 years with regard to the monetary attribute it consists of the premium of the insurance defined as a percentage of the insured capital with six levels ranging from 2 to 12 the levels of the monetary attribute were based on the actuarial analysis carried out by gómez limón 2020 an efficient design minimizing the d error using bayesian techniques rose et al 2011 was employed for the experimental design due to the lack of prior information the priors for all the attributes were set close to zero with a negative sign except for the insured capital which was set at zero due to the uncertainty associated with the behavior of the farmers with respect to it 5 5 this attribute involves two opposite effects which combined could positively or negatively influence the utility function on the one hand the higher the amount of insured capital the higher the indemnities received by the farmer higher utility on the other hand a larger amount of capital also implies an increase in the premium to be paid lower utility since there is not enough information to indicate which effect would prevail we took the conservative approach of not imposing any sign the efficient design obtained consisted of 32 choice cards distributed in four blocks of eight cards each with a d error of 0 111 for the estimation of the experimental design the ngene 1 2 1 software was used a pilot of 60 interviews was conducted to assure the adequacy of the experimental design where it was found to be satisfactory and was therefore maintained before conducting the dce exercise the interviewed farmers were asked for information on the distribution of crops on the farm which was used to estimate the three possible levels of the farmer s insured capital the choice cards consisted of an insurance option with a combination of the levels of the four attributes and an opt out option no purchase of the proposed insurance to ensure the insurance option proposed in each choice card was readily understandable the cards included an illustrative graph showing the indemnities that the farmer would receive in the event of several reductions of his her annual water allocation these graphs were produced based on individual farmers crop distributions and the characteristics of the insurance option the level of insurance capital and the deductible although defined as a percentage of the insured capital the monetary attribute was shown to the farmer as a premium in euros per hectare ha calculated as the product of the insured capital and the level of the monetary attribute corresponding to the insurance option an example of a choice card is shown in fig 2 although it is recognized that the dce method overcomes most of the limitations related to other stated preference methods hanley et al 1998 it is worth noting that estimations using this valuation approach could be affected by hypothetical bias haghani et al 2021a the presence of this bias when using a dce depends on the type of good public or private the type of measurement wtp or wta and the familiarity or previous experience with the good or service guzman and kolstad 2007 schläpfer and fischhoff 2012 haghani et al 2021a our case study values a private good insurance policies and assesses wtp by farmers who have previous experience with insurance these features have been shown to be among those that are less susceptible to hypothetical bias farmers were given a cheap talk before the start of the dce exercise reminding them their budget was limited and that the money spent on the insurance could not be spent on other expenses on or off the farm interviewed farmers were also reminded that they could opt not to purchase the proposed insurance opt out reminder furthermore a self assessment question regarding perceived consequentiality was included at the end of the valuation exercise to assess whether farmers believed that their answer would actually be considered in the design of the proposed insurance results show that most farmers did perceive consequentiality i e they believed that their answers would be taken into account for the insurance design as evidenced by haghani et al 2021b the implementation of all these strategies minimizes the presence of hypothetical bias increasing the reliability of the estimates obtained following the exercise a question was included for farmers who were not willing to buy any of the offered insurance policies in these cases farmers were asked about the reason s for not taking out any insurance policies distinguishing between protest responses and real zero values from the total of 202 farmers who fully completed the questionnaires seven were considered to be protests reducing the total number of valid questionnaires to 195 3 2 econometric approach to analyze farmers preferences towards the proposed hydrological drought insurance a mixed logit model in wtp space was used the main advantage of these models is that they allow the direct estimation of the wtp of each attribute instead of deriving it from the distribution of utility coefficients which can be difficult or impossible with some choice of parameter distribution daly et al 2012 in addition they provide more reasonable distributions of the wtp train and weeks 2005 the model starts from a conventional specification of the utility function with n individuals t choice cards and j alternatives 1 u njt α n p njt β n χ njt ε where p njt is the insurance premium χ njt is a vector with the rest of the attributes and levels in the choice cards α n and β n are the utility coefficients for the premium and the other attributes respectively including a set of alternative specific constants asc which vary randomly over people and ε is a random term representing all unobserved components of the utility function which is assumed to be i i d type one extreme value and follows a gumbel distribution individuals wtp for the attributes is calculated as the ratio between the utility coefficients of the attribute β n and the premium coefficient α n therefore expression 1 can be reordered as follows 2 u njt α n p njt α n w n χ njt ε where w n is the wtp associated with these attributes as in expression 1 α n and w n are randomly distributed over people w n can be further decomposed in w n w w z z n where w is a vector of individual willingness to pay randomly distributed across the population following a density function f w θ with θ representing the parameters of the distribution and w z z n represents the heterogeneity in the mean of the wtp associated with the attributes and levels with w z being the coefficients to be estimated and z n a vector of individual characteristics the choices are modeled following a panel structure so that the probability integral is composed of a product of logistic formulae this integral does not have a closed form so its solution requires an iterative process train 2003 the model has been estimated using 1000 modified latin hypercube sampling mlhs draws hess et al 2006 assuming a normal distribution in all the parameters for modeling purposes all the attributes except for the premium have been treated as categorical variables thus the econometric model requires fixing one of the levels in each attribute as the base category with the coefficient values of the other levels representing the additional wtp associated with these levels over the base category in our case the lowest level in each attribute has been fixed as the base category that is the sum of variable costs until may 1st for the insured capital 0 for the deductible and one year for the contract term for a more in depth analysis of the heterogeneity of farmers preferences for the proposed hydrological drought insurance interactions of farm and farmers socio economic characteristics with the asc were included the modeling procedure was to include each of the selected variables those shown in table 2 in a single interaction wtp space model to check their significance in a second step all interactions found to be significant were included in a multiple interaction model from this model the least significant interactions were excluded one by one until a fully significant model was obtained all models were estimated with r using the apollo package version 0 2 7 hess and palma 2019 2022 4 results and discussion 4 1 wtp space model the results of the wtp space model are shown in table 5 the model presents a very high goodness of fit adjusted pseudo r2 0 503 in order to interpret these results it is worth clarifying that in a wtp space model all coefficients except those associated with the monetary attribute i e the premium in our case study represent the parameters of the distribution of the marginal wtp for the different attributes the results of the model show that all mean coefficients are highly significant the asc has a positive sign accounting for the average wtp i e a premium equal to 10 36 of the insured capital for the insurance designed with the fixed levels i e base categories mentioned above the premium coefficient also has a positive sign which implies a reduction in utility associated with the increase of the premium to be paid 6 6 as can be seen in expressions 1 and 2 the premium attribute is multiplied by 1 therefore the positive sign implies a negative effect in the utility function in contrast the rest of the attributes have a negative sign which indicates a reduction in the utility i e wtp attached to the insurance when the insured capital the deductible and the contract term are increased it should be recalled that the insurance premium is measured as a percentage of the insured capital therefore an increase in the insured capital implies the same proportional increase in the actual amount of money to be paid by the farmer for taking out the insurance however the higher the insured capital the higher the indemnity in the event of a water allotment shortage in this sense the negative sign obtained for the attribute insured capital indicates that the effect on the amount to be paid prevails over the effect on the indemnities this means that farmers are willing to pay a higher percentage for a lower level of insured capital because this entails a smaller payment although it also implies lower potential indemnities this effect is not appreciable when comparing the two higher levels of insured capital as no significant differences are found between the means of the two coefficients 7 7 the delta method has been used on the difference between the mean coefficients of both levels of insured capital showing that the difference between them is not different from zero this result indicates that farmers would be willing to pay on average the same percentage of their insured capital as an insurance premium if the variable costs on may 1st are added to the aggregate gross margin even though it would increase the payment in euros per hectare in the case of the deductible the higher the deductible the lower the wtp for the insurance this result is to be expected as the increase in the deductible would imply a lower probability of receiving an indemnity in the event of a water shortage i e the water shortage needed to receive an indemnity would be more acute and lower indemnities in every case see also pérez blanco et al 2016 for similar results however it is worth noting that the relationship between farmers wtp and the deductible is not linear the decline in wtp is less between the 30 deductible and the 20 deductible than between 20 and 10 and between 10 and 0 finally regarding the contract term the results show that increasing contract duration represents a disutility for farmers i e lower wtp for the insurance as a longer contract term means they are committed to paying the insurance and reduces their capacity to implement other alternative risk management instruments e g precautionary savings as a self insurance alternative as in the case of the deductible the relation between the contract term and the wtp is not linear the decline is greater for an increase in the contract term from one to three years than from three to five three significant interactions were found between socio economic variables and the asc see table 5 first the interaction between full time farmers and the asc turns out to be negative indicating those farmers have a lower wtp to insure their farms against hydrological droughts this result could be due to these farmers perceiving that they have a higher degree of control over their farm allowing them to better adapt their crop mix and irrigation strategies in cases of water shortage goodwin 1993 another potential explanation is that full time farmers are more likely to implement other alternative risk management instruments to make them less vulnerable to drought events such as diversification mishra et al 2004 on the other hand the interaction with the percentage of cotton on the farm yields a positive result indicating that the higher the presence of this crop on the farm the stronger the farmers preference for the insurance in this regard it should be noted that in the case study area cotton represents a relatively low profit option compared to other alternative crops such as vegetables therefore the insured capital would similarly be lower as a result the actual insurance premium would be lower as the percentage of cotton increases finally the interaction with the coefficient of constant relative risk aversion crra also has a positive coefficient indicating that more risk averse farmers would be more willing to insure their farms this finding is aligned with those reported by jin et al 2016 or zhang et al 2021 although it contrasts with the evidence found by giné et al 2008 or cole et al 2013 in any case the standard deviation coefficients turn out to be significant for most attributes and the asc see table 5 indicating the existence of heterogeneity among farmers preferences with regard to these attributes which has not been captured by the interactions with the mean included in the model the only exceptions are the insured capital when it accounts for the aggregate gross margin of the farm and the 10 deductible therefore further research is needed to explore other sources of heterogeneity in irrigators wtp for the proposed insurance 4 2 wtp for different drought insurance designs table 6 shows the mean wtp for different hydrological drought insurance designs both as the percentage of the insured capital and in euros per hectare considering the case of the average farm in the sbxii shown in table 3 in this table only the designs with significant positive wtp are reported however it is worth noting that there are also alternative mixes with negative mean wtp more specifically those including a high deductible and or an extended contract term e g the alternative combining an insured capital var costs may 1st gross margin a deductible of 30 and a contract term of 5 years they can thus be ruled out as promising policy designs mean wtp for the different hydrological drought insurance considered ranges between 12 77 var costs may 1st 0 deductible 1 year and 2 24 var costs may 1st gross margin 30 deductible 1 year of the insured capital according to the results explained in the previous section it can be seen that the wtp decreases as the insured capital the deductible and the contract term increase mean wtp for the proposed insurance in euros per hectare ranges between 72 58 and 360 80 ha since the expected indemnities increase with the insured capital the premium per hectare that farmers are willing to pay to purchase the insurance is higher for options with higher levels of insured capital i e aggregate expected gross margin and aggregate expected gross margin plus the sum of all variable costs by may 1st however the percentage of the insured capital that farmers are willing to pay for these options is lower than for the lowest level of the insured capital sum of all variable costs by may 1st the only exception is for the option of a deductible of 30 where the estimated mean wtp in euros per hectare for the first level of insured capital variable costs by may 1st is slightly higher than for the second level aggregate expected gross margin although the difference between them is not significant 8 8 tested using the delta method for the difference between the two estimates of mean wtp on the other hand the premiums farmers are willing to pay are lower when the contract term or the deductible increase this reduction is greater for higher levels of insured capital for example for the variable costs by may 1st option increasing the contract term from one to three years yields a reduction in the payment of 33 85 ha while for the aggregate gross margin plus variable costs by may 1st option this reduction is 132 06 ha likewise increasing the deductible from 0 to 30 reduces the wtp by 67 65 ha for the first level of insured capital with a reduction of 263 94 ha for the highest level of insured capital the results pertaining to the deductible are comparable to those reported by liesivaara and myyrä 2014 2017 who also found that increasing the deductible reduces farmers wtp for insurance policies in the case of the contract term doherty et al 2021 found that farmers who had already insured their farms showed higher wtp for longer contract terms while farmers not currently insuring their farms presented lower wtp in such cases given that the proposed hydrological drought insurance is not yet available and farmers have no previous experience with this risk management instrument our finding is aligned with that reported by these authors in any case further research is needed in order to clarify farmers preferences toward longer or shorter contract terms 4 3 probability of taking out the insurance gómez limón 2020 implemented an actuarial analysis aimed at calculating the commercial premiums for the same hydrological drought insurance and irrigated district considered in this paper these premiums are the prices that insurance companies would request to underwrite the different policies of the proposed drought insurance the results found in that study can be seen in the third column of table 7 it should be noted that in the previous study only differences in the insured capital and the deductible were analyzed considering a one year contract term in every case thus only the premium based on one year term policies can be included in the wtp comparison in this paper it is worth noting that while the commercial premium is a deterministic value i e it is the same for all potentially insured farmers the wtp for taking out the insurance is a probabilistic value i e it is distributed among the population of targeted farmers this is shown graphically in fig 3 where the probability of taking out the insurance measured on the horizontal axis is charted for the case of the average farm in the sbxii considering an insurance policy designed with a 10 deductible and one year contract term as can be observed the commercial premiums are represented by horizontal lines depending only on the insured capital while the wtp values are represented by downward sloping lines meaning that the lower the premium the higher the uptake of insurance this chart actually represents the insurance supply i e commercial premium and demand wtp which reach the market equilibrium at their intersection pointing to the probability of taking out the insurance in the example shown in fig 3 these probabilities are 65 5 for the insured capital accounting for variable costs may 1st 1 6 for the insured capital accounting for the gross margin and 3 4 for the insured capital accounting for the variable costs may 1st plus the gross margin according to the probabilities of taking out the insurance shown in the last column of table 7 for every policy design it can be seen that only policy designs considering the variable costs may 1st as insured capital would be commercially successful in all these cases the share of farmers contracting the drought insurance would be above 65 reaching 83 1 when this insured capital is combined with a deductible of 30 other policy designs based on a deductible of 30 could also have commercial potential although with a much more limited potential market share of farmers taking out the drought insurance slightly below 30 the rest of the designs have very low contracting rates and thus insurance firms would have no interest in bringing them to market 5 conclusions the results provide evidence that farmers would be willing to pay for index based hydrological drought insurance showing a higher preference for policy designs with a smaller amount of insured capital i e variable costs until may 1st lower deductible i e 0 and shorter contract term i e one year the novelty of the proposed insurance could explain these results it is plausible that once farmers get used to the insurance they would be more willing to purchase other options involving a larger amount of insured capital higher deductible and longer contract term the results also show the existence of heterogeneity among farmers preferences depending on their socio economic characteristics full time farmers would be more reluctant to purchase the proposed insurance while those with a higher percentage of the farm devoted to cotton the most important crop in the study area and who are more risk averse would pay a higher premium for contracting the insurance furthermore we compared the distribution of farmers wtp for different policy design options of the proposed drought insurance with the commercial premium estimated using actuarial analysis the results show that the options with the insured capital based on variable costs until may 1st are the only ones with a mean wtp lower than the commercial premium i e probability of taking out the insurance above 50 the rest of the policy design options would have to be subsidized as other agricultural insurance schemes are i e a share of the premium would be paid by the public sector to make them attractive to most farmers the evidence above suggests it would be advisable to start implementing the proposed hydrological drought insurance initially only marketing policies in which the insured capital accounts for variable costs incurred until may 1st moreover it is expected that once the farmers have gained some experience with this risk management instrument all the other different policy design options would become more attractive i e the wtp would increase thus reducing the need for public subsidies to make policies with higher levels of insured capital and longer contract terms more appealing finally it is worth noting that this work is not free of methodological limitations the most relevant one affects all valuation exercises based on stated preferences since the lucas critique applies in this case in fact the results reported should be considered simply a snapshot of the case study analyzed at the time the survey was carried out notwithstanding market prices inputs and outputs agricultural policy instruments implemented and water allocation criteria in effect at this time in the sbxii cannot be considered structural characteristics of this irrigation district but are policy variants this means any estimation of farmers wtp for the proposed insurance policies is context specific and does not account for the actual dynamics of farmers preferences depending on changes in the circumstances this limitation calls for new empirical evidence on farmers wtp for hydrological drought insurance in different market agricultural policy or water management frameworks to check the reliability and stability of the results declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the

9162,intensive agriculture is increasingly associated with environmental degradation that may jeopardise long term environmental and economic sustainability the high dike system in the upper mekong delta that has enabled intensive rice cultivation represents a prime example of these potential negative feedbacks the lack of seasonal flooding and the associated depletion of nutrients is expected to affect farmer income as productivity declines and more fertiliser is required therefore emphasis has shifted towards more sustainable flood based agriculture however farmer uptake has its challenges based on a compilation of different household surveys we first analyse rice farmers ability and willingness to transition and subsequently study the economic sustainability of intensive rice based livelihoods a motivation and ability mota survey reveals that two thirds of the surveyed rice farmers are reluctant to change to flood based farming systems as they consider rice cultivation to be economically viable in the near future they also mention financial and technical ability as key constraints subsequently we analyse yield and fertiliser developments for a large sample of farming households under different dike systems between 2008 and 2015 this shows that income from rice farming grew steadily under high dike systems as productivity growth compensated for higher input requirements this growth is partly dampened by the slightly higher negative impacts of potential flood damage in high dike areas compared low dike areas a counterintuitive effect that is related to the fact that high dikes remain prone to dike overtopping or breaching in the flooding season resulting in potentially higher damage than low dike areas that are able to crop flood based alternatives the observed growth in income is a likely explanation for the reluctance to change in the studied period our analysis also shows that rice income growth is unequally distributed in high dike areas with lower incomes being associated with new high dike systems and slower growth of incomes of smallholder rice farmers compared to large scale farms this makes smallholder rice farmers in high dike areas especially vulnerable to changing conditions and thus a priority target group for policy makers promoting flood based alternatives recent commune level yield data show that the past productivity growth has stalled increasing the prospects for alternative flood based agriculture this transition can be facilitated by enhancing the economic viability of flood based crops and particularly for smallholder farmers by improving their financial and technical capabilities through supportive policies keywords land and water management rice farmer income farmer behaviour climate adaptation vietnam mekong delta inequality data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction worldwide deltas are densely populated and cultivated the rich provision of ecosystem services makes deltaic environments highly productive agricultural areas nguyen et al 2018 syvitski and saito 2007 and many deltas have been characterised by rapid agricultural intensification and increased crop productivity in the past decades enabled by technologic advancements and large scale hydraulic infrastructure hazell 2009 kuenzer and renaud 2012 however the increased food production is contributing to a number of adverse environmental and socioeconomic impacts pingali 2012 renaud et al 2013 stuart et al 2018 zhao et al 2006 which are expected to worsen in the future due to climate change mckenzie and williams 2015 to ensure the long term sustainability of agricultural production alternative farming systems are proposed dogliotti et al 2014 keating et al 2010 tilman et al 2001 this requires a radical shift in agricultural behaviour that is often difficult to put in practice due to required technical capital and social changes a prime example of a delta that is currently undergoing this process is the intensive rice production system in the upper mekong delta in vietnam and the commitment of the national government to transform the delta into a sustainable and climate resilient agriculture and food production system gov 2017 the vietnam mekong delta is often cited as the rice bowl of vietnam as it contributes to over half of the total rice output of vietnam tong 2017 tran et al 2018b the dominance of rice cultivation in the delta is the result of the rice first government policy of the last decades targeting food security and enforcing a certain level of rice production for each mekong delta province this manifested in large investments and upgrades of the hydraulic system which enabled a reclamation of acid sulphate soils in the upper mekong delta for rice cultivation le et al 2018 tran and weger 2018 the construction of dikes sluices and irrigation infrastructure in combination with for example technology changes such as new farming techniques mechanisation for land preparation and the introduction of high yielding rice varieties enabled a transformation from low productivity e g floating rice to double and triple rice cropping a year le et al 2018 nguyen et al 2018 tran and weger 2018 tran and kajisa 2006 over the past two decades and particularly after the severe floods in 2000 and 2011 the construction of high dikes intensified in the upper mekong delta le et al 2018 as a result the yearly seasonal flooding of the rice fields ceased this enabled farmers to crop rice three times annually leading to higher farmer income tran et al 2018b the high dike systems however also have negative environmental and socioeconomic consequences van nha 2006 the wet season flooding of the former double rice low dike system provided flood based livelihoods such as catching wild fish and shrimps or harvesting floating rice or vegetables that were especially important to the poor and landless käkönen 2008 tran and weger 2018 the lack of such livelihoods contributed to higher inequality and out migration tran 2019 in addition soil nutrients stocks are no longer replenished by sedimentation a study of chapman and others 2016 reveals that average sediment deposition depth is reduced by two centimetres in high dike systems in an giang province part of the upper delta to compensate decreasing soil fertility farmers are required to use more advanced farming and irrigation technologies and higher levels of pesticide and fertilisers degrading land and soil quality further in the long run chapman et al 2016 howie 2011 huan et al 2008 kien 2014 tong 2017 van nha 2006 this impacts farmer income as they use more inputs to obtain similar yields chapman et al 2016 dawe et al 2000 huan et al 2008 the lack of floods also hampers the process of flushing toxic agrochemicals off the fields further affecting soil quality hung et al 2014 manh et al 2014 other spill over effects of high dike developments are associated with changed local floodwater dynamics and decreased flood water retention capacity in the upper mekong delta which increases flood risks in surrounding and downstream areas le et al 2007 triet et al 2017 trung and tuu 2012 furthermore the irrigation networks and dike systems have enabled salt water to flow further inland in the dry season hoang et al 2016 tuan et al 2007 some studies emphasise the exclusion of land poor farmers due to profit marginalisation and second order impacts such as increased degrees of specialisation and larger workloads leading to further out migration of the more productive part of the workforce chapman and darby 2016 tran 2019 in the last decade the national government has started to recognise the consequences of its intensive rice oriented agricultural policies and has endeavoured to restructure the agricultural sector by introducing flexible rice production targets discouraging high dike development and stimulating the adoption of sustainable rice farming strategies berg et al 2017 le et al 2018 tong 2017 different studies suggest that adoption of double rice and flood based farming systems can result in higher net revenues than intensive triple rice systems kien 2014 tong and clarke 2019 tran et al 2018b at the same time many farm households are reluctant to adopt alternative flood based farming models and still prefer high dikes and intensive rice farming smajgl et al 2015 tran and weger 2018 for example a policy strategy in which the paddy field is flooded every third year to allow nutrients to enter the field the 3 3 2 policy has not been adopted widely chapman and darby 2016 tran and weger 2018 several studies indicate this is due to farmers impression that floodwater brings no or limited fertile sediments hung et al 2014 tran and weger 2018 a recent study by tran et al 2021 however shows a more positive perception with regards to the benefits of floodwater for sustainable livelihoods tran et al 2021 this paper aims to address the economic sustainability of different rice farming systems and how this may influence farmers decision making with regards to adopting more sustainable flood based models we analyse what drives farmer behaviour by assessing the motivation and willingness of farmers to change their current farming practices and by quantitatively estimating the evolution of farmer income of different dike systems and farm types we analyse this impact on farm income for different farm sizes and dike systems over the past decade to analyse if certain groups of farmers or specific areas are particularly vulnerable to changing conditions this enhances our knowledge on farmer behaviour and contributes to understanding the willingness to adopt proposed flood based farming systems the first part of this research consists of analysing the results of a motivation and ability study in the upper mekong delta followed by a regression model to identify different factors influencing the evolution of rice yields and fertiliser input per dike type and farm size using a unique compilation of different survey results this is followed by a discussion on farmer income development for different farm sizes under old and new high and low dike systems to account for a key benefit of high dikes flood protection we also estimate the annual expected rice income loss of farmers under different dike systems as a result of different flood events we finally reflect on a key driver of economic sustainability the rice yield growth and how this has developed in recent years 2 materials and method 2 1 study site in this study we focus on two upper vietnamese mekong delta provinces dong thap and an giang see fig 1 both are characterised by fertile alluvial soils near the bassac and mekong river branches and acid sulphate soils in the long xuyen quadrangle and the plain of reeds floodplains large investments in the drainage and canal systems enabled a rapid expansion of agricultural land use which primarily consisted of double rice cultivation within low dike systems since 2000 the government has made substantial efforts to further intensify rice production which led to dike heightening and conversion of double to triple rice le et al 2007 sakamoto et al 2009a as a result triple rice land use expanded substantially especially in an giang province and to a moderate extent in dong thap province from 84 000 hectare in 2002 to 276 500 hectare in 2014 double cropping decreased from 425 000 hectare to 238 000 hectare between this period sakamoto et al 2009a 2 2 stratification of dike systems in line with tran et al 2018b in this study we distinguished between low dike systems old high dike systems and new high dike systems and expected that initially the old high dike systems would have higher yields due to their favourite conditions compared to the initial years of new high dikes this is confirmed by interviews with key experts from iucn and can tho university who indicated that the first dikes were heightened in those spatial locations that were most cost effective these were locations with the best suitable biophysical conditions for intensive rice cultivation characterised by deep inundation levels in the flood period 1 5 m and with favourable accessibility in terms of road infrastructure and markets these first dikes were heightened in the late 1990 s and intensified after a historical flood event in 2000 le et al 2007 dike heightening has continued throughout the 2000 s until the present we conducted a k means cluster analysis used to differentiate between old and new high dike systems the k means cluster analysis is a reduction technique to group similar observation in a dataset by minimising the difference between them hartigan and wong 1979 the cluster analysis identified that three quarters of the surveyed farmers in dike areas that were heightened after 2004 belonged to a cluster that was characterised by lower yields and fertiliser use in contrast two thirds of the farmers in dike systems heightened prior to 2004 were clustered in groups with either very high or high yields we therefore classified old high dike areas as those areas with dikes heightened prior to 2004 and new high dike areas with dikes heightened since 2004 an anova test showed that both the mean yield and fertiliser values between the dike categories are significantly different see footnote in table 1 the spatial stratification of the different dike types in dong thap and an giang province is based on spatial data from the institute for agro environmental sciences national agriculture and food research organization japan niaes that classify three types of rice land use single double and triple rice in a period of 11 years between 2001 and 2012 based on the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis sakamoto et al 2009a fig 1 shows the result of the spatial distribution of the different dike types as well as the survey locations table 1 highlights the descriptive statistics per dike system and shows that on average yields are higher in old high dike and low dike areas with the former applying the largest amounts of fertiliser 2 3 data collection and analysis our research focuses primarily on survey data from an giang province but also includes survey data from two districts in dong thap province the farmer households surveyed in the different communes are spatially dispersed throughout the upper delta and provides a balanced mixture of double and triple rice land use three distinct household survey databases are integrated for this study the first dataset originates from the center of water management and climate change wacc and is used to assess rice farmer willingness and capability to switch from rice farming to alternative more sustainable farming models the dataset consists of 150 close ended household questionnaires and is built around the motivation and ability mota framework phi et al 2015 this framework aims to measure the implementation potential of adaptation options by scoring and analysing the correlation between perception motivation and ability nguyen et al 2019 the mota framework assesses key components of behaviour how is an external event or change in conditions trigger perceived does it motivate an actor to change behaviour and does the actor have the ability to change its behaviour this is relevant for our study as we explore the motivation to change is the trigger negatively influencing farmer incomes and the ability to change can the farmer change if faced with lower incomes the dataset includes numerous household characteristics farm size annual rice production age education level living condition assets as well as specific indicators representing perceptions motivations and abilities e g further divided into financial technical institutional and social ability unfortunately information on farming costs was lacking making it unsuitable for income calculations nevertheless the wealth of information on socioeconomic characteristics motivation and ability made it highly suitable to estimate household behaviour and perception towards rice farming relative to alternative farming systems most farmers were double rice farmers with an occasional triple rice farmer alternative farming systems include rice shrimp rise fish and rice lotus farming systems in dong thap province and rice shrimp upland cropping and floating rice in an giang province iucn and vawr 2016 we used the database to analyse the percentage of farmers that is un willing to change and to identify key variables that significantly explain the un willingness through a regression analysis the second and third databases are combined and used to estimate farmer income over time the second dataset originates from a study done by chapman et al 2016 and consists of a total of 195 rice farmer household surveys across nine communes under different dike systems farmers reported their cropping pattern sediment depth rice yields ton ha season and fertiliser application kg ha season over several years 2008 2013 as well as their farm size omitting missing or inconsistent values led to a sample size of 783 the third dataset consists of survey outcomes among 45 farmer households representing farmers under different dike systems low dikes and new high dikes completed within the past five years and old high dikes in operation for more than 15 years tran et al 2018b the surveys were conducted in four communes in an giang province and two communes in dong thap province each with both high and low dike systems different farm characteristics were reported such as the age of the farmer farm size ha and education level combining multiple databases raises the issue of comparability of the data we ensured data consistency by only using variables in our statistical analysis that were defined and measured in the same way which were first season rice yields ton ha season first season fertiliser use ton ha season and farm size to further assess comparability of the datasets we tested whether there were significant differences between the mean values of key variables table 2 shows descriptive of the key variables per data source a one way analysis of variance anova was executed and shows that the means of yield and farm size for the different data sources are not significantly different however fertiliser kg ha is significantly higher for the dataset of tran this might be explained by an annual increase in fertiliser use and the different years of the dataset chapman 2008 2013 tran 2015 when comparing only the last year 2013 of the dataset of chapman with the dataset of tran 2015 all variable means are not significantly different see anova sig 2013 2015 p 0 221 in table 2 to estimate farmer income we used cost revenue components based on the third dataset tran et al 2018b which included the selling price of rice and prices of different cost components fertiliser pesticide input and pumping costs see table 3 information on a three year contribution to dike construction for triple rice farmers was also part of the survey we used provincial level information from dard department of agriculture and rural development on remaining cost components such as land preparation seeds sowing and other costs harvesting transport to accurately assess relative changes in household income over time we used fixed price levels for rice and the different cost components over time to ensure that time dependent changes can only be contributed to changes in yields and fertiliser pesticides inputs to augment and properly interpret our quantitative results several in depth interviews were held with representatives from dard in dong thap province and with several key experts from can tho university iucn and wacc in april 2019 we applied ordinary least square ols multivariate regression analyses to explain spatial and temporal variation in yields fertiliser and pesticide input in three separate models 1 y t β 1 t c β 2 d f β 3 f t β 4 l f β 5 f t d f β 6 f t l f β 7 f t t 2 f t β 1 d f β 2 t β 3 l f β 4 d f t β 5 d

dike system referring to either a low dike old high dike or new high dike system and l f the size of the farm in hectares equation 1 and 2 contain several interaction variables to identify whether yields and fertiliser application differ per dike systems over time and per land size data on pesticide use was only available for one year originating from the dataset of tran 2018 specification per different crop season was available see table 7 in results section 2 4 farmer income calculations we calculate farmer income based on annual rice revenues minus the associated costs for production per hectare of farmland in this study the terminology of income thus represents the net income or profits generated by farming activities e g gross revenues from produce minus the cost required for generating this we calculated several revenue and cost components based on the outcomes of the regression model and combined this with cost estimations from provincial level sources and the studies from tran 2018 and chapman 2016 rice revenue is the product of the selling price of rice per season derived from dard and tran 2018 multiplied by the rice yields per season and calculated on an annual basis yields per dike type have been predicted based on the regression outcomes of the wet yields for the first season of rice the first season was chosen as this is the most important season for rice farmers however this might have led to a slight underestimation of the effects as the second season of rice potentially bears the similar or even higher negative consequences differentiation of yield by season is based on several data from dard iucn and vawr 2016 and tran et al 2018b which all find similar percentages for double cropping rice 55 of annual yield from the 1st season 45 from the 2nd season for triple rice 39 32 and 29 respectively for the 1st 2nd and 3rd season the market price of rice is kept constant over the years as the rice market is relatively stable due to guaranteed government prices tran et al 2018a to prevent overcomplexity we did not differentiate prices depending on rice variety farming method and negotiation power however as small scale farmers lack the power to negotiate over prices our results might overestimate revenues of the smaller farmer tran et al 2021 we do account for negotiation powers between farm sizes for input costs different cost components have been included in the analysis table 4 an economies of scale factor has been applied to account for slight discounts on bulk purchases for the input costs as these variable costs are typically lower when larger volumes of fertiliser and pesticides are acquired several studies indicate a better bargaining position for large scale farmers as they are less debt constraint to traders and input providers ba et al 2019 minh and maerten 2012 tran et al 2021 a finding that was also confirmed during our expert interviews following the in depth interviews with several experts we therefore assume a 1 discount on input prices per hectare of farm size in the result section 4 1 we test the sensitivity to this assumption by showing results with and without this discount factor representing the economies of scale of large scale farmers 2 5 average annual flood risk to calculate the average annual impact on farm income due to flood risks for different dike systems we use different gridded inundation maps of triet 2018 we follow their method to assess flood risk as the product of the probability of occurrence of a flood and its impact depending on the season and extent of flooding this risk is calculated as the fraction of the yield that on average is lost in a year using separate equations for the second and third crop afr2 tn snjuly e1 rd1 tn snjuly e2 rd2 afr3 tn snannual e1 rd1 tn snannual e2 rd2 in which afr2 and afr3 are the average annual flood risk for the second and third rice crop respectively tn is the probability of a flood expressed in its return period sn the probability of a flood occurring in a particular season or annually e1 and e2 represent the exposed areas classified as partial 50 or full 100 loss rd1 and rd2 are the relative damage factor for partial 0 5 and full crop loss 1 0 the flood risk assessment considers four flood return periods ranging from once every hundred years t 100 to once every ten years t 10 and four synthetic flood hydrographs s 1 4 that describe the probabilities for the timing of the peak discharge dung et al 2015 to account for early flood damages in the second cropping season the peak discharges until july 31 are considered s 1 4jul y for damages in the third cropping season the peak discharge for the entire flood season is used s 1 4annual the extent of a flood event is inferred from the spatial representations of simulated floods provided by triet 2018 we distinguish between the areas in which crop loss is expected to be maximal water depth exceeding 0 5 m and crop loss is assumed to be 50 depth less than 0 5 m for each scenario combination of t and s we derived the total area in the relevant depth class and used this percentage as probability of partial or full crop loss 3 results 3 1 farmer motivation to change to alternative farming systems as presented in table 5 analysis of the mota survey reveals that the majority of farmers 62 is unwilling to change to alternative farming systems such as rice fish rice shrimp or lotus farming the key variables that significantly 1 1 with a relatively low r2 of 0 234 which is not uncommon in research estimating human behaviour see for example hill 1997 explain the low willingness are financial capacity and living condition more than half of the farmers stated that they had very low to no financial ability to afford a transition which were among others caused by their small land sizes and insufficient income to allow for additional loans the respondents of the survey further cited a lack of agricultural technique unsuitable water infrastructure and farming conditions as key reasons for their unwillingness to transition in general farmers recognise the environmental unsustainability of intensive rice cultivation with 68 indicating it decreases soil quality and or depletes fresh water sources 47 furthermore a large majority of farmers acknowledge an increase in biophysical risks such as tropical storms droughts higher temperatures and soil fertility decrease despite recognising these risks 66 of surveyed farmers still expect their current farming practices to remain economically sustainable in the next five years and indicate that better farming techniques quality of seeds farming material and equipment have improved rice productivity this is in line with data and in depth interviews with key experts from dard in dong thap that indicate that new rice varieties and technology enhancements have continued to increase yields in the past decade this is further underpinned by the study of tran 2019 that show a widespread adoption of agricultural mechanisation in the upper mekong delta in recent years nevertheless some farmers indicate worse economic conditions with regards to the on farm selling price 55 and their profits 39 also seasonal labour supply has worsened according to 48 of replicants despite constraints for transitioning many farmers see the potential for organic flood based products considering its prospects as better 35 or similar 43 compared to five years ago 3 2 variation of yields fertilisers and pesticides table 6 shows the ols results with interaction introduced in a step wise order all interaction models 2 4a show significant differences in first season yields per dike system with farmers in old high dike systems seemingly having higher yields compared to farmers within new high dike and low dike systems reference category this is offset however by their remarkably lower input efficiency table 6 model 3a an additional ton of fertiliser use leads to 3 8 ton ha less yield under new high dike systems and 5 3 tons ha less for old high dike systems compared to the same addition under low dike systems in combination these results suggest that yields in old high dike areas are sustained by larger amounts of fertiliser as was also discussed by several authors chapman et al 2016 tong 2017 van nha 2006 our results show that rice yields increase annually with 9 implying continuing productivity gains under all dike systems we assume that this is related to an increase in fertiliser application as the year variable becomes insignificant when the interaction with fertiliser use is taken into account see table 6 model 4a the insignificance of this interaction term implies that there is a large variation in changing fertiliser use over time between farmers which may be attributable to differences in farmers opportunities to acquire more input but our data does not allow testing for this both yields and fertiliser application also depend on farm size on average yields decrease by 16 when farm size increases by 1 hectare this is in line with the common view of a strong inverse relationship between farm size and land productivity due to relatively higher labour input as they can rely on family labour fan and chan kang 2005 this is however more than compensated by more efficient fertiliser application by large scale farmers the variation in fertiliser use for different farm sizes is particularly evident within high dike systems table 6 column 3b in low dike systems fertiliser application is slightly higher for large scale farmers while it is much higher within high dike systems each year fertiliser application increases significantly in old and new high dike areas respectively with 13 and 14 kg year compared to the low dike reference category to illustrate the combined impact of regional and temporal variation and land size we estimated average yields for farmers with 1 hectare of land which we consider smallholder farmers in line with the mota analysis an average rice farm size in the upper mekong delta is approximately 1 2 ha and for large scale farmers with 10 ha of land fig 2a smallholder farmers are slightly more efficient compared to 10 hectare farmers in the first year respectively 2 and 1 within new high and old high dike areas but over time the yield ha is surpassed by large scale farmers due to higher fertiliser application of large scale farmers in old and new high dike systems both smallholder and large scale farmers have increased their fertiliser use under high dike systems at the same pace indicating that an increase in input was needed fig 2b fig 2 visualises the regression outcomes of models 3a and 3b the outcomes of model 4a were not used as the interaction between year and fertiliser use is insignificant and barely contributes to an increase in explanatory value regression analyses on the data available on pesticide use shows major differences in pesticide use per dike system table 7 farmers within old high dike systems use the most pesticide per hectare and farmers under low dike systems use the least 23 less pesticides than farmers in old high dike systems farmers under new high dikes use 15 less pesticide compared to farmers under old high dike systems 4 potential implications of results 4 1 implications for rice farmer income temporal development of rice farmer income was estimated based on the regression results for several characteristic farmer types these represent typical smallholder and large scale farming households in the three different dike systems due to an increase in fertiliser application rice farms of all sizes and within different dike systems are thus far able to increase their yields and income incomes of low dike farmers is highest in the first season fig 3a because of less input requirements interestingly the income of smallholders increases over time in low dike systems but this stabilises under old high dike systems due to higher amounts of input required as a result of three rice seasons annual rice farmer income is highest within old high dike systems for all years and farm sizes but substantially lower within new high dike systems fig 3b despite requiring less fertiliser to achieve their yields in our calculations annual income remains lowest in low dike systems after eight years as the outcomes only show two seasons of rice revenues however it can be expected that rice farmers in low dike systems utilise the third flood season for alternative flood based livelihoods or off farm seasonal incomes tran et al 2018b which is not included in our annual calculations thus the most relevant comparison between the dike systems is presented in fig 3a and c a striking difference in the slope of the lines depicting income indicates a steady and equal increase of income for both a smallholder and large scale farmer under a low dike system while the income growth is less and more unequal for different farm sizes within high dike systems annual income growth is lowest for smallholder farmers within old high dike system which only experience limited income increases over time the small farm productivity advantage fan and chan kang 2005 is translated in higher incomes per unit of land however when accounting for an economies of scale factor to represent their better negotiation position initial income advantage per unit of land of smallholder farmers is overtaken by large scale farmers over time under high dike systems fig 3c and d the results indicate that changing from double rice cropping in a low dike system to triple rice cropping in a new high dike system pays off at first due to the income increases of an additional rice crop however this does not consider other income sources for double rice farmers in the third season furthermore the effect wears off over time for the smallholder farmer the gap between a low and new high dike income diminishes rapidly for the smallholder farmer per unit of land 4 2 impact of flood protection on farmer income besides enabling different farming systems the primary benefit of dikes is flood protection and thus safeguarding farmer livelihood and income yet flood risk cannot be prevented completely this section examines to what extent flood risk impacts farm income within low and high dike areas flood risk in high dike areas is mainly caused by dike overtopping or breaches in the flooding season the amount of damage depends on the flood event and moment of the peak flood as both the second and third crop are potentially damaged with early floods that typically inundate the area for 2 5 months farmers in low dike areas can be affected by floods when they occur early and partially or fully damage the second crop yields the resulting annual flood risk is 0 017 for double rice farmers thus on average double rice farmers lose 1 7 of their second crop yields table 8 for triple rice farmers the annual flood risk is 0 035 thus on average 3 5 of second and third rice yield is lost due to flood risks this difference can be ascribed to the relatively large extent of areas that are likely to get flooded because of dike overtopping in the flooding period these results imply a slightly higher average annual rice income loss for farmers in high dike areas compared to in low dike areas which marginally improves the cost benefit analysis for double rice farming compared to triple rice farming note however that the results are aggregated over the total study area for specific locations and individual farmers the impact can devastating 4 3 stalling rice yields our results show a steady yield growth under all dike systems as a result of increased inputs the fact that increased inputs still result in higher productivity albeit more inefficiently under high dike systems has been the primary driver of growing farm income in the surveyed period of 2008 2015 however many studies suggest that decreased soil fertility due to rice intensification eventually impedes yield growth binh et al 2022 hui et al 2022 tran et al 2021 2018b to examine this we assessed the average winter spring spring autumn 2nd season and autumn winter 3rd season rice yields at the commune level in dong thap and an giang province in the period 2000 2018 this data was collected from the statistical yearbooks of the department of agriculture and natural resources dard as registered by the vietnam statistical office gso 2020 and refers to the most detailed administrative level in vietnam this data sketches the broader local context in which farmers make their decisions it furthermore allows us to validate and compare the trends based on the productivity of the individual farmers sampled in the various surveys we included in our analysis with aggregate averaged outcomes fig 4 shows a steady productivity growth of all seasons continuing until roughly 2011 2012 after which yields show signs of a stabilisation and for some communes even a slight decline in recent years we expect however that the decline in 2016 and 2017 was primarily caused by the extreme drought in winter spring of 2015 2016 nguyen 2017 therefore we make the modest assumption that yield growth has stagnated to test this hypothesis we perform district fixed effects ols regression analysis comparing commune average two year yields with yields in the first period 2000 2001 this approach corrects for structural differences between regions and highlights the temporal trend as table 9 shows yields increased steadily from 2002 to 2003 until 2008 2009 for all rice seasons after which productivity growth continues at a slower pace peak levels are reached in the years 2014 2015 after which yield levels stabilise this reinforces the findings in section 3 2 between the period 2008 and 2015 farmers still experienced productivity growth hence it was not just the sampled farmers who witnessed their yields go up but also their neighbours in the community this may well explain the reluctance to adapt their farming strategies as was concluded from the mota survey the stalling rice yields since 2015 may however gradually change this perception and increase their willingness to adopt to other farming practices or find alternative income sources 5 discussion 5 1 reflections on key findings numerous studies indicate the negative long term environmental and economic costs of high dike development and rice intensification in the upper mekong delta chapman et al 2016 käkönen 2008 tong and clarke 2019 tran et al 2018b van staveren et al 2017 yuen et al 2021 the government of vietnam increasingly acknowledges the adverse effect and is committed to transform the agricultural sector by promoting a transition to a controlled flooding system which uses low dikes and more sustainable flood based farming systems gov 2017 however paramount for a successful transition is the motivation and capability of local farmers to adopt the proposed alternative systems nguyen et al 2019 smajgl et al 2015 despite the acknowledged disadvantages of high dike systems and long term benefits of flood compatible farming systems our survey results showed that the ability and willingness of rice farmers in the upper mekong delta to transition to flood based farming systems was still relatively low in 2015 almost two thirds of farmers preferred continuing and intensifying rice cultivation as they expected rice farming practices to remain economically sustainable in the long term this is in line with a study from tran and weger 2018 in which farmers indicated they preferred intensifying their rice cultivation they also indicated a lack of financial and technical ability as key barriers to adopt new farming practices these findings are in agreement with similar studies in the mekong delta which show that prime reasons not to adopt alternative farming are insufficient skills contentment with current practices and lack of investment capacity at the household level nguyen et al 2019 smajgl et al 2015 tran et al 2021 at the same time most farmers do express concern about environmental impacts of intensive rice cropping systems in particular soil fertility decreases and freshwater depletion recent studies show that these concerns have increased in recent years and that the appreciation of flood based alternatives is on the rise hui et al 2022 lan and van kien 2021 tran et al 2021 yuen et al 2021 our study shows that during the study period until 2015 rice yields were consistently increasing under both low and high dike systems as a result of increased fertiliser use and technological enhancements increasing yields and thus higher revenues were compensating for rising input costs due to higher levels of agrochemicals used in high dike systems thus farmers under high dike systems did not experience the negative economic consequences to the extent that it incentivized them to change farming practices the economic incentive as dominant motivator for preferring environmentally unsustainable farming systems is also found in a recent study by luu et al 2022 that show that high dike development flood changes and livelihood transformations happen in an ad hoc manner that is principally motivated by economic gains at the same time we find that the input efficiency of farmers in old high dike areas is considerably lower compared to new high dike and low dike areas in old high dike areas the effect of adding additional fertiliser to the system is only marginally contributing to additional yield implying that the soil quality has suffered as a result of years of intensive rice cultivation although the input efficiency yield to fertiliser is still relatively high in the early years of high dike construction this rapidly decreases over time to the level of older high dikes while it remains relatively stable for farmers in low dike areas this is in line with findings of tran et al 2019 that show lower profit margins for old high dikes compared to farmers in recently constructed new high dike systems this posits a risk to the income levels of farmers in high dike areas as declining crop biophysical suitability can only marginally be compensated by adding agrochemicals to the system another key outcome of the analysis is the unequal evolution of rice farmer income for smallholder 1 ha farmers compared to large scale farmers in high dike areas whereas the income of a large scale rice farmer increases steadily in high dike systems the income growth of a smallholder farmer is much slower the dampening effect on rice farmer income due to increased input requirements makes smallholders in high dike systems particularly vulnerable to changing conditions with increasing input requirements the incomes of smallholders is increasingly marginalised while they are also considered to be less resilient to future fertiliser price spikes chapman and darby 2016 a recent study of tran et al 2021 indicate that rice farmers are constantly prone to poverty due to the lack of power to negotiate over prices this causes many to fall into cycles of indebtedness which forces some farmers to sell their land to large corporates and triggers migration this process of out migration is further accelerated by widespread adoption of agricultural mechanisation and the reduction of opportunities to collect aquatic flood based resources which increases inequalities in farmer income in high dike systems tran 2019 the alternative flood based farming systems are aimed at contributing to a more environmentally and economically sustainable agricultural delta development however results of this study show some of the mechanisms why adoption of these systems is challenging as long as rice productivity increases annually as a result of technological enhancements and increased inputs the negative consequences of more input requirements is dampened as rice farm income continues to grow this was the case in our study period 2008 2015 our analysis of yield developments at commune level reveals that yield growth has slowed down in the past decade see table 8 this opens a window of opportunity for alternative more sustainable flood based system dang et al 2021 lan and van kien 2021 recent evidence of this is also confirmed by a study of tran et al 2021 that finds an increased appreciation of the 3 3 2 rice system in 2019 compared to 2015 other studies find that nature based agriculture and organic farming models are becoming more established in the mekong delta with more wide spread support lan and van kien 2021 this is also due to better economic perspectives for flood based crops dang et al 2021 the notable fall in triple rice crop area between 2016 and 2019 in an giang province emphasises this development hui et al 2022 although smallholder farmers are the first to experience the negative consequences of stalling yields under triple rice cultivation they indicate a lack of financial and technical capability to transfer table 5 this is recently confirmed by a study of tran et al 2021 that reports technologies skills and initial investment costs as prime constraints to adopt flood based crops despite improved circumstances for flood based alternatives the adoption rate will remain low if different farmer groups are not effectively targeted smallholders are most helped if their financial and technical capability is improved while large scale farmers would be more receptive to opportunities to maximise their profitability by clear and certain cost benefit analyses of the alternative systems this thus requires more tailor made policy efforts for different farmer groups 5 2 limitations and future outlooks this study combines the output of several surveys undertaken in the period 2008 2015 perceptions and circumstances are likely to change certainly in view of the stalling yields we observe at communal level this is likely to increases support for more sustainable farming systems in the area as is described in recent literature dang et al 2021 hui et al 2022 lan and van kien 2021 it is therefore recommended to conduct new surveys to analyse how farmers respond to these changing conditions and how that affects their willingness to adapt to alternative farming practices this study focuses on the evolution of yields and fertiliser of the first rice crop with the assumption that effects are similar for the second and third crop in future research it would be interesting to explore these crops separately to investigate whether these crops are affected differently furthermore in our annual income calculation we exclude potential additional activities of double crop farmers in the flood season due to the wide variety of possible alternatives which potentially underestimates our annual income for low dike farmers this could be further explored in future studies to get a complete picture of total annual agricultural incomes this study focused on the upper mekong delta region it would also be interesting to focus on impacts of higher salinity levels on farmer income and livelihoods for the middle and coastal area caused by combined effects of sea level rise and subsidence as a result of unsustainable groundwater abstraction and upstream dam and dike developments farmer responses to these impacts particularly with respect to out migration and adoption of sustainable farming models are likely to differ depending on different farm profiles determining their abilities and motivations further research might help in understanding why certain farmers are more reluctant or able to switch to other practices or why they might opt to leave the agricultural sector in combination with more research to assess the local variation in cost benefits of alternative farming systems this may help the government in deciding which instruments enable farmers in certain locations to switch to alternative more climate resilient systems a key reason mentioned by farmers to switch to high dikes is that it offers better flood protection huu 2011 kien 2014 renaud and kuenzer 2012 sakamoto et al 2009b tran et al 2018b however triple rice farmers on average still have a higher flood risk due to the higher annual flood risk for the third crop due to dike overtopping and breaches in this study we averaged annual flood risk over space leading to only a minor flood risk however some areas are much more flood prone than others including the spatial variation in flood risk in future research of rice farmer income would be interesting also besides flood safety and higher farmer incomes high dikes also provide additional benefits to farmers such as a better connectivity to markets as roads are oftentimes constructed on top of the dikes the absence of yearly floods also enables wealthier farmers to invest in perennial crops fruits and vegetables that require high investment costs or to raise poultry or cattle tran and weger 2018 once a critical mass is reached there will be minimal incentive to regain to seasonal flooding creating a locked in situation luu et al 2022 these additional activities also add to the expected annual damage so future studies would benefit from including these elements 6 conclusions this study makes use of different survey datasets to assess a key driver behind local farmer s motivation to pursue intensive rice cultivation economic sustainability based on our analysis we conclude that a majority of the rice farmers 66 perceived triple rice cultivation as economically sustainable in the short term although many rice farmers recognise the environmental unsustainability of this model their preference for a stable income hampers large scale transitioning to more sustainable flood based alternative farming models our regression analysis supports this finding and shows that income continues to grow under high dike systems as yield growth compensates for higher input requirements this confirms the suggestion that economic incentives remain the most dominant motivator for preferring a certain farming system during our survey period the economic viability of triple rice was sustained due to a steady increase in rice productivity over time our commune level analysis shows that this is no longer self evident which opens a window of opportunity for more environmentally sustainable farming models we also found that income growth is unequally distributed between smallholders and large scale farmers under high dike systems due to increased input requirements and lower negotiation power of smallholders at the same time smallholders lack investment and technological ability to transition this makes smallholder farmers a key priority target group to offer supported strategies to make alternative farming systems economically viable declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgement this research was

9162,intensive agriculture is increasingly associated with environmental degradation that may jeopardise long term environmental and economic sustainability the high dike system in the upper mekong delta that has enabled intensive rice cultivation represents a prime example of these potential negative feedbacks the lack of seasonal flooding and the associated depletion of nutrients is expected to affect farmer income as productivity declines and more fertiliser is required therefore emphasis has shifted towards more sustainable flood based agriculture however farmer uptake has its challenges based on a compilation of different household surveys we first analyse rice farmers ability and willingness to transition and subsequently study the economic sustainability of intensive rice based livelihoods a motivation and ability mota survey reveals that two thirds of the surveyed rice farmers are reluctant to change to flood based farming systems as they consider rice cultivation to be economically viable in the near future they also mention financial and technical ability as key constraints subsequently we analyse yield and fertiliser developments for a large sample of farming households under different dike systems between 2008 and 2015 this shows that income from rice farming grew steadily under high dike systems as productivity growth compensated for higher input requirements this growth is partly dampened by the slightly higher negative impacts of potential flood damage in high dike areas compared low dike areas a counterintuitive effect that is related to the fact that high dikes remain prone to dike overtopping or breaching in the flooding season resulting in potentially higher damage than low dike areas that are able to crop flood based alternatives the observed growth in income is a likely explanation for the reluctance to change in the studied period our analysis also shows that rice income growth is unequally distributed in high dike areas with lower incomes being associated with new high dike systems and slower growth of incomes of smallholder rice farmers compared to large scale farms this makes smallholder rice farmers in high dike areas especially vulnerable to changing conditions and thus a priority target group for policy makers promoting flood based alternatives recent commune level yield data show that the past productivity growth has stalled increasing the prospects for alternative flood based agriculture this transition can be facilitated by enhancing the economic viability of flood based crops and particularly for smallholder farmers by improving their financial and technical capabilities through supportive policies keywords land and water management rice farmer income farmer behaviour climate adaptation vietnam mekong delta inequality data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction worldwide deltas are densely populated and cultivated the rich provision of ecosystem services makes deltaic environments highly productive agricultural areas nguyen et al 2018 syvitski and saito 2007 and many deltas have been characterised by rapid agricultural intensification and increased crop productivity in the past decades enabled by technologic advancements and large scale hydraulic infrastructure hazell 2009 kuenzer and renaud 2012 however the increased food production is contributing to a number of adverse environmental and socioeconomic impacts pingali 2012 renaud et al 2013 stuart et al 2018 zhao et al 2006 which are expected to worsen in the future due to climate change mckenzie and williams 2015 to ensure the long term sustainability of agricultural production alternative farming systems are proposed dogliotti et al 2014 keating et al 2010 tilman et al 2001 this requires a radical shift in agricultural behaviour that is often difficult to put in practice due to required technical capital and social changes a prime example of a delta that is currently undergoing this process is the intensive rice production system in the upper mekong delta in vietnam and the commitment of the national government to transform the delta into a sustainable and climate resilient agriculture and food production system gov 2017 the vietnam mekong delta is often cited as the rice bowl of vietnam as it contributes to over half of the total rice output of vietnam tong 2017 tran et al 2018b the dominance of rice cultivation in the delta is the result of the rice first government policy of the last decades targeting food security and enforcing a certain level of rice production for each mekong delta province this manifested in large investments and upgrades of the hydraulic system which enabled a reclamation of acid sulphate soils in the upper mekong delta for rice cultivation le et al 2018 tran and weger 2018 the construction of dikes sluices and irrigation infrastructure in combination with for example technology changes such as new farming techniques mechanisation for land preparation and the introduction of high yielding rice varieties enabled a transformation from low productivity e g floating rice to double and triple rice cropping a year le et al 2018 nguyen et al 2018 tran and weger 2018 tran and kajisa 2006 over the past two decades and particularly after the severe floods in 2000 and 2011 the construction of high dikes intensified in the upper mekong delta le et al 2018 as a result the yearly seasonal flooding of the rice fields ceased this enabled farmers to crop rice three times annually leading to higher farmer income tran et al 2018b the high dike systems however also have negative environmental and socioeconomic consequences van nha 2006 the wet season flooding of the former double rice low dike system provided flood based livelihoods such as catching wild fish and shrimps or harvesting floating rice or vegetables that were especially important to the poor and landless käkönen 2008 tran and weger 2018 the lack of such livelihoods contributed to higher inequality and out migration tran 2019 in addition soil nutrients stocks are no longer replenished by sedimentation a study of chapman and others 2016 reveals that average sediment deposition depth is reduced by two centimetres in high dike systems in an giang province part of the upper delta to compensate decreasing soil fertility farmers are required to use more advanced farming and irrigation technologies and higher levels of pesticide and fertilisers degrading land and soil quality further in the long run chapman et al 2016 howie 2011 huan et al 2008 kien 2014 tong 2017 van nha 2006 this impacts farmer income as they use more inputs to obtain similar yields chapman et al 2016 dawe et al 2000 huan et al 2008 the lack of floods also hampers the process of flushing toxic agrochemicals off the fields further affecting soil quality hung et al 2014 manh et al 2014 other spill over effects of high dike developments are associated with changed local floodwater dynamics and decreased flood water retention capacity in the upper mekong delta which increases flood risks in surrounding and downstream areas le et al 2007 triet et al 2017 trung and tuu 2012 furthermore the irrigation networks and dike systems have enabled salt water to flow further inland in the dry season hoang et al 2016 tuan et al 2007 some studies emphasise the exclusion of land poor farmers due to profit marginalisation and second order impacts such as increased degrees of specialisation and larger workloads leading to further out migration of the more productive part of the workforce chapman and darby 2016 tran 2019 in the last decade the national government has started to recognise the consequences of its intensive rice oriented agricultural policies and has endeavoured to restructure the agricultural sector by introducing flexible rice production targets discouraging high dike development and stimulating the adoption of sustainable rice farming strategies berg et al 2017 le et al 2018 tong 2017 different studies suggest that adoption of double rice and flood based farming systems can result in higher net revenues than intensive triple rice systems kien 2014 tong and clarke 2019 tran et al 2018b at the same time many farm households are reluctant to adopt alternative flood based farming models and still prefer high dikes and intensive rice farming smajgl et al 2015 tran and weger 2018 for example a policy strategy in which the paddy field is flooded every third year to allow nutrients to enter the field the 3 3 2 policy has not been adopted widely chapman and darby 2016 tran and weger 2018 several studies indicate this is due to farmers impression that floodwater brings no or limited fertile sediments hung et al 2014 tran and weger 2018 a recent study by tran et al 2021 however shows a more positive perception with regards to the benefits of floodwater for sustainable livelihoods tran et al 2021 this paper aims to address the economic sustainability of different rice farming systems and how this may influence farmers decision making with regards to adopting more sustainable flood based models we analyse what drives farmer behaviour by assessing the motivation and willingness of farmers to change their current farming practices and by quantitatively estimating the evolution of farmer income of different dike systems and farm types we analyse this impact on farm income for different farm sizes and dike systems over the past decade to analyse if certain groups of farmers or specific areas are particularly vulnerable to changing conditions this enhances our knowledge on farmer behaviour and contributes to understanding the willingness to adopt proposed flood based farming systems the first part of this research consists of analysing the results of a motivation and ability study in the upper mekong delta followed by a regression model to identify different factors influencing the evolution of rice yields and fertiliser input per dike type and farm size using a unique compilation of different survey results this is followed by a discussion on farmer income development for different farm sizes under old and new high and low dike systems to account for a key benefit of high dikes flood protection we also estimate the annual expected rice income loss of farmers under different dike systems as a result of different flood events we finally reflect on a key driver of economic sustainability the rice yield growth and how this has developed in recent years 2 materials and method 2 1 study site in this study we focus on two upper vietnamese mekong delta provinces dong thap and an giang see fig 1 both are characterised by fertile alluvial soils near the bassac and mekong river branches and acid sulphate soils in the long xuyen quadrangle and the plain of reeds floodplains large investments in the drainage and canal systems enabled a rapid expansion of agricultural land use which primarily consisted of double rice cultivation within low dike systems since 2000 the government has made substantial efforts to further intensify rice production which led to dike heightening and conversion of double to triple rice le et al 2007 sakamoto et al 2009a as a result triple rice land use expanded substantially especially in an giang province and to a moderate extent in dong thap province from 84 000 hectare in 2002 to 276 500 hectare in 2014 double cropping decreased from 425 000 hectare to 238 000 hectare between this period sakamoto et al 2009a 2 2 stratification of dike systems in line with tran et al 2018b in this study we distinguished between low dike systems old high dike systems and new high dike systems and expected that initially the old high dike systems would have higher yields due to their favourite conditions compared to the initial years of new high dikes this is confirmed by interviews with key experts from iucn and can tho university who indicated that the first dikes were heightened in those spatial locations that were most cost effective these were locations with the best suitable biophysical conditions for intensive rice cultivation characterised by deep inundation levels in the flood period 1 5 m and with favourable accessibility in terms of road infrastructure and markets these first dikes were heightened in the late 1990 s and intensified after a historical flood event in 2000 le et al 2007 dike heightening has continued throughout the 2000 s until the present we conducted a k means cluster analysis used to differentiate between old and new high dike systems the k means cluster analysis is a reduction technique to group similar observation in a dataset by minimising the difference between them hartigan and wong 1979 the cluster analysis identified that three quarters of the surveyed farmers in dike areas that were heightened after 2004 belonged to a cluster that was characterised by lower yields and fertiliser use in contrast two thirds of the farmers in dike systems heightened prior to 2004 were clustered in groups with either very high or high yields we therefore classified old high dike areas as those areas with dikes heightened prior to 2004 and new high dike areas with dikes heightened since 2004 an anova test showed that both the mean yield and fertiliser values between the dike categories are significantly different see footnote in table 1 the spatial stratification of the different dike types in dong thap and an giang province is based on spatial data from the institute for agro environmental sciences national agriculture and food research organization japan niaes that classify three types of rice land use single double and triple rice in a period of 11 years between 2001 and 2012 based on the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis sakamoto et al 2009a fig 1 shows the result of the spatial distribution of the different dike types as well as the survey locations table 1 highlights the descriptive statistics per dike system and shows that on average yields are higher in old high dike and low dike areas with the former applying the largest amounts of fertiliser 2 3 data collection and analysis our research focuses primarily on survey data from an giang province but also includes survey data from two districts in dong thap province the farmer households surveyed in the different communes are spatially dispersed throughout the upper delta and provides a balanced mixture of double and triple rice land use three distinct household survey databases are integrated for this study the first dataset originates from the center of water management and climate change wacc and is used to assess rice farmer willingness and capability to switch from rice farming to alternative more sustainable farming models the dataset consists of 150 close ended household questionnaires and is built around the motivation and ability mota framework phi et al 2015 this framework aims to measure the implementation potential of adaptation options by scoring and analysing the correlation between perception motivation and ability nguyen et al 2019 the mota framework assesses key components of behaviour how is an external event or change in conditions trigger perceived does it motivate an actor to change behaviour and does the actor have the ability to change its behaviour this is relevant for our study as we explore the motivation to change is the trigger negatively influencing farmer incomes and the ability to change can the farmer change if faced with lower incomes the dataset includes numerous household characteristics farm size annual rice production age education level living condition assets as well as specific indicators representing perceptions motivations and abilities e g further divided into financial technical institutional and social ability unfortunately information on farming costs was lacking making it unsuitable for income calculations nevertheless the wealth of information on socioeconomic characteristics motivation and ability made it highly suitable to estimate household behaviour and perception towards rice farming relative to alternative farming systems most farmers were double rice farmers with an occasional triple rice farmer alternative farming systems include rice shrimp rise fish and rice lotus farming systems in dong thap province and rice shrimp upland cropping and floating rice in an giang province iucn and vawr 2016 we used the database to analyse the percentage of farmers that is un willing to change and to identify key variables that significantly explain the un willingness through a regression analysis the second and third databases are combined and used to estimate farmer income over time the second dataset originates from a study done by chapman et al 2016 and consists of a total of 195 rice farmer household surveys across nine communes under different dike systems farmers reported their cropping pattern sediment depth rice yields ton ha season and fertiliser application kg ha season over several years 2008 2013 as well as their farm size omitting missing or inconsistent values led to a sample size of 783 the third dataset consists of survey outcomes among 45 farmer households representing farmers under different dike systems low dikes and new high dikes completed within the past five years and old high dikes in operation for more than 15 years tran et al 2018b the surveys were conducted in four communes in an giang province and two communes in dong thap province each with both high and low dike systems different farm characteristics were reported such as the age of the farmer farm size ha and education level combining multiple databases raises the issue of comparability of the data we ensured data consistency by only using variables in our statistical analysis that were defined and measured in the same way which were first season rice yields ton ha season first season fertiliser use ton ha season and farm size to further assess comparability of the datasets we tested whether there were significant differences between the mean values of key variables table 2 shows descriptive of the key variables per data source a one way analysis of variance anova was executed and shows that the means of yield and farm size for the different data sources are not significantly different however fertiliser kg ha is significantly higher for the dataset of tran this might be explained by an annual increase in fertiliser use and the different years of the dataset chapman 2008 2013 tran 2015 when comparing only the last year 2013 of the dataset of chapman with the dataset of tran 2015 all variable means are not significantly different see anova sig 2013 2015 p 0 221 in table 2 to estimate farmer income we used cost revenue components based on the third dataset tran et al 2018b which included the selling price of rice and prices of different cost components fertiliser pesticide input and pumping costs see table 3 information on a three year contribution to dike construction for triple rice farmers was also part of the survey we used provincial level information from dard department of agriculture and rural development on remaining cost components such as land preparation seeds sowing and other costs harvesting transport to accurately assess relative changes in household income over time we used fixed price levels for rice and the different cost components over time to ensure that time dependent changes can only be contributed to changes in yields and fertiliser pesticides inputs to augment and properly interpret our quantitative results several in depth interviews were held with representatives from dard in dong thap province and with several key experts from can tho university iucn and wacc in april 2019 we applied ordinary least square ols multivariate regression analyses to explain spatial and temporal variation in yields fertiliser and pesticide input in three separate models 1 y t β 1 t c β 2 d f β 3 f t β 4 l f β 5 f t d f β 6 f t l f β 7 f t t 2 f t β 1 d f β 2 t β 3 l f β 4 d f t β 5 d

yields and fertiliser application differ per dike systems over time and per land size data on pesticide use was only available for one year originating from the dataset of tran 2018 specification per different crop season was available see table 7 in results section 2 4 farmer income calculations we calculate farmer income based on annual rice revenues minus the associated costs for production per hectare of farmland in this study the terminology of income thus represents the net income or profits generated by farming activities e g gross revenues from produce minus the cost required for generating this we calculated several revenue and cost components based on the outcomes of the regression model and combined this with cost estimations from provincial level sources and the studies from tran 2018 and chapman 2016 rice revenue is the product of the selling price of rice per season derived from dard and tran 2018 multiplied by the rice yields per season and calculated on an annual basis yields per dike type have been predicted based on the regression outcomes of the wet yields for the first season of rice the first season was chosen as this is the most important season for rice farmers however this might have led to a slight underestimation of the effects as the second season of rice potentially bears the similar or even higher negative consequences differentiation of yield by season is based on several data from dard iucn and vawr 2016 and tran et al 2018b which all find similar percentages for double cropping rice 55 of annual yield from the 1st season 45 from the 2nd season for triple rice 39 32 and 29 respectively for the 1st 2nd and 3rd season the market price of rice is kept constant over the years as the rice market is relatively stable due to guaranteed government prices tran et al 2018a to prevent overcomplexity we did not differentiate prices depending on rice variety farming method and negotiation power however as small scale farmers lack the power to negotiate over prices our results might overestimate revenues of the smaller farmer tran et al 2021 we do account for negotiation powers between farm sizes for input costs different cost components have been included in the analysis table 4 an economies of scale factor has been applied to account for slight discounts on bulk purchases for the input costs as these variable costs are typically lower when larger volumes of fertiliser and pesticides are acquired several studies indicate a better bargaining position for large scale farmers as they are less debt constraint to traders and input providers ba et al 2019 minh and maerten 2012 tran et al 2021 a finding that was also confirmed during our expert interviews following the in depth interviews with several experts we therefore assume a 1 discount on input prices per hectare of farm size in the result section 4 1 we test the sensitivity to this assumption by showing results with and without this discount factor representing the economies of scale of large scale farmers 2 5 average annual flood risk to calculate the average annual impact on farm income due to flood risks for different dike systems we use different gridded inundation maps of triet 2018 we follow their method to assess flood risk as the product of the probability of occurrence of a flood and its impact depending on the season and extent of flooding this risk is calculated as the fraction of the yield that on average is lost in a year using separate equations for the second and third crop afr2 tn snjuly e1 rd1 tn snjuly e2 rd2 afr3 tn snannual e1 rd1 tn snannual e2 rd2 in which afr2 and afr3 are the average annual flood risk for the second and third rice crop respectively tn is the probability of a flood expressed in its return period sn the probability of a flood occurring in a particular season or annually e1 and e2 represent the exposed areas classified as partial 50 or full 100 loss rd1 and rd2 are the relative damage factor for partial 0 5 and full crop loss 1 0 the flood risk assessment considers four flood return periods ranging from once every hundred years t 100 to once every ten years t 10 and four synthetic flood hydrographs s 1 4 that describe the probabilities for the timing of the peak discharge dung et al 2015 to account for early flood damages in the second cropping season the peak discharges until july 31 are considered s 1 4jul y for damages in the third cropping season the peak discharge for the entire flood season is used s 1 4annual the extent of a flood event is inferred from the spatial representations of simulated floods provided by triet 2018 we distinguish between the areas in which crop loss is expected to be maximal water depth exceeding 0 5 m and crop loss is assumed to be 50 depth less than 0 5 m for each scenario combination of t and s we derived the total area in the relevant depth class and used this percentage as probability of partial or full crop loss 3 results 3 1 farmer motivation to change to alternative farming systems as presented in table 5 analysis of the mota survey reveals that the majority of farmers 62 is unwilling to change to alternative farming systems such as rice fish rice shrimp or lotus farming the key variables that significantly 1 1 with a relatively low r2 of 0 234 which is not uncommon in research estimating human behaviour see for example hill 1997 explain the low willingness are financial capacity and living condition more than half of the farmers stated that they had very low to no financial ability to afford a transition which were among others caused by their small land sizes and insufficient income to allow for additional loans the respondents of the survey further cited a lack of agricultural technique unsuitable water infrastructure and farming conditions as key reasons for their unwillingness to transition in general farmers recognise the environmental unsustainability of intensive rice cultivation with 68 indicating it decreases soil quality and or depletes fresh water sources 47 furthermore a large majority of farmers acknowledge an increase in biophysical risks such as tropical storms droughts higher temperatures and soil fertility decrease despite recognising these risks 66 of surveyed farmers still expect their current farming practices to remain economically sustainable in the next five years and indicate that better farming techniques quality of seeds farming material and equipment have improved rice productivity this is in line with data and in depth interviews with key experts from dard in dong thap that indicate that new rice varieties and technology enhancements have continued to increase yields in the past decade this is further underpinned by the study of tran 2019 that show a widespread adoption of agricultural mechanisation in the upper mekong delta in recent years nevertheless some farmers indicate worse economic conditions with regards to the on farm selling price 55 and their profits 39 also seasonal labour supply has worsened according to 48 of replicants despite constraints for transitioning many farmers see the potential for organic flood based products considering its prospects as better 35 or similar 43 compared to five years ago 3 2 variation of yields fertilisers and pesticides table 6 shows the ols results with interaction introduced in a step wise order all interaction models 2 4a show significant differences in first season yields per dike system with farmers in old high dike systems seemingly having higher yields compared to farmers within new high dike and low dike systems reference category this is offset however by their remarkably lower input efficiency table 6 model 3a an additional ton of fertiliser use leads to 3 8 ton ha less yield under new high dike systems and 5 3 tons ha less for old high dike systems compared to the same addition under low dike systems in combination these results suggest that yields in old high dike areas are sustained by larger amounts of fertiliser as was also discussed by several authors chapman et al 2016 tong 2017 van nha 2006 our results show that rice yields increase annually with 9 implying continuing productivity gains under all dike systems we assume that this is related to an increase in fertiliser application as the year variable becomes insignificant when the interaction with fertiliser use is taken into account see table 6 model 4a the insignificance of this interaction term implies that there is a large variation in changing fertiliser use over time between farmers which may be attributable to differences in farmers opportunities to acquire more input but our data does not allow testing for this both yields and fertiliser application also depend on farm size on average yields decrease by 16 when farm size increases by 1 hectare this is in line with the common view of a strong inverse relationship between farm size and land productivity due to relatively higher labour input as they can rely on family labour fan and chan kang 2005 this is however more than compensated by more efficient fertiliser application by large scale farmers the variation in fertiliser use for different farm sizes is particularly evident within high dike systems table 6 column 3b in low dike systems fertiliser application is slightly higher for large scale farmers while it is much higher within high dike systems each year fertiliser application increases significantly in old and new high dike areas respectively with 13 and 14 kg year compared to the low dike reference category to illustrate the combined impact of regional and temporal variation and land size we estimated average yields for farmers with 1 hectare of land which we consider smallholder farmers in line with the mota analysis an average rice farm size in the upper mekong delta is approximately 1 2 ha and for large scale farmers with 10 ha of land fig 2a smallholder farmers are slightly more efficient compared to 10 hectare farmers in the first year respectively 2 and 1 within new high and old high dike areas but over time the yield ha is surpassed by large scale farmers due to higher fertiliser application of large scale farmers in old and new high dike systems both smallholder and large scale farmers have increased their fertiliser use under high dike systems at the same pace indicating that an increase in input was needed fig 2b fig 2 visualises the regression outcomes of models 3a and 3b the outcomes of model 4a were not used as the interaction between year and fertiliser use is insignificant and barely contributes to an increase in explanatory value regression analyses on the data available on pesticide use shows major differences in pesticide use per dike system table 7 farmers within old high dike systems use the most pesticide per hectare and farmers under low dike systems use the least 23 less pesticides than farmers in old high dike systems farmers under new high dikes use 15 less pesticide compared to farmers under old high dike systems 4 potential implications of results 4 1 implications for rice farmer income temporal development of rice farmer income was estimated based on the regression results for several characteristic farmer types these represent typical smallholder and large scale farming households in the three different dike systems due to an increase in fertiliser application rice farms of all sizes and within different dike systems are thus far able to increase their yields and income incomes of low dike farmers is highest in the first season fig 3a because of less input requirements interestingly the income of smallholders increases over time in low dike systems but this stabilises under old high dike systems due to higher amounts of input required as a result of three rice seasons annual rice farmer income is highest within old high dike systems for all years and farm sizes but substantially lower within new high dike systems fig 3b despite requiring less fertiliser to achieve their yields in our calculations annual income remains lowest in low dike systems after eight years as the outcomes only show two seasons of rice revenues however it can be expected that rice farmers in low dike systems utilise the third flood season for alternative flood based livelihoods or off farm seasonal incomes tran et al 2018b which is not included in our annual calculations thus the most relevant comparison between the dike systems is presented in fig 3a and c a striking difference in the slope of the lines depicting income indicates a steady and equal increase of income for both a smallholder and large scale farmer under a low dike system while the income growth is less and more unequal for different farm sizes within high dike systems annual income growth is lowest for smallholder farmers within old high dike system which only experience limited income increases over time the small farm productivity advantage fan and chan kang 2005 is translated in higher incomes per unit of land however when accounting for an economies of scale factor to represent their better negotiation position initial income advantage per unit of land of smallholder farmers is overtaken by large scale farmers over time under high dike systems fig 3c and d the results indicate that changing from double rice cropping in a low dike system to triple rice cropping in a new high dike system pays off at first due to the income increases of an additional rice crop however this does not consider other income sources for double rice farmers in the third season furthermore the effect wears off over time for the smallholder farmer the gap between a low and new high dike income diminishes rapidly for the smallholder farmer per unit of land 4 2 impact of flood protection on farmer income besides enabling different farming systems the primary benefit of dikes is flood protection and thus safeguarding farmer livelihood and income yet flood risk cannot be prevented completely this section examines to what extent flood risk impacts farm income within low and high dike areas flood risk in high dike areas is mainly caused by dike overtopping or breaches in the flooding season the amount of damage depends on the flood event and moment of the peak flood as both the second and third crop are potentially damaged with early floods that typically inundate the area for 2 5 months farmers in low dike areas can be affected by floods when they occur early and partially or fully damage the second crop yields the resulting annual flood risk is 0 017 for double rice farmers thus on average double rice farmers lose 1 7 of their second crop yields table 8 for triple rice farmers the annual flood risk is 0 035 thus on average 3 5 of second and third rice yield is lost due to flood risks this difference can be ascribed to the relatively large extent of areas that are likely to get flooded because of dike overtopping in the flooding period these results imply a slightly higher average annual rice income loss for farmers in high dike areas compared to in low dike areas which marginally improves the cost benefit analysis for double rice farming compared to triple rice farming note however that the results are aggregated over the total study area for specific locations and individual farmers the impact can devastating 4 3 stalling rice yields our results show a steady yield growth under all dike systems as a result of increased inputs the fact that increased inputs still result in higher productivity albeit more inefficiently under high dike systems has been the primary driver of growing farm income in the surveyed period of 2008 2015 however many studies suggest that decreased soil fertility due to rice intensification eventually impedes yield growth binh et al 2022 hui et al 2022 tran et al 2021 2018b to examine this we assessed the average winter spring spring autumn 2nd season and autumn winter 3rd season rice yields at the commune level in dong thap and an giang province in the period 2000 2018 this data was collected from the statistical yearbooks of the department of agriculture and natural resources dard as registered by the vietnam statistical office gso 2020 and refers to the most detailed administrative level in vietnam this data sketches the broader local context in which farmers make their decisions it furthermore allows us to validate and compare the trends based on the productivity of the individual farmers sampled in the various surveys we included in our analysis with aggregate averaged outcomes fig 4 shows a steady productivity growth of all seasons continuing until roughly 2011 2012 after which yields show signs of a stabilisation and for some communes even a slight decline in recent years we expect however that the decline in 2016 and 2017 was primarily caused by the extreme drought in winter spring of 2015 2016 nguyen 2017 therefore we make the modest assumption that yield growth has stagnated to test this hypothesis we perform district fixed effects ols regression analysis comparing commune average two year yields with yields in the first period 2000 2001 this approach corrects for structural differences between regions and highlights the temporal trend as table 9 shows yields increased steadily from 2002 to 2003 until 2008 2009 for all rice seasons after which productivity growth continues at a slower pace peak levels are reached in the years 2014 2015 after which yield levels stabilise this reinforces the findings in section 3 2 between the period 2008 and 2015 farmers still experienced productivity growth hence it was not just the sampled farmers who witnessed their yields go up but also their neighbours in the community this may well explain the reluctance to adapt their farming strategies as was concluded from the mota survey the stalling rice yields since 2015 may however gradually change this perception and increase their willingness to adopt to other farming practices or find alternative income sources 5 discussion 5 1 reflections on key findings numerous studies indicate the negative long term environmental and economic costs of high dike development and rice intensification in the upper mekong delta chapman et al 2016 käkönen 2008 tong and clarke 2019 tran et al 2018b van staveren et al 2017 yuen et al 2021 the government of vietnam increasingly acknowledges the adverse effect and is committed to transform the agricultural sector by promoting a transition to a controlled flooding system which uses low dikes and more sustainable flood based farming systems gov 2017 however paramount for a successful transition is the motivation and capability of local farmers to adopt the proposed alternative systems nguyen et al 2019 smajgl et al 2015 despite the acknowledged disadvantages of high dike systems and long term benefits of flood compatible farming systems our survey results showed that the ability and willingness of rice farmers in the upper mekong delta to transition to flood based farming systems was still relatively low in 2015 almost two thirds of farmers preferred continuing and intensifying rice cultivation as they expected rice farming practices to remain economically sustainable in the long term this is in line with a study from tran and weger 2018 in which farmers indicated they preferred intensifying their rice cultivation they also indicated a lack of financial and technical ability as key barriers to adopt new farming practices these findings are in agreement with similar studies in the mekong delta which show that prime reasons not to adopt alternative farming are insufficient skills contentment with current practices and lack of investment capacity at the household level nguyen et al 2019 smajgl et al 2015 tran et al 2021 at the same time most farmers do express concern about environmental impacts of intensive rice cropping systems in particular soil fertility decreases and freshwater depletion recent studies show that these concerns have increased in recent years and that the appreciation of flood based alternatives is on the rise hui et al 2022 lan and van kien 2021 tran et al 2021 yuen et al 2021 our study shows that during the study period until 2015 rice yields were consistently increasing under both low and high dike systems as a result of increased fertiliser use and technological enhancements increasing yields and thus higher revenues were compensating for rising input costs due to higher levels of agrochemicals used in high dike systems thus farmers under high dike systems did not experience the negative economic consequences to the extent that it incentivized them to change farming practices the economic incentive as dominant motivator for preferring environmentally unsustainable farming systems is also found in a recent study by luu et al 2022 that show that high dike development flood changes and livelihood transformations happen in an ad hoc manner that is principally motivated by economic gains at the same time we find that the input efficiency of farmers in old high dike areas is considerably lower compared to new high dike and low dike areas in old high dike areas the effect of adding additional fertiliser to the system is only marginally contributing to additional yield implying that the soil quality has suffered as a result of years of intensive rice cultivation although the input efficiency yield to fertiliser is still relatively high in the early years of high dike construction this rapidly decreases over time to the level of older high dikes while it remains relatively stable for farmers in low dike areas this is in line with findings of tran et al 2019 that show lower profit margins for old high dikes compared to farmers in recently constructed new high dike systems this posits a risk to the income levels of farmers in high dike areas as declining crop biophysical suitability can only marginally be compensated by adding agrochemicals to the system another key outcome of the analysis is the unequal evolution of rice farmer income for smallholder 1 ha farmers compared to large scale farmers in high dike areas whereas the income of a large scale rice farmer increases steadily in high dike systems the income growth of a smallholder farmer is much slower the dampening effect on rice farmer income due to increased input requirements makes smallholders in high dike systems particularly vulnerable to changing conditions with increasing input requirements the incomes of smallholders is increasingly marginalised while they are also considered to be less resilient to future fertiliser price spikes chapman and darby 2016 a recent study of tran et al 2021 indicate that rice farmers are constantly prone to poverty due to the lack of power to negotiate over prices this causes many to fall into cycles of indebtedness which forces some farmers to sell their land to large corporates and triggers migration this process of out migration is further accelerated by widespread adoption of agricultural mechanisation and the reduction of opportunities to collect aquatic flood based resources which increases inequalities in farmer income in high dike systems tran 2019 the alternative flood based farming systems are aimed at contributing to a more environmentally and economically sustainable agricultural delta development however results of this study show some of the mechanisms why adoption of these systems is challenging as long as rice productivity increases annually as a result of technological enhancements and increased inputs the negative consequences of more input requirements is dampened as rice farm income continues to grow this was the case in our study period 2008 2015 our analysis of yield developments at commune level reveals that yield growth has slowed down in the past decade see table 8 this opens a window of opportunity for alternative more sustainable flood based system dang et al 2021 lan and van kien 2021 recent evidence of this is also confirmed by a study of tran et al 2021 that finds an increased appreciation of the 3 3 2 rice system in 2019 compared to 2015 other studies find that nature based agriculture and organic farming models are becoming more established in the mekong delta with more wide spread support lan and van kien 2021 this is also due to better economic perspectives for flood based crops dang et al 2021 the notable fall in triple rice crop area between 2016 and 2019 in an giang province emphasises this development hui et al 2022 although smallholder farmers are the first to experience the negative consequences of stalling yields under triple rice cultivation they indicate a lack of financial and technical capability to transfer table 5 this is recently confirmed by a study of tran et al 2021 that reports technologies skills and initial investment costs as prime constraints to adopt flood based crops despite improved circumstances for flood based alternatives the adoption rate will remain low if different farmer groups are not effectively targeted smallholders are most helped if their financial and technical capability is improved while large scale farmers would be more receptive to opportunities to maximise their profitability by clear and certain cost benefit analyses of the alternative systems this thus requires more tailor made policy efforts for different farmer groups 5 2 limitations and future outlooks this study combines the output of several surveys undertaken in the period 2008 2015 perceptions and circumstances are likely to change certainly in view of the stalling yields we observe at communal level this is likely to increases support for more sustainable farming systems in the area as is described in recent literature dang et al 2021 hui et al 2022 lan and van kien 2021 it is therefore recommended to conduct new surveys to analyse how farmers respond to these changing conditions and how that affects their willingness to adapt to alternative farming practices this study focuses on the evolution of yields and fertiliser of the first rice crop with the assumption that effects are similar for the second and third crop in future research it would be interesting to explore these crops separately to investigate whether these crops are affected differently furthermore in our annual income calculation we exclude potential additional activities of double crop farmers in the flood season due to the wide variety of possible alternatives which potentially underestimates our annual income for low dike farmers this could be further explored in future studies to get a complete picture of total annual agricultural incomes this study focused on the upper mekong delta region it would also be interesting to focus on impacts of higher salinity levels on farmer income and livelihoods for the middle and coastal area caused by combined effects of sea level rise and subsidence as a result of unsustainable groundwater abstraction and upstream dam and dike developments farmer responses to these impacts particularly with respect to out migration and adoption of sustainable farming models are likely to differ depending on different farm profiles determining their abilities and motivations further research might help in understanding why certain farmers are more reluctant or able to switch to other practices or why they might opt to leave the agricultural sector in combination with more research to assess the local variation in cost benefits of alternative farming systems this may help the government in deciding which instruments enable farmers in certain locations to switch to alternative more climate resilient systems a key reason mentioned by farmers to switch to high dikes is that it offers better flood protection huu 2011 kien 2014 renaud and kuenzer 2012 sakamoto et al 2009b tran et al 2018b however triple rice farmers on average still have a higher flood risk due to the higher annual flood risk for the third crop due to dike overtopping and breaches in this study we averaged annual flood risk over space leading to only a minor flood risk however some areas are much more flood prone than others including the spatial variation in flood risk in future research of rice farmer income would be interesting also besides flood safety and higher farmer incomes high dikes also provide additional benefits to farmers such as a better connectivity to markets as roads are oftentimes constructed on top of the dikes the absence of yearly floods also enables wealthier farmers to invest in perennial crops fruits and vegetables that require high investment costs or to raise poultry or cattle tran and weger 2018 once a critical mass is reached there will be minimal incentive to regain to seasonal flooding creating a locked in situation luu et al 2022 these additional activities also add to the expected annual damage so future studies would benefit from including these elements 6 conclusions this study makes use of different survey datasets to assess a key driver behind local farmer s motivation to pursue intensive rice cultivation economic sustainability based on our analysis we conclude that a majority of the rice farmers 66 perceived triple rice cultivation as economically sustainable in the short term although many rice farmers recognise the environmental unsustainability of this model their preference for a stable income hampers large scale transitioning to more sustainable flood based alternative farming models our regression analysis supports this finding and shows that income continues to grow under high dike systems as yield growth compensates for higher input requirements this confirms the suggestion that economic incentives remain the most dominant motivator for preferring a certain farming system during our survey period the economic viability of triple rice was sustained due to a steady increase in rice productivity over time our commune level analysis shows that this is no longer self evident which opens a window of opportunity for more environmentally sustainable farming models we also found that income growth is unequally distributed between smallholders and large scale farmers under high dike systems due to increased input requirements and lower negotiation power of smallholders at the same time smallholders lack investment and technological ability to transition this makes smallholder farmers a key priority target group to offer supported strategies to make alternative farming systems economically viable declaration of competing interest the

9163,china s rapid population growth has inevitably led to a need for cropland expansion to meet food security challenges in arid regions such an expansion is restricted by limited water resources and

cropland could ensure that wue a e could be maintained at a higher level among the different cropland transformation types the impact of cropland change on wue a e was essentially determined by shifting correlations between gpp and et c act this correlation was weakened when the water supply increased heightening the negative impact of et c act on wue a e while weakening the positive impact of gpp on wue a e there was a tradeoff point for the level of irrigation between improving wue a e and crop yield suitable water saving irrigation is crucial to maintaining a relatively high level of wue a e yet not decreasing crop yield water saving irrigation in the shiyang river basin was deemed to have limited potential whereas in the shule river and heihe river basins there remains some potential for such irrigation the present study s results can potentially inform agricultural water and land management in the region and provide the basis for efficient water resources utilization

forecast wue under future climate change scenarios ma et al 2019b zhu et al 2011 there are numerous studies on the mechanisms involved in wue s temporal and spatial variation driving forces and attribution in different land covers or ecosystems however the impact of land use cover change lucc on variation in wue has seldom been identified especially in the context of cropland change cropland change is a type of lucc directly related to irrigation and agricultural management hu et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 by investigating the variation in wue a e for global croplands from 2000 to 2014 using modis data but not considering cropland changes ai et al 2020 found the wue a e in irrigated croplands to be lower than that of rain fed croplands liu et al 2021 found that agricultural productivity and water resource consumption increased with cropland expansion in asia from 2001 to 2018 compared to the original ecosystems studying the response of wue a e to cropland change is crucial for irrigation water management and associated agricultural practices especially in water limited regions with a climate controlled by the prevailing westerly winds and monsoon china s hexi corridor is a typical arid region consisting of a string of human made agricultural oases yang et al 2020 in this region annual precipitation is below 200 mm yr 1 and cropland irrigation relies heavily on streamflow from the northern portion of the qilian mountains feng et al 2019 while sufficient light heat and land resources allow this area to be an important grain production region wang et al 2021 threats imposed upon the region s water resources by current changes in climate have led to drought issues thereby restricting grain production and economic development niu et al 2018 the region s agroecosystems are very fragile limiting crop productivity and sustainable development in analyzing the response of wue a e to agricultural water management in a constantly cropped area of the hexi corridor s shiyang river basin tian et al 2020 the changes in cropland and the response of wue a e were not considered given its significant potential for carbon sequestration in an arid region this agroecosystem is one of the world s key terrestrial ecosystems zhou et al 2021 improving the carbon sequestration capacity of arid agricultural ecosystems under the conditions of water shortages and understanding the influence of cropland changes on water carbon interactions and its underlying mechanisms are crucial to increasing ecosystem water use efficiency and developing a rational artificial regulation of the structure and functions of arid agroecosystems to solve these issues and achieve more appropriate policy decisions for agricultural water and land management in the hexi corridor under climate change further investigations into wue a e and its response to cropland change are called for therefore the objectives in this study were to i investigate the cropland changes in the hexi corridor by using multi land use datasets and remote sensing images ii evaluate spatiotemporal variation of wue a e and its response to different types of cropland changes by employing gpp and et c act drawn from glass datasets and iii explore the impact of gpp et c act and the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi on wue a e and discuss the potential application of conclusions to agricultural water and land resources management for sustainable development 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area located in northwest china lat 37 17 42 48 n long 93 23 104 12 e the hexi corridor consists of a string of human made agricultural oases situated along a narrow passage between the northeast edge of the qinghai tibetan plateau and the badain jaran and tengger deserts fig 1 the hexi corridor is an important grain production region in china given the availability of light heat and land resources and is a typical arid region with precipitation below 200 mm yr 1 and potential evaporation above 2000 mm yr 1 these processes are alternately controlled by the prevailing westerly winds and china s southeast monsoon yang et al 2020 the oases of the hexi corridor are fed by runoff arising from ice and snow melt in the qilian mountains feng et al 2019 the oases occupy 10 of the hexi corridor support 85 of the region s population and contribute to more than 90 of the region s gross domestic product gdp feng et al 2015 due to the mismatch between the large water demand and limited supply groundwater has been extracted to supplement water resources and irrigate croplands over exploitation of groundwater has led to a drawdown of the water table and the destruction of the region s ecohydrological system resulting in serious ecological degradation in the hexi corridor oases feng et al 2015 studying cropland changes and their consequences to wue a e is therefore crucial to regulation of the structure and functions in this arid agroecosystem and in developing more appropriate policies for agricultural water and land management in the hexi corridor under climate change 2 2 data collection due to the patchy distribution of cropland in the hexi corridor it is necessary to use high spatial resolution data to capture the responses of ndvi gpp et c act and wue a e relative to cropland change the spatial resolution of most datasets in large scale studies is relatively low at 0 05 around 5 km which is not suitable for a cropland change response study we searched for datasets that covered the period 2000 2020 with the highest spatial resolution possible and we found that the ndvi et c act and gpp datasets were all higher than or equal to 1 km land use datasets at 5 year intervals from 2000 to 2020 at a spatial resolution of 1 km were drawn from the resource and environmental sciences and data center chinese academy of sciences resdc https www resdc cn these datasets based on landsat images and generated by human visual interpretation served to investigate the change in cropland use from 2000 to 2020 twenty five land use categories with classification accuracies exceeding 90 were distinguished li et al 2022 land use types in the hexi corridor were simplified into eight major categories woodland cropland water high cover grassland coverage above 50 medium cover grassland coverage between 20 and 50 low cover grassland coverage between 5 and 20 built up and unused land the 2000 2020 ndvi datasets were drawn from the mod13a2 v6 product using the google earth engine gee this dataset is referred to as the continuity index to the existing national oceanic and atmospheric administration advanced very high resolution radiometer noaa avhrr and derived ndvi at a spatial resolution of 1 km and a time span of 16 days we extracted the growing season ndvi by averaging semi monthly ndvi values from april to october the et c act datasets 2003 to present were collected from the et c act product of operational simplified surface energy balance ssebop at a spatial resolution of 1 km https earlywarning usgs gov the ssebop et c act products were based on the simplified surface energy balance sseb model with a new parameterization for operational application senay et al 2013 the ssebop model calculated et c act using modis and global data assimilation system gdas data and predefined boundary conditions that are unique to each pixel for the hot and cold reference conditions the ssebop model has been shown to be a reliable and robust method for large scale et c act estimation li and he 2020 xu et al 2019b compared to eddy covariance et c act data the ssebop et c act data can explain 86 of observed variability in the contiguous united states and performs best for cropland chen et al 2016 given its high spatial resolution this et c act dataset was selected for use in this study the growing season et c act was calculated by summing the monthly et c act data from april to october the 2000 2020 gpp data were drawn from global land surface satellite glass products at a spatial resolution of 500 m http www glass umd edu originating from the ec lue model eddy covariance light use efficiency the algorithm generating these data integrated the impacts of atmospheric co2 concentration radiation components and atmospheric water vapor pressure yuan et al 2010 this dataset s strong performance has been validated widely throughout north america europe and east asia indicating that it could accurately reproduce spatial and temporal variability across various ecosystems yang et al 2022a yuan et al 2019 we extracted the growing season gpp data by summing the monthly gpp data from april to october considering the temporal resolutions of the different dataset sources we selected 2003 2020 ndvi et c act and gpp data and interpolated data to a resolution of 1 km using the nearest neighbor resampling method hatami and nazemi 2022 2 3 statistical methods correlation analysis and trend detection methods widely used in the fields of hydrology and ecology were the main statistical methods employed pearson s correlation coefficient 1 0 r 1 0 served to detect the correlation between two variables where r 0 indicates a positive correlation exists between the two variables while r 0 indicates an inverse relationship li et al 2022 the sen s slope method was adopted to investigate the temporal variation of ndvi gpp et c act and wue a e in this study yang et al 2017 a 2 tailed hypothesis with p 0 05 indicated a significant test for pearson s correlation and sen s slope methods more details regarding these two methods were provided by sen 1968 yang et al 2017 and hou et al 2022 2 4 attribution of wuea e variation for cropland the wue a e is defined as the ratio of gpp to et c act therefore changes in wue a e can be attributed to the variations in gpp and et c act based on the simulation equation of wue a e its first order differential approximation in terms of time t can be expressed as wang et al 2020 yang et al 2022a 1 d wue a e dt wue a e gpp dgpp dt wue a e e t c a c t d et c act dt where d wue a e dt dgpp dt and d et c act dt represent the temporal variation of wue a e gpp and et c act respectively determined by the sen s slope method wue a e gpp and w u e a e e t c a c t represent the first order partial derivatives of wue a e with respect to gpp and et c act respectively according to the elasticity based method in the contribution calculation eq 1 can be further expressed as yang et al 2022a 2 d wue a e dt ε gpp wue a e gpp dgpp dt ε et c act wue a e et c act d et c act dt where ε gpp and ε et c act represent the elasticity coefficient of wue a e to gpp and etc act respectively wue a e gpp and et c act represent the mean values of its corresponding series the elasticity coefficient can be estimated by the partial correlation coefficient and coefficients of variation of wue a e gpp and et c act and is expressed as yang et al 2022b 3 ε x wue a e x wue a e x i x wue a e i wue a e x i x 2 ρ x wue a e y cv wuea e cv x where x represents the driving factor gpp or et c act in this study cv x and cv wuea e represent the coefficient of the variation of x and wue a e ρ x wuea e y represents the partial correlation coefficient between x and wue a e in considering the effect of the other factor y it can be estimated as yang et al 2022b 4 ρ x wue a e y ρ x wue a e ρ x y ρ y wue a e 1 ρ x y 2 1 ρ y wue a e 2 where ρ x wue a e and ρ y wue a e represent the correlation coefficient of wue a e with x and y and ρ x y represents the correlation coefficient of x and y representing the sum of individual contributions of gpp c gpp and et c act c et c act to variation in wue a e eq 2 can be simplified to 5 d wue a e dt c gpp c et c act the relative contributions of gpp and et c act to wue a e variation can therefore be estimated as yang et al 2022a 6a r gpp c gpp c gpp c et c act 100 6b r et c act c et c act c gpp c et c act 100 where r gpp and r et c act represent respectively the relative contribution of gpp and et c act to variation in wue a e 3 results 3 1 changes in agricultural land use the distribution of land use cover types in the hexi corridor at 5 year intervals from 2000 to 2020 are illustrated in fig 2 a e in 2000 the two major land use types were unused land sandy land and bare land and low cover grasslands accounting for 67 0 and 14 3 of the hexi corridor s total expanse respectively this indicated an arid and fragile environment cropland was mainly distributed in the oases situated at elevations below 2400 m in 2000 cropland occupied 6 1 of the total expanse of the hexi corridor whereas in 2020 this proportion had risen to 7 0 about 90 0 of croplands were irrigated either from streamflow arising in the qilian mountains or local ground water the remaining 10 0 of cropland was rain fed and was largely distributed in the foothills of qilian mountains in the shiyang river basin woodlands and high and medium cover grasslands were mainly distributed in the qilian mountains and a small proportion serving as farm shelterbelts were distributed along ridges adjoining croplands over the past 20 years the areas of cropland water and built up land increased by 14 3 23 1 and 57 6 respectively the other five land use cover types remained within 2 0 with the expanse of woodlands low cover grasslands and unused lands decreasing while high and medium cover grasslands increased the net changes in cropland represented the combination of cropland transferred in and out the distribution of cropland transformations within the hexi corridor during 2000 2020 are illustrated in fig 2f it should be noted that there were about 150 km² of cropland which went through several rounds of changes first transferred out then transferred in and vice versa between 2000 and 2020 in order to avoid unnecessary error we removed these croplands and only counted the cropland with consistent change during 2000 2020 an area of 12 387 km² of cropland remained constant cl 0 representing roughly 90 0 of total cropland in the hexi corridor table 1 the area of cropland that shifted to other land uses was only 326 km² accounting for roughly 2 5 of total cropland in 2000 these mainly shifted out cl to low cover grassland and unused land especially when the grains for green project was implemented over the same period some 1588 km² of land mostly from low cover grasslands and unused lands were shifted into cropland cl i e transferred in accounting for 12 3 of total cropland in 2000 the greater portion of cropland transformations both in and out occurred on the edges of oases whereas little cropland within the oases shifted to other land uses largely due to infrastructure and efforts to produce artificial green lands cropland transformation patterns differed significantly across the hexi corridor s three river basins fig 3 over the 20 years the area of cropland in all three river basins increased i e the area of cl was larger than that of cl among the three river basins the net increase in cropland area in the shule river basin was 406 km² accounting for 25 4 of total cropland in the basin in 2020 and least in the shiyang river basin with 221 km² only accounting for 3 5 of total cropland in its basin the largest net increase in cropland occurred in the heihe river basin with a net transferred area of 635 km² from 2000 to 2020 which accounted for 11 0 of total cropland in heihe river basin in 2020 3 2 response of ndvi e t c a c t and gpp to cropland change cropland transformations lead to shifts in vegetation irrigation and management which result in changes in ndvi et c act and gpp the distributions of mean growing season ndvi et c act and gpp in the hexi corridor present a spatial heterogeneity of cropland transformations in the different river basins fig 4 the range of the mean growing season ndvi in the hexi corridor s cropland areas varied between 0 and 0 64 with high values mainly occurring in cl 0 areas the mean growing season ndvi for cl 0 areas in the shule heihe and shiyang river basins were 0 30 0 09 0 34 0 09 and 0 32 0 09 while for cl they were 0 23 0 08 0 25 0 10 and 0 24 0 09 respectively for all three river basins the mean growing season ndvi for cl and cl areas were less than that in cl 0 areas and the mean ndvi in cl areas was smaller than that for cl areas the mean overall growing season et c act varied from 50 to 747 mm exhibiting significant spatial heterogeneity in the cropland areas of the hexi corridor during 2003 2020 fig 4b the mean overall growing season et c act in the cl 0 areas of the shule heihe and shiyang river basins were 398 68 167 93 mm 395 72 160 32 mm and 375 47 149 34 mm whereas for cl areas they were 265 49 158 96 mm 273 01 165 95 mm and 284 56 132 96 mm and for cl were 355 15 192 36 mm 372 54 153 25 mm and 267 01 129 40 mm respectively similar to ndvi and for all three river basins the growing season et c act in cl 0 regions was higher than that in cl or cl areas moreover the growing season et c act for cl areas was larger than that for cl areas except for the shiyang river basin between 2003 and 2020 the mean overall growing season gpp varied from 0 to 900 g c m 2 in the hexi corridor croplands with a spatial heterogeneity similar to that of ndvi fig 4c the growing season gpp for the cl 0 areas in the shule heihe and shiyang river basins were 306 92 120 42 481 08 179 99 and 439 46 175 73 g c m 2 while for cl areas they were 208 96 116 65 296 9 185 41 and 259 72 180 58 g c m 2 and for cl areas 231 36 143 78 435 08 159 40 and 439 92 200 35 g c m 2 respectively among the three cropland transformation types and for all the three river basins the growing season gpp was lowest for cl areas and highest in the cl 0 areas from the time series of mean growing season ndvi et c act and gpp for the three river basins in 2003 and 2020 fig 5 we can see the mean ndvi and gpp increased significantly across the three types of cropland areas in all basins except for the cl 0 in shiyang river basin with an insignificant increasing trend in gpp and a decreasing trend in ndvi and gpp for the cl in heihe river basin table 2 the upward trends in mean ndvi and gpp in the cl areas were significantly greater than those in cl areas for all three river basins this may reflect different irrigation and field management approaches applied to areas of cropland being transferred in and out of the three river basins compared with cl areas the cl areas would require additional irrigation and field management this would then lead to an increase in ndvi and gpp in the three basins the variation of growing season et c act for the cl 0 areas in the three river basins was significantly different reflecting the different water resources management protocols and implementation of water saving irrigation in the basins at 1 11 mm yr 1 and 0 29 mm yr 1 respectively the changes in growing season et c act for the cl 0 areas in the shule and heihe river basins were not significant whereas in the shiyang river basin a declining trend 2 38 mm yr 1 was found table 2 growing season et c act in the three river basins showed significant p 0 05 upward trends of 6 01 7 69 and 3 13 mm yr 1 for the shule heihe and shiyang river basins respectively comparatively for the cl areas the rates of change in growing season et c act were lower than those in cl areas for all three river basins and even negative in the cl areas of heihe river basin 3 3 response of w u e a e to cropland change variations in ndvi et c act and gpp due to cropland transformation led to changes in wue a e fig 6 shows the response of mean growing season wue a e to cropland transformations in the hexi corridor in the three river basins wue a e was highest in the cl areas vs cl and cl 0 areas except in the shule river basin with values of 0 86 0 64 1 68 1 59 and 2 14 1 35 g c kg h2o for the shule heihe and shiyang river basins respectively the cl areas showed the smallest wue a e among the three cropland transformation types except in the shule river basin where it was the highest 1 06 1 45 1 46 1 40 and 1 21 1 44 g c kg h2o for the shule heihe and shiyang river basins respectively across all three cropland transformation types the wue a e in shule river basin was the lowest among the basins fig 6 under the different cropland transformations the variation trends in wue a e for the cl areas were generally smaller than those of cl 0 or cl areas especially in shule river basin fig 7 table 2 for all basins the annual variation in growing season wue a e was largest in the cl areas with significantly increasing trends of 2 78 10 2 2 48 10 2 and 2 14 10 2 g c kg 1 h2o yr 1 in the shule heihe and shiyang river basins respectively the trends of growing season wue a e in the cl 0 areas were larger than those in the cl areas for all basins this indicates that irrigation and field management could ensure that the wue a e in cl 0 areas could be maintained at a stable level thereby reducing the risk of a reduction in grain yield due to adverse impacts such as drought 4 discussion 4 1 impact of cropland change on ndvi gpp e t c a c t and w u e a e a change in cropland type means changes in land cover e g vegetation type soil properties e g soil fertility and human activities e g irrigation and field management all of which can potentially have an impact on wue a e in an arid region such as the hexi corridor a shortage of water is the primary but not only limitation to vegetative growth although irrigation was applied to cl areas the growing season ndvi and gpp both decreased compared to cl 0 areas fig 8 this finding is consistent with liu et al 2021 who reported that globally newly expanded croplands led to decrease in net primary productivity npp and et c act with respect to the original agroecosystems two things may explain this i the spatial resolution was not sufficiently small for example a pixel assigned the category cropland may be thus identified because the largest proportion of land within the pixel falls in the cropland category although other land use types are present at significant levels or the value of a pixel s land use variable may represent an average of the different land use types within the pixel ai et al 2020 ii water saving irrigation was preferentially adopted in the cl areas while conventional irrigation was the main form of irrigation in the cl 0 areas et c act can to some extent reflect the water supply and we observed that the et c act was lower in the cl areas compared to cl 0 areas unlike cl or cl 0 areas cl areas seldom received irrigation and vegetation often shifted into natural vegetation or buildings were constructed on the land therefore the ndvi gpp and et c act were lower in cl areas compared to cl 0 areas compared to the cl 0 areas the means of growing season ndvi gpp and et c act were all lower in both cl and cl areas particularly in cl areas fig 8 the wue a e was also generally lower except for the slight increase in the cl areas of the shule river basin and an obvious increase in the cl areas of shiyang river however from fig 9 one can see that with the exception of the shiyang river basin the correlations of et c act with ndvi and gpp were significantly greater in cl than cl areas this indicated that the variation in gpp in cl areas was less sensitive to et c act this further suggested that water resources were not the only factor having an impact on the variation of gpp in the cl areas plants would be able to adapt their water use strategies during periods of water insufficiency by improving their wue a e or having fewer non productive water losses through evaporation groh et al 2020 zhang et al 2015 for the three river basins in cl 0 areas under sufficient irrigation the significant correlations of et c act with gpp were equivalent to or lower than those in cl areas therefore it can be inferred that the sensitivity of gpp to et c act would decrease along with an increase in water supply since et c act is made up of transpiration t from vegetation and evaporation e from soil t is directly connected with the productivity of vegetation wang et al 2021 theoretically if all water loss occurred through transpiration et c act t a strong correlation between gpp and et c act would be expected as water supply increased the proportion of t to et c act would be decreased liu et al 2022 tian et al 2013 and accordingly the sensitivity of gpp to et c act would be weakened for the three different cropland transformation types the impact of cropland change on wue a e was the result of gpp and et c act i e it was essentially determined by the different relationships between gpp and et c act under different water supplies therefore the impacts of cropland change on wue a e in the three river basins were slightly different due to the location of areas of change in cropland as well as different irrigation and field management practices resulting in different relationships between gpp and et c act fig 10 generally for the hexi corridor an increase in water supply caused the correlation between gpp and et c act to weaken the negative impact of et c act on wue a e to strengthen and the positive impact of gpp on wue a e to weaken 4 2 contribution of e t c a c t and gpp to variation in w u e a e although there were different sensitivities of wue a e to gpp and et c act under different cropland transformation types the contribution of gpp and et c act to wue a e was the synthetical result of their sensitivity to wue a e as well as their magnitudes of variation wang et al 2020 the contribution of gpp to the variation in wue a e for the three cropland transformation types in the three river basins fig 10 varied from 56 90 while the contribution of et c act to wue a e variation varied from 47 42 the absolute contributions of gpp were larger than that of etc ac t indicating that the gpp dominated the variation of wue a e in the hexi corridor s croplands the positive contribution of gpp to wue a e variation in areas within the heihe river basin s cl areas was attributable to a positive correlation between gpp and wue a e under a decreasing gpp variation in contrast the positive contribution of et c act to wue a e variation in cl 0 areas of the shiyang river basin and in cl areas of the heihe river basin was the result of decreasing et c act combined with a negative correlation between et c act and wue a e fig 9 yang et al 2022a analyzed the contribution of gpp and et c act to variations in wue a e in croplands in northwest china by using an attribution method and confirmed the dominant role of gpp in terms of its impact on the variation of cropland wue a e 4 3 applications to agricultural water and land management farmers or local agricultural managers tend to irrigate more during the growing season in order to improve both the wue a e and crop yield however there exists a tradeoff between improvements in wue a e and crop yield with irrigation qiu et al 2008 found that et c act significantly increased when the frequency and depth of irrigation water increased within a growing season such that the wue a e generally decreased and grain yield did not increase therefore deficit irrigation is most appropriate for the areas where precipitation during the growing season is less than 200 mm yu et al 2020 and a suitable irrigation regime is more likely to achieve relatively greater levels of wue a e and crop yield li and wang 2021 for example in order to achieve sustainable regional water resources development irrigation and water conserving cropland management were implemented in the hexi corridor tian et al 2020 according to data from gansu province s report of water resources bulletin hbgp 2020 the irrigation quota presented a decreasing trend over the last 20 years while the cwp crop water productivity defined as the ratio of crop yield to irrigation water increased in all three river basins fig 11 it is consistent in our findings that the wue a e increased in the three cropland transformation types in the three river basins from 2003 to 2020 figs 6 and 9 however the crop yield did not always increase along with the increasing cwp from the correlation between cwp and crop yield in the three river basins of hexi corridor fig 12 we can see that crop yield increased with increasing cwp in the shule and heihe river basins while the crop yield first increased then decreased with increasing cwp in the shiyang river basin this indicated there was a threshold level of water conserving irrigation above which crop yield would be decreased therefore comparison between conventional irrigation a suitable water saving irrigation or deficit irrigation is crucial for maintaining a relatively high cwp without reducing crop yield liu and song 2022 thus we can conclude that the water saving irrigation in the shiyang river basin was excessive and more water should be supplied to maintain a cwp around 0 8 kg m³ whereas in the shule and heihe river basins there remained water saving irrigation potential to improve the cwp future studies should focus on the determination of suitable irrigation levels for different crops under different field management practices 5 conclusions a crucial variable in accounting for biological productivity and water use wue a e is defined as the ratio of gpp to et c act at the agroecosystem scale studying the response of wue a e to agricultural land use change could facilitate the understanding of water carbon interactions and the application of effective cropland management and efficient water use protocols in agricultural areas under current climate change in the present study we investigated different transformations of cropland and evaluated wue a e response to these changes from 2003 2020 by studying gpp and et c act datasets for the three river basins of the hexi corridor the cropland in the hexi corridor increased overall with 2 5 of cropland transferred out and 12 3 of total cropland transferred in between 2003 and 2020 the growing season wue a e showed its highest variation in the areas of cropland transferred in with significant increasing trends of 2 78 10 2 2 48 10 2 and 2 14 10 2 g c kg 1 h2o yr 1 while variation for cl areas was the lowest with values of 0 55 10 2 0 16 10 2 and 1 10 10 2 g c kg 1 h2o yr 1 for the shule heihe and shiyang river basins respectively for all three river basins wue a e showed increasing trends under all three cropland transformation types the absolute contributions of gpp to wue a e were larger than that of et c act indicating the dominance of gpp in controlling the variation of wue a e in the hexi corridor s croplands the impact of cropland change on wue a e was determined by the different correlations between gpp and et c act among the cropland transformation types with an increase in water supply the correlation between gpp and et c act was weakened the negative impact of et c act on wue a e was strengthened and the positive impact of gpp on wue a e was weakened there was a tradeoff between improving wue a e and crop yield with irrigation suitable water saving irrigation is crucial for maintaining a high wue a e without reducing crop yield the water saving irrigation in shiyang river was excessive whereas there was still potential for water saving irrigation in the shule and heihe river basins the results of this study can be potentially applied in agricultural water and land management and efficient water resource utilization for sustainable development in arid regions

9163,china s rapid population growth has inevitably led to a need for cropland expansion to meet food security challenges in arid regions such an expansion is restricted by limited water resources and an increase in productivity per cropland area must be achieved while still limiting water use however the response of agroecosystem water use efficiency wue a e to alterations in cropland use in northwest china s hexi corridor has not been documented in any great detail this has limited our understanding of the region s water carbon interactions and in particular how effective cropland management and efficient water utilization protocols might be applied there the response of the region s wue a e to different potential shifts in cropland was evaluated by drawing on growing season 2003 2020 gross primary productivity gpp and actual evapotranspiration et c act data over this period net cropland area increased with 12 3 of total cropland transferred in but only 2 5 of cropland transferred out the trend in growing season wue a e was greatest in cropland regions transferred in p 0 05 and lowest in the cropland transferred out indicating irrigation and field management in cropland could ensure that wue a e could be maintained at a higher level among the different cropland transformation types the impact of cropland change on wue a e was essentially determined by shifting correlations between gpp and et c act this correlation was weakened when the water supply increased heightening the negative impact of et c act on wue a e while weakening the positive impact of gpp on wue a e there was a tradeoff point for the level of irrigation between improving wue a e and crop yield suitable water saving irrigation is crucial to maintaining a relatively high level of wue a e yet not decreasing crop yield water saving irrigation in the shiyang river basin was deemed to have limited potential whereas in the shule river and heihe river basins there remains some potential for such irrigation the present study s results can potentially inform agricultural water and land management in the region and provide the basis for efficient water resources utilization

global climate change and rapid population growth have exposed human society to a serious food supply challenge feng et al 2019 tong et al 2016 to cope with food insecurity issues there is greater pressure to increase cropland productivity and expand cropland area to fulfill growing food demands ai et al 2020 from 2003 2019 global cropland area increased by 9 0 potapov et al 2022 while in china it increased by 2 5 from 2001 to 2015 lan et al 2021 these expansions have been limited by a dearth of water resources available under current agricultural practices yu et al 2020 as well as urbanization and industrialization zhao et al 2019 therefore productivity per unit cropland area must be enhanced and with as little additional water inputs as possible defined as the ratio of gross primary production gpp to actual evapotranspiration et c act at the ecosystem scale himanshu et al 2021 yang et al 2022a water use efficiency wue is a critical parameter in evaluating crop production and water resource consumption kumar jha et al 2019 wang et al 2018 however the response of agroecosystem water use efficiency wue a e to agricultural land use changes has been only sparsely documented to date limiting our understanding of water carbon interactions and the application of effective cropland management and efficient water resource utilization in agricultural areas under the current period of climate change field observations satellite remote sensing and multi process based models have allowed the investigation of wue at different scales and in different ecosystems brümmer et al 2012 xu et al 2019a zhu et al 2011 2015 at the field site scale investigators have employed eddy covariance ec observations to investigate the relationship between wue and crop stomatal conductance and leaf water potential jarvis and mcnaughton 1986 montaldo and oren 2016 such experiments have allowed for the identification of i the particular environmental factors controlling

forecast wue under future climate change scenarios ma et al 2019b zhu et al 2011 there are numerous studies on the mechanisms involved in wue s temporal and spatial variation driving forces and attribution in different land covers or ecosystems however the impact of land use cover change lucc on variation in wue has seldom been identified especially in the context of cropland change cropland change is a type of lucc directly related to irrigation and agricultural management hu et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 by investigating the variation in wue a e for global croplands from 2000 to 2014 using modis data but not considering cropland changes ai et al 2020 found the wue a e in irrigated croplands to be lower than that of rain fed croplands liu et al 2021 found that agricultural productivity and water resource consumption increased with cropland expansion in asia from 2001 to 2018 compared to the original ecosystems studying the response of wue a e to cropland change is crucial for irrigation water management and associated agricultural practices especially in water limited regions with a climate controlled by the prevailing westerly winds and monsoon china s hexi corridor is a typical arid region consisting of a string of human made agricultural oases yang et al 2020 in this region annual precipitation is below 200 mm yr 1 and cropland irrigation relies heavily on streamflow from the northern portion of the qilian mountains feng et al 2019 while sufficient light heat and land resources allow this area to be an important grain production region wang et al 2021 threats imposed upon the region s water resources by current changes in climate have led to drought issues thereby restricting grain production and economic development niu et al 2018 the region s agroecosystems are very fragile limiting crop productivity and sustainable development in analyzing the response of wue a e to agricultural water management in a constantly cropped area of the hexi corridor s shiyang river basin tian et al 2020 the changes in cropland and the response of wue a e were not considered given its significant potential for carbon sequestration in an arid region this agroecosystem is one of the world s key terrestrial ecosystems zhou et al 2021 improving the carbon sequestration capacity of arid agricultural ecosystems under the conditions of water shortages and understanding the influence of cropland changes on water carbon interactions and its underlying mechanisms are crucial to increasing ecosystem water use efficiency and developing a rational artificial regulation of the structure and functions of arid agroecosystems to solve these issues and achieve more appropriate policy decisions for agricultural water and land management in the hexi corridor under climate change further investigations into wue a e and its response to cropland change are called for therefore the objectives in this study were to i investigate the cropland changes in the hexi corridor by using multi land use datasets and remote sensing images ii evaluate spatiotemporal variation of wue a e and its response to different types of cropland changes by employing gpp and et c act drawn from glass datasets and iii explore the impact of gpp et c act and the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi on wue a e and discuss the potential application of conclusions to agricultural water and land resources management for sustainable development 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area located in northwest china lat 37 17 42 48 n long 93 23 104 12 e the hexi corridor consists of a string of human made agricultural oases situated along a narrow passage between the northeast edge of the qinghai tibetan plateau and the badain jaran and tengger deserts fig 1 the hexi corridor is an important grain production region in china given the availability of light heat and land resources and is a typical arid region with precipitation below 200 mm yr 1 and potential evaporation above 2000 mm yr 1 these processes are alternately controlled by the prevailing westerly winds and china s southeast monsoon yang et al 2020 the oases of the hexi corridor are fed by runoff arising from ice and snow melt in the qilian mountains feng et al 2019 the oases occupy 10 of the hexi corridor support 85 of the region s population and contribute to more than 90 of the region s gross domestic product gdp feng et al 2015 due to the mismatch between the large water demand and limited supply groundwater has been extracted to supplement water resources and irrigate croplands over exploitation of groundwater has led to a drawdown of the water table and the destruction of the region s ecohydrological system resulting in serious ecological degradation in the hexi corridor oases feng et al 2015 studying cropland changes and their consequences to wue a e is therefore crucial to regulation of the structure and functions in this arid agroecosystem and in developing more appropriate policies for agricultural water and land management in the hexi corridor under climate change 2 2 data collection due to the patchy distribution of cropland in the hexi corridor it is necessary to use high spatial resolution data to capture the responses of ndvi gpp et c act and wue a e relative to cropland change the spatial resolution of most datasets in large scale studies is relatively low at 0 05 around 5 km which is not suitable for a cropland change response study we searched for datasets that covered the period 2000 2020 with the highest spatial resolution possible and we found that the ndvi et c act and gpp datasets were all higher than or equal to 1 km land use datasets at 5 year intervals from 2000 to 2020 at a spatial resolution of 1 km were drawn from the resource and environmental sciences and data center chinese academy of sciences resdc https www resdc cn these datasets based on landsat images and generated by human visual interpretation served to investigate the change in cropland use from 2000 to 2020 twenty five land use categories with classification accuracies exceeding 90 were distinguished li et al 2022 land use types in the hexi corridor were simplified into eight major categories woodland cropland water high cover grassland coverage above 50 medium cover grassland coverage between 20 and 50 low cover grassland coverage between 5 and 20 built up and unused land the 2000 2020 ndvi datasets were drawn from the mod13a2 v6 product using the google earth engine gee this dataset is referred to as the continuity index to the existing national oceanic and atmospheric administration advanced very high resolution radiometer noaa avhrr and derived ndvi at a spatial resolution of 1 km and a time span of 16 days we extracted the growing season ndvi by averaging semi monthly ndvi values from april to october the et c act datasets 2003 to present were collected from the et c act product of operational simplified surface energy balance ssebop at a spatial resolution of 1 km https earlywarning usgs gov the ssebop et c act products were based on the simplified surface energy balance sseb model with a new parameterization for operational application senay et al 2013 the ssebop model calculated et c act using modis and global data assimilation system gdas data and predefined boundary conditions that are unique to each pixel for the hot and cold reference conditions the ssebop model has been shown to be a reliable and robust method for large scale et c act estimation li and he 2020 xu et al 2019b compared to eddy covariance et c act data the ssebop et c act data can explain 86 of observed variability in the contiguous united states and performs best for cropland chen et al 2016 given its high spatial resolution this et c act dataset was selected for use in this study the growing season et c act was calculated by summing the monthly et c act data from april to october the 2000 2020 gpp data were drawn from global land surface satellite glass products at a spatial resolution of 500 m http www glass umd edu originating from the ec lue model eddy covariance light use efficiency the algorithm generating these data integrated the impacts of atmospheric co2 concentration radiation components and atmospheric water vapor pressure yuan et al 2010 this dataset s strong performance has been validated widely throughout north america europe and east asia indicating that it could accurately reproduce spatial and temporal variability across various ecosystems yang et al 2022a yuan et al 2019 we extracted the growing season gpp data by summing the monthly gpp data from april to october considering the temporal resolutions of the different dataset sources we selected 2003 2020 ndvi et c act and gpp data and interpolated data to a resolution of 1 km using the nearest neighbor resampling method hatami and nazemi 2022 2 3 statistical methods correlation analysis and trend detection methods widely used in the fields of hydrology and ecology were the main statistical methods employed pearson s correlation coefficient 1 0 r 1 0 served to detect the correlation between two variables where r 0 indicates a positive correlation exists between the two variables while r 0 indicates an inverse relationship li et al 2022 the sen s slope method was adopted to investigate the temporal variation of ndvi gpp et c act and wue a e in this study yang et al 2017 a 2 tailed hypothesis with p 0 05 indicated a significant test for pearson s correlation and sen s slope methods more details regarding these two methods were provided by sen 1968 yang et al 2017 and hou et al 2022 2 4 attribution of wuea e variation for cropland the wue a e is defined as the ratio of gpp to et c act therefore changes in wue a e can be attributed to the variations in gpp and et c act based on the simulation equation of wue a e its first order differential approximation in terms of time t can be expressed as wang et al 2020 yang et al 2022a 1 d wue a e dt wue a e gpp dgpp dt wue a e e t c a c t d et c act dt where d wue a e dt dgpp dt and d et c act dt represent the temporal variation of wue a e gpp and et c act respectively determined by the sen s slope method wue a e gpp and w u e a e e t c a c t represent the first order partial derivatives of wue a e with respect to gpp and et c act respectively according to the elasticity based method in the contribution calculation eq 1 can be further expressed as yang et al 2022a 2 d wue a e dt ε gpp wue a e gpp dgpp dt ε et c act wue a e et c act d et c act dt where ε gpp and ε et c act represent the elasticity coefficient of wue a e to gpp and etc act respectively wue a e gpp and et c act represent the mean values of its corresponding series the elasticity coefficient can be estimated by the partial correlation coefficient and coefficients of variation of wue a e gpp and et c act and is expressed as yang et al 2022b 3 ε x wue a e x wue a e x i x wue a e i wue a e x i x 2 ρ x wue a e y cv wuea e cv x where x represents the driving factor gpp or et c act in this study cv x and cv wuea e represent the coefficient of the variation of x and wue a e ρ x wuea e y represents the partial correlation coefficient between x and wue a e in considering the effect of the other factor y it can be estimated as yang et al 2022b 4 ρ x wue a e y ρ x wue a e ρ x y ρ y wue a e 1 ρ x y 2 1 ρ y wue a e 2 where ρ x wue a e and ρ y wue a e represent the correlation coefficient of wue a e with x and y and ρ x y represents the correlation coefficient of x and y representing the sum of individual contributions of gpp c gpp and et c act c et c act to variation in wue a e eq 2 can be simplified to 5 d wue a e dt c gpp c et c act the relative contributions of gpp and et c act to wue a e variation can therefore be estimated as yang et al 2022a 6a r gpp c gpp c gpp c et c act 100 6b r et c act c et c act c gpp c et c act 100 where r gpp and r et c act represent respectively the relative contribution of gpp and et c act to variation in wue a e 3 results 3 1 changes in agricultural land use the distribution of land use cover types in the hexi corridor at 5 year intervals from 2000 to 2020 are illustrated in fig 2 a e in 2000 the two major land use types were unused land sandy land and bare land and low cover grasslands accounting for 67 0 and 14 3 of the hexi corridor s total expanse respectively this indicated an arid and fragile environment cropland was mainly distributed in the oases situated at elevations below 2400 m in 2000 cropland occupied 6 1 of the total expanse of the hexi corridor whereas in 2020 this proportion had risen to 7 0 about 90 0 of croplands were irrigated either from streamflow arising in the qilian mountains or local ground water the remaining 10 0 of cropland was rain fed and was largely distributed in the foothills of qilian mountains in the shiyang river basin woodlands and high and medium cover grasslands were mainly distributed in the qilian mountains and a small proportion serving as farm shelterbelts were distributed along ridges adjoining croplands over the past 20 years the areas of cropland water and built up land increased by 14 3 23 1 and 57 6 respectively the other five land use cover types remained within 2 0 with the expanse of woodlands low cover grasslands and unused lands decreasing while high and medium cover grasslands increased the net changes in cropland represented the combination of cropland transferred in and out the distribution of cropland transformations within the hexi corridor during 2000 2020 are illustrated in fig 2f it should be noted that there were about 150 km² of cropland which went through several rounds of changes first transferred out then transferred in and vice versa between 2000 and 2020 in order to avoid unnecessary error we removed these croplands and only counted the cropland with consistent change during 2000 2020 an area of 12 387 km² of cropland remained constant cl 0 representing roughly 90 0 of total cropland in the hexi corridor table 1 the area of cropland that shifted to other land uses was only 326 km² accounting for roughly 2 5 of total cropland in 2000 these mainly shifted out cl to low cover grassland and unused land especially when the grains for green project was implemented over the same period some 1588 km² of land mostly from low cover grasslands and unused lands were shifted into cropland cl i e transferred in accounting for 12 3 of total cropland in 2000 the greater portion of cropland transformations both in and out occurred on the edges of oases whereas little cropland within the oases shifted to other land uses largely due to infrastructure and efforts to produce artificial green lands cropland transformation patterns differed significantly across the hexi corridor s three river basins fig 3 over the 20 years the area of cropland in all three river basins increased i e the area of cl was larger than that of cl among the three river basins the net increase in cropland area in the shule river basin was 406 km² accounting for 25 4 of total cropland in the basin in 2020 and least in the shiyang river basin with 221 km² only accounting for 3 5 of total cropland in its basin the largest net increase in cropland occurred in the heihe river basin with a net transferred area of 635 km² from 2000 to 2020 which accounted for 11 0 of total cropland in heihe river basin in 2020 3 2 response of ndvi e t c a c t and gpp to cropland change cropland transformations lead to shifts in vegetation irrigation and management which result in changes in ndvi et c act and gpp the distributions of mean growing season ndvi et c act and gpp in the hexi corridor present a spatial heterogeneity of cropland transformations in the different river basins fig 4 the range of the mean growing season ndvi in the hexi corridor s cropland areas varied between 0 and 0 64 with high values mainly occurring in cl 0 areas the mean growing season ndvi for cl 0 areas in the shule heihe and shiyang river basins were 0 30 0 09 0 34 0 09 and 0 32 0 09 while for cl they were 0 23 0 08 0 25 0 10 and 0 24 0 09 respectively for all three river basins the mean growing season ndvi for cl and cl areas were less than that in cl 0 areas and the mean ndvi in cl areas was smaller than that for cl areas the mean overall growing season et c act varied from 50 to 747 mm exhibiting significant spatial heterogeneity in the cropland areas of the hexi corridor during 2003 2020 fig 4b the mean overall growing season et c act in the cl 0 areas of the shule heihe and shiyang river basins were 398 68 167 93 mm 395 72 160 32 mm and 375 47 149 34 mm whereas for cl areas they were 265 49 158 96 mm 273 01 165 95 mm and 284 56 132 96 mm and for cl were 355 15 192 36 mm 372 54 153 25 mm and 267 01 129 40 mm respectively similar to ndvi and for all three river basins the growing season et c act in cl 0 regions was higher than that in cl or cl areas moreover the growing season et c act for cl areas was larger than that for cl areas except for the shiyang river basin between 2003 and 2020 the mean overall growing season gpp varied from 0 to 900 g c m 2 in the hexi corridor croplands with a spatial heterogeneity similar to that of ndvi fig 4c the growing season gpp for the cl 0 areas in the shule heihe and shiyang river basins were 306 92 120 42 481 08 179 99 and 439 46 175 73 g c m 2 while for cl areas they were 208 96 116 65 296 9 185 41 and 259 72 180 58 g c m 2 and for cl areas 231 36 143 78 435 08 159 40 and 439 92 200 35 g c m 2 respectively among the three cropland transformation types and for all the three river basins the growing season gpp was lowest for cl areas and highest in the cl 0 areas from the time series of mean growing season ndvi et c act and gpp for the three river basins in 2003 and 2020 fig 5 we can see the mean ndvi and gpp increased significantly across the three types of cropland areas in all basins except for the cl 0 in shiyang river basin with an insignificant increasing trend in gpp and a decreasing trend in ndvi and gpp for the cl in heihe river basin table 2 the upward trends in mean ndvi and gpp in the cl areas were significantly greater than those in cl areas for all three river basins this may reflect different irrigation and field management approaches applied to areas of cropland being transferred in and out of the three river basins compared with cl areas the cl areas would require additional irrigation and field management this would then lead to an increase in ndvi and gpp in the three basins the variation of growing season et c act for the cl 0 areas in the three river basins was significantly different reflecting the different water resources management protocols and implementation of water saving irrigation in the basins at 1 11 mm yr 1 and 0 29 mm yr 1 respectively the changes in growing season et c act for the cl 0 areas in the shule and heihe river basins were not significant whereas in the shiyang river basin a declining trend 2 38 mm yr 1 was found table 2 growing season et c act in the three river basins showed significant p 0 05 upward trends of 6 01 7 69 and 3 13 mm yr 1 for the shule heihe and shiyang river basins respectively comparatively for the cl areas the rates of change in growing season et c act were lower than those in cl areas for all three river basins and even negative in the cl areas of heihe river basin 3 3 response of w u e a e to cropland change variations in ndvi et c act and gpp due to cropland transformation led to changes in wue a e fig 6 shows the response of mean growing season wue a e to cropland transformations in the hexi corridor in the three river basins wue a e was highest in the cl areas vs cl and cl 0 areas except in the shule river basin with values of 0 86 0 64 1 68 1 59 and 2 14 1 35 g c kg h2o for the shule heihe and shiyang river basins respectively the cl areas showed the smallest wue a e among the three cropland transformation types except in the shule river basin where it was the highest 1 06 1 45 1 46 1 40 and 1 21 1 44 g c kg h2o for the shule heihe and shiyang river basins respectively across all three cropland transformation types the wue a e in shule river basin was the lowest among the basins fig 6 under the different cropland transformations the variation trends in wue a e for the cl areas were generally smaller than those of cl 0 or cl areas especially in shule river basin fig 7 table 2 for all basins the annual variation in growing season wue a e was largest in the cl areas with significantly increasing trends of 2 78 10 2 2 48 10 2 and 2 14 10 2 g c kg 1 h2o yr 1 in the shule heihe and shiyang river basins respectively the trends of growing season wue a e in the cl 0 areas were larger than those in the cl areas for all basins this indicates that irrigation and field management could ensure that the wue a e in cl 0 areas could be maintained at a stable level thereby reducing the risk of a reduction in grain yield due to adverse impacts such as drought 4 discussion 4 1 impact of cropland change on ndvi gpp e t c a c t and w u e a e a change in cropland type means changes in land cover e g vegetation type soil properties e g soil fertility and human activities e g irrigation and field management all of which can potentially have an impact on wue a e in an arid region such as the hexi corridor a shortage of water is the primary but not only limitation to vegetative growth although irrigation was applied to cl areas the growing season ndvi and gpp both decreased compared to cl 0 areas fig 8 this finding is consistent with liu et al 2021 who reported that globally newly expanded croplands led to decrease in net primary productivity npp and et c act with respect to the original agroecosystems two things may explain this i the spatial resolution was not sufficiently small for example a pixel assigned the category cropland may be thus identified because the largest proportion of land within the pixel falls in the cropland category although other land use types are present at significant levels or the value of a pixel s land use variable may represent an average of the different land use types within the pixel ai et al 2020 ii water saving irrigation was preferentially adopted in the cl areas while conventional irrigation was the main form of irrigation in the cl 0 areas et c act can to some extent reflect the water supply and we observed that the et c act was lower in the cl areas compared to cl 0 areas unlike cl or cl 0 areas cl areas seldom received irrigation and vegetation often shifted into natural vegetation or buildings were constructed on the land therefore the ndvi gpp and et c act were lower in cl areas compared to cl 0 areas compared to the cl 0 areas the means of growing season ndvi gpp and et c act were all lower in both cl and cl areas particularly in cl areas fig 8 the wue a e was also generally lower except for the slight increase in the cl areas of the shule river basin and an obvious increase in the cl areas of shiyang river however from fig 9 one can see that with the exception of the shiyang river basin the correlations of et c act with ndvi and gpp were significantly greater in cl than cl areas this indicated that the variation in gpp in cl areas was less sensitive to et c act this further suggested that water resources were not the only factor having an impact on the variation of gpp in the cl areas plants would be able to adapt their water use strategies during periods of water insufficiency by improving their wue a e or having fewer non productive water losses through evaporation groh et al 2020 zhang et al 2015 for the three river basins in cl 0 areas under sufficient irrigation the significant correlations of et c act with gpp were equivalent to or lower than those in cl areas therefore it can be inferred that the sensitivity of gpp to et c act would decrease along with an increase in water supply since et c act is made up of transpiration t from vegetation and evaporation e from soil t is directly connected with the productivity of vegetation wang et al 2021 theoretically if all water loss occurred through transpiration et c act t a strong correlation between gpp and et c act would be expected as water supply increased the proportion of t to et c act would be decreased liu et al 2022 tian et al 2013 and accordingly the sensitivity of gpp to et c act would be weakened for the three different cropland transformation types the impact of cropland change on wue a e was the result of gpp and et c act i e it was essentially determined by the different relationships between gpp and et c act under different water supplies therefore the impacts of cropland change on wue a e in the three river basins were slightly different due to the location of areas of change in cropland as well as different irrigation and field management practices resulting in different relationships between gpp and et c act fig 10 generally for the hexi corridor an increase in water supply caused the correlation between gpp and et c act to weaken the negative impact of et c act on wue a e to strengthen and the positive impact of gpp on wue a e to weaken 4 2 contribution of e t c a c t and gpp to variation in w u e a e although there were different sensitivities of wue a e to gpp and et c act under different cropland transformation types the contribution of gpp and et c act to wue a e was the synthetical result of their sensitivity to wue a e as well as their magnitudes of variation wang et al 2020 the contribution of gpp to the variation in wue a e for the three cropland transformation types in the three river basins fig 10 varied from 56 90 while the contribution of et c act to wue a e variation varied from 47 42 the absolute contributions of gpp were larger than that of etc ac t indicating that the gpp dominated the variation of wue a e in the hexi corridor s croplands the positive contribution of gpp to wue a e variation in areas within the heihe river basin s cl areas was attributable to a positive correlation between gpp and wue a e under a decreasing gpp variation in contrast the positive contribution of et c act to wue a e variation in cl 0 areas of the shiyang river basin and in cl areas of the heihe river basin was the result of decreasing et c act combined with a negative correlation between et c act and wue a e fig 9 yang et al 2022a analyzed the contribution of gpp and et c act to variations in wue a e in croplands in northwest china by using an attribution method and confirmed the dominant role of gpp in terms of its impact on the variation of cropland wue a e 4 3 applications to agricultural water and land management farmers or local agricultural managers tend to irrigate more during the growing season in order to improve both the wue a e and crop yield however there exists a tradeoff between improvements in wue a e and crop yield with irrigation qiu et al 2008 found that et c act significantly increased when the frequency and depth of irrigation water increased within a growing season such that the wue a e generally decreased and grain yield did not increase therefore deficit irrigation is most appropriate for the areas where precipitation during the growing season is less than 200 mm yu et al 2020 and a suitable irrigation regime is more likely to achieve relatively greater levels of wue a e and crop yield li and wang 2021 for example in order to achieve sustainable regional water resources development irrigation and water conserving cropland management were implemented in the hexi corridor tian et al 2020 according to data from gansu province s report of water resources bulletin hbgp 2020 the irrigation quota presented a decreasing trend over the last 20 years while the cwp crop water productivity defined as the ratio of crop yield to irrigation water increased in all three river basins fig 11 it is consistent in our findings that the wue a e increased in the three cropland transformation types in the three river basins from 2003 to 2020 figs 6 and 9 however the crop yield did not always increase along with the increasing cwp from the correlation between cwp and crop yield in the three river basins of hexi corridor fig 12 we can see that crop yield increased with increasing cwp in the shule and heihe river basins while the crop yield first increased then decreased with increasing cwp in the shiyang river basin this indicated there was a threshold level of water conserving irrigation above which crop yield would be decreased therefore comparison between conventional irrigation a suitable water saving irrigation or deficit irrigation is crucial for maintaining a relatively high cwp without reducing crop yield liu and song 2022 thus we can conclude that the water saving irrigation in the shiyang river basin was excessive and more water should be supplied to maintain a cwp around 0 8 kg m³ whereas in the shule and heihe river basins there remained water saving irrigation potential to improve the cwp future studies should focus on the determination of suitable irrigation levels for different crops under different field management practices 5 conclusions a crucial variable in accounting for biological productivity and water use wue a e is defined as the ratio of gpp to et c act at the agroecosystem scale studying the response of wue a e to agricultural land use change could facilitate the understanding of water carbon interactions and the application of effective cropland management and efficient water use protocols in agricultural areas under current climate change in the present study we investigated different transformations of cropland and evaluated wue a e response to these changes from 2003 2020 by studying gpp and et c act datasets for the three river basins of the hexi corridor the cropland in the hexi corridor increased overall with 2 5 of cropland transferred out and 12 3 of total cropland transferred in between 2003 and 2020 the growing season wue a e showed its highest variation in the areas of cropland transferred in with significant increasing trends of 2 78 10 2 2 48 10 2 and 2 14 10 2 g c kg 1 h2o yr 1 while variation for cl areas was the lowest with values of 0 55 10 2 0 16 10 2 and 1 10 10 2 g c kg 1 h2o yr 1 for the shule heihe and shiyang river basins respectively for all three river basins wue a e showed increasing trends under all three cropland transformation types the absolute contributions of gpp to wue a e were larger than that of et c act indicating the dominance of gpp in controlling the variation of wue a e in the hexi corridor s croplands the impact of cropland change on wue a e was determined by the different correlations between gpp and et c act among the cropland transformation types with an increase in water supply the correlation between gpp and et c act was weakened the negative impact of et c act on wue a e was strengthened and the positive impact of gpp on wue a e was weakened there was a tradeoff between improving wue a e and crop yield with irrigation suitable water saving irrigation is crucial for maintaining a high wue a e without reducing crop yield the water saving irrigation in shiyang river was excessive whereas there was still potential for water saving irrigation in the shule and heihe river basins the results of this study can be potentially applied in agricultural water and land management and efficient water resource utilization for sustainable development in arid regions

9164,the aim of this study was to evaluate the robustness of infra red thermometry to estimate stomatal conductance gs in grapefruit trees for this purpose the ability of several thermal indices to determine gs was tested for different i irrigation strategies full irrigation fi and regulated deficit irrigation rdi ii water sources transfer water tw optimal for agricultural uses and saline reclaimed water rw and iii phenological stages flowering sprouting fs and fruit growth fg during two growing seasons measurements of gs and canopy temperature tc were taken in 14 year old star ruby grapefruit trees citrus paradisi macf air temperature ta was also recorded and then the derived thermal indices tc ta and cwsi crop water stress index were calculated subsequently thermal gs correlations were established at different averaged thermal data intervals and vpd vapour pressure deficit and par photosynthetically active radiation conditions the results indicated that both water quality and deficit irrigation affected negatively gs and tc during fg in addition the highest r2 values in thermal indices gs correlations were found when i the thermal data was averaged 60 min before the gs measurement ii gs was measured over a wide range of vpd between 0 and 3 5 kpa and iii par was 1200 µmol m 2 s 1 the ability of the thermal indices to estimate gs improved under rdi and rw conditions when compared to the control treatment tw fi moreover the thermal indices that more accurately estimated gs were tc ta and cwsi in fs p 0 001 and the absolute values of tc in fg p 0 001 overall thermal indices obtained by infra red sensors could be a useful tool to estimate gs in grapefruit trees however irrigation treatment water quality tree phenological stage and environmental conditions vpd and par must be considered when interpreting thermal indices gs correlations keywords grapefruit leaf temperature thermal indices water status data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction citrus is one of the main fruit tree species cultivated accounting for 16 138 mt of the total fruit production worldwide faostat 2020 spain is the most important mediterranean citrus growing country with a production of 6 0 mt being the main exporter of grapefruit in europe with a 48 of total european exports of this crop fao 2021 citrus production is highly dependent on the availability of water resources which in turn is affected by the ongoing climate change scenario ipcc 2018 water shortages negatively affect citrus yield and fruit quality capra et al 2011 romero trigueros et al 2020 leading to important economic losses to avoid these undesirable effects an optimal use of irrigation water is needed in this sense the use of irrigation strategies such as regulated deficit irrigation rdi contributes to increase water productivity puig sirera et al 2021 with null or low affection of yield and fruit quality coyago cruz et al 2019 similarly irrigation with non conventional water sources such as reclaimed water rw is a good option because it mitigates the problem of water shortage li et al 2021 however both techniques require proper irrigation management because rdi and rw can negatively affect both the soil and the crop romero trigueros et al 2017 irrigation scheduling based on plant water status indicators could also be of interest since they allow to match crop water needs with its supply fernández 2017 previously stem water potential ψstem stomatal conductance gs and trunk diameter variations were used as plant water stress indicators and or for irrigation scheduling purposes hernandez santana et al 2019 intrigliolo et al 2011 mirás avalos et al 2016 however their direct measurements are punctual laborious and time consuming grant et al 2006 and do not allow real time irrigation scheduling unless sensors that measure continuously as dendrometers mirás avalos et al 2016 or leaf turgor pressure sensors are used in this sense canopy temperature tc could be easily remotely and rapidly measured using infra red thermometry sensors irts cifre et al 2005 jones 2004 as opposed to gs and ψstem in addition irts allow to study a large population of leaves bellvert et al 2016 and their measurements can also be extrapolated from the leaf to the field scale gonzález dugo et al 2014 these characteristics make tc and its derived thermal indices the difference between canopy and air temperature tc ta and the crop water stress index cwsi interesting for irrigation scheduling purposes in several studies baluja et al 2012 ben gal et al 2009 pagay and kidman 2019 correlations between thermal indices and traditional indicators of plant water status gs and ψstem were detected in grapefruit trees under saline and water stresses strong correlations were found between several thermal indices tc tc ta and cwsi measured by irts and ψstem romero trigueros et al 2019 however grapefruit has recently been defined as an isohydric species romero trigueros et al 2021 since it shows a rapid stomatal closure in response to water stress conditions thus in this crop gs is a more reliable indicator of plant water status than ψstem however there is a lack of knowledge about the usefulness of the different thermal indices tc tc ta and cwsi for estimating gs in grapefruit trees under saline and water stresses in addition little is known in reference to what time of day corresponding to a given vpd vapour pressure deficit and par photosynthetically active radiation conditions it is best to correlate irt readings and gs measurements therefore the main objective of this study was to estimate gs using irts in grapefruit trees cultivated under different irrigation strategies full irrigation fi and regulated deficit irrigation rdi and combined with two water sources transfer water tw and saline reclaimed water rw the specific objectives were i to assess the seasonal trend of gs and tc ii to evaluate the influence of various irrigation strategies water sources and crop phenological stages in thermal indices vs gs correlations and iii to determine which thermal index correlated best with gs in addition the ability of different thermal indices to determine gs was tested at different averaged thermal data intervals 60 min and timepoint and vpd vpdglobal and vpd 2 and par par1200 equal to saturating irradiance and par 1200 over saturating irradiance conditions in this sense the working hypothesis were that irts can be useful for estimating gs and that correlations between different thermal indices and gs will change depending on treatment crop phenological stage different thermal data intervals and environmental conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 plant material and experimental conditions the experiment was carried out in a 0 5 ha of the commercial orchard lo montero located in molina de segura spain 38 07 18 n 1 13 15 w during two growing seasons 2019 and 2020 the experimental plot was cultivated with adult 14 years old planted in 2005 star ruby grapefruit trees citrus paradisi macf grafted onto citrus macrophylla l rootstocks planted at 6 m x 4 m the irrigation system consisted of a single lateral drip line with four pressure compensated emitters of 4 l h 1 per tree located at 0 8 m from the axis of the trunk irrigation was scheduled based on crop evapotranspiration etc accumulated during the previous week etc was calculated multiplying the reference evapotranspiration et0 allen et al 1998 and specific crop coefficients kc for grapefruit trees pedrero et al 2015 all the trees were fertilised equally 215 110 and 150 kg ha 1 year 1 of n p2o5 and k2o respectively through the drip irrigation system weeds were eradicated by applying pest control methods commonly used by farmers 2 2 water sources and irrigation strategies the experimental plot was irrigated with two water sources transfer water tw and saline reclaimed water rw the tw was pumped from the tajo segura canal and the rw from the tertiary wastewater treatment plant wwtp in molina de segura the tw was considered optimal water for agricultural use due to its low values of electrical conductivity ec close to 1 ds m 1 average value for 2019 and 2020 0 91 0 10 ds m 1 the rw was characterised by having a high salt content and an ec value close to 4 ds m 1 the rw was automatically mixed in the irrigation control head with tw to reduce its ec value 3 5 ds m 1 average value for 2019 and 2020 3 19 0 52 ds m 1 in order to avoid significant yield losses maas 1993 the high level of salinity in rw table 1 was the result of a high concentration of cl na and b which was approximately 7 times higher than in tw moreover the concentration of k and no3 was also high in this saline water source two irrigation strategies were applied for each water source full irrigation fi and regulated deficit irrigation rdi in the fi treatments tw fi and rw fi trees were irrigated at 100 of etc during the experimental period however the trees cultivated under the rdi regime tw rdi and rw rdi were also irrigated at 100 etc except in phase ii of fruit growth from 1st july to 15th september when they were irrigated at 50 of etc these irrigation strategies fi and rdi and water sources tw and rw have been applied since 2007 allowing the assessment of long term effects of these practices on grapefruit tree performance thus the combined treatments evaluated were tw fi rw fi tw rdi and rw rdi tw fi was considered the control treatment in this study the annual amounts of water applied in the fi treatments tw fi and rw fi were 5125 2 and 4978 4 m3 ha 1 in 2019 and 2020 respectively however in the rdi treatments tw rdi and rw rdi they were 3930 1 and 3941 1 m3 ha 1 in 2019 and 2020 respectively the data obtained were separated into two distinct experimental periods referred to p1 and p2 p1 was just before the rdi period and comprised from 1st april to 30th june 2019 and 2020 doy 91 181 and 92 182 respectively this period coincided mainly with the phenological stages of flowering sprouting fs and with low evaporative demand months p2 referred to the rdi period and included the time interval between 1st july and 15th september 2019 and 2020 doy 182 258 and 183 259 respectively in these months the evaporative demand was high and the main phenological stage was fruit growth fg the experiment was laid out in a completely randomised design with four replications per treatment in each replicate the trees were distributed in 3 rows 12 trees in total and measurements were taken on 1 tree of the central row the rest of the trees were considered as border trees 2 3 measurements meteorological variables such as rainfall air temperature ta relative humidity rh et0 and solar radiation rs were recorded in real time in a weather station located at the experimental site the vpd was calculated every hour using the measured ta and rh data the gas exchange parameters gs and net photosynthesis a were measured with a portable photosynthesis system li 6400 licor lincoln ne usa equipped with a broad leaf chamber 6 cm2 inside the measuring chamber the ambient co2 concentration and airflow rate were almost constant being 400 µmol mol 1 and 300 µmol s 1 respectively measurements were taken on mature leaves located on the sunny side of the trees on three leaves per tree and four trees per treatment one per replicate during the experimental period tc was continuously monitored using one infra red sensor per tree apogee instruments utah usa model sif 111 the sensors were mounted on galvanised metal poles and installed approximately 0 5 m above the tree crown the sensors had a field of view fov of 22 and were connected to data loggers model cr1000 campbell scientific ltd shepshed uk which read values every 5 min and recorded average values every 15 min tc was measured on four trees per treatment one per replicate the average values of tc were normalised by calculating the tc ta and cwsi indices as described in romero trigueros et al 2019 2 3 1 study of seasonal trend of gs and tc stomatal conductance measurements were carried out periodically between 08 00 and 10 00 gmt depending on the season of the year and at saturating light intensity 1200 µmol m 2 s 1 and at ambient air temperature and relative humidity canopy temperature was continuously monitored using infra red sensors and data were collected at the time to gs measurement to assess the seasonal trend 2 3 2 study of time interval of thermal data and vpd and par conditions 2 3 2 1 time interval of thermal data the time interval over which the thermal data are averaged could vary the significance of the relationships between the thermal indices tc tc ta and cwsi and gs for this reason two time intervals of thermal data were studied timepoint and preceding 60 min average data 60 min henceforth the timepoint data referred to the tc value at the time of the gs measurement the 60 min included all the values of tc and ta recorded during the hour prior to the time of measurement of gs therefore the derived thermal indices tc ta and cwsi were calculated in two different ways i considering the thermal timepoint data and ii using the preceding 60 min average data of tc and ta in a previous test the preceding 15 and 30 min average thermal data were also evaluated however these data are not included here because of strength of the relationship between thermal indexes tc tc ta and cwsi and punctual stomatal conductance gs was lower at these thermal timeframes preceding 15 and 30 min average thermal data than at timepoint and preceding 60 min average thermal data then the thermal indices tc tc ta and cwsi were correlated with the punctual gs measurements at the two time intervals cited above and taking into account the two experimental periods separately p1 and p2 of both years 2019 and 2020 2 3 2 2 vpd conditions to find out the degree of influence of vpd on gs and tc measurements of our experiment fig 2 vpd and these two physiological parameters tc and gs were measured in control treatment trees tw fi on different days and times during the two growing seasons 2019 and 2020 measurements of gs were carried out at saturating light intensity 1200 µmol m 2 s 1 and at ambient air temperature and relative humidity vpd values were collected at the same time that gs measurements were performed in addition a diurnal course of vpd and gs was carried out in p2 of 2019 in all the treatments studied measurements of gs were carried out hourly at saturating light intensity 1200 µmol m 2 s 1 and at ambient air temperature and relative humidity vpd values were collected at the same time that gs measurements were performed subsequently the hourly values of gs and vpd were correlated see fig 1s supplementary material across treatments then the thermal indices were correlated with gs values at two different vpd levels vpd 2 which comprised gs and thermal data measured at vpd equal or below 2 kpa and vpdglobal which included all gs and thermal data regardless of vpd at the time of measurement in our study vpdglobal ranged from 0 to 3 5 kpa 2 3 2 3 par conditions par could have an effect on the thermal indices gs correlations to test this influence par and the two physiological parameters gs and tc were measured in the control treatment tw fi in different days and hours during two growing seasons 2019 and 2020 fig 3 in addition a par photosynthesis curve was made for each experimental period p1 and p2 in the control treatment tw fi fig 2s supplementary material then the thermal indices were correlated with gs values at two different par levels par1200 equal to saturating irradiance and par 1200 over saturating irradiance par 1200 over saturating irradiance was a non fixed value and ranged between 1300 and 1600 µmol m 2 s 1 depending on the environmental par condition at the time of gs measurement 2 4 statistical analysis analysis of variance anova followed by tukey s multiple test p 0 05 were performed to assess differences between treatments before anova analysis the assumptions of normality and homoscedasticity were checked relationships between tc and vpd gs and par and thermal indices tc tc ta and cwsi and gs were fitted to linear regressions their coefficients of determination r2 are shown in the figs 2b 3 4 and 5 then the coefficients of correlations r were calculated and used to assess the strength of these relationships the relationships between gs and vpd were fitted to quadratic regressions the statistical analysis was performed with ibm spss version 25 spss inc armonk ny usa 2002 3 results 3 1 meteorological conditions and seasonal trend of gs and tc meteorological data for 2019 and 2020 are shown in fig 1a the total annual rainfall and et0 were 508 20 mm and 1413 23 mm respectively in 2019 and 351 01 mm and 1374 47 mm respectively in 2020 the maximum rainfall was recorded in september 2019 accounting for the 49 64 of the annual rainfall in p1 before the rdi period weather conditions were milder than in p2 with an average value of vpd and et0 of around 1 kpa day 1 and 5 mm day 1 in both years studied fig 1a during p1 of 2019 and 2020 gs and tc values were quite similar in tw fi and rw fi trees regardless of water source fig 1b c and d e respectively in p2 coinciding with the rdi period and the summer months the average values of vpd and et0 were around 3 kpa day 1 and 8 mm day 1 respectively in 2019 and 2020 fig 1a in contrast to p1 in this period significant differences in gs fig 1b c and in tc fig 1d e were found among treatments this was especially evident in the case of tc with significant differences between treatments on several days fig 1 d e the highest values of gs and the lowest values of tc were observed in the fi treatments rw fi and tw fi and the opposite behaviour was observed in the rdi treatments rw rdi and tw rdi fig 1b c d and e respectively in september 2019 coinciding with the rainiest month gs and tc values were quite similar in the different irrigation treatments studied fig 1b d the global seasonal average of tc was higher in p2 23 96 c than in p1 19 48 c as expected coinciding with the months of high evaporative demand the same trend was also observed for gs with higher values in p2 96 58 mmol m 2 s 1 than in p1 55 19 mmol m 2 s 1 3 2 relationships between punctual measurements of gs and thermal indices at different time intervals vpd and par conditions the assessment of the relationships between the three thermal indices tc tc ta and cwsi and gs at different thermal data intervals vpd and par conditions are described in the section 3 2 1 3 2 2 and 3 2 3 3 2 1 thermal data time intervals timepoint and preceding 60 min correlations between the different thermal indices and gs considering the two thermal time intervals are shown in table 2 an overall increase in the r2 value and on the significance of the correlations in the 60 min data was observed respect to timepoint data considering the different treatments and only this average data interval 60 min there was no clear trend in p1 with higher r2 values in some cases for the trees irrigated with rw and in other cases for the trees irrigated with tw table 2 however in the second period p2 the rdi trees irrigated with rw showed the highest r2 values except for the tc ta vs gs correlation where the rw fi treatment showed the highest degree of correlation 3 2 2 vpd conditions in our experiment tc and gs were strongly influenced by vpd conditions with r2 value of 0 64 and 0 80 p 0 001 for the correlations between tc and gs with vpd respectively fig 2 thus vpd was a key variable for appropriately estimating gs from thermal indices besides it is important to know the vpd value above which the influence on gs and tc is greatest we observed that gs increased while vpd values ranged from 0 to 1 8 kpa fig 1s see section 2 3 2 however when vpd values were higher than 1 8 kpa a turning point occurred from which gs values began to decrease this behaviour was more accentuated from 2 0 kpa threshold value of vpd that we used to study the influence of vpd on the correlations between gs and thermal indices when thermal indices gs correlations were evaluated at the two different vpd levels vpd 2 and vpdglobal in general higher r2 values were observed for the vpdglobal conditions than for vpd 2 in the three correlations studied tc vs gs tc ta vs gs cwsi vs gs table 3 only in some exceptions the vpd 2 condition had r2 values higher than vpdglobal considering only vpdglobal data all correlations between thermal indices and gs were significant taking into account only vpdglobal data concerning water sources in p2 the highest r2 values were observed for trees irrigated with rw table 3 nevertheless in p1 no clear trend was observed regarding the amount of water applied fi and rdi treatments there was no clear pattern in p2 table 3 for instance in the tc vs gs correlation the rw rdi treatment showed a r2 higher than that obtained for rw fi in other cases the r2 values were similar in the fi and rdi treatments for example in the cwsi vs gs correlation the rw rdi and rw fi treatments showed r2 values of 0 55 and 0 58 respectively overall both rw and rdi treatments increased the magnitude of r2 in the thermal indices vs gs correlations with respect to the control treatment tw fi 3 2 3 par conditions in our study tc and gs of trees were strongly influenced by par levels throughout the vegetative cycles of 2019 and 2020 with r2 value up to 0 5 p 0 001 in both cases fig 3 in such a way that the higher par corresponded with a higher gs fig 3a and tc values fig 3b in the par photosynthesis curves fig 2s supplementary material and see section 2 3 2 when par was higher than 1200 µmol m 2 s 1 a photo inhibition was observed leading to a reduction of gs values for this reason the threshold value of 1200 µmol m 2 s 1 was considered key to study the influence of par in the estimation of gs by thermal data when thermal indices gs correlations were plotted considering the two different par levels par1200 and par 1200 the results pointed to a higher r2 at par1200 than at par 1200 in all correlations studied table 4 in the tc vs gs correlations this was especially evident for rw fi treatment which showed an r2 of 0 52 p 0 01 at par1200 and an r2 of 0 25 no significant at par 1200 in cwsi vs gs correlations all treatments showed a higher r2 for par1200 the same trend was observed in tc ta vs gs correlations with high r2 values in almost all treatments when par1200 was considered as for the periods in p1 and at par1200 there was no definite trend since the highest r2 were shown in some cases by the rw and in other cases by the tw table 4 on the contrary in p2 the use of rw and or rdi generally improved the significance of the correlations respect to the control treatment tw fi thus the highest r2 values of the correlations between thermal indices tc tc ta and cwsi and gs were shown at 60 min averaged thermal data and at vpdglobal and par1200 so that these three conditions were used in the relationships described in the next section 3 3 relationships between gs and thermal indices in different experimental periods and irrigation treatments on the one hand the three correlations tc vs gs tc ta vs gs and cwsi vs gs were first globally adjusted without taking into account treatments and periods the r2 values obtained were significant data not shown however the level of significance of these correlations increased when the different experimental periods were considered fig 4 the r2 values ranged from 0 42 to 0 62 depending on the thermal index and the period fig 4a b and c in general all correlations showed a high significance level p 0 01 and p 0 001 in p1 coinciding with the phenological stage of fs the highest r2 values r2 0 52 p 0 001 were observed for the normalised thermal indices tc ta and cwsi unlike what was observed in p1 in p2 which coincided with the phenological stage of fg the absolute values of tc showed a higher r2 value r2 0 62 p 0 001 than the normalised thermal indices vs gs on the other hand to study the influence of irrigation treatments and water quality in thermal indices vs gs correlations we considered the four treatments of p2 rw fi rw rdi tw fi and tw rdi fig 5 in all the correlations studied rw fi trees showed slightly greater r2 values than tw fi trees and the same trend was observed for the rdi treatments rw rdi and tw rdi fig 5 as an example in the case of tc vs gs correlation the value of r2 for tw fi was 0 52 and for tw rdi rw fi and rw rdi were 0 56 0 70 and 0 64 respectively in addition the absolute value of tc was the best index in p2 fig 4 since the r2 values were higher for the tc vs gs regressions fig 5a than for those considering the two normalised thermal indices fig 5b c 4 discussion 4 1 influence of water source and irrigation strategy on gs and tc dynamics in different crop phenological stages in this work prior to the evaluation of estimation of gs using irt sensors we assessed whether the use of rw or deficit irrigation at different crop phenological stages can influence the dynamics of tc and gs of grapefruit trees the measurements of gs and tc which were carried out in the different treatments during fs p1 and fg p2 phenological stages of 2019 and 2020 suggested that when the weather conditions were mild p1 water quality had no effect in gs and tc seasonal dynamics in agreement with what was observed previously by romero trigueros et al 2014 in the same crop however when the weather conditions were more demanding stomatal aperture was greater in all trees compared to p1 this favouring of stomatal aperture could be aimed at increasing co2 uptake and subsequently photosynthetic capacity and production of photo assimilates which are necessary for fruit development a recent study in lime trees mira garcía et al 2021 also observed an increase in gs coinciding with fruit development stage in addition warming of the canopy was also observed in p2 as a consequence among other factors of an increase in ta during the summer months as tc is mainly driven by environmental factors such as ta or rh pineda et al 2021 in contrast both rw and rdi influenced stomatal regulation of grapefruit trees in p2 and therefore they affected canopy warming dynamics as for water quality tw fi trees showed a higher stomatal conductance than rw fi trees due to the high leaf concentration of salts cl and or na and b in trees irrigated with rw romero trigueros et al 2017 which reduce leaf gas exchange pedrero et al 2015 the amount of water applied fi or rdi also interfered in the behaviour of both parameters rdi trees showed a decrease in stomatal aperture in agreement with what has been observed by other authors anjum 2008 gonzález dugo et al 2019 melgar et al 2008 in citrus regardless of treatment tc showed the opposite response to gs as expected in such a way that a high stomatal aperture induced a reduction in canopy temperature and vice versa costa et al 2012 4 2 relationship between thermal indices and gs at different time intervals vpd and par conditions in this study one of the main objectives was to estimate gs by different thermal indices tc tc ta and cwsi however the relationship between gs and thermal indices could be influenced by the time interval in which temperature data are averaged and the vpd and par conditions when gs was measured therefore as a novelty of this work correlations of tc tc ta and cwsi vs gs were tested under several thermal data average intervals 60 min and timepoint vpd vpd 2 and vpdglobal and par par1200 and par 1200 conditions the results suggested that gs values were more closely related to the preceding 60 min averaged tc values than with timepoint tc data suggesting that gs integrated previous values of canopy temperature which in turn depends on meteorological grant et al 2016 and plant hydric conditions romero trigueros et al 2019 in a previous unpublished study the authors also evaluated other thermal data average intervals 15 and 30 min but their results are not shown here since the r2 values obtained with these intervals were lower than those obtained at 60 min moreover meteorological conditions such as vpd also influence the values of gs diaz espejo et al 2007 and tc mahan et al 2016 here vpd was correlated with tc so that an increase in vpd promoted a linear increase in canopy heating nevertheless unlike tc the influence of vpd on gs changed depending on vpd conditions at low vpd conditions vpd 2 stomatal conductance was less sensitive to changes of vpd as also pointed out by yáñez et al 2021 than tc this is as vpd increase within a range between 0 and 2 kpa tc increased simultaneously with vpd while gs remained stable leading to a decrease in the strength of thermal indices gs correlations an additional meteorological condition which influenced the dynamic of the stomata was par as observed in our results and in a recent study also performed on grapefruit trees romero trigueros et al 2019 another recent study performed on lime trees reported that a 53 increase in par led to a 46 reduction in the accumulated daily gs value mira garcía et al 2020 in our work both physiological parameters gs and tc were influenced by par with high r2 values between them in the case of tc an increase in par caused a direct canopy warming however in the case of gs the clear reduction in gs values when par exceeded 1200 µmol m 2 s 1 indicated that this value is the saturating par in grapefruit trees this justified why when thermal indices gs correlations were assessed at two par levels par1200 and par 1200 a more direct relationship between tc and gs was found at par equal to 1200 µmol m 2 s 1 4 3 the best thermal index for estimating gs a significant r2 value between thermal indices gs was found in several species such as almond trees gonzález dugo et al 2012 vineyards baluja et al 2012 and spinach masseroni et al 2017 here in cwsi vs gs correlation r2 values were slightly lower than those observed in other studies performed on firmiana platanifolia yu et al 2015 sunflowers planted in pots nielsen and anderson 1989 and vines cultivated in soil belfiore et al 2019 the same was observed for the tc ta vs gs correlation where the r2 value was slightly lower here than for a clementina de nules commercial orchard ballester et al 2013 this could be because in those studies tc ta and cwsi were calculated from thermal image data and not from irt sensors data like in our study and normally the thermal images are taken on the same part of the tree where gs is measured leinonen et al 2006 here the measurements of gs were performed in the lower part of the canopy while our irt sensors took measurements in the upper part of the canopy this fact indicates that the accuracy of our model could be improved by carrying out future trials where both physiological variables tc and gs are measured in the same area of the tree moreover the correlations of our work were assessed at two different phenological stages p1 and p2 coinciding with the phenological stages of flowering sprouting and fruit growth respectively the fact that most suitable indicators in p1 were the normalised thermal indices tc ta and cwsi and in p2 the absolute values of tc indicated that tc was less sensitive to changes in gs values when climatic conditions were less demanding in p1 the crop temperature depended mainly on external climatic conditions rather than plant water status on the contrary in p2 the increase in the atmospheric demand gave rise to the canopy temperature was more influenced by plant intrinsic factors greater or lesser stomatal opening than air temperature according to shoa et al 2021 thus thermal measurements needed less normalisation in p2 in line with another study meron et al 2013 in which climatic conditions were evaluated besides we also evaluated the influence of treatments on the thermal indices vs gs correlations for all treatments studied rw fi rw rdi tw fi and tw rdi tc was the best thermal indicator for more accurately estimating gs in p2 stomatal conductance has already used for irrigation scheduling in other crops hernandez santana et al 2019 and is the plant water status indicator more reliable for grapefruit romero trigueros et al 2021 for this in future trials after improving the accuracy of the correlations it would be advisable to validate the use of gs estimated by thermoradiometers to schedule irrigation in grapefruit trees that is to define the optimal gs values in the different phenological stages and irrigation strategies and then to translate these gs values into threshold values of thermal indices for an efficient irrigation management in summary the ability of thermal indices obtained by thermometry to estimate gs in grapefruit trees under rw and rdi was evaluated here the results can be summarised in the following statements i the value of gs at a given moment integrated the tc of the previous 60 min ii the estimation of stomatal conductance by irt improved when gs and tc values were collected during a wide range of vpd should not be limited to vpd 2 kpa and when par did not exceed 1200 µmol m 2 s 1 iii the absolute value of tc was the most suitable thermal indicator in all treatments during fruit growth stage and iv the ability of tc to estimate gs improved when rw and rdi strategies were used compared with tw fi 5 conclusion the robustness of the different thermal indices tc tc ta and cwsi for estimating stomatal conductance of grapefruit trees was tested for the first time on several thermal data intervals and environmental conditions the results suggested that thermal indices gs correlations had the highest degree of correlation when preceding 60 min thermal average data vpdglobal and par1200 were considered in these time intervals and environmental conditions trees under deficit irrigation and those irrigated with reclaimed water showed an increase in the thermal indices gs r2 values we also found the most suitable thermal indicator in each of the different phenological stages and irrigation treatments studied normalised thermal indices were the most robust during flowering sprouting p1 and the absolute values of tc during fruit growth phenological stage p2 independently of quality of the irrigation source and the amount of water applied nevertheless the maximum variance explanation achieved was around 70 due to among other factors the gs measurements were performed in the middle part of the tree canopy while irt sensors were placed above the canopy thus in future research the precision of these relationships should be improved by determining the proper part of the tree where gs and tc should be measured then it would be interesting to test the capacity of the model for scheduling irrigation and or estimation of the threshold of gs or tc at which irrigation should be

9164,the aim of this study was to evaluate the robustness of infra red thermometry to estimate stomatal conductance gs in grapefruit trees for this purpose the ability of several thermal indices to determine gs was tested for different i irrigation strategies full irrigation fi and regulated deficit irrigation rdi ii water sources transfer water tw optimal for agricultural uses and saline reclaimed water rw and iii phenological stages flowering sprouting fs and fruit growth fg during two growing seasons measurements of gs and canopy temperature tc were taken in 14 year old star ruby grapefruit trees citrus paradisi macf air temperature ta was also recorded and then the derived thermal indices tc ta and cwsi crop water stress index were calculated subsequently thermal gs correlations were established at different averaged thermal data intervals and vpd vapour pressure deficit and par photosynthetically active radiation conditions the results indicated that both water quality and deficit irrigation affected negatively gs and tc during fg in addition the highest r2 values in thermal indices gs correlations were found when i the thermal data was averaged 60 min before the gs measurement ii gs was measured over a wide range of vpd between 0 and 3 5 kpa and iii par was 1200 µmol m 2 s 1 the ability of the thermal indices to estimate gs improved under rdi and rw conditions when compared to the control treatment tw fi moreover the thermal indices that more accurately estimated gs were tc ta and cwsi in fs p 0 001 and the absolute values of tc in fg p 0 001 overall thermal indices obtained by infra red sensors could be a useful tool to estimate gs in grapefruit trees however irrigation treatment water quality tree phenological stage and environmental conditions vpd and par must be considered when interpreting thermal indices gs correlations keywords grapefruit leaf temperature thermal indices water status data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction citrus is one of the main fruit tree species cultivated accounting for 16 138 mt of the total fruit production worldwide faostat 2020 spain is the most important mediterranean citrus growing country with a production of 6 0 mt being the main exporter of grapefruit in europe with a 48 of total european exports of this crop fao 2021 citrus production is highly dependent on the availability of water resources which in turn is affected by the ongoing climate change scenario ipcc 2018 water shortages negatively affect citrus yield and fruit quality capra et al 2011 romero trigueros et al 2020 leading to important economic losses to avoid these undesirable effects an optimal use of irrigation water is needed in this sense the use of irrigation strategies such as regulated deficit irrigation rdi contributes to increase water productivity puig sirera et al 2021 with null or low affection of yield and fruit quality coyago cruz et al 2019 similarly irrigation with non conventional water sources such as reclaimed water rw is a good option because it mitigates the problem of water shortage li et al 2021 however both techniques require proper irrigation management because rdi and rw can negatively affect both the soil and the crop romero trigueros et al 2017 irrigation scheduling based on plant water status indicators could also be of interest since they allow to match crop water needs with its supply fernández 2017 previously stem water potential ψstem stomatal conductance gs and trunk diameter variations were used as plant water stress indicators and or for irrigation scheduling purposes hernandez santana et al 2019 intrigliolo et al 2011 mirás avalos et al 2016 however their direct measurements are punctual laborious and time consuming grant et al 2006 and do not allow real time irrigation scheduling unless sensors that measure continuously as dendrometers mirás avalos et al 2016 or leaf turgor pressure sensors are used in this sense canopy temperature tc could be easily remotely and rapidly measured using infra red thermometry sensors irts cifre et al 2005 jones 2004 as opposed to gs and ψstem in addition irts allow to study a large population of leaves bellvert et al 2016 and their measurements can also be extrapolated from the leaf to the field scale gonzález dugo et al 2014 these characteristics make tc and its derived thermal indices the difference between canopy and air temperature tc ta and the crop water stress index cwsi interesting for irrigation scheduling purposes in several studies baluja et al 2012 ben gal et al 2009 pagay and kidman 2019 correlations between thermal indices and traditional indicators of plant water status gs and ψstem were detected in grapefruit trees under saline and water stresses strong correlations were found between several thermal indices tc tc ta and cwsi measured by irts and ψstem romero trigueros et al 2019 however grapefruit has recently been defined as an isohydric species romero trigueros et al 2021 since it shows a rapid stomatal closure in response to water stress conditions thus in this crop gs is a more reliable indicator of plant water status than ψstem however there is a lack of knowledge about the usefulness of the different thermal indices tc tc ta and cwsi for estimating gs in grapefruit trees under saline and water stresses in addition little is known in reference to what time of day corresponding to a given vpd vapour pressure deficit and par photosynthetically active radiation conditions it is best to correlate irt readings and gs measurements therefore the main objective of this study was to estimate gs using irts in grapefruit trees cultivated under different irrigation strategies full irrigation fi and regulated deficit irrigation rdi and combined with two water sources transfer water tw and saline reclaimed water rw the specific objectives were i to assess the seasonal trend of gs and tc ii to evaluate the influence of various irrigation strategies water sources and crop phenological stages in thermal indices vs gs correlations and iii to determine which thermal index correlated best with gs in addition the ability of different thermal indices to determine gs was tested at different averaged thermal data intervals 60 min and timepoint and vpd vpdglobal and vpd 2 and par par1200 equal to saturating irradiance and par 1200 over saturating irradiance conditions in this sense the working hypothesis were that irts can be useful for estimating gs and that correlations between different thermal indices and gs will change depending on treatment crop phenological stage different thermal data intervals and environmental conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 plant material and experimental conditions the experiment was carried out in a 0 5 ha of the commercial orchard lo montero located in molina de segura spain 38 07 18 n 1 13 15 w during two growing seasons 2019 and 2020 the experimental plot was cultivated with adult 14 years old planted in 2005 star ruby grapefruit trees citrus paradisi macf grafted onto citrus macrophylla l rootstocks planted at 6 m x 4 m the irrigation system consisted of a single lateral drip line with four pressure compensated emitters of 4 l h 1 per tree located at 0 8 m from the axis of the trunk irrigation was scheduled based on crop evapotranspiration etc accumulated during the previous week etc was calculated multiplying the reference evapotranspiration et0 allen et al 1998 and specific crop coefficients kc for grapefruit trees pedrero et al 2015 all the trees were fertilised equally 215 110 and 150 kg ha 1 year 1 of n p2o5 and k2o respectively through the drip irrigation system weeds were eradicated by applying pest control methods commonly used by farmers 2 2 water sources and irrigation strategies the experimental plot was irrigated with two water sources transfer water tw and saline reclaimed water rw the tw was pumped from the tajo segura canal and the rw from the tertiary wastewater treatment plant wwtp in molina de segura the tw was considered optimal water for agricultural use due to its low values of electrical conductivity ec close to 1 ds m 1 average value for 2019 and 2020 0 91 0 10 ds m 1 the rw was characterised by having a high salt content and an ec value close to 4 ds m 1 the rw was automatically mixed in the irrigation control head with tw to reduce its ec value 3 5 ds m 1 average value for 2019 and 2020 3 19 0 52 ds m 1 in order to avoid significant yield losses maas 1993 the high level of salinity in rw table 1 was the result of a high concentration of cl na and b which was approximately 7 times higher than in tw moreover the concentration of k and no3 was also high in this saline water source two irrigation strategies were applied for each water source full irrigation fi and regulated deficit irrigation rdi in the fi treatments tw fi and rw fi trees were irrigated at 100 of etc during the experimental period however the trees cultivated under the rdi regime tw rdi and rw rdi were also irrigated at 100 etc except in phase ii of fruit growth from 1st july to 15th september when they were irrigated at 50 of etc these irrigation strategies fi and rdi and water sources tw and rw have been applied since 2007 allowing the assessment of long term effects of these practices on grapefruit tree performance thus the combined treatments evaluated were tw fi rw fi tw rdi and rw rdi tw fi was considered the control treatment in this study the annual amounts of water applied in the fi treatments tw fi and rw fi were 5125 2 and 4978 4 m3 ha 1 in 2019 and 2020 respectively however in the rdi treatments tw rdi and rw rdi they were 3930 1 and 3941 1 m3 ha 1 in 2019 and 2020 respectively the data obtained were separated into two distinct experimental periods referred to p1 and p2 p1 was just before the rdi period and comprised from 1st april to 30th june 2019 and 2020 doy 91 181 and 92 182 respectively this period coincided mainly with the phenological stages of flowering sprouting fs and with low evaporative demand months p2 referred to the rdi period and included the time interval between 1st july and 15th september 2019 and 2020 doy 182 258 and 183 259 respectively in these months the evaporative demand was high and the main phenological stage was fruit growth fg the experiment was laid out in a completely randomised design with four replications per treatment in each replicate the trees were distributed in 3 rows 12 trees in total and measurements were taken on 1 tree of the central row the rest of the trees were considered as border trees 2 3 measurements meteorological variables such as rainfall air temperature ta relative humidity rh et0 and solar radiation rs were recorded in real time in a weather station located at the experimental site the vpd was calculated every hour using the measured ta and rh data the gas exchange parameters gs and net photosynthesis a were measured with a portable photosynthesis system li 6400 licor lincoln ne usa equipped with a broad leaf chamber 6 cm2 inside the measuring chamber the ambient co2 concentration and airflow rate were almost constant being 400 µmol mol 1 and 300 µmol s 1 respectively measurements were taken on mature leaves located on the sunny side of the trees on three leaves per tree and four trees per treatment one per replicate during the experimental period tc was continuously monitored using one infra red sensor per tree apogee instruments utah usa model sif 111 the sensors were mounted on galvanised metal poles and installed approximately 0 5 m above the tree crown the sensors had a field of view fov of 22 and were connected to data loggers model cr1000 campbell scientific ltd shepshed uk which read values every 5 min and recorded average values every 15 min tc was measured on four trees per treatment one per replicate the average values of tc were normalised by calculating the tc ta and cwsi indices as described in romero trigueros et al 2019 2 3 1 study of seasonal trend of gs and tc stomatal conductance measurements were carried out periodically between 08 00 and 10 00 gmt depending on the season of the year and at saturating light intensity 1200 µmol m 2 s 1 and at ambient air temperature and relative humidity canopy temperature was continuously monitored using infra red sensors and data were collected at the time to gs measurement to assess the seasonal trend 2 3 2 study of time interval of thermal data and vpd and par conditions 2 3 2 1 time interval of thermal data the time interval over which the thermal data are averaged could vary the significance of the relationships between the thermal indices tc tc ta and cwsi and gs for this reason two time intervals of thermal data were studied timepoint and preceding 60 min average data 60 min henceforth the timepoint data referred to the tc value at the time of the gs measurement the 60 min included all the values of tc and ta recorded during the hour prior to the time of measurement of gs therefore the derived thermal indices tc ta and cwsi were calculated in two different ways i considering the thermal timepoint data and ii using the preceding 60 min average data of tc and ta in a previous test the preceding 15 and 30 min average thermal data were also evaluated however these data are not included here because of strength of the relationship between thermal indexes tc tc ta and cwsi and punctual stomatal conductance gs was lower at these thermal timeframes preceding 15 and 30 min average thermal data than at timepoint and preceding 60 min average thermal data then the thermal indices tc tc ta and cwsi were correlated with the punctual gs measurements at the two time intervals cited above and taking into account the two experimental periods separately p1 and p2 of both years 2019 and 2020 2 3 2 2 vpd conditions to find out the degree of influence of vpd on gs and tc measurements of our experiment fig 2 vpd and these two physiological parameters tc and gs were measured in control treatment trees tw fi on different days and times during the two growing seasons 2019 and 2020 measurements of gs were carried out at saturating light intensity 1200 µmol m 2 s 1 and at ambient air temperature and relative humidity vpd values were collected at the same time that gs measurements were performed in addition a diurnal course of vpd and gs was carried out in p2 of 2019 in all the treatments studied measurements of gs were carried out hourly at saturating light intensity 1200 µmol m 2 s 1 and at ambient air temperature and relative humidity vpd values were collected at the same time that gs measurements were performed subsequently the hourly values of gs and vpd were correlated see fig 1s supplementary material across treatments then the thermal indices were correlated with gs values at two different vpd levels vpd 2 which comprised gs and thermal data measured at vpd equal or below 2 kpa and vpdglobal which included all gs and thermal data regardless of vpd at the time of measurement in our study vpdglobal ranged from 0 to 3 5 kpa 2 3 2 3 par conditions par could have an effect on the thermal indices gs correlations to test this influence par and the two physiological parameters gs and tc were measured in the control treatment tw fi in different days and hours during two growing seasons 2019 and 2020 fig 3 in addition a par photosynthesis curve was made for each experimental period p1 and p2 in the control treatment tw fi fig 2s supplementary material then the thermal indices were correlated with gs values at two different par levels par1200 equal to saturating irradiance and par 1200 over saturating irradiance par 1200 over saturating irradiance was a non fixed value and ranged between 1300 and 1600 µmol m 2 s 1 depending on the environmental par condition at the time of gs measurement 2 4 statistical analysis analysis of variance anova followed by tukey s multiple test p 0 05 were performed to assess differences between treatments before anova analysis the assumptions of normality and homoscedasticity were checked relationships between tc and vpd gs and par and thermal indices tc tc ta and cwsi and gs were fitted to linear regressions their coefficients of determination r2 are shown in the figs 2b 3 4 and 5 then the coefficients of correlations r were calculated and used to assess the strength of these relationships the relationships between gs and vpd were fitted to quadratic regressions the statistical analysis was performed with ibm spss version 25 spss inc armonk ny usa 2002 3 results 3 1 meteorological conditions and seasonal trend of gs and tc meteorological data for 2019 and 2020 are shown in fig 1a the total annual rainfall and et0 were 508 20 mm and 1413 23 mm respectively in 2019 and 351 01 mm and 1374 47 mm respectively in 2020 the maximum rainfall was recorded in september 2019 accounting for the 49 64 of the annual rainfall in p1 before the rdi period weather conditions were milder than in p2 with an average value of vpd and et0 of around 1 kpa day 1 and 5 mm day 1 in both years studied fig 1a during p1 of 2019 and 2020 gs and tc values were quite similar in tw fi and rw fi trees regardless of water source fig 1b c and d e respectively in p2 coinciding with the rdi period and the summer months the average values of vpd and et0 were around 3 kpa day 1 and 8 mm day 1 respectively in 2019 and 2020 fig 1a in contrast to p1 in this period significant differences in gs fig 1b c and in tc fig 1d e were found among treatments this was especially evident in the case of tc with significant differences between treatments on several days fig 1 d e the highest values of gs and the lowest values of tc were observed in the fi treatments rw fi and tw fi and the opposite behaviour was observed in the rdi treatments rw rdi and tw rdi fig 1b c d and e respectively in september 2019 coinciding with the rainiest month gs and tc values were quite similar in the different irrigation treatments studied fig 1b d the global seasonal average of tc was higher in p2 23 96 c than in p1 19 48 c as expected coinciding with the months of high evaporative demand the same trend was also observed for gs with higher values in p2 96 58 mmol m 2 s 1 than in p1 55 19 mmol m 2 s 1 3 2 relationships between punctual measurements of gs and thermal indices at different time intervals vpd and par conditions the assessment of the relationships between the three thermal indices tc tc ta and cwsi and gs at different thermal data intervals vpd and par conditions are described in the section 3 2 1 3 2 2 and 3 2 3 3 2 1 thermal data time intervals timepoint and preceding 60 min correlations between the different thermal indices and gs considering the two thermal time intervals are shown in table 2 an overall increase in the r2 value and on the significance of the correlations in the 60 min data was observed respect to timepoint data considering the different treatments and only this average data interval 60 min there was no clear trend in p1 with higher r2 values in some cases for the trees irrigated with rw and in other cases for the trees irrigated with tw table 2 however in the second period p2 the rdi trees irrigated with rw showed the highest r2 values except for the tc ta vs gs correlation where the rw fi treatment showed the highest degree of correlation 3 2 2 vpd conditions in our experiment tc and gs were strongly influenced by vpd conditions with r2 value of 0 64 and 0 80 p 0 001 for the correlations between tc and gs with vpd respectively fig 2 thus vpd was a key variable for appropriately estimating gs from thermal indices besides it is important to know the vpd value above which the influence on gs and tc is greatest we observed that gs increased while vpd values ranged from 0 to 1 8 kpa fig 1s see section 2 3 2 however when vpd values were higher than 1 8 kpa a turning point occurred from which gs values began to decrease this behaviour was more accentuated from 2 0 kpa threshold value of vpd that we used to study the influence of vpd on the correlations between gs and thermal indices when thermal indices gs correlations were evaluated at the two different vpd levels vpd 2 and vpdglobal in general higher r2 values were observed for the vpdglobal conditions than for vpd 2 in the three correlations studied tc vs gs tc ta vs gs cwsi vs gs table 3 only in some exceptions the vpd 2 condition had r2 values higher than vpdglobal considering only vpdglobal data all correlations between thermal indices and gs were significant taking into account only vpdglobal data concerning water sources in p2 the highest r2 values were observed for trees irrigated with rw table 3 nevertheless in p1 no clear trend was observed regarding the amount of water applied fi and rdi treatments there was no clear pattern in p2 table 3 for instance in the tc vs gs correlation the rw rdi treatment showed a r2 higher than that obtained for rw fi in other cases the r2 values were similar in the fi and rdi treatments for example in the cwsi vs gs correlation the rw rdi and rw fi treatments showed r2 values of 0 55 and 0 58 respectively overall both rw and rdi treatments increased the magnitude of r2 in the thermal indices vs gs correlations with respect to the control treatment tw fi 3 2 3 par conditions in our study tc and gs of trees were strongly influenced by par levels throughout the vegetative cycles of 2019 and 2020 with r2 value up to 0 5 p 0 001 in both cases fig 3 in such a way that the higher par corresponded with a higher gs fig 3a and tc values fig 3b in the par photosynthesis curves fig 2s supplementary material and see section 2 3 2 when par was higher than 1200 µmol m 2 s 1 a photo inhibition was observed leading to a reduction of gs values for this reason the threshold value of 1200 µmol m 2 s 1 was considered key to study the influence of par in the estimation of gs by thermal data when thermal indices gs correlations were plotted considering the two different par levels par1200 and par 1200 the results pointed to a higher r2 at par1200 than at par 1200 in all correlations studied table 4 in the tc vs gs correlations this was especially evident for rw fi treatment which showed an r2 of 0 52 p 0 01 at par1200 and an r2 of 0 25 no significant at par 1200 in cwsi vs gs correlations all treatments showed a higher r2 for par1200 the same trend was observed in tc ta vs gs correlations with high r2 values in almost all treatments when par1200 was considered as for the periods in p1 and at par1200 there was no definite trend since the highest r2 were shown in some cases by the rw and in other cases by the tw table 4 on the contrary in p2 the use of rw and or rdi generally improved the significance of the correlations respect to the control treatment tw fi thus the highest r2 values of the correlations between thermal indices tc tc ta and cwsi and gs were shown at 60 min averaged thermal data and at vpdglobal and par1200 so that these three conditions were used in the relationships described in the next section 3 3 relationships between gs and thermal indices in different experimental periods and irrigation treatments on the one hand the three correlations tc vs gs tc ta vs gs and cwsi vs gs were first globally adjusted without taking into account treatments and periods the r2 values obtained were significant data not shown however the level of significance of these correlations increased when the different experimental periods were considered fig 4 the r2 values ranged from 0 42 to 0 62 depending on the thermal index and the period fig 4a b and c in general all correlations showed a high significance level p 0 01 and p 0 001 in p1 coinciding with the phenological stage of fs the highest r2 values r2 0 52 p 0 001 were observed for the normalised thermal indices tc ta and cwsi unlike what was observed in p1 in p2 which coincided with the phenological stage of fg the absolute values of tc showed a higher r2 value r2 0 62 p 0 001 than the normalised thermal indices vs gs on the other hand to study the influence of irrigation treatments and water quality in thermal indices vs gs correlations we considered the four treatments of p2 rw fi rw rdi tw fi and tw rdi fig 5 in all the correlations studied rw fi trees showed slightly greater r2 values than tw fi trees and the same trend was observed for the rdi treatments rw rdi and tw rdi fig 5 as an example in the case of tc vs gs correlation the value of r2 for tw fi was 0 52 and for tw rdi rw fi and rw rdi were 0 56 0 70 and 0 64 respectively in addition the absolute value of tc was the best index in p2 fig 4 since the r2 values were higher for the tc vs gs regressions fig 5a than for those considering the two normalised thermal indices fig 5b c 4 discussion 4 1 influence of water source and irrigation strategy on gs and tc dynamics in different crop phenological stages in this work prior to the evaluation of estimation of gs using irt sensors we assessed whether the use of rw or deficit irrigation at different crop phenological stages can influence the dynamics of tc and gs of grapefruit trees the measurements of gs and tc which were carried out in the different treatments during fs p1 and fg p2 phenological stages of 2019 and 2020 suggested that when the weather conditions were mild p1 water quality had no effect in gs and tc seasonal dynamics in agreement with what was observed previously by romero trigueros et al 2014 in the same crop however when the weather conditions were more demanding stomatal aperture was greater in all trees compared to p1 this favouring of stomatal aperture could be aimed at increasing co2 uptake and subsequently photosynthetic capacity and production of photo assimilates which are necessary for fruit development a recent study in lime trees mira garcía et al 2021 also observed an increase in gs coinciding with fruit development stage in addition warming of the canopy was also observed in p2 as a consequence among other factors of an increase in ta during the summer months as tc is mainly driven by environmental factors such as ta or rh pineda et al 2021 in contrast both rw and rdi influenced stomatal regulation of grapefruit trees in p2 and therefore they affected canopy warming dynamics as for water quality tw fi trees showed a higher stomatal conductance than rw fi trees due to the high leaf concentration of salts cl and or na and b in trees irrigated with rw romero trigueros et al 2017 which reduce leaf gas exchange pedrero et al 2015 the amount of water applied fi or rdi also interfered in the behaviour of both parameters rdi trees showed a decrease in stomatal aperture in agreement with what has been observed by other authors anjum 2008 gonzález dugo et al 2019 melgar et al 2008 in citrus regardless of treatment tc showed the opposite response to gs as expected in such a way that a high stomatal aperture induced a reduction in canopy temperature and vice versa costa et al 2012 4 2 relationship between thermal indices and gs at different time intervals vpd and par conditions in this study one of the main objectives was to estimate gs by different thermal indices tc tc ta and cwsi however the relationship between gs and thermal indices could be influenced by the time interval in which temperature data are averaged and the vpd and par conditions when gs was measured therefore as a novelty of this work correlations of tc tc ta and cwsi vs gs were tested under several thermal data average intervals 60 min and timepoint vpd vpd 2 and vpdglobal and par par1200 and par 1200 conditions the results suggested that gs values were more closely related to the preceding 60 min averaged tc values than with timepoint tc data suggesting that gs integrated previous values of canopy temperature which in turn depends on meteorological grant et al 2016 and plant hydric conditions romero trigueros et al 2019 in a previous unpublished study the authors also evaluated other thermal data average intervals 15 and 30 min but their results are not shown here since the r2 values obtained with these intervals were lower than those obtained at 60 min moreover meteorological conditions such as vpd also influence the values of gs diaz espejo et al 2007 and tc mahan et al 2016 here vpd was correlated with tc so that an increase in vpd promoted a linear increase in canopy heating nevertheless unlike tc the influence of vpd on gs changed depending on vpd conditions at low vpd conditions vpd 2 stomatal conductance was less sensitive to changes of vpd as also pointed out by yáñez et al 2021 than tc this is as vpd increase within a range between 0 and 2 kpa tc increased simultaneously with vpd while gs remained stable leading to a decrease in the strength of thermal indices gs correlations an additional meteorological condition which influenced the dynamic of the stomata was par as observed in our results and in a recent study also performed on grapefruit trees romero trigueros et al 2019 another recent study performed on lime trees reported that a 53 increase in par led to a 46 reduction in the accumulated daily gs value mira garcía et al 2020 in our work both physiological parameters gs and tc were influenced by par with high r2 values between them in the case of tc an increase in par caused a direct canopy warming however in the case of gs the clear reduction in gs values when par exceeded 1200 µmol m 2 s 1 indicated that this value is the saturating par in grapefruit trees this justified why when thermal indices gs correlations were assessed at two par levels par1200 and par 1200 a more direct relationship between tc and gs was found at par equal to 1200 µmol m 2 s 1 4 3 the best thermal index for estimating gs a significant r2 value between thermal indices gs was found in several species such as almond trees gonzález dugo et al 2012 vineyards baluja et al 2012 and spinach masseroni et al 2017 here in cwsi vs gs correlation r2 values were slightly lower than those observed in other studies performed on firmiana platanifolia yu et al 2015 sunflowers planted in pots nielsen and anderson 1989 and vines cultivated in soil belfiore et al 2019 the same was observed for the tc ta vs gs correlation where the r2 value was slightly lower here than for a clementina de nules commercial orchard ballester et al 2013 this could be because in those studies tc ta and cwsi were calculated from thermal image data and not from irt sensors data like in our study and normally the thermal images are taken on the same part of the tree where gs is measured leinonen et al 2006 here the measurements of gs were performed in the lower part of the canopy while our irt sensors took measurements in the upper part of the canopy this fact indicates that the accuracy of our model could be improved by carrying out future trials where both physiological variables tc and gs are measured in the same area of the tree moreover the correlations of our work were assessed at two different phenological stages p1 and p2 coinciding with the phenological stages of flowering sprouting and fruit growth respectively the fact that most suitable indicators in p1 were the normalised thermal indices tc ta and cwsi and in p2 the absolute values of tc indicated that tc was less sensitive to changes in gs values when climatic conditions were less demanding in p1 the crop temperature depended mainly on external climatic conditions rather than plant water status on the contrary in p2 the increase in the atmospheric demand gave rise to the canopy temperature was more influenced by plant intrinsic factors greater or lesser stomatal opening than air temperature according to shoa et al 2021 thus thermal measurements needed less normalisation in p2 in line with another study meron et al 2013 in which climatic conditions were evaluated besides we also evaluated the influence of treatments on the thermal indices vs gs correlations for all treatments studied rw fi rw rdi tw fi and tw rdi tc was the best thermal indicator for more accurately estimating gs in p2 stomatal conductance has already used for irrigation scheduling in other crops hernandez santana et al 2019 and is the plant water status indicator more reliable for grapefruit romero trigueros et al 2021 for this in future trials after improving the accuracy of the correlations it would be advisable to validate the use of gs estimated by thermoradiometers to schedule irrigation in grapefruit trees that is to define the optimal gs values in the different phenological stages and irrigation strategies and then to translate these gs values into threshold values of thermal indices for an efficient irrigation management in summary the ability of thermal indices obtained by thermometry to estimate gs in grapefruit trees under rw and rdi was evaluated here the results can be summarised in the following statements i the value of gs at a given moment integrated the tc of the previous 60 min ii the estimation of stomatal conductance by irt improved when gs and tc values were collected during a wide range of vpd should not be limited to vpd 2 kpa and when par did not exceed 1200 µmol m 2 s 1 iii the absolute value of tc was the most suitable thermal indicator in all treatments during fruit growth stage and iv the ability of tc to estimate gs improved when rw and rdi strategies were used compared with tw fi 5 conclusion the robustness of the different thermal indices tc tc ta and cwsi for estimating stomatal conductance of grapefruit trees was tested for the first time on several thermal data intervals and environmental conditions the results suggested that thermal indices gs correlations had the highest degree of correlation when preceding 60 min thermal average data vpdglobal and par1200 were considered in these time intervals and environmental conditions trees under deficit irrigation and those irrigated with reclaimed water showed an increase in the thermal indices gs r2 values we also found the most suitable thermal indicator in each of the different phenological stages and irrigation treatments studied normalised thermal indices were the most robust during flowering sprouting p1 and the absolute values of tc during fruit growth phenological stage p2 independently of quality of the irrigation source and the amount of water applied nevertheless the maximum variance explanation achieved was around 70 due to among other factors the gs measurements were performed in the middle part of the tree canopy while irt sensors were placed above the canopy thus in future research the precision of these relationships should be improved by determining the proper part of the tree where gs and tc should be measured then it would be interesting to test the capacity of the model for scheduling irrigation and or estimation of the threshold of gs or tc at which irrigation should be
