secondary one we investigate if there is a better fit for this system in doing so we concentrate on the difference in performance made by using a combination of the gaussian and the jonswap models in comparison to that of using two jonswap models the rest of the paper is structured as follows section 2 explains local measurements while section 3 summarizes the methodology results and discussion can be found in section 4 followed by the conclusion in section 5 2 local measurements this study benefits from the same dataset used by akbari et al 2019 that being said we used two series of measurements over ten stations in the gulf of oman 1 2006 07 and 2016 perfomed to support national port development plans panahi et al 2017 both measurement projects used nortek acoustic wave and current profiler awac 2018 guedes soares and henriques 1998 the location of such stations is summarized in table 1 and illustrated in fig 1 after applying the basic settings following those proposed by panahi et al 2015 excluding correlated events and those unimodal spectra which seem to be bimodal guedes soares and nolasco 1992 it resulted in the total of 612 spectra then the torsethaugen 1993 criterion was applied to categorize if the primary or the secondary system dominates as will be discussed in more detail in section 4 this led to a total of 388 spectra dominated by the primary system and 224 ones dominated by the secondary one over two series of measurements it should be noted that the share of representative double peaked spectra in the region considering the location of the measurement stations was about 30 3 calibration methodology as mentioned earlier wave spectra could be classified into 1 single peaked spectra in which one wave system prevails and only one peak is pronounced 2 double peaked spectra in which two wave systems co exist and two peaks are represented and 3 multi peaked spectra that have more than two pronounced peaks as the result of co existence of multiple swell systems lucas et al 2011 however for the class of double peaked spectra in this context it has been argued that the primary system is always a swell one while the secondary system could be either a swell or wind sea system lucas et al 2011 however if the non linear interaction between the wind waves and the swell system is negligible then the total spectrum could be expressed as the sum of two separate frequency spectra each responsible for an individual system therefore we will have the following 1 s f s 1 f s 2 f in which s 1 f and s 2 f represent primary and secondary systems respectively to analyze the effectiveness of the gaussian model in double peaked spectra we examined two models for the first one we implemented the combination of two jonswap models which we call it jj for the second model we introduced a combination of the gaussian model for the primary system and the jonswap model for the secondary one that we call it gj the formulations for the gaussian and

4 m 0 in which m 0 is the zeroth order moment of the area under the wave spectrum in this study we benefited from a new calibration method introduced by akbrai et al 2019 as illustrated in fig 2 this is based on satisfying the following equation as it stands for energy conservation 4 h s 2 h s 1 2 h s 2 2 where h s 1 and h s 2 stand for significant wave height of primary and secondary systems contributing to a double peaked spectrum respectively considering fig 2 we have three free independent variables one significant wave height and two peak frequencies while the other significant wave height should be calculated from the first one concerning eq 4 however to initialize h s 1 and h s 2 we need to combine eq 4 with the two following equations for jj and gj which are arranged based on eq 2 and eq 3 respectively akbari et al 2019 5 s 1 g f p 1 s 2 j f p 2 s f p 1 s f p 2 h s 1 2 h s 2 2 f p 2 f p 1 1 15 0 1688 γ 2 0 925 1 909 γ 2 γ 1 1 15 0 1688 γ 1 0 925 1 909 γ 1 γ 2 6 s 1 j f p 1

values for calibration in order to reach the best fit deviation index d i was implemented introduced by liu 1983 and later widely used by researchers e g guedes soares and henriques 1998 as follows 7 d i 1 n j 1 n i 1 m 100 s f i s f i s f i s f i δ f m 0 where m is the number of frequencies for each spectrum j represented with frequency intervals δ f the total error d i is the mean error for all measured spectra in addition in this normalized weighted index s stands for the calibrated spectrum and s is the measured one this error as shown in fig 2 will be calculated for each spectrum to find the best set of parameters with the minimum total error 4 results and discussions we firstly calibrated jj and gj on the whole dataset investigations confirmed better performance of gj compared to jj here the best combination of tuning parameters for gj was σ 1 g 0 028 γ 2 j 1 23 with d i 3 08 while it was γ 1 j 1 01 γ 2 j 1 22 with d i 5 75 for jj however to go through details we categorized measured spectra into four groups based on being dominated by the primary or the secondary system and having an overlap or not to classify based on the dominance of the primary or the secondary system we applied the criterion proposed by torsethaugen 1993 by introducing a spectral peak period for fully developed sea at the actual location it was discussed that if the period of the primary peak is higher than this value the spectrum would be governed by the primary system swell dominated in terms of torsethaugen research otherwise it would be a secondary system dominated spectrum wind sea dominated in terms of torsethaugen research or 8 t p a f h s 1 3 primary system dominated s w e l l d o m i n a t e d e l s e secondary system dominated in which a f should be calibrated using gj as the base considering its better performance we extracted the energy share of the primary and the secondary systems based on that we drew the energy share of the primary system indicted by h s 1 2 over the total wave energy indicated by h s 2 with respect to the parameter introduced by torsethaugen t p h s 1 3 or a f as shown in fig 3 it is evident that the value of a f 6 6 coincides with h s 1 h s 2 0 5 red point in fig 3 and for the rest of the data it is distributed over a wide range of a f from 4 5 to 14 0 double headed arrow in fig 3 consequently we argue that a f 6 6 could be used in eq 8 to distinguish between different spectra in terms of being dominated by the primary or the secondary system at the region under study although this approach was used by other researchers e g ewans et al 2006 the wide range of distribution is noticeable and could suggest an avenue for future studies however as it was not the focus of this study we kept it the way it was we further divided spectra into those with or without overlap when drawing separate spectra following the calibration method we can see events in which s 1 f or s 2 f have clear presence near the peak frequency of the other system i e the spectral density of one system at the peak frequency of another system is at least 10 of the observed peak spectral density of the other system based on this definition we highlighted events with overlapped systems in contrast there are events in which systems weaken near the peak frequency of the other one we called them non overlapped systems of course the output of this criterion is directly affected by the type of spectra used in the calibration here considering the better performance of gj we categorized spectra based on that this ends up with a more restrictive measure for separation in other words using a gj model the average difference between the frequencies of two peaks should be lower than the one using jj to be considered an overlapped double peaked spectrum this resulted in identifying about 10 of the spectra as overlapped 4 1 illustrative spectra 4 1 1 typical non overlapped spectra here representation of typical non overlapped spectra dominated by the primary and the secondary systems using jj and gj is investigated looking at fig 4 1 and 3 it is obvious that using jj results in an unrealistic increase of the spectral density irrespective of the dominant system in the meantime using jj results in lower peak frequency for the primary peak on the other hand using gj as illustrated in fig 4 2 and 4 reflects reasonable overall accuracy here the primary system is better identified with the gaussian than the jonswap model generally this improvement should be assessed from two perspectives the shape of the model around the peak and its right hand side tails in the case of non overlapped systems in fact this is the shape of the gaussian model which makes this significant improvement in other words the gaussian model represents a wide and symmetric distribution around its peak frequency while this is not the case for the jonswap model irrespective of its enhancement factor this characteristic slightly complemented by a shorter tail makes the gaussian model a better fit for these typical double peaked spectra in other words for the jonswap model its narrow form makes it difficult to adjust to the form of the primary peak which is exacerbated by the long presence of its tail which consequently costs a substantial shift of the peak frequency to the left this right hand side extension of the jonswap model could affect the accuracy of representing the secondary system in a positive or negative way but the contribution is very limited considering the non overlapped characteristic of such spectra obviously with non overlapped systems such contribution becomes clearer by the dominance of the primary system as in this case this limited overlap is higher than those spectra which are dominated by the secondary system on the other hand for the secondary system it is well represented by the jonswap model although it resulted in over and underestimation fig 4 2 and 4 however since the total wave energy is conserved in the calibration procedure this switch to the gaussian model for the primary system slightly affects the performance of the jonswap model for the secondary system the general effect of using the gaussian model for the primary system on the performance of the jonswap model in representing the secondary system will be discussed in subsection 4 2 in details 4 1 2 typical overlapped spectra typical overlapped spectra dominated by primary and secondary systems are represented in fig 5 comparing fig 5 1 and 3 it is obvious that the tail of the jonswap model significantly affects the secondary system especially if the double peaked spectrum is dominated by the primary system however this is limited using the gaussian model for the primary system fig 5 2 and 4 which improves the representation of the primary system while affecting the secondary system as well similar to the case of the non overlapped system the characteristic of the jonswap model resulted in an unrealistic increase in the spectral density of the primary system using jj as mentioned earlier comparing fig 4 2 and 4 with fig 5 2 and 4 it seems that using gj for the overlapped systems is of higher importance than non overlapped systems this is due to the fact that in non overlap spectra the representative spectrum contributes more to the shape of the primary system while in the overlapped spectra it affects both shape and share of the primary system in the secondary one these two aspects contribute to the lower performance of jj as shown in fig 5 1 and 3 in case of using the jonswap model for the primary system the peak frequency of this system shifts to the left even more than what was undergone in non overlapped systems this is limited by using the gaussian model as it proposes a symmetric shape around the observed peak frequency for the primary system with a limited tail so even with an overlapped system this limit on contribution improves the total accuracy here using gj for such overlapped systems significantly improved the overall performance as well as the performance of representing individual systems however the general trend will be discussed in subsection 4 2 in detail it is evident that the gaussian model outperforms the jonswap model in representing the primary system on the other hand the secondary system and its tail are well regenerated by the jonswap model for both the overlapped and non overlapped conditions figs 4 and 5 here it should be noted that some well known models e g the bretschneider and the pierson moskowitz could be restored by calibrating the jonswap model considering such by calibrating the jonswap model we have considered such models however to recheck different combinations of spectra and investigate the importance of the selected spectrum for the secondary system the gaussian model was also assigned to the secondary system to form gg in this case the calibrated spectrum deviates from the measurement especially for those dominated by the secondary system as shown in fig 6 here it is obvious that the right hand tail of the measured spectrum cannot be well represented by the gaussian model while as shown in fig 4 2 and 5 2 it is well fitted to the jonswap model for the non overlapped spectrum in fig 6 1 the peak frequency of the second system is increased to get a better fit on the right hand tail yet the agreement between the calibrated and the recorded spectra is weaker than what is represented in fig 4 2 by gj the case is even worse for the overlapped spectrum in fig 6 2 in comparison to fig 5 2 where the primary peak has been nearly vanished in the fitted spectrum using gg although using the gaussian instead of the jonswap model is not appropriate for the secondary system it is strongly advised for the primary system 4 2 assessment of adjusted inputs 4 2 1 peak frequencies for the case double peaked spectra dominated by the primary system adjusted peak frequencies are drawn versus the observed ones in fig 7 comparing fig 7 1 and 2 it indicates that gj slightly decreases the accuracy of the peak frequency of the secondary system in high values higher than 0 22 hz while it results in lower variance and the same accuracy for those lower than 0 22 hz comparing fig 7 3 and 4 gj spectrum decreases shift of the peak frequency of the primary system to the left when compared to jj however the peak frequency is often underestimated using either jj or gj although for both the primary and the secondary peaks adjusted peak frequencies using jj or gj are generally less than the observed values it is clear that this is more significant in case of those spectra dominated by the primary peak for the case double peaked spectra dominated by the secondary system adjusted peak frequencies are drawn versus the observed ones in fig 8 comparing fig 8 1 and 2 it seems that gj slightly decreases the accuracy of the peak frequency of the secondary peak in high values higher than 0 22 hz as it was the case for double peaked spectra dominated by the primary peak in the meantime it does not significantly affect the accuracy of the peak frequency lower than 0 22 hz comparing fig 8 3 and 4 gj spectrum significantly decreases the shift of the peak frequency of the primary system to the left when compared to jj even in comparison to its performance in the case of double peaked spectra dominated by the primary system in other words the false left shift of the primary peak frequency existed even using gj in double peaked spectra dominated by the primary system was approximately resolved in this type of spectra 4 2 2 peak spectral densities for the peak spectral densities in double peaked spectra dominated by the primary system results are shown in fig 9 comparing fig 9 1 and 2 it seems that using gj does not affect the secondary peak spectral density when compared to jj for the secondary system so those limited negative effect of using gj for the peak frequency of the secondary system is not the case for its peak spectral density comparing fig 9 3 and 4 the significant impact of using gj over jj is evident while using jj results in overestimation of the peak spectral density for the primary system it is resolved with gj as the result comparing fig 9 5 and 6 indicates that the ratio of peak spectral densities is preserved using gj while it was overestimated using jj this is critical especially with respect to the calibration methods which use it as an input e g guedes soares 1984 for the peak spectral densities in double peaked spectra dominated by the primary system results are shown in fig 10 comparing fig 10 1 and 2 it seems that using gj improves the variance of secondary peak spectral density when compared to jj in the meantime the adjusted spectral ordinate is slightly underestimated using jj comparing fig 10 3 and 4 the significant impact of using gj over jj on secondary peak spectral density is evident this is very similar to its effect on secondary peak spectral density for double peaked spectra dominated by the primary system here the adjusted spectral ordinate is overestimated to some extent using jj as the consequence we could assume benefiting from a better ratio of peak spectral densities using gj as shown in fig 10 5 and 6 in fact overestimation of the peak spectral ordinate of the primary peak in jj method fig 10 3 leads to underestimated value for the secondary peak fig 10 1 in other words since the total wave energy is conserved adjusting a higher energy to one part results in a lower energy for the other part therefore the energy sharing between two systems is deteriorated using unsuitable spectra 4 3 overall assessment of adjusted inputs and outputs results are summarized in table 2 for different categories of spectra using jj and gj it is obvious that using the gaussian model for the primary system significantly improves the accuracy of the peak frequency of the primary system especially with spectra dominated by the primary system on the other hand using the gaussian model slightly decreases the accuracy of the peak frequency of the secondary system this is the same for spectra dominated by primary and secondary systems also this pattern is approximately similar for peak spectral densities using the gaussian model resulted in significant improvement of peak spectral density of the primary system especially in those dominated by the primary system here using the gaussian model also improved the performance of the jonswap model for the secondary system in spectra dominated by the primary system although using the gaussian model for the primary system sometimes decreased the performance of the jonswap model in representing the secondary system the overall error decreases about 50 using gj this is summarized in table 3 unsurprisingly this improvement is higher in spectra dominated by the primary system this clearly shows the inability of the jonswap model in representing the primary system which is exacerbated by increasing the contribution of the energy of the primary system to the double peaked spectrum if the gaussian model is applied to both systems case of gg the di error for the secondary and primary dominated systems will be 6 393 and 5 232 respectively this means that improper using of the gaussian model for the secondary system will significantly increase the error this is similar to improper application of the jonswap model for the primary system however analyses prove that for the secondary system dominated spectra it becomes more important to use the jonswap model for the secondary system similarly for the primary system dominated spectra it is more important to use the gaussian model for the primary system 5 conclusion while the primary system in double peak spectra is always governed by the swell system the secondary system could be a swell or a wind sea system in this study we focused on the primary system to examine if there is any substantial difference between these two systems which could affect the performance of calibrated spectra in doing so we calibrated two types of double peak spectrum for the first series of calibration we investigated the typical combination of two jonswap models called jj in this study while for the second series we replaced the one responsible for the primary system with the gaussian model called gj in this study investigations benefitted from two series of measurements in the northern parts of the gulf of oman i e 2006 2007 and 2016 outputs suggest that using the gaussian model for the primary system is essential as it increases the overall performance of calibrated double peaked spectra about 50 which is more obvious in those dominated by the primary system here two main differences of the gaussian model compared to the jonswap model make it a better fit for the primary system the shape of the primary peak is wide and symmetric close to the peak here while the jonswap model enforces an asymmetric shape it is not the case with the gaussian model besides it is evident that the long right hand side tail of the jonswap model overestimates the contribution of the primary system to the secondary one as the performance of jj significantly decreases in those overlapped spectra dominated by the primary system however the peak frequency of the primary system is often underestimated using either jj or gj which should be the focus of future studies author contribution statement hassan akbari conceptualization methodology

eq 2 and eq 3 respectively akbari et al 2019 5 s 1 g f p 1 s 2 j f p 2 s f p 1 s f p 2 h s 1 2 h s 2 2 f p 2 f p 1 1 15 0 1688 γ 2 0 925 1 909 γ 2 γ 1 1 15 0 1688 γ 1 0 925 1 909 γ 1 γ 2 6 s 1 j f p 1

values for calibration in order to reach the best fit deviation index d i was implemented introduced by liu 1983 and later widely used by researchers e g guedes soares and henriques 1998 as follows 7 d i 1 n j 1 n i 1 m 100 s f i s f i s f i s f i δ f m 0 where m is the number of frequencies for each spectrum j represented with frequency intervals δ f the total error d i is the mean error for all measured spectra in addition in this normalized weighted index s stands for the calibrated spectrum and s is the measured one this error as shown in fig 2 will be calculated for each spectrum to find the best set of parameters with the minimum total error 4 results and discussions we firstly calibrated jj and gj on the whole dataset investigations confirmed better performance of gj compared to jj here the best combination of tuning parameters for gj was σ 1 g 0 028 γ 2 j 1 23 with d i 3 08 while it was γ 1 j 1 01 γ 2 j 1 22 with d i 5 75 for jj however to go through details we categorized measured spectra into four groups based on being dominated by the primary or the secondary system and having an overlap or not to classify based on the dominance of the primary or the secondary system we applied the criterion proposed by torsethaugen 1993 by introducing a spectral peak period for fully developed sea at the actual location it was discussed that if the period of the primary peak is higher than this value the spectrum would be governed by the primary system swell dominated in terms of torsethaugen research otherwise it would be a secondary system dominated spectrum wind sea dominated in terms of torsethaugen research or 8 t p a f h s 1 3 primary system dominated s w e l l d o m i n a t e d e l s e secondary system dominated in which a f should be calibrated using gj as the base considering its better performance we extracted the energy share of the primary and the secondary systems based on that we drew the energy share of the primary system indicted by h s 1 2 over the total wave energy indicated by h s 2 with respect to the parameter introduced by torsethaugen t p h s 1 3 or a f as shown in fig 3 it is evident that the value of a f 6 6 coincides with h s 1 h s 2 0 5 red point in fig 3 and for the rest of the data it is distributed over a wide range of a f from 4 5 to 14 0 double headed arrow in fig 3 consequently we argue that a f 6 6 could be used in eq 8 to distinguish between different spectra in terms of being dominated by the primary or the secondary system at the region under study although this approach was used by other researchers e g ewans et al 2006 the wide range of distribution is noticeable and could suggest an avenue for future studies however as it was not the focus of this study we kept it the way it was we further divided spectra into those with or without overlap when drawing separate spectra following the calibration method we can see events in which s 1 f or s 2 f have clear presence near the peak frequency of the other system i e the spectral density of one system at the peak frequency of another system is at least 10 of the observed peak spectral density of the other system based on this definition we highlighted events with overlapped systems in contrast there are events in which systems weaken near the peak frequency of the other one we called them non overlapped systems of course the output of this criterion is directly affected by the type of spectra used in the calibration here considering the better performance of gj we categorized spectra based on that this ends up with a more restrictive measure for separation in other words using a gj model the average difference between the frequencies of two peaks should be lower than the one using jj to be considered an overlapped double peaked spectrum this resulted in identifying about 10 of the spectra as overlapped 4 1 illustrative spectra 4 1 1 typical non overlapped spectra here representation of typical non overlapped spectra dominated by the primary and the secondary systems using jj and gj is investigated looking at fig 4 1 and 3 it is obvious that using jj results in an unrealistic increase of the spectral density irrespective of the dominant system in the meantime using jj results in lower peak frequency for the primary peak on the other hand using gj as illustrated in fig 4 2 and 4 reflects reasonable overall accuracy here the primary system is better identified with the gaussian than the jonswap model generally this improvement should be assessed from two perspectives the shape of the model around the peak and its right hand side tails in the case of non overlapped systems in fact this is the shape of the gaussian model which makes this significant improvement in other words the gaussian model represents a wide and symmetric distribution around its peak frequency while this is not the case for the jonswap model irrespective of its enhancement factor this characteristic slightly complemented by a shorter tail makes the gaussian model a better fit for these typical double peaked spectra in other words for the jonswap model its narrow form makes it difficult to adjust to the form of the primary peak which is exacerbated by the long presence of its tail which consequently costs a substantial shift of the peak frequency to the left this right hand side extension of the jonswap model could affect the accuracy of representing the secondary system in a positive or negative way but the contribution is very limited considering the non overlapped characteristic of such spectra obviously with non overlapped systems such contribution becomes clearer by the dominance of the primary system as in this case this limited overlap is higher than those spectra which are dominated by the secondary system on the other hand for the secondary system it is well represented by the jonswap model although it resulted in over and underestimation fig 4 2 and 4 however since the total wave energy is conserved in the calibration procedure this switch to the gaussian model for the primary system slightly affects the performance of the jonswap model for the secondary system the general effect of using the gaussian model for the primary system on the performance of the jonswap model in representing the secondary system will be discussed in subsection 4 2 in details 4 1 2 typical overlapped spectra typical overlapped spectra dominated by primary and secondary systems are represented in fig 5 comparing fig 5 1 and 3 it is obvious that the tail of the jonswap model significantly affects the secondary system especially if the double peaked spectrum is dominated by the primary system however this is limited using the gaussian model for the primary system fig 5 2 and 4 which improves the representation of the primary system while affecting the secondary system as well similar to the case of the non overlapped system the characteristic of the jonswap model resulted in an unrealistic increase in the spectral density of the primary system using jj as mentioned earlier comparing fig 4 2 and 4 with fig 5 2 and 4 it seems that using gj for the overlapped systems is of higher importance than non overlapped systems this is due to the fact that in non overlap spectra the representative spectrum contributes more to the shape of the primary system while in the overlapped spectra it affects both shape and share of the primary system in the secondary one these two aspects contribute to the lower performance of jj as shown in fig 5 1 and 3 in case of using the jonswap model for the primary system the peak frequency of this system shifts to the left even more than what was undergone in non overlapped systems this is limited by using the gaussian model as it proposes a symmetric shape around the observed peak frequency for the primary system with a limited tail so even with an overlapped system this limit on contribution improves the total accuracy here using gj for such overlapped systems significantly improved the overall performance as well as the performance of representing individual systems however the general trend will be discussed in subsection 4 2 in detail it is evident that the gaussian model outperforms the jonswap model in representing the primary system on the other hand the secondary system and its tail are well regenerated by the jonswap model for both the overlapped and non overlapped conditions figs 4 and 5 here it should be noted that some well known models e g the bretschneider and the pierson moskowitz could be restored by calibrating the jonswap model considering such by calibrating the jonswap model we have considered such models however to recheck different combinations of spectra and investigate the importance of the selected spectrum for the secondary system the gaussian model was also assigned to the secondary system to form gg in this case the calibrated spectrum deviates from the measurement especially for those dominated by the secondary system as shown in fig 6 here it is obvious that the right hand tail of the measured spectrum cannot be well represented by the gaussian model while as shown in fig 4 2 and 5 2 it is well fitted to the jonswap model for the non overlapped spectrum in fig 6 1 the peak frequency of the second system is increased to get a better fit on the right hand tail yet the agreement between the calibrated and the recorded spectra is weaker than what is represented in fig 4 2 by gj the case is even worse for the overlapped spectrum in fig 6 2 in comparison to fig 5 2 where the primary peak has been nearly vanished in the fitted spectrum using gg although using the gaussian instead of the jonswap model is not appropriate for the secondary system it is strongly advised for the primary system 4 2 assessment of adjusted inputs 4 2 1 peak frequencies for the case double peaked spectra dominated by the primary system adjusted peak frequencies are drawn versus the observed ones in fig 7 comparing fig 7 1 and 2 it indicates that gj slightly decreases the accuracy of the peak frequency of the secondary system in high values higher than 0 22 hz while it results in lower variance and the same accuracy for those lower than 0 22 hz comparing fig 7 3 and 4 gj spectrum decreases shift of the peak frequency of the primary system to the left when compared to jj however the peak frequency is often underestimated using either jj or gj although for both the primary and the secondary peaks adjusted peak frequencies using jj or gj are generally less than the observed values it is clear that this is more significant in case of those spectra dominated by the primary peak for the case double peaked spectra dominated by the secondary system adjusted peak frequencies are drawn versus the observed ones in fig 8 comparing fig 8 1 and 2 it seems that gj slightly decreases the accuracy of the peak frequency of the secondary peak in high values higher than 0 22 hz as it was the case for double peaked spectra dominated by the primary peak in the meantime it does not significantly affect the accuracy of the peak frequency lower than 0 22 hz comparing fig 8 3 and 4 gj spectrum significantly decreases the shift of the peak frequency of the primary system to the left when compared to jj even in comparison to its performance in the case of double peaked spectra dominated by the primary system in other words the false left shift of the primary peak frequency existed even using gj in double peaked spectra dominated by the primary system was approximately resolved in this type of spectra 4 2 2 peak spectral densities for the peak spectral densities in double peaked spectra dominated by the primary system results are shown in fig 9 comparing fig 9 1 and 2 it seems that using gj does not affect the secondary peak spectral density when compared to jj for the secondary system so those limited negative effect of using gj for the peak frequency of the secondary system is not the case for its peak spectral density comparing fig 9 3 and 4 the significant impact of using gj over jj is evident while using jj results in overestimation of the peak spectral density for the primary system it is resolved with gj as the result comparing fig 9 5 and 6 indicates that the ratio of peak spectral densities is preserved using gj while it was overestimated using jj this is critical especially with respect to the calibration methods which use it as an input e g guedes soares 1984 for the peak spectral densities in double peaked spectra dominated by the primary system results are shown in fig 10 comparing fig 10 1 and 2 it seems that using gj improves the variance of secondary peak spectral density when compared to jj in the meantime the adjusted spectral ordinate is slightly underestimated using jj comparing fig 10 3 and 4 the significant impact of using gj over jj on secondary peak spectral density is evident this is very similar to its effect on secondary peak spectral density for double peaked spectra dominated by the primary system here the adjusted spectral ordinate is overestimated to some extent using jj as the consequence we could assume benefiting from a better ratio of peak spectral densities using gj as shown in fig 10 5 and 6 in fact overestimation of the peak spectral ordinate of the primary peak in jj method fig 10 3 leads to underestimated value for the secondary peak fig 10 1 in other words since the total wave energy is conserved adjusting a higher energy to one part results in a lower energy for the other part therefore the energy sharing between two systems is deteriorated using unsuitable spectra 4 3 overall assessment of adjusted inputs and outputs results are summarized in table 2 for different categories of spectra using jj and gj it is obvious that using the gaussian model for the primary system significantly improves the accuracy of the peak frequency of the primary system especially with spectra dominated by the primary system on the other hand using the gaussian model slightly decreases the accuracy of the peak frequency of the secondary system this is the same for spectra dominated by primary and secondary systems also this pattern is approximately similar for peak spectral densities using the gaussian model resulted in significant improvement of peak spectral density of the primary system especially in those dominated by the primary system here using the gaussian model also improved the performance of the jonswap model for the secondary system in spectra dominated by the primary system although using the gaussian model for the primary system sometimes decreased the performance of the jonswap model in representing the secondary system the overall error decreases about 50 using gj this is summarized in table 3 unsurprisingly this improvement is higher in spectra dominated by the primary system this clearly shows the inability of the jonswap model in representing the primary system which is exacerbated by increasing the contribution of the energy of the primary system to the double peaked spectrum if the gaussian model is applied to both systems case of gg the di error for the secondary and primary dominated systems will be 6 393 and 5 232 respectively this means that improper using of the gaussian model for the secondary system will significantly increase the error this is similar to improper application of the jonswap model for the primary system however analyses prove that for the secondary system dominated spectra it becomes more important to use the jonswap model for the secondary system similarly for the primary system dominated spectra it is more important to use the gaussian model for the primary system 5 conclusion while the primary system in double peak spectra is always governed by the swell system the secondary system could be a swell or a wind sea system in this study we focused on the primary system to examine if there is any substantial difference between these two systems which could affect the performance of calibrated spectra in doing so we calibrated two types of double peak spectrum for the first series of calibration we investigated the typical combination of two jonswap models called jj in this study while for the second series we replaced the one responsible for the primary system with the gaussian model called gj in this study investigations benefitted from two series of measurements in the northern parts of the gulf of oman i e 2006 2007 and 2016 outputs suggest that using the gaussian model for the primary system is essential as it increases the overall performance of calibrated double peaked spectra about 50 which is more obvious in those dominated by the primary system here two main differences of the gaussian model compared to the jonswap model make it a better fit for the primary system the shape of the primary peak is wide and symmetric close to the peak here while the jonswap model enforces an asymmetric shape it is not the case with the gaussian model besides it is evident that the long right hand side tail of the jonswap model overestimates the contribution of the primary system to the secondary one as the performance of jj significantly decreases in those overlapped spectra dominated by the primary system however the peak frequency of the primary system is often underestimated using either jj or gj which should be the focus of future studies author contribution statement hassan akbari conceptualization methodology

22086,sea ice is the major source of loading for structural design in cold regions the intrinsic properties of sea ice are generally associated with high degrees of uncertainty due to ice growth taking place during different environmental conditions for different areas the thickness ice strength coefficient and flexural strength of sea ice are the parameters for the calculation of ice loads the aim of the present paper is to investigate the uncertainties associated with the ice loads which are acting on vertical and sloping structures as calculated by the formulations in the iso 19906 standard the effect of correlation between the key parameters is investigated by using the nataf transformation model monte carlo simulation techniques are applied in order to assess the uncertainties associated with the global ice loads due to ice structure interaction it is found that for increasing values of the positive correlation between the sea ice properties the uncertainties of the global ice forces will increase the fractile for both vertical and sloping structures approximately up to 40 and 60 from the case with zero correlation moreover for sloping structures higher values of the sloping angles imply increasing levels of uncertainty associated with the ice loads keywords ice loads ice structure interaction probabilistic analysis iso standard 1 introduction the inherent mechanism of ice structure interaction is a complex phenomenon owing to the sea ice properties and interaction process structures in the arctic and subarctic regions are generally subjected to drifting ice during their time in operation especially during the winter season the magnitude of ice loads is typically related to the failure mechanisms of sea ice itself different structural configurations imply different failure modes of the sea ice which are associated with relevant types of ice breaking process a variety of vertical and sloping structures are typically employed in connection with structural applications such as ships barges gravity base structures gbs legs lighthouses etc considering this variety the characteristics of the sea ice properties are inherently associated with large uncertainties this implies that representation of the ice properties and load coefficients as random variables in order to establish a credible probabilistic models is essential based on such probabilistic models structural reliability analysis procedures can be applied in order to quantify the level of safety and integrity of structures in these regions bekker et al 2011b during ice structure interaction two different and distinct failure mechanisms are observed which correspond to the flexural versus the crushing failure mode for vertical structures the crushing mode is dominating the picture due to confinement of the ice during interaction however the loading is significantly reduced when the structural geometry is changed from a vertical to a sloping configuration this is due to a transition from a crushing to the bending failure mode accordingly this feature can be utilized when performing design of arctic and subarctic structures in order to obtain more economic structures bruun and gudmestad 2006 inherently sea ice properties depend on the ice growth conditions related to the climate in a given region sea ice samples are typically collected from the target area in order to estimate the sea ice properties by means of field and laboratory tests the intrinsic properties of sea ice are associated with uncertainties according to the ice features and the ice conditions e g temperature salinity density porosity grain size and orientation strub klein 2017 the design of arctic and subarctic offshore structures to withstand the ice loading requires that physical as well as mechanical data of sea ice are available which can be collected separately for physical property of sea ice the ice draft or ice thickness is the main factor which dominates the ice loading for both vertical and sloping structures it can be measured by different methods such as satellites submarines upward looking sonar uls helicopter borne electromagnetic instruments hem etc different measurement methods provide different accuracy according to the properties of each instrument for instance satellites measurements of sea ice can cover a large area but the accuracy is not the best the hem can give information about the sea ice thickness only along the flying track of the helicopter the precision of the hem method for ice thickness measurement depends on instrumental noise and flying height pfaffling et al 2007 furthermore the average daily air temperature from the local measurement stations can be applied with the ice growth model to estimate the level ice thickness in the vicinity area li et al 2016 on the other hand the mechanical properties of sea ice such as flexural strength uniaxial strength ice strength coefficient can only be obtained from experiments or measurements in the field or in the laboratory for vertical structures zvyagin 2015 introduced an analytical method for the purpose of probabilistic modelling in relation to ice pressure for vertical structures according to the formulation in the iso standard iso 2010 the thickness and strength coefficient of sea ice were considered as random variables based on the application of a lognormal distribution for both parameters for the purpose of investigating the uncertainty associated with the calculated ice pressure for sloping structure a similar analysis can be performed based on identification of the most important parameters that enter the calculations it is found that the flexural strength ice thickness accumulation of ice rubble and friction coefficients between the sea ice and structures are the dominant quantities for the loading on sloping structures ranta et al 2018 studied the failure of level ice pushing against inclined structures by performing finite discrete element analyses in order to identify the ice failure processes by deterministic and probabilistic methods the results showed that the ice thickness has a strong effect on the resulting ice load in the case of deterministic analysis the initial condition of incoming ice velocity for the simulation model has a significant influence on the ice load estimation in the probabilistic analysis it was found that the sample size of the simulated ice data has a significant effect on the accuracy of ice load estimation the sample size of ice load data for the numerical simulations is relevant for calculation of mean ice load standard deviation and maximum load as obtained from the time domain simulation ayubian et al 2016 performed a probabilistic assessment of the ice loading on vertical structures by application of monte carlo simulation the ice thickness and ice strength coefficients of sea ice were treated as the key parameters and were represented by random variables when calculation the exceedance probability for different levels of the ice load when performing structural reliability analysis it is important to represent the correlation between the sea ice properties in a proper way due to the strong influence on the resulting loading there are several existing national and international standards for determination of the ice loads on offshore structures such as the american api rp 2n 1995 the canadian csa s471 04 2004 the chinese code q hsn 30002002 2002 the iso standard iso 19906 the russian snip code 2 06 04 82 1995 and the russian vsn code 41 88 1988 thijssen et al 2014 frederking 2012 studied the ice pressure on vertical structures resulting from application of different standards i e api csa iso and snip the study was performed based on a deterministic analysis for three different types of structures i e with slender intermediate and wide loading surfaces as a result he recommended that the canadian csa s6 06 canadian highway bridge design code is suitable for slender and intermediate structures and the canadian csa s471 04 is suitable for wide structures for existing offshore structures bekker et al 2011a studied the global ice loads acting on structures in the okhotsk sea for oil and gas fields such as orlan sakhalin i piltun astohsky a b molikpaq lunsky a and sakhlin ii comparison was made between different national and international design guidelines and codes as a result ice loads based on the snip and vsn standards were found to be higher than those computed based on the api csa and iso standards for a monopile structure however for ice loads acting on multi leg structures the snip and vsn standards provide higher values in comparison with loads from the other codes in order to design offshore structures all the uncertainties have to be considered this is required in order to ensure that the structures will be able to perform their intended function with sufficient confidence the traditional approach in order to deal with uncertainties is to utilize conservative value of the uncertain quantities or safety factors within a deterministic design framework however a statistical formulation is also needed owing to the large uncertainties associated with the underlying parameters of the sea ice properties a reliability based approach will be of benefit in order to enhance accuracy associated with prediction of extreme events and also permits to identify proper values of the underlying parameters that define the design values of the ice loading wang et al 2011 for numerical simulation of ice loading the discrete element modeling dem approach can be utilized tuhkuri and polojärvi 2018 there are serval advantages of such a modeling approach practically it can be employed to simulate the ice load on the structures in order to identify the influence of the relevant parameters before performing the physical experiments themselves due to the high cost and potential hazard associated with such experiments the numerical studies provides multiple benefits moreover the discrete element modeling approach is widely being used for estimation of design ice loads on the offshore structures this allows simulation of different design scenarios e g in terms of alternative structural configurations and ice conditions dem can be applied for simulation of both two and three dimensional cases and it allows analysis of both simple and complex ice structures interaction phenomena however only two dimensional solutions has no appropriate defined breaking pattern for complex structures with irregular geometry such as ship hulls the discrete element modeling approach has been widely applied for estimation of ice loads hisette et al 2017 lau et al 2011 however this approach requires extensive computer resources and such simulations are rather time consuming typically upper bound values of the loads are obtained based on extremely severe combinations of the relevant input simulation parameters alternatively repeated simulations with discrete elements models can be performed with different values of the relevant input parameters which results in significant computational efforts the objective of this work is to investigate the uncertainty associated with global ice loads based on the formulation given in the iso standard which has been widely using within the offshore industry it is emphasized that in the present study only the statistical scatter of the parameters which are input to calculation of pressure and load are considered while the model uncertainty associated with the formulation itself is not addressed the ice structure interaction is split into two different scenarios i e vertical versus sloping structures the effects of correlation between key load parameters are accounted for by application of the nataf transformation model in order to generate the joint probability distribution based on data obtained from field experiments furthermore the monte carlo simulation technique is applied in order to assess the uncertainties associated with the ice pressure and global ice load for the two different scenarios 2 environmental condition 2 1 ice thickness ice thickness is the most important parameter when it comes to the resulting magnitude of the global loading on a structure with a given geometry the present study focuses on first year sea ice conditions for which the ice thickness conditions are different from multi year ice the data related to the maximum annual thickness of level ice is obtained from estimation of air temperature at rödkallen meteorological station shmi 2019 in northern gulf of bothnia sea this station can be used to estimate the ice thickness for the norströmsgrund lighthouse which is located 23 6 km in north east direction of the station the observation of the level ice thickness has been measured since 1912 however a detailed documentation of the measurement sites is not available possibly the measurement sites might have been moved or the environment has changed during the extended observation period ronkainen et al 2018 for the present research the values of maximum annual level ice thickness from 1952 to 2015 are obtained from li et al 2016 from 2016 to 2018 the ice growth model of zubov 1943 which is the same procedure as applied by li et al 2016 is employed in order to estimate the annual maximum values of level ice thickness the formulation of the ice growth prediction by zubov model is given in equation 1 1 h i 2 50 h i 8 f d d where h i denotes the estimated level ice thickness fdd is the accumulated freezing degree days which is calculated from the daily average temperature t d and the freezing temperature of sea water t f in the unit of celsius degree co as given in equation 2 2 f d d t f t d it is sufficient to include the daily average temperature below the freezing point of water the examples of estimation of the level ice thickness by applying the air temperature data obtained from 2000 to 2018 are illustrated in fig 1 the annual maximum of level ice thickness from the calculation of the air temperature by using freezing degree day with zubov model is validated by comparison with weekly in situ measurements of the ice thickness by drillings throughout the winter from the kemi station ronkainen et al 2018 which is located close to the rödkallen station the corresponding results are given in fig 3 fig 2 shows the annual maximum level ice thickness for 66 years the mean value and standard deviation of the thickness for the entire data series are equal to 0 66 and 0 17 m respectively various probabilistic models are fitted to the level ice thickness data e g the normal the lognormal the gamma the gumbel and the weibull distributions it was found that the normal distribution provides the most appropriate fitting for the level ice thickness as illustrated in fig 4 both the chi square and kolmogorov tests are applied in order to verify the applicability of this distribution at an adequate significance level 2 2 ice flexural strength typically sea ice fails in a flexural mode when it interacts with sloping structures this implies that the flexural strength of sea ice becomes a very important parameter for calculation of the ice loading this applies in particular to the case of thin ice and slender structures the texture of sea ice is dominated by a random alternation between layers with different properties this inhomogeneous feature of the physical characteristics of sea ice has a significant effect on the stochastic nature of the flexural strength flexural testing of sea ice can generally be carried out by three different methods according to the antarctic research institute aari recommendations these are the cantilever beam tests three points beam tests and small ice plate tests among these tests the cantilever beam test is the most reliable method because this test is conducted in situ which allows an assessment of sea ice flexural strength over the whole thickness relocation of the sample is also avoided disturbance due to relocation can easily generate inaccuracies associated with the test data the data set corresponding to flexural strength of sea ice in this study is obtained from timco and o brien 1994 it is collected during different winter seasons based on different test types temperature size of the beam etc both in the field and in the laboratory data for the flexural strength of sea ice as a function of the root brine volume taken from timco and o brien 1994 is shown in fig 5 the mean value and standard deviation of the sampled data for the flexural strength are equal to 0 479 and 0 264 mpa respectively different types of probabilistic models have been applied as candidates in order to fit the probability distribution of the flexural strength it is found that the weibull distribution given by eq 3 provides the most appropriate fit for the present data set the result of the fitting is shown in fig 6 and the scale parameter and shape parameter of the weibull distribution are determined as 0 5385 and 1 9655 based on regressions coefficients for the straight line fitted in the corresponding probability paper 3 f σ f β α σ f α β 1 exp σ f α β 2 3 ice strength coefficient cr the new formulation of the ice crushing load on the vertical structures with the iso 19906 standard was developed from the full scale measurement at the structures ice strength coefficients c r is introduced as a key parameter in order to estimates ice loading by including the effects of ice crushing strength temperature salinity etc into one coefficient paquette and brown 2017 the value of ice strength coefficient c r is depended on the ice properties which vary corresponding to the climate of the geographical area for deterministic analysis the iso standard offers the c r value for alternatives in specific region the extreme level ice event elie is recommended for the ultimate limit state uls design to ensure that no significant structural damage occurs for both global and local action with an acceptable low probability entire the service life of the structures the c r value is originally estimated from the extreme value prediction kärnä and masterson 2011 with 100 year return period in each specific region with 2 8 mpa for arctic area and 1 8 mpa for a temperature area iso 2010 this present research use the data of the measured local pressure on lighthouse in baltic sea to perform the probabilistic assessment the data of the strength coefficient c r is estimated from the maximum peak value of the panel pressures which were measured at the norströmsgrund lighthouse from 2000 to 2003 by kärnä and masterson 2011 and kärnä and yan 2006 the values of ice strength coefficient c r are estimated from the backward calculation of the measured ice pressure corresponding to the iso formulation the data of ice strength coefficients c r with the ice thickness are illustrated in fig 8 various probabilistic models are fitted to this data it was found that the weibull distribution provides the most appropriate fitting as illustrated in fig 7 the regression coefficients of the straight line fitting in the corresponding probability paper are applied these estimators correspond to shape and scale parameter of 4 5044 and 0 4456 respectively the formula for the probability density function of the weibull distribution is given in equation 4 which is of the same type as in equation 3 4 f c r β α c r α β 1 exp c r α β 2 4 correlation between the physical properties of sea ice from experiments for design of offshore structures with respect to ice loading the sea ice properties are employed as primary input parameters in order to estimate the ice loading for a given structural configuration the magnitudes of the ice loads on the structure are typically strongly dependent on the type of sea ice failure mechanism there are typically also important effects of the correlation between the ice parameters and the resulting load magnitude estimation of these correlation coefficients based on and consideration of underlying physical mechanisms were studied by leira et al 2019 available datasets giving the relationship between the ice properties and the underlying basic variables e g the air temperature can be utilized for the purposed of quantifying the correlation coefficients between these properties for vertical structures the ice thickness and ice strength coefficient are employed as the key parameters in order to estimate the design ice loading based on iso 2010 correlation between the ice thickness and the ice strength coefficient was estimated based on data obtained from load panels attached to the norströmsgrund lighthouse in the baltic sea the width of the lighthouse at the level of the load panel instruments which are located at the cold water line cwl is 7 5m the data points were determined based on ice crushing events corresponding to peak pressures during stationary brittle crushing failure kärnä and masterson 2011 the degree of correlation between the ice thickness and the ice strength coefficient for different winter seasons during the period from 2000 to 2003 is estimated based on the measurements which correspond to the points shown in fig 8 it is found that the values of correlation coefficients vary between the different winter seasons in the range from 0 41 to 0 41 for sloping structures the ice thickness and the flexural strength are in some cases key parameters for estimation of the ice loading i e for relatively thin ice narrow structures and no snow this is due to the dominant ice failure mechanism for these cases being the flexural failure mode in general the flexural ice strength can be obtain from field experiments however field experiments carried out in cold regions have to deal with many kinds of difficulties such as limited budget time consuming operations and hard working condition etc in particularly performing flexural testing is very time consuming which implies that only a few tests can be carried out within a day period therefore the amount of field experimental data related to flexural strength of sea ice is quite limited for the present research data of flexural testing from different locations are selected in order to estimate the correlation between the ice thickness and the flexural strength estimation of flexural strength was carried out by means of cantilever beam tests the first and second data sets were digitized from langhorne and haskell 2004 who performed flexural testing by means of sea ice cantilever beams and by refreezing cracks of sea ice cantilever beams for the third and fourth data sets the flexural testing was conducted around the svalbard archipelago i e in svea bay and lance respectively in order to estimate sea ice properties in the north west barents sea ervik 2013 all experimental data for the flexural testing with different values of the ice thickness are illustrated in fig 9 the values of the correlation coefficient vary between the different data sets within the range from 0 32 to 0 76 the first data set represents conditions with thick level ice the thickness of the ice specimens varies from 1 79 m to 1 93 m the air temperature at the ice surface during the experiments was between 15 c and 21 c the correlation coefficient between the ice thickness and flexural strength for this data set has a negative value of 0 310 for second data set the specimens were refrozen from the first data set in order to perform flexural tests for the same weather condition the ice thickness of the refrozen specimens at the crack varied from 0 15m to 1 47m although the ice thickness of refrozen beams of the second data set is somewhat smaller than for the first data set the values of the correlation coefficient is 0 322 which is only slightly different from that for the first one more detailed information in relation to temperature and brine fraction profiles along the level ice thickness are given in langhorne and haskell 2004 for the third data set the flexural tests of sea ice were performed with six specimens of cantilever beams these had different lengths and widths with lengths in the interval 1 5 3 0m and widths in the interval 0 45 0 6m for the fourth data set the flexural tests of the cantilever beam specimens were performed with lengths of 7m 3 specimens 1 5m 1 specimens and 0 7m 2 specimens respectively during the experiments which were conducted in the north west barents sea air temperatures at the ice surface varied from about 9 c to 14 c ervik 2013 the flexural strength of the sea ice tends to increase with the ice thickness for the present data set the correlation coefficients for the third and fourth data sets are 0 764 and 0 566 respectively merging all the four data sets into one the estimated value of correlation coefficient between the ice thickness and ice flexural strength is found to be 0 660 3 theoretical background 3 1 probabilistic assessment the probabilistic assessment procedure in relation to ice structure interaction starts with exploration of the primary ice data associated with the specific site area under consideration i e data corresponding to ice thickness ice strength coefficient and flexural strength probabilistic models are fitted to the primary ice data in the present study the lowest to the highest values of the correlation coefficients are applied in conjunction with the nataf model more extensive samples of the random variables are generated for the key parameters by application of mcs techniques a flowchart illustrating the steps of the probabilistic assessment for ice loading is shown in fig 10 3 1 1 monte carlo simulation monte carlo simulation msc is used to carry out the probabilistic assessment of the loading due to ice structure interaction in the cases of vertical structures the samples correspond to different values of the ice thickness and the ice strength coefficient in order to investigate the uncertainty associated with the horizontal ice pressure and global ice loads in the case of sloping structures values of the flexural strength of sea ice are generated instead of the ice strength coefficient the sample values of the level ice thickness x i the flexural strength x j and the ice strength coefficient x k are generated from the inverted cdf of the normal distribution the weibull distribution and the weibull distribution respectively the sample values are generated based on random numbers drawn from a uniform distribution denoted by x u the corresponding sample values are given by equations 5

coefficient x k f c r u s h i n g 1 x u the effects of introducing correlation between the key parameters are also investigated in this work for vertical structures these parameters are the ice thickness and ice strength coefficient while for sloping structures these are the ice thickness and the flexural strength independence between the basic variables corresponds to the correlation coefficient ρ being equals to 0 which is first applied as input to the mcs the scatter diagram with independent ice thickness and flexural strength for sloping structures is shown in the left part of fig 11 in the right part the corresponding scatter diagram for independent ice thickness and ice strength coefficient for vertical structures is shown subsequently the effect of introducing correlation between the variables is studied by application of the nataf transformation model 3 1 2 nataf transformation model typically there will exist correlation between the parameters which characterize the physical properties of sea ice this correlation can be estimated based on experimental data the nataf transformation model is able to represent this correlation structure in order to generate the corresponding joint probability density and distribution functions liu and der kiureghian 1986 the basic assumption behind the nataf transformation model is that the basic random variables representing the physical properties of sea ice can be obtained by transformation of corresponding gaussian variables z i z j z k and vice versa as given by equations 8 10 8 z i φ 1 f t h i c k n e s s x i 9 z j φ 1 f f l e x u r a l x j 10 z k φ 1 f c r u s h i n g x j the correlation coefficient ρ 0 i j between the two gaussian variables z i and z j is related to the correlation coefficient ρ i j between the thickness x i and flexural strength of sea ice x j the correlation between the random variables representing the physical parameters i e x i and x j is expressed as 11 ρ i j x i μ i σ i x j μ j σ j ϕ 2 z i z j ρ 0 i j d z i d z j where e x r μ r v a r x r σ r 2 r i j or r i k and ϕ 2 is the bivariate standard normal probability density function as given by equation 12 12 ϕ 2 z i z j ρ 0 i j 1 2 π 1 ρ 0 i j 2 exp z i 2 z j 2 2 ρ 0 i j z i z j 2 1 ρ 0 i j 2 in the gaussian plane the uncorrelated variables z i z j can be transformed to correlated variables z ˆ 1 and z ˆ 2 as expressed by equation 13 13 z ˆ i z ˆ j 1 0 ρ 1 ρ 2 z i z j for vertical structures the parameter x k representing the ice strength coefficients in equations 10 and 12 will be applied instead of the flexural strength of sea ice i e x j the nataf transformation model is valid for the entire range of the correlation coefficient i e between 1 and 1 in the present study the effect of the correlation between the key parameters of the ice loading acting on vertical and sloping structures is considered five values of the correlation coefficient ρ are applied and these are equal to 0 9 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 9 these cover the relevant range from the smallest to the highest values the upper and lower values for the correlation coefficient are set as 0 9 and 0 9 due to numerical limitations associated with the transformation i e the transformation matrix in eq 13 becomes singular in the limit as the absolute value of the correlation coefficient approaches 1 0 the corresponding scatter diagrams based on application of the nataf transformation model for different values of the correlation coefficient to perform the uncertain assessment of ice loading on vertical and sloping structures are demonstrated in figs 12 and 13 respectively 3 2 ice interaction with structures 3 2 1 ice load on vertical structures for vertical structures the mechanism of ice failure typically corresponds to the crushing mode the formulation of the ice pressure p g based on the iso 19906 standard is given in equation 14 14 p g c r h h 1 n w h m where c r is the ice strength coefficient h is the ice thickness h 1 is a reference thickness of 1 m w is the width of the structure m is an empirical coefficient equal to 0 16 n is an empirical coefficient equal to 0 5 h 5 for h 1 0 m and equal to 0 30 for h 1 0 m iso 2010 for ice crushing against a vertical structure the global ice load f g occurs perpendicular to the contact surface according to the limit mechanism of ice failure and is expressed in terms of equation 15 15 f g p g h w in the present study different structural widths are considered i e 1 m 4m and 10m this is in order to investigate the resulting influence of the width on the computed ice pressure and the global ice force in connection with the probabilistic assessment based on application of monte carlo simulation 3 2 2 ice load on sloping structures in the present study focus is on ice loading calculated according to the formula suggested by the iso 19906 standard which is based on the theory of beam bending on an elastic foundation croasdale and cammaert 1994 iso 2010 inclined slope configurations can be divided into two main categories which correspond to upward and downward slopes as illustrated in figs 14 and 15 respectively in the case of downward sloping structures the weight of the ice fragments or ice rubbles due to fracture of ice sheet will be considered as a submerged weight which takes into account the effect of buoyancy the major components of the global ice loads can be decomposed into the horizontal and vertical directions these components are functions of normal component n of ice action on the structure the sloping angle α and the friction coefficient μ s t of the surface roughness between sea ice and the structure the formula of horizontal ice force f h and vertical ice force f v can be expressed by equations 16 and 17 16 f h n sin α μ s t n cos α 17 f v n cos α μ s t n sin α the loading ratio ξ calculated from the horizontal and vertical ice load components is expressed by equation 18 18 ξ f h f v sin α μ cos α cos α μ sin α in the iso 19906 standard the horizontal global ice load is subdivided into five components according to the interaction mechanism these are as follows the breaking load h b the load component required to push the sheet ice through the ice rubble h p the load required in order to push the ice blocks up the slope through the ice rubble h r the load required to lift the ice rubble on top of the advancing ice sheet prior to breaking it h l and the load needed to turn the ice block at the top of the slope h t this formulation is expressed by means of equation 19 19 f h h b h p h r h l h t 1 h b σ f l c h where l c is the total length of the circumferential crack the breaking load component h b is the major loading which corresponds to bending of ice sheet which invokes the flexural strength σ f of the sea ice and results in the following expression 20 h b 0 68 ξ σ f ρ w g h 5 e 0 25 w π 2 l c 4 where ρ w is the density of seawater g is gravitational acceleration w is the width of the structure during the ice structure interaction the length of the ice sheet between the interaction domain and the location of the fracture position is referred to as the critical length l c the theoretical formulation for the critical length is based on elastic plate bending as given by equation 21 21 l c e h 3 12 ρ w g 1 υ 2 1 4 where e and υ is the elastic modulus and the poisson ratio respectively in order to push the advancing ice sheet through the ice rubble the load component h p arises which is given as 22 h p w h r 2 μ i ρ i g 1 e 1 tan θ tan α 2 1 2 tan θ where h r is the rubble height μ i is the friction coefficient of ice to ice rubble ρ i is the density of the sea ice e is the porosity of the ice rubble θ is the angle the rubble makes with the horizontal plane the additional force required in order to push the ice blocks up the slope through the ice rubble is the load component h r as given by equation 23 23 h r w p 1 cos α μ s t sin α the parameter p is expressed by equation 24 24 p 0 5 μ i μ i μ s t ρ i g 1 e h r 2 sin α 1 tan θ 1 tan α 1 tan θ tan α 0 5 μ i μ s t ρ i g 1 e h r 2 cos α tan α 1 tan θ tan α h r h ρ i g sin α μ s t cos α sin α the load component h l is given in equation 25 25 h l 0 5 w h r 2 ρ i g 1 e ξ 1 tan θ 1 tan α 1 tan θ tan α 0 5 w h r 2 ρ i g 1 e ξ tan φ 1 tan θ tan α 2 ξ c w h r 1 tan θ tan α where c is the cohesion of the ice rubble and φ is the corresponding friction angle the load component h t is due to turning of the ice block at the top of the slope as given by equation 26 26 h t 1 5 w h 2 ρ i g cos α sin α μ s t cos α during the interaction between the ice and the sloping structure the extent of ride up of the rubble pile is significantly enlarged due to accumulation of ice fragments empirical formulas obtained from data collected at the kemi i lighthouse and the confederation bridge are applied in order to calculate the rubble pile height brown and määttänen 2009 the heights of ice ride up or rubble pile up are related to the water level or the level ice surface for the kemi i lighthouse the rubble pile up height increases linearly as illustrated in equation 27 for the confederation bridge the rubble pile up increases according to a power law function as given in equation 28 27 h r 3 4 h 28 h r 7 64 h 0 64 the relationship between rubble pile up height versus level ice thickness are illustrated in fig 16 the rubble pile up height is a function of the level ice thickness the pdf of the rubble pile up height can be calculated by using a one to one transformation for the monotonously increasing function which is given in equation 29 two different rubble pile up height pdfs are plotted in fig 16 for two different cases i e the kemi i light house and the confederation bridge in this analysis the confederation bridge formula is applied to calculate the rubble pile up height because it provides higher value from the estimation which can be observed from the pdfs in fig 16 therefore more conservative global forces would be estimated 29 f h r h r f h i h g 1 h r d h d h r where g is the functional relationship of rubble pile up height in the relevant area of level ice thickness as illustrated in fig 17 the sea ice will get in contact with the surface area of the structures during the interaction the friction coefficient is therefore important to estimate the global ice loading the value of the friction coefficient between the sea ice and the structure saeki et al 1986 depends on the temperature contact speed and surface roughness the value of the friction coefficient for the present analysis is based on the average value of ice drift speed in the barents sea as given in table 1 the input parameters for investigation of the uncertainty associate with the global ice load on sloping structures i e upwards or downwards based on formulation of iso 19906 2010 are presented in table 1 in addition the analysis considers ice breaking in both the upward and downward directions each slope category is divided into three different angles as listed in table 2 4 results according to the ice loads on structures obtained by application of the iso standard the analysis of ice load is different for vertical versus sloping structures basically this is due to the sea ice failure mechanisms being different for the two cases which correspond to the crushing mode and the flexural mode respectively 4 1 vertical structures in the first part below results for the average ice pressure and the global ice loads on vertical structures are presented the ice pressure is found to be a decrease function when the structural width and ice thickness increase due to the scaling effect interestingly the values of the ice pressure increase dramatically when the ice thickness is lower than 0 25 m as illustrated in figs 18 and 19 a this is because of the power term of aspect ratio from iso formulation in equation 14 furthermore the global ice forces on the vertical structures demonstrates an increasing function with the ice thickness the width of the structure and the ice strength coefficient as illustrated in fig 19 b the results imply that the range of thin ice thickness provides the higher ice pressure on the local members of the structures which may leads to higher local member stresses moreover the average ice pressure of iso formulation does not take into account the effect of the imperfection of the contract area in the high pressure zone or critical zone which can promote the higher local ice pressure due to the confinement during of the ice structure interactions process nevertheless jordaan 2001 found that the high pressure zone of the contact area in case of thin ice is not significant for local ice pressure as part of the probabilistic assessment the effects of correlation between the ice thickness and the ice strength coefficient in connection with ice pressures and global ice forces based on the nataf transformation model are investigated numerical samples based on the nataf transformation model for a correlation coefficient equal to 0 5 in the planes of average ice pressure and global ice force are shown in fig 20 it can be seen that some data points from the numerical samples are located in the region where scale effects are important higher negative values of the correlation coefficients between the ice thickness and the ice strength coefficient tend to generate more sample data points in the region where scale effects are of significance however those sample points do not correspond to high values of the global ice force the statistical parameters based on the mcs results for vertical structures are given in table 3 in terms of mean value standard deviation and coefficient of variation cov of the ice pressure per square metre and global ice load the cov indicates the degree of dispersion of the probability distribution of the ice loads slender structures i e with small width tend to exhibit higher mean values of the ice pressure per square metre than wider structures owing to the scale effect of sea ice the lower correlation between ice thickness and ice strength coefficient demonstrates higher uncertainty for average ice pressures which can be observed from the higher values of cov and standard deviation on the contrary the uncertainty in the global ice forces demonstrates the opposite trends which values of standard and covs increase according to the effect of correlation between ice thickness and ice strength coefficient the results of the ice pressure and global ice loading are presented in the box and whisker diagram to illustrate the data distribution in the connection with the interquartile range iqr the iqr is defined from the 25th percentile q1 and the 75th percentile q3 as iqr q3 q1 the middle line inside each of the rectangular boxes demonstrates the median and whiskers above and below the box demonstrates the location of the minimum and maximum of 1 5 iqr lower values of the correlation coefficient between the ice thickness and the ice strength coefficient for average ice pressure implies a high level of dispersion which also means that a larger number of data points will exceed the maximum whisker limits as illustrated in fig 21 on the contrary the results for the global ice forces exhibit an opposite trend as illustrated in fig 22 for each box and whisker diagram of the ice pressure and the ice force the central mark indicates the median and the bottom and top edges of the box indicate q1 25th percentiles and q3 75th percentiles respectively the bottom and top whiskers limits indicate q1 1 5 iqr and q3 1 5 iqr respectively https ch mathworks com help stats boxplot html the samples obtained based on the monte carlo simulation are applied for the purpose of distribution fitting this allows us to investigate the statistical characteristic of the global ice loads for vertical structures an example of a quality plot for fitting the average ice pressure and global ice forces acting on vertical structure for a correlation coefficient ρ 0 5 and a width of 1 00 m by application of the weibull distribution is illustrated in fig 23 the correlation coefficient has a significant effect on the shape of the probability density function of the average ice pressure and global ice forces the flat shape of pdf implies the higher dispersion or uncertainty which contains inside the random variables the average ice pressure trends to have flatter shape when the value of correlation coefficients between ice thickness and ice strength coefficient decrease whereas the opposite trend between the average ice pressure and global ice forces also addresses on the pdfs the weibull probability density functions pdf of ice pressures and global ice loading are displayed in fig 24 the effect of varying correlation on the average ice pressure can also be studied by comparison of the respective cumulative density functions cdf for different values of the correlation coefficients these are shown the same trends with pdfs as illustrated in fig 25 in which the effect of structural width is also illustrated 4 2 sloping structures for sloping structures the global ice loads from the iso formulation increase significantly with increasingly steeper slopes in both the upward and downward slope directions the magnitude for the global ice loads in the horizontal direction are higher than those in the vertical direction and the values of ice load in the horizontal direction is more sensitive to the sloping angles than vertical direction which can be observed in fig 26 for monte carlo simulation the samples of vertical and horizontal ice loads are generated from the basic variables of ice thickness and flexural strength based on the iso formulation after that the application of nataf transformation model is applied to simulate the dependency between the basic variables corresponding to the correlation coefficient ρ the examples of scatter diagrams for horizontal and vertical loads with dependent correlation coefficient between ice thickness and flexural strength for upward and downward slopes directions are shown in figs 27 and 28 respectively the statistical parameters of the horizontal and vertical ice loads on sloping structures in upward and downward direction given in terms of mean values standard deviations covs and kurtosis are listed in tables 4 and 5 respectively the results for the ice loads on sloping structure can be indicated the level of uncertainties by using statistical parameter with coefficient of variation cov for global horizontal ice load steeper slope geometries provide higher loading magnitudes and higher uncertainties the values of the cov are increasing with steeper slopes and higher value of correlation coefficients between ice thickness and flexural strength the breaking load component h b is the major loading which corresponds to the bending of the ice sheet to invoke the flexural failure of the sea ice the global vertical ice loads on the sloping structures are also demonstrated the same pattern with the horizontal ice loads however the mean values of ice loading do not change so much with varying sloping angles higher correlation between the ice thickness and flexural strength leads to higher dispersion of pdfs which corresponds to higher statistical uncertainty the value of the cov demonstrates an increasing function of the correlation coefficient for both upward and downward sloping structures the results of horizontal and vertical ice forces on the sloping structure are demonstrated in the box and whisker diagram to present the data in the interquartile range iqr for horizontal ice force the higher correlation coefficients between ice thickness and flexural strength provide higher uncertainty which can be observed from the longer length of box spans and whisker length as illustrated in fig 29 whereas the vertical ice forces present almost the same trend of data distributions with horizontal ice forces when changing slop angles the uncertainty related to vertical ice forces are mainly dependent on the correlation coefficients between ice thickness and flexural strength however the median of the vertical ice force does not vary much in comparison with the horizontal ice forces as shown in fig 30 for each box and whisker diagram for the horizontal and the vertical ice forces the central mark indicates the median and the bottom and top edges of the box indicate q1 25th percentiles and q3 75th percentiles respectively the bottom and top whisker limits indicate q1 1 5 iqr and q3 1 5 iqr respectively various types of probabilistic models have been applied as the candidates to fit the distributive results of horizontal and vertical ice forces as a result the weibull distribution provide the most appropriate fit for the component of global ice force on the sloping structures the example of the pdf fitting with horizontal and vertical ice force by the weibull distribution is illustrated in fig 31 flatter slopes provide significantly reduction for the loading magnitude in horizontal direction owning to the transformation of failure mechanism of sea ice from crushing mode to bending mode the uncertainty of global ice loads on sloping structure in upward and downward directions can also be observed in the pdfs as shown in figs 30 and 31 respectively the correlation coefficients between the ice thickness and flexural strength of sea ice demonstrate a significant effect to the shapes of pdf for the global ice loading the shapes of pdfs are flatter when the values of correlation coefficient in both upward and downward directions increase for the slope angle the results of uncertainty assessment present the significant effects only in the horizontal direction of ice loading the steeper slopes provide the higher dispersion and higher uncertainty in the global horizontal ice forces as shown in fig 32 however the slope effect is not obviously presented in the vertical ice forces which can be seen in the shape of pdfs as illustrated in fig 33 furthermore the results of uncertainty assessment for sloping structures can be summarized in cdfs as illustrated in fig 34 5 discussion intrinsically sea ice properties are associated with a high uncertainty level due to the corresponding large differences between the maximum and minimum values of the parameters which enter the expressions for calculation of the ice loading the effect of correlation between the parameters can be expected to be significant i e high high high low or low low combinations this effect is considered in the present study furthermore based on different experimental data sets obtained from field measurements figs 8 and 9 we found that there exists a certain degree of correlation between key design parameters for both vertical and sloping structures based on a probabilistic analysis the effect of correlation between sea ice properties on the computed ice loads can be readily taken into account this is achieved by utilization of multivariate probability density functions which include the relevant correlation coefficients as explicit parameters in combination with monte carlo simulation techniques the corresponding effect on the resulting ice load magnitude which is calculated based on the formulation in the widely applied iso standard can then be quantified for the analysis correlation coefficient values in the entire range from the lowest to highest values are considered i e between 1 and 1 for computational purposes the correlation coefficient is assigned values in the range from 0 9 to 0 9 in order to avoid numerical problems the degree of uncertainty associated with the ice loads is quantified in terms of the coefficient of variation i e the cov high values of the cov imply high levels of uncertainty moreover the levels of uncertainty can also be observed based on the shape of the pdfs and cdfs i e flatter shape of the pdfs and a smaller slope of the cdfs imply higher levels of uncertainty characteristic values of the ice loads to be applied for design purposes can be determined by means of upper fractiles of the corresponding probability distributions ditlevsen and madsen 1996 increasing uncertainty levels imply that the ratio of a given fractile to the mean value will increase accordingly for design purpose the characteristic values of the loads i e the fractile values are subsequently multiplied partial load coefficients in order to ensure an adequate level of structural reliability ditlevsen and madsen 1996 typically characteristic design values for external loads are taken to be the 95 fractile or above in the present study the 99 fractile is utilized in order to demonstrate the influence from the degree of correlation between key design parameters on the resulting ice loading for both vertical and sloping structures 5 1 vertical structures for calculation of ice loads acting on vertical structures based on the iso standard the ice thickness and ice strength coefficient are key parameters for estimation of the ice pressure and the global ice forces the correlation coefficients between these quantities can be estimated based on measurements of loads acting on panels which are attached to the structures values of the observed correlation between the ice thickness and the ice strength coefficient from four experiments are 0 574 0 408 0 014 and 0 413 respectively the observed values of the correlation coefficient tends to be in the negative side which can also be observed from fig 8 in section 2 4 it is found that the effects of changing the correlation coefficient between ice thickness and ice strength coefficient exhibit opposite trends for the ice pressure versus the global ice force this is clearly observed from the pdfs and cdfs of the ice pressure and global ice force in figs 24 and 25 the relevant statistical parameters for calculation of the 99 fractiles of the ice pressure and global ice force are listed in table 3 the effect of varying the correlation coefficient on this fractile for the ice pressure and global ice load is shown in figs 35 and 36 respectively as seen from fig 35a negative values of the correlation coefficient imply higher values of the 99 fractile for the ice pressure on the contrary fig 36a shows that positive values of correlation coefficient provides higher values of 99 fractile for the global ice force this can be further demonstrated by normalizing the 99 fractiles with the value corresponding to zero correlation as can be seen from fig 35b there is a 30 decrease of the ice pressure by going from a value of the correlation coefficient of 0 0 9 for the global horizontal force there is instead and increase of 40 for the same case as seen from fig 36b respectively 5 2 sloping structures for sloping structures the level ice thickness rubble pile up height and the flexural strength are in some cases important parameters to estimate the ice loading e g for thin ice narrow structures and no snow in this analysis the distributions of accumulated rubble pile up height according to the empirical formulas from data collected at the kemi lighthouse and at the confederation bridge were estimated based on the probability density functions of level ice thickness by using a one to one transformation corresponding to a monotonously increasing function it found that the results for the confederation bridge provide the highest values which can be observed from the pdf of the rubble pile up height in fig 16 therefore the results for the confederation bridge are employed in the computation in order to obtain more conservative global forces subsequently the two parameters corresponding to thickness of the level ice and ice flexural strength represent the key parameters in order to estimate the ice loading on sloping structures in the present study the effects of varying correlation between level ice thickness and ice flexural strength is considered the correlation coefficient between these quantities was estimated based on data obtained from field measurements at different locations and with different weather conditions the results of these measurements are illustrated by means of joint sets of data points in fig 9 in section 2 4 the values of correlation coefficient which was estimated from each of the data sets are found to be 0 310 0 322 0 764 and 0 566 respectively merging all the data sets the correlation coefficients was estimated as 0 66 the effects of varying the correlation coefficient on the resulting pdfs and cdfs are illustrated by the results in figs 32 34 the corresponding values of the cov are listed in tables 4 and 5 the variation of the value of the 99 fractile resulting from variation of the correlation coefficient is shown in fig 37 a horizontal force and 38b vertical force for different values of the sloping angle the corresponding results obtained by normalizing the 99 fractile of the global horizontal and vertical forces with the values corresponding to zero correlation are shown in figs 37b and 38 b it is seen that there is an increase of about 60 when going from a correlation coefficient of zero to 0 9 for both the horizontal and the vertical load components the action factors and action combination factors for iso 19906 2010 to be applied for the ultimate limit state uls and the abnormal limit state als in relation to environmental actions including ice loads are about 1 35 and 1 10 for respectively the highest and the intermediate exposure levels in the present study the effects of correlation between key design parameters with respect to the calculated ice loads are quantified by comparison with the case of zero correlation the normalized values of the global ice loads increase approximately 40 and 60 for a correlation coefficient of 0 9 as compared to the case with zero correlation for the case of vertical and sloping structures respectively however the correlation between the relevant design parameters will usually have a value between 0 and 0 9 and it can also be negative therefore more extensive studies of the proper correlation to be applied for calculation of design ice loads than those reported in the literature should be performed this could result in load parameter combination factors to be applied for selection of joint parameter values to be applied for design purposes 6 conclusions a probabilistic assessment of loads due to ice structure interaction based on the formula in the iso standard has been performed by means of monte carlo simulation techniques two types of structures are analysed i e with vertical and sloping configurations respectively the correlation coefficient between the ice strength coefficient and the ice thickness as well as the correlation coefficient between the flexural strength and the ice thickness were estimated and the corresponding effects on the uncertainties associated with the ice loads were investigated for varying values of the correlation coefficients the degree of uncertainty associated with the ice loads was quantified in terms of cov values i e higher values of the cov imply higher levels of uncertainty for practical design the fractile values are usually employed in combination with the partial load factors in order to ensure adequate structural reliability levels our analysis shows that both the global ice force and its associated uncertainty increased for high values of the correlation coefficients as compared to the case with zero correlation for vertical structures the mean values the standard deviations the covs and the 99 fractile of the global forces increased by approximately 10 40 30 and 40 respectively when going from a correlation coefficient of 0 0 9 for sloping structures the mean value the standard deviation the cov and the 99 fractile of the global horizontal and vertical forces increase by approximately 20 60 35 and 60 respectively when going from a correlation coefficient of 0 0 9 for sloping structures higher values of the sloping angles imply higher values of the standard deviation this applies accordingly also to the cov and the fractile values associated with the global forces changing the slope angle will have a stronger influence on the mean values the standard deviations the covs and the fractile values for the global forces in the horizontal direction as compared to the global forces in the vertical direction quantification of the uncertainty associated with the environmental ice loading on offshore structures is required in order to enhance the accuracy associated with choice of partial load factors for structural design purposes this applies to the limit state design this also implies an increase of the reliability level of the structures during their operation due to more accurate information accordingly the types of probability density functions and the values of the relevant correlation coefficients for a proper statistical characterization of sea ice loading should be selected with care this is in order to perform a precise assessment of the structural reliability level associated

22086,sea ice is the major source of loading for structural design in cold regions the intrinsic properties of sea ice are generally associated with high degrees of uncertainty due to ice growth taking place during different environmental conditions for different areas the thickness ice strength coefficient and flexural strength of sea ice are the parameters for the calculation of ice loads the aim of the present paper is to investigate the uncertainties associated with the ice loads which are acting on vertical and sloping structures as calculated by the formulations in the iso 19906 standard the effect of correlation between the key parameters is investigated by using the nataf transformation model monte carlo simulation techniques are applied in order to assess the uncertainties associated with the global ice loads due to ice structure interaction it is found that for increasing values of the positive correlation between the sea ice properties the uncertainties of the global ice forces will increase the fractile for both vertical and sloping structures approximately up to 40 and 60 from the case with zero correlation moreover for sloping structures higher values of the sloping angles imply increasing levels of uncertainty associated with the ice loads keywords ice loads ice structure interaction probabilistic analysis iso standard 1 introduction the inherent mechanism of ice structure interaction is a complex phenomenon owing to the sea ice properties and interaction process structures in the arctic and subarctic regions are generally subjected to drifting ice during their time in operation especially during the winter season the magnitude of ice loads is typically related to the failure mechanisms of sea ice itself different structural configurations imply different failure modes of the sea ice which are associated with relevant types of ice breaking process a variety of vertical and sloping structures are typically employed in connection with structural applications such as ships barges gravity base structures gbs legs lighthouses etc considering this variety the characteristics of the sea ice properties are inherently associated with large uncertainties this implies that representation of the ice properties and load coefficients as random variables in order to establish a credible probabilistic models is essential based on such probabilistic models structural reliability analysis procedures can be applied in order to quantify the level of safety and integrity of structures in these regions bekker et al 2011b during ice structure interaction two different and distinct failure mechanisms are observed which correspond to the flexural versus the crushing failure mode for vertical structures the crushing mode is dominating the picture due to confinement of the ice during interaction however the loading is significantly reduced when the structural geometry is changed from a vertical to a sloping configuration this is due to a transition from a crushing to the bending failure mode accordingly this feature can be utilized when performing design of arctic and subarctic structures in order to obtain more economic structures bruun and gudmestad 2006 inherently sea ice properties depend on the ice growth conditions related to the climate in a given region sea ice samples are typically collected from the target area in order to estimate the sea ice properties by means of field and laboratory tests the intrinsic properties of sea ice are associated with uncertainties according to the ice features and the ice conditions e g temperature salinity density porosity grain size and orientation strub klein 2017 the design of arctic and subarctic offshore structures to withstand the ice loading requires that physical as well as mechanical data of sea ice are available which can be collected separately for physical property of sea ice the ice draft or ice thickness is the main factor which dominates the ice loading for both vertical and sloping structures it can be measured by different methods such as satellites submarines upward looking sonar uls helicopter borne electromagnetic instruments hem etc different measurement methods provide different accuracy according to the properties of each instrument for instance satellites measurements of sea ice can cover a large area but the accuracy is not the best the hem can give information about the sea ice thickness only along the flying track of the helicopter the precision of the hem method for ice thickness measurement depends on instrumental noise and flying height pfaffling et al 2007 furthermore the average daily air temperature from the local measurement stations can be applied with the ice growth model to estimate the level ice thickness in the vicinity area li et al 2016 on the other hand the mechanical properties of sea ice such as flexural strength uniaxial strength ice strength coefficient can only be obtained from experiments or measurements in the field or in the laboratory for vertical structures zvyagin 2015 introduced an analytical method for the purpose of probabilistic modelling in relation to ice pressure for vertical structures according to the formulation in the iso standard iso 2010 the thickness and strength coefficient of sea ice were considered as random variables based on the application of a lognormal distribution for both parameters for the purpose of investigating the uncertainty associated with the calculated ice pressure for sloping structure a similar analysis can be performed based on identification of the most important parameters that enter the calculations it is found that the flexural strength ice thickness accumulation of ice rubble and friction coefficients between the sea ice and structures are the dominant quantities for the loading on sloping structures ranta et al 2018 studied the failure of level ice pushing against inclined structures by performing finite discrete element analyses in order to identify the ice failure processes by deterministic and probabilistic methods the results showed that the ice thickness has a strong effect on the resulting ice load in the case of deterministic analysis the initial condition of incoming ice velocity for the simulation model has a significant influence on the ice load estimation in the probabilistic analysis it was found that the sample size of the simulated ice data has a significant effect on the accuracy of ice load estimation the sample size of ice load data for the numerical simulations is relevant for calculation of mean ice load standard deviation and maximum load as obtained from the time domain simulation ayubian et al 2016 performed a probabilistic assessment of the ice loading on vertical structures by application of monte carlo simulation the ice thickness and ice strength coefficients of sea ice were treated as the key parameters and were represented by random variables when calculation the exceedance probability for different levels of the ice load when performing structural reliability analysis it is important to represent the correlation between the sea ice properties in a proper way due to the strong influence on the resulting loading there are several existing national and international standards for determination of the ice loads on offshore structures such as the american api rp 2n 1995 the canadian csa s471 04 2004 the chinese code q hsn 30002002 2002 the iso standard iso 19906 the russian snip code 2 06 04 82 1995 and the russian vsn code 41 88 1988 thijssen et al 2014 frederking 2012 studied the ice pressure on vertical structures resulting from application of different standards i e api csa iso and snip the study was performed based on a deterministic analysis for three different types of structures i e with slender intermediate and wide loading surfaces as a result he recommended that the canadian csa s6 06 canadian highway bridge design code is suitable for slender and intermediate structures and the canadian csa s471 04 is suitable for wide structures for existing offshore structures bekker et al 2011a studied the global ice loads acting on structures in the okhotsk sea for oil and gas fields such as orlan sakhalin i piltun astohsky a b molikpaq lunsky a and sakhlin ii comparison was made between different national and international design guidelines and codes as a result ice loads based on the snip and vsn standards were found to be higher than those computed based on the api csa and iso standards for a monopile structure however for ice loads acting on multi leg structures the snip and vsn standards provide higher values in comparison with loads from the other codes in order to design offshore structures all the uncertainties have to be considered this is required in order to ensure that the structures will be able to perform their intended function with sufficient confidence the traditional approach in order to deal with uncertainties is to utilize conservative value of the uncertain quantities or safety factors within a deterministic design framework however a statistical formulation is also needed owing to the large uncertainties associated with the underlying parameters of the sea ice properties a reliability based approach will be of benefit in order to enhance accuracy associated with prediction of extreme events and also permits to identify proper values of the underlying parameters that define the design values of the ice loading wang et al 2011 for numerical simulation of ice loading the discrete element modeling dem approach can be utilized tuhkuri and polojärvi 2018 there are serval advantages of such a modeling approach practically it can be employed to simulate the ice load on the structures in order to identify the influence of the relevant parameters before performing the physical experiments themselves due to the high cost and potential hazard associated with such experiments the numerical studies provides multiple benefits moreover the discrete element modeling approach is widely being used for estimation of design ice loads on the offshore structures this allows simulation of different design scenarios e g in terms of alternative structural configurations and ice conditions dem can be applied for simulation of both two and three dimensional cases and it allows analysis of both simple and complex ice structures interaction phenomena however only two dimensional solutions has no appropriate defined breaking pattern for complex structures with irregular geometry such as ship hulls the discrete element modeling approach has been widely applied for estimation of ice loads hisette et al 2017 lau et al 2011 however this approach requires extensive computer resources and such simulations are rather time consuming typically upper bound values of the loads are obtained based on extremely severe combinations of the relevant input simulation parameters alternatively repeated simulations with discrete elements models can be performed with different values of the relevant input parameters which results in significant computational efforts the objective of this work is to investigate the uncertainty associated with global ice loads based on the formulation given in the iso standard which has been widely using within the offshore industry it is emphasized that in the present study only the statistical scatter of the parameters which are input to calculation of pressure and load are considered while the model uncertainty associated with the formulation itself is not addressed the ice structure interaction is split into two different scenarios i e vertical versus sloping structures the effects of correlation between key load parameters are accounted for by application of the nataf transformation model in order to generate the joint probability distribution based on data obtained from field experiments furthermore the monte carlo simulation technique is applied in order to assess the uncertainties associated with the ice pressure and global ice load for the two different scenarios 2 environmental condition 2 1 ice thickness ice thickness is the most important parameter when it comes to the resulting magnitude of the global loading on a structure with a given geometry the present study focuses on first year sea ice conditions for which the ice thickness conditions are different from multi year ice the data related to the maximum annual thickness of level ice is obtained from estimation of air temperature at rödkallen meteorological station shmi 2019 in northern gulf of bothnia sea this station can be used to estimate the ice thickness for the norströmsgrund lighthouse which is located 23 6 km in north east direction of the station the observation of the level ice thickness has been measured since 1912 however a detailed documentation of the measurement sites is not available possibly the measurement sites might have been moved or the environment has changed during the extended observation period ronkainen et al 2018 for the present research the values of maximum annual level ice thickness from 1952 to 2015 are obtained from li et al 2016 from 2016 to 2018 the ice growth model of zubov 1943 which is the same procedure as applied by li et al 2016 is employed in order to estimate the annual maximum values of level ice thickness the formulation of the ice growth prediction by zubov model is given in equation 1 1 h i 2 50 h i 8 f d d where h i denotes the estimated level ice thickness fdd is the accumulated freezing degree days which is calculated from the daily average temperature t d and the freezing temperature of sea water t f in the unit of celsius degree co as given in equation 2 2 f d d t f t d it is sufficient to include the daily average temperature below the freezing point of water the examples of estimation of the level ice thickness by applying the air temperature data obtained from 2000 to 2018 are illustrated in fig 1 the annual maximum of level ice thickness from the calculation of the air temperature by using freezing degree day with zubov model is validated by comparison with weekly in situ measurements of the ice thickness by drillings throughout the winter from the kemi station ronkainen et al 2018 which is located close to the rödkallen station the corresponding results are given in fig 3 fig 2 shows the annual maximum level ice thickness for 66 years the mean value and standard deviation of the thickness for the entire data series are equal to 0 66 and 0 17 m respectively various probabilistic models are fitted to the level ice thickness data e g the normal the lognormal the gamma the gumbel and the weibull distributions it was found that the normal distribution provides the most appropriate fitting for the level ice thickness as illustrated in fig 4 both the chi square and kolmogorov tests are applied in order to verify the applicability of this distribution at an adequate significance level 2 2 ice flexural strength typically sea ice fails in a flexural mode when it interacts with sloping structures this implies that the flexural strength of sea ice becomes a very important parameter for calculation of the ice loading this applies in particular to the case of thin ice and slender structures the texture of sea ice is dominated by a random alternation between layers with different properties this inhomogeneous feature of the physical characteristics of sea ice has a significant effect on the stochastic nature of the flexural strength flexural testing of sea ice can generally be carried out by three different methods according to the antarctic research institute aari recommendations these are the cantilever beam tests three points beam tests and small ice plate tests among these tests the cantilever beam test is the most reliable method because this test is conducted in situ which allows an assessment of sea ice flexural strength over the whole thickness relocation of the sample is also avoided disturbance due to relocation can easily generate inaccuracies associated with the test data the data set corresponding to flexural strength of sea ice in this study is obtained from timco and o brien 1994 it is collected during different winter seasons based on different test types temperature size of the beam etc both in the field and in the laboratory data for the flexural strength of sea ice as a function of the root brine volume taken from timco and o brien 1994 is shown in fig 5 the mean value and standard deviation of the sampled data for the flexural strength are equal to 0 479 and 0 264 mpa respectively different types of probabilistic models have been applied as candidates in order to fit the probability distribution of the flexural strength it is found that the weibull distribution given by eq 3 provides the most appropriate fit for the present data set the result of the fitting is shown in fig 6 and the scale parameter and shape parameter of the weibull distribution are determined as 0 5385 and 1 9655 based on regressions coefficients for the straight line fitted in the corresponding probability paper 3 f σ f β α σ f α β 1 exp σ f α β 2 3 ice strength coefficient cr the new formulation of the ice crushing load on the vertical structures with the iso 19906 standard was developed from the full scale measurement at the structures ice strength coefficients c r is introduced as a key parameter in order to estimates ice loading by including the effects of ice crushing strength temperature salinity etc into one coefficient paquette and brown 2017 the value of ice strength coefficient c r is depended on the ice properties which vary corresponding to the climate of the geographical area for deterministic analysis the iso standard offers the c r value for alternatives in specific region the extreme level ice event elie is recommended for the ultimate limit state uls design to ensure that no significant structural damage occurs for both global and local action with an acceptable low probability entire the service life of the structures the c r value is originally estimated from the extreme value prediction kärnä and masterson 2011 with 100 year return period in each specific region with 2 8 mpa for arctic area and 1 8 mpa for a temperature area iso 2010 this present research use the data of the measured local pressure on lighthouse in baltic sea to perform the probabilistic assessment the data of the strength coefficient c r is estimated from the maximum peak value of the panel pressures which were measured at the norströmsgrund lighthouse from 2000 to 2003 by kärnä and masterson 2011 and kärnä and yan 2006 the values of ice strength coefficient c r are estimated from the backward calculation of the measured ice pressure corresponding to the iso formulation the data of ice strength coefficients c r with the ice thickness are illustrated in fig 8 various probabilistic models are fitted to this data it was found that the weibull distribution provides the most appropriate fitting as illustrated in fig 7 the regression coefficients of the straight line fitting in the corresponding probability paper are applied these estimators correspond to shape and scale parameter of 4 5044 and 0 4456 respectively the formula for the probability density function of the weibull distribution is given in equation 4 which is of the same type as in equation 3 4 f c r β α c r α β 1 exp c r α β 2 4 correlation between the physical properties of sea ice from experiments for design of offshore structures with respect to ice loading the sea ice properties are employed as primary input parameters in order to estimate the ice loading for a given structural configuration the magnitudes of the ice loads on the structure are typically strongly dependent on the type of sea ice failure mechanism there are typically also important effects of the correlation between the ice parameters and the resulting load magnitude estimation of these correlation coefficients based on and consideration of underlying physical mechanisms were studied by leira et al 2019 available datasets giving the relationship between the ice properties and the underlying basic variables e g the air temperature can be utilized for the purposed of quantifying the correlation coefficients between these properties for vertical structures the ice thickness and ice strength coefficient are employed as the key parameters in order to estimate the design ice loading based on iso 2010 correlation between the ice thickness and the ice strength coefficient was estimated based on data obtained from load panels attached to the norströmsgrund lighthouse in the baltic sea the width of the lighthouse at the level of the load panel instruments which are located at the cold water line cwl is 7 5m the data points were determined based on ice crushing events corresponding to peak pressures during stationary brittle crushing failure kärnä and masterson 2011 the degree of correlation between the ice thickness and the ice strength coefficient for different winter seasons during the period from 2000 to 2003 is estimated based on the measurements which correspond to the points shown in fig 8 it is found that the values of correlation coefficients vary between the different winter seasons in the range from 0 41 to 0 41 for sloping structures the ice thickness and the flexural strength are in some cases key parameters for estimation of the ice loading i e for relatively thin ice narrow structures and no snow this is due to the dominant ice failure mechanism for these cases being the flexural failure mode in general the flexural ice strength can be obtain from field experiments however field experiments carried out in cold regions have to deal with many kinds of difficulties such as limited budget time consuming operations and hard working condition etc in particularly performing flexural testing is very time consuming which implies that only a few tests can be carried out within a day period therefore the amount of field experimental data related to flexural strength of sea ice is quite limited for the present research data of flexural testing from different locations are selected in order to estimate the correlation between the ice thickness and the flexural strength estimation of flexural strength was carried out by means of cantilever beam tests the first and second data sets were digitized from langhorne and haskell 2004 who performed flexural testing by means of sea ice cantilever beams and by refreezing cracks of sea ice cantilever beams for the third and fourth data sets the flexural testing was conducted around the svalbard archipelago i e in svea bay and lance respectively in order to estimate sea ice properties in the north west barents sea ervik 2013 all experimental data for the flexural testing with different values of the ice thickness are illustrated in fig 9 the values of the correlation coefficient vary between the different data sets within the range from 0 32 to 0 76 the first data set represents conditions with thick level ice the thickness of the ice specimens varies from 1 79 m to 1 93 m the air temperature at the ice surface during the experiments was between 15 c and 21 c the correlation coefficient between the ice thickness and flexural strength for this data set has a negative value of 0 310 for second data set the specimens were refrozen from the first data set in order to perform flexural tests for the same weather condition the ice thickness of the refrozen specimens at the crack varied from 0 15m to 1 47m although the ice thickness of refrozen beams of the second data set is somewhat smaller than for the first data set the values of the correlation coefficient is 0 322 which is only slightly different from that for the first one more detailed information in relation to temperature and brine fraction profiles along the level ice thickness are given in langhorne and haskell 2004 for the third data set the flexural tests of sea ice were performed with six specimens of cantilever beams these had different lengths and widths with lengths in the interval 1 5 3 0m and widths in the interval 0 45 0 6m for the fourth data set the flexural tests of the cantilever beam specimens were performed with lengths of 7m 3 specimens 1 5m 1 specimens and 0 7m 2 specimens respectively during the experiments which were conducted in the north west barents sea air temperatures at the ice surface varied from about 9 c to 14 c ervik 2013 the flexural strength of the sea ice tends to increase with the ice thickness for the present data set the correlation coefficients for the third and fourth data sets are 0 764 and 0 566 respectively merging all the four data sets into one the estimated value of correlation coefficient between the ice thickness and ice flexural strength is found to be 0 660 3 theoretical background 3 1 probabilistic assessment the probabilistic assessment procedure in relation to ice structure interaction starts with exploration of the primary ice data associated with the specific site area under consideration i e data corresponding to ice thickness ice strength coefficient and flexural strength probabilistic models are fitted to the primary ice data in the present study the lowest to the highest values of the correlation coefficients are applied in conjunction with the nataf model more extensive samples of the random variables are generated for the key parameters by application of mcs techniques a flowchart illustrating the steps of the probabilistic assessment for ice loading is shown in fig 10 3 1 1 monte carlo simulation monte carlo simulation msc is used to carry out the probabilistic assessment of the loading due to ice structure interaction in the cases of vertical structures the samples correspond to different values of the ice thickness and the ice strength coefficient in order to investigate the uncertainty associated with the horizontal ice pressure and global ice loads in the case of sloping structures values of the flexural strength of sea ice are generated instead of the ice strength coefficient the sample values of the level ice thickness x i the flexural strength x j and the ice strength coefficient x k are generated from the inverted cdf of the normal distribution the weibull distribution and the weibull distribution respectively the sample values are generated based on random numbers drawn from a uniform distribution denoted by x u the corresponding sample values are given by equations 5 7 below with the sample size presently being equal to n 10 000 5 for the ice thickness x i f t h i c k n e s s 1 x u 6 for the flexural strength x j f f l e x u r a l 1 x u 7 for the ice strength coefficient x k f c r u s h i n g 1 x u the effects of introducing correlation between the key parameters are also investigated in this work for vertical structures these parameters are the ice thickness and ice strength coefficient while for sloping structures these are the ice thickness and the flexural strength independence between the basic variables corresponds to the correlation coefficient ρ being equals to 0 which is first applied as input to the mcs the scatter diagram with independent ice thickness and flexural strength for sloping structures is shown in the left part of fig 11 in the right part the corresponding scatter diagram for independent ice thickness and ice strength coefficient for vertical structures is shown subsequently the effect of introducing correlation between the variables is studied by application of the nataf transformation model 3 1 2 nataf transformation model typically there will exist correlation between the parameters which characterize the physical properties of sea ice this correlation can be estimated based on experimental data the nataf transformation model is able to represent this correlation structure in order to generate the corresponding joint probability density and distribution functions liu and der kiureghian 1986 the basic assumption behind the nataf transformation model is that the basic random variables representing the physical properties of sea ice can be obtained by transformation of corresponding gaussian variables z i z j z k and vice versa as given by equations 8 10 8 z i φ 1 f t h i c k n e s s x i 9 z j φ 1 f f l e x u r a l x j 10 z k φ 1 f c r u s h i n g x j the correlation coefficient ρ 0 i j between the two gaussian variables z i and z j is related to the correlation coefficient ρ i j between the thickness x i and flexural strength of sea ice x j the correlation between the random variables representing the physical parameters i e x i and x j is expressed as 11 ρ i j x i μ i σ i x j μ j σ j ϕ 2 z i z j ρ 0 i j d z i d z j where e x r μ r v a r x r σ r 2 r i j or r i k and ϕ 2 is the bivariate standard normal probability density function as given by equation 12 12 ϕ 2 z i z j ρ 0 i j 1 2 π 1 ρ 0 i j 2 exp z i 2 z j 2 2 ρ 0 i j z i z j 2 1 ρ 0 i j 2 in the gaussian plane the uncorrelated variables z i z j can be transformed to correlated variables z ˆ 1 and z ˆ 2 as expressed by equation 13 13 z ˆ i z ˆ j 1 0 ρ 1 ρ 2 z i z j for vertical structures the parameter x k representing the ice strength coefficients in equations 10 and 12 will be applied instead of the flexural strength of sea ice i e x j the nataf transformation model is valid for the entire range of the correlation coefficient i e between 1 and 1 in the present study the effect of the correlation between the key parameters of the ice loading acting on vertical and sloping structures is considered five values of the correlation coefficient ρ are applied and these are equal to 0 9 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 9 these cover the relevant range from the smallest to the highest values the upper and lower values for the correlation coefficient are set as 0 9 and 0 9 due to numerical limitations associated with the transformation i e the transformation matrix in eq 13 becomes singular in the limit as the absolute value of the correlation coefficient approaches 1 0 the corresponding scatter diagrams based on application of the nataf transformation model for different values of the correlation coefficient to perform the uncertain assessment of ice loading on vertical and sloping structures are demonstrated in figs 12 and 13 respectively 3 2 ice interaction with structures 3 2 1 ice load on vertical structures for vertical structures the mechanism of ice failure typically corresponds to the crushing mode the formulation of the ice pressure p g based on the iso 19906 standard is given in equation 14 14 p g c r h h 1 n w h m where c r is the ice strength coefficient h is the ice thickness h 1 is a reference thickness of 1 m w is the width of the structure m is an empirical coefficient equal to 0 16 n is an empirical coefficient equal to 0 5 h 5 for h 1 0 m and equal to 0 30 for h 1 0 m iso 2010 for ice crushing against a vertical structure the global ice load f g occurs perpendicular to the contact surface according to the limit mechanism of ice failure and is expressed in terms of equation 15 15 f g p g h w in the present study different structural widths are considered i e 1 m 4m and 10m this is in order to investigate the resulting influence of the width on the computed ice pressure and the global ice force in connection with the probabilistic assessment based on application of monte carlo simulation 3 2 2 ice load on sloping structures in the present study focus is on ice loading calculated according to the formula suggested by the iso 19906 standard which is based on the theory of beam bending on an elastic foundation croasdale and cammaert 1994 iso 2010 inclined slope configurations can be divided into two main categories which correspond to upward and downward slopes as illustrated in figs 14 and 15 respectively in the case of downward sloping structures the weight of the ice fragments or ice rubbles due to fracture of ice sheet will be considered as a submerged weight which takes into account the effect of buoyancy the major components of the global ice loads can be decomposed into the horizontal and vertical directions these components are functions of normal component n of ice action on the structure the sloping angle α and the friction coefficient μ s t of the surface roughness between sea ice and the structure the formula of horizontal ice force f h and vertical ice force f v can be expressed by equations 16 and 17 16 f h n sin α μ s t n cos α 17 f v n cos α μ s t n sin α the loading ratio ξ calculated from the horizontal and vertical ice load components is expressed by equation 18 18 ξ f h f v sin α μ cos α cos α μ sin α in the iso 19906 standard the horizontal global ice load is subdivided into five components according to the interaction mechanism these are as follows the breaking load h b the load component required to push the sheet ice through the ice rubble h p the load required in order to push the ice blocks up the slope through the ice rubble h r the load required to lift the ice rubble on top of the advancing ice sheet prior to breaking it h l and the load needed to turn the ice block at the top of the slope h t this formulation is expressed by means of equation 19 19 f h h b h p h r h l h t 1 h b σ f l c h where l c is the total length of the circumferential crack the breaking load component h b is the major loading which corresponds to bending of ice sheet which invokes the flexural strength σ f of the sea ice and results in the following expression 20 h b 0 68 ξ σ f ρ w g h 5 e 0 25 w π 2 l c 4 where ρ w is the density of seawater g is gravitational acceleration w is the width of the structure during the ice structure interaction the length of the ice sheet between the interaction domain and the location of the fracture position is referred to as the critical length l c the theoretical formulation for the critical length is based on elastic plate bending as given by equation 21 21 l c e h 3 12 ρ w g 1 υ 2 1 4 where e and υ is the elastic modulus and the poisson ratio respectively in order to push the advancing ice sheet through the ice rubble the load component h p arises which is given as 22 h p w h r 2 μ i ρ i g 1 e 1 tan θ tan α 2 1 2 tan θ where h r is the rubble height μ i is the friction coefficient of ice to ice rubble ρ i is the density of the sea ice e is the porosity of the ice rubble θ is the angle the rubble makes with the horizontal plane the additional force required in order to push the ice blocks up the slope through the ice rubble is the load component h r as given by equation 23 23 h r w p 1 cos α μ s t sin α the parameter p is expressed by equation 24 24 p 0 5 μ i μ i μ s t ρ i g 1 e h r 2 sin α 1 tan θ 1 tan α 1 tan θ tan α 0 5 μ i μ s t ρ i g 1 e h r 2 cos α tan α 1 tan θ tan α h r h ρ i g sin α μ s t cos α sin α the load component h l is given in equation 25 25 h l 0 5 w h r 2 ρ i g 1 e ξ 1 tan θ 1 tan α 1 tan θ tan α 0 5 w h r 2 ρ i g 1 e ξ tan φ 1 tan θ tan α 2 ξ c w h r 1 tan θ tan α where c is the cohesion of the ice rubble and φ is the corresponding friction angle the load component h t is due to turning of the ice block at the top of the slope as given by equation 26 26 h t 1 5 w h 2 ρ i g cos α sin α μ s t cos α during the interaction between the ice and the sloping structure the extent of ride up of the rubble pile is significantly enlarged due to accumulation of ice fragments empirical formulas obtained from data collected at the kemi i lighthouse and the confederation bridge are applied in order to calculate the rubble pile height brown and määttänen 2009 the heights of ice ride up or rubble pile up are related to the water level or the level ice surface for the kemi i lighthouse the rubble pile up height increases linearly as illustrated in equation 27 for the confederation bridge the rubble pile up increases according to a power law function as given in equation 28 27 h r 3 4 h 28 h r 7 64 h 0 64 the relationship between rubble pile up height versus level ice thickness are illustrated in fig 16 the rubble pile up height is a function of the level ice thickness the pdf of the rubble pile up height can be calculated by using a one to one transformation for the monotonously increasing function which is given in equation 29 two different rubble pile up height pdfs are plotted in fig 16 for two different cases i e the kemi i light house and the confederation bridge in this analysis the confederation bridge formula is applied to calculate the rubble pile up height because it provides higher value from the estimation which can be observed from the pdfs in fig 16 therefore more conservative global forces would be estimated 29 f h r h r f h i h g 1 h r d h d h r where g is the functional relationship of rubble pile up height in the relevant area of level ice thickness as illustrated in fig 17 the sea ice will get in contact with the surface area of the structures during the interaction the friction coefficient is therefore important to estimate the global ice loading the value of the friction coefficient between the sea ice and the structure saeki et al 1986 depends on the temperature contact speed and surface roughness the value of the friction coefficient for the present analysis is based on the average value of ice drift speed in the barents sea as given in table 1 the input parameters for investigation of the uncertainty associate with the global ice load on sloping structures i e upwards or downwards based on formulation of iso 19906 2010 are presented in table 1 in addition the analysis considers ice breaking in both the upward and downward directions each slope category is divided into three different angles as listed in table 2 4 results according to the ice loads on structures obtained by application of the iso standard the analysis of ice load is different for vertical versus sloping structures basically this is due to the sea ice failure mechanisms being different for the two cases which correspond to the crushing mode and the flexural mode respectively 4 1 vertical structures in the first part below results for the average ice pressure and the global ice loads on vertical structures are presented the ice pressure is found to be a decrease function when the structural width and ice thickness increase due to the scaling effect interestingly the values of the ice pressure increase dramatically when the ice thickness is lower than 0 25 m as illustrated in figs 18 and 19 a this is because of the power term of aspect ratio from iso formulation in equation 14 furthermore the global ice forces on the vertical structures demonstrates an increasing function with the ice thickness the width of the structure and the ice strength coefficient as illustrated in fig 19 b the results imply that the range of thin ice thickness provides the higher ice pressure on the local members of the structures which may leads to higher local member stresses moreover the average ice pressure of iso formulation does not take into account the effect of the imperfection of the contract area in the high pressure zone or critical zone which can promote the higher local ice pressure due to the confinement during of the ice structure interactions process nevertheless jordaan 2001 found that the high pressure zone of the contact area in case of thin ice is not significant for local ice pressure as part of the probabilistic assessment the effects of correlation between the ice thickness and the ice strength coefficient in connection with ice pressures and global ice forces based on the nataf transformation model are investigated numerical samples based on the nataf transformation model for a correlation coefficient equal to 0 5 in the planes of average ice pressure and global ice force are shown in fig 20 it can be seen that some data points from the numerical samples are located in the region where scale effects are important higher negative values of the correlation coefficients between the ice thickness and the ice strength coefficient tend to generate more sample data points in the region where scale effects are of significance however those sample points do not correspond to high values of the global ice force the statistical parameters based on the mcs results for vertical structures are given in table 3 in terms of mean value standard deviation and coefficient of variation cov of the ice pressure per square metre and global ice load the cov indicates the degree of dispersion of the probability distribution of the ice loads slender structures i e with small width tend to exhibit higher mean values of the ice pressure per square metre than wider structures owing to the scale effect of sea ice the lower correlation between ice thickness and ice strength coefficient demonstrates higher uncertainty for average ice pressures which can be observed from the higher values of cov and standard deviation on the contrary the uncertainty in the global ice forces demonstrates the opposite trends which values of standard and covs increase according to the effect of correlation between ice thickness and ice strength coefficient the results of the ice pressure and global ice loading are presented in the box and whisker diagram to illustrate the data distribution in the connection with the interquartile range iqr the iqr is defined from the 25th percentile q1 and the 75th percentile q3 as iqr q3 q1 the middle line inside each of the rectangular boxes demonstrates the median and whiskers above and below the box demonstrates the location of the minimum and maximum of 1 5 iqr lower values of the correlation coefficient between the ice thickness and the ice strength coefficient for average ice pressure implies a high level of dispersion which also means that a larger number of data points will exceed the maximum whisker limits as illustrated in fig 21 on the contrary the results for the global ice forces exhibit an opposite trend as illustrated in fig 22 for each box and whisker diagram of the ice pressure and the ice force the central mark indicates the median and the bottom and top edges of the box indicate q1 25th percentiles and q3 75th percentiles respectively the bottom and top whiskers limits indicate q1 1 5 iqr and q3 1 5 iqr respectively https ch mathworks com help stats boxplot html the samples obtained based on the monte carlo simulation are applied for the purpose of distribution fitting this allows us to investigate the statistical characteristic of the global ice loads for vertical structures an example of a quality plot for fitting the average ice pressure and global ice forces acting on vertical structure for a correlation coefficient ρ 0 5 and a width of 1 00 m by application of the weibull distribution is illustrated in fig 23 the correlation coefficient has a significant effect on the shape of the probability density function of the average ice pressure and global ice forces the flat shape of pdf implies the higher dispersion or uncertainty which contains inside the random variables the average ice pressure trends to have flatter shape when the value of correlation coefficients between ice thickness and ice strength coefficient decrease whereas the opposite trend between the average ice pressure and global ice forces also addresses on the pdfs the weibull probability density functions pdf of ice pressures and global ice loading are displayed in fig 24 the effect of varying correlation on the average ice pressure can also be studied by comparison of the respective cumulative density functions cdf for different values of the correlation coefficients these are shown the same trends with pdfs as illustrated in fig 25 in which the effect of structural width is also illustrated 4 2 sloping structures for sloping structures the global ice loads from the iso formulation increase significantly with increasingly steeper slopes in both the upward and downward slope directions the magnitude for the global ice loads in the horizontal direction are higher than those in the vertical direction and the values of ice load in the horizontal direction is more sensitive to the sloping angles than vertical direction which can be observed in fig 26 for monte carlo simulation the samples of vertical and horizontal ice loads are generated from the basic variables of ice thickness and flexural strength based on the iso formulation after that the application of nataf transformation model is applied to simulate the dependency between the basic variables corresponding to the correlation coefficient ρ the examples of scatter diagrams for horizontal and vertical loads with dependent correlation coefficient between ice thickness and flexural strength for upward and downward slopes directions are shown in figs 27 and 28 respectively the statistical parameters of the horizontal and vertical ice loads on sloping structures in upward and downward direction given in terms of mean values standard deviations covs and kurtosis are listed in tables 4 and 5 respectively the results for the ice loads on sloping structure can be indicated the level of uncertainties by using statistical parameter with coefficient of variation cov for global horizontal ice load steeper slope geometries provide higher loading magnitudes and higher uncertainties the values of the cov are increasing with steeper slopes and higher value of correlation coefficients between ice thickness and flexural strength the breaking load component h b is the major loading which corresponds to the bending of the ice sheet to invoke the flexural failure of the sea ice the global vertical ice loads on the sloping structures are also demonstrated the same pattern with the horizontal ice loads however the mean values of ice loading do not change so much with varying sloping angles higher correlation between the ice thickness and flexural strength leads to higher dispersion of pdfs which corresponds to higher statistical uncertainty the value of the cov demonstrates an increasing function of the correlation coefficient for both upward and downward sloping structures the results of horizontal and vertical ice forces on the sloping structure are demonstrated in the box and whisker diagram to present the data in the interquartile range iqr for horizontal ice force the higher correlation coefficients between ice thickness and flexural strength provide higher uncertainty which can be observed from the longer length of box spans and whisker length as illustrated in fig 29 whereas the vertical ice forces present almost the same trend of data distributions with horizontal ice forces when changing slop angles the uncertainty related to vertical ice forces are mainly dependent on the correlation coefficients between ice thickness and flexural strength however the median of the vertical ice force does not vary much in comparison with the horizontal ice forces as shown in fig 30 for each box and whisker diagram for the horizontal and the vertical ice forces the central mark indicates the median and the bottom and top edges of the box indicate q1 25th percentiles and q3 75th percentiles respectively the bottom and top whisker limits indicate q1 1 5 iqr and q3 1 5 iqr respectively various types of probabilistic models have been applied as the candidates to fit the distributive results of horizontal and vertical ice forces as a result the weibull distribution provide the most appropriate fit for the component of global ice force on the sloping structures the example of the pdf fitting with horizontal and vertical ice force by the weibull distribution is illustrated in fig 31 flatter slopes provide significantly reduction for the loading magnitude in horizontal direction owning to the transformation of failure mechanism of sea ice from crushing mode to bending mode the uncertainty of global ice loads on sloping structure in upward and downward directions can also be observed in the pdfs as shown in figs 30 and 31 respectively the correlation coefficients between the ice thickness and flexural strength of sea ice demonstrate a significant effect to the shapes of pdf for the global ice loading the shapes of pdfs are flatter when the values of correlation coefficient in both upward and downward directions increase for the slope angle the results of uncertainty assessment present the significant effects only in the horizontal direction of ice loading the steeper slopes provide the higher dispersion and higher uncertainty in the global horizontal ice forces as shown in fig 32 however the slope effect is not obviously presented in the vertical ice forces which can be seen in the shape of pdfs as illustrated in fig 33 furthermore the results of uncertainty assessment for sloping structures can be summarized in cdfs as illustrated in fig 34 5 discussion intrinsically sea ice properties are associated with a high uncertainty level due to the corresponding large differences between the maximum and minimum values of the parameters which enter the expressions for calculation of the ice loading the effect of correlation between the parameters can be expected to be significant i e high high high low or low low combinations this effect is considered in the present study furthermore based on different experimental data sets obtained from field measurements figs 8 and 9 we found that there exists a certain degree of correlation between key design parameters for both vertical and sloping structures based on a probabilistic analysis the effect of correlation between sea ice properties on the computed ice loads can be readily taken into account this is achieved by utilization of multivariate probability density functions which include the relevant correlation coefficients as explicit parameters in combination with monte carlo simulation techniques the corresponding effect on the resulting ice load magnitude which is calculated based on the formulation in the widely applied iso standard can then be quantified for the analysis correlation coefficient values in the entire range from the lowest to highest values are considered i e between 1 and 1 for computational purposes the correlation coefficient is assigned values in the range from 0 9 to 0 9 in order to avoid numerical problems the degree of uncertainty associated with the ice loads is quantified in terms of the coefficient of variation i e the cov high values of the cov imply high levels of uncertainty moreover the levels of uncertainty can also be observed based on the shape of the pdfs and cdfs i e flatter shape of the pdfs and a smaller slope of the cdfs imply higher levels of uncertainty characteristic values of the ice loads to be applied for design purposes can be determined by means of upper fractiles of the corresponding probability distributions ditlevsen and madsen 1996 increasing uncertainty levels imply that the ratio of a given fractile to the mean value will increase accordingly for design purpose the characteristic values of the loads i e the fractile values are subsequently multiplied partial load coefficients in order to ensure an adequate level of structural reliability ditlevsen and madsen 1996 typically characteristic design values for external loads are taken to be the 95 fractile or above in the present study the 99 fractile is utilized in order to demonstrate the influence from the degree of correlation between key design parameters on the resulting ice loading for both vertical and sloping structures 5 1 vertical structures for calculation of ice loads acting on vertical structures based on the iso standard the ice thickness and ice strength coefficient are key parameters for estimation of the ice pressure and the global ice forces the correlation coefficients between these quantities can be estimated based on measurements of loads acting on panels which are attached to the structures values of the observed correlation between the ice thickness and the ice strength coefficient from four experiments are 0 574 0 408 0 014 and 0 413 respectively the observed values of the correlation coefficient tends to be in the negative side which can also be observed from fig 8 in section 2 4 it is found that the effects of changing the correlation coefficient between ice thickness and ice strength coefficient exhibit opposite trends for the ice pressure versus the global ice force this is clearly observed from the pdfs and cdfs of the ice pressure and global ice force in figs 24 and 25 the relevant statistical parameters for calculation of the 99 fractiles of the ice pressure and global ice force are listed in table 3 the effect of varying the correlation coefficient on this fractile for the ice pressure and global ice load is shown in figs 35 and 36 respectively as seen from fig 35a negative values of the correlation coefficient imply higher values of the 99 fractile for the ice pressure on the contrary fig 36a shows that positive values of correlation coefficient provides higher values of 99 fractile for the global ice force this can be further demonstrated by normalizing the 99 fractiles with the value corresponding to zero correlation as can be seen from fig 35b there is a 30 decrease of the ice pressure by going from a value of the correlation coefficient of 0 0 9 for the global horizontal force there is instead and increase of 40 for the same case as seen from fig 36b respectively 5 2 sloping structures for sloping structures the level ice thickness rubble pile up height and the flexural strength are in some cases important parameters to estimate the ice loading e g for thin ice narrow structures and no snow in this analysis the distributions of accumulated rubble pile up height according to the empirical formulas from data collected at the kemi lighthouse and at the confederation bridge were estimated based on the probability density functions of level ice thickness by using a one to one transformation corresponding to a monotonously increasing function it found that the results for the confederation bridge provide the highest values which can be observed from the pdf of the rubble pile up height in fig 16 therefore the results for the confederation bridge are employed in the computation in order to obtain more conservative global forces subsequently the two parameters corresponding to thickness of the level ice and ice flexural strength represent the key parameters in order to estimate the ice loading on sloping structures in the present study the effects of varying correlation between level ice thickness and ice flexural strength is considered the correlation coefficient between these quantities was estimated based on data obtained from field measurements at different locations and with different weather conditions the results of these measurements are illustrated by means of joint sets of data points in fig 9 in section 2 4 the values of correlation coefficient which was estimated from each of the data sets are found to be 0 310 0 322 0 764 and 0 566 respectively merging all the data sets the correlation coefficients was estimated as 0 66 the effects of varying the correlation coefficient on the resulting pdfs and cdfs are illustrated by the results in figs 32 34 the corresponding values of the cov are listed in tables 4 and 5 the variation of the value of the 99 fractile resulting from variation of the correlation coefficient is shown in fig 37 a horizontal force and 38b vertical force for different values of the sloping angle the corresponding results obtained by normalizing the 99 fractile of the global horizontal and vertical forces with the values corresponding to zero correlation are shown in figs 37b and 38 b it is seen that there is an increase of about 60 when going from a correlation coefficient of zero to 0 9 for both the horizontal and the vertical load components the action factors and action combination factors for iso 19906 2010 to be applied for the ultimate limit state uls and the abnormal limit state als in relation to environmental actions including ice loads are about 1 35 and 1 10 for respectively the highest and the intermediate exposure levels in the present study the effects of correlation between key design parameters with respect to the calculated ice loads are quantified by comparison with the case of zero correlation the normalized values of the global ice loads increase approximately 40 and 60 for a correlation coefficient of 0 9 as compared to the case with zero correlation for the case of vertical and sloping structures respectively however the correlation between the relevant design parameters will usually have a value between 0 and 0 9 and it can also be negative therefore more extensive studies of the proper correlation to be applied for calculation of design ice loads than those reported in the literature should be performed this could result in load parameter combination factors to be applied for selection of joint parameter values to be applied for design purposes 6 conclusions a probabilistic assessment of loads due to ice structure interaction based on the formula in the iso standard has been performed by means of monte carlo simulation techniques two types of structures are analysed i e with vertical and sloping configurations respectively the correlation coefficient between the ice strength coefficient and the ice thickness as well as the correlation coefficient between the flexural strength and the ice thickness were estimated and the corresponding effects on the uncertainties associated with the ice loads were investigated for varying values of the correlation coefficients the degree of uncertainty associated with the ice loads was quantified in terms of cov values i e higher values of the cov imply higher levels of uncertainty for practical design the fractile values are usually employed in combination with the partial load factors in order to ensure adequate structural reliability levels our analysis shows that both the global ice force and its associated uncertainty increased for high values of the correlation coefficients as compared to the case with zero correlation for vertical structures the mean values the standard deviations the covs and the 99 fractile of the global forces increased by approximately 10 40 30 and 40 respectively when going from a correlation coefficient of 0 0 9 for sloping structures the mean value the standard deviation the cov and the 99 fractile of the global horizontal and vertical forces increase by approximately 20 60 35 and 60 respectively when going from a correlation coefficient of 0 0 9 for sloping structures higher values of the sloping angles imply higher values of the standard deviation this applies accordingly also to the cov and the fractile values associated with the global forces changing the slope angle will have a stronger influence on the mean values the standard deviations the covs and the fractile values for the global forces in the horizontal direction as compared to the global forces in the vertical direction quantification of the uncertainty associated with the environmental ice loading on offshore structures is required in order to enhance the accuracy associated with choice of partial load factors for structural design purposes this applies to the limit state design this also implies an increase of the reliability level of the structures during their operation due to more accurate information accordingly the types of probability density functions and the values of the relevant correlation coefficients for a proper statistical characterization of sea ice loading should be selected with care this is in order to perform a precise assessment of the structural reliability level associated with design of offshore structures in the regions being considered it is emphasized that model uncertainties associated with the applied load models have not been included as part of the present study in order to assess the implied safety level associated with application of the given design formulas and corresponding partial coefficients such model uncertainty factors are also required and will be

22087,in many advanced control strategies the wave excitation force is key to determining the control input however it is often difficult to measure the excitation force on a wave energy converter wec the use of kalman filters to estimate the wave excitation force based on readily available measurement data can potentially fill the gap between the development of wec control strategies and the data that is available two different estimation methods using an nonlinear extended kalman filter are tested on experimental wave tank data for a heaving semi submerged float the first method relies on directly including the excitation force as a state in the first order dynamics which allows the random walk of the kalman filter to identify an estimate of the excitation force the second method of estimation involves modeling the wave excitation force as a harmonic oscillator comprised of sinusoidal components both methods are evaluated for a variety of incident waves and additional sensitivity analyses are performed to investigate the susceptibility of these estimation methods to changes in the model measurement noise and sampling rate keywords wave energy converter nonlinear model excitation force estimation extended kalman filter 1 introduction wave energy converters wecs are devices that generate electricity from ocean waves some non exhaustive reviews of the widely varying devices and modeling methods for wecs can be found in day et al 2015 falnes 2007 li and yu 2012 and folley 2016 this work will focus specifically on point absorbing wave energy converters point absorbing type wecs rely on a small body when compared to the incident wavelength to be actuated primarily in a single degree of freedom to achieve power generation modern control strategies rely on state information to calculate an optimal control input as addressed in brekken 2011 and ling and batten 2015 this is possible through the use of kalman filters as optimal state observers kalman filters can also be used to estimate the wave excitation force which is necessary for many controllers ling and batten 2015 nguyen and tona 2017 even though kalman filters are commonly used to estimate the states for control systems the implementation of a kalman filter on a wec is not trivial this work addresses some of the current barriers to state observation and excitation force estimation of wave energy converters using an extended kalman filter ekf which is the nonlinear adaptation of the kalman filter the use of an ekf to determine wave excitation force using external pressure sensors is shown in abdelkhalik et al 2016 however the implementation of additional external pressure sensors may be impractical for many commercial wec applications alternatively ling and batten 2015 shows a way to use a kalman filter to estimate the exitation force by modeling the excitation force as a disturbance in the wec equations of motion the disturbance used in ling and batten 2015 describes the excitation force as a sum of sinusoids as is typical in wec modeling folley 2016 this method of estimating the wave excitation force will be referred to as the disturbance estimation method using a different approach a linear kalman filter is implemented in nguyen and tona 2017 where the excitation force is identified by including the force as a state with no dynamics and thereby allowing the random walk of the kalman filter to identify the best estimate of the state directly this methodology of implementing the kalman filter to identify the wave excitation force will be referred to as the direct estimation method the work of nguyen and tona 2017 also develops a receding horizon estimator which requires the solution of a dynamic programming problem at each time step estimation using the receding horizon method results in increased computational complexity but provides very little phase lag between the estimated and true excitation forces nguyen and tona 2017 a similar disturbance model estimation method to ling and batten 2015 is abril et al 2017 where a linear kalman filter is used on simulation data to perform an investigation into excitation force estimation and prediction the direct estimation method shown in nguyen and tona 2017 applies the same principle that is used for drag estimation in davis and fabien 2018 and unknown parameter identification in crassidis and junkins 2011 the work of faedo et al 2017 provides an overview of control algorithms many of which rely on the use of a linear kalman filter excitation force prediction is of primary interest in the overview faedo et al 2017 this work describes the implementation of an extended kalman filter that uses a nonlinear continuous time model and discrete time measurements the use of a nonlinear kalman filter enables the inclusion of the nonlinear morison drag term that has become commonly included in many lumped parameter models and wec modeling software packages bhinder et al 2015 combourieu et al 2015 the implementation and sensitivity analysis of wave excitation force estimation with an extended kalman filter on experimental data from bosma et al 2015 is described using both the direct estimation and disturbance estimation methods the considerations that need to be taken into account when implementing these two methods with a nonlinear model are given and the sensitivity of the estimation methods to various conditions are investigated the work described in this paper is differentiated from previous literature in this field by providing the following contributions the excitation force estimation is performed on experimental wave tank data the implementation of a nonlinear extended kalman filter made use of two different methods of adapting the kalman filter to estimate the excitation force the inclusion of an estimated velocity for the water surrounding the float allows for the nonlinear morison drag term to be used in the model the sensitivity of the estimation algorithm to measurement noise wave climate sampling rate radiation realization and the number of frequencies that are used to model the excitation force are studied an equal energy approach is taken to choose the wave frequencies that comprise the disturbance model of the wave excitation force this work provides insight into the implementation of a nonlinear kalman filter with experimental data for wave energy conversion reproducible methods are described to facilitate implementation of the ekf for excitation force estimation and an investigation of the limitations of the ekf is performed to help ensure the suitability of the application the purpose of this work is to enhance the performance of state observers when estimating the wave excitation force acting on wecs with the goal of enabling more effective feedback control advanced control strategies such as latching control or model predictive control mpc offer increased power production when compared to traditional wec control strategies hong et al 2014 brekken 2011 optimal power absorption is achieved when the phase of the wec velocity is properly aligned with the wave excitation force to this end latching control uses an actuator to lock a wec in a specific configuration long enough for the wec to achieve the optimal phase with the excitation force falnes 2007 model predictive control is a method that solve a series of successive small time horizon optimal control problems tom and yeung 2015 the optimal control problem is solved for a future timespan and takes into account the current wave climate when determining the optimal control input however a short prediction of incident wave elevation or wave excitation force is necessary to implement this type of controller fusco and ringwood 2012 as the wave excitation force estimation is enhanced forecasting methods can be better implemented to provide the necessary time horizons for predictive and latching control methods sections 2 and 3 describe the mathematical model and the experimental tests used in the development and implementation of the algorithms in this work respectively a description of the identification algorithms developed and the excitation force estimation results along with sensitivity analyses are given in sections 4 and 5 finally section 6 contains concluding remarks on the work presented 2 wave energy converter model the potential based time domain integro differential equation analyzed in babarit et al 2012 has become the most prolific lumped parameter model for a wec equation of motion eom however semi empirical models or simplified lumped parameter models are also possible for wecs as shown in the detailed modeling description given in davis and fabien 2018 the equation of motion of a semi submerged body in heave is given by 1 m v y f b f d f r f m f e x where the inertial force of the object is the product of the virtual mass m v and the heave acceleration y this virtual mass is the sum of the mass of the body and the infinite frequency added mass of the entrained fluid as is traditionally used in the cummins formulation cummins 1962 the terms used in 1 are defined as f b is the hyrdostatic force on the object f d is the viscous drag force f r is the radiation damping f m is the restoring force from mooring lines f e x is the wave excitation force and the displacement of the body is y the dot notation represents derivatives with respect to time for example y d y d t and y d 2 y d t 2 discussion of the simplification of a general equation of motion to the form shown in 1 can be found in davis and fabien 2018 the potential flow based force terms of 1 are developed in agreement with the cummins equation cummins 1962 which was originally developed to describe the motion of ships and is now applied to semi submerged floating bodies the work of davis and fabien 2015 shows that the nonlinear viscous drag force is significant for wave followers and the work of combourieu et al 2015 shows the necessity of the nonlinear viscous drag for modeling software as a result the viscous drag term will be included as a nonlinear term in 1 the viscous drag term is the lone nonlinear term in 1 as described in babarit et al 2012 and bhinder et al 2015 and the inertial excitation restoring and radiation forces are assumed to be linear for the following development 2 1 mooring and hydrostatic forces f m and f b the forces resulting from mooring and umbilical cables are modeled together as the product of a constant parameter and the body displacement as given by the linear relationship 2 f m k m u y where k m u is lumped linear spring constant describing the forces acting on the body by the mooring lines and umbilical cable and y is the displacement from the static equilibrium point by modeling the response of the body from the equilibrium position as with the hydrostatic restoring force only a linear relationship is needed to determine the vertical force contribution of the cables as a function of heave position the constant can be determined experimentally using load cells and displacement measurements described in section 3 the hydrostatic restoring force is determined by 3 f b ρ g a y where a is the projected area of the submerged volume at the calm water surface ρ is the density g is the gravitational acceleration constant and y is the displacement from the static equilibrium it is important to note that 3 assumes that a constant area is being submerged 2 2 drag force f d the viscous drag is modeled using a quadratic morison drag form chakrabarti 2005 and zurkinden et al 2014 the drag in the heave direction is given by 4 f d 1 2 ρ a p c d v v b y where v is the relative velocity between the object and the water particles surrounding it the density of the fluid is given by ρ and a p is the projected area of the object in the heave direction a signed velocity square term is computed by taking the product of velocity v and the absolute value of the velocity v finally the drag coefficient is given by c d the relative velocity v ensures that the drag force is not over predicted if the velocity of the ocean wave was neglected then a large viscous drag force would be calculated any time the body is oscillating in phase with the incident wave a case where the drag should be small since there would be very little motion between the body and the impinging water particles an approach to estimating the vertical water velocity can be found in section 4 3 2 a discussion on the treatment of the viscous drag force as well as an identification method can be found in davis and fabien 2018 a small linear damping force b y is included to compensate for the fluid shear forces acting on the body and linear damping in the mooring lines the coefficient b is based on the experimental response of the body at low velocities 2 3 radiation force f r the force acting on the wec that results from radiated waves is calculated in the time domain through the use of the convolution integral as illustrated in cummins 1962 a state space realization of the convolution integral is created as an efficient method of computing the radiation force the state space representation of the radiation force can be formed as 5 x r t a r x r t b r y t 6 f r c r x r t where x r is the state variable of the realization the state matrices a r b r and c r are a non unique linear realization of the convolution integral and are generated from the impulse response function kristiansen et al 2005 of the system a more detailed description of the fourier transform inversion and computational considerations of describing the radiation force as a state space system is given in davis and fabien 2018 2 4 excitation force f e x the wave excitation force can be calculated using the excitation force impulse response function irf f i r f t and the wave surface elevation y w using the convolution integral 7 f e x t f i r f τ y w t τ d τ this convolution is used to compute the true value of the excitation force for this work as shown in ling and batten 2015 and falnes 2002 the time range of the numerical integration is truncated to be longer than the active response of the excitation irf which is determined by applying the inverse fourier transform on the frequency dependant excitation force calculated from a bem falnes 2002 3 available data experimental data was made available by the oregon state university northwest national marine renewable energy center s marine and hydrokinetics open data project nnmrec 2017 the data set that is used in this work was a physical model test of a 1 10 scale floating power system at the coast lab at plymouth university bosma et al 2015 the deep water tests described in bosma et al 2015 is used to determine the parameters in the equations of motion the mooring study described in bosma et al 2015 used a wave tank to compare several mooring configurations of two bodies in water of these two bodies the scaled floating power system fps is analyzed in this current work as it provides a very similar geometry to the float of a point absorbing wec the fps is shown in fig 1 in the wave tank prior to wave generation for this work a subset of experimental runs were chosen seventeen different panchromatic runs using an elastic o rings as moorings are used to test the kalman filter estimation algorithm in section 5 these moorings act as springs and allow for displacement in all six degrees of freedom the work of

and the bandwidth b of the incident wave spectra each data set had roughly six hundred seconds of data collected incident wave elevation and mooring line forces were measured at 128 hz and motion data was recorded at a sampling frequency of 200 hz irregular waves were generated using the bretshneider spectrum 3 1 reproducing numerical work detailed descriptions of the experiments along with wave

radiation damping and added mass as a function of angular frequency for the fps the magnitude and phase of the wave excitation force on the fps is shown as a function of angular frequency in fig 3 the

outputs a model and gaussian error description to determine a statistically significant estimate of the state dynamics a nonlinear continuous time model with discrete time experimental data points can be observed using a continuous discrete extended kalman filter the ekf is a nonlinear adaptation of the kalman filter which observes a dynamic system in which zero mean gaussian white noise is assumed in both the dynamics and measurement the model that is observed by the extended kalman filter is described by 8 x t f x t u t t g t w t 9 y t h x t t v t where f is the nonlinear state dynamics h is the nonlinear output function g t is a vector that describes the noise of each state w t is zero mean gaussian white noise with a variance q t and v t is zero mean gaussian white noise with a variance of r t the tilde symbol modifying the output y represents that this is an experimentally measured quantity the accuracy of the kalman filter relies on knowledge of the process and measurement noise terms correct quantification of the process noise is essential for the ekf to function effectively for discussions concerning the determination of the process noise covariance see crassidis and junkins 2011 and mehra 1970 and section 4 3 1 since the ekf deals with nonlinear systems that must be integrated to determine state dynamics reasonable initial conditions must be used to ensure filter stability crassidis and junkins 2011 the kalman filter will iterate through the gain update and propagate steps for each discrete time in order to estimate the states of the system the gain step calculates a matrix of gains that is used to correct a previous step s estimates based on the covariance of each state the update step uses the calculated gain to adjust the covariance of each state and estimated value based on the difference between estimated and measured states finally the propagation step calculates the covariance and state estimates of the next time step details on the theory of the continuous discrete ekf can be found in crassidis and junkins 2011 and the implementation of the algorithm on a wec application can be found in davis and fabien 2018 for this implementation of the ekf the joseph stabilized form of the covariance update equation is used and the symmetry of the covariance matrix is enforced by taking the element wise average of the covariance and its transpose at each step in order to use the kalman filter for estimation the model must be modified to provide the estimated parameter as a function of the observed states as described below 4 1 direct identification estimation to directly identify a force or parameter using the ekf the variable in question is appended as an extra state with no dynamics each state in the dynamics of a kalman filter undergoes a random walk to determine the best estimate of the state variable at each time step crassidis and junkins 2011 the nonlinear dynamics in 8 described in section 2 when reduced to a first order system is 10 x 1 x 2 x r x 2 1 m v f x 1 x 2 f e x y c r x r a r x r b r y where x r is a vector of radiation states x 1 and x 2 are the first order variables for position and velocity respectively and both f e x and y are inputs to the system representing wave excitation force and water velocity respectively the estimated wave excitation force can be used to provide a functional estimate of the water velocity surrounding the wec as described in section 4 3 2 the inclusion of f e x as an estimated force necessitates the inclusion of another state in the dynamics as 11 x 1 x 2 x 3 x r x 2 1 m v f x 1 x 2 x 3 y c r x r 0 a r x r b r y where f e x is now the third state of the system x 3 estimated by the ekf the inclusion of a state with zero dynamics means that the random walk that takes place during the gain and propagation steps of the kalman filter is responsible for the changes in the estimated value eq 11 assumes that the time derivative of the excitation force has the form f e x g w t where g is a single term of g t in 8 and w t is a gaussian zero mean white noise signal the ekf is then modeling the excitation force simply as noise where the current value of f e x does not depend on previous estimates the choice of the process noise w t for the estimated force is crucial to success of the estimation algorithm the selection of noise is discussed in crassidis and junkins 2011 and the choice used in this work is described in section 4 3 1 the direct identification method only adds a single state to the dynamics of the system and as such is the most computationally simple identification method used in this work an additional initial condition is necessary with the addition of any state is required however precise determination of this initial condition is not necessary as it is expected that there be an initial error in the dynamics this method of identifying the excitation force does not require information on the wave climate however a sensitivity analysis of the process noise corresponding to the identified state should be performed an example where a large process noise for an identified state is able to identify a time varying viscous drag coefficient is shown in davis and fabien 2018 4 2 disturbance model estimation an alternative method of estimating the wave excitation force is to model the incident wave force as a disturbance to the wec dynamics ling 2015 ocean waves and excitation forces are typically modeled as a harmonic oscillator or the sum of a large number of sinusoids with parameters determined by a wave energy spectrum and randomized phase folley 2016 the disturbance as described by ling and batten 2015 will be modeled using a similar approach the regular wave representation of the excitation force is given as 12 f e x r h 2 f x ω e i ω t where r represents the function to extract the real part of the argument h is the peak to peak wave height and f x ω is the magnitude of the frequency domain excitation force for a given frequency ω the imaginary unit is donated by i and t is the time in seconds this excitation force can be extended to irregular waves by 13 f e x r 0 2 δ ω s ω f x ω e i ω t ϕ ω d ω where s ω is the power of the wave spectrum as a function of frequency the variable δ ω is the discrete frequency separating each frequency ω and ϕ is a vector of randomly generated phase angles in radians hsiang et al 2017 eq 13 shows an infinite integral over a range of frequencies which is typically modeled as a discrete sum folley 2016 by looking at a single frequency component of the wave excitation force a description of the excitation force dynamics can be shown as f e x s i n ω t 14 f e x ω 2 s i n ω t the differential equation describing the excitation force can be implemented in the first order system of equations by 15 x 1 x 2 f e x f e x x r x 2 1 m v f x 1 x 2 f e x y c r x r f e x ω 2 f e x a r x r b r y where f e x and f e x are now states of the dynamic system the above expression describes a system where a single excitation force signal is estimated similar to the direct identification method however 15 enforces that the estimated excitation force be a solution to the differential equation given in 14 this excitation force estimation method can be generalized to use multiple wave frequencies by using 16 x 1 x 2 f e x f e x x r x 2 1 m v f x 1 x 2 σ f e x y c r x r i f e x ω 2 f e x a r x r b r y for the dynamics the bar over the excitation force denotes a vector of disturbance forces the excitation force becomes f e x σ f e x to denote the sum of n excitation force terms that each oscillate at a different frequency and i is the n n identity matrix the term ω denotes the diagonal matrix containing each of the n frequencies corresponding to the entries of f e x the sum of each excitation force frequency allows for the excitation force to be modeled in a way that realistically describes the time derivative behavior of the wave excitation force this method however requires knowledge of the wave climate for an appropriate choice of the disturbance wave frequencies the choice of these frequencies is discussed in section 4 2 1 the initial conditions of the excitation terms should satisfy the differential equations given by 14 these initial conditions act as the terms that dictate the phase of the excitation force terms just as with the direct identification method each of the new states that are included in the dynamics are subject to a random walk that is influenced by the process noise covariance in the gain and propagation steps of the kalman filter the disturbance estimation method becomes nonlinear if any of the frequencies in ω are varied where any frequencies would then be appended to the dynamics as an extra state ling and batten 2015 for this work the frequencies remain constant the disturbance model introduces two states for every disturbance frequency that is used in the dynamics which is a significant increase in computational complexity over the direct identification method however the use of the equal energy approach when selecting wave frequencies provides an effective way to model the incident wave with only a few frequencies this enables the use of the disturbance model to more realistically describes the wave excitation force 4 2 1 equal energy approach the implementation of the disturbance method requires the choice of n frequencies to comprise the wave excitation force the typical approach to representing irregular waves uses many frequencies on the order of 10 000 sinusoids nguyen and tona 2017 however this number would be computationally impractical for implementation in a kalman filter unlike the typical time domain construction of waves the disturbance method makes use of variable magnitudes of the frequency components which are states in the model this means that fewer frequencies are required to adequately describe the time domain wave excitation force the wave frequencies used to construct an irregular wave can be found in several ways as described in orcina 2019 some examples include an arithmetic progression which selects wave components that are equally spaced in frequency and a geometric progression which selects wave components that have a constant ratio of wave frequency both of these methods typically require large numbers of waves to realistically represent an irregular wave in contrast the equal energy method can be used to realistically represent an irregular wave with relatively few frequency components and is mentioned in folley 2016 the basic premise of this method is to select wave components such that each frequency represents an equal amount of spectral energy since this energy is calculated by considering the area under the energy spectrum this method is sometimes referred to as the equal area approach fig 4 shows the wave energy spectra of the 17th run of the experimental data described in section 3 the significant wave height of the generated wave was 375 mm and the peak period was 2 37 s the vertical blue lines show the divisions between each equal energy area of the spectra and the red circles indicate the power and frequency of the components that were selected to form the disturbance equations the divisions are created by determining the area under the energy spectra and dividing this by the number of desired frequency components which was in this case 5 components to determine the area of each division a threshold for minimum power is required otherwise the very high and very low frequency components would artificially bias the selection towards frequencies with very little energy once the equal energy areas are determined a single frequency with the average power is selected from each equal energy area to provide the average power for that division this method of determining the disturbance frequencies is effective for selecting wave frequencies and initial estimations of each components magnitude while only requiring the peak period and significant wave height of the incident wave spectra 4 3 implementing the ekf in order to implement the extended kalman filter a few key considerations were required prior to successful estimation of the excitation force first and often the most difficult part of any kalman filter is determining the process noise covariance given in section 4 3 1 the other barrier to the implementation of the nonlinear equation of motion is that in typical wec models both the excitation force and incident water velocity are unknown therefore an approximation of the wave velocity is required the method used in this work for estimating the water velocity is described in section 4 3 2 4 3 1 process noise the process noise covariance is the product of g t w t that describes the error in the dynamics of the system the diagonal entries of the symmetrical matrix g t w t are variances of the noise in each state and non diagonal entries quantify the correlation between the states a typical assumption for the development of a kalman filter is to assume that no cross correlation exists between states crassidis and junkins 2011 for the equation of motion the radiation states are excepted from having a process noise variance as the error in the radiation force is included in the error for the position and velocity states davis and fabien 2018 the process noise for each state was found by simulating the response of the model to the inputs determined from experimental measurements as with the work of ling and batten 2015 bhinder et al 2015 and hsiang et al 2017 the convolution formulation of the excitation force in 7 is used to determine the wave excitation force that the float experienced during each experimental run and the water particle velocity is known from measurements of the incident wave described in section 3 the dynamics of the float are simulated using the experimental measurements and the states are compared to the measured states from bosma et al 2015 the process noise describes the error between the simulated states and the experimental states so the variance of this simulation error is calculated for each run and used as the process noise covariance in the ekf this method of estimating the process noise relies on the assumption that any full scale deployed wec will be preceded by model tests recall that we are considering various experimental runs from bosma et al 2015 and attempting to determine the wave excitation force for each run since the process noise is a variable with dimensions that will vary based on the incident wave it becomes necessary for each run to have its own process noise a typical kalman filter implementation requires a significant amount of tuning to provide effective estimation crassidis and junkins 2011 and in some cases optimization algorithms are used to identify a best choice of the process noise terms ling 2015 for this work a reasonable value of process noise for the excitation force was chosen for each separate sensitivity analysis as changes in sampling rate model complexity and measurement noise all change the robustness of the ekf to changes in the estimated state process noise 4 3 2 estimating water velocity the estimation of the water velocity of the incident wave enables the calculation of the morison drag force as the relative velocity is needed between the body and the surrounding water particles with this estimation of the velocity it becomes possible to observe the model described in section 2 using an ekf it is important to note that this nonlinear time domain model is well represented as a generic model for point absorbing wecs bhinder et al 2015 the estimation of the water particle velocity relies on a regular wave representation of the wave excitation force using 12 when simulating the excitation forces in irregular waves using 7 it is necessary to incorporate the time delay and the frequency dependent magnitude of the excitation force however in order to approximate the incident wave elevation the wave excitation force is assumed to have a small phase lag and a magnitude equal to the magnitude of f x ω p where ω p is the peak frequency of the exciting wave fig 3 shows a small wave excitation force phase lag for the frequencies corresponding to the irregular waves used in this work given in table 1 by using the linear relationship of 12 between the wave elevation and excitation force the wave elevation can be approximated by 17 y t f e x t f x ω p 2 where f e x t is the estimated excitation force and f x ω p 2 is the l2 norm euclidean norm of the excitation force at the peak frequency of the incident wave this norm is required as each entry of f x ω is an imaginary number that is used to represent the magnitude and phase of the wave excitation force note that eq 17 should only be used to calculate the wave height based on the heave forces acting on a body with a small characteristic dimension relative to the wave length the wave velocity can then be computed using a finite difference method based on the previous estimations of the water elevation this simple method allows for the full implementation of the morison drag equation with the time domain model discussed in section 2 the estimation results of the water particle velocity are given in section 5 5 estimation results the two estimation methods presented in this work were tested using the experimental data described in section 3 the discrete measurements used in the ekf are the heave position and velocity and the estimated excitation force is compared to the excitation force calculated using the non causal convolution integral formulation in 7 this convolution integral relies on knowledge of the time history of the incident wave as well as the impulse response of the buoy in the heave direction both of which are known before estimation as a result of the work in bosma et al 2015 the experimental values of water velocity is determined by taking the time derivative of the measured water surface elevation this data was recorded at the side wall of the wave tank which is the undisturbed water surface elevation that is incident to the fps each estimation run is evaluated using a goodness of fit gof computed by using the normalized mean square error nmse given by the expression 18 g o f 1 n m s e 1 s t s t 2 s t s t 2 where s t is the time domain reference signal the bar notation denotes the mean value s t is the estimated signal and the notation 2 represents the l2 norm of a vector in this work the value will be represented as a scalar less than or equal to one where g o f 1 would denote perfect estimation of the reference signal mathworks 2019 alternatively the goodness of fit can be represented as a percentage as shown in nguyen and tona 2017 in the case of this work both the incident wave velocity and excitation force are evaluated using 18 fig 5 shows the time domain estimation of the wave excitation force using both the direct identification method and the third order disturbance estimation method where third order signifies that the disturbance models is a sum of three excitation force frequencies for the incident wave the reference signal that was calculated from experimental measurements is shown in black and the results from the direct identification and the disturbance estimation methods are shown in blue and red respectively the third order disturbance estimation is shown as it provides a representative example of the performance of the disturbance estimation method while also being directly comparable to the work of ling and batten 2015 this figure shows that some of the very sharp changes in the excitation force are not captured by the estimation algorithm however it is apparent that the estimation algorithm results in a excitation force signal that represents the reference signal for this estimation run the significant wave height of the incident wave was h s 300 mm and the peak period was t p 2 37 s the gof of direct and disturbance estimations are 0 914 and 0 927 respectively in order to test the estimation algorithms in a variety of wave climates the excitation force estimation was performed for the seventeen different wave climates described in section 3 the results of which are shown in fig 7 the estimation of the incident wave water velocity is shown in fig 6 for the run 8 in table 1 the water velocity results from the direct estimation implementation and the disturbance estimation implementation are once again shown in blue and red respectively the method by which the incident water velocity is estimated is described in section 4 3 2 it is not difficult to tell by visual inspection that estimation of the water velocity is not as accurate as the estimation of the excitation force this is reflected in the goodness of fit values which for the direct and disturbance estimation methods results shown in fig 6 are 0 825 and 0 831 respectively the approximation used to describe the velocity as a function of excitation force is very simplistic and a more detailed formulation of water velocity as a function of excitation force using the relationship given by 13 could be implemented additionally a higher order finite difference scheme could be implemented however as the influence of the water velocity on dissipation forces does not drive the dynamics of the wec this simple approximation method is sufficient for this work the gof of several estimation algorithms applied to each run in table 1 are shown in fig 7 recall that both of the estimation methods being presented are run seventeen times once for each of the different wave climates being considered the results are shown in fig 7 as box and whisker plots to give an understanding of the overall performance of each method for this comparison the direct estimation method is shown compared to the disturbance estimation method of varying orders one excitation term to five excitation terms it can be seen from the figure that the performance of the disturbance estimation algorithm provides the best estimation result using three excitation force components as a result the third order disturbance estimation method will be used when analyzing the sensitivity of the estimation algorithms the estimation of the incident wave velocity is shown in fig 8 as shown in fig 8 the mean gof value tends to be roughly 10 lower than the excitation force estimation shown in fig 7 both figs 7 and 8 show a single outlier marked with a red this outlier corresponds to the first run in table 1 this high frequency wave is shown to be consistently difficult for the ekf to estimate while it is possible to tune the parameters of the kalman filter to better estimate the high frequency wave that is currently being shown as an outlier the purpose of this work is to show general trends in the estimation capabilities of the ekf methods therefore rather than producing the highest possible goodness of fit for a single wave climate this work focuses on tuning the parameters of the kalman filter to produce acceptable estimation for a wide range of wave climates it is of interest to note that this first run consisted of a wave that generated relatively small excitation forces when compared to the waves from the other runs being considered for example the excitation force of the seventeenth run has a magnitude about four times larger than the first run this means that the wave from the first run will have a much smaller effect on the dynamics of the buoy than any of the other runs considered in this work therefore while this first run consistently has the lowest gof of any of the runs being considered the waves that are consistently estimated well by the ekf have a much larger effect on the buoy dynamics as each run represents a different incident wave the gof can be plotted as a function of significant wave height shown in fig 9 and size ratio shown in fig 10 the size ratio is defined as the ratio of characteristic width of the fps and the wavelength of a deep water wave with the peak frequency of the irregular wave in fig 9 the gof is shown to not be directly influenced by the significant wave height unlike the wave frequency and size ratio the performance of the estimation algorithms tend to be worse in the cases where the wave is oscillating at a high frequency fig 10 shows that the lowest performing estimation runs occur at low frequencies since the frequency of deep water waves can be directly related to wavelength the size ratio is commonly used to determine the dominant forces for modeling purposes newman 1977 as the relative size of the float when compared to the wavelength becomes large the assumptions used in the development of the eom for this work may be called into question as the size ratio is shown to negatively impact the gof of each run in fig 10 5 1 sensitivity to sampling rate the motion data is originally recorded at a sampling frequency of 200 hz a subset of the motion data is used to test the sensitivity of the estimation algorithms to sampling rate figs 11 and 12 show the response of the direct estimation and third order disturbance estimation when the sampling rate is lowered to select a subset of the measurements an evenly spaced number of the measurements were selected and treated as the measured data points the resulting sampling frequencies are used as the control variable to determine the influence on the gof of the estimations figs 11 and 12 show that even at much lower sampling rates the effectiveness of the ekf to identify the excitation force still results in a gof greater than 0 9 the outlier corresponding to the first high frequency run shows a more significant performance degradation than the mean performance of the rest of the runs it intuitively follows that a low sampling rate would adversely affect the estimation of a high frequency wave it is important to note that while the average for the runs appears to increase at a sample rate of 2 hz the fact that an extra outlier is shown means that the overall performance for all of the runs is lower this extra outlier in both figs 11 and 12 corresponds to run 4 which has a low period for its amplitude the robustness of the estimation algorithms to a change in sampling rate shows promise for the potential of real time estimation for wec deployments 5 2 sensitivity to radiation force order the radiation force is modeled using a state space realization given by 6 that can vary in size ref ling 2015 shows a study in which the order of the radiation realization is varied and the effect on the estimator performance is evaluated using simulated wave measurements when generating the state space realization of the radiation force it is typical to use a coefficient of determination as shown in davis and fabien 2018 the fourth order state space realization used in this work was the smallest realization that satisfied the minimum coefficient of determination threshold established in davis and fabien 2018 a simple investigation into the effects that the order of the radiation force has on the excitation force estimation is described below the coefficient of determination of each of the state space realizations is given in table 2 it is shown in both figs 13 and 14 that using a first order realization for the radiation results in a significant decrease in performance note that for the second through fifth order realizations the performance of the estimator remains fairly constant however as mentioned above it was shown in davis and fabien 2018 that the fourth order radiation force is the smallest realization that is viable for identifying a missing drag force for this heaving float as a result the fourth order radiation force is used throughout the rest of the simulations in this work 5 3 sensitivity to measurement noise the experiments described in bosma et al 2015 obtained high quality position measurements by using a qualysis data acquisition system the measurement noise used in the ekfs is very small calculated from the residuals of the position measurements the standard deviation of the measurement noise for position and velocity was v 6 075 1 0 4 to investigate the sensitivity of the estimation algorithms to measurement noise an artificial zero mean gaussian noise term was added to the measurements figs 15 and 16 show the gof for the direct estimation and disturbance estimation methods respectively as artificial measurement noise is added to the experimental measurements the actual measurement noise is very small the artificial measurement noise v a is described by a noise factor that is an integer multiple of the experimental measurement noise both figs 15 and 16 show the resilience of the ekf as no appreciable performance degradation is shown until the artificial noise is several orders of magnitude larger than the measurement noise 6 conclusion this paper presents the implementation of an extended kalman filter ekf to estimate the wave excitation force of a wave energy converter wec many advanced control strategies require the wave excitation force that is acting on the wec to determine the control input however real time measurement of the wave excitation force is typically not viable for ocean deployments to provide information about the wave excitation force kalman filters are implemented as optimal state observers which are configured to estimate the wave excitation force along with the dynamics of the wec prior to this work typical implementations of the kalman filter have been restricted to linear kalman filters and have been tested with simulations rather than experimental data two different estimation methods making use of the nonlinear kalman filter are described in this work both of which are tested with experimental data from a 1 10 scale wave tank test of a floating power system which closely resembles a point absorbing float the direct estimation method relies on modeling the excitation force as a single state with no dynamics allowing for the random walk of the kalman filter to determine a statistically significant estimate of the excitation force the disturbance estimation method models the wave excitation force as a sum of sine waves with the appropriate derivatives modeled as states an equal energy method is used to determine the amplitudes and frequencies of the harmonic components the quantity of the harmonic excitation terms is varied and discussed in this work the potential based time domain integro differential equation of motion used in this work is a widely applied lumped parameter model for wec bodies this model includes a morison drag term which is nonlinear and requires knowledge of the incident wave velocity to describe the drag acting on the object the nonlinearity of this model requires the use of the ekf rather than the simpler linear kalman filter much like the wave excitation force the incident wave velocity is typically unknown in wec deployments a simple approximation of the incident wave velocity is developed and tested in this work which enables the full implementation of the nonlinear equation of motion the error between the estimated excitation force and true excitation force is evaluated using the normalized mean square error for seventeen different wave climates the sensitivity of the excitation force estimation error is evaluated for variation in the model of radiation force measurement noise sampling rate as well as wave climate both of the estimation methods discussed in this work were shown to provide good estimates of the excitation force using experimental data that would be available during a wec deployment the harmonic oscillator model of the wave excitation force utilized in the disturbance estimation method is a more realistic model of the force which results in some improvements in estimation accuracy the excitation force estimation of both methods is shown to be quite resilient to a wide range of situations this work shows that a common nonlinear lumped parameter model previously unused for wave excitation force estimation can be used to accurately estimate experimental

22087,in many advanced control strategies the wave excitation force is key to determining the control input however it is often difficult to measure the excitation force on a wave energy converter wec the use of kalman filters to estimate the wave excitation force based on readily available measurement data can potentially fill the gap between the development of wec control strategies and the data that is available two different estimation methods using an nonlinear extended kalman filter are tested on experimental wave tank data for a heaving semi submerged float the first method relies on directly including the excitation force as a state in the first order dynamics which allows the random walk of the kalman filter to identify an estimate of the excitation force the second method of estimation involves modeling the wave excitation force as a harmonic oscillator comprised of sinusoidal components both methods are evaluated for a variety of incident waves and additional sensitivity analyses are performed to investigate the susceptibility of these estimation methods to changes in the model measurement noise and sampling rate keywords wave energy converter nonlinear model excitation force estimation extended kalman filter 1 introduction wave energy converters wecs are devices that generate electricity from ocean waves some non exhaustive reviews of the widely varying devices and modeling methods for wecs can be found in day et al 2015 falnes 2007 li and yu 2012 and folley 2016 this work will focus specifically on point absorbing wave energy converters point absorbing type wecs rely on a small body when compared to the incident wavelength to be actuated primarily in a single degree of freedom to achieve power generation modern control strategies rely on state information to calculate an optimal control input as addressed in brekken 2011 and ling and batten 2015 this is possible through the use of kalman filters as optimal state observers kalman filters can also be used to estimate the wave excitation force which is necessary for many controllers ling and batten 2015 nguyen and tona 2017 even though kalman filters are commonly used to estimate the states for control systems the implementation of a kalman filter on a wec is not trivial this work addresses some of the current barriers to state observation and excitation force estimation of wave energy converters using an extended kalman filter ekf which is the nonlinear adaptation of the kalman filter the use of an ekf to determine wave excitation force using external pressure sensors is shown in abdelkhalik et al 2016 however the implementation of additional external pressure sensors may be impractical for many commercial wec applications alternatively ling and batten 2015 shows a way to use a kalman filter to estimate the exitation force by modeling the excitation force as a disturbance in the wec equations of motion the disturbance used in ling and batten 2015 describes the excitation force as a sum of sinusoids as is typical in wec modeling folley 2016 this method of estimating the wave excitation force will be referred to as the disturbance estimation method using a different approach a linear kalman filter is implemented in nguyen and tona 2017 where the excitation force is identified by including the force as a state with no dynamics and thereby allowing the random walk of the kalman filter to identify the best estimate of the state directly this methodology of implementing the kalman filter to identify the wave excitation force will be referred to as the direct estimation method the work of nguyen and tona 2017 also develops a receding horizon estimator which requires the solution of a dynamic programming problem at each time step estimation using the receding horizon method results in increased computational complexity but provides very little phase lag between the estimated and true excitation forces nguyen and tona 2017 a similar disturbance model estimation method to ling and batten 2015 is abril et al 2017 where a linear kalman filter is used on simulation data to perform an investigation into excitation force estimation and prediction the direct estimation method shown in nguyen and tona 2017 applies the same principle that is used for drag estimation in davis and fabien 2018 and unknown parameter identification in crassidis and junkins 2011 the work of faedo et al 2017 provides an overview of control algorithms many of which rely on the use of a linear kalman filter excitation force prediction is of primary interest in the overview faedo et al 2017 this work describes the implementation of an extended kalman filter that uses a nonlinear continuous time model and discrete time measurements the use of a nonlinear kalman filter enables the inclusion of the nonlinear morison drag term that has become commonly included in many lumped parameter models and wec modeling software packages bhinder et al 2015 combourieu et al 2015 the implementation and sensitivity analysis of wave excitation force estimation with an extended kalman filter on experimental data from bosma et al 2015 is described using both the direct estimation and disturbance estimation methods the considerations that need to be taken into account when implementing these two methods with a nonlinear model are given and the sensitivity of the estimation methods to various conditions are investigated the work described in this paper is differentiated from previous literature in this field by providing the following contributions the excitation force estimation is performed on experimental wave tank data the implementation of a nonlinear extended kalman filter made use of two different methods of adapting the kalman filter to estimate the excitation force the inclusion of an estimated velocity for the water surrounding the float allows for the nonlinear morison drag term to be used in the model the sensitivity of the estimation algorithm to measurement noise wave climate sampling rate radiation realization and the number of frequencies that are used to model the excitation force are studied an equal energy approach is taken to choose the wave frequencies that comprise the disturbance model of the wave excitation force this work provides insight into the implementation of a nonlinear kalman filter with experimental data for wave energy conversion reproducible methods are described to facilitate implementation of the ekf for excitation force estimation and an investigation of the limitations of the ekf is performed to help ensure the suitability of the application the purpose of this work is to enhance the performance of state observers when estimating the wave excitation force acting on wecs with the goal of enabling more effective feedback control advanced control strategies such as latching control or model predictive control mpc offer increased power production when compared to traditional wec control strategies hong et al 2014 brekken 2011 optimal power absorption is achieved when the phase of the wec velocity is properly aligned with the wave excitation force to this end latching control uses an actuator to lock a wec in a specific configuration long enough for the wec to achieve the optimal phase with the excitation force falnes 2007 model predictive control is a method that solve a series of successive small time horizon optimal control problems tom and yeung 2015 the optimal control problem is solved for a future timespan and takes into account the current wave climate when determining the optimal control input however a short prediction of incident wave elevation or wave excitation force is necessary to implement this type of controller fusco and ringwood 2012 as the wave excitation force estimation is enhanced forecasting methods can be better implemented to provide the necessary time horizons for predictive and latching control methods sections 2 and 3 describe the mathematical model and the experimental tests used in the development and implementation of the algorithms in this work respectively a description of the identification algorithms developed and the excitation force estimation results along with sensitivity analyses are given in sections 4 and 5 finally section 6 contains concluding remarks on the work presented 2 wave energy converter model the potential based time domain integro differential equation analyzed in babarit et al 2012 has become the most prolific lumped parameter model for a wec equation of motion eom however semi empirical models or simplified lumped parameter models are also possible for wecs as shown in the detailed modeling description given in davis and fabien 2018 the equation of motion of a semi submerged body in heave is given by 1 m v y f b f d f r f m f e x where the inertial force of the object is the product of the virtual mass m v and the heave acceleration y this virtual mass is the sum of the mass of the body and the infinite frequency added mass of the entrained fluid as is traditionally used in the cummins formulation cummins 1962 the terms used in 1 are defined as f b is the hyrdostatic force on the object f d is the viscous drag force f r is the radiation damping f m is the restoring force from mooring lines f e x is the wave excitation force and the displacement of the body is y the dot notation represents derivatives with respect to time for example y d y d t and y d 2 y d t 2 discussion of the simplification of a general equation of motion to the form shown in 1 can be found in davis and fabien 2018 the potential flow based force terms of 1 are developed in agreement with the cummins equation cummins 1962 which was originally developed to describe the motion of ships and is now applied to semi submerged floating bodies the work of davis and fabien 2015 shows that the nonlinear viscous drag force is significant for wave followers and the work of combourieu et al 2015 shows the necessity of the nonlinear viscous drag for modeling software as a result the viscous drag term will be included as a nonlinear term in 1 the viscous drag term is the lone nonlinear term in 1 as described in babarit et al 2012 and bhinder et al 2015 and the inertial excitation restoring and radiation forces are assumed to be linear for the following development 2 1 mooring and hydrostatic forces f m and f b the forces resulting from mooring and umbilical cables are modeled together as the product of a constant parameter and the body displacement as given by the linear relationship 2 f m k m u y where k m u is lumped linear spring constant describing the forces acting on the body by the mooring lines and umbilical cable and y is the displacement from the static equilibrium point by modeling the response of the body from the equilibrium position as with the hydrostatic restoring force only a linear relationship is needed to determine the vertical force contribution of the cables as a function of heave position the constant can be determined experimentally using load cells and displacement measurements described in section 3 the hydrostatic restoring force is determined by 3 f b ρ g a y where a is the projected area of the submerged volume at the calm water surface ρ is the density g is the gravitational acceleration constant and y is the displacement from the static equilibrium it is important to note that 3 assumes that a constant area is being submerged 2 2 drag force f d the viscous drag is modeled using a quadratic morison drag form chakrabarti 2005 and zurkinden et al 2014 the drag in the heave direction is given by 4 f d 1 2 ρ a p c d v v b y where v is the relative velocity between the object and the water particles surrounding it the density of the fluid is given by ρ and a p is the projected area of the object in the heave direction a signed velocity square term is computed by taking the product of velocity v and the absolute value of the velocity v finally the drag coefficient is given by c d the relative velocity v ensures that the drag force is not over predicted if the velocity of the ocean wave was neglected then a large viscous drag force would be calculated any time the body is oscillating in phase with the incident wave a case where the drag should be small since there would be very little motion between the body and the impinging water particles an approach to estimating the vertical water velocity can be found in section 4 3 2 a discussion on the treatment of the viscous drag force as well as an identification method can be found in davis and fabien 2018 a small linear damping force b y is included to compensate for the fluid shear forces acting on the body and linear damping in the mooring lines the coefficient b is based on the experimental response of the body at low velocities 2 3 radiation force f r the force acting on the wec that results from radiated waves is calculated in the time domain through the use of the convolution integral as illustrated in cummins 1962 a state space realization of the convolution integral is created as an efficient method of computing the radiation force the state space representation of the radiation force can be formed as 5 x r t a r x r t b r y t 6 f r c r x r t where x r is the state variable of the realization the state matrices a r b r and c r are a non unique linear realization of the convolution integral and are generated from the impulse response function kristiansen et al 2005 of the system a more detailed description of the fourier transform inversion and computational considerations of describing the radiation force as a state space system is given in davis and fabien 2018 2 4 excitation force f e x the wave excitation force can be calculated using the excitation force impulse response function irf f i r f t and the wave surface elevation y w using the convolution integral 7 f e x t f i r f τ y w t τ d τ this convolution is used to compute the true value of the excitation force for this work as shown in ling and batten 2015 and falnes 2002 the time range of the numerical integration is truncated to be longer than the active response of the excitation irf which is determined by applying the inverse fourier transform on the frequency dependant excitation force calculated from a bem falnes 2002 3 available data experimental data was made available by the oregon state university northwest national marine renewable energy center s marine and hydrokinetics open data project nnmrec 2017 the data set that is used in this work was a physical model test of a 1 10 scale floating power system at the coast lab at plymouth university bosma et al 2015 the deep water tests described in bosma et al 2015 is used to determine the parameters in the equations of motion the mooring study described in bosma et al 2015 used a wave tank to compare several mooring configurations of two bodies in water of these two bodies the scaled floating power system fps is analyzed in this current work as it provides a very similar geometry to the float of a point absorbing wec the fps is shown in fig 1 in the wave tank prior to wave generation for this work a subset of experimental runs were chosen seventeen different panchromatic runs using an elastic o rings as moorings are used to test the kalman filter estimation algorithm in section 5 these moorings act as springs and allow for displacement in all six degrees of freedom the work of bosma et al 2015 shows experimentally that a resonance period for the fps exists between 2 5 and 2 8 s table 1 shows the significant wave height h s the peak period t p the zero crossing period t z and the bandwidth b of the incident wave spectra each data set had roughly six hundred seconds of data collected incident wave elevation and mooring line forces were measured at 128 hz and motion data was recorded at a sampling frequency of 200 hz irregular waves were generated using the bretshneider spectrum 3 1 reproducing numerical work detailed descriptions of the experiments along with wave tank schematics and dimensioned drawings can be found in the marine and hydrokinentics open data project nnmrec 2017 key parameters used in the wec models not found in bosma et al 2015 or nnmrec 2017 can be found in davis and fabien 2018 frequency dependent terms such as added mass radiation damping and wave excitation are calculated using the bem code nemoh babarit et al 2017 fig 2 shows the radiation damping and added mass as a function of angular frequency for the fps the magnitude and phase of the wave excitation force on the fps is shown as a function of angular frequency in fig 3 the scripts used for this paper to execute nemoh and all other figures will be made available on github davis 2019 4 continuous discrete extended kalman filter the kalman filter incorporates measured outputs a model and gaussian error description to determine a statistically significant estimate of the state dynamics a nonlinear continuous time model with discrete time experimental data points can be observed using a continuous discrete extended kalman filter the ekf is a nonlinear adaptation of the kalman filter which observes a dynamic system in which zero mean gaussian white noise is assumed in both the dynamics and measurement the model that is observed by the extended kalman filter is described by 8 x t f x t u t t g t w t 9 y t h x t t v t where f is the nonlinear state dynamics h is the nonlinear output function g t is a vector that describes the noise of each state w t is zero mean gaussian white noise with a variance q t and v t is zero mean gaussian white noise with a variance of r t the tilde symbol modifying the output y represents that this is an experimentally measured quantity the accuracy of the kalman filter relies on knowledge of the process and measurement noise terms correct quantification of the process noise is essential for the ekf to function effectively for discussions concerning the determination of the process noise covariance see crassidis and junkins 2011 and mehra 1970 and section 4 3 1 since the ekf deals with nonlinear systems that must be integrated to determine state dynamics reasonable initial conditions must be used to ensure filter stability crassidis and junkins 2011 the kalman filter will iterate through the gain update and propagate steps for each discrete time in order to estimate the states of the system the gain step calculates a matrix of gains that is used to correct a previous step s estimates based on the covariance of each state the update step uses the calculated gain to adjust the covariance of each state and estimated value based on the difference between estimated and measured states finally the propagation step calculates the covariance and state estimates of the next time step details on the theory of the continuous discrete ekf can be found in crassidis and junkins 2011 and the implementation of the algorithm on a wec application can be found in davis and fabien 2018 for this implementation of the ekf the joseph stabilized form of the covariance update equation is used and the symmetry of the covariance matrix is enforced by taking the element wise average of the covariance and its transpose at each step in order to use the kalman filter for estimation the model must be modified to provide the estimated parameter as a function of the observed states as described below 4 1 direct identification estimation to directly identify a force or parameter using the ekf the variable in question is appended as an extra state with no dynamics each state in the dynamics of a kalman filter undergoes a random walk to determine the best estimate of the state variable at each time step crassidis and junkins 2011 the nonlinear dynamics in 8 described in section 2 when reduced to a first order system is 10 x 1 x 2 x r x 2 1 m v f x 1 x 2 f e x y c r x r a r x r b r y where x r is a vector of radiation states x 1 and x 2 are the first order variables for position and velocity respectively and both f e x and y are inputs to the system representing wave excitation force and water velocity respectively the estimated wave excitation force can be used to provide a functional estimate of the water velocity surrounding the wec as described in section 4 3 2 the inclusion of f e x as an estimated force necessitates the inclusion of another state in the dynamics as 11 x 1 x 2 x 3 x r x 2 1 m v f x 1 x 2 x 3 y c r x r 0 a r x r b r y where f e x is now the third state of the system x 3 estimated by the ekf the inclusion of a state with zero dynamics means that the random walk that takes place during the gain and propagation steps of the kalman filter is responsible for the changes in the estimated value eq 11 assumes that the time derivative of the excitation force has the form f e x g w t where g is a single term of g t in 8 and w t is a gaussian zero mean white noise signal the ekf is then modeling the excitation force simply as noise where the current value of f e x does not depend on previous estimates the choice of the process noise w t for the estimated force is crucial to success of the estimation algorithm the selection of noise is discussed in crassidis and junkins 2011 and the choice used in this work is described in section 4 3 1 the direct identification method only adds a single state to the dynamics of the system and as such is the most computationally simple identification method used in this work an additional initial condition is necessary with the addition of any state is required however precise determination of this initial condition is not necessary as it is expected that there be an initial error in the dynamics this method of identifying the excitation force does not require information on the wave climate however a sensitivity analysis of the process noise corresponding to the identified state should be performed an example where a large process noise for an identified state is able to identify a time varying viscous drag coefficient is shown in davis and fabien 2018 4 2 disturbance model estimation an alternative method of estimating the wave excitation force is to model the incident wave force as a disturbance to the wec dynamics ling 2015 ocean waves and excitation forces are typically modeled as a harmonic oscillator or the sum of a large number of sinusoids with parameters determined by a wave energy spectrum and randomized phase folley 2016 the disturbance as described by ling and batten 2015 will be modeled using a similar approach the regular wave representation of the excitation force is given as 12 f e x r h 2 f x ω e i ω t where r represents the function to extract the real part of the argument h is the peak to peak wave height and f x ω is the magnitude of the frequency domain excitation force for a given frequency ω the imaginary unit is donated by i and t is the time in seconds this excitation force can be extended to irregular waves by 13 f e x r 0 2 δ ω s ω f x ω e i ω t ϕ ω d ω where s ω is the power of the wave spectrum as a function of frequency the variable δ ω is the discrete frequency separating each frequency ω and ϕ is a vector of randomly generated phase angles in radians hsiang et al 2017 eq 13 shows an infinite integral over a range of frequencies which is typically modeled as a discrete sum folley 2016 by looking at a single frequency component of the wave excitation force a description of the excitation force dynamics can be shown as f e x s i n ω t 14 f e x ω 2 s i n ω t the differential equation describing the excitation force can be implemented in the first order system of equations by 15 x 1 x 2 f e x f e x x r x 2 1 m v f x 1 x 2 f e x y c r x r f e x ω 2 f e x a r x r b r y where f e x and f e x are now states of the dynamic system the above expression describes a system where a single excitation force signal is estimated similar to the direct identification method however 15 enforces that the estimated excitation force be a solution to the differential equation given in 14 this excitation force estimation method can be generalized to use multiple wave frequencies by using 16 x 1 x 2 f e x f e x x r x 2 1 m v f x 1 x 2 σ f e x y c r x r i f e x ω 2 f e x a r x r b r y for the dynamics the bar over the excitation force denotes a vector of disturbance forces the excitation force becomes f e x σ f e x to denote the sum of n excitation force terms that each oscillate at a different frequency and i is the n n identity matrix the term ω denotes the diagonal matrix containing each of the n frequencies corresponding to the entries of f e x the sum of each excitation force frequency allows for the excitation force to be modeled in a way that realistically describes the time derivative behavior of the wave excitation force this method however requires knowledge of the wave climate for an appropriate choice of the disturbance wave frequencies the choice of these frequencies is discussed in section 4 2 1 the initial conditions of the excitation terms should satisfy the differential equations given by 14 these initial conditions act as the terms that dictate the phase of the excitation force terms just as with the direct identification method each of the new states that are included in the dynamics are subject to a random walk that is influenced by the process noise covariance in the gain and propagation steps of the kalman filter the disturbance estimation method becomes nonlinear if any of the frequencies in ω are varied where any frequencies would then be appended to the dynamics as an extra state ling and batten 2015 for this work the frequencies remain constant the disturbance model introduces two states for every disturbance frequency that is used in the dynamics which is a significant increase in computational complexity over the direct identification method however the use of the equal energy approach when selecting wave frequencies provides an effective way to model the incident wave with only a few frequencies this enables the use of the disturbance model to more realistically describes the wave excitation force 4 2 1 equal energy approach the implementation of the disturbance method requires the choice of n frequencies to comprise the wave excitation force the typical approach to representing irregular waves uses many frequencies on the order of 10 000 sinusoids nguyen and tona 2017 however this number would be computationally impractical for implementation in a kalman filter unlike the typical time domain construction of waves the disturbance method makes use of variable magnitudes of the frequency components which are states in the model this means that fewer frequencies are required to adequately describe the time domain wave excitation force the wave frequencies used to construct an irregular wave can be found in several ways as described in orcina 2019 some examples include an arithmetic progression which selects wave components that are equally spaced in frequency and a geometric progression which selects wave components that have a constant ratio of wave frequency both of these methods typically require large numbers of waves to realistically represent an irregular wave in contrast the equal energy method can be used to realistically represent an irregular wave with relatively few frequency components and is mentioned in folley 2016 the basic premise of this method is to select wave components such that each frequency represents an equal amount of spectral energy since this energy is calculated by considering the area under the energy spectrum this method is sometimes referred to as the equal area approach fig 4 shows the wave energy spectra of the 17th run of the experimental data described in section 3 the significant wave height of the generated wave was 375 mm and the peak period was 2 37 s the vertical blue lines show the divisions between each equal energy area of the spectra and the red circles indicate the power and frequency of the components that were selected to form the disturbance equations the divisions are created by determining the area under the energy spectra and dividing this by the number of desired frequency components which was in this case 5 components to determine the area of each division a threshold for minimum power is required otherwise the very high and very low frequency components would artificially bias the selection towards frequencies with very little energy once the equal energy areas are determined a single frequency with the average power is selected from each equal energy area to provide the average power for that division this method of determining the disturbance frequencies is effective for selecting wave frequencies and initial estimations of each components magnitude while only requiring the peak period and significant wave height of the incident wave spectra 4 3 implementing the ekf in order to implement the extended kalman filter a few key considerations were required prior to successful estimation of the excitation force first and often the most difficult part of any kalman filter is determining the process noise covariance given in section 4 3 1 the other barrier to the implementation of the nonlinear equation of motion is that in typical wec models both the excitation force and incident water velocity are unknown therefore an approximation of the wave velocity is required the method used in this work for estimating the water velocity is described in section 4 3 2 4 3 1 process noise the process noise covariance is the product of g t w t that describes the error in the dynamics of the system the diagonal entries of the symmetrical matrix g t w t are variances of the noise in each state and non diagonal entries quantify the correlation between the states a typical assumption for the development of a kalman filter is to assume that no cross correlation exists between states crassidis and junkins 2011 for the equation of motion the radiation states are excepted from having a process noise variance as the error in the radiation force is included in the error for the position and velocity states davis and fabien 2018 the process noise for each state was found by simulating the response of the model to the inputs determined from experimental measurements as with the work of ling and batten 2015 bhinder et al 2015 and hsiang et al 2017 the convolution formulation of the excitation force in 7 is used to determine the wave excitation force that the float experienced during each experimental run and the water particle velocity is known from measurements of the incident wave described in section 3 the dynamics of the float are simulated using the experimental measurements and the states are compared to the measured states from bosma et al 2015 the process noise describes the error between the simulated states and the experimental states so the variance of this simulation error is calculated for each run and used as the process noise covariance in the ekf this method of estimating the process noise relies on the assumption that any full scale deployed wec will be preceded by model tests recall that we are considering various experimental runs from bosma et al 2015 and attempting to determine the wave excitation force for each run since the process noise is a variable with dimensions that will vary based on the incident wave it becomes necessary for each run to have its own process noise a typical kalman filter implementation requires a significant amount of tuning to provide effective estimation crassidis and junkins 2011 and in some cases optimization algorithms are used to identify a best choice of the process noise terms ling 2015 for this work a reasonable value of process noise for the excitation force was chosen for each separate sensitivity analysis as changes in sampling rate model complexity and measurement noise all change the robustness of the ekf to changes in the estimated state process noise 4 3 2 estimating water velocity the estimation of the water velocity of the incident wave enables the calculation of the morison drag force as the relative velocity is needed between the body and the surrounding water particles with this estimation of the velocity it becomes possible to observe the model described in section 2 using an ekf it is important to note that this nonlinear time domain model is well represented as a generic model for point absorbing wecs bhinder et al 2015 the estimation of the water particle velocity relies on a regular wave representation of the wave excitation force using 12 when simulating the excitation forces in irregular waves using 7 it is necessary to incorporate the time delay and the frequency dependent magnitude of the excitation force however in order to approximate the incident wave elevation the wave excitation force is assumed to have a small phase lag and a magnitude equal to the magnitude of f x ω p where ω p is the peak frequency of the exciting wave fig 3 shows a small wave excitation force phase lag for the frequencies corresponding to the irregular waves used in this work given in table 1 by using the linear relationship of 12 between the wave elevation and excitation force the wave elevation can be approximated by 17 y t f e x t f x ω p 2 where f e x t is the estimated excitation force and f x ω p 2 is the l2 norm euclidean norm of the excitation force at the peak frequency of the incident wave this norm is required as each entry of f x ω is an imaginary number that is used to represent the magnitude and phase of the wave excitation force note that eq 17 should only be used to calculate the wave height based on the heave forces acting on a body with a small characteristic dimension relative to the wave length the wave velocity can then be computed using a finite difference method based on the previous estimations of the water elevation this simple method allows for the full implementation of the morison drag equation with the time domain model discussed in section 2 the estimation results of the water particle velocity are given in section 5 5 estimation results the two estimation methods presented in this work were tested using the experimental data described in section 3 the discrete measurements used in the ekf are the heave position and velocity and the estimated excitation force is compared to the excitation force calculated using the non causal convolution integral formulation in 7 this convolution integral relies on knowledge of the time history of the incident wave as well as the impulse response of the buoy in the heave direction both of which are known before estimation as a result of the work in bosma et al 2015 the experimental values of water velocity is determined by taking the time derivative of the measured water surface elevation this data was recorded at the side wall of the wave tank which is the undisturbed water surface elevation that is incident to the fps each estimation run is evaluated using a goodness of fit gof computed by using the normalized mean square error nmse given by the expression 18 g o f 1 n m s e 1 s t s t 2 s t s t 2 where s t is the time domain reference signal the bar notation denotes the mean value s t is the estimated signal and the notation 2 represents the l2 norm of a vector in this work the value will be represented as a scalar less than or equal to one where g o f 1 would denote perfect estimation of the reference signal mathworks 2019 alternatively the goodness of fit can be represented as a percentage as shown in nguyen and tona 2017 in the case of this work both the incident wave velocity and excitation force are evaluated using 18 fig 5 shows the time domain estimation of the wave excitation force using both the direct identification method and the third order disturbance estimation method where third order signifies that the disturbance models is a sum of three excitation force frequencies for the incident wave the reference signal that was calculated from experimental measurements is shown in black and the results from the direct identification and the disturbance estimation methods are shown in blue and red respectively the third order disturbance estimation is shown as it provides a representative example of the performance of the disturbance estimation method while also being directly comparable to the work of ling and batten 2015 this figure shows that some of the very sharp changes in the excitation force are not captured by the estimation algorithm however it is apparent that the estimation algorithm results in a excitation force signal that represents the reference signal for this estimation run the significant wave height of the incident wave was h s 300 mm and the peak period was t p 2 37 s the gof of direct and disturbance estimations are 0 914 and 0 927 respectively in order to test the estimation algorithms in a variety of wave climates the excitation force estimation was performed for the seventeen different wave climates described in section 3 the results of which are shown in fig 7 the estimation of the incident wave water velocity is shown in fig 6 for the run 8 in table 1 the water velocity results from the direct estimation implementation and the disturbance estimation implementation are once again shown in blue and red respectively the method by which the incident water velocity is estimated is described in section 4 3 2 it is not difficult to tell by visual inspection that estimation of the water velocity is not as accurate as the estimation of the excitation force this is reflected in the goodness of fit values which for the direct and disturbance estimation methods results shown in fig 6 are 0 825 and 0 831 respectively the approximation used to describe the velocity as a function of excitation force is very simplistic and a more detailed formulation of water velocity as a function of excitation force using the relationship given by 13 could be implemented additionally a higher order finite difference scheme could be implemented however as the influence of the water velocity on dissipation forces does not drive the dynamics of the wec this simple approximation method is sufficient for this work the gof of several estimation algorithms applied to each run in table 1 are shown in fig 7 recall that both of the estimation methods being presented are run seventeen times once for each of the different wave climates being considered the results are shown in fig 7 as box and whisker plots to give an understanding of the overall performance of each method for this comparison the direct estimation method is shown compared to the disturbance estimation method of varying orders one excitation term to five excitation terms it can be seen from the figure that the performance of the disturbance estimation algorithm provides the best estimation result using three excitation force components as a result the third order disturbance estimation method will be used when analyzing the sensitivity of the estimation algorithms the estimation of the incident wave velocity is shown in fig 8 as shown in fig 8 the mean gof value tends to be roughly 10 lower than the excitation force estimation shown in fig 7 both figs 7 and 8 show a single outlier marked with a red this outlier corresponds to the first run in table 1 this high frequency wave is shown to be consistently difficult for the ekf to estimate while it is possible to tune the parameters of the kalman filter to better estimate the high frequency wave that is currently being shown as an outlier the purpose of this work is to show general trends in the estimation capabilities of the ekf methods therefore rather than producing the highest possible goodness of fit for a single wave climate this work focuses on tuning the parameters of the kalman filter to produce acceptable estimation for a wide range of wave climates it is of interest to note that this first run consisted of a wave that generated relatively small excitation forces when compared to the waves from the other runs being considered for example the excitation force of the seventeenth run has a magnitude about four times larger than the first run this means that the wave from the first run will have a much smaller effect on the dynamics of the buoy than any of the other runs considered in this work therefore while this first run consistently has the lowest gof of any of the runs being considered the waves that are consistently estimated well by the ekf have a much larger effect on the buoy dynamics as each run represents a different incident wave the gof can be plotted as a function of significant wave height shown in fig 9 and size ratio shown in fig 10 the size ratio is defined as the ratio of characteristic width of the fps and the wavelength of a deep water wave with the peak frequency of the irregular wave in fig 9 the gof is shown to not be directly influenced by the significant wave height unlike the wave frequency and size ratio the performance of the estimation algorithms tend to be worse in the cases where the wave is oscillating at a high frequency fig 10 shows that the lowest performing estimation runs occur at low frequencies since the frequency of deep water waves can be directly related to wavelength the size ratio is commonly used to determine the dominant forces for modeling purposes newman 1977 as the relative size of the float when compared to the wavelength becomes large the assumptions used in the development of the eom for this work may be called into question as the size ratio is shown to negatively impact the gof of each run in fig 10 5 1 sensitivity to sampling rate the motion data is originally recorded at a sampling frequency of 200 hz a subset of the motion data is used to test the sensitivity of the estimation algorithms to sampling rate figs 11 and 12 show the response of the direct estimation and third order disturbance estimation when the sampling rate is lowered to select a subset of the measurements an evenly spaced number of the measurements were selected and treated as the measured data points the resulting sampling frequencies are used as the control variable to determine the influence on the gof of the estimations figs 11 and 12 show that even at much lower sampling rates the effectiveness of the ekf to identify the excitation force still results in a gof greater than 0 9 the outlier corresponding to the first high frequency run shows a more significant performance degradation than the mean performance of the rest of the runs it intuitively follows that a low sampling rate would adversely affect the estimation of a high frequency wave it is important to note that while the average for the runs appears to increase at a sample rate of 2 hz the fact that an extra outlier is shown means that the overall performance for all of the runs is lower this extra outlier in both figs 11 and 12 corresponds to run 4 which has a low period for its amplitude the robustness of the estimation algorithms to a change in sampling rate shows promise for the potential of real time estimation for wec deployments 5 2 sensitivity to radiation force order the radiation force is modeled using a state space realization given by 6 that can vary in size ref ling 2015 shows a study in which the order of the radiation realization is varied and the effect on the estimator performance is evaluated using simulated wave measurements when generating the state space realization of the radiation force it is typical to use a coefficient of determination as shown in davis and fabien 2018 the fourth order state space realization used in this work was the smallest realization that satisfied the minimum coefficient of determination threshold established in davis and fabien 2018 a simple investigation into the effects that the order of the radiation force has on the excitation force estimation is described below the coefficient of determination of each of the state space realizations is given in table 2 it is shown in both figs 13 and 14 that using a first order realization for the radiation results in a significant decrease in performance note that for the second through fifth order realizations the performance of the estimator remains fairly constant however as mentioned above it was shown in davis and fabien 2018 that the fourth order radiation force is the smallest realization that is viable for identifying a missing drag force for this heaving float as a result the fourth order radiation force is used throughout the rest of the simulations in this work 5 3 sensitivity to measurement noise the experiments described in bosma et al 2015 obtained high quality position measurements by using a qualysis data acquisition system the measurement noise used in the ekfs is very small calculated from the residuals of the position measurements the standard deviation of the measurement noise for position and velocity was v 6 075 1 0 4 to investigate the sensitivity of the estimation algorithms to measurement noise an artificial zero mean gaussian noise term was added to the measurements figs 15 and 16 show the gof for the direct estimation and disturbance estimation methods respectively as artificial measurement noise is added to the experimental measurements the actual measurement noise is very small the artificial measurement noise v a is described by a noise factor that is an integer multiple of the experimental measurement noise both figs 15 and 16 show the resilience of the ekf as no appreciable performance degradation is shown until the artificial noise is several orders of magnitude larger than the measurement noise 6 conclusion this paper presents the implementation of an extended kalman filter ekf to estimate the wave excitation force of a wave energy converter wec many advanced control strategies require the wave excitation force that is acting on the wec to determine the control input however real time measurement of the wave excitation force is typically not viable for ocean deployments to provide information about the wave excitation force kalman filters are implemented as optimal state observers which are configured to estimate the wave excitation force along with the dynamics of the wec prior to this work typical implementations of the kalman filter have been restricted to linear kalman filters and have been tested with simulations rather than experimental data two different estimation methods making use of the nonlinear kalman filter are described in this work both of which are tested with experimental data from a 1 10 scale wave tank test of a floating power system which closely resembles a point absorbing float the direct estimation method relies on modeling the excitation force as a single state with no dynamics allowing for the random walk of the kalman filter to determine a statistically significant estimate of the excitation force the disturbance estimation method models the wave excitation force as a sum of sine waves with the appropriate derivatives modeled as states an equal energy method is used to determine the amplitudes and frequencies of the harmonic components the quantity of the harmonic excitation terms is varied and discussed in this work the potential based time domain integro differential equation of motion used in this work is a widely applied lumped parameter model for wec bodies this model includes a morison drag term which is nonlinear and requires knowledge of the incident wave velocity to describe the drag acting on the object the nonlinearity of this model requires the use of the ekf rather than the simpler linear kalman filter much like the wave excitation force the incident wave velocity is typically unknown in wec deployments a simple approximation of the incident wave velocity is developed and tested in this work which enables the full implementation of the nonlinear equation of motion the error between the estimated excitation force and true excitation force is evaluated using the normalized mean square error for seventeen different wave climates the sensitivity of the excitation force estimation error is evaluated for variation in the model of radiation force measurement noise sampling rate as well as wave climate both of the estimation methods discussed in this work were shown to provide good estimates of the excitation force using experimental data that would be available during a wec deployment the harmonic oscillator model of the wave excitation force utilized in the disturbance estimation method is a more realistic model of the force which results in some improvements in estimation accuracy the excitation force estimation of both methods is shown to be quite resilient to a wide range of situations this work shows that a common nonlinear lumped parameter model previously unused for wave excitation force estimation can be used to accurately estimate experimental

22088,dissolved oxygen do concentration is a significant indicator of marine environment and ecology and hypoxia occurs frequently in deeper seawater we present a new wave energy utilization device to transport superficial oxygen rich water to deeper hypoxic zones a series of experiments were conducted and a simple 3 d cfd model was developed to investigate the hydrodynamic behavior and oxygen transfer performance of the device for waves with increases in wave heights or periods the response amplitude ra of heaving components and the average flow rate in inlet tube increased however ra decreased when distance between the entrance of inlet tube and the flume bottom increased for relatively small wave period scenarios relative ra increased with increasing wave steepness however for relatively large wave period scenarios it increased to a peak and then decreased with increasing wave steepness with the increase in equivalent damping coefficient or buoy relative height relative ra of heaving buoy decreased the oxygen transfer coefficient on the wave surface increased with increasing wave steepness the do concentrations and oxygen transfer coefficients were higher in the scenarios with the device than in those without the device indicating that a high oxygen transfer efficiency could be accomplished using the device keywords waves heaving buoy water transport oxygen transfer coefficient 1 introduction dissolved oxygen do concentration plays a significant role in the seawater environment and ecology in recent decades coastal hypoxia do concentration 2 0 mg l or approximately 30 saturation have spread globally mainly due to coastal eutrophication and vertical water column stratification it poses a severe threat to the normal growth and productive capacity of living organisms in the ecosystem and even triggers mortality events ram et al 2014 diaz and rosenberg 2008 pointed out that the number of global dead zones of hypoxia started to approximately double every ten years since the 1960s and 400 plus dead zone sites have been reported affecting a total area of more than 245 000 km2 as of 2008 unfortunately vast majority of the aforementioned sites continues to worsen in spite of remediation efforts to reduce organic and nutrient loadings and only a small proportion of 4 have shown improvement trends of do concentration in the bottom water diaz and rosenberg 2008 caballero alfonso et al 2015 in terms of spatial distribution do concentration in the bottom water is usually lower than that in the surface water due to non ventilation and vertical stratification strengthened by the global warming tendency scully 2010 bertone et al 2015 gold et al 2017 in the case of the trieste gulf the adriatic sea in august 2016 the surface and 15 m depth do concentrations were measured as about 230 μmol l and 100 μmol l respectively at a northern station kralj et al 2019 the surface and 20 m depth do concentrations were measured as 263 μmol kg and 81 μmol kg respectively in a south depression basin at bohai sea china during august 2014 zhao et al 2017 the do concentrations were measured as more than 6 3 mg l for the surface water and below 2 6 mg l at 20 m depth location in the east china sea in august 2013 in addition a sharp density gradient was observed under the mixed layer to restrict vertical re aeration across the strong pycnocline illustrating that the density increase and stratification in deeper water contribute negatively to transporting superficial oxygen rich water to bottom hypoxic zones chen et al 2007 vertical mixing in the water column and circulation play significant roles in enhancing do concentration in the bottom water diaz and rosenberg 2008 recently considerable attention has been devoted to analyzing the effect of natural processes such as wind waves tides and even river discharge on hypoxia pu et al 2016 basdurak et al 2013 shu et al 2011 paskyabi and fer 2012 duan et al 2012 however little research has been conducted on strengthening vertical mixing and circulation in a water body using an artificial device stommel et al 1956 first proposed the concept of a perpetual salt fountain created using long pipes to pump nutrient rich deep water to the surface for fishing and farming applications vershinskiy et al 1987 evaluated the theoretical performance of using a wave pump for artificial upwelling and its capacity and efficiency were explored based on wave amplitude and frequency and its dimensions liu and jin 1995 numerically investigated the hydrodynamic performance of a wave driven artificial upwelling device and evaluated the upwelling flow rate for regular and random incident waves fan et al 2015 numerically examined the flow and nutrient transport of a deep ocean water plume in the south china sea using an artificial upwelling device pan et al 2016 reviewed current progress in the artificial upwelling system and its potential environmental effects and the air lift concept of artificial upwelling draws particular attention with the aim of increasing the concentration of do in bottom water a new floating device called oxyflux was proposed and experimentally and numerically assessed in terms of its dynamic response and pumping capacity for various wave parameters considering the nonlinear effects on its dynamic behavior antonini et al 2015 2016 margheritini and claeson 2011 field tested their wave energized baltic aeration pump off the stockholm coast in summer 2010 to demonstrate the technical and financial feasibility of attempting to counteract hypoxia and anoxia in the deep water layers in addition the floating body motion in waves has attracted a great deal of attention in recent years nallayarasu and saravanapriya 2013a 2013b nallayarasu and bairathi 2014 and nallayarasu et al 2014 carried out a series of experimental numerical and theoretical investigations on the motion response of spar in regular and random waves and the effect of spar hulls shape was analyzed to obtain the motion response characteristics in this study a new wave energy utilization device is presented to transport the superficial oxygen rich water

device used in this study is designed to counter hypoxia or anoxia in deep water it is driven by natural waves rather than electricity or fuel consequently it has a cost advantage and is environmentally friendly the device consists of two sets of parts i e heaving and immovable components as shown in fig 1 the heaving components consist of a hollow cylinder a connecting rod with cylindrical shape and a circular piston the hollow cylinder is 0 30 m in diameter and 0 12 m in height to absorb incident wave energy as a heaving buoy the connecting rod is 0 02 m in diameter and 0 48 m in height and the circular piston is 0 060 m in diameter and 0 002 m in height to pull in or extrude oxygen rich upper water a venthole is opened vertically through the hollow cylinder the air pressure among the piston top inner wall of hydraulic cylinder and connecting rod approaches the atmospheric value it varies little with the motion of heaving components without the air sucking and press effect and the mechanical energy loss of the device reduces to improve the heaving performance as a result the overall average density of the hollow cylinder is 295 kg m3 the immovable components consist of a circular gravity base 0 50 m in diameter and 0 01 m in height at the bottom to assure stability under the wave effect three cylindrical slide bars each 0 01 m in diameter and 1 00 m in height to control the vertical motion of the heaving components and a hydraulic cylinder 0 060 m in inner diameter 0 063 m in outer diameter and 0 480 m in height to store the oxygen rich water all attached to two circular supporting frames the hydraulic cylinder has an open top and closed bottom there are two circular holes 0 01 m in diameter at the bottom one connects to an inlet tube 0 01 m in diameter through a one way inlet valve to pull in oxygen rich surface water and the other connects to an outlet tube 0 01 m in diameter through a one way outlet valve to release the oxygen rich water into the deep hypoxic zone the adhesive tapes are used to tightly fix the inlet and outlet tubes on the side wall of the flume with desired heights and the motions of inlet and outlet tubes are not observed in the experiments particular attention was paid to the diameter of the piston given the inner diameter of hydraulic cylinder this is important because an oversized piston can cause excessive friction with the inner wall of the hydraulic cylinder reducing the efficiency of water transport and potentially rendering a device unworkable while an undersized piston can create large gap between the piston and inner wall of the hydraulic cylinder causing more water to flow through the gap and decreasing water transport efficiency in the experiments the exterior margin of piston is made of rubber material to slightly deform with the friction effect and the mineral lubricating oil is used to reduce the friction the wear and the water leakage between piston and inner wall of hydraulic cylinder the working principle of the device is simple when the wave surface ascends the heaving components move upward along the three slide bars under the actions of buoyancy and wave excitation force as the pressure between the bottom of the hydraulic cylinder and the piston decreases the surface oxygen rich water is pulled into the hydraulic cylinder through the inlet tube and valve due to the pressure difference and then stored when the wave surface descends the heaving components move downward along the three slide bars under the action of gravity increasing the pressure between the hydraulic cylinder bottom and the piston and the inside oxygen rich water is extruded into the deep hypoxic zone through the outlet tube and valve 2 2 experimental setup and scenarios to examine the hydrodynamic characteristics and surface oxygen rich water transport efficiency a series of experiments were conducted in a wave flume with 25 0 m length 1 0 m width and 1 2 m height at the hydrodynamic laboratory of ocean university of china fig 2 shows the experimental setup at one end of the wave flume a vertical piston type wave paddle was used to generate the regular and irregular waves and a large quantity of porous material was installed at the other end to absorb the waves as well as to avoid unwanted wave reflection the device was fixed 13 m from the wave generation end and two iron bricks were placed at the gravity base to ensure the stability of immovable components the vertical distance between the entrance of the inlet tube and the flume bottom h in was set as 0 15 m and 0 45 m respectively and the vertical distance between the exit of the outlet tube and the flume bottom h out was fixed as 0 02 m a flowmeter was attached to the inlet tube to measure the flow process a displacement sensor was fixed on the top portion of the heaving components to measure their displacement history and their heaving velocity was calculated using the displacement history three wave gauges with a sampling frequency of 50 hz were installed along the longitudinal axis of the flume three jpb 607a do probes 1 2 and 3 made in shanghai inesa scientific instrument co ltd with the accuracy of 0 0001 kg m3 were calibrated using the winkler technique and then placed 0 50 m 0 25 m and 0 02 m from the flume bottom respectively to measure the do concentration c in the surface middle and bottom water layer yakushev et al 2012 the water temperature was also measured varying from 25 8 c to 26 2 c the still water depth d was kept as a constant 0 60 m for all the experimental scenarios for the regular waves the incident wave height h ranged from 0 08 m to 0 16 m at the step of 0 02 m and the incident wave period t varied from 1 50 s to 2 70 s at the step of 0 30 s for the irregular waves the significant wave height h s varied from 0 055 m to 0 141 m the average value of wave height h a varied from 0 035 m to 0 087 m and the spectral peak period t p varied from 1 95 s to 3 25 s the experimental scenarios are shown in table 1 all the experimental parameters were consistent with the rules of model limits reported by hughes 1993 and frostick et al 2011 3 3 d cfd mathematical model 3 1 governing equations garcia et al 2004 noted that the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans approximation performs well for determining hydrodynamic behavior for engineering purposes mainly due to simple reasonable assumptions and computation efforts therefore it was used to develop the 3 d cfd mathematical models the rans equations describe the mass and momentum conservation for impressible viscous flows as follows 1 u i x i 0 2 u i t u j u i x j 1 ρ p x i x j ν u i x j u i u j where x i is the cartesian space coordinate i 1 2 3 u i is the mean velocity component in i direction t is time ρ is water density p is pressure ν is the kinematic viscosity of water and u i u j denotes the reynolds stress tensor as a simple turbulent model the renormalisation group rng k ε model can simulate complex flow phenomena effectively without major modification of constants or functions yakhot et al 1992 the transport equations of the turbulent kinetic energy k and the turbulent dissipation rate ε are depicted as follows 3 k t u j k x j x j ν ν t σ k k x j ν t u i x j u i x j u j x i ε 4 ε t u j ε x j x j ν t σ ε ν ε x j c ε 1 ε k ν t u i x j u i x j u j x i c ε 2 ε 2 k where ν t is the turbulent viscosity and ν t c μ k 2 ε c μ c ε 1 c ε 2 σ k and σ ε are model parameters with values of 0 09 1 44 1 92 1 00 and 1 3 respectively the volume of fluid vof technique proposed by hirt and nichols 1981 was used for wave surface tracking and the governing equation is represented as follows 5 α t α u i x i 0 where α is the volume fraction of water in a cell α 1 means the cell is full of water α 0 means it is full of air and 0 α 1 denotes that there is a water interface in the cell with respect to the vertical motion of heaving components newton s second law was used to conduct the governing equation as follows 6 m a c b v k k z f where z a and v are the instantaneous vertical displacement acceleration and velocity respectively of the heaving components m is the system mass including the net mass of heaving components and the additional mass of water body c b is the equivalent damping coefficient of the system including the structural damping coefficient caused by friction and the external damping coefficient caused by water suction and extrusion k k is the hydrostatic restoring coefficient and f is the vertical wave excitation force therefore the rans and rng k ε equations and the vof technique were used to model the regular wave motion and turbulence and eq 6 was used to explore the vertical motion of the heaving components 3 2 boundary conditions and grid sensitivity analysis to our knowledge waves play a significant role in the vertical motion of the heaving components regular waves were used in the 3 d cfd mathematical model to investigate the effect of waves on the heaving components due to their simplicity in contrast to irregular waves the equations of the mathematical model were solved using the flow 3d 11 2 software and fig 2 represents the boundary conditions the wave generation boundary ab was utilized to achieve the desired regular waves the porous medium boundary cd was used to absorb the incident wave and eliminate the reflected waves the no slip wall boundary was used for the bottom of the wave tank bd and the two sides the pressure inlet boundary ac was used on the wave tank top due to the relatively complex geometry of the heaving components it is difficult to directly model their heaving motion along with the immovable components effect to simplify the model a cylindrical buoy of same volume and density was used to replace the heaving components the immovable components entity was ignored in the mathematical model and its effect was taken into account by using an equivalent damping coefficient the aforementioned method of replacing the heaving and immovable components was relatively simple however it worked well as explained in the following sections grid quality plays a significant role in the computational accuracy and speed of the mathematical model to examine the effect of grid independence on the numerical results the extrapolated relative error ere and the grid convergence index gci were calculated to estimate the discretization error celik et al 2008 for the scenario in which d 0 6 m h 0 16 m and t 2 7 s three uniform grids were used to calculate gci s 1 0 01 m s 2 0 02 m and s 3 0 03 m respectively additionally a computational domain within three times the height of the wave was refined to accurately capture the location of the wave surface the refined grid sizes were 0 005 m 0 01 m and 0 015 m respectively table 2 shows the discretization errors for the wave surface velocity u and elevation η at x 13 m for t 24 s the u and η of grids s 1 and s 2 did not show a large difference however the discretization error values of grid s 3 are larger than the corresponding values of s 1 and s 2 fig 3 shows the values of wave profile η at x 13 m for the three size grids the phases had a similar distribution and the wave profiles simulated using grids s 1 and s 2 are roughly consistent with each other however a relatively large deviation occurs between grids s 2 and s 3 thus grid 2 was chosen for the following computation after considering the numerical accuracy balance with the computational speed 3 3 mathematical model validation and numerical scenarios fig 4 shows the numerical and experimental η at x 11 m with the device effect for h in 0 45 m h 0 16 m t 2 7 s and c b 680 n s m compared to the data for negative η the duration of positive η is shorter its peak is also larger to some extent probably due to the complex effect of device on waves e g wave reflection the wave surface elevation increases quickly and decreases slowly which is visible from the steeper front slope and the comparatively gradual back slope nonlinear characteristics occur to a great extent especially at troughs in addition all the relative deviations between numerical and experimental data are less than 10 they roughly agree with each other therefore the 3 d cfd mathematical model is acceptable for use in exploring the hydrodynamic interaction between regular waves and heaving components fig 5 shows the vertical displacement z and velocity v histories of heaving components with h in 0 45 m t 1 8 s h 0 14 m and c b 680 n s m where positive and negative signs of the velocities express the upward and downward motions respectively the experimental and numerical data agrees well with each other their distributions are consistent with the simple harmonic functions and their periods agree with the incident wave period to a great extent in comparison approximately t 4 phase discrepancy occurs between z and v the value of z is higher than zero for a major portion this is because the floating center of heaving components is higher than the still water level swl of z 0 and the emerged volume of heaving components is greater than its submerged volume in addition a symmetrical distribution of v occurs roughly with the symmetry axis of v 0 indicating that the heaving components move steadily and periodically near the equilibrium position the mathematical model was used to predict the hydrodynamic behavior of heaving components with various densities of the heaving buoy ρ b buoy relative height ratio of buoy height h b to diameter d b h b d b and equivalent damping coefficient c b c b plays a significant role in the heaving component motion and the oxygen transfer performance however its accurate determination is arduous mainly due to the wave action on the device as well as the frictional force between heaving components and immovable components to simplify the model c b was used as 400 n s m to 800 n s m at the step of 100 n s m and ρ b increased from 320 kg m3 to 500 kg m3 at a step of 60 kg m3 for the given buoy volume of 0 00848 m3 d b varies from 0 20 m to 0 36 m at a step of 0 04 m the corresponding h b is roughly 0 270 m 0 187 m 0 138 m 0 105 m and 0 083 m and the corresponding h b d b is 1 35 0 78 0 49 0 33 and 0 23 respectively table 3 shows the 100 groups of numerical scenarios with h 0 16 m t 2 7 s and h in 0 45 m 4 results and discussions 4 1 hydrodynamic performance 4 1 1 effect of wave height on response amplitude and inlet flow rate the wave surface elevation and the vertical displacement and velocity of the buoy for regular waves are shown in figs 4 and 5 in real sea conditions waves are always characterized by random behavior with a specific spectrum their frequency spectra s f can be used to quantitatively describe the wave energy distribution as a function of wave frequency f in this study the joint north sea wave project jonswap spectrum was used to generate the irregular waves due to its wide utilization goda 1999 fig 6 a shows the measured wave profile η of an irregular wave train without the device for t p 2 25 s and h s 0 085 m the fast fourier transformation method is used to investigate the s f of aforementioned wave profile as shown in fig 6 b and the theoretical spectrum is also plotted for comparison the wave spectrum generated is consistent well with the theoretical wave spectrum for both peak frequency and the s f value illustrating the high accuracy of irregular waves generated in the experiments fig 7 illustrates the experimental z and v of heaving components with h in 0 45 m t p 2 25 s and h s 0 122 m and 0 137 m irregular waves the heaving components moved irregularly as expected and there was no regular phase discrepancy between z and v the time duration of a positive displacement is higher than that of a negative displacement possibly due to the higher water pressure at the exit of the outlet tube than that at the entrance of the inlet tube with lower wave heights it is not easy to press the oxygen rich water from the hydraulic cylinder into the bottom water this results in a number of positive displacement fluctuations at higher wave heights the heaving components move down with higher wave exciting force and a few minimum negative displacements values are seen instead of the similar fluctuations in positive displacement we further investigate the effect of incident wave height on the motion of the heaving components fig 8 shows the correlation between experimental response amplitude ra and the characteristic wave height for regular and irregular waves where z ar and z ai are the average values after subtracting all the crest values from all the trough values of z for regular and irregular waves respectively in addition every crest location is subtracted from the next trough location of heaving displacement curve for irregular waves and z si is defined as the average value of their highest third z ar increases steadily with increasing h for regular waves and z ai and z si show a similar increasing trend with h s for irregular waves which is consistent with the results reported by zang et al 2017 however z ai and z si increase with increasing h s for low h s and high t p scenarios and they increase slightly for low t p scenarios in contrast note that z ai decreases from h s 0 099 m to h s 0 134 m for t p 2 66 s curve as shown in fig 8 b disagreeing with the increasing tendency of other curves the accurate reason for this is still unknown and a possible explanation could be the complex effect of wave forces friction forces geometry of heaving components etc it is interesting to investigate the difference between ra of regular and irregular waves with same characteristic wave parameters however it is difficult to generate irregular waves with t p equal to t of regular waves in the experiments as a result the amplitude curve for irregular waves with t p 2 66 s was used due to its t p approximation of t 2 7 s for regular waves as for the low h h s scenarios z si of t p 2 66 s is close to z ar of t 2 7 s as shown in fig 8 a and the former is higher than the latter to some extent as shown in fig 8 b however the pattern reverses for high h h s scenarios as shown in fig 8 a and b in addition z ar z ai and z si increased with increasing t t p in general illustrating that the wave period plays a positive role in the ra furthermore z ar z ai and z si decreased with increasing h in as expected and a lower positioning of the water inlet contributed a great deal to the response performance of the heaving components fig 9 shows changes in q afr with h h s for different t t p where q afr is defined as the average flow rate through the inlet tube and was obtained by averaging the instantaneous flow rate measured by the flowmeter within 100 t t p periods it should be theoretically equal to the average flow rate of water released into the deep hypoxia zone when water compressibility in the hydraulic cylinder and the possible leakage through the gap between piston and the hydraulic cylinder are not considered for regular waves q afr increased rapidly with increasing h from 0 10 m to 0 14 m however the increase is gradual for values of h from 0 08 m to 0 10 m and 0 14 m 0 16 m for scenarios in which h is low its variation contributes little to q afr which itself is close to zero indicating that the heaving components hardly move because of the friction between the pin and the slider bars and the piston and inner wall of the hydraulic cylinder in addition q afr increases with increasing t especially in scenarios where h is high and t plays a positive role in q afr as consistent with the changes in the experimental ra of z ar with wave period shown in fig 8 it is expected that the q afr of irregular waves would increase roughly as h s increases mainly due to increasing z ai as shown in fig 8 one reason is that a high h s wave contributes much wave energy to the drive of heaving components and z ai and q afr increase as a result for the given h s scenarios q afr generally increases with increasing t p however q afr values vary little from t p 2 93 s to t p 3 25 s illustrating that t p has an insignificant impact on q afr in high t p scenarios in addition it is noted that the q afr of t 2 7 s is smaller than that of t p 2 66 s as shown both in fig 9 a for small wave height scenarios and fig 9 b however they are close to each other for the high wave height scenarios in fig 9 a the q afr at h in 0 15 is roughly higher than at h in 0 45 for regular and irregular waves illustrating that a low h in is beneficial for vertical water transport occurring when the device is used as efficiently as expected 4 1 2 effect of wave steepness on ra the wave steepness is of significance in defining the wave characteristics for regular waves its wave steepness λ is defined as follows 7 λ h l where l is the wave length l g t 2 2 π tanh k d and k is the regular wave number for irregular waves there is some lack of knowledge about wave steepness mainly due to its random characteristic and complex process the definition of regular wave steepness was taken into account and the significant wave steepness λ s was denoted for irregular waves as follows dnv 2014 8 λ s k p h s 2 π where k p is an average wave number obtained by using the linear dispersion relationship of regular waves for the real sea scenarios λ s was found to be smaller than 0 059 in general otherwise the breaking waves occurred dnv 2014 note that all the λ s values are well below the limit to avoid the wave breaking phenomena in our experiments fig 10 shows the relationships between relative ra of z ar h z ai h a and z si h s with wave steepness λ for regular waves λ s for irregular waves z ar h z ai h a and z si h s increase with increasing λ λ s for relatively small wave period scenarios for the scenarios t 1 5 s and t 1 8 s z ar h increases in a somewhat linear manner with increasing λ demonstrating that z ar h has a linear relationship with h in a scenario when l or t are kept at a constant low value for relatively large wave period scenarios the relative ra increases till it reaches a peak and then decreases with increasing λ λ s in small λ λ s scenarios the z ai h a and z si h s of t p 2 66 s are close to the z ar h of t 2 7 s with h in 0 15 m as shown in fig 10 a however the z ai h a and z si h s of t p 2 66 s are higher than z ar h of t 2 7 s to some extent with h in 0 45 m as shown in fig 10 b for large λ λ s scenarios the z ai h a and z si h s are smaller than z ar h as shown both in fig 10 a and b in addition z ar h z ai h a and z si h s decreases with increasing h in to some extent which is consistent with the trend in the relationship between z ar z ai and z si and h in as shown in fig 8 4 1 3 effect of buoy relative height on relative ra fig 11 shows the relationship between relative ra and buoy relative height for various equivalent damping coefficients using numerical data the z ar h decreases with increasing h b d b for given c b and ρ b scenarios as d b increases for a given h b the capturable wave frequency band widens and the kinetic energy of buoy increases contributing to promoting the vertical motion of the buoy as h b increases for a given d b the wave reflection strengthens dissipated wave energy increases and the wave energy absorption of the buoy and z ar h decrease 4 1 4 effect of equivalent damping coefficient on relative ra fig 12 shows the relationship of relative ra with the equivalent damping coefficient for different buoy diameters using numerical data it was found that z ar h decreases with increasing c b and it is expected that c b play a negative role in the vertical motion of the heaving components z ar h varies little with increasing ρ b from 320 kg m3 to 500 kg m3 as shown in figs 11 and 12 illustrating that the vertical motions of the heaving buoy is hardly sensitive to its density 4 2 oxygen transfer performance in the experiments 4 2 1 measured do concentration histories due to the similarity of h in 0 15 and h in 0 45 scenarios the following do transfer investigation was based on the h in 0 45 scenarios to simplify the research fig 13 shows the do concentration histories of 1 2 and 3 do probes with without the device for t 1 5 s and h 0 12 m as well as 0 16 m for regular waves it shows that with increasing time do concentrations increase to their higher values at first and then decrease to their lower values and they increase gradually to approach the saturated values as expected a stratification phenomenon for do concentration clearly occurs at initial time t 0 in still water the highest values occur at the surface water and the smallest values appear for the bottom water fig 13 a and c show that do concentrations measured by 1 and 2 do probes increase rapidly to their higher values at t 30 s mainly due to the wave surface turbulence subsequently they decrease to their smaller values near t 110 s due to the vertical transport and mixing between surface oxygen rich water and the lower hypoxia water and then increase the do concentration measured by 3 do probe increases little before about t 50 s because the bottom water is little influenced by the wave surface motion in a short time range and an increasing trend occurs mainly due to the vertical water transport rather than the surface wave effect in addition the three do concentration curves reach similar values at t 600 s indicating that its vertical distribution tends to be relatively uniform fig 13 b and d illustrate a tendency similar to fig 13 a and c however with the device do concentrations of the bottom water increase rapidly from 25 s to 40 s due to the vertical water transport originated mainly from the device reach the maximum values near t 50 s and then start to decrease the vertical distribution tends to be relatively uniform near t 600 s and differences between values from the three do probes are smaller than those without the device as shown in fig 13 a and c the do concentrations of the surface water and the bottom water are higher than that of the middle water from t 50 s to t 600 s confirming the device efficiency for vertical transport of water and do in addition fig 13 a and c show that the increase in amplitude measured by 3 do probe for h 0 16 m is relatively larger than that for h 0 12 m in the first 200 s period illustrating that the incident wave height contributes a great deal to the vertical transport of water and do fig 14 shows the do concentration histories of 1 2 and 3 do probes with without the device for t p 1 95 s h s 0 101 m and 0 138 m for irregular waves we observed that the trend of do concentrations is similar to that for regular waves as shown in fig 13 however a number of relatively large fluctuations of do concentration occur especially before t 500 s mainly due to the random characteristic of irregular waves and it takes longer time to approach the saturated values fig 14 b and d show that do concentration in the bottom water is roughly larger than that in the middle water due to the effect of the device fig 14 d illustrates that do concentration in the bottom water is close to that of surface water at 200 s t 700 s however the former is lower than latter to some extent in fig 14 b confirming the wave height contribution to vertical water and do transport 4 2 2 oxygen transfer coefficient on wave surface the oxygen transfer between wave water and atmosphere occurs on the free surface and the amount of transfer over unit area and time f can be expressed as follows 9 f d c d t k a c s c where ka is the oxygen transfer coefficient on wave surface k is the liquid film mass transfer coefficient on wave surface a is the specific surface area for wave water and c s is the saturated do concentration related to water temperature and pressure lide 2001 after integrating eq 9 over time a relative saturation coefficient e is obtained as follows 10 e c 1 c 0 c s c 0 1 exp k a δ t where c 0 is the average do concentration at the initial time c 1 is the average do concentration at the present time and t is the time duration between c 0 and c 1 eq 10 can be written as 11 k a ln 1 e δ t using eqs 10 to 11 and experimental data the values of k 1 a 1 without the device and k 2 a 2 with the device were determined for waves due to the simplification of regular waves considerable attention has been devoted to its oxygen transfer on free surface daniil and gulliver 1991 presented the predictive equation of k 1 for regular waves as follows 12 k 1 0 0159 h s c 0 5 t where sc is the schmidt number s c ν d ν is kinematic viscosity and d is diffusion coefficient 13 a 1 a 1 v 1 14 a 1 2 0 l 2 1 π 2 h 2 l 2 cos 2 2 π l x d x where v 1 and a 1 are the water volume and the wave surface area per unit width under a wave length scope respectively k 1 a 1 was determined theoretically without using the experimental data using eqs 12 14 when the incident waves pass through the device the wave transformations including its diffraction and radiation occur to some extent and the wave surface deforms therefore eqs 12 14 are incapable of examining oxygen transfer on the wave surface with complex wave behaviors fig 15 shows variation of k 1 a 1 and k 2 a 2 with wave steepness for h in 0 45 m scenario and their fitted curves are also illustrated increase in k 1 a 1 and k 2 a 2 with increasing wave steepness was expected for both regular and irregular waves for given l scenarios with regular waves a higher h results in the higher surface area a 1 denoted by eq 14 the higher a 1 expressed by eq 13 and the higher k 1 expressed by eq 12 simultaneously the incident wave energy and the turbulent intensity increase with increasing h and they promote the oxygen transfer from atmosphere to the water body in contrast with increasing l equivalently t for given h scenarios k 1 decreases as illustrated in eq 12 a 1 decreases simultaneously as denoted in eq 13 and k 1 a 1 reduces as a result k 1 a 1 determined by eqs 10 to 11 and experimental data is slightly higher than that determined by eqs 12 14 the essential reasons for these differences are not clear however a possible explanation is that only three do probes were used to measure the do concentrations in our experiments and their average value was assumed as the do concentration of flume water which resulted in some deviations from the actual data in addition k 2 a 2 is significantly higher than k 1 a 1 fig 15 indicating the high oxygen transfer efficiency of the device and k 1 a 1 and k 2 a 2 for irregular waves are larger than those for regular waves with equal wave steepness the data points of k 2 a 2 are more scattered and square of correlation coefficient r 2 of k 2 a 2 is noticeably smaller than that for k 1 a 1 this is probably due to the complex effect of the device and waves on water turbulence and oxygen transfer in our experiments the vortices were generated near the bottom corner of the buoy and a deal of atmosphere was entrained to produce the air bubbles consistent well with the results reported by zang et al 2017 the bubbles play a significant role in the water turbulence strength and oxygen transfer performance and they contribute significantly to k 2 a 2 and its fluctuation as expected r 2 of k 1 a 1 is smaller for irregular waves than that for regular waves due to random strong instability characteristics of irregular waves however r 2 of k 2 a 2 is larger for irregular waves than that for regular waves and a possible reason is that irregular waves contribute more to the water and do transfer stability with the device than regular waves 5 conclusions in this study a new wave energy utilization device was designed for transporting the superficial oxygen rich water to the deeper hypoxia zone a series of physical experiments were conducted to investigate the hydrodynamic characteristics and oxygen transfer performance of the device for both regular and irregular waves in addition a simple 3 d cfd mathematical model was simulated to explore the regular wave motion and the vertical motion of heaving components using the rans and rng k ε equations the vof technique and newton s second law for regular waves the vertical displacements and velocities of the heaving components are consistent with the simple harmonic functions their periods clearly agree with the incident wave period and approximately t 4 phase discrepancy occurs between them for irregular waves the heaving components move irregularly as expected and a regular phase discrepancy is not observed between their displacement and velocity with the increase of characteristic wave height or wave period both ra of the heaving components and the average flow rate through the inlet tube increases however they decrease when the distance from the entrance of the inlet tube to the flume bottom is increased with increasing wave steepness the relative ra increases for relatively small wave period scenarios however it increases to achieve a peak and then decreases for relatively large wave period scenarios with the increase of equivalent damping coefficient or buoy relative height the relative ra decreases however the relative ra is hardly sensitive to the buoy density analysis of the oxygen transfer behavior with or without the device shows that oxygen transfer coefficients on wave surface increase with increasing wave steepness do concentrations of the bottom water and oxygen transfer coefficients with the device are higher than those without the device indicating the high oxygen transfer efficiency of the device the research limitations also should be clearly pointed out for future work firstly the wave force on the heaving components should be directly measured and analyzed in the experiments as well as the friction force between the immovable components and the heaving components secondly more do probes should be installed to measure the do concentration distribution in the whole flume to assess the oxygen transfer coefficient with better accuracy thirdly in this study we simulated a simple cfd mathematical model for regular waves a cylinder buoy was used to replace the heaving components effects of the immovable components were simulated using the equivalent damping coefficient hence the aforementioned simplification still needs a number of further investigations fourthly a 3 d mathematical model for irregular waves and oxygen transfer should be developed to investigate the hydrodynamic characteristics and oxygen transfer behavior in real sea climate for the purpose of engineering application finally the large waves and the biofouling will inevitably occur on the device in real sea and they play a negative role in the structure safety and the device efficiency the fixing technique of immovable components and the biofouling prevention method deserve a further examination in

transfer coefficient 1 introduction dissolved oxygen do concentration plays a significant role in the seawater environment and ecology in recent decades coastal hypoxia do concentration 2 0 mg l or approximately 30 saturation have spread globally mainly due to coastal eutrophication and vertical water column stratification it poses a severe threat to the normal growth and productive capacity of living organisms in the ecosystem and even triggers mortality events ram et al 2014 diaz and rosenberg 2008 pointed out that the number of global dead zones of hypoxia started to approximately double every ten years since the 1960s and 400 plus dead zone sites have been reported affecting a total area of more than 245 000 km2 as of 2008 unfortunately vast majority of the aforementioned sites continues to worsen in spite of remediation efforts to reduce organic and nutrient loadings and only a small proportion of 4 have shown improvement trends of do concentration in the bottom water diaz and rosenberg 2008 caballero alfonso et al 2015 in terms of spatial distribution do concentration in the bottom water is usually lower than that in the surface water due to non ventilation and vertical stratification strengthened by the global warming tendency scully 2010 bertone et al 2015 gold et al 2017 in the case of the trieste gulf the adriatic sea in august 2016 the surface and 15 m depth do concentrations were measured as about 230 μmol l and 100 μmol l respectively at a northern station kralj et al 2019 the surface and 20 m depth do concentrations were measured as 263 μmol kg and 81 μmol kg respectively in a south depression basin at bohai sea china during august 2014 zhao et al 2017 the do concentrations were measured as more than 6 3 mg l for the surface water and below 2 6 mg l at 20 m depth location in the east china sea in august 2013 in addition a sharp density gradient was observed under the mixed layer to restrict vertical re aeration across the strong pycnocline illustrating that the density increase and stratification in deeper water contribute negatively to transporting superficial oxygen rich water to bottom hypoxic zones chen et al 2007 vertical mixing in the water column and circulation play significant roles in enhancing do concentration in the bottom water diaz and rosenberg 2008 recently considerable attention has been devoted to analyzing the effect of natural processes such as wind waves tides and even river discharge on hypoxia pu et al 2016 basdurak et al 2013 shu et al 2011 paskyabi and fer 2012 duan et al 2012 however little research has been conducted on strengthening vertical mixing and circulation in a water body using an artificial device stommel et al 1956 first proposed the concept of a perpetual salt fountain created using long pipes to pump nutrient rich deep water to the surface for fishing and farming applications vershinskiy et al 1987 evaluated the theoretical performance of using a wave pump for artificial upwelling and its capacity and efficiency were explored based on wave amplitude and frequency and its dimensions liu and jin 1995 numerically investigated the hydrodynamic performance of a wave driven artificial upwelling device and evaluated the upwelling flow rate for regular and random incident waves fan et al 2015 numerically examined the flow and nutrient transport of a deep ocean water plume in the south china sea using an artificial upwelling device pan et al 2016 reviewed current progress in the artificial upwelling system and its potential environmental effects and the air lift concept of artificial upwelling draws particular attention with the aim of increasing the concentration of do in bottom water a new floating device called oxyflux was proposed and experimentally and numerically assessed in terms of its dynamic response and pumping capacity for various wave parameters considering the nonlinear effects on its dynamic behavior antonini et al 2015 2016 margheritini and claeson 2011 field tested their wave energized baltic aeration pump off the stockholm coast in summer 2010 to demonstrate the technical and financial feasibility of attempting to counteract hypoxia and anoxia in the deep water layers in addition the floating body motion in waves has attracted a great deal of attention in recent years nallayarasu and saravanapriya 2013a 2013b nallayarasu and bairathi 2014 and nallayarasu et al 2014 carried out a series of experimental numerical and theoretical investigations on the motion response of spar in regular and random waves and the effect of spar hulls shape was analyzed to obtain the motion response characteristics in this study a new wave energy utilization device is presented to transport the superficial oxygen rich water to the deeper hypoxia zone it could increase do concentration to counteract oxygen depletion at the bottom layers while enhancing the vertical mixing capacity and strengthening the water destratification the remainder of the paper is organized as follows the experiments are presented in section 2 including the device structure physical principle experimental facilities setup and

device used in this study is designed to counter hypoxia or anoxia in deep water it is driven by natural waves rather than electricity or fuel consequently it has a cost advantage and is environmentally friendly the device consists of two sets of parts i e heaving and immovable components as shown in fig 1 the heaving components consist of a hollow cylinder a connecting rod with cylindrical shape and a circular piston the hollow cylinder is 0 30 m in diameter and 0 12 m in height to absorb incident wave energy as a heaving buoy the connecting rod is 0 02 m in diameter and 0 48 m in height and the circular piston is 0 060 m in diameter and 0 002 m in height to pull in or extrude oxygen rich upper water a venthole is opened vertically through the hollow cylinder the air pressure among the piston top inner wall of hydraulic cylinder and connecting rod approaches the atmospheric value it varies little with the motion of heaving components without the air sucking and press effect and the mechanical energy loss of the device reduces to improve the heaving performance as a result the overall average density of the hollow cylinder is 295 kg m3 the immovable components consist of a circular gravity base 0 50 m in diameter and 0 01 m in height at the bottom to assure stability under the wave effect three cylindrical slide bars each 0 01 m in diameter and 1 00 m in height to control the vertical motion of the heaving components and a hydraulic cylinder 0 060 m in inner diameter 0 063 m in outer diameter and 0 480 m in height to store the oxygen rich water all attached to two circular supporting frames the hydraulic cylinder has an open top and closed bottom there are two circular holes 0 01 m in diameter at the bottom one connects to an inlet tube 0 01 m in diameter through a one way inlet valve to pull in oxygen rich surface water and the other connects to an outlet tube 0 01 m in diameter through a one way outlet valve to release the oxygen rich water into the deep hypoxic zone the adhesive tapes are used to tightly fix the inlet and outlet tubes on the side wall of the flume with desired heights and the motions of inlet and outlet tubes are not observed in the experiments particular attention was paid to the diameter of the piston given the inner diameter of hydraulic cylinder this is important because an oversized piston can cause excessive friction with the inner wall of the hydraulic cylinder reducing the efficiency of water transport and potentially rendering a device unworkable while an undersized piston can create large gap between the piston and inner wall of the hydraulic cylinder causing more water to flow through the gap and decreasing water transport efficiency in the experiments the exterior margin of piston is made of rubber material to slightly deform with the friction effect and the mineral lubricating oil is used to reduce the friction the wear and the water leakage between piston and inner wall of hydraulic cylinder the working principle of the device is simple when the wave surface ascends the heaving components move upward along the three slide bars under the actions of buoyancy and wave excitation force as the pressure between the bottom of the hydraulic cylinder and the piston decreases the surface oxygen rich water is pulled into the hydraulic cylinder through the inlet tube and valve due to the pressure difference and then stored when the wave surface descends the heaving components move downward along the three slide bars under the action of gravity increasing the pressure between the hydraulic cylinder bottom and the piston and the inside oxygen rich water is extruded into the deep hypoxic zone through the outlet tube and valve 2 2 experimental setup and scenarios to examine the hydrodynamic characteristics and surface oxygen rich water transport efficiency a series of experiments were conducted in a wave flume with 25 0 m length 1 0 m width and 1 2 m height at the hydrodynamic laboratory of ocean university of china fig 2 shows the experimental setup at one end of the wave flume a vertical piston type wave paddle was used to generate the regular and irregular waves and a large quantity of porous material was installed at the other end to absorb the waves as well as to avoid unwanted wave reflection the device was fixed 13 m from the wave generation end and two iron bricks were placed at the gravity base to ensure the stability of immovable components the vertical distance between the entrance of the inlet tube and the flume bottom h in was set as 0 15 m and 0 45 m respectively and the vertical distance between the exit of the outlet tube and the flume bottom h out was fixed as 0 02 m a flowmeter was attached to the inlet tube to measure the flow process a displacement sensor was fixed on the top portion of the heaving components to measure their displacement history and their heaving velocity was calculated using the displacement history three wave gauges with a sampling frequency of 50 hz were installed along the longitudinal axis of the flume three jpb 607a do probes 1 2 and 3 made in shanghai inesa scientific instrument co ltd with the accuracy of 0 0001 kg m3 were calibrated using the winkler technique and then placed 0 50 m 0 25 m and 0 02 m from the flume bottom respectively to measure the do concentration c in the surface middle and bottom water layer yakushev et al 2012 the water temperature was also measured varying from 25 8 c to 26 2 c the still water depth d was kept as a constant 0 60 m for all the experimental scenarios for the regular waves the incident wave height h ranged from 0 08 m to 0 16 m at the step of 0 02 m and the incident wave period t varied from 1 50 s to 2 70 s at the step of 0 30 s for the irregular waves the significant wave height h s varied from 0 055 m to 0 141 m the average value of wave height h a varied from 0 035 m to 0 087 m and the spectral peak period t p varied from 1 95 s to 3 25 s the experimental scenarios are shown in table 1 all the experimental parameters were consistent with the rules of model limits reported by hughes 1993 and frostick et al 2011 3 3 d cfd mathematical model 3 1 governing equations garcia et al 2004 noted that the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans approximation performs well for determining hydrodynamic behavior for engineering purposes mainly due to simple reasonable assumptions and computation efforts therefore it was used to develop the 3 d cfd mathematical models the rans equations describe the mass and momentum conservation for impressible viscous flows as follows 1 u i x i 0 2 u i t u j u i x j 1 ρ p x i x j ν u i x j u i u j where x i is the cartesian space coordinate i 1 2 3 u i is the mean velocity component in i direction t is time ρ is water density p is pressure ν is the kinematic viscosity of water and u i u j denotes the reynolds stress tensor as a simple turbulent model the renormalisation group rng k ε model can simulate complex flow phenomena effectively without major modification of constants or functions yakhot et al 1992 the transport equations of the turbulent kinetic energy k and the turbulent dissipation rate ε are depicted as follows 3 k t u j k x j x j ν ν t σ k k x j ν t u i x j u i x j u j x i ε 4 ε t u j ε x j x j ν t σ ε ν ε x j c ε 1 ε k ν t u i x j u i x j u j x i c ε 2 ε 2 k where ν t is the turbulent viscosity and ν t c μ k 2 ε c μ c ε 1 c ε 2 σ k and σ ε are model parameters with values of 0 09 1 44 1 92 1 00 and 1 3 respectively the volume of fluid vof technique proposed by hirt and nichols 1981 was used for wave surface tracking and the governing equation is represented as follows 5 α t α u i x i 0 where α is the volume fraction of water in a cell α 1 means the cell is full of water α 0 means it is full of air and 0 α 1 denotes that there is a water interface in the cell with respect to the vertical motion of heaving components newton s second law was used to conduct the governing equation as follows 6 m a c b v k k z f where z a and v are the instantaneous vertical displacement acceleration and velocity respectively of the heaving components m is the system mass including the net mass of heaving components and the additional mass of water body c b is the equivalent damping coefficient of the system including the structural damping coefficient caused by friction and the external damping coefficient caused by water suction and extrusion k k is the hydrostatic restoring coefficient and f is the vertical wave excitation force therefore the rans and rng k ε equations and the vof technique were used to model the regular wave motion and turbulence and eq 6 was used to explore the vertical motion of the heaving components 3 2 boundary conditions and grid sensitivity analysis to our knowledge waves play a significant role in the vertical motion of the heaving components regular waves were used in the 3 d cfd mathematical model to investigate the effect of waves on the heaving components due to their simplicity in contrast to irregular waves the equations of the mathematical model were solved using the flow 3d 11 2 software and fig 2 represents the boundary conditions the wave generation boundary ab was utilized to achieve the desired regular waves the porous medium boundary cd was used to absorb the incident wave and eliminate the reflected waves the no slip wall boundary was used for the bottom of the wave tank bd and the two sides the pressure inlet boundary ac was used on the wave tank top due to the relatively complex geometry of the heaving components it is difficult to directly model their heaving motion along with the immovable components effect to simplify the model a cylindrical buoy of same volume and density was used to replace the heaving components the immovable components entity was ignored in the mathematical model and its effect was taken into account by using an equivalent damping coefficient the aforementioned method of replacing the heaving and immovable components was relatively simple however it worked well as explained in the following sections grid quality plays a significant role in the computational accuracy and speed of the mathematical model to examine the effect of grid independence on the numerical results the extrapolated relative error ere and the grid convergence index gci were calculated to estimate the discretization error celik et al 2008 for the scenario in which d 0 6 m h 0 16 m and t 2 7 s three uniform grids were used to calculate gci s 1 0 01 m s 2 0 02 m and s 3 0 03 m respectively additionally a computational domain within three times the height of the wave was refined to accurately capture the location of the wave surface the refined grid sizes were 0 005 m 0 01 m and 0 015 m respectively table 2 shows the discretization errors for the wave surface velocity u and elevation η at x 13 m for t 24 s the u and η of grids s 1 and s 2 did not show a large difference however the discretization error values of grid s 3 are larger than the corresponding values of s 1 and s 2 fig 3 shows the values of wave profile η at x 13 m for the three size grids the phases had a similar distribution and the wave profiles simulated using grids s 1 and s 2 are roughly consistent with each other however a relatively large deviation occurs between grids s 2 and s 3 thus grid 2 was chosen for the following computation after considering the numerical accuracy balance with the computational speed 3 3 mathematical model validation and numerical scenarios fig 4 shows the numerical and experimental η at x 11 m with the device effect for h in 0 45 m h 0 16 m t 2 7 s and c b 680 n s m compared to the data for negative η the duration of positive η is shorter its peak is also larger to some extent probably due to the complex effect of device on waves e g wave reflection the wave surface elevation increases quickly and decreases slowly which is visible from the steeper front slope and the comparatively gradual back slope nonlinear characteristics occur to a great extent especially at troughs in addition all the relative deviations between numerical and experimental data are less than 10 they roughly agree with each other therefore the 3 d cfd mathematical model is acceptable for use in exploring the hydrodynamic interaction between regular waves and heaving components fig 5 shows the vertical displacement z and velocity v histories of heaving components with h in 0 45 m t 1 8 s h 0 14 m and c b 680 n s m where positive and negative signs of the velocities express the upward and downward motions respectively the experimental and numerical data agrees well with each other their distributions are consistent with the simple harmonic functions and their periods agree with the incident wave period to a great extent in comparison approximately t 4 phase discrepancy occurs between z and v the value of z is higher than zero for a major portion this is because the floating center of heaving components is higher than the still water level swl of z 0 and the emerged volume of heaving components is greater than its submerged volume in addition a symmetrical distribution of v occurs roughly with the symmetry axis of v 0 indicating that the heaving components move steadily and periodically near the equilibrium position the mathematical model was used to predict the hydrodynamic behavior of heaving components with various densities of the heaving buoy ρ b buoy relative height ratio of buoy height h b to diameter d b h b d b and equivalent damping coefficient c b c b plays a significant role in the heaving component motion and the oxygen transfer performance however its accurate determination is arduous mainly due to the wave action on the device as well as the frictional force between heaving components and immovable components to simplify the model c b was used as 400 n s m to 800 n s m at the step of 100 n s m and ρ b increased from 320 kg m3 to 500 kg m3 at a step of 60 kg m3 for the given buoy volume of 0 00848 m3 d b varies from 0 20 m to 0 36 m at a step of 0 04 m the corresponding h b is roughly 0 270 m 0 187 m 0 138 m 0 105 m and 0 083 m and the corresponding h b d b is 1 35 0 78 0 49 0 33 and 0 23 respectively table 3 shows the 100 groups of numerical scenarios with h 0 16 m t 2 7 s and h in 0 45 m 4 results and discussions 4 1 hydrodynamic performance 4 1 1 effect of wave height on response amplitude and inlet flow rate the wave surface elevation and the vertical displacement and velocity of the buoy for regular waves are shown in figs 4 and 5 in real sea conditions waves are always characterized by random behavior with a specific spectrum their frequency spectra s f can be used to quantitatively describe the wave energy distribution as a function of wave frequency f in this study the joint north sea wave project jonswap spectrum was used to generate the irregular waves due to its wide utilization goda 1999 fig 6 a shows the measured wave profile η of an irregular wave train without the device for t p 2 25 s and h s 0 085 m the fast fourier transformation method is used to investigate the s f of aforementioned wave profile as shown in fig 6 b and the theoretical spectrum is also plotted for comparison the wave spectrum generated is consistent well with the theoretical wave spectrum for both peak frequency and the s f value illustrating the high accuracy of irregular waves generated in the experiments fig 7 illustrates the experimental z and v of heaving components with h in 0 45 m t p 2 25 s and h s 0 122 m and 0 137 m irregular waves the heaving components moved irregularly as expected and there was no regular phase discrepancy between z and v the time duration of a positive displacement is higher than that of a negative displacement possibly due to the higher water pressure at the exit of the outlet tube than that at the entrance of the inlet tube with lower wave heights it is not easy to press the oxygen rich water from the hydraulic cylinder into the bottom water this results in a number of positive displacement fluctuations at higher wave heights the heaving components move down with higher wave exciting force and a few minimum negative displacements values are seen instead of the similar fluctuations in positive displacement we further investigate the effect of incident wave height on the motion of the heaving components fig 8 shows the correlation between experimental response amplitude ra and the characteristic wave height for regular and irregular waves where z ar and z ai are the average values after subtracting all the crest values from all the trough values of z for regular and irregular waves respectively in addition every crest location is subtracted from the next trough location of heaving displacement curve for irregular waves and z si is defined as the average value of their highest third z ar increases steadily with increasing h for regular waves and z ai and z si show a similar increasing trend with h s for irregular waves which is consistent with the results reported by zang et al 2017 however z ai and z si increase with increasing h s for low h s and high t p scenarios and they increase slightly for low t p scenarios in contrast note that z ai decreases from h s 0 099 m to h s 0 134 m for t p 2 66 s curve as shown in fig 8 b disagreeing with the increasing tendency of other curves the accurate reason for this is still unknown and a possible explanation could be the complex effect of wave forces friction forces geometry of heaving components etc it is interesting to investigate the difference between ra of regular and irregular waves with same characteristic wave parameters however it is difficult to generate irregular waves with t p equal to t of regular waves in the experiments as a result the amplitude curve for irregular waves with t p 2 66 s was used due to its t p approximation of t 2 7 s for regular waves as for the low h h s scenarios z si of t p 2 66 s is close to z ar of t 2 7 s as shown in fig 8 a and the former is higher than the latter to some extent as shown in fig 8 b however the pattern reverses for high h h s scenarios as shown in fig 8 a and b in addition z ar z ai and z si increased with increasing t t p in general illustrating that the wave period plays a positive role in the ra furthermore z ar z ai and z si decreased with increasing h in as expected and a lower positioning of the water inlet contributed a great deal to the response performance of the heaving components fig 9 shows changes in q afr with h h s for different t t p where q afr is defined as the average flow rate through the inlet tube and was obtained by averaging the instantaneous flow rate measured by the flowmeter within 100 t t p periods it should be theoretically equal to the average flow rate of water released into the deep hypoxia zone when water compressibility in the hydraulic cylinder and the possible leakage through the gap between piston and the hydraulic cylinder are not considered for regular waves q afr increased rapidly with increasing h from 0 10 m to 0 14 m however the increase is gradual for values of h from 0 08 m to 0 10 m and 0 14 m 0 16 m for scenarios in which h is low its variation contributes little to q afr which itself is close to zero indicating that the heaving components hardly move because of the friction between the pin and the slider bars and the piston and inner wall of the hydraulic cylinder in addition q afr increases with increasing t especially in scenarios where h is high and t plays a positive role in q afr as consistent with the changes in the experimental ra of z ar with wave period shown in fig 8 it is expected that the q afr of irregular waves would increase roughly as h s increases mainly due to increasing z ai as shown in fig 8 one reason is that a high h s wave contributes much wave energy to the drive of heaving components and z ai and q afr increase as a result for the given h s scenarios q afr generally increases with increasing t p however q afr values vary little from t p 2 93 s to t p 3 25 s illustrating that t p has an insignificant impact on q afr in high t p scenarios in addition it is noted that the q afr of t 2 7 s is smaller than that of t p 2 66 s as shown both in fig 9 a for small wave height scenarios and fig 9 b however they are close to each other for the high wave height scenarios in fig 9 a the q afr at h in 0 15 is roughly higher than at h in 0 45 for regular and irregular waves illustrating that a low h in is beneficial for vertical water transport occurring when the device is used as efficiently as expected 4 1 2 effect of wave steepness on ra the wave steepness is of significance in defining the wave characteristics for regular waves its wave steepness λ is defined as follows 7 λ h l where l is the wave length l g t 2 2 π tanh k d and k is the regular wave number for irregular waves there is some lack of knowledge about wave steepness mainly due to its random characteristic and complex process the definition of regular wave steepness was taken into account and the significant wave steepness λ s was denoted for irregular waves as follows dnv 2014 8 λ s k p h s 2 π where k p is an average wave number obtained by using the linear dispersion relationship of regular waves for the real sea scenarios λ s was found to be smaller than 0 059 in general otherwise the breaking waves occurred dnv 2014 note that all the λ s values are well below the limit to avoid the wave breaking phenomena in our experiments fig 10 shows the relationships between relative ra of z ar h z ai h a and z si h s with wave steepness λ for regular waves λ s for irregular waves z ar h z ai h a and z si h s increase with increasing λ λ s for relatively small wave period scenarios for the scenarios t 1 5 s and t 1 8 s z ar h increases in a somewhat linear manner with increasing λ demonstrating that z ar h has a linear relationship with h in a scenario when l or t are kept at a constant low value for relatively large wave period scenarios the relative ra increases till it reaches a peak and then decreases with increasing λ λ s in small λ λ s scenarios the z ai h a and z si h s of t p 2 66 s are close to the z ar h of t 2 7 s with h in 0 15 m as shown in fig 10 a however the z ai h a and z si h s of t p 2 66 s are higher than z ar h of t 2 7 s to some extent with h in 0 45 m as shown in fig 10 b for large λ λ s scenarios the z ai h a and z si h s are smaller than z ar h as shown both in fig 10 a and b in addition z ar h z ai h a and z si h s decreases with increasing h in to some extent which is consistent with the trend in the relationship between z ar z ai and z si and h in as shown in fig 8 4 1 3 effect of buoy relative height on relative ra fig 11 shows the relationship between relative ra and buoy relative height for various equivalent damping coefficients using numerical data the z ar h decreases with increasing h b d b for given c b and ρ b scenarios as d b increases for a given h b the capturable wave frequency band widens and the kinetic energy of buoy increases contributing to promoting the vertical motion of the buoy as h b increases for a given d b the wave reflection strengthens dissipated wave energy increases and the wave energy absorption of the buoy and z ar h decrease 4 1 4 effect of equivalent damping coefficient on relative ra fig 12 shows the relationship of relative ra with the equivalent damping coefficient for different buoy diameters using numerical data it was found that z ar h decreases with increasing c b and it is expected that c b play a negative role in the vertical motion of the heaving components z ar h varies little with increasing ρ b from 320 kg m3 to 500 kg m3 as shown in figs 11 and 12 illustrating that the vertical motions of the heaving buoy is hardly sensitive to its density 4 2 oxygen transfer performance in the experiments 4 2 1 measured do concentration histories due to the similarity of h in 0 15 and h in 0 45 scenarios the following do transfer investigation was based on the h in 0 45 scenarios to simplify the research fig 13 shows the do concentration histories of 1 2 and 3 do probes with without the device for t 1 5 s and h 0 12 m as well as 0 16 m for regular waves it shows that with increasing time do concentrations increase to their higher values at first and then decrease to their lower values and they increase gradually to approach the saturated values as expected a stratification phenomenon for do concentration clearly occurs at initial time t 0 in still water the highest values occur at the surface water and the smallest values appear for the bottom water fig 13 a and c show that do concentrations measured by 1 and 2 do probes increase rapidly to their higher values at t 30 s mainly due to the wave surface turbulence subsequently they decrease to their smaller values near t 110 s due to the vertical transport and mixing between surface oxygen rich water and the lower hypoxia water and then increase the do concentration measured by 3 do probe increases little before about t 50 s because the bottom water is little influenced by the wave surface motion in a short time range and an increasing trend occurs mainly due to the vertical water transport rather than the surface wave effect in addition the three do concentration curves reach similar values at t 600 s indicating that its vertical distribution tends to be relatively uniform fig 13 b and d illustrate a tendency similar to fig 13 a and c however with the device do concentrations of the bottom water increase rapidly from 25 s to 40 s due to the vertical water transport originated mainly from the device reach the maximum values near t 50 s and then start to decrease the vertical distribution tends to be relatively uniform near t 600 s and differences between values from the three do probes are smaller than those without the device as shown in fig 13 a and c the do concentrations of the surface water and the bottom water are higher than that of the middle water from t 50 s to t 600 s confirming the device efficiency for vertical transport of water and do in addition fig 13 a and c show that the increase in amplitude measured by 3 do probe for h 0 16 m is relatively larger than that for h 0 12 m in the first 200 s period illustrating that the incident wave height contributes a great deal to the vertical transport of water and do fig 14 shows the do concentration histories of 1 2 and 3 do probes with without the device for t p 1 95 s h s 0 101 m and 0 138 m for irregular waves we observed that the trend of do concentrations is similar to that for regular waves as shown in fig 13 however a number of relatively large fluctuations of do concentration occur especially before t 500 s mainly due to the random characteristic of irregular waves and it takes longer time to approach the saturated values fig 14 b and d show that do concentration in the bottom water is roughly larger than that in the middle water due to the effect of the device fig 14 d illustrates that do concentration in the bottom water is close to that of surface water at 200 s t 700 s however the former is lower than latter to some extent in fig 14 b confirming the wave height contribution to vertical water and do transport 4 2 2 oxygen transfer coefficient on wave surface the oxygen transfer between wave water and atmosphere occurs on the free surface and the amount of transfer over unit area and time f can be expressed as follows 9 f d c d t k a c s c where ka is the oxygen transfer coefficient on wave surface k is the liquid film mass transfer coefficient on wave surface a is the specific surface area for wave water and c s is the saturated do concentration related to water temperature and pressure lide 2001 after integrating eq 9 over time a relative saturation coefficient e is obtained as follows 10 e c 1 c 0 c s c 0 1 exp k a δ t where c 0 is the average do concentration at the initial time c 1 is the average do concentration at the present time and t is the time duration between c 0 and c 1 eq 10 can be written as 11 k a ln 1 e δ t using eqs 10 to 11 and experimental data the values of k 1 a 1 without the device and k 2 a 2 with the device were determined for waves due to the simplification of regular waves considerable attention has been devoted to its oxygen transfer on free surface daniil and gulliver 1991 presented the predictive equation of k 1 for regular waves as follows 12 k 1 0 0159 h s c 0 5 t where sc is the schmidt number s c ν d ν is kinematic viscosity and d is diffusion coefficient 13 a 1 a 1 v 1 14 a 1 2 0 l 2 1 π 2 h 2 l 2 cos 2 2 π l x d x where v 1 and a 1 are the water volume and the wave surface area per unit width under a wave length scope respectively k 1 a 1 was determined theoretically without using the experimental data using eqs 12 14 when the incident waves pass through the device the wave transformations including its diffraction and radiation occur to some extent and the wave surface deforms therefore eqs 12 14 are incapable of examining oxygen transfer on the wave surface with complex wave behaviors fig 15 shows variation of k 1 a 1 and k 2 a 2 with wave steepness for h in 0 45 m scenario and their fitted curves are also illustrated increase in k 1 a 1 and k 2 a 2 with increasing wave steepness was expected for both regular and irregular waves for given l scenarios with regular waves a higher h results in the higher surface area a 1 denoted by eq 14 the higher a 1 expressed by eq 13 and the higher k 1 expressed by eq 12 simultaneously the incident wave energy and the turbulent intensity increase with increasing h and they promote the oxygen transfer from atmosphere to the water body in contrast with increasing l equivalently t for given h scenarios k 1 decreases as illustrated in eq 12 a 1 decreases simultaneously as denoted in eq 13 and k 1 a 1 reduces as a result k 1 a 1 determined by eqs 10 to 11 and experimental data is slightly higher than that determined by eqs 12 14 the essential reasons for these differences are not clear however a possible explanation is that only three do probes were used to measure the do concentrations in our experiments and their average value was assumed as the do concentration of flume water which resulted in some deviations from the actual data in addition k 2 a 2 is significantly higher than k 1 a 1 fig 15 indicating the high oxygen transfer efficiency of the device and k 1 a 1 and k 2 a 2 for irregular waves are larger than those for regular waves with equal wave steepness the data points of k 2 a 2 are more scattered and square of correlation coefficient r 2 of k 2 a 2 is noticeably smaller than that for k 1 a 1 this is probably due to the complex effect of the device and waves on water turbulence and oxygen transfer in our experiments the vortices were generated near the bottom corner of the buoy and a deal of atmosphere was entrained to produce the air bubbles consistent well with the results reported by zang et al 2017 the bubbles play a significant role in the water turbulence strength and oxygen transfer performance and they contribute significantly to k 2 a 2 and its fluctuation as expected r 2 of k 1 a 1 is smaller for irregular waves than that for regular waves due to random strong instability characteristics of irregular waves however r 2 of k 2 a 2 is larger for irregular waves than that for regular waves and a possible reason is that irregular waves contribute more to the water and do transfer stability with the device than regular waves 5 conclusions in this study a new wave energy utilization device was designed for transporting the superficial oxygen rich water to the deeper hypoxia zone a series of physical experiments were conducted to investigate the hydrodynamic characteristics and oxygen transfer performance of the device for both regular and irregular waves in addition a simple 3 d cfd mathematical model was simulated to explore the regular wave motion and the vertical motion of heaving components using the rans and rng k ε equations the vof technique and newton s second law for regular waves the vertical displacements and velocities of the heaving components are consistent with the simple harmonic functions their periods clearly agree with the incident wave period and approximately t 4 phase discrepancy occurs between them for irregular waves the heaving components move irregularly as expected and a regular phase discrepancy is not observed between their displacement and velocity with the increase of characteristic wave height or wave period both ra of the heaving components and the average flow rate through the inlet tube increases however they decrease when the distance from the entrance of the inlet tube to the flume bottom is increased with increasing wave steepness the relative ra increases for relatively small wave period scenarios however it increases to achieve a peak and then decreases for relatively large wave period scenarios with the increase of equivalent damping coefficient or buoy relative height the relative ra decreases however the relative ra is hardly sensitive to the buoy density analysis of the oxygen transfer behavior with or without the device shows that oxygen transfer coefficients on wave surface increase with increasing wave steepness do concentrations of the bottom water and oxygen transfer coefficients with the device are higher than those without the device indicating the high oxygen transfer efficiency of the device the research limitations also should be clearly pointed out for future work firstly the wave force on the heaving components should be directly measured and analyzed in the experiments as well as the friction force between the immovable components and the heaving components secondly more do probes should be installed to measure the do concentration distribution in the whole flume to assess the oxygen transfer coefficient with better accuracy thirdly in this study we simulated a simple cfd mathematical model for regular waves a cylinder buoy was used to replace the heaving components effects of the immovable components were simulated using the equivalent damping coefficient hence the aforementioned simplification still needs a number of further investigations fourthly a 3 d mathematical model for irregular waves and oxygen transfer should be developed to investigate the hydrodynamic characteristics and oxygen transfer behavior in real sea climate for the purpose of engineering application finally the large waves and the biofouling will inevitably occur on the device in real sea and they play a negative role in the structure safety and the device efficiency the fixing technique of immovable components and the biofouling prevention method deserve a further examination in

22089,a data mining approach is presented for probabilistic characterization of maritime traffic and anomaly detection the approach automatically groups historical traffic data provided by the automatic identification system in terms of ship types sizes final destinations and other characteristics that influence the maritime traffic patterns off the continental coast of portugal the approach consists of identifying relevant waypoints along a route where significant changes in the ships navigational behaviour are observed such as changes in heading using trajectory compression and clustering algorithms this provides a vector based representation of the ship routes consisting of straight legs and connecting turning sections that facilitates route probabilistic characterization and anomaly detection the maritime traffic is characterized probabilistically at the identified route legs and waypoints in terms of lateral distribution of the trajectories and speed profile which allows the characterization of the typical behaviour of a group of similar ships along a particular route in the proposed approach heading changes are automatically detected using the douglas and peucker algorithm and clustered by the density based spatial clustering of applications with noise algorithm the proposed method is applied to the characterization of southbound maritime traffic from the traffic separation scheme off cape roca to the ports of lisbon setúbal and sines finally an example of ship trajectory anomaly detection based on the developed maritime traffic probabilistic models is provided keywords ais data data mining maritime traffic traffic characterization anomaly detection 1 introduction the maritime transportation is responsible for approximately 90 of the world s trade and more than 50 000 ships sail on the ocean each day agcs 2018 surveillance of maritime traffic is therefore of great importance for maritime safety and security the need to ensure the safety of navigation has led to the implementation of automatic identification system ais base stations which receive and maintain records of messages with dynamic and static information transmitted by ships although several types of errors in ais messages have been identified norris 2007 it is obvious that the system provides plenty of data for maritime traffic analysis and modelling tasks as information on the ships behaviour and traffic conditions is important in many maritime related studies tu et al 2018 the ais data provides navigational information of ships including the ship s name its particulars as well as ship s position speed and heading such information about ship s navigation behaviour has been used as input to many maritime risk models as reviewed by chen et al 2019 mou et al 2010 developed linear regression models of closest point of approach cpa and time to closest point of approach tcpa between collision involved ships based on ais data to evaluate the risk of ship collisions in the north sea off the port of rotterdam qu et al 2011 applied collision risk indices such as the speed dispersion degree of acceleration and deceleration and a number of fuzzy ship domain overlaps to assess quantitatively the collision risk at the singapore strait silveira et al 2013 proposed a method to determine the number of collision candidates based on available automatic identification system ais data with the concept of collision diameter defined by pedersen 1995 the concept of ship domain has been used to identify near collision scenarios by using simulation models of ship navigation in restricted waters and ais data rong et al 2015a b which allowed the characterization of near ship collision scenarios off the coast of portugal in terms of ship types and dimensions crossing angle relative velocity among others rong et al 2016 zhang et al 2015 proposed the vessel conflict ranking operator vcro model to rank the risk level of various ship encounter situations based on maritime expert judgements the model considers the interaction between the two vessels namely the relative speed the angle and the distance between the ships this model has been improved by adding the ship size and the minimum distance to collision mdtc concept that is related to the urgency of evasive manoeuvring for better assessing the risk of the ship encounters zhang et al 2016 the spatial analysis of near collisions identifies potentially dangerous locations for the maritime transportation and provides relevant information for traffic monitoring and control in this context wu et al 2016 have investigated features of vessel conflicts in the southeast texas waterway in terms of vessel size spatial distribution time of day and the risk level of vessel collisions defined by vessel conflict ranking operator vcro model developed by zhang et al 2015 yoo 2018 has estimated the near collision density in coastal areas and has identified high collision risk locations based on ais data along the same line rong at al 2019a have adopted collision risk indicators including the dcpa tcpa and the relative distance between ships to assess the collision risk of near collision scenarios identified from historical ais data spatial density maps of the collision risk are then derived using the kernel density estimation method even though the analysis of near collision scenarios can be used for maritime traffic risk assessment a further insight into the characteristics of local maritime traffic is of great importance to maintain the operational efficiency and safety of the maritime transportation the characterization of the maritime traffic patterns supports maritime surveillance as it provides information on the typical trajectories of ships along the main traffic routes the ship motion data provided by ais can be grouped based on the similarity behaviour of the ships trajectories to provide an overview of the general motion patterns and can be used to model the ship routes various traffic motion pattern extraction methods are available for converting raw ais data into effective traffic patterns including computer vision techniques aarsæther and moan 2009 statistical analysis techniques etienne et al 2012 and clustering methods pallotta et al 2013 de vries et al 2012 traffic motion pattern extraction methods aim at grouping ship trajectories following the same itinerary the traffic motion pattern once extracted can be exploited to characterize the ship behaviour within the motion pattern in a macro level kang et al 2018 applied the weighted least square approach to study the ship traffic speed density relation of the singapore strait traffic motion patterns wu et al 2018b studied the travel behaviour of ships in narrow waterways using ais data in terms of distributions of flow speeds and densities of ships as well as their relationships with the high vessel conflicts areas identified by wu et al 2016 and have assessed the collision risk in these locations chen et al 2018 developed a ship trajectory classification model by adopting least squares cubic spline curves approximation lcsca technique to represent the ship trajectories ais data from the port of rotterdam was analysed and clustered by zhou et al 2019 based on the characterization of ship behaviour clusters it was possible to detect and rank collision risk between encounter ships within each cluster a clustering based method for extracting maritime traffic patterns from historical ais data has also been presented by sun et al 2015 the extracted maritime traffic pattern enabled constructing a normalcy model that can be used for anomaly detection the vessel traffic and motion information can also be exploited to perform ship route prediction at a given time by incorporating both the traffic pattern and ship motion behaviour knowledge xiao et al 2017 proposed a ship traffic prediction method capable of predicting maritime traffic 5 30 and 60 min ahead rong et al 2019b have adopted gaussian process models derived from historical ais data for probabilistic ship trajectory prediction within motion patterns and for collision probability evaluation rong et al 2020 previous research works on ship traffic learning from ais data have shown that valuable knowledge about the ship behaviour can be extracted through the analysis of historical data however the existing studies are mainly focused on the behaviour of ships in specific ship routes a new trend in the field of maritime traffic characterization is to adopt a vector based representation of ship routes defined as a set of straight legs connecting turning sections rong et al 2018 proposed a data mining method on ais data to automatically identify maritime traffic junctions and applied a multinomial logistic regression model for predicting the ships destination based on a set of characteristics of the ships behaviour at the junction zhang et al 2018 applied data driven approaches including ship trajectory compression and clustering methods to determine the general behaviour and spatial patterns of trajectories following the same route as a result of the characterization of the maritime traffic patterns applications and services such as ship behaviour recognition trajectory prediction and abnormal traffic behaviour can be developed in this study a data mining approach is proposed for probabilistic characterization of the maritime traffic off the continental coast of portugal based on automatic identification system data that combines trajectory compression and clustering algorithms to characterize routes as a set of straight legs and connecting turning sections this way probabilistic models of the ship trajectories can be easily derived along a vector based representation of the ship routes to support ship abnormal behaviour detection the probabilistic characterization of the maritime traffic and the definition of operational profiles and specific routes off the continental coast of portugal will reduce the uncertainty of each operation thus increasing the overall safety level and the efficiency of the current maritime operations this can benefit many maritime stakeholders for optimizing their operations such as port operators pilotage services ship owners and ship operators moreover these routes defined in terms of waypoints derived from historical ais data have the potential to become one of the key enablers for future autonomous vessels traffic operations e g xu et al 2019 moreover the main characteristics of traffic parameters can be used as input for the traffic simulation which is useful for risk management rong et al 2015a b van dorp et al 2011 goerlandt et al 2011 and channel capacity assessment with increased traffic volume xin et al 2019 finally the probabilistic characterization of the ship trajectories along a given route enables real time anomaly detection which is an important feature for developing alerts to support traffic supervision and control tasks the approach is applied to the southbound traffic passing the traffic separation scheme off cape roca toward the ports of lisbon setúbal and sines finally an example of online ship trajectory anomaly detection is provided the approach uses the normalcy models of the maritime traffic derived from historical ais data to identify ship trajectories that deviate probabilistically from the normal behaviour of a class of ships in a particular route 2 methodology the aim of this study is to characterize the motion patterns and shipping routes based on historical ais data the analysis of traffic patterns is essential as it provides the possibility to integrate and enrich maritime traffic services including route modelling trajectory prediction and detection of abnormal traffic behaviour the extraction of traffic patterns starts by grouping ship trajectories following the same itinerary by clustering static or entry and exit points corresponding to starting and ending locations of the motion pattern fig 1 shows the flowchart of the proposed approach for maritime traffic characterization consisting of three main steps 1 define traffic patterns by grouping ship trajectories according to final destinations 2 waypoints and route legs identification 3 ship behaviour characterization at waypoints and route legs a shipping route is assumed as a set of straight segments or legs connecting waypoints corresponding to locations of significant changes in the navigational behaviour of the ships which allows a compact representation of ships motion in order to characterize the maritime traffic along a shipping route ship trajectories obtained from ais data are first grouped according to the final destination of the ships the ship trajectories within a particular motion pattern or route are then analysed so as to identify the waypoints where significant changes in the ships dynamic behaviour such as changes on heading or velocity are observed in particular waypoints corresponding to turning sections at specific locations along the route are identified turning point detection and clustering techniques are applied to detect maritime turning sections turning points of ship trajectories are detected based on douglas and peucker dp algorithm that allows detecting ship directional changes at the trajectory level based on spatial information douglas and peucker 1973 which is more reliable than the use of the course over ground cog for turning point detection a turning section corresponds to an area where a significant density of turning points is observed for this purpose the density based spatial clustering of applications with noise algorithm ester et al 1996 is adopted for clustering the turning points then the maritime traffic is characterized probabilistically at the identified waypoints and at route legs connecting the waypoints in terms of lateral distribution of the trajectories speed profile and ship traffic density which allows the characterization of the typical behaviour of a group of similar ships along a particular route as shown in fig 2 2 1 route turning section identification 2 1 1 douglas and peucker dp algorithm a route turning section is automatically identified by clustering turning points detected in ship trajectories a turning point in ship trajectory is where a significant directional change of the ship trajectory is observed the douglas and peucker dp algorithm typically used for ship trajectory compression can also be used for turning point detection the dp algorithm is an approach for reducing the number of points in a curve that is approximated by a series of points in the field of moving object analysis this algorithm has been used to compress trajectories data etienne et al 2012 this algorithm together with a suitable threshold parameter can be used to identify the relevant turning points along the ship trajectory according to the dp algorithm the first and last points of a given trajectory are kept automatically then the farthest point from the line defined by the first and last points of the trajectory is found if the transverse distance of the point to this line calculated by eq 1 exceeds the threshold then the point is retained the trajectory is then split at that position and the algorithm is recursively applied to both sub trajectories otherwise any point between first and last points of the trajectory or sub trajectories can be discarded see fig 3 for an illustration of the dp algorithm in the figure the solid lines represent the original trajectory and the dashed lines represent a dp simplified trajectory p 1 is the furthest point to the line defined by p start and p end the distance from p 1 to the line defined by p start and p end exceeds the threshold meaning that p 1 will be retained however distance from p 2 to the line defined by p start and p 1 and distance from p 3 to the line defined by p 1 and p end are smaller than the threshold and therefore the remainder points of both original sub trajectories are discarded 1 d i s t a n c e p a p b p y b y a x p x b x a y p x b y a y b x a x b x a 2 y b y a 2 where d i s t a n c e p a p b p is the distance from point p x p y p to the line defined by two points p a x a y a and p b x b y b 2 1 2 clustering turning points based on dbscan algorithm in the context of maritime traffic the retained points detected by the dp algorithm can be considered as turning points and the clustering of those turning points defines the turning sections along the ship route in this paper turning points clustering is based on the dbscan algorithm this algorithm forms clusters of elements based on the density of points in their neighbourhood in the clustering procedure the points are classified as core points density reachable points and noise as shown in fig 4 given a set of turning points d dbscan algorithm initially looks for core points i e points p i d such that n ε p i m i n p t s where n ε p i is the ε neighbourhood of p i once a core point is found such neighbourhood points are density reachable from p i and belong to the same cluster then the points that are not density reachable from other points are considered as noise the pseudocode of dbscan algorithm is expressed in algorithm 1 ester et al 1996 algorithm 1 dbscan d ε m i n p t s image 10570 the dbscan algorithm does not require the specification of the number of clusters in the data a priori however there is no general way of choosing minpts and the radius ε the setting of minpts requires some knowledge on the data density on study area however in the present case the algorithm has shown to be robust with respect to minpts as similar clustering structures are obtained for a wide range of minpts values between 5 and 10 the value of the radius ε is determined by a reachability plot of the ordered points produced by the optics algorithm ankerst et al 1999 that is a plot showing on the x axis the ordering of the points as processed by optics and the reachability distance on the y axis the reachability plot of the ordered points enables the visualization of the clustering structure of the data set fig 5 shows a graphical representation of density based clustering structure of a data set since points belonging to a cluster have a low reachability distance to their nearest neighbour the clusters correspond to valleys in the reachability plot 2 2 characterization of ship traffic behaviour along the route after identifying the route waypoints corresponding to turning sections or significant changes on the ships velocities the maritime traffic at the waypoints and route legs between waypoints is characterized as shown in fig 2 in particular at the turning sections of the route ship speed distribution and traffic density are statistically analysed in order to investigate the relationship between ship speed and traffic density ship speed profiles under different traffic densities are studied the maritime traffic at the route legs is also characterized in terms of ship speed distribution ship heading distribution and lateral distribution of ship trajectories 3 case study the maritime areas off the continental coast of portugal are crossed by a complex network of routes where routes connecting northern europe and the mediterranean sea meet vessels bound to and leaving from national ports two traffic separation schemes tsss located off cape roca and off cape san vincente organize the northbound and southbound traffic of dangerous and non dangerous cargo off the coast of portugal and influence significantly the routes of the ships entering and leaving the national ports of lisbon setúbal and sines as shown in fig 6 in this paper the suggested approach to define and characterize shipping routes according to the ships final destination is applied to the southbound maritime traffic data passing the tss off cape roca to the ports of lisbon setúbal and sines over a period of three months from 1st october to december 31 2015 fig 6 shows the ensemble of the southbound ship trajectories to the ports of lisbon setúbal and sines 3 1 maritime traffic groups first the southbound maritime traffic passing the tss off cape roca is grouped into motion patterns or main routes defined by the ship trajectories corresponding to the different ports of destination in particular the maritime traffic in this area is divided into four motion patterns which are 1 non dangerous traffic lane to lisbon port 2 non dangerous traffic lane to setúbal port 3 non dangerous traffic lane to sines port and 4 dangerous traffic lane to sines port the motion patterns generally show a certain geographic clustering of the ship trajectories as the individual ships follow a similar path to their final destinations fig 7 shows the southbound maritime traffic passing the tss off cape roca extracted from three months of ais data grouped in terms of the different final destinations the number of ship trajectories in each group is shown in table 1 one can see that the number of ship trajectories to the three ports is similar fig 7 shows some outlier trajectories in each traffic group identified in green an outlier is a data point that stands out in contrast to the other data points around it the task of outlier detection consists of inferring whether the data point deviates significantly from the data these trajectory outliers are removed before the characterization of the ship route as explained below the definition of the spatial distribution of trajectories along the ship route starts by estimating the route centreline according to rong et al 2019a b each ais position record of a ship trajectory within each traffic group is aligned based on the dynamic time warping algorithm and then the route centreline is derived from the arithmetic mean of the aligned elements let p l a t p l n g p be a point on the geographic coordinate system and let c l c l 1 c l n represent the centerline of the ship route where c l i l a t c l i l n g c l i p is the point from object p projected on the centreline c l and located in two adjacent centerline points c l i c l i 1 then the longitudinal and lateral distance of point p s p u p on the ship route can be calculated by 2 s p j 1 i 1 c l j 1 c l j p c l i 3 u p p p in this study a normal distribution is adopted to describe the spatial distribution of the ship lateral position this way outliers can be considered to be points that lie three or more standard deviations from the mean of the normal distribution therefore outlier trajectories can be identified if the lateral distance of trajectories points is significantly large 3 2 turning points sections knowing where a ship changes its heading is important to characterize the normal behaviour of the traffic along the route and therefore the dp algorithm described before is used for ship trajectory compression and turning point detection according to the relationship between threshold of dp algorithm and average number of retained points fig 8 it can be seen that the trajectory points reduce as the tolerance increases and tend to stabilise when the threshold is greater than 500m the aim of trajectory compression based on the dp algorithm is to decrease the number of retained points keeping an adequate trajectory representation therefore the threshold distance is set to 500 m in this study the turning points detected along the ship routes passing the tts off cape roca to the three ports are shown in fig 9 a black points then turning sections are identified by the spatial distribution of the coordinates of the turning points detected to investigate the spatial distribution of the turning points the kernel density estimation kde method is applied to estimate the spatial density distribution of the turning points on the study area the kde method constructs the spatial density distribution by placing a kernel function on the turning points the spatial density distribution is given by 4 g x y 1 n h 2 i 1 n ϕ x x i 2 y y i 2 h where n is the number of turning points h is the bandwidth of the kernel function in this study the most commonly used squared exponential kernel function is adopted 5 ϕ x 1 2 π σ 2 exp x 2 2 σ 2 where σ is the standard deviation of the samples if the gaussian basis kernel function is used to approximate samples the underlying density being estimated is gaussian then the optimal choice for bandwidth h is silverman 1986 6 h 4 σ 5 3 n 1 5 1 06 σ n 1 5 fig 10 shows the spatial density distribution of the turning points the study area is discretized in a 600 500 grid and the spatial density distribution of the turning points at each cell is calculated using the kde method and depicted using the rgb red green blue colour code once the density value of each grid cell is calculated the colours of the grids are determined according to the corresponding turning points 3 3 characteristics of the maritime traffic in each turning section a statistical analysis of the maritime traffic shows that the southbound traffic passing the tss off cape roca consists mainly of cargo ships and tankers which account for 69 5 and 27 6 respectively different routes are used by different ship types most of the ships that visit the ports of lisbon and setúbal are cargo ships 72 7 and 96 3 respectively whereas 44 6 of the ships toward the port of sines are tankers as shown in table 2 passenger ships only navigate in routes to the port of lisbon and setúbal on the other hand 86 2 of the tankers sail to sines port the characteristics of the ship type distributions of each motion pattern imply that ship route was used by different ship types fig 11 shows the speed distributions of ships in each turning section and a statistical summary of the speed distributions can be found in table 3 it is seen that the average ship speed at turning section 1 is higher than at the others 12 59 versus 8 94 9 28 and 8 17 respectively turning sections 2 4 correspond to the entrances of ports of lisbon setúbal and sines where the ship speed is limited due to the geophysical characteristics of restricted waterways from the speed distribution of tankers in turning section 1 fig 11a one can see that the average speed of tankers is slightly higher than the average speed of general ship types in turning section 1 a t test showed that the speed distribution of all ship types and tankers is well approximated by a normal distribution p value equal to 0 59 and 0 5 respectively in addition the standard deviation of the tankers speed is smaller than that of all ships it should be mentioned that the speed distribution at turning section 4 is not normally distributed the southbound ship route to the port of sines is dominated by tankers and near the port of sines there exists an anchoring area the travel behaviour of tankers in section 4 is more complex compared with that of ships in turning sections 2 and 3 the revealed ship trajectory data makes it possible to study the density of ships in the corresponding route in this study the density of a ship at a section simply refers to the number of ships at this section it should be mentioned that the estimation of density takes all collected historical ais data into consideration fig 12 shows the ship density distribution at each turning section according to fig 12a it can be found that 17 9 21 7 and 18 9 of ships encounter 3 5 other ships in section 1 respectively in section 2 and section 3 ships are less likely to encounter more than three ships 72 2 and 51 7 in section 2 and section 3 respectively in terms of environmental pollution tankers pose a high environmental risk as they carry large amounts of oil or toxic chemicals in this study the density distribution when a tanker is at turning section 1 is presented fig 12a also shows that it is more likely for a tanker to encounter three or four ships 30 and 23 3 respectively in turning section 1 the inbound ship traffic to the port of sines is dominated by tankers see table 2 71 2 of ships encounter only one or two ship in section 4 entrance of port sines which indicates that the entrance in the port of sines seems is less congested the speed distributions and density distribution of each section is presented above respectively in the following for the general traffic flow of all types of ships and traffic flow of tankers the mean speed under different traffic density level were investigated as shown in fig 13 it is seen that the density level did not significantly affect ship speed in addition the difference between minimum and maximum speed of mean speed distribution in section 2 and section 4 fig 13 are 1 9 knot and 2 16 knot the nearly flat curves imply that the speeds at these two sections are free flow speeds which indicate that these two sections do not suffer from serious traffic congestion 3 4 characteristics of the maritime traffic in the route legs as the port of sines is the main port on the atlantic seaboard of portugal due to its geophysical characteristics it is the main gateway to the energy supply of portugal natural gas coal oil and its derivatives in terms of environmental pollution tankers pose a high environmental risk as they carry large amounts of oil or toxic chemicals an example of an accident of this type that occurred close to the entrance of sines is described by sebastião and guedes soares 2006 while a more general description of pollution accidents in the portuguese coast can be found in gouveia and guedes soares 2010 a statistical analysis is performed to study the maritime traffic on the route passing southbound dangerous traffic lane to port of sines as tanker is the main ship type in this route as shown in fig 14 the ship route that passes the southbound dangerous traffic lane to port of sines is divided by two turning sections derived above in leg 1 ships move southward toward the tss off cape roca s southbound dangerous traffic lane then in turning section 1 ships turn east toward sines port in leg 2 fig 15 illustrates the speed and cog distributions of ships in the two legs in terms of speed distributions it is seen that most ships in this route sail at 12 15 knots 70 9 in leg 1 and 66 2 in leg 2 respectively fig 15b shows cog distributions at each leg obviously there are significant differences between the traffic in each leg one may notice two peaks in the histogram of cog which correspond to the two directions of the legs the lateral distribution reflects the spatial extension of the ship routes fig 16 shows the lateral distributions of the ship trajectories in the two legs on the x axis the zero value corresponds to the calculated route centreline a positive value for x means that the vessel sails to the starboard side of the route centreline the comparison of lateral distribution of leg 1 and leg 2 shows that the deviation of lateral distribution in leg 2 is larger which means that ship trajectories in leg 1 are more concentrated on the route centreline it is found that route width changes along the route fig 14 for example at the north part of leg 2 the route is narrow whereas at other locations the distribution over the route is relatively wide this indicates that the lateral distribution along the waterway needs to be investigated the route width is estimated according to trajectory spatial distribution along the ship route once the route centreline is derived the lateral distributions along legs 1 and 2 are calculated from the available ais data at every 16 and 5 nautical miles nm respectively as shown in fig 17 the leg lateral distribution is approximated by a normal distribution and then the 95 probability interval of the distribution is adopted as the route width the grey box indicates the 95 confidence interval estimated by the series of route widths in a given section according to fig 17a the route width estimated by ais data varies considerably the reason is that the uncertainty in ship trajectories varies along the route the route width distribution in leg 2 fig 17b indicates that the route become wider along the route from turning section 1 to turning section 4 an obvious change is observed from the first 5nm section to the second 5nm section restricted by the tss off cape roca traffic lane ships are convergence in the traffic route therefore the route width at leg 2 is narrow only 2800m in the first 5nm section the width of ship route increases steady from 20 nautical miles to 60 nautical miles along leg 2 and finally reaches at 18500 m 3 5 anomaly detection the characterization of ship behaviour within motion patterns based on historical ais data provides important information for maritime traffic surveillance in this study ship routes are characterized probabilistically and the motion of the ships is described by a series of gaussian distributions this normalcy representation supports anomaly detection of ship trajectories that deviate from the route behaviour ship trajectories can be outliers for different types of reasons ships may sail to irregular place turn to destination ahead or delayed of schedule and steering to the left or to the right of the main route followed by most of ships anomalies could also be the result of accidental situations of ships that lose control due to failure of its propulsion or course keeping equipment e g wu et al 2017 2018a as shown in fig 18 a a new ship is first associated to the route passing southbound dangerous traffic lane to the sines port based on the ship position it is assumed that the ship lateral position is normal distributed along the ship route and therefore the probability that the ship belongs to the route is calculated by the normal probability density distribution where u p is the lateral distance of point p and σ is the standard deviation of the lateral distribution at the current section then off route behaviour is detected by calculating the value of the gaussian distribution function at the ship lateral position if the value is below a threshold then the ship is detected as not following the route fig 18b shows the ship in route probability corresponding to its lateral position the grey area and red dash line demonstrate the main route and the route centreline followed by most of the ship trajectories the 95 probability interval of the lateral traffic distribution is adopted to define the boundaries of the waterway it can be seen that the probability decreases dramatically when the ship trajectory located out of the route the off route behaviour detection results suggest that the method is capable of detecting unexpected departures from regular movements however this detection method is a distance based approach which means that the velocity and acceleration of the ships are not taken into consideration 4 conclusions the proposed data mining method provides a relatively straightforward and unsupervised approach to determine maritime turning sections and to characterize the maritime traffic in each turning section the turning section is automatically identified using ship trajectory compression and turning point detection techniques and clustering methods in particular the trajectory compression dp algorithm is adopted for turning point detection and a density based clustering algorithm is applied for clustering these dispersed points into clusters the clusters of turning points forms turning sections of the route which benefits greatly from the previous compression step the turning section is the geographical area where the turning behaviour is frequently observed in this study the kernel density estimation method is applied to estimate the density area based on the identified turning points then relatively high density areas form turning sections of the ship route this method is applied to southbound ship trajectories passing the traffic separation scheme off cape roca to the ports of lisbon setúbal and sines four main turning sections have been identified at the exit of the tss off cape roca and along the three routes to lisbon setúbal and sines a statistical analysis of the maritime traffic at the turning sections shows that the ship type distribution depends on the route destination most cargo ships visit the ports of lisbon and setúbal whereas tankers dominate in the dangerous traffic lane of tss off cape roca and in the route to sines the speed distributions of the ships in each section reveal that ships sailed at higher speed in turning section 1 than in other sections in addition the average speed of tankers is slightly higher than the average speed of other ship types in addition according to the speed distributions divided by the density of ships in each section it is found that the density of ships does not significantly affect the ship speed tankers pose higher environmental risk and dominate the route passing southbound dangerous traffic lane of tss off cape roca to the port of sines therefore the characteristics of the maritime traffic in this route is further analysed two turning sections haven been identified dividing this route in two legs speed and cog distributions as well as lateral distributions of the ship trajectories have been derived and analysed from the available ais data the investigation of the lateral distribution in the two legs indicates that the ship trajectories in leg 1 are more concentrated on the route centreline compared with leg 2 the lateral distributions along the ship route show that the route width changes with the route location furthermore the uncertainty in the route width also varies along the route and a high variability on the ship trajectories is observed at the entrance of the port of sines the lateral distributions of the maritime traffic along the ship route characterize in a probabilistic manner the route centreline and the route spatial extension followed by most of the ship trajectories ship off route behaviour detection is then tested on an abnormal ship trajectory the ship is first assigned to a route ship route passing the southbound dangerous traffic lane to the sines port and off route behaviour is detected according to the lateral position probability defined by a gaussian distribution in this study the route width is considered as three standard deviations from the mean route and the off route detection threshold is set as the corresponding probability value however the choice of thresholds is a critical aspect of the detection strategy which should be further investigated author

22089,a data mining approach is presented for probabilistic characterization of maritime traffic and anomaly detection the approach automatically groups historical traffic data provided by the automatic identification system in terms of ship types sizes final destinations and other characteristics that influence the maritime traffic patterns off the continental coast of portugal the approach consists of identifying relevant waypoints along a route where significant changes in the ships navigational behaviour are observed such as changes in heading using trajectory compression and clustering algorithms this provides a vector based representation of the ship routes consisting of straight legs and connecting turning sections that facilitates route probabilistic characterization and anomaly detection the maritime traffic is characterized probabilistically at the identified route legs and waypoints in terms of lateral distribution of the trajectories and speed profile which allows the characterization of the typical behaviour of a group of similar ships along a particular route in the proposed approach heading changes are automatically detected using the douglas and peucker algorithm and clustered by the density based spatial clustering of applications with noise algorithm the proposed method is applied to the characterization of southbound maritime traffic from the traffic separation scheme off cape roca to the ports of lisbon setúbal and sines finally an example of ship trajectory anomaly detection based on the developed maritime traffic probabilistic models is provided keywords ais data data mining maritime traffic traffic characterization anomaly detection 1 introduction the maritime transportation is responsible for approximately 90 of the world s trade and more than 50 000 ships sail on the ocean each day agcs 2018 surveillance of maritime traffic is therefore of great importance for maritime safety and security the need to ensure the safety of navigation has led to the implementation of automatic identification system ais base stations which receive and maintain records of messages with dynamic and static information transmitted by ships although several types of errors in ais messages have been identified norris 2007 it is obvious that the system provides plenty of data for maritime traffic analysis and modelling tasks as information on the ships behaviour and traffic conditions is important in many maritime related studies tu et al 2018 the ais data provides navigational information of ships including the ship s name its particulars as well as ship s position speed and heading such information about ship s navigation behaviour has been used as input to many maritime risk models as reviewed by chen et al 2019 mou et al 2010 developed linear regression models of closest point of approach cpa and time to closest point of approach tcpa between collision involved ships based on ais data to evaluate the risk of ship collisions in the north sea off the port of rotterdam qu et al 2011 applied collision risk indices such as the speed dispersion degree of acceleration and deceleration and a number of fuzzy ship domain overlaps to assess quantitatively the collision risk at the singapore strait silveira et al 2013 proposed a method to determine the number of collision candidates based on available automatic identification system ais data with the concept of collision diameter defined by pedersen 1995 the concept of ship domain has been used to identify near collision scenarios by using simulation models of ship navigation in restricted waters and ais data rong et al 2015a b which allowed the characterization of near ship collision scenarios off the coast of portugal in terms of ship types and dimensions crossing angle relative velocity among others rong et al 2016 zhang et al 2015 proposed the vessel conflict ranking operator vcro model to rank the risk level of various ship encounter situations based on maritime expert judgements the model considers the interaction between the two vessels namely the relative speed the angle and the distance between the ships this model has been improved by adding the ship size and the minimum distance to collision mdtc concept that is related to the urgency of evasive manoeuvring for better assessing the risk of the ship encounters zhang et al 2016 the spatial analysis of near collisions identifies potentially dangerous locations for the maritime transportation and provides relevant information for traffic monitoring and control in this context wu et al 2016 have investigated features of vessel conflicts in the southeast texas waterway in terms of vessel size spatial distribution time of day and the risk level of vessel collisions defined by vessel conflict ranking operator vcro model developed by zhang et al 2015 yoo 2018 has estimated the near collision density in coastal areas and has identified high collision risk locations based on ais data along the same line rong at al 2019a have adopted collision risk indicators including the dcpa tcpa and the relative distance between ships to assess the collision risk of near collision scenarios identified from historical ais data spatial density maps of the collision risk are then derived using the kernel density estimation method even though the analysis of near collision scenarios can be used for maritime traffic risk assessment a further insight into the characteristics of local maritime traffic is of great importance to maintain the operational efficiency and safety of the maritime transportation the characterization of the maritime traffic patterns supports maritime surveillance as it provides information on the typical trajectories of ships along the main traffic routes the ship motion data provided by ais can be grouped based on the similarity behaviour of the ships trajectories to provide an overview of the general motion patterns and can be used to model the ship routes various traffic motion pattern extraction methods are available for converting raw ais data into effective traffic patterns including computer vision techniques aarsæther and moan 2009 statistical analysis techniques etienne et al 2012 and clustering methods pallotta et al 2013 de vries et al 2012 traffic motion pattern extraction methods aim at grouping ship trajectories following the same itinerary the traffic motion pattern once extracted can be exploited to characterize the ship behaviour within the motion pattern in a macro level kang et al 2018 applied the weighted least square approach to study the ship traffic speed density relation of the singapore strait traffic motion patterns wu et al 2018b studied the travel behaviour of ships in narrow waterways using ais data in terms of distributions of flow speeds and densities of ships as well as their relationships with the high vessel conflicts areas identified by wu et al 2016 and have assessed the collision risk in these locations chen et al 2018 developed a ship trajectory classification model by adopting least squares cubic spline curves approximation lcsca technique to represent the ship trajectories ais data from the port of rotterdam was analysed and clustered by zhou et al 2019 based on the characterization of ship behaviour clusters it was possible to detect and rank collision risk between encounter ships within each cluster a clustering based method for extracting maritime traffic patterns from historical ais data has also been presented by sun et al 2015 the extracted maritime traffic pattern enabled constructing a normalcy model that can be used for anomaly detection the vessel traffic and motion information can also be exploited to perform ship route prediction at a given time by incorporating both the traffic pattern and ship motion behaviour knowledge xiao et al 2017 proposed a ship traffic prediction method capable of predicting maritime traffic 5 30 and 60 min ahead rong et al 2019b have adopted gaussian process models derived from historical ais data for probabilistic ship trajectory prediction within motion patterns and for collision probability evaluation rong et al 2020 previous research works on ship traffic learning from ais data have shown that valuable knowledge about the ship behaviour can be extracted through the analysis of historical data however the existing studies are mainly focused on the behaviour of ships in specific ship routes a new trend in the field of maritime traffic characterization is to adopt a vector based representation of ship routes defined as a set of straight legs connecting turning sections rong et al 2018 proposed a data mining method on ais data to automatically identify maritime traffic junctions and applied a multinomial logistic regression model for predicting the ships destination based on a set of characteristics of the ships behaviour at the junction zhang et al 2018 applied data driven approaches including ship trajectory compression and clustering methods to determine the general behaviour and spatial patterns of trajectories following the same route as a result of the characterization of the maritime traffic patterns applications and services such as ship behaviour recognition trajectory prediction and abnormal traffic behaviour can be developed in this study a data mining approach is proposed for probabilistic characterization of the maritime traffic off the continental coast of portugal based on automatic identification system data that combines trajectory compression and clustering algorithms to characterize routes as a set of straight legs and connecting turning sections this way probabilistic models of the ship trajectories can be easily derived along a vector based representation of the ship routes to support ship abnormal behaviour detection the probabilistic characterization of the maritime traffic and the definition of operational profiles and specific routes off the continental coast of portugal will reduce the uncertainty of each operation thus increasing the overall safety level and the efficiency of the current maritime operations this can benefit many maritime stakeholders for optimizing their operations such as port operators pilotage services ship owners and ship operators moreover these routes defined in terms of waypoints derived from historical ais data have the potential to become one of the key enablers for future autonomous vessels traffic operations e g xu et al 2019 moreover the main characteristics of traffic parameters can be used as input for the traffic simulation which is useful for risk management rong et al 2015a b van dorp et al 2011 goerlandt et al 2011 and channel capacity assessment with increased traffic volume xin et al 2019 finally the probabilistic characterization of the ship trajectories along a given route enables real time anomaly detection which is an important feature for developing alerts to support traffic supervision and control tasks the approach is applied to the southbound traffic passing the traffic separation scheme off cape roca toward the ports of lisbon setúbal and sines finally an example of online ship trajectory anomaly detection is provided the approach uses the normalcy models of the maritime traffic derived from historical ais data to identify ship trajectories that deviate probabilistically from the normal behaviour of a class of ships in a particular route 2 methodology the aim of this study is to characterize the motion patterns and shipping routes based on historical ais data the analysis of traffic patterns is essential as it provides the possibility to integrate and enrich maritime traffic services including route modelling trajectory prediction and detection of abnormal traffic behaviour the extraction of traffic patterns starts by grouping ship trajectories following the same itinerary by clustering static or entry and exit points corresponding to starting and ending locations of the motion pattern fig 1 shows the flowchart of the proposed approach for maritime traffic characterization consisting of three main steps 1 define traffic patterns by grouping ship trajectories according to final destinations 2 waypoints and route legs identification 3 ship behaviour characterization at waypoints and route legs a shipping route is assumed as a set of straight segments or legs connecting waypoints corresponding to locations of significant changes in the navigational behaviour of the ships which allows a compact representation of ships motion in order to characterize the maritime traffic along a shipping route ship trajectories obtained from ais data are first grouped according to the final destination of the ships the ship trajectories within a particular motion pattern or route are then analysed so as to identify the waypoints where significant changes in the ships dynamic behaviour such as changes on heading or velocity are observed in particular waypoints corresponding to turning sections at specific locations along the route are identified turning point detection and clustering techniques are applied to detect maritime turning sections turning points of ship trajectories are detected based on douglas and peucker dp algorithm that allows detecting ship directional changes at the trajectory level based on spatial information douglas and peucker 1973 which is more reliable than the use of the course over ground cog for turning point detection a turning section corresponds to an area where a significant density of turning points is observed for this purpose the density based spatial clustering of applications with noise algorithm ester et al 1996 is adopted for clustering the turning points then the maritime traffic is characterized probabilistically at the identified waypoints and at route legs connecting the waypoints in terms of lateral distribution of the trajectories speed profile and ship traffic density which allows the characterization of the typical behaviour of a group of similar ships along a particular route as shown in fig 2 2 1 route turning section identification 2 1 1 douglas and peucker dp algorithm a route turning section is automatically identified by clustering turning points detected in ship trajectories a turning point in ship trajectory is where a significant directional change of the ship trajectory is observed the douglas and peucker dp algorithm typically used for ship trajectory compression can also be used for turning point detection the dp algorithm is an approach for reducing the number of points in a curve that is approximated by a series of points in the field of moving object analysis this algorithm has been used to compress trajectories data etienne et al 2012 this algorithm together with a suitable threshold parameter can be used to identify the relevant turning points along the ship trajectory according to the dp algorithm the first and last points of a given trajectory are kept automatically then the farthest point from the line defined by the first and last points of the trajectory is found if the transverse distance of the point to this line calculated by eq 1 exceeds the threshold then the point is retained the trajectory is then split at that position and the algorithm is recursively applied to both sub trajectories otherwise any point between first and last points of the trajectory or sub trajectories can be discarded see fig 3 for an illustration of the dp algorithm in the figure the solid lines represent the original trajectory and the dashed lines represent a dp simplified trajectory p 1 is the furthest point to the line defined by p start and p end the distance from p 1 to the line defined by p start and p end exceeds the threshold meaning that p 1 will be retained however distance from p 2 to the line defined by p start and p 1 and distance from p 3 to the line defined by p 1 and p end are smaller than the threshold and therefore the remainder points of both original sub trajectories are discarded 1 d i s t a n c e p a p b p y b y a x p x b x a y p x b y a y b x a x b x a 2 y b y a 2 where d i s t a n c e p a p b p is the distance from point p x p y p to the line defined by two points p a x a y a and p b x b y b 2 1 2 clustering turning points based on dbscan algorithm in the context of maritime traffic the retained points detected by the dp algorithm can be considered as turning points and the clustering of those turning points defines the turning sections along the ship route in this paper turning points clustering is based on the dbscan algorithm this algorithm forms clusters of elements based on the density of points in their neighbourhood in the clustering procedure the points are classified as core points density reachable points and noise as shown in fig 4 given a set of turning points d dbscan algorithm initially looks for core points i e points p i d such that n ε p i m i n p t s where n ε p i is the ε neighbourhood of p i once a core point is found such neighbourhood points are density reachable from p i and belong to the same cluster then the points that are not density reachable from other points are considered as noise the pseudocode of dbscan algorithm is expressed in algorithm 1 ester et al 1996 algorithm 1 dbscan d ε m i n p t s image 10570 the dbscan algorithm does not require the specification of the number of clusters in the data a priori however there is no general way of choosing minpts and the radius ε the setting of minpts requires some knowledge on the data density on study area however in the present case the algorithm has shown to be robust with respect to minpts as similar clustering structures are obtained for a wide range of minpts values between 5 and 10 the value of the radius ε is determined by a reachability plot of the ordered points produced by the optics algorithm ankerst et al 1999 that is a plot showing on the x axis the ordering of the points as processed by optics and the reachability distance on the y axis the reachability plot of the ordered points enables the visualization of the clustering structure of the data set fig 5 shows a graphical representation of density based clustering structure of a data set since points belonging to a cluster have a low reachability distance to their nearest neighbour the clusters correspond to valleys in the reachability plot 2 2 characterization of ship traffic behaviour along the route after identifying the route waypoints corresponding to turning sections or significant changes on the ships velocities the maritime traffic at the waypoints and route legs between waypoints is characterized as shown in fig 2 in particular at the turning sections of the route ship speed distribution and traffic density are statistically analysed in order to investigate the relationship between ship speed and traffic density ship speed profiles under different traffic densities are studied the maritime traffic at the route legs is also characterized in terms of ship speed distribution ship heading distribution and lateral distribution of ship trajectories 3 case study the maritime areas off the continental coast of portugal are crossed by a complex network of routes where routes connecting northern europe and the mediterranean sea meet vessels bound to and leaving from national ports two traffic separation schemes tsss located off cape roca and off cape san vincente organize the northbound and southbound traffic of dangerous and non dangerous cargo off the coast of portugal and influence significantly the routes of the ships entering and leaving the national ports of lisbon setúbal and sines as shown in fig 6 in this paper the suggested approach to define and characterize shipping routes according to the ships final destination is applied to the southbound maritime traffic data passing the tss off cape roca to the ports of lisbon setúbal and sines over a period of three months from 1st october to december 31 2015 fig 6 shows the ensemble of the southbound ship trajectories to the ports of lisbon setúbal and sines 3 1 maritime traffic groups first the southbound maritime traffic passing the tss off cape roca is grouped into motion patterns or main routes defined by the ship trajectories corresponding to the different ports of destination in particular the maritime traffic in this area is divided into four motion patterns which are 1 non dangerous traffic lane to lisbon port 2 non dangerous traffic lane to setúbal port 3 non dangerous traffic lane to sines port and 4 dangerous traffic lane to sines port the motion patterns generally show a certain geographic clustering of the ship trajectories as the individual ships follow a similar path to their final destinations fig 7 shows the southbound maritime traffic passing the tss off cape roca extracted from three months of ais data grouped in terms of the different final destinations the number of ship trajectories in each group is shown in table 1 one can see that the number of ship trajectories to the three ports is similar fig 7 shows some outlier trajectories in each traffic group identified in green an outlier is a data point that stands out in contrast to the other data points around it the task of outlier detection consists of inferring whether the data point deviates significantly from the data these trajectory outliers are removed before the characterization of the ship route as explained below the definition of the spatial distribution of trajectories along the ship route starts by estimating the route centreline according to rong et al 2019a b each ais position record of a ship trajectory within each traffic group is aligned based on the dynamic time warping algorithm and then the route centreline is derived from the arithmetic mean of the aligned elements let p l a t p l n g p be a point on the geographic coordinate system and let c l c l 1 c l n represent the centerline of the ship route where c l i l a t c l i l n g c l i p is the point from object p projected on the centreline c l and located in two adjacent centerline points c l i c l i 1 then the longitudinal and lateral distance of point p s p u p on the ship route can be calculated by 2 s p j 1 i 1 c l j 1 c l j p c l i 3 u p p p in this study a normal distribution is adopted to describe the spatial distribution of the ship lateral position this way outliers can be considered to be points that lie three or more standard deviations from the mean of the normal distribution therefore outlier trajectories can be identified if the lateral distance of trajectories points is significantly large 3 2 turning points sections knowing where a ship changes its heading is important to characterize the normal behaviour of the traffic along the route and therefore the dp algorithm described before is used for ship trajectory compression and turning point detection according to the relationship between threshold of dp algorithm and average number of retained points fig 8 it can be seen that the trajectory points reduce as the tolerance increases and tend to stabilise when the threshold is greater than 500m the aim of trajectory compression based on the dp algorithm is to decrease the number of retained points keeping an adequate trajectory representation therefore the threshold distance is set to 500 m in this study the turning points detected along the ship routes passing the tts off cape roca to the three ports are shown in fig 9 a black points then turning sections are identified by the spatial distribution of the coordinates of the turning points detected to investigate the spatial distribution of the turning points the kernel density estimation kde method is applied to estimate the spatial density distribution of the turning points on the study area the kde method constructs the spatial density distribution by placing a kernel function on the turning points the spatial density distribution is given by 4 g x y 1 n h 2 i 1 n ϕ x x i 2 y y i 2 h where n is the number of turning points h is the bandwidth of the kernel function in this study the most commonly used squared exponential kernel function is adopted 5 ϕ x 1 2 π σ 2 exp x 2 2 σ 2 where σ is the standard deviation of the samples if the gaussian basis kernel function is used to approximate samples the underlying density being estimated is gaussian then the optimal choice for bandwidth h is silverman 1986 6 h 4 σ 5 3 n 1 5 1 06 σ n 1 5 fig 10 shows the spatial density distribution of the turning points the study area is discretized in a 600 500 grid and the spatial density distribution of the turning points at each cell is calculated using the kde method and depicted using the rgb red green blue colour code once the density value of each grid cell is calculated the colours of the grids are determined according to the corresponding turning points 3 3 characteristics of the maritime traffic in each turning section a statistical analysis of the maritime traffic shows that the southbound traffic passing the tss off cape roca consists mainly of cargo ships and tankers which account for 69 5 and 27 6 respectively different routes are used by different ship types most of the ships that visit the ports of lisbon and setúbal are cargo ships 72 7 and 96 3 respectively whereas 44 6 of the ships toward the port of sines are tankers as shown in table 2 passenger ships only navigate in routes to the port of lisbon and setúbal on the other hand 86 2 of the tankers sail to sines port the characteristics of the ship type distributions of each motion pattern imply that ship route was used by different ship types fig 11 shows the speed distributions of ships in each turning section and a statistical summary of the speed distributions can be found in table 3 it is seen that the average ship speed at turning section 1 is higher than at the others 12 59 versus 8 94 9 28 and 8 17 respectively turning sections 2 4 correspond to the entrances of ports of lisbon setúbal and sines where the ship speed is limited due to the geophysical characteristics of restricted waterways from the speed distribution of tankers in turning section 1 fig 11a one can see that the average speed of tankers is slightly higher than the average speed of general ship types in turning section 1 a t test showed that the speed distribution of all ship types and tankers is well approximated by a normal distribution p value equal to 0 59 and 0 5 respectively in addition the standard deviation of the tankers speed is smaller than that of all ships it should be mentioned that the speed distribution at turning section 4 is not normally distributed the southbound ship route to the port of sines is dominated by tankers and near the port of sines there exists an anchoring area the travel behaviour of tankers in section 4 is more complex compared with that of ships in turning sections 2 and 3 the revealed ship trajectory data makes it possible to study the density of ships in the corresponding route in this study the density of a ship at a section simply refers to the number of ships at this section it should be mentioned that the estimation of density takes all collected historical ais data into consideration fig 12 shows the ship density distribution at each turning section according to fig 12a it can be found that 17 9 21 7 and 18 9 of ships encounter 3 5 other ships in section 1 respectively in section 2 and section 3 ships are less likely to encounter more than three ships 72 2 and 51 7 in section 2 and section 3 respectively in terms of environmental pollution tankers pose a high environmental risk as they carry large amounts of oil or toxic chemicals in this study the density distribution when a tanker is at turning section 1 is presented fig 12a also shows that it is more likely for a tanker to encounter three or four ships 30 and 23 3 respectively in turning section 1 the inbound ship traffic to the port of sines is dominated by tankers see table 2 71 2 of ships encounter only one or two ship in section 4 entrance of port sines which indicates that the entrance in the port of sines seems is less congested the speed distributions and density distribution of each section is presented above respectively in the following for the general traffic flow of all types of ships and traffic flow of tankers the mean speed under different traffic density level were investigated as shown in fig 13 it is seen that the density level did not significantly affect ship speed in addition the difference between minimum and maximum speed of mean speed distribution in section 2 and section 4 fig 13 are 1 9 knot and 2 16 knot the nearly flat curves imply that the speeds at these two sections are free flow speeds which indicate that these two sections do not suffer from serious traffic congestion 3 4 characteristics of the maritime traffic in the route legs as the port of sines is the main port on the atlantic seaboard of portugal due to its geophysical characteristics it is the main gateway to the energy supply of portugal natural gas coal oil and its derivatives in terms of environmental pollution tankers pose a high environmental risk as they carry large amounts of oil or toxic chemicals an example of an accident of this type that occurred close to the entrance of sines is described by sebastião and guedes soares 2006 while a more general description of pollution accidents in the portuguese coast can be found in gouveia and guedes soares 2010 a statistical analysis is performed to study the maritime traffic on the route passing southbound dangerous traffic lane to port of sines as tanker is the main ship type in this route as shown in fig 14 the ship route that passes the southbound dangerous traffic lane to port of sines is divided by two turning sections derived above in leg 1 ships move southward toward the tss off cape roca s southbound dangerous traffic lane then in turning section 1 ships turn east toward sines port in leg 2 fig 15 illustrates the speed and cog distributions of ships in the two legs in terms of speed distributions it is seen that most ships in this route sail at 12 15 knots 70 9 in leg 1 and 66 2 in leg 2 respectively fig 15b shows cog distributions at each leg obviously there are significant differences between the traffic in each leg one may notice two peaks in the histogram of cog which correspond to the two directions of the legs the lateral distribution reflects the spatial extension of the ship routes fig 16 shows the lateral distributions of the ship trajectories in the two legs on the x axis the zero value corresponds to the calculated route centreline a positive value for x means that the vessel sails to the starboard side of the route centreline the comparison of lateral distribution of leg 1 and leg 2 shows that the deviation of lateral distribution in leg 2 is larger which means that ship trajectories in leg 1 are more concentrated on the route centreline it is found that route width changes along the route fig 14 for example at the north part of leg 2 the route is narrow whereas at other locations the distribution over the route is relatively wide this indicates that the lateral distribution along the waterway needs to be investigated the route width is estimated according to trajectory spatial distribution along the ship route once the route centreline is derived the lateral distributions along legs 1 and 2 are calculated from the available ais data at every 16 and 5 nautical miles nm respectively as shown in fig 17 the leg lateral distribution is approximated by a normal distribution and then the 95 probability interval of the distribution is adopted as the route width the grey box indicates the 95 confidence interval estimated by the series of route widths in a given section according to fig 17a the route width estimated by ais data varies considerably the reason is that the uncertainty in ship trajectories varies along the route the route width distribution in leg 2 fig 17b indicates that the route become wider along the route from turning section 1 to turning section 4 an obvious change is observed from the first 5nm section to the second 5nm section restricted by the tss off cape roca traffic lane ships are convergence in the traffic route therefore the route width at leg 2 is narrow only 2800m in the first 5nm section the width of ship route increases steady from 20 nautical miles to 60 nautical miles along leg 2 and finally reaches at 18500 m 3 5 anomaly detection the characterization of ship behaviour within motion patterns based on historical ais data provides important information for maritime traffic surveillance in this study ship routes are characterized probabilistically and the motion of the ships is described by a series of gaussian distributions this normalcy representation supports anomaly detection of ship trajectories that deviate from the route behaviour ship trajectories can be outliers for different types of reasons ships may sail to irregular place turn to destination ahead or delayed of schedule and steering to the left or to the right of the main route followed by most of ships anomalies could also be the result of accidental situations of ships that lose control due to failure of its propulsion or course keeping equipment e g wu et al 2017 2018a as shown in fig 18 a a new ship is first associated to the route passing southbound dangerous traffic lane to the sines port based on the ship position it is assumed that the ship lateral position is normal distributed along the ship route and therefore the probability that the ship belongs to the route is calculated by the normal probability density distribution where u p is the lateral distance of point p and σ is the standard deviation of the lateral distribution at the current section then off route behaviour is detected by calculating the value of the gaussian distribution function at the ship lateral position if the value is below a threshold then the ship is detected as not following the route fig 18b shows the ship in route probability corresponding to its lateral position the grey area and red dash line demonstrate the main route and the route centreline followed by most of the ship trajectories the 95 probability interval of the lateral traffic distribution is adopted to define the boundaries of the waterway it can be seen that the probability decreases dramatically when the ship trajectory located out of the route the off route behaviour detection results suggest that the method is capable of detecting unexpected departures from regular movements however this detection method is a distance based approach which means that the velocity and acceleration of the ships are not taken into consideration 4 conclusions the proposed data mining method provides a relatively straightforward and unsupervised approach to determine maritime turning sections and to characterize the maritime traffic in each turning section the turning section is automatically identified using ship trajectory compression and turning point detection techniques and clustering methods in particular the trajectory compression dp algorithm is adopted for turning point detection and a density based clustering algorithm is applied for clustering these dispersed points into clusters the clusters of turning points forms turning sections of the route which benefits greatly from the previous compression step the turning section is the geographical area where the turning behaviour is frequently observed in this study the kernel density estimation method is applied to estimate the density area based on the identified turning points then relatively high density areas form turning sections of the ship route this method is applied to southbound ship trajectories passing the traffic separation scheme off cape roca to the ports of lisbon setúbal and sines four main turning sections have been identified at the exit of the tss off cape roca and along the three routes to lisbon setúbal and sines a statistical analysis of the maritime traffic at the turning sections shows that the ship type distribution depends on the route destination most cargo ships visit the ports of lisbon and setúbal whereas tankers dominate in the dangerous traffic lane of tss off cape roca and in the route to sines the speed distributions of the ships in each section reveal that ships sailed at higher speed in turning section 1 than in other sections in addition the average speed of tankers is slightly higher than the average speed of other ship types in addition according to the speed distributions divided by the density of ships in each section it is found that the density of ships does not significantly affect the ship speed tankers pose higher environmental risk and dominate the route passing southbound dangerous traffic lane of tss off cape roca to the port of sines therefore the characteristics of the maritime traffic in this route is further analysed two turning sections haven been identified dividing this route in two legs speed and cog distributions as well as lateral distributions of the ship trajectories have been derived and analysed from the available ais data the investigation of the lateral distribution in the two legs indicates that the ship trajectories in leg 1 are more concentrated on the route centreline compared with leg 2 the lateral distributions along the ship route show that the route width changes with the route location furthermore the uncertainty in the route width also varies along the route and a high variability on the ship trajectories is observed at the entrance of the port of sines the lateral distributions of the maritime traffic along the ship route characterize in a probabilistic manner the route centreline and the route spatial extension followed by most of the ship trajectories ship off route behaviour detection is then tested on an abnormal ship trajectory the ship is first assigned to a route ship route passing the southbound dangerous traffic lane to the sines port and off route behaviour is detected according to the lateral position probability defined by a gaussian distribution in this study the route width is considered as three standard deviations from the mean route and the off route detection threshold is set as the corresponding probability value however the choice of thresholds is a critical aspect of the detection strategy which should be further investigated author
