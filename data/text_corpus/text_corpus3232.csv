16160,influence of extreme hydrological events on water quality has been widely concerned for instance droughts can inhibit dissolved organic carbon doc exports or imports however the response relationship of doc to hydrological drought characteristics i e duration and severity requires more in depth research we propose an integrated framework for constructing validating and applying the response relationship model and investigate the capability of response model to simulate doc based on hydrological drought characteristics three headwater basins hp3a hp4 and hp6 with different drainage areas 9 28 122 80 ha and long term 40 year observed doc concentration and hydrometeorological data in harp lake catchment south central ontario southeastern canada are used to demonstrate the proposed framework run theory and variable drought thresholds vdts are used to identify hydrological drought characteristics and doc during hydrological drought is extracted based on the extracted hydrological drought characteristics and doc for one basin i e hp3a the response relationship model is constructed and validated and then applied to other two basins i e hp4 and hp6 three evaluation indicators coefficient of determination r 2 root mean square error rmse and mean absolute percentage error mape are served to test the goodness of fit performance of the response relationship model the results show that i annual doc concentration showed a significant a 0 01 increasing trend during 1978 2018 in the study basin ii during the hydrological drought the variation of temperature affected doc variation indirectly through direct influence on so4 variation iii the response sensitivity of doc to hydrologic process with different timescales is varying within a year namely there is a larger response sensitivity from march to may than in other months iv doc during the hydrological drought has a close and regular linear relationship with hydrological drought characteristics i e with the increase of drought duration and severity doc concentration also increases the relationship with drought duration is better than that of severity r 2 0 92 vs 0 35 v the response relationship

geochemical cycle freeman et al 2004 monteith et al 2007 rouhani et al 2021 changes in doc of river could affect climate change water ecosystem health human life and sustainable development of water resources bauer et al 2013 fenner et al 2021 hruska et al 2009 thrane et al 2014 drought is a complex and recurrent extreme climate phenomenon that occurs in all climatic regions griggs et al 2013 mishra and singh 2010 as an extreme hydrological event hydrological drought refers to a lack of water resources in the hydrological system and is characterized by abnormally low flow in river channels or low levels in lakes reservoirs or groundwater linsley et al 1982 wu et al 2017 2018 with serious impact on the ecosystem environment vegetation health and ecological safety aghakouchak et al 2021 ashraf et al 2017 bastos et al 2021 van loon 2015 developing a response relationship model of doc to hydrological drought characteristics to reveal their response patterns is very necessary however still remains challenging previous work highlighted the effects of droughts on doc migration and transformation as well as the possible physical mechanism blaurock et al 2021 freeman et al 2001 mehring et al 2013 worral and burt 2008 as an extreme and random hydrological event a hydrological drought can be described according to its characteristics such as duration i e time from start to end of drought severity e g cumulative streamflow deficit during the drought and intensity mean severity through the drought period mishra and singh 2010 wu et al 2017 2020 all of which are interdependent tu et al 2018 exploring the evolution of hydrological drought characteristics and its influencing mechanism as well as its impact on water resources safety have attracted much attention chang et al 2019 tu et al 2018 van loon 2015 wu et al 2018 wu et al 2021a from the perspective of water quality however there are few discussions on the relationship between hydrological drought characteristics and doc concentration ahmadi et al 2019 presented a framework to detect and characterize hydrological drought considering both streamflow and water quality changes and increased temperature decreased turbidity and lower dissolved oxygen were observed during hydrological droughts they indicated that it would take about two more months for water quality variables to recover from a drought following the hydrological drought termination doc is acknowledged to be on the increase with global or regional climate change worral and burt 2008 suggested that the reason for increase of doc was mainly the increases in air temperature changes in land management changes in ph and sulfate e g so4 changes in runoff increases in atmospheric co2 and decreases in acidic deposition as well as increases in droughts frequency the doc is relatively low during drought to non drought period the release of doc is inhibited due to the low river flow but it flared up again after droughts clark et al 2005 worral and burt 2008 mehring et al 2013 found that the interannual drought length governs doc dynamics and longer drought periods not only reduced downstream doc export but also led to higher doc concentrations after droughts e g the doc may rise suddenly in re wetting period a recent study from blaurock et al 2021 also found that a disproportionally high contribution to the total doc exports of the upper catchment during rain events following a long dry period they attributed this to the low hydrological connectivity in the lower catchment during drought which inhibited doc mobilization although these previous studies provide some hints for understanding the evolution of doc during the droughts the question of can we simulate the doc concentration based on hydrological drought characteristics still does not get a valid answer furthermore the measured doc and corresponding hydrometeorological variables were usually used for a relatively short period of time series i e less than 20 years in previous studies whereas a memory of longer than 30 years is quite necessary from a statistical perspective especially in identifying hydrological drought characteristics mahmoudi et al 2019 this is because if the time length for the interested variables is short the characteristics of the identified certain variable may not be statistically significant thus a study based on long term data is needed a satisfactory simulation doc during the drought is vital in planning water quantity and water quality management based on hydrological drought characteristics as well as in prediction of changes in carbon storage worrall and burt 2005 mathematical modeling including regression models birkel et al 2017 carter et al 2012 lumped models dick et al 2014 wang et al 2020 and physically based models dusek et al 2019 rouhani et al 2021 xu et al 2020 zhang et al 2016 are frequently used to simulate doc dynamics modeling also offers a unique opportunity to reveal the effects causing shifts in long term patterns as well as to provide a framework for testing of hypotheses such as preferential transport during changes of hydrometeorological variables and their controls on doc turnover dusek et al 2017 2019 xu et al 2020 for the lumped and physically based models however they involve many issues flood control drought control regional water demand balance etc in eco hydrological applications fu et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 2020 requiring modelers to build models that can accurately simulate different flow phases e g high middle and low flow delorit et al 2017 fowler et al 2018 lan et al 2020 nevertheless despite the continuous efforts of many researchers it is actually very difficult to achieve this simulation goal gupta et al 2009 lan et al 2020 for example the hydro ecological models are generally suffered from a bad simulation and prediction performance during low flow periods fu et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 thus impede the usage of these models to simulate the response of the river ecosystems to the changes in hydrological drought although the statistical model lacks physical mechanism it may reasonably reveal the response relationship of river ecosystems patterns to hydrologic processes as long as there are enough samples hydrological drought indices are commonly used to identify and characterize hydrological drought characteristics mishra and singh 2010 broadly hydrological drought indices can be grouped into standardized indices and non standardized threshold based approach wu et al 2020 the drought severity identified from standardized indices is expressed in relative terms i e using a non dimensional standardized value which does not provide any explicit information on the volume of water deficit during hydrological droughts for water resources applications the absolute deficit relative to the normal condition is fundamental to risk assessment and decision making van loon 2015 two types of threshold based approaches have been used in the literature fixed and variable van loon et al 2019 the fixed drought threshold fdt is more suitable for areas with less climate variability throughout the year whereas the variable drought thresholds vdts are more practical for locations with considerable seasonal climate variability the objective of this study thus is to construct the response relationship model of doc to hydrological drought characteristics and use it to simulate the doc concentration during the hydrological drought this paper focuses on the following three aspects i reveal the long term trends of doc and their possible driving mechanisms ii construct the response relationship model of doc to hydrological drought characteristics iii investigate the capability to simulate doc based on hydrological drought characteristics to achieve the above aims this study took three sub basins hp3a hp4 and hp6 with different areas 9 28 ha 19 60 ha and 122 80 ha in harp lake catchment south central ontario southeastern canada as a case study area the long term measured data including monthly doc concentration and monthly hydrometeorological data streamflow precipitation and temperature during 1978 2018 were used to demonstrate our research objective and methods the remainder of the paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the research basins methodology and details of the analysis approaches the key results and discussion are presented in sections 3 and 4 section 5 exhibits the main conclusions of this study 2 methods 2 1 harp lake catchment the harp lake catchment 542 ha located in south central ontario southeastern canada fig 1 was selected to demonstrate our study the harp lake catchment is one of eight long term experimental sites monitored by the dorset environmental science center desc ontario ministry of environment conservation and parks meteorology hydrology and water quality data have been collected since late 1970s three sub basins i e hp3a hp4 and hp6 with different areas from small to large 9 28 ha 19 6 ha and 122 8 ha respectively were selected for this study the mainly used data information for this study is showing in table 1 the monthly doc concentration and streamflow data from july 1978 to december 2018 were used here the long time average of monthly doc streamflow during study periods in hp3a hp4 and hp6 are 3 08 0 33 mg l 3 65 3 12 l s mean standard deviation 6 51 1 05 mg l 20 75 17 26 l s and 7 97 2 91 mg l 1 96 1 73 l s respectively table 1 the average monthly temperature in the study catchment within a year differs from 4 98 c to 25 38 c 1978 2018 the average temperature in january february and december is below zero and above zero in other months monthly mean precipitation varies from 60 81 mm to 104 83 mm 1978 2018 with a long time average of 86 19 mm there was about one third of annual precipitation falling as snow fu and yao 2015 and snowpack appears from december to april as temperature rising in march spring snow melt occurred from march to may and contributes about 50 of annual runoff in the harp lake catchment hrycik et al 2021 here the monthly precipitation temperature and sulfate i e so4 were used for revealing the change trends of doc all the data used have undergone strict quality control and have been applied for other related topics research james et al 2022 fu et al 2014 imtiazy et al 2020 yao et al 2014 2016 zhang et al 2016 2 2 integrated framework the integrated framework contains three parts as follows part 1 long term trends of interest variables non parametric trend test i e mann kendall mk and linear trend test approaches were both served to examine the trends for annual and monthly variables mk test method is used because it is less disturbed by outliers mann 1945 kendall 1976 the slope of linear model can generally quantitatively characterize the rise or decline of interest variables part 2 response sensitivity of doc to streamflow at different timescales before extracting hydrological drought characteristics we need to determine the response sensitivity of doc to streamflow due to the cumulative effect of doc in the river birkel et al 2017 dawson et al 2011 mehring et al 2013 pearson correlation coefficient pcc is widely used to confirm the sensitivity for the response of hydrological process to meteorological process in previous studies apurv et al 2017 barker et al 2016 huang et al 2017 hellwig et al 2020 here it was served to examine the response sensitivity of doc to streamflow at different timescales the moving average window was used to determine different timescales of streamflow for example 2 month of moving average window represents two months timescale of streamflow i e 2 month and so on different timescales of streamflow reflect different hydrologic information to clearly describe the response sensitivity of doc to streamflow and identify the characteristics of hydrological drought events the pcc analysis method was used to identify the timescale of moving averaged streamflow having a maximum correlation tmax with monthly doc hellwig et al 2020 we then extracted characteristics of hydrological drought events at the identified streamflow timescale part 3 response relationship model of doc to hydrological drought characteristics based on the results obtained from part 2 the hydrological drought characteristics including duration and severity were identified according to vdts method van loon 2015 and the so called run theory yevjevich 1967 the definitions of hydrological drought characteristics and run theory are described in the following section then we used the autoregressive integrated moving average arima model box and jenkins 1976 to construct the response relationship model of doc to hydrological drought duration and severity based on cross validation method shao et al 1997 in the execution of cross validation method 2 3 samples of identified hydrological drought events were regarded as training set and remaining 1 3 samples were deemed to test set three evaluation indicators coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse and mean absolute percentage error mape are used to determine the goodness of fit performance of response model among three sub basins in the harp lake catchment statistical samples for hp3a basin were used to construct and validate the response relationship model and the obtained optimal arima model with the same parameters no added or reduced ones but different regression coefficients were applied to hp4 and hp6 basins to verify the applicability of models fig 2 shows the schematic flowchart for the integrated framework the details of the methods used here are described below 2 3 identifying hydrological drought characteristics based on vdts and run theory the framework presented in fig 2 can be served with both vdts and fdts depending on the climate features of research regions here vdts method was used to identify hydrological drought events because the climate of harp lake catchment has obvious seasonal difference zhang et al 2016 and the vdts method can be used to reflect the drought characteristics in a region with obvious seasonal climate features van loon et al 2019 the procedures for determining the vdts are as follows i the monthly streamflow records are ranked separately for each month i e from january to december ii the corresponding threshold level e g from q70 to q90 for each month is examined according to a particular percentile of the streamflow duration curve cumulative frequency of streamflow is from high to low as recommended by van loon 2015 q80 threshold for each month is recommended because it is widely used to identify hydrological drought events van loon 2015 van loon et al 2019 when the hydrological drought events were identified the hydrological drought characteristics including duration d and severity s were then extracted based on run theory yevjevich 1967 according to the rules of the run theory if the streamflow series in a certain month is below the threshold the month is regarded as a drought month if the streamflow series in a certain period of time remains below the threshold this period is regarded as a hydrological drought event the d is defined as the period from the beginning to the end of the drought month the cumulative value of the difference between the streamflow and the drought threshold during d is defined as drought severity s the average s during d is regarded as the drought intensity i wu et al 2018 the hydrological drought events with a minimum duration of 1 month were extracted for more drought samples 2 4 statistical analysis 2 4 1 temporal trends test mk trend test method mann 1945 kendall 1976 is recommended by the world meteorological organization as a nonparametric approach for detecting the trends of long term interest variables the significance level i e a of mk test for interest variable change trend is set as 0 05 and 0 01 in this study and the corresponding mk statistical values are 1 96 a 0 05 and 2 38 a 0 01 respectively mk statistical value being larger than 0 but less than 1 96 means an insignificant increasing trend for interest variables when mk statistical value is between 1 96 and 2 38 it means a significant increasing trend mk statistical value being larger than 2 38 represents a very significant increasing trend for interest variables when mk statistical value is less than 0 but large than 1 96 it means an insignificant decreasing trend for interest variables and so on besides the slope of linear model for interest variables was also determined here because it can quantify the specific value of an increase or decrease in a certain variable e g the amount of change per 10 years as mentioned above 2 4 2 response sensitivity of doc to different timescales of streamflow pearson correlation coefficient pcc method silva et al 2016 was used to obtain response sensitivity of monthly doc to different timescales of streamflow this approach was motivated by the fact that the cumulative of doc concentration response to the hydrologic processes significantly differ among timescales birkel et al 2017 dawson et al 2011 mehring et al 2013 in addition to clearly describe the response relationship of doc to hydrological drought characteristics it is necessary to confirm the response sensitivity of doc to streamflow the pcc method was used to determine the correlation between monthly doc and different timescales of streamflow for each month and the maximum correlation tmax for a specific timescale was selected and regarded as a very sensitive one for the response of doc to streamflow to calculate tmax by the pcc method we used moving average window method to obtain different timescales of streamflow e g n month where n stands for the different moving window in months e g ranging from 1 to 12 months the monthly doc time series within a year was cross correlated with each of the n month of streamflow under corresponding month time series the n with the largest pcc value was selected as tmax and appropriate timescale for the streamflow time series is further selected to identify hydrological drought events based on vdts hellwig et al 2020 2 4 3 construction validation and application of response relationship model 1 construction the response relationship of doc to hydrological drought characteristics was constructed by using arima model using data of hp3a basin the arima model has been widely used in the financial field to forecast the future development of economy or enterprises jiang et al 2021 lam et al 2009 it has also been used in drought forecasting han et al 2010 mishr and desai 2005 because of the flexibility and rigor in every step of the model construction for an appropriate model the basic idea of arima model is that if the behavior of a variable in a time series is random and non stationary a certain mathematical model is used to approximate this variable sequence box and jenkins 1976 the doc and hydrological drought characteristics have random and non stationary properties and there is a certain relationship between them in some extent there are three parameters in arima model i e p d and q which respectively represent the autoregressive item p the number of differences that was made when the variable time series becomes stationary d and the numbers of moving average q as the i can be obtained from the ratio of s and d we just set the d and s as the independent variable in the arima model and the doc during the hydrological drought is regarded as dependent variable the detail process for calculating arima model can be found in lam et al 2009 all arima modeling processes are performed in ibm spss statistics the best fit arima model was identified based on the evaluation indicators namely r 2 rmse and mape the equation for r 2 rmse and mape are described as follows 1 r 2 i 1 n o i o i 1 n s i s i 1 n o i o i 1 n s i s 2 2 2 r m s e i 1 n o i s i 2 n 3 m a p e i 1 n o i s i o i 100 n where o and s represent observed and simulated values i e doc respectively i and n represent the sample number and total numbers the closer r 2 is to 1 and the closer rmse and mape are to 0 the optimal validation model is considered the model with the highest r 2 the lowest rmse and mape were selected as the optimal response relationship model 2 validation a cross validation is a model validation approach for examining a predictive model using another independent data set that is not used in model construction process shao et al 1997 the sample statistics of doc and d and s for each hydrological drought event were first divided into multiple training and test set groups 2 3 of the samples were used to the training test in the model construction and the remaining 1 3 samples were regarded as the test set for cross validation then we used the r 2 rmse and mape to evaluate the goodness of fit performance of response relationship model in the test set there are multiple group values of simulated doc because the statistics samples i e hydrological drought characteristics are divided into different groups the model with the best results of the evaluation indicators was selected to represent the optimal model 3 application the optimal model obtained from the construction and validation steps with the same arima model parameters but different multiple regression coefficients were applied to another two sub basins i e hp4 and hp6 to demonstrate the applicability of our proposed methodology also the r 2 rmse and mape were determined to examine the goodness of fit performance of the optimal response model in the hp4 and hp6 the integrated framework presented in this study therefore includes construction validation and application of response relationship model of doc to hydrological drought characteristics 3 results 3 1 long term annual trends of interest variables the annual doc exhibits a significant p 0 01 increasing trend over the past 41 years for three sub basins in the harp lake catchment fig 3 however the annual streamflow shows insignificant increasing trend p 0 1 for the hp6 basin annual doc and streamflow have increased 0 73 mg l and 0 05 l s per decade over the past years for the hp4 basin annual doc and streamflow have increased 0 34 mg l and 0 26 l s and increased 0 11 mg l and 0 08 l s in hp3a basin respectively the mk test for the annual doc and streamflow trends is similar to the results of linear trend test at hp3a and hp6 sub basins fig 4 that is giving a very significant increase trend mk statistics 1 96 for doc but insignificant increase trend mk statistics 1 96 for streamflow however the change trends for annual streamflow in hp4 shows an insignificant decreasing trend from the mk statistics mk statistics 0 28 it is not consistent with the linear trend test for the hp4 basin as the changes of annual streamflow shows an insignificant increase trend when using the linear trend test checking the annual streamflow of hp4 in fig 3 there is an outlier 43 03 l s in 2014 and the outlier is more than double the average of annual streamflow 20 67 l s during 1978 2018 thus it is necessary to combine mk and linear trend tests to discuss the change trends of interest variables 3 2 response sensitivity of doc to streamflow processes the correlations between monthly doc and streamflow at different timescales within a year are different fig 5 a 1 c 1 for hp3a there is a strong positive correlation between doc and streamflow of shorter timescales for march to july fig 5 a 3 and the positive correlation extends to longer timescale e g 12 month resulting a positive correlation between doc and streamflow of all timescales 1 month to 12 month fig 5 a 1 for march to july the maximum average correlation between doc and different timescales of streamflow for hp3a basin is focused on 1 month timescale fig 5 a 2 meanwhile there is a positive correlation at shorter timescale for october to january fig 5 a 1 for hp4 basin there is a strong positive correlation between doc and streamflow for march to may fig 5 b 3 and the positive correlation extends to all timescales of streamflow 1 month to 12month fig 5 b 1 however the pcc values for other months and other timescales are negative or close to zero in hp4 basin the maximum average correlation for hp4 basin is focused on 1 month timescale fig 5 b 2 for hp6 basin a weak correlation is seen between doc and streamflow of different timescales fig 5 c 1 except for march to june with 1 to 3 month timescales fig 5 c 2 and c 3 also the maximum average correlation for hp6 basin is focused on 1 month timescale fig 5 c 2 it means that the response sensitivity of doc to streamflow is very different from month to month for three sub basins on the whole there is a relatively high positive correlation between doc and 1 month timescale of streamflow at each of three sub basins fig 5 a 2 b 2 and c 2 although the response sensitivity is very different in different months within a year over any sub basin the response process of monthly doc to streamflow processes is reflected in one month in general thus for constructing the response relationship model of doc to hydrological drought characteristics well and unifying the timescales and comparing results the monthly 1 month scale streamflow for identifying hydrological drought events was adopted 3 3 response relationship model of doc to hydrological drought characteristics 3 3 1 identification of hydrological drought events using the run theory method based on vdts i e q80 method the characteristics i e d and s of each hydrological drought event for hp3a hp4 and hp6 basins were generated shown in fig 6 the upper part of each figure in fig 6 shows the cumulative doc during the hydrological drought the lower part displays the d i e x axis length in each hydrological drought and absolute s for each hydrological drought event the d of hydrological drought with larger than 3 months was summarized in table 2 forty eight forty nine and fifty one hydrological drought events were extracted by the run theory and vdts methods at the hp3a hp4 and hp6 during 1978 2018 respectively as seen from table 2 for the hp3a the most severe three hydrological drought events with long d happened during 1989 07 1989 12 1991 05 1991 09 and 1998 04 1998 12 among which the longest d was from april 1998 to december 1998 with d of 9 months the corresponding absolute value of s was 6 01 l s for the hp4 the most severe three hydrological drought events with long d happened during 1987 04 1987 09 1989 07 1989 12 and 1998 04 1998 12 among which the longest d was from april 1998 to december 1998 with d of 9 months the corresponding absolute value of s was 21 31 l s for the hp6 the most severe three hydrological drought events with long d happened during 1997 08 1997 12 1998 04 1998 08 and 2002 09 2003 01 all of them are 5 months d but the largest s among them was from april 1998 to august 1998 note that the longest d in hp6 basin is just 5 months and less than the longest d i e 9 months in other two basins this is because the streamflow in september 1998 is higher than drought threshold and the hydrological drought events during 1998 was temporarily interrupted the streamflow in october and november 1998 was below the drought threshold the pattern of cumulative doc during the hydrological drought is consistent with most hydrological drought events fig 6 namely the larger the cumulative doc during the hydrological drought is the larger the values of d and absolute s are and vice versa the reason is that the doc has a cumulative effect during droughts which is related to drought inhibiting doc export clark et al 2005 worral and burt 2008 fig 7 shows the linear relationship between doc and d or s for three sub basins with a close linear relationship between doc and d s the smallest r 2 is 0 19 and the highest r 2 is 0 97 as the d s increases so does doc the fitting lines between doc and d s are generally located within the 95 prediction band of the corresponding linear functions it indicates that the doc during the hydrological drought can be simulated based on hydrological drought characteristics fig 7 also shows that the correlation between doc and d is higher than that between doc and s i e average of r 2 is 0 92 vs 0 35 which means that the effect of d on doc is larger than s 3 3 2 construction and validation of response relationship model for hp3a basin there are thirty one models were constructed based on arima model method and cross validation rule noted that the d s and doc concentration during the hydrological drought had non seasonal features and neither their auto correlation function acf nor partial auto correlation function pacf had drag tail properties figs s1 s6 after repeating tests the determined values of three parameters for arima are 2 0 and 2 for p d and q values respectively the values of evaluation indicators r 2 rmse and mape for test set samples are summarized in fig 8 fig 8 shows that each evaluation indicator achieves satisfactory results in all model groups e g r 2 0 78 rmse 1 44 and mape 25 the highest r 2 the lowest rmse and mape values for the goodness of fit performance between observed and simulated doc occur in group 2 and thus the response relationship model in the group 2 is chosen as the optimal response relationship model fig 9 shows the simulated and observed hydrographs of doc values for construction and validation samples in the hp3a basin the simulated doc was calculated based on optimal response relationship model i e y 2 56 1 0 07 2 0 13 y x 1 and x 2 represents doc d and s respectively the simulations fit observations very well the values of r 2 rmse and mape for the construction validation samples set are 0 99 0 87 0 75 0 86 and 10 43 13 69 3 3 3 application of response relationship model the same parameters for arima model but with different multiple regression coefficients were further applied to simulate doc in the hp4 and hp6 basins using the corresponding identified hydrological drought characteristics of two sub basins the goodness of fit performance for the simulated doc and observed doc values in hp4 and hp6 basins are exhibited in fig 10 the response relationship models for hp4 and hp6 basins are y 6 25 1 0 23 2 0 83 and y 8 21 1 0 72 2 1 75 y x 1 and x 2 represents doc d and s respectively there is a good performance for the simulated doc in hp4 and hp6 basins fig 10 all simulated and observed doc samples are distributed near the 1 1 line and most of samples are located in 95 prediction band the values of r 2 rmse and mape for the hp4 hp6 basin are 0 97 0 85 2 01 4 72 and 3 62 15 59 although the goodness of fit performance for simulated doc in hp6 basin is lower than that of hp4 the simulations fit observations well in general thus we think that the constructed response relationship model of doc to hydrological drought characteristics based on our proposed integrated framework can be used to simulate doc concentration during the hydrological drought and it may be applied to other basins of other regions with proper configuration 4 discussion the long term annual doc series i e 1978 2018 showed a significant a 0 05 increasing trend in harp lake catchment several hypotheses were used to explain the observed increases hruska et al 2009 worral and burt 2008 for example increasing temperature leading to higher production of humic and fulvic acids in soils and peat lands was initially proposed as the cause of observed doc increases freeman et al 2001 other hypotheses based on climatic changes were connected with rising co2 in the atmosphere and increasing net primary production freeman et al 2004 fenner et al 2021 imtiazy et al 2020 or increasing amounts of precipitating and runoff blaurock et al 2021 evans et al 2005 hongve et al 2004 warner and saros 2019 furthermore more aerobic conditions in drier and warmer peats were also proposed as the driver of doc increases in peaty soils evans et al 2006 hruska et al 2009 monteith et al 2007 however the forcing mechanism for doc variation is very complex in different areas with different timescales clark et al 2005 freeman et al 2004 here we further checked the cross correlation among doc streamflow precipitation temperature and so4 during the hydrological drought based on pcc method as shown in fig 11 the correlations between doc and streamflow precipitation so4 were negative but positive with temperature in which the correlations with streamflow and so4 were significant a 0 05 additionally the correlation between temperature and so4 was significantly negative a 0 01 in hp3a and hp4 a 0 05 in hp6 thus we infer that the variation of doc during the hydrological drought was influenced by variation of streamflow and so4 directly and also influenced by temperature variation indirectly despite the correlation between doc and temperature is positive in all three sub basins just the correlation in hp6 passed significance test a 0 01 however the correlation between temperature and so4 in all three sub basins are significant a 0 05 thus the changes in streamflow can revise doc changes during the hydrological drought directly the changes in temperature can lead to so4 change directly and may lead to doc changes indirectly the temperature has been proposed as a driver of changes in doc in many rivers or lakes due to its effects on enzymatic activity we would assert that temperature change could also be driving the trend in doc indirectly that we have observed in our study area similar to the conclusions reached by other researchers clark et al 2006 dawson et al 2011 fenner et al 2021 here we just analyzed the possible forcing mechanism of doc variation during the hydrological drought as the variation of doc in different areas and different timescales are very complex clark et al 2005 freeman et al 2004 further research is needed in our next work there is a different response sensitivity of doc to streamflow processes for different months within a year at each of three sub basins and also different among sub basins this is related to the local seasonality of climate streamflow and doc export in the study area for example the monthly streamflow is relatively high and floods are easy to occur in spring due to snowmelt hrycik et al 2021 fu and yao 2015 zhang et al 2016 however the streamflow is relatively low in summer and fall as a result doc is rapidly exported in the spring during the snowmelt floods and accumulated again in the summer as the flow is low thus doc in spring from march to may is more sensitive to streamflow process than in other seasons fig 5 the correlation coefficients between temperature and streamflow precipitation is negative fig 11 indicating that higher temperature may lead to less flow and precipitation in harp lake catchment this may help to explain the seasonal difference of response sensitivity of doc to streamflow within a year moreover the 1 month timescale of streamflow was selected as the optimal timescale to confirm the drought threshold for each month and extract hydrological drought events based on the results in fig 5 a 2 b 2 and c 2 in general although the response sensitivity of doc to different timescales of streamflow varied in each month most of maximum correlations between doc and different timescales of streamflow focused on 1 month especially at hp3a and hp4 sub basin thus for unification of the timescale and comparison of the results the 1 month timescale was finally selected because if different timescales are selected for each month it will not only cause difficulty in matching drought threshold on timescale but also cause failure to reflect the drought duration feature e g drought continuity for example if the 2 month timescale is used for identifying hydrological drought in march but 5 month timescale is used for april it will cause the characteristics of extracted hydrological drought events being not comparable especially for drought severity this is because the cumulative average moving window method was used to determine the different timescales of streamflow the 2 month and 5 month timescale represent two and five consecutive months of cumulative streamflow shortage respectively although using the correlation method to determine the response of a certain variable to hydrometeorological process still exits many challenges shi et al 2022 it is a robust approach choice huang et al 2017 hellwig et al 2020 wu et al 2021b the response of doc to streamflow in hp3a basin is more sensitive i e the average of pcc value in hp3a is larger than that of hp4 and hp6 to streamflow than in hp4 and hp6 basins we suspect that the first reason may be that hp4 and hp6 basins have more proportion of wetland or beaver pond area such wetlands or beaver ponds in hp4 and hp6 basins account for 11 and 4 5 of their total basin area but just account for 0 7 in hp3a basin lane et al 2020 richardson 2011 the second possible reason is that there are two households near the upstream of hp6 monitoring site whose domestic sewage may interfere with the natural response process of doc to streamflow processes because the hp6 has smaller basin area but higher doc concentration compared to other two basins fig 3 using the arima model and integrated framework in our study the response relationship model of doc to hydrological drought characteristics were constructed and the response relationship of doc to hydrological drought characteristics can be described clearly figs 9 and 10 with the increase of drought d and s doc concentration increased the relationship between doc and hydrological drought d is greater than that of s fig 7 which means that the doc concentration during hydrological drought depends more on the drought d rather than the drought s although previous studies have reported the possible relationship between doc and droughts or low flow e g blaurock et al 2021 clark et al 2005 2006 mehring et al 2013 worral and burt 2008 ritson et al 2017 they did not specifically explore the detailed response relationship of doc to hydrological drought characteristics i e d and s we presented an integrated framework fig 2 for constructing verifying and applying the response relationship model and achieved good application results figs 9 and 10 there are four advantages of the proposed integrated framework i the correlation analysis method i e pcc is used to detect the response sensitivity of doc to streamflow processes under different timescales the correlation analysis can be used to identify the timescales of streamflow most aligned with the monthly doc concentration this approach facilitates the identification of characteristics of hydrological drought events matching the doc concentration well on the one hand fig 6 on the other hand it can be used to detect the response sensitivity of doc to streamflow processes fig 5 ii the vdts combined with run theory are used to identify hydrological drought events and their characteristics which can identify the actual hydrological drought events well iii the arima model combined with the cross validation methods are served to construct and confirm the optimal response relationship model of doc to hydrological drought characteristics minimizing the uncertainty of response relationship model since the d s and doc concentration during the hydrological drought have non seasonal features and neither their acf nor pacf has drag tail characteristics figs s1 s6 thus the d value for the arima was set to 0 although the constructed response relationship models are multivariate linear regression finally the doc concentration during the hydrological drought can be simulated well based on the arima principle fig 9 iv although the presented integrated framework is just used to detect the response relationship of doc to hydrological drought characteristics here it can be also used to examine the response relationship of doc or other water quality elements to other drought types i e meteorological agricultural and ecological droughts the presented trials provided a perspective for improving our understanding of the relationship between doc and hydrological drought and simulating doc during hydrological drought the approach however has certain limitations for example how to reveal the impact of natural and human activities on doc changes and distinguish the different impacts of them on doc change needs further in depth research for the harp lake catchment the driving mechanism of changes in doc and the relationship with the migration and transformation of other chemical elements on land also need to be further discussed despite the response relationship model of doc to hydrological drought characteristics constructed by our proposed integrated framework applied well in the study catchment the model parameters for other basins of other regions need to calibrate the influence of droughts on the variation of doc in different climate areas and different timescales are very complex which also still need further study for example how droughts with different intensities e g different return periods effects on doc variation remains unclear in future research we will consider these limitations and improve the proposed framework for the determinations of driving mechanism of doc change and predict it better 5 conclusions this study presented an integrated framework for constructing validating and applying the response relationship model of doc to hydrological drought characteristics also the response sensitivity of doc to streamflow processes and possible driving mechanism for the variation of doc during the hydrological drought were revealed the framework was carried out for three headwater steams with long term measured data in harp lake catchment south central ontario southeastern canada we have shown the following i there is a clear relationship by which doc concentration responds to hydrological drought characteristics with the increase of drought duration and severity doc concentration also increased this response relationship was better understood by establishing the multiple regression model between doc and hydrological drought duration and severity from which the doc concentration during the hydrological drought can be simulated or predicted based on drought duration and severity variables ii the impact of drought duration on doc is larger than that of drought severity namely the cumulative doc during the hydrological drought depends more on the length of drought duration rather than drought severity iii for harp lake catchment the response process of doc concentration to different timescales of streamflow process varied during a year in which the response sensitivity is more obvious from march to may than other months due to the specific climate and hydrology features the variation of doc concentration during the hydrological drought is significant a 0 05 related to the variation of streamflow negative and so4 negative directly but significantly with the variation of temperature indirectly in other words the variation of temperature affected doc variation indirectly through influence on so4 variation during the hydrological drought despite the doc formation and conversion mechanisms during the hydrological drought are complex and there are still many challenges in doc prediction based on extreme hydrological events the results of this study indicate a certain possibility for simulating doc under the premise of hydrological drought predictability iv the multiple regression models with two parameters can be used to describe the response relationship between doc concentration and hydrological drought characteristics its rationality and applicability need to be further discussed because physical characteristics and human activities interact differently with doc and droughts in different catchments the results and improved doc predictability should be helpful to improve the implementation of a water quality safety early warning and are expected to provide additional information for policymaker to select appropriate water and ecological security strategies during the droughts with the global warming and the acceleration of hydrological cycle increase of extreme hydrological events our results suggest that more attention should be paid to water quality and ecological security issues caused by water pollution and extreme

16160,influence of extreme hydrological events on water quality has been widely concerned for instance droughts can inhibit dissolved organic carbon doc exports or imports however the response relationship of doc to hydrological drought characteristics i e duration and severity requires more in depth research we propose an integrated framework for constructing validating and applying the response relationship model and investigate the capability of response model to simulate doc based on hydrological drought characteristics three headwater basins hp3a hp4 and hp6 with different drainage areas 9 28 122 80 ha and long term 40 year observed doc concentration and hydrometeorological data in harp lake catchment south central ontario southeastern canada are used to demonstrate the proposed framework run theory and variable drought thresholds vdts are used to identify hydrological drought characteristics and doc during hydrological drought is extracted based on the extracted hydrological drought characteristics and doc for one basin i e hp3a the response relationship model is constructed and validated and then applied to other two basins i e hp4 and hp6 three evaluation indicators coefficient of determination r 2 root mean square error rmse and mean absolute percentage error mape are served to test the goodness of fit performance of the response relationship model the results show that i annual doc concentration showed a significant a 0 01 increasing trend during 1978 2018 in the study basin ii during the hydrological drought the variation of temperature affected doc variation indirectly through direct influence on so4 variation iii the response sensitivity of doc to hydrologic process with different timescales is varying within a year namely there is a larger response sensitivity from march to may than in other months iv doc during the hydrological drought has a close and regular linear relationship with hydrological drought characteristics i e with the increase of drought duration and severity doc concentration also increases the relationship with drought duration is better than that of severity r 2 0 92 vs 0 35 v the response relationship

mishra and singh 2010 as an extreme hydrological event hydrological drought refers to a lack of water resources in the hydrological system and is characterized by abnormally low flow in river channels or low levels in lakes reservoirs or groundwater linsley et al 1982 wu et al 2017 2018 with serious impact on the ecosystem environment vegetation health and ecological safety aghakouchak et al 2021 ashraf et al 2017 bastos et al 2021 van loon 2015 developing a response relationship model of doc to hydrological drought characteristics to reveal their response patterns is very necessary however still remains challenging previous work highlighted the effects of droughts on doc migration and transformation as well as the possible physical mechanism blaurock et al 2021 freeman et al 2001 mehring et al 2013 worral and burt 2008 as an extreme and random hydrological event a hydrological drought can be described according to its characteristics such as duration i e time from start to end of drought severity e g cumulative streamflow deficit during the drought and intensity mean severity through the drought period mishra and singh 2010 wu et al 2017 2020 all of which are interdependent tu et al 2018 exploring the evolution of hydrological drought characteristics and its influencing mechanism as well as its impact on water resources safety have attracted much attention chang et al 2019 tu et al 2018 van loon 2015 wu et al 2018 wu et al 2021a from the perspective of water quality however there are few discussions on the relationship between hydrological drought characteristics and doc concentration ahmadi et al 2019 presented a framework to detect and characterize hydrological drought considering both streamflow and water quality changes and increased temperature decreased turbidity and lower dissolved oxygen were observed during hydrological droughts they indicated that it would take about two more months for water quality variables to recover from a drought following the hydrological drought termination doc is acknowledged to be on the increase with global or regional climate change worral and burt 2008 suggested that the reason for increase of doc was mainly the increases in air temperature changes in land management changes in ph and sulfate e g so4 changes in runoff increases in atmospheric co2 and decreases in acidic deposition as well as increases in droughts frequency the doc is relatively low during drought to non drought period the release of doc is inhibited due to the low river flow but it flared up again after droughts clark et al 2005 worral and burt 2008 mehring et al 2013 found that the interannual drought length governs doc dynamics and longer drought periods not only reduced downstream doc export but also led to higher doc concentrations after droughts e g the doc may rise suddenly in re wetting period a recent study from blaurock et al 2021 also found that a disproportionally high contribution to the total doc exports of the upper catchment during rain events following a long dry period they attributed this to the low hydrological connectivity in the lower catchment during drought which inhibited doc mobilization although these previous studies provide some hints for understanding the evolution of doc during the droughts the question of can we simulate the doc concentration based on hydrological drought characteristics still does not get a valid answer furthermore the measured doc and corresponding hydrometeorological variables were usually used for a relatively short period of time series i e less than 20 years in previous studies whereas a memory of longer than 30 years is quite necessary from a statistical perspective especially in identifying hydrological drought characteristics mahmoudi et al 2019 this is because if the time length for the interested variables is short the characteristics of the identified certain variable may not be statistically significant thus a study based on long term data is needed a satisfactory simulation doc during the drought is vital in planning water quantity and water quality management based on hydrological drought characteristics as well as in prediction of changes in carbon storage worrall and burt 2005 mathematical modeling including regression models birkel et al 2017 carter et al 2012 lumped models dick et al 2014 wang et al 2020 and physically based models dusek et al 2019 rouhani et al 2021 xu et al 2020 zhang et al 2016 are frequently used to simulate doc dynamics modeling also offers a unique opportunity to reveal the effects causing shifts in long term patterns as well as to provide a framework for testing of hypotheses such as preferential transport during changes of hydrometeorological variables and their controls on doc turnover dusek et al 2017 2019 xu et al 2020 for the lumped and physically based models however they involve many issues flood control drought control regional water demand balance etc in eco hydrological applications fu et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 2020 requiring modelers to build models that can accurately simulate different flow phases e g high middle and low flow delorit et al 2017 fowler et al 2018 lan et al 2020 nevertheless despite the continuous efforts of many researchers it is actually very difficult to achieve this simulation goal gupta et al 2009 lan et al 2020 for example the hydro ecological models are generally suffered from a bad simulation and prediction performance during low flow periods fu et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 thus impede the usage of these models to simulate the response of the river ecosystems to the changes in hydrological drought although the statistical model lacks physical mechanism it may reasonably reveal the response relationship of river ecosystems patterns to hydrologic processes as long as there are enough samples hydrological drought indices are commonly used to identify and characterize hydrological drought characteristics mishra and singh 2010 broadly hydrological drought indices can be grouped into standardized indices and non standardized threshold based approach wu et al 2020 the drought severity identified from standardized indices is expressed in relative terms i e using a non dimensional standardized value which does not provide any explicit information on the volume of water deficit during hydrological droughts for water resources applications the absolute deficit relative to the normal condition is fundamental to risk assessment and decision making van loon 2015 two types of threshold based approaches have been used in the literature fixed and variable van loon et al 2019 the fixed drought threshold fdt is more suitable for areas with less climate variability throughout the year whereas the variable drought thresholds vdts are more practical for locations with considerable seasonal climate variability the objective of this study thus is to construct the response relationship model of doc to hydrological drought characteristics and use it to simulate the doc concentration during the hydrological drought this paper focuses on the following three aspects i reveal the long term trends of doc and their possible driving mechanisms ii construct the response relationship model of doc to hydrological drought characteristics iii investigate the capability to simulate doc based on hydrological drought characteristics to achieve the above aims this study took three sub basins hp3a hp4 and hp6 with different areas 9 28 ha 19 60 ha and 122 80 ha in harp lake catchment south central ontario southeastern canada as a case study area the long term measured data including monthly doc concentration and monthly hydrometeorological data streamflow precipitation and temperature during 1978 2018 were used to demonstrate our research objective and methods the remainder of the paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the research basins methodology and details of the analysis approaches the key results and discussion are presented in sections 3 and 4 section 5 exhibits the main conclusions of this study 2 methods 2 1 harp lake catchment the harp lake catchment 542 ha located in south central ontario southeastern canada fig 1 was selected to demonstrate our study the harp lake catchment is one of eight long term experimental sites monitored by the dorset environmental science center desc ontario ministry of environment conservation and parks meteorology hydrology and water quality data have been collected since late 1970s three sub basins i e hp3a hp4 and hp6 with different areas from small to large 9 28 ha 19 6 ha and 122 8 ha respectively were selected for this study the mainly used data information for this study is showing in table 1 the monthly doc concentration and streamflow data from july 1978 to december 2018 were used here the long time average of monthly doc streamflow during study periods in hp3a hp4 and hp6 are 3 08 0 33 mg l 3 65 3 12 l s mean standard deviation 6 51 1 05 mg l 20 75 17 26 l s and 7 97 2 91 mg l 1 96 1 73 l s respectively table 1 the average monthly temperature in the study catchment within a year differs from 4 98 c to 25 38 c 1978 2018 the average temperature in january february and december is below zero and above zero in other months monthly mean precipitation varies from 60 81 mm to 104 83 mm 1978 2018 with a long time average of 86 19 mm there was about one third of annual precipitation falling as snow fu and yao 2015 and snowpack appears from december to april as temperature rising in march spring snow melt occurred from march to may and contributes about 50 of annual runoff in the harp lake catchment hrycik et al 2021 here the monthly precipitation temperature and sulfate i e so4 were used for revealing the change trends of doc all the data used have undergone strict quality control and have been applied for other related topics research james et al 2022 fu et al 2014 imtiazy et al 2020 yao et al 2014 2016 zhang et al 2016 2 2 integrated framework the integrated framework contains three parts as follows part 1 long term trends of interest variables non parametric trend test i e mann kendall mk and linear trend test approaches were both served to examine the trends for annual and monthly variables mk test method is used because it is less disturbed by outliers mann 1945 kendall 1976 the slope of linear model can generally quantitatively characterize the rise or decline of interest variables part 2 response sensitivity of doc to streamflow at different timescales before extracting hydrological drought characteristics we need to determine the response sensitivity of doc to streamflow due to the cumulative effect of doc in the river birkel et al 2017 dawson et al 2011 mehring et al 2013 pearson correlation coefficient pcc is widely used to confirm the sensitivity for the response of hydrological process to meteorological process in previous studies apurv et al 2017 barker et al 2016 huang et al 2017 hellwig et al 2020 here it was served to examine the response sensitivity of doc to streamflow at different timescales the moving average window was used to determine different timescales of streamflow for example 2 month of moving average window represents two months timescale of streamflow i e 2 month and so on different timescales of streamflow reflect different hydrologic information to clearly describe the response sensitivity of doc to streamflow and identify the characteristics of hydrological drought events the pcc analysis method was used to identify the timescale of moving averaged streamflow having a maximum correlation tmax with monthly doc hellwig et al 2020 we then extracted characteristics of hydrological drought events at the identified streamflow timescale part 3 response relationship model of doc to hydrological drought characteristics based on the results obtained from part 2 the hydrological drought characteristics including duration and severity were identified according to vdts method van loon 2015 and the so called run theory yevjevich 1967 the definitions of hydrological drought characteristics and run theory are described in the following section then we used the autoregressive integrated moving average arima model box and jenkins 1976 to construct the response relationship model of doc to hydrological drought duration and severity based on cross validation method shao et al 1997 in the execution of cross validation method 2 3 samples of identified hydrological drought events were regarded as training set and remaining 1 3 samples were deemed to test set three evaluation indicators coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse and mean absolute percentage error mape are used to determine the goodness of fit performance of response model among three sub basins in the harp lake catchment statistical samples for hp3a basin were used to construct and validate the response relationship model and the obtained optimal arima model with the same parameters no added or reduced ones but different regression coefficients were applied to hp4 and hp6 basins to verify the applicability of models fig 2 shows the schematic flowchart for the integrated framework the details of the methods used here are described below 2 3 identifying hydrological drought characteristics based on vdts and run theory the framework presented in fig 2 can be served with both vdts and fdts depending on the climate features of research regions here vdts method was used to identify hydrological drought events because the climate of harp lake catchment has obvious seasonal difference zhang et al 2016 and the vdts method can be used to reflect the drought characteristics in a region with obvious seasonal climate features van loon et al 2019 the procedures for determining the vdts are as follows i the monthly streamflow records are ranked separately for each month i e from january to december ii the corresponding threshold level e g from q70 to q90 for each month is examined according to a particular percentile of the streamflow duration curve cumulative frequency of streamflow is from high to low as recommended by van loon 2015 q80 threshold for each month is recommended because it is widely used to identify hydrological drought events van loon 2015 van loon et al 2019 when the hydrological drought events were identified the hydrological drought characteristics including duration d and severity s were then extracted based on run theory yevjevich 1967 according to the rules of the run theory if the streamflow series in a certain month is below the threshold the month is regarded as a drought month if the streamflow series in a certain period of time remains below the threshold this period is regarded as a hydrological drought event the d is defined as the period from the beginning to the end of the drought month the cumulative value of the difference between the streamflow and the drought threshold during d is defined as drought severity s the average s during d is regarded as the drought intensity i wu et al 2018 the hydrological drought events with a minimum duration of 1 month were extracted for more drought samples 2 4 statistical analysis 2 4 1 temporal trends test mk trend test method mann 1945 kendall 1976 is recommended by the world meteorological organization as a nonparametric approach for detecting the trends of long term interest variables the significance level i e a of mk test for interest variable change trend is set as 0 05 and 0 01 in this study and the corresponding mk statistical values are 1 96 a 0 05 and 2 38 a 0 01 respectively mk statistical value being larger than 0 but less than 1 96 means an insignificant increasing trend for interest variables when mk statistical value is between 1 96 and 2 38 it means a significant increasing trend mk statistical value being larger than 2 38 represents a very significant increasing trend for interest variables when mk statistical value is less than 0 but large than 1 96 it means an insignificant decreasing trend for interest variables and so on besides the slope of linear model for interest variables was also determined here because it can quantify the specific value of an increase or decrease in a certain variable e g the amount of change per 10 years as mentioned above 2 4 2 response sensitivity of doc to different timescales of streamflow pearson correlation coefficient pcc method silva et al 2016 was used to obtain response sensitivity of monthly doc to different timescales of streamflow this approach was motivated by the fact that the cumulative of doc concentration response to the hydrologic processes significantly differ among timescales birkel et al 2017 dawson et al 2011 mehring et al 2013 in addition to clearly describe the response relationship of doc to hydrological drought characteristics it is necessary to confirm the response sensitivity of doc to streamflow the pcc method was used to determine the correlation between monthly doc and different timescales of streamflow for each month and the maximum correlation tmax for a specific timescale was selected and regarded as a very sensitive one for the response of doc to streamflow to calculate tmax by the pcc method we used moving average window method to obtain different timescales of streamflow e g n month where n stands for the different moving window in months e g ranging from 1 to 12 months the monthly doc time series within a year was cross correlated with each of the n month of streamflow under corresponding month time series the n with the largest pcc value was selected as tmax and appropriate timescale for the streamflow time series is further selected to identify hydrological drought events based on vdts hellwig et al 2020 2 4 3 construction validation and application of response relationship model 1 construction the response relationship of doc to hydrological drought characteristics was constructed by using arima model using data of hp3a basin the arima model has been widely used in the financial field to forecast the future development of economy or enterprises jiang et al 2021 lam et al 2009 it has also been used in drought forecasting han et al 2010 mishr and desai 2005 because of the flexibility and rigor in every step of the model construction for an appropriate model the basic idea of arima model is that if the behavior of a variable in a time series is random and non stationary a certain mathematical model is used to approximate this variable sequence box and jenkins 1976 the doc and hydrological drought characteristics have random and non stationary properties and there is a certain relationship between them in some extent there are three parameters in arima model i e p d and q which respectively represent the autoregressive item p the number of differences that was made when the variable time series becomes stationary d and the numbers of moving average q as the i can be obtained from the ratio of s and d we just set the d and s as the independent variable in the arima model and the doc during the hydrological drought is regarded as dependent variable the detail process for calculating arima model can be found in lam et al 2009 all arima modeling processes are performed in ibm spss statistics the best fit arima model was identified based on the evaluation indicators namely r 2 rmse and mape the equation for r 2 rmse and mape are described as follows 1 r 2 i 1 n o i o i 1 n s i s i 1 n o i o i 1 n s i s 2 2 2 r m s e i 1 n o i s i 2 n 3 m a p e i 1 n o i s i o i 100 n where o and s represent observed and simulated values i e doc respectively i and n represent the sample number and total numbers the closer r 2 is to 1 and the closer rmse and mape are to 0 the optimal validation model is considered the model with the highest r 2 the lowest rmse and mape were selected as the optimal response relationship model 2 validation a cross validation is a model validation approach for examining a predictive model using another independent data set that is not used in model construction process shao et al 1997 the sample statistics of doc and d and s for each hydrological drought event were first divided into multiple training and test set groups 2 3 of the samples were used to the training test in the model construction and the remaining 1 3 samples were regarded as the test set for cross validation then we used the r 2 rmse and mape to evaluate the goodness of fit performance of response relationship model in the test set there are multiple group values of simulated doc because the statistics samples i e hydrological drought characteristics are divided into different groups the model with the best results of the evaluation indicators was selected to represent the optimal model 3 application the optimal model obtained from the construction and validation steps with the same arima model parameters but different multiple regression coefficients were applied to another two sub basins i e hp4 and hp6 to demonstrate the applicability of our proposed methodology also the r 2 rmse and mape were determined to examine the goodness of fit performance of the optimal response model in the hp4 and hp6 the integrated framework presented in this study therefore includes construction validation and application of response relationship model of doc to hydrological drought characteristics 3 results 3 1 long term annual trends of interest variables the annual doc exhibits a significant p 0 01 increasing trend over the past 41 years for three sub basins in the harp lake catchment fig 3 however the annual streamflow shows insignificant increasing trend p 0 1 for the hp6 basin annual doc and streamflow have increased 0 73 mg l and 0 05 l s per decade over the past years for the hp4 basin annual doc and streamflow have increased 0 34 mg l and 0 26 l s and increased 0 11 mg l and 0 08 l s in hp3a basin respectively the mk test for the annual doc and streamflow trends is similar to the results of linear trend test at hp3a and hp6 sub basins fig 4 that is giving a very significant increase trend mk statistics 1 96 for doc but insignificant increase trend mk statistics 1 96 for streamflow however the change trends for annual streamflow in hp4 shows an insignificant decreasing trend from the mk statistics mk statistics 0 28 it is not consistent with the linear trend test for the hp4 basin as the changes of annual streamflow shows an insignificant increase trend when using the linear trend test checking the annual streamflow of hp4 in fig 3 there is an outlier 43 03 l s in 2014 and the outlier is more than double the average of annual streamflow 20 67 l s during 1978 2018 thus it is necessary to combine mk and linear trend tests to discuss the change trends of interest variables 3 2 response sensitivity of doc to streamflow processes the correlations between monthly doc and streamflow at different timescales within a year are different fig 5 a 1 c 1 for hp3a there is a strong positive correlation between doc and streamflow of shorter timescales for march to july fig 5 a 3 and the positive correlation extends to longer timescale e g 12 month resulting a positive correlation between doc and streamflow of all timescales 1 month to 12 month fig 5 a 1 for march to july the maximum average correlation between doc and different timescales of streamflow for hp3a basin is focused on 1 month timescale fig 5 a 2 meanwhile there is a positive correlation at shorter timescale for october to january fig 5 a 1 for hp4 basin there is a strong positive correlation between doc and streamflow for march to may fig 5 b 3 and the positive correlation extends to all timescales of streamflow 1 month to 12month fig 5 b 1 however the pcc values for other months and other timescales are negative or close to zero in hp4 basin the maximum average correlation for hp4 basin is focused on 1 month timescale fig 5 b 2 for hp6 basin a weak correlation is seen between doc and streamflow of different timescales fig 5 c 1 except for march to june with 1 to 3 month timescales fig 5 c 2 and c 3 also the maximum average correlation for hp6 basin is focused on 1 month timescale fig 5 c 2 it means that the response sensitivity of doc to streamflow is very different from month to month for three sub basins on the whole there is a relatively high positive correlation between doc and 1 month timescale of streamflow at each of three sub basins fig 5 a 2 b 2 and c 2 although the response sensitivity is very different in different months within a year over any sub basin the response process of monthly doc to streamflow processes is reflected in one month in general thus for constructing the response relationship model of doc to hydrological drought characteristics well and unifying the timescales and comparing results the monthly 1 month scale streamflow for identifying hydrological drought events was adopted 3 3 response relationship model of doc to hydrological drought characteristics 3 3 1 identification of hydrological drought events using the run theory method based on vdts i e q80 method the characteristics i e d and s of each hydrological drought event for hp3a hp4 and hp6 basins were generated shown in fig 6 the upper part of each figure in fig 6 shows the cumulative doc during the hydrological drought the lower part displays the d i e x axis length in each hydrological drought and absolute s for each hydrological drought event the d of hydrological drought with larger than 3 months was summarized in table 2 forty eight forty nine and fifty one hydrological drought events were extracted by the run theory and vdts methods at the hp3a hp4 and hp6 during 1978 2018 respectively as seen from table 2 for the hp3a the most severe three hydrological drought events with long d happened during 1989 07 1989 12 1991 05 1991 09 and 1998 04 1998 12 among which the longest d was from april 1998 to december 1998 with d of 9 months the corresponding absolute value of s was 6 01 l s for the hp4 the most severe three hydrological drought events with long d happened during 1987 04 1987 09 1989 07 1989 12 and 1998 04 1998 12 among which the longest d was from april 1998 to december 1998 with d of 9 months the corresponding absolute value of s was 21 31 l s for the hp6 the most severe three hydrological drought events with long d happened during 1997 08 1997 12 1998 04 1998 08 and 2002 09 2003 01 all of them are 5 months d but the largest s among them was from april 1998 to august 1998 note that the longest d in hp6 basin is just 5 months and less than the longest d i e 9 months in other two basins this is because the streamflow in september 1998 is higher than drought threshold and the hydrological drought events during 1998 was temporarily interrupted the streamflow in october and november 1998 was below the drought threshold the pattern of cumulative doc during the hydrological drought is consistent with most hydrological drought events fig 6 namely the larger the cumulative doc during the hydrological drought is the larger the values of d and absolute s are and vice versa the reason is that the doc has a cumulative effect during droughts which is related to drought inhibiting doc export clark et al 2005 worral and burt 2008 fig 7 shows the linear relationship between doc and d or s for three sub basins with a close linear relationship between doc and d s the smallest r 2 is 0 19 and the highest r 2 is 0 97 as the d s increases so does doc the fitting lines between doc and d s are generally located within the 95 prediction band of the corresponding linear functions it indicates that the doc during the hydrological drought can be simulated based on hydrological drought characteristics fig 7 also shows that the correlation between doc and d is higher than that between doc and s i e average of r 2 is 0 92 vs 0 35 which means that the effect of d on doc is larger than s 3 3 2 construction and validation of response relationship model for hp3a basin there are thirty one models were constructed based on arima model method and cross validation rule noted that the d s and doc concentration during the hydrological drought had non seasonal features and neither their auto correlation function acf nor partial auto correlation function pacf had drag tail properties figs s1 s6 after repeating tests the determined values of three parameters for arima are 2 0 and 2 for p d and q values respectively the values of evaluation indicators r 2 rmse and mape for test set samples are summarized in fig 8 fig 8 shows that each evaluation indicator achieves satisfactory results in all model groups e g r 2 0 78 rmse 1 44 and mape 25 the highest r 2 the lowest rmse and mape values for the goodness of fit performance between observed and simulated doc occur in group 2 and thus the response relationship model in the group 2 is chosen as the optimal response relationship model fig 9 shows the simulated and observed hydrographs of doc values for construction and validation samples in the hp3a basin the simulated doc was calculated based on optimal response relationship model i e y 2 56 1 0 07 2 0 13 y x 1 and x 2 represents doc d and s respectively the simulations fit observations very well the values of r 2 rmse and mape for the construction validation samples set are 0 99 0 87 0 75 0 86 and 10 43 13 69 3 3 3 application of response relationship model the same parameters for arima model but with different multiple regression coefficients were further applied to simulate doc in the hp4 and hp6 basins using the corresponding identified hydrological drought characteristics of two sub basins the goodness of fit performance for the simulated doc and observed doc values in hp4 and hp6 basins are exhibited in fig 10 the response relationship models for hp4 and hp6 basins are y 6 25 1 0 23 2 0 83 and y 8 21 1 0 72 2 1 75 y x 1 and x 2 represents doc d and s respectively there is a good performance for the simulated doc in hp4 and hp6 basins fig 10 all simulated and observed doc samples are distributed near the 1 1 line and most of samples are located in 95 prediction band the values of r 2 rmse and mape for the hp4 hp6 basin are 0 97 0 85 2 01 4 72 and 3 62 15 59 although the goodness of fit performance for simulated doc in hp6 basin is lower than that of hp4 the simulations fit observations well in general thus we think that the constructed response relationship model of doc to hydrological drought characteristics based on our proposed integrated framework can be used to simulate doc concentration during the hydrological drought and it may be applied to other basins of other regions with proper configuration 4 discussion the long term annual doc series i e 1978 2018 showed a significant a 0 05 increasing trend in harp lake catchment several hypotheses were used to explain the observed increases hruska et al 2009 worral and burt 2008 for example increasing temperature leading to higher production of humic and fulvic acids in soils and peat lands was initially proposed as the cause of observed doc increases freeman et al 2001 other hypotheses based on climatic changes were connected with rising co2 in the atmosphere and increasing net primary production freeman et al 2004 fenner et al 2021 imtiazy et al 2020 or increasing amounts of precipitating and runoff blaurock et al 2021 evans et al 2005 hongve et al 2004 warner and saros 2019 furthermore more aerobic conditions in drier and warmer peats were also proposed as the driver of doc increases in peaty soils evans et al 2006 hruska et al 2009 monteith et al 2007 however the forcing mechanism for doc variation is very complex in different areas with different timescales clark et al 2005 freeman et al 2004 here we further checked the cross correlation among doc streamflow precipitation temperature and so4 during the hydrological drought based on pcc method as shown in fig 11 the correlations between doc and streamflow precipitation so4 were negative but positive with temperature in which the correlations with streamflow and so4 were significant a 0 05 additionally the correlation between temperature and so4 was significantly negative a 0 01 in hp3a and hp4 a 0 05 in hp6 thus we infer that the variation of doc during the hydrological drought was influenced by variation of streamflow and so4 directly and also influenced by temperature variation indirectly despite the correlation between doc and temperature is positive in all three sub basins just the correlation in hp6 passed significance test a 0 01 however the correlation between temperature and so4 in all three sub basins are significant a 0 05 thus the changes in streamflow can revise doc changes during the hydrological drought directly the changes in temperature can lead to so4 change directly and may lead to doc changes indirectly the temperature has been proposed as a driver of changes in doc in many rivers or lakes due to its effects on enzymatic activity we would assert that temperature change could also be driving the trend in doc indirectly that we have observed in our study area similar to the conclusions reached by other researchers clark et al 2006 dawson et al 2011 fenner et al 2021 here we just analyzed the possible forcing mechanism of doc variation during the hydrological drought as the variation of doc in different areas and different timescales are very complex clark et al 2005 freeman et al 2004 further research is needed in our next work there is a different response sensitivity of doc to streamflow processes for different months within a year at each of three sub basins and also different among sub basins this is related to the local seasonality of climate streamflow and doc export in the study area for example the monthly streamflow is relatively high and floods are easy to occur in spring due to snowmelt hrycik et al 2021 fu and yao 2015 zhang et al 2016 however the streamflow is relatively low in summer and fall as a result doc is rapidly exported in the spring during the snowmelt floods and accumulated again in the summer as the flow is low thus doc in spring from march to may is more sensitive to streamflow process than in other seasons fig 5 the correlation coefficients between temperature and streamflow precipitation is negative fig 11 indicating that higher temperature may lead to less flow and precipitation in harp lake catchment this may help to explain the seasonal difference of response sensitivity of doc to streamflow within a year moreover the 1 month timescale of streamflow was selected as the optimal timescale to confirm the drought threshold for each month and extract hydrological drought events based on the results in fig 5 a 2 b 2 and c 2 in general although the response sensitivity of doc to different timescales of streamflow varied in each month most of maximum correlations between doc and different timescales of streamflow focused on 1 month especially at hp3a and hp4 sub basin thus for unification of the timescale and comparison of the results the 1 month timescale was finally selected because if different timescales are selected for each month it will not only cause difficulty in matching drought threshold on timescale but also cause failure to reflect the drought duration feature e g drought continuity for example if the 2 month timescale is used for identifying hydrological drought in march but 5 month timescale is used for april it will cause the characteristics of extracted hydrological drought events being not comparable especially for drought severity this is because the cumulative average moving window method was used to determine the different timescales of streamflow the 2 month and 5 month timescale represent two and five consecutive months of cumulative streamflow shortage respectively although using the correlation method to determine the response of a certain variable to hydrometeorological process still exits many challenges shi et al 2022 it is a robust approach choice huang et al 2017 hellwig et al 2020 wu et al 2021b the response of doc to streamflow in hp3a basin is more sensitive i e the average of pcc value in hp3a is larger than that of hp4 and hp6 to streamflow than in hp4 and hp6 basins we suspect that the first reason may be that hp4 and hp6 basins have more proportion of wetland or beaver pond area such wetlands or beaver ponds in hp4 and hp6 basins account for 11 and 4 5 of their total basin area but just account for 0 7 in hp3a basin lane et al 2020 richardson 2011 the second possible reason is that there are two households near the upstream of hp6 monitoring site whose domestic sewage may interfere with the natural response process of doc to streamflow processes because the hp6 has smaller basin area but higher doc concentration compared to other two basins fig 3 using the arima model and integrated framework in our study the response relationship model of doc to hydrological drought characteristics were constructed and the response relationship of doc to hydrological drought characteristics can be described clearly figs 9 and 10 with the increase of drought d and s doc concentration increased the relationship between doc and hydrological drought d is greater than that of s fig 7 which means that the doc concentration during hydrological drought depends more on the drought d rather than the drought s although previous studies have reported the possible relationship between doc and droughts or low flow e g blaurock et al 2021 clark et al 2005 2006 mehring et al 2013 worral and burt 2008 ritson et al 2017 they did not specifically explore the detailed response relationship of doc to hydrological drought characteristics i e d and s we presented an integrated framework fig 2 for constructing verifying and applying the response relationship model and achieved good application results figs 9 and 10 there are four advantages of the proposed integrated framework i the correlation analysis method i e pcc is used to detect the response sensitivity of doc to streamflow processes under different timescales the correlation analysis can be used to identify the timescales of streamflow most aligned with the monthly doc concentration this approach facilitates the identification of characteristics of hydrological drought events matching the doc concentration well on the one hand fig 6 on the other hand it can be used to detect the response sensitivity of doc to streamflow processes fig 5 ii the vdts combined with run theory are used to identify hydrological drought events and their characteristics which can identify the actual hydrological drought events well iii the arima model combined with the cross validation methods are served to construct and confirm the optimal response relationship model of doc to hydrological drought characteristics minimizing the uncertainty of response relationship model since the d s and doc concentration during the hydrological drought have non seasonal features and neither their acf nor pacf has drag tail characteristics figs s1 s6 thus the d value for the arima was set to 0 although the constructed response relationship models are multivariate linear regression finally the doc concentration during the hydrological drought can be simulated well based on the arima principle fig 9 iv although the presented integrated framework is just used to detect the response relationship of doc to hydrological drought characteristics here it can be also used to examine the response relationship of doc or other water quality elements to other drought types i e meteorological agricultural and ecological droughts the presented trials provided a perspective for improving our understanding of the relationship between doc and hydrological drought and simulating doc during hydrological drought the approach however has certain limitations for example how to reveal the impact of natural and human activities on doc changes and distinguish the different impacts of them on doc change needs further in depth research for the harp lake catchment the driving mechanism of changes in doc and the relationship with the migration and transformation of other chemical elements on land also need to be further discussed despite the response relationship model of doc to hydrological drought characteristics constructed by our proposed integrated framework applied well in the study catchment the model parameters for other basins of other regions need to calibrate the influence of droughts on the variation of doc in different climate areas and different timescales are very complex which also still need further study for example how droughts with different intensities e g different return periods effects on doc variation remains unclear in future research we will consider these limitations and improve the proposed framework for the determinations of driving mechanism of doc change and predict it better 5 conclusions this study presented an integrated framework for constructing validating and applying the response relationship model of doc to hydrological drought characteristics also the response sensitivity of doc to streamflow processes and possible driving mechanism for the variation of doc during the hydrological drought were revealed the framework was carried out for three headwater steams with long term measured data in harp lake catchment south central ontario southeastern canada we have shown the following i there is a clear relationship by which doc concentration responds to hydrological drought characteristics with the increase of drought duration and severity doc concentration also increased this response relationship was better understood by establishing the multiple regression model between doc and hydrological drought duration and severity from which the doc concentration during the hydrological drought can be simulated or predicted based on drought duration and severity variables ii the impact of drought duration on doc is larger than that of drought severity namely the cumulative doc during the hydrological drought depends more on the length of drought duration rather than drought severity iii for harp lake catchment the response process of doc concentration to different timescales of streamflow process varied during a year in which the response sensitivity is more obvious from march to may than other months due to the specific climate and hydrology features the variation of doc concentration during the hydrological drought is significant a 0 05 related to the variation of streamflow negative and so4 negative directly but significantly with the variation of temperature indirectly in other words the variation of temperature affected doc variation indirectly through influence on so4 variation during the hydrological drought despite the doc formation and conversion mechanisms during the hydrological drought are complex and there are still many challenges in doc prediction based on extreme hydrological events the results of this study indicate a certain possibility for simulating doc under the premise of hydrological drought predictability iv the multiple regression models with two parameters can be used to describe the response relationship between doc concentration and hydrological drought characteristics its rationality and applicability need to be further discussed because physical characteristics and human activities interact differently with doc and droughts in different catchments the results and improved doc predictability should be helpful to improve the implementation of a water quality safety early warning and are expected to provide additional information for policymaker to select appropriate water and ecological security strategies during the droughts with the global warming and the acceleration of hydrological cycle increase of extreme hydrological events our results suggest that more attention should be paid to water quality and ecological security issues caused by water pollution and extreme

16161,struvite mgnh4po4 6h2o crystallization is a promising method of phosphorus recovery from wastewater as for digestive livestock wastewater the extensive residues of antibiotics could induce struvite recovery to spread antibiotic resistance and thereafter pose ecological risks to the environment in this study struvite crystals with different morphologies were produced from synthetic swine wastewater and tetracyclines tcs adsorbing capacities were investigated the important factors including the existence of mg2 ions and initial tcs concentration were examined the predominant adsorption between tcs and struvite crystals was electrostatic interaction with the maximum capacity at doxycycline dxc 876 5 μg kg oxytetracycline otc 1946 7 μg kg and tetracycline tc 2376 2 μg kg respectively well faceted struvite crystallites possessed high adsorption capacities than those of dendritic crystallite due to higher mg intensities on the crystallite surface the increment of phosphorus concentration could trigger the transformation of struvite morphology from needle to dendritic shapes with x shape as an intermediate stage which would reduce mg density in specific crystallite facets and therefore limit tcs adsorption onto struvite crystals the existence of mg2 ion would inhibit tcs deprotonation and thereafter improve tcs adsorption onto struvite crystals further investigation revealed that continuously elevating initial tcs concentration would promote the formation of 1 2 transferring to 1 1 tcs mg chelates which would result in a fluctuation following a drastic augment of tcs adsorption capacity graphical abstract graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords phosphorus recovery antibiotics struvite morphology tetracycline 1 introduction in the past decades rapid economic growth and urbanization in developing countries have engendered a massive demand for pig farming fu et al 2022 zhang et al 2022 according to the statistics released by the national bureau of statistics of china the annual production of pigs in china has reached approximately 527 million nbsprc 2021 consequently numerous intensive livestock farms are springing up with dramatic increases of nitrogen and phosphorus being discharged from livestock wastewater into the environment which has triggered public concern about the pollution around the world fu et al 2022 huang et al 2021 recently phosphorus recovery typically struvite mgnh4po4 6h2o crystallization from livestock wastewater has gained wide attention since it displays the big potential for nutrients recovery of phosphorus and nitrogen from wastewater and retards the scarcity of phosphorus rock resources worldwide liu et al 2021a nandre et al 2021 wang et al 2021b the recovered struvite can be utilized as a slow release fertilizer in agriculture directly due to its high nutrient contents liu et al 2021c shaddel et al 2020 veterinary antibiotics are extensively used in animal farming for therapy and growth promotor wang et al 2019 due to the poor assimilation of antibiotics in the animal guts about 30 90 of antibiotics are excreted as parent compounds or metabolites in feces and urine ma et al 2018 in addition antibiotics are hard to be degraded completely in wastewater treatment processes chen et al 2021 xu et al 2021 zainab et al 2020 with the reported removal rate ranging from 11 to 86 gros et al 2019 these suggested that the remained antibiotics in treated wastewater can threaten the ecological system by generating antibiotic resistance and spreading the antibiotic resistance genes chen et al 2020a elder et al 2021 long term exposure of antibiotics ultimately will pose potential risks to the environment as a family of broad spectrum antibiotics tetracyclines tcs are one of the extensive veterinary antibiotics utilized in the livestock industry for their beneficial cost effect and effective antimicrobial activities wang et al 2021a tcs have been detected with significant residue in livestock wastewater and the maximum concentrations can reach 685 6 μg l chen et al 2020b hu et al 2021 tcs are amphoteric molecules with multiple ionized groups including ketone amino hydroxyl and other functional groups tcs adsorbed by numerous adsorbents have been investigated and their main adsorption mechanisms include surface complexation bridging hydrophobic partitioning cation exchange and electrodonor acceptor interactions cheng et al 2016 liu et al 2021b yang et al 2021b with regard to struvite recovery from livestock wastewater the recovered products could adsorb antibiotics lou et al 2018 wang et al 2020 which therefore suggested that the recovered struvite present a threat to agricultural production and public health it should be pointed out that struvite generated under different conditions displayed different morphologies which are the key features of struvite properties and can therefore determine the efficiencies of struvite recovery by accelerating the settling velocity and improving the separation efficiency etc shaddel et al 2019 such variation of property might affect the antibiotic adsorption capacities however few studies have reported on this issue in this study struvite crystallization was performed under different conditions by using synthetic wastewater so as to obtain different morphologies and their adsorption capabilities on tcs were investigated besides the impacts of mg existence on the adsorption capacity of struvite crystals with various morphologies were estimated the outcomes will provide valuable information for controlling the key parameters of struvite formation to reduce antibiotic adsorption during phosphorous recovery process as well as for further studies of antibiotic transport behavior during struvite recovery from real swine wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and standards in this study three typical tcs standards including tetracycline tc oxytetracycline otc and doxycycline dxc were purchased from the alladin inc usa tetracycline d6 tc d6 as an internal standard for analysis was obtained from the tononto research chemicals inc canada the stock solutions of synthetic wastewater for struvite precipitation including 0 40 mol l nh4 2hpo4 and 0 48 mol l mgcl2 were prepared by dissolving nh4 2hpo4 and mgcl2 6h2o into ultrapure water respectively ultrapure water was generated by a milli q water purification system 18 2 ωm cm from millipore boston usa for the purpose of regulating ph value during struvite precipitation process 5 0 mol l naoh and 0 2 mol l hcl were utilized 2 2 experimental design and setup according to the literature ph value and phosphate concentration were the two key factors that determined struvite morphology muhmood et al 2021 prywer and torzewska 2009 ye et al 2011 in this study a series of experiments were conducted by using synthetic wastewater so as to investigate the variation of struvite morphologies and their impacts on tcs adsorption the operational conditions of struvite crystallization were conducted on the basis of our previous studies ye et al 2014 ye et al 2011 where struvite precipitation was performed homogeneously without seeds and the reaction time was set at 60 min with the agitation rate at 200 rpm in order to achieve high phosphorus recovery efficiency mg p molar ratios for struvite crystallization in the experiments were set at 1 2 1 the levels of ph value at 8 0 10 5 and phosphate concentration were determined by referencing the swine wastewater and sludge digestion supernatant as described in previous studies cheng et al 2019 muhmood et al 2021 ye et al 2011 the recovered products were pure struvite which were determined by the method on the basis of our previous studies ye et al 2014 ye et al 2011 the concentrations of tcs in this study were referred to the detected levels in the literature wang et al 2021a 2 2 1 influence of struvite morphology determined by ph variation it has been reported that ph variation can change the morphology of struvite crystals significantly prywer and torzewska 2009 in this section a series of experiments were conducted by setting initial phosphate concentration at 5 0 mmol l and ph values for struvite crystallization were adjusted to 8 0 8 5 9 0 9 5 10 0 and 10 5 respectively after struvite reaction crystalline precipitates were individually collected into several beakers and rinsed with pure water of corresponding ph values for three times so as to eliminate the interference of residual mg2 nh4 n and po4 3 p after that desired tcs contents were added into the beaker with pure water to reach 300 μg l and then subsequent adsorption experiment was carried out by setting ph value at 9 0 after agitation for 60 min the aqueous and solid samples were withdrawn for antibiotic analyses 2 2 2 influence of struvite morphology determined by different phosphate concentrations according to previous researches the changes of po4 3 ion concentrations can produce several morphologies of struvite crystals significantly different from those generated under various ph levels prywer and torzewska 2009 wang et al 2021b ye et al 2014 in this study struvite crystallization was achieved by keeping ph value at 9 0 and initial phosphate concentrations were adjusted at 3 5 4 5 5 5 6 5 7 5 8 5 and 9 5 mmol l respectively after the reaction crystalline products with different morphologies were collected into different beakers and rinsed with pure water for three times to exclude mg2 nh4 n and po4 3 p for the experiments of antibiotic adsorption the initial tcs concentration was designed as 250 μg l in order to keep the mass ratio of adsorbate tcs to adsorbent struvite crystals in every run at a constant value the working volumes of beakers were set at 1 000 1 286 1 517 1 857 2 429 and 2 714 l respectively by adding pure water antibiotic adsorption was performed by dosing desired amount of tcs into the beakers and ph value was kept at 9 0 constantly after agitation for 60 min the aqueous and solid samples were withdrawn for antibiotic analyses 2 2 3 effects of mg ion on tcs adsorption as described in previous studies aristilde et al 2016 carlotti et al 2012 mg2 can complex with tcs and therefore influence the transport behavior of tcs in the environment in the present study the existence of mg2 ion and its effects on tcs adsorption onto different morphological struvite crystals were investigated before struvite crystallization the initial phosphate concentration was set at 5 0 mmol l and tcs at 300 μg l subsequent struvite reaction was carried out by setting mg p molar ratio at 1 2 1 and ph value at 8 0 8 5 9 0 9 5 10 0 and 10 5 respectively the aqueous samples and precipitates were withdrawn for further analysis 2 2 4 effects of initial tcs concentration for struvite crystallization the dosage amount of magnesium source is normally excessive so as to guarantee the efficiency of phosphorus recovery however as a divalent cation mg2 can theoretically combine with tcs to form 1 1 and 1 2 tcs mg complexes aristilde et al 2016 carlotti et al 2012 which might fluctuate the quantity of struvite adsorbing antibiotics in case the concentrations of tcs in the wastewater change in this section the investigation of initial tcs concentration ranging from 100 μg l to 1000 μg l was conducted and struvite crystallization was performed at ph 9 0 with initial phosphorus concentration set at 4 0 mmol l and p n mg molar ratio at 1 2 1 2 respectively after the experiment the samples were withdrawn and subjected to solid and liquid separation the supernatants were further analyzed by uv vis spectrum to evaluate the interactions between tcs and mg2 ion and the solids were measured to determine tcs adsorption capacity 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 common methods ammonium nh4 n and phosphorus po4 3 p were respectively determined by nessler s reagent and phosphorus molybdenum blue spectrophotometry in accordance with the standard methods apha 1998 magnesium ion was assayed by the inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer optima 7000dv perkinelmer usa ph was measured by phs 3c probe 2 3 2 characterization methods the crystalline phases produced in struvite precipitation were analyzed with x ray diffractometer x pert prompd

ultrasonic extraction for 10 min to dissolve the solids were carried out solid phase extraction method xu et al 2013 was employed as the pretreatment method to concentrate tcs from the samples by using the oasis hlb cartridge 200 mg 6 ml waters milford usa afterwards the concentrates were subjected to liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms abi3200 qtrap usa combining with a phenomenex kinetex symmetry c18 column 2 1 mm 50 mm for antibiotics identification and quantitation the mass spectrometry system installed with electrospray ionization esi source was run in the positive mode with desolvation temperature at 300 c and capillary voltage 5 5 kv recovery rate and linearity were employed to evaluate the determination of tcs with lc ms ms detection limits and the quantification for the instrument were decided by using calibration curves as reported in the previous literature lou et al 2018 cai et al 2020 3 results and discussion 3 1 influence of morphological struvite with ph dependence to investigate the impacts of struvite crystal habits on tcs adsorption capacity different morphological struvite crystals were obtained by setting ph levels ranging from 8 0 to10 5 for struvite crystallization fig 1 showed sem images of struvite crystals with the increase of ph values struvite morphologies switched from the well faceted polyhedral structure to the dendrite structure finer tipped and smaller dendrite structures were observed at high ph values fig 2 demonstrated tcs adsorption capacities and bet surface areas corresponding to various morphological struvite crystals fig 1 the means of three antibiotic adsorption capacities were compared with the values of dxc 232 7 μg kg otc 224 7 μg kg and tc 282 4 μg kg respectively a stepwise increase of bet surface areas of struvite was observed while tcs adsorption capacities of struvite displayed a distinct profile fig 2 a to d with the maximum values dxc 359 3 μg kg otc 387 5 μg kg tc 379 4 μg kg on the crystals obtained at ph 8 0 fig 2a this unmatching relationship indicated that the tcs adsorption capacity might be determined by the intrinsic property of struvite crystals unreported it has been reported that the lattice structure of struvite particle comprises nh4 and po4 3 tetrahedral mg h2o 6 2 octahedral and the rectangular ac or bc crystallite facets are rich in mg h2o 6 2 with positive charge prywer and torzewska 2009 ye et al 2014 as for tcs they are hydrophilic compounds with three dissociated groups including tricarbonyl group tcs1 pka1 phenolic diketone moiety tcs2 pka2 and dimethylamino group tcs3 pka3 pollard and morra 2018 yue et al 2019 as described in the literature the adsorption mechanisms of tcs include hydrogen bonding electron donor acceptor π π dispersion interaction and electrostatic interaction which were ph dependant martins et al 2015 stylianou et al 2021 vakh et al 2021 yang et al 2011 in case ph level was enhanced to 9 0 i e alkaline conditions for struvite crystallization electrostatic interaction would be predominant this was because under such circumstance all the function groups were deprotonation and the tcs molecules were negatively charged han et al 2020 li et al 2021b as to struvite crystal it possessed hemimorphic morphology with unsymmetrical planes figure s1 prywer and torzewska 2009 which indicated that different crystallite faces possessed different magnesium densities it has been reported that mg contents are rich in struvite crystallite faces of 010 101 011 and 012 with different mg2 densities of 4 258 μmol m2 4 100 μmol m2 1 944 μmol m2 and 2 872 μmol m2 respectively li et al 2015 li et al 2021a figure s2 illustrated struvite molecules on 010 face of struvite crystallite where the green octahedral represented mg h2o 6 2 group in the present study the peak intensity of xrd diffraction in these crystallite faces was recorded fig 3 according to our previous researches ye et al 2011 shen et al 2015 the crystalline mineral formed was struvite it should be pointed out that the crystallinity of struvite was not significantly influenced by ph and mg existence as shown in fig 3 mg contents in different morphological struvite crystallites were calculated as present in table 1 it should be noted that mg contents of well faceted crystals were matching with the variation of tcs adsorption capacities such outcome was significant since it not only confirmed that mg h2o 6 2 octahedral in struvite crystal was prone to adsorb antibiotics through electrostatic interaction as described in the above text but also revealed that the crystallite morphology mg contents of struvite played a significant role on tcs adsorption capacity it should be pointed out that high mg contents in struvite crystallites produced at ph 10 0 table 1 e column and ph 10 5 table 1 f column didn t result in dramatic increment of tcs adsorption capacities as shown in fig 2 as described in the literature higher ph values would increase the supersaturation degree of struvite crystallization and improve negative zeta potential in the solution which would lead to the struvite crystal growth of dendrite structure with small size fig 1 e and f due to the enhancement of electrostatic repulsion among crystallites prywer and torzewska 2009 shaddel et al 2020 ye et al 2014 considering tcs negatively charged under alkaline condition li et al 2021b the increment of negative repulsion onto struvite crystals might offset a certain amount of tcs adsorption despite the increase of bet surface areas of crystals in the last two runs fig 2 3 2 influence of morphological struvite determined by phosphate concentration in this part struvite crystals with different morphological shapes were obtained by setting initial phosphate concentrations for struvite crystallization from 3 5 to 9 5 mmol l and their tc adsorption capacities were investigated fig 4 demonstrated the sem images of the struvite crystals in the case of phosphate concentrations higher than 7 5 mmol l the major morphology of struvite crystal kept needle shapes while a certain amount of x shapes were observed fig 4 e f and g as to tcs adsorption capacity it demonstrated a similar profile with bet surface areas corresponding to different morphological shapes of struvite crystals fig 5 where the profiles firstly displayed a gradual increase to initial phosphorus concentration at 5 5 mmol l following with a stable stage in this stage tcs possessed the maximum adsorption capacities at dxc 509 0 μg kg otc 841 7 μg kg and tc 951 6 μg kg respectively a further simultaneous decline of tcs adsorption capacities and bet surface areas were observed according to previous studies higher phosphorus concentrations in struvite crystallization created higher degrees of supersaturation condition and thereafter more formation of crystal nuclei and spontaneous aggregation could be generated prywer and torzewska 2009 shaddel et al 2019 ye et al 2014 moreover excess supersaturation by increasing phosphorus concentration could trigger the transformation of struvite morphology from needle to dendritic shapes with x shape as an intermediate stage shaddel et al 2019 as displayed in figure 4 the occurrence of x shape morphology indicated the formation of twin crystals assembling along the direction of 001 crystallite face li et al 2015 liu and qu 2017 manzoor et al 2018 which would squeeze and destruct the formation of 012 or 011 crystallite planes shaddel et al 2019 this was confirmed by the xrd spectra figure s3 where the intensity of 011 and 012 faces rich in mg density were significantly reduced such results suggested that the appearance of x shape morphology would limit the exposure of mg containing crystallite surface and therefore a matching trend of decrease of tcs adsorption capacities and bet surface areas was observed in fig 5 3 3 effects of mg ions existence to investigate mg2 influences on different morphological struvite crystal adsorbing tcs struvite crystallization was conducted at different ph values ranging from 8 0 to 10 5 with excessive magnesium existence the adsorption capacities were depicted in fig 6 although similar struvite morphologies were observed as those presented in fig 1 obvious distinctions on tcs adsorption capacities were detected compared to those determined in pure water fig 2 the profile of tcs adsorption capacity displayed a stable stage when ph was below 9 0 once ph value was enhanced up to 9 5 a steady increase of tcs adsorption capacity could be obtained fig 6 with the maximum values of dxc 532 1 μg kg otc 595 1 μg kg and tc 1136 0 μg kg these levels were significantly higher than those of dxc 359 3 μg kg otc 387 5 μg kg and tc 379 4 μg kg displayed in fig 2 respectively such discrimination suggested that the existence of magnesium ion in the liquor made an important contribution to tcs adsorption capacity as described in the above section struvite crystallite faces with different surficial magnesium densities possessed different tcs adsorption capacities which was based on the function of electrostatic repulsion in alkaline conditions however the comparison of tcs adsorption data in fig 6 to those in fig 2 revealed that the presence of excessive mg2 ion could improve tcs adsorption especially when ph was above 9 5 thereafter the interaction between mg2 and tcs was examined by evaluating the changes of uv vis spectrum as shown in fig 7 the co existence of mg ion with tcs resulted in peak shift and amplified the absorbance intensities the absorbance intensities of characteristic peaks of tc were enhanced from 0 865 to 0 985 and 0 890 to 1 208 otc from 0 919 to 0 992 and 1 007 to 1 193 and dxc from 0 955 to 1 339 respectively such peak amplification confirmed that mg2 could chelate with tcs to form antibiotic metal complexes chang et al 2013 yang et al 2021a zhou et al 2020 according to the literature tcs are a type of hydrophilic compounds with three dissociated groups i e tricarbonyl group tcs1 pka1 phenolic diketone moiety tcs2 pka2 and dimethylamino group tcs3 pka3 pollard and morra 2018 yue et al 2019 the protonation or deprotonation of tcs molecules is ph dependent take otc as an example the dissociation constants pka of otc1 otc2 and otc3 are 3 57 7 49 and 9 44 respectively han et al 2020 which suggests that otc molecular conformation will be negatively 7 49 ph 9 44 or much more negatively ph 9 44 charged in alkaline conditions accordingly the interaction of electrostatic repulsion between tcs and struvite crystals was predominant it should be noted that mg2 ion was prone to react with tcs at the functional groups of phenolic diketone moiety and dimethylamino group subsequently to form antibiotic metal complexes aristilde et al 2016 chang et al 2013 which was also supported by the profile variation in fig 7 this indicated that excessive mg2 would inhibit tcs deprotonation and thereafter improve the negative potential of tcs consequently struvite crystals were liable to adsorb tcs molecules and the steady increase of tcs adsorption capacity matching with ph enhancement was observed fig 6 3 4 effects of initial tcs concentration the investigation of initial tcs concentration on struvite adsorbing antibiotics at the existence of excessive mg2 was performed as demonstrated in fig 8 a gradual enhancement of tcs adsorption capacities was obtained while a following decline was observed once the initial tcs concentration reached 550 μg l drastic increase was detected when the initial tcs concentration was at 1000 μg l with the maximum adsorption capacities of dxc 876 5 μg kg otc 1946 7 μg kg and tc 2376 2 μg kg respectively as described in the about text the hydrophilic tcs possess three functional groups which can dissociate under different ph values for the neutral and alkalescent situations tcs possess three species i e free tcs mono tcsh and dianions tcs2 li et al 2021b vakh et al 2021 as the external source for struvite precipitation mg2 ion is prone to complex with tcs on phenolic diketone moiety tcs2 pka2 and dimethylamino group tcs3 pka3 subsequently to form 1 1 and 1 2 tcs mg chelates aristilde et al 2016 carlotti et al 2012 zhou et al 2020 such complexation suggests that mg2 ion has competitive effects with struvite crystals to chelate tcs molecules and might improve or inhibit tcs adsorption onto struvite crystals in this study the elevation of initial tcs concentration from 100 μg l to 550 μg l resulted in the increase of tcs adsorption capacity fig 8 which indicated that mg2 ion was excessive and could combine with tcs to form 1 2 tcs mg chelates carlotti et al 2012 zhou et al 2020 this could be supported by the variation of uv vis spectrum figure s4 where the profiles of low initial tcs concentrations displayed high absorbance intensities therefore tcs deprotonation was inhibited resulting in the increase of tcs negative potential consequently struvite crystals were liable to adsorb tcs molecules it should be noted that the further enhancement of tcs concentration from 550 μg l to 850 μg l resulted in a decline of tcs adsorption capacity this was because the chelation between mg2 and dimethylamino group in tcs molecules was unsaturated and the predominant species was 1 1 tcs mg complex monoanion tcsh with less hydrophobicity wessels et al 1998 the more initial tcs content had the less percentage of tcs chelated with mg2 and more free hydrophobic tcs molecules existed in the liquid carlotti et al 2012 wessels et al 1998 zhou et al 2020 therefore a drastic augment of tcs adsorption was observed at the initial tcs concentration at 1000 μg l 4 conclusion this study was conducted to investigate the adsorption behavior of tcs onto different morphological struvite crystals which were formed in synthetic livestock wastewater the effects of mg ions existence and initial tcs concentration were also investigated the predominant adsorption between tcs and struvite crystals was electrostatic interaction with the maximum capacity at dxc 876 5 μg kg otc 1946 7 μg kg and tc 2376 2 μg kg respectively well faceted struvite crystallites possessed higher adsorption capacities than those of dendritic crystallite due to higher mg intensities on the crystallite surface the enhancement of phosphorus concentration could trigger the transformation of struvite morphology from needle to dendritic shapes with x shape as an intermediate stage which would reduce mg density in specific crystallite facets and therefore limit tcs adsorption onto struvite crystals the existence of mg2 ion would inhibit tcs deprotonation and thereafter improve tcs adsorption onto struvite crystals further investigation revealed that continuously elevating initial tcs concentration would promote the formation of 1 2 tcs mg chelates transferring to 1 1 tcs mg chelates which would result in a fluctuation following a drastic augment of tcs adsorption capacity further experiments will be extended to struvite recovery in the real swine wastewater and the effects of dissolved organic and inorganic components on antibiotics adsorption process will be investigated declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

16161,struvite mgnh4po4 6h2o crystallization is a promising method of phosphorus recovery from wastewater as for digestive livestock wastewater the extensive residues of antibiotics could induce struvite recovery to spread antibiotic resistance and thereafter pose ecological risks to the environment in this study struvite crystals with different morphologies were produced from synthetic swine wastewater and tetracyclines tcs adsorbing capacities were investigated the important factors including the existence of mg2 ions and initial tcs concentration were examined the predominant adsorption between tcs and struvite crystals was electrostatic interaction with the maximum capacity at doxycycline dxc 876 5 μg kg oxytetracycline otc 1946 7 μg kg and tetracycline tc 2376 2 μg kg respectively well faceted struvite crystallites possessed high adsorption capacities than those of dendritic crystallite due to higher mg intensities on the crystallite surface the increment of phosphorus concentration could trigger the transformation of struvite morphology from needle to dendritic shapes with x shape as an intermediate stage which would reduce mg density in specific crystallite facets and therefore limit tcs adsorption onto struvite crystals the existence of mg2 ion would inhibit tcs deprotonation and thereafter improve tcs adsorption onto struvite crystals further investigation revealed that continuously elevating initial tcs concentration would promote the formation of 1 2 transferring to 1 1 tcs mg chelates which would result in a fluctuation following a drastic augment of tcs adsorption capacity graphical abstract graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords phosphorus recovery antibiotics struvite morphology tetracycline 1 introduction in the past decades rapid economic growth and urbanization in developing countries have engendered a massive demand for pig farming fu et al 2022 zhang et al 2022 according to the statistics released by the national bureau of statistics of china the annual production of pigs in china has reached approximately 527 million nbsprc 2021 consequently numerous intensive livestock farms are springing up with dramatic increases of nitrogen and phosphorus being discharged from livestock wastewater into the environment which has triggered public concern about the pollution around the world fu et al 2022 huang et al 2021 recently phosphorus recovery typically struvite mgnh4po4 6h2o crystallization from livestock wastewater has gained wide attention since it displays the big potential for nutrients recovery of phosphorus and nitrogen from wastewater and retards the scarcity of phosphorus rock resources worldwide liu et al 2021a nandre et al 2021 wang et al 2021b the recovered struvite can be utilized as a slow release fertilizer in agriculture directly due to its high nutrient contents liu et al 2021c shaddel et al 2020 veterinary antibiotics are extensively used in animal farming for therapy and growth promotor wang et al 2019 due to the poor assimilation of antibiotics in the animal guts about 30 90 of antibiotics are excreted as parent compounds or metabolites in feces and urine ma et al 2018 in addition antibiotics are hard to be degraded completely in wastewater treatment processes chen et al 2021 xu et al 2021 zainab et al 2020 with the reported removal rate ranging from 11 to 86 gros et al 2019 these suggested that the remained antibiotics in treated wastewater can threaten the ecological system by generating antibiotic resistance and spreading the antibiotic resistance genes chen et al 2020a elder et al 2021 long term exposure of antibiotics ultimately will pose potential risks to the environment as a family of broad spectrum antibiotics tetracyclines tcs are one of the extensive veterinary antibiotics utilized in the livestock industry for their beneficial cost effect and effective antimicrobial activities wang et al 2021a tcs have been detected with significant residue in livestock wastewater and the maximum concentrations can reach 685 6 μg l chen et al 2020b hu et al 2021 tcs are amphoteric molecules with multiple ionized groups including ketone amino hydroxyl and other functional groups tcs adsorbed by numerous adsorbents have been investigated and their main adsorption mechanisms include surface complexation bridging hydrophobic partitioning cation exchange and electrodonor acceptor interactions cheng et al 2016 liu et al 2021b yang et al 2021b with regard to struvite recovery from livestock wastewater the recovered products could adsorb antibiotics lou et al 2018 wang et al 2020 which therefore suggested that the recovered struvite present a threat to agricultural production and public health it should be pointed out that struvite generated under different conditions displayed different morphologies which are the key features of struvite properties and can therefore determine the efficiencies of struvite recovery by accelerating the settling velocity and improving the separation efficiency etc shaddel et al 2019 such variation of property might affect the antibiotic adsorption capacities however few studies have reported on this issue in this study struvite crystallization was performed under different conditions by using synthetic wastewater so as to obtain different morphologies and their adsorption capabilities on tcs were investigated besides the impacts of mg existence on the adsorption capacity of struvite crystals with various morphologies were estimated the outcomes will provide valuable information for controlling the key parameters of struvite formation to reduce antibiotic adsorption during phosphorous recovery process as well as for further studies of antibiotic transport behavior during struvite recovery from real swine wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and standards in this study three typical tcs standards including tetracycline tc oxytetracycline otc and doxycycline dxc were purchased from the alladin inc usa tetracycline d6 tc d6 as an internal standard for analysis was obtained from the tononto research chemicals inc canada the stock solutions of synthetic wastewater for struvite precipitation including 0 40 mol l nh4 2hpo4 and 0 48 mol l mgcl2 were prepared by dissolving nh4 2hpo4 and mgcl2 6h2o into ultrapure water respectively ultrapure water was generated by a milli q water purification system 18 2 ωm cm from millipore boston usa for the purpose of regulating ph value during struvite precipitation process 5 0 mol l naoh and 0 2 mol l hcl were utilized 2 2 experimental design and setup according to the literature ph value and phosphate concentration were the two key factors that determined struvite morphology muhmood et al 2021 prywer and torzewska 2009 ye et al 2011 in this study a series of experiments were conducted by using synthetic wastewater so as to investigate the variation of struvite morphologies and their impacts on tcs adsorption the operational conditions of struvite crystallization were conducted on the basis of our previous studies ye et al 2014 ye et al 2011 where struvite precipitation was performed homogeneously without seeds and the reaction time was set at 60 min with the agitation rate at 200 rpm in order to achieve high phosphorus recovery efficiency mg p molar ratios for struvite crystallization in the experiments were set at 1 2 1 the levels of ph value at 8 0 10 5 and phosphate concentration were determined by referencing the swine wastewater and sludge digestion supernatant as described in previous studies cheng et al 2019 muhmood et al 2021 ye et al 2011 the recovered products were pure struvite which were determined by the method on the basis of our previous studies ye et al 2014 ye et al 2011 the concentrations of tcs in this study were referred to the detected levels in the literature wang et al 2021a 2 2 1 influence of struvite morphology determined by ph variation it has been reported that ph variation can change the morphology of struvite crystals significantly prywer and torzewska 2009 in this section a series of experiments were conducted by setting initial phosphate concentration at 5 0 mmol l and ph values for struvite crystallization were adjusted to 8 0 8 5 9 0 9 5 10 0 and 10 5 respectively after struvite reaction crystalline precipitates were individually collected into several beakers and rinsed with pure water of corresponding ph values for three times so as to eliminate the interference of residual mg2 nh4 n and po4 3 p after that desired tcs contents were added into the beaker with pure water to reach 300 μg l and then subsequent adsorption experiment was carried out by setting ph value at 9 0 after agitation for 60 min the aqueous and solid samples were withdrawn for antibiotic analyses 2 2 2 influence of struvite morphology determined by different phosphate concentrations according to previous researches the changes of po4 3 ion concentrations can produce several morphologies of struvite crystals significantly different from those generated under various ph levels prywer and torzewska 2009 wang et al 2021b ye et al 2014 in this study struvite crystallization was achieved by keeping ph value at 9 0 and initial phosphate concentrations were adjusted at 3 5 4 5 5 5 6 5 7 5 8 5 and 9 5 mmol l respectively after the reaction crystalline products with different morphologies were collected into different beakers and rinsed with pure water for three times to exclude mg2 nh4 n and po4 3 p for the experiments of antibiotic adsorption the initial tcs concentration was designed as 250 μg l in order to keep the mass ratio of adsorbate tcs to adsorbent struvite crystals in every run at a constant value the working volumes of beakers were set at 1 000 1 286 1 517 1 857 2 429 and 2 714 l respectively by adding pure water antibiotic adsorption was performed by dosing desired amount of tcs into the beakers and ph value was kept at 9 0 constantly after agitation for 60 min the aqueous and solid samples were withdrawn for antibiotic analyses 2 2 3 effects of mg ion on tcs adsorption as described in previous studies aristilde et al 2016 carlotti et al 2012 mg2 can complex with tcs and therefore influence the transport behavior of tcs in the environment in the present study the existence of mg2 ion and its effects on tcs adsorption onto different morphological struvite crystals were investigated before struvite crystallization the initial phosphate concentration was set at 5 0 mmol l and tcs at 300 μg l subsequent struvite reaction was carried out by setting mg p molar ratio at 1 2 1 and ph value at 8 0 8 5 9 0 9 5 10 0 and 10 5 respectively the aqueous samples and precipitates were withdrawn for further analysis 2 2 4 effects of initial tcs concentration for struvite crystallization the dosage amount of magnesium source is normally excessive so as to guarantee the efficiency of phosphorus recovery however as a divalent cation mg2 can theoretically combine with tcs to form 1 1 and 1 2 tcs mg complexes aristilde et al 2016 carlotti et al 2012 which might fluctuate the quantity of struvite adsorbing antibiotics in case the concentrations of tcs in the wastewater change in this section the investigation of initial tcs concentration ranging from 100 μg l to 1000 μg l was conducted and struvite crystallization was performed at ph 9 0 with initial phosphorus concentration set at 4 0 mmol l and p n mg molar ratio at 1 2 1 2 respectively after the experiment the samples were withdrawn and subjected to solid and liquid separation the supernatants were further analyzed by uv vis spectrum to evaluate the interactions between tcs and mg2 ion and the solids were measured to determine tcs adsorption capacity 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 common methods ammonium nh4 n and phosphorus po4 3 p were respectively determined by nessler s reagent and phosphorus molybdenum blue spectrophotometry in accordance with the standard methods apha 1998 magnesium ion was assayed by the inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer optima 7000dv perkinelmer usa ph was measured by phs 3c probe 2 3 2 characterization methods the crystalline phases produced in struvite precipitation were analyzed with x ray diffractometer x pert prompd

horiba 7593 h japan the brunauer emmett teller bet surface area of struvite particles was determined by surface area and porosity analyzer micromeritics asap 2020 m c usa the complexation between tcs and magnesium ions was analyzed by uv vis spectrum persee tu 1810 china 2 3 3 antibiotics assay for solid samples they were collected and firstly freeze dried subsequently dosage of 10 v v hcl and ultrasonic extraction for 10 min to dissolve the solids were carried out solid phase extraction method xu et al 2013 was employed as the pretreatment method to concentrate tcs from the samples by using the oasis hlb cartridge 200 mg 6 ml waters milford usa afterwards the concentrates were subjected to liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms abi3200 qtrap usa combining with a phenomenex kinetex symmetry c18 column 2 1 mm 50 mm for antibiotics identification and quantitation the mass spectrometry system installed with electrospray ionization esi source was run in the positive mode with desolvation temperature at 300 c and capillary voltage 5 5 kv recovery rate and linearity were employed to evaluate the determination of tcs with lc ms ms detection limits and the quantification for the instrument were decided by using calibration curves as reported in the previous literature lou et al 2018 cai et al 2020 3 results and discussion 3 1 influence of morphological struvite with ph dependence to investigate the impacts of struvite crystal habits on tcs adsorption capacity different morphological struvite crystals were obtained by setting ph levels ranging from 8 0 to10 5 for struvite crystallization fig 1 showed sem images of struvite crystals with the increase of ph values struvite morphologies switched from the well faceted polyhedral structure to the dendrite structure finer tipped and smaller dendrite structures were observed at high ph values fig 2 demonstrated tcs adsorption capacities and bet surface areas corresponding to various morphological struvite crystals fig 1 the means of three antibiotic adsorption capacities were compared with the values of dxc 232 7 μg kg otc 224 7 μg kg and tc 282 4 μg kg respectively a stepwise increase of bet surface areas of struvite was observed while tcs adsorption capacities of struvite displayed a distinct profile fig 2 a to d with the maximum values dxc 359 3 μg kg otc 387 5 μg kg tc 379 4 μg kg on the crystals obtained at ph 8 0 fig 2a this unmatching relationship indicated that the tcs adsorption capacity might be determined by the intrinsic property of struvite crystals unreported it has been reported that the lattice structure of struvite particle comprises nh4 and po4 3 tetrahedral mg h2o 6 2 octahedral and the rectangular ac or bc crystallite facets are rich in mg h2o 6 2 with positive charge prywer and torzewska 2009 ye et al 2014 as for tcs they are hydrophilic compounds with three dissociated groups including tricarbonyl group tcs1 pka1 phenolic diketone moiety tcs2 pka2 and dimethylamino group tcs3 pka3 pollard and morra 2018 yue et al 2019 as described in the literature the adsorption mechanisms of tcs include hydrogen bonding electron donor acceptor π π dispersion interaction and electrostatic interaction which were ph dependant martins et al 2015 stylianou et al 2021 vakh et al 2021 yang et al 2011 in case ph level was enhanced to 9 0 i e alkaline conditions for struvite crystallization electrostatic interaction would be predominant this was because under such circumstance all the function groups were deprotonation and the tcs molecules were negatively charged han et al 2020 li et al 2021b as to struvite crystal it possessed hemimorphic morphology with unsymmetrical planes figure s1 prywer and torzewska 2009 which indicated that different crystallite faces possessed different magnesium densities it has been reported that mg contents are rich in struvite crystallite faces of 010 101 011 and 012 with different mg2 densities of 4 258 μmol m2 4 100 μmol m2 1 944 μmol m2 and 2 872 μmol m2 respectively li et al 2015 li et al 2021a figure s2 illustrated struvite molecules on 010 face of struvite crystallite where the green octahedral represented mg h2o 6 2 group in the present study the peak intensity of xrd diffraction in these crystallite faces was recorded fig 3 according to our previous researches ye et al 2011 shen et al 2015 the crystalline mineral formed was struvite it should be pointed out that the crystallinity of struvite was not significantly influenced by ph and mg existence as shown in fig 3 mg contents in different morphological struvite crystallites were calculated as present in table 1 it should be noted that mg contents of well faceted crystals were matching with the variation of tcs adsorption capacities such outcome was significant since it not only confirmed that mg h2o 6 2 octahedral in struvite crystal was prone to adsorb antibiotics through electrostatic interaction as described in the above text but also revealed that the crystallite morphology mg contents of struvite played a significant role on tcs adsorption capacity it should be pointed out that high mg contents in struvite crystallites produced at ph 10 0 table 1 e column and ph 10 5 table 1 f column didn t result in dramatic increment of tcs adsorption capacities as shown in fig 2 as described in the literature higher ph values would increase the supersaturation degree of struvite crystallization and improve negative zeta potential in the solution which would lead to the struvite crystal growth of dendrite structure with small size fig 1 e and f due to the enhancement of electrostatic repulsion among crystallites prywer and torzewska 2009 shaddel et al 2020 ye et al 2014 considering tcs negatively charged under alkaline condition li et al 2021b the increment of negative repulsion onto struvite crystals might offset a certain amount of tcs adsorption despite the increase of bet surface areas of crystals in the last two runs fig 2 3 2 influence of morphological struvite determined by phosphate concentration in this part struvite crystals with different morphological shapes were obtained by setting initial phosphate concentrations for struvite crystallization from 3 5 to 9 5 mmol l and their tc adsorption capacities were investigated fig 4 demonstrated the sem images of the struvite crystals in the case of phosphate concentrations higher than 7 5 mmol l the major morphology of struvite crystal kept needle shapes while a certain amount of x shapes were observed fig 4 e f and g as to tcs adsorption capacity it demonstrated a similar profile with bet surface areas corresponding to different morphological shapes of struvite crystals fig 5 where the profiles firstly displayed a gradual increase to initial phosphorus concentration at 5 5 mmol l following with a stable stage in this stage tcs possessed the maximum adsorption capacities at dxc 509 0 μg kg otc 841 7 μg kg and tc 951 6 μg kg respectively a further simultaneous decline of tcs adsorption capacities and bet surface areas were observed according to previous studies higher phosphorus concentrations in struvite crystallization created higher degrees of supersaturation condition and thereafter more formation of crystal nuclei and spontaneous aggregation could be generated prywer and torzewska 2009 shaddel et al 2019 ye et al 2014 moreover excess supersaturation by increasing phosphorus concentration could trigger the transformation of struvite morphology from needle to dendritic shapes with x shape as an intermediate stage shaddel et al 2019 as displayed in figure 4 the occurrence of x shape morphology indicated the formation of twin crystals assembling along the direction of 001 crystallite face li et al 2015 liu and qu 2017 manzoor et al 2018 which would squeeze and destruct the formation of 012 or 011 crystallite planes shaddel et al 2019 this was confirmed by the xrd spectra figure s3 where the intensity of 011 and 012 faces rich in mg density were significantly reduced such results suggested that the appearance of x shape morphology would limit the exposure of mg containing crystallite surface and therefore a matching trend of decrease of tcs adsorption capacities and bet surface areas was observed in fig 5 3 3 effects of mg ions existence to investigate mg2 influences on different morphological struvite crystal adsorbing tcs struvite crystallization was conducted at different ph values ranging from 8 0 to 10 5 with excessive magnesium existence the adsorption capacities were depicted in fig 6 although similar struvite morphologies were observed as those presented in fig 1 obvious distinctions on tcs adsorption capacities were detected compared to those determined in pure water fig 2 the profile of tcs adsorption capacity displayed a stable stage when ph was below 9 0 once ph value was enhanced up to 9 5 a steady increase of tcs adsorption capacity could be obtained fig 6 with the maximum values of dxc 532 1 μg kg otc 595 1 μg kg and tc 1136 0 μg kg these levels were significantly higher than those of dxc 359 3 μg kg otc 387 5 μg kg and tc 379 4 μg kg displayed in fig 2 respectively such discrimination suggested that the existence of magnesium ion in the liquor made an important contribution to tcs adsorption capacity as described in the above section struvite crystallite faces with different surficial magnesium densities possessed different tcs adsorption capacities which was based on the function of electrostatic repulsion in alkaline conditions however the comparison of tcs adsorption data in fig 6 to those in fig 2 revealed that the presence of excessive mg2 ion could improve tcs adsorption especially when ph was above 9 5 thereafter the interaction between mg2 and tcs was examined by evaluating the changes of uv vis spectrum as shown in fig 7 the co existence of mg ion with tcs resulted in peak shift and amplified the absorbance intensities the absorbance intensities of characteristic peaks of tc were enhanced from 0 865 to 0 985 and 0 890 to 1 208 otc from 0 919 to 0 992 and 1 007 to 1 193 and dxc from 0 955 to 1 339 respectively such peak amplification confirmed that mg2 could chelate with tcs to form antibiotic metal complexes chang et al 2013 yang et al 2021a zhou et al 2020 according to the literature tcs are a type of hydrophilic compounds with three dissociated groups i e tricarbonyl group tcs1 pka1 phenolic diketone moiety tcs2 pka2 and dimethylamino group tcs3 pka3 pollard and morra 2018 yue et al 2019 the protonation or deprotonation of tcs molecules is ph dependent take otc as an example the dissociation constants pka of otc1 otc2 and otc3 are 3 57 7 49 and 9 44 respectively han et al 2020 which suggests that otc molecular conformation will be negatively 7 49 ph 9 44 or much more negatively ph 9 44 charged in alkaline conditions accordingly the interaction of electrostatic repulsion between tcs and struvite crystals was predominant it should be noted that mg2 ion was prone to react with tcs at the functional groups of phenolic diketone moiety and dimethylamino group subsequently to form antibiotic metal complexes aristilde et al 2016 chang et al 2013 which was also supported by the profile variation in fig 7 this indicated that excessive mg2 would inhibit tcs deprotonation and thereafter improve the negative potential of tcs consequently struvite crystals were liable to adsorb tcs molecules and the steady increase of tcs adsorption capacity matching with ph enhancement was observed fig 6 3 4 effects of initial tcs concentration the investigation of initial tcs concentration on struvite adsorbing antibiotics at the existence of excessive mg2 was performed as demonstrated in fig 8 a gradual enhancement of tcs adsorption capacities was obtained while a following decline was observed once the initial tcs concentration reached 550 μg l drastic increase was detected when the initial tcs concentration was at 1000 μg l with the maximum adsorption capacities of dxc 876 5 μg kg otc 1946 7 μg kg and tc 2376 2 μg kg respectively as described in the about text the hydrophilic tcs possess three functional groups which can dissociate under different ph values for the neutral and alkalescent situations tcs possess three species i e free tcs mono tcsh and dianions tcs2 li et al 2021b vakh et al 2021 as the external source for struvite precipitation mg2 ion is prone to complex with tcs on phenolic diketone moiety tcs2 pka2 and dimethylamino group tcs3 pka3 subsequently to form 1 1 and 1 2 tcs mg chelates aristilde et al 2016 carlotti et al 2012 zhou et al 2020 such complexation suggests that mg2 ion has competitive effects with struvite crystals to chelate tcs molecules and might improve or inhibit tcs adsorption onto struvite crystals in this study the elevation of initial tcs concentration from 100 μg l to 550 μg l resulted in the increase of tcs adsorption capacity fig 8 which indicated that mg2 ion was excessive and could combine with tcs to form 1 2 tcs mg chelates carlotti et al 2012 zhou et al 2020 this could be supported by the variation of uv vis spectrum figure s4 where the profiles of low initial tcs concentrations displayed high absorbance intensities therefore tcs deprotonation was inhibited resulting in the increase of tcs negative potential consequently struvite crystals were liable to adsorb tcs molecules it should be noted that the further enhancement of tcs concentration from 550 μg l to 850 μg l resulted in a decline of tcs adsorption capacity this was because the chelation between mg2 and dimethylamino group in tcs molecules was unsaturated and the predominant species was 1 1 tcs mg complex monoanion tcsh with less hydrophobicity wessels et al 1998 the more initial tcs content had the less percentage of tcs chelated with mg2 and more free hydrophobic tcs molecules existed in the liquid carlotti et al 2012 wessels et al 1998 zhou et al 2020 therefore a drastic augment of tcs adsorption was observed at the initial tcs concentration at 1000 μg l 4 conclusion this study was conducted to investigate the adsorption behavior of tcs onto different morphological struvite crystals which were formed in synthetic livestock wastewater the effects of mg ions existence and initial tcs concentration were also investigated the predominant adsorption between tcs and struvite crystals was electrostatic interaction with the maximum capacity at dxc 876 5 μg kg otc 1946 7 μg kg and tc 2376 2 μg kg respectively well faceted struvite crystallites possessed higher adsorption capacities than those of dendritic crystallite due to higher mg intensities on the crystallite surface the enhancement of phosphorus concentration could trigger the transformation of struvite morphology from needle to dendritic shapes with x shape as an intermediate stage which would reduce mg density in specific crystallite facets and therefore limit tcs adsorption onto struvite crystals the existence of mg2 ion would inhibit tcs deprotonation and thereafter improve tcs adsorption onto struvite crystals further investigation revealed that continuously elevating initial tcs concentration would promote the formation of 1 2 tcs mg chelates transferring to 1 1 tcs mg chelates which would result in a fluctuation following a drastic augment of tcs adsorption capacity further experiments will be extended to struvite recovery in the real swine wastewater and the effects of dissolved organic and inorganic components on antibiotics adsorption process will be investigated declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

16162,manganese oxide mnox mediated ammonium nh4 oxidation in wetlands is receiving increased interest however the biochemical mechanisms of this process are vague due to only few studies have focused on terrestrial ecosystems in this study three subsurface flow constructed wetlands cws high low content of mn sand cw hmn cw lmn cw and quartz sand cw c cws were set up to explore the extent of ammonium nitrogen nh4 n removal and underlying mechanisms according to the surface characteristics of mn sand mnox nanospheres were loaded as birnessite on the sand while changes of the mn n contents indicated involvement of mn sand in nh4 n removal during the 120 day operation higher extent of nh4 n removal with decreased nitrous oxide n2o emission was achieved in the hmn cw 76 than in the lmn cw 73 and c cw 67 according to the distribution of nitrogen compounds and mn2 mn sand in the hmn cw delayed oxidation of nh4 and production of nitrate and nitrite high abundance of zooloea and psychrobacter was observed in the mn sand layer of hmn cw corresponding to a higher observed nh4 n removal nh4 oxidation to hydroxylamine and then to nitrite was enhanced in hmn cw due to ammonia monooxygenase genes being promoted the decrease of n2o emission was closely related to the genus tm7a verified by pearson correlation analysis our findings expand the knowledge of mnox mediated nh4 oxidation in wetlands and support the potential application of manganese oxide for effective nitrogen removal in cws graphical abstract graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords constructed wetlands ammonium manganese oxide psychrobacter zooloea n2o emission 1 introduction eutrophication a major pollution problem threatening waterbodies worldwide is a process triggered by excessive ammonium nitrogen nh4 n and phosphorus generally under hypoxia the key limiting factor for the removal of nh4 n is the lack of electron acceptor srivastava et al 2020 recently several researchers have proposed the existence of a novel alternative anoxic process to traditional ammonium oxidation utilizing mineral oxides as electron acceptors such as iron oxide feox and manganese oxide mnox wu et al 2019 yang et al 2020 metal oxide mediated nitrogen cycling was originally discovered in marine ecosystems however more studies should be focused on terrestrial ecosystems such as agricultural soils and wetland sediments due to excessive loads of nh4 n from anthropogenic activities shuai and jaffe 2019 compared to feox mnox has a lower zero electric point 1 5 4 6 and 5 or 6 times higher utilization efficiency in microbial metabolism chen et al 2020b till now mnox mn3 mn4 mediated nh4 n removal has been classified into two main pathways coupled with nitrification and mediated anaerobic ammonium oxidation mnammox desireddy and pothanamkandathil chacko 2021 for the first pathway in which mnox reduction is coupled with nitrification mediated by mn reducing bacteria originally occurred in the pore water of marine sediments desireddy et al 2017 mnammox is a recently proposed pathway in which mnox acts as a direct electron acceptor for anoxic ammonium nh4 oxidation to produce n2 similar to anammox and feammox mnammox is an alternative pathway of nitrogen loss from soils at 0 4 0 8 mg n kg d chen et al 2020b meanwhile this process prevents the production of nitrous oxide n2o an intermediate greenhouse gas hence more attention has been paid to terrestrial ecosystems since mnammox was proposed recently manganese oxide and manganese ore have also been used as substrates in constructed wetlands cws to enhance pollutant elimination enhanced nh4 n removal and reduced n2o emission have been reported wang et al 2022 yang et al 2019c zhang et al 2019 nevertheless the biochemical mechanisms are controversial desireddy and pothanamkandathil chacko 2021 though chemical or abiotic reactions were originally regarded as involved in the pathways little evidence directly shows and distinguishes biological and chemical processes bryce et al 2018 in addition the potential microbial mechanisms were not reported when mnammox was proposed chen et al 2020b metal reducing bacteria are generally considered as dominant species due to similar properties of mnammox and feammox xin et al 2017 however the proposed process includes complex mechanisms that have not been fully explored zhang et al 2020 notably mn oxidizing bacteria have been reported to potentially participate in nitrogen cycling wang et al 2021 moreover nitrifying microorganisms played a certain role in mn ore cws zhang et al 2019 which is different from the observed inhibition of nitrification in the feammox process wu et al 2019 in summary the exact mechanisms of mnox mediated nh4 n removal are still unclear to explore the biochemical process of mnox mediated nh4 oxidation in cws the main objectives of this study were 1 to identify changes of mnox characteristics in nitrogen removal through examining the surface morphology and functional groups of prepared birnessite coated quartz sand mn sand before and after the experiments 2 to investigate the transformation of nitrogen compounds through analysis of water quality and n2o emission over time and along the cws height and 3 to elucidate the biological mechanism of mnox mediated nitrogen removal through analysis of the crucial microbial species and functional enzymes in the nitrogen metabolism pathway the results of this study could provide detailed information on the mechanisms of mnox mediated nh4 n removal in cws 2 materials and methods 2 1 synthesis and characterization of birnessite coated sand birnessite coated quartz sand mn sand was colligated by mixing 600 g concentrated hydrochloric acid hcl washed quartz

for 10 min the solids were filtered and rinsed with deionized water after freeze drying the synthetic mn sand was obtained further quantities of mn sand were produced by following the same procedure xie et al 2018 a scanning electron microscope sem zeiss gemini 300 germany was employed to visualize the surface morphology of original quartz sand and mn sand before and after the experiment energy disperse spectroscopy eds was utilized using oxford xplore britain with a working distance of 8 5 mm elemental mapping of mn and oxygen o in the samples was recorded and the elemental composition of mn and o was further analyzed by eds the surface functional groups of the quartz sand and mn sand were also determined utilizing a fourier transform infrared radiation ftir spectrometer irprestige 21 japan using the kbr pellet method with wavelength range 4000 to 400 cm 1 2 2 setup and operation of lab scale constructed wetlands three lab scale vertical subsurface flow cws were constructed with acrylic cylinders diameter of 20 cm and length of 60 cm fig s1 supplementary material the cws contained three layers of substrate two gravel layers and a middle layer the middle layer was filled with mn sand high content of mnox cws hmn cw mn sand and quartz sand at a volume ratio of 1 1 low content of mnox cws lmn cw or quartz sand control cw c cw outlets with an interval of 10 cm were set in each cw to collect effluent at various heights three sampling sites were set at the middle height of each layer in each cw for removing substrate for measurements fig s1 unbrella plant cyperus involucratus rottb is a common genus of wetland plant species in southern china which is competitive and tolerant in eutrophic habitats in this study healthy unbrella plant was selected as the wetland plant with similar growth conditions used at a density of 100 plants m2 the cws were housed in the laboratory maintained at ca 20 c for the initial month the supernatant of secondary sludge was the influent for microbial inoculation for each cw 6 l synthetic influent was fed into the system the influent consisted of 30 5 mg l ammonia chloride nh4cl 4 5 mg l monobasic potassium phosphate kh2po4 and 56 3 mg l glucose c6h12o6 as well as micronutrients cheng et al 2021a the influent chemical oxygen demand cod nh4 n and total phosphorus tp concentrations were 60 8 and 1 mg l chosen to simulate secondary effluent of municipal wastewater treatment plants all reagents used were of analytical grade the hydraulic retention time hrt of all systems was set at 7 d then reduced to 5 d and finally to 3 d the study lasted for nearly 6 months at the end of the study substrate of each layer from all cws was removed through sampling sites fig s1 fully mixed and then used for microbial analysis all samples were stored at 80 c and then used for further analysis 2 3 sampling and analysis the influent and bottom effluent nh4 n nitrate nitrogen no3 n nitrite nitrogen no2 n and cod were measured according to standard methods every three days cheng et al 2021a mn2 was measured using a colorimetric method hallberg and johnson 2005 after the concentrations of the effluent components were stable effluent from different cw heights was collected and analyzed for one cycle in the period of a typical cycle the effluent was collected every 12 h the n2o emission flux was determined utilizing a stationary chamber method for nitrogen mass balance calculation cheng et al 2021a dissolved oxygen do ph and oxidation reduction potential orp were monitored using a hq series portable meter hach hq2200 usa equipped with do ldo10103 and ph phc10103 probes to determine n2o emission flux a plastic gas shade diameter of 22 5 cm and length of 100 cm with a water seal covered the cw surface gas samples were gathered every 2 h via a pump the n2o flux was determined based on the gas concentration measured by gas chromatography unit gc 2010 plus shimadzu japan with an electron capture detector ecd cheng et al 2021a 2 4 microbial community analysis at the end of the study the substrate in each wetland system was used for microbial community analysis biofilm which covered the substrate was

sequences have been submitted to the ncbi database archived in prjna783068 under the accession numbers of samn23415997 23416005 functional annotation of prokaryotic taxa faprotax and tax4fun were employed to predict functions of the microorganisms the prediction of faprotax was obtained from the normalized contig based 16s rrna otu table annotated in the prokaryotic environmental functions database galand et al 2018 tax4fun predictions were based on silva labeled otu abundances aßhauer et al 2015 the normalized taxonomic abundances were used to linearly combine the precomputed functional profiles in the kegg database the kegg pathway database was used to investigate the nitrogen metabolic pathway in the experimental cws cheng et al 2021b microbial functional genes of the nitrogen metabolism were quantified by qpcr the detailed conditions and primers are described in table s1 zhou et al 2021 the qpcr reactions were performed on the real time pcr system roche lightcycler 480 ii usa all samples were analyzed in triplicate each 20 μl reaction mixture included 10 μl of takara sybr premix ex taq takara bio inc shiga japan 0 2 μm of each primer and 1 μl dna

using r software the structural equation model was constructed using amos version 21 as described in text s1 chen et al 2020a analysis of variance within and between groups anova was performed with ibm spss statistics 24 0 software 3 results and discussion 3 1 chemical characteristic changes of mn sand and quartz sand 3 1 1 characteristics of quartz sand before and after mn loaded the surface appearance and chemical composition of quartz sand before and after loading birnessite were obtained from elemental mapping by sem eds fig 1 and table s2 compared with the original quartz sand fig 1a the formed nanosphere fig 1b which is in agreement with the earlier reported synthesis of birnessite type mno2 nanosphere indicated loading of birnessite on the sand ming et al 2012 the diameter of the nanosphere was in the range of 200 500 nm at a magnification of 100 k the cotton ball like particles seem to associate together to create a larger cluster matching a previous observation of octahedral layer structure cheney et al 2008 compared with quartz sand the mn content was significantly increased reaching 12 9 according to elemental mapping of mn sand fig 1d though the oxygen o content on the surface of mn sand 36 7 was slightly lower than that of quartz sand 41 3 the o elements were distributed throughout the surface of the mn sand this is supported by the elemental analysis of a specific mn sand nanosphere the molar ratio of o mn was 2 table s2 the ftir spectra of quartz sand and mn sand further confirmed the loading of birnessite fig s2 a strong absorption peak at around 520 cm 1 was observed in the mn sand sample attributed to vibrations of the octahedral structure jiang et al 2013 moreover the peak at about 773 cm 1 is assigned to the mn o mn bond cheng et al 2021d an absorption band revealing the mn o h bond peak is recognized at ca 1060 cm 1 seredych and bandosz 2012 3 1 2 characteristics of mn sand before and after cws operation to explore the structural difference between cws at the end of the study samples from the middle layer were extracted for sem eds analysis fig 1e g mn sand fig 1e f was significantly different from the quartz sand fig 1g at the end of the study concerning the mn sand in hmn cw the octahedral particles seem to associate together to create a larger cluster cover on the surface as for the mn sand from lmn cw several fluffy coralloid small balls were observed on the surface with a diameter of 1 5 μm at a larger magnification 100 k a fluffy layer structure combined with coralloid structure was observed due to biologically and physicochemically formed layered clusters within the coral or sponge structure bruins et al 2015 showed the diverse structures of biologically and physicochemically formed birnessite biologically formed birnessite had a feathery plate outlook while physicochemically formed birnessite had coral or sponge like structure the surface appearance enables birnessite to be easily involved in oxidation reduction processes in soil and groundwater post 1999 as illustrated in fig s2 c and d peaks around 2400 cm 1 were observed in cws filled with mn sand they could be assigned to reactions between mn sand and ammonium as groups of secondary and tertiary amines absorb in the region 2250 2700 cm 1 yadav 2005 in summary quartz sand loaded with birnessite favored interaction with ammonium 3 2 nitrogen removal and manganese oxide transformation 3 2 1 long term performance of cws to investigate the potential association between manganese oxide reduction and nh4 oxidation influent and effluent nh4 n concentration was frequently measured fig 2 a the whole experimental period was divided into four phases inoculation incubation hrt of 7d hrt of 5 d and hrt of 3 d the initial 48 d was regarded as an inoculation incubation period in which a low extent of nh4 n removal 50 was observed in all three cws the following three periods exhibited a higher extent of nh4 n removal in the hmn cw with an extent of 69 3 on the 7th day the mean extent of nh4 n removal of hmn cw 68 1 was higher than that of lmn cw 56 8 and c cw 59 3 then the hrt was lowered to 5 d after 4 cycles the extent of nh4 n removal of hmn cw reached 76 1 on the 5th day which was higher than that of lmn cw 73 4 and c cw 67 2 finally the hrt was lowered to 3 d the effluent nh4 n in hmn cw 1 90 mg l was lower than that in lmn cw 2 22 mg l and c cw 2 52 mg l in general nh4 n removal followed the order of hmn cw lmn cw c cw all three cws achieved relative high extent of cod removal 98 5 fig s3 and text s2 the nh4 n removal was mainly the result of anoxic biologically mediated nh4 oxidation in the presence of mnox chen et al 2020b nitrate no3 nitrite no2 and nitrogen gas n2 are products as shown in eqs 1 3 below in a previous study although enhanced denitrification and anoxic nitrification were observed in mn ore cws interactions of mnox and nh4 were obscure due to influent containing no3 which was also an intermediate product yang et al 2019c hence it is necessary to further investigate the transformation of nh4 n over time along the cw height in a typical cycle 1 4 mn o 2 n h 4 6 h 4 m n 2 n o 3 5 h 2 o 2 3 mn o 2 n h 4 4 h 3 m n 2 n o 2 4 h 2 o 3 3 mn o 2 2 n h 4 4 h 3 m n 2 n 2 6 h 2 o 3 2 2 changes of nitrogen compounds over time the nitrogen species in cws were analyzed during a typical cycle fig 3 for all systems the effluent nh4 n concentration steadily decreased over time fig 3a the removal extent was higher than 60 on day 3 compared to lmn cw and c cw the effluent nh4 n concentration of the hmn cw sharply decreased after 12 h the rate of nh4 n decrease in the lmn cw and c cw was comparatively moderate with an extent removal of 60 65 on day 3 accumulation and elimination of no3 n and no2 n are shown in fig 3b the effluent no3 n in all microcosms sharply decreased to less than 0 5 mg l finally reaching 0 1 mg l on day 3 notably no2 n accumulated between 24 and 36 h in the hmn cw while accumulated at 12 h in both lmn cw and c cw moreover the no2 n concentration in hmn cw 2 17 mg l and lmn cw 1 99 mg l was higher than that of c cw 0 75 mg l no2 was attributed as an intermediate of mn sand mediated nh4 oxidation wang et al 2021 this is also the reason for the higher extent of nh4 n removal in hmn cw as an intermediate of denitrification the n2o emission flux was measured fig 3c in general the higher n2o emission flux was obtained at 36 to 48 h c cw had the highest mean emission flux of 975 μg m2 h in a typical cycle thus mn sand decreased n2o emissions the highest emission flux was 354 and 629 μg m2 h in hmn cw and lmn cw respectively the mean emission flux of n2o in c cw was 416 μg m2 h which was higher than that of hmn cw 148 μg m2 h and lmn cw 186 μg m2 h n2o is not a product of mnox mediated nitrification or denitrification xu et al 2021a but it is an intermediate of microbial denitrification under hypoxia besides mn has been reported to promote anammox in a biofilter indicating elimination of n2o yang et al 2019a therefore the n2o emission flux results are attributed to promoted anoxic nitrification denitrification and anammox by mn sand layer in cws swathi et al 2017 xie et al 2018 according to n mass balance calculations shown in fig s4 mnox enhanced nh4 n removal the increasing accumulation of no2 n in 12 36 h of one typical cycle indicated the enhanced pathway of mnox mediated nh4 oxidation as shown in eq 2 the accumulation of no2 n in hmn cw was delayed to 24 36 h compared with other cws the low n2o emission implies enhanced denitrification and or anammox in hmn cws 3 2 3 diversity of nitrogen compounds along the cw height to further explore the nh4 n transformation nitrogen compounds along the cw height were measured in this study fig 2c the nh4 n concentration decreased from top to down at 0 5 h for all cws whereas the rate was different a higher reduction rate was observed in the lower 20 cm in hmn cw as opposed to the upper 30 cm in lmn cw and c cw the difference is attributed to filling with mn sand in the 10 30 cm layer from the bottom an increasing no3 n and no2 n concentration was observed at the height of 20 cm in hmn cw compared with lmn cw and c cw mn sand in hmn cw delayed the oxidation of nh4 and the production of no3 and no2 at 72 h neither no3 n nor no2 n was detected less than 0 1 mg l the nh4 n concentration along the cw height showed no significant difference the do orp and ph values along the cw height were measured fig s5 the do was 0 21 1 93 mg l below the height of 40 cm indicating anoxic conditions in the cws the surface do of the substrate was relative higher 1 12 3 08 mg l which was attributed to atmospheric o2 and or oxygenation by plant roots wang et al 2018 besides all monitored orp values were negative 79 7 29 3 mv indicating anoxic conditions the ph values did not vary significantly between the three cws ph values between 7 39 and 8 34 was reported to benefit manganese oxidizing bacteria hou et al 2020 zhao et al 2018 3 2 4 contribution of nitrogen compounds to mn transformation the mn2 concentration along the cw height and time is shown in figs 2b and 3b respectively the mn2 concentration was in the range of 0 2 to 1 0 mg l in hmn cw and lmn cw regarding lmn cw the mn2 concentration increased continuously from 0 14 to 0 90 mg l in one typical cycle whereas the mn2 concentration of mn cw declined from 0 56 to 0 26 mg l and then increased to 1 00 mg l interestingly the mean mn2 concentration was comparable in the two cws at ca 0 6 mg l generally the mn2 concentrations were higher than other reported concentrations of less than 0 098 mg l in vertical up flow cws with mnox xie et al 2018 in this previous research mn2 mediated denitrification occurred and mn2 was re oxidized desireddy and pothanamkandathil chacko 2021 besides biogenic mn oxides were proposed as the oxidation state of mn xie et al 2018 in our study lack of no3 limited mn2 re oxidation this phenomenon in turn indicates the feasibility of mnox for the simultaneous removal of nh4 n and no3 n the mn2 concentrations along the cw height at 0 5 and 72 h are shown in fig 2b in general the mean mn2 concentration at 0 5 h 0 1 mg l was lower than that at 72 h 0 45 mg l besides the mn2 concentration was extremely low at 0 02 mg l at the height of 50 cm regarding hmn cws the highest mn2 concentration of 0 71 to 0 76 mg l was observed at the height of 10 30 cm the mn2 concentration at the height of 10 30 cm of lmn cw was in the range of 0 43 to 0 63 mg l according to liu et al 2020 although the highest mn ii concentration was 35 42 mg l in the substrate of an mn rich cw the mn ii concentration in the outflow was only 1 45 mg l most mn ii was considered to be retained in the reactor due to cycling between mn iv and mn ii liu et al 2020 compared to mn ore the gravel layer seemed to perform poorly in terms of manganese removal in constructed wetlands xu et al 2009 we used a structural equation model analysis to further understand the shift of mn2 in cws in response to nitrogen transformation fig 2d the effect value of x2 df was less than 2 p was higher than 0 05 both gfi and cfi were close to 1 and rmsea was less than 0 08 indicating the excellent fit of the structural equation model text s1 according to the standardized coefficients nh4 n and no2 n were negatively correlated with mn2 concentration while n2o was positively correlated with mn2 concentration the coefficient between nh4 n and mn2 was the largest 0 82 indicating a significant and strong correlation 3 3 microbial community 3 3 1 changes of microbial community structure illumina sequencing was employed to distinguish and explore the diversity of bacterial community in cw systems as illustrated in fig 4 a proteobacteria 32 53 was the dominant phylum for all samples the highest relative abundance of proteobacteria was observed in the middle layer of hmn cw proteobacteria was identified as the most common phylum associated with nitrogen removal in sediments feng et al 2021 at the genus level zoogloea with a relative abundance of 13 6 was the highest in the middle layer of hmn cw fig 4b bai et al 2021 found zoogloea was always dominant and coincidental to no3 n and mn ii removal zoogloea is associated with denitrification and mn ii oxidation chang et al 2021 in our study the middle layer was filled with the mn sand which facilitated the enrichment of zoogloea the relative abundance of zoogloea in the middle layer of lmn cw was only 0 4 which is in accordance with that the abundance of zoogloea is negatively correlated with the amount of n2o produced xu et al 2021b thauera 1 9 6 8 was another genus at a relative high abundance in all samples thauera is a facultative denitrifying bacterium which could grow well and enriched under anaerobic conditions yang et al 2019b thauera was associated with nitrate reduction and nitrite accumulation hu et al 2021 the relative abundance of thauera also increased in vertical subsurface flow cws using minerals as substrate cheng et al 2021c notably the relative abundance of the genus tm7a was higher in hmn cw 6 0 and lmn cw 5 8 than in c cw 3 6 liu et al 2021 found tm7a in soils contaminated with heavy metals indicating that mn sand resulted in a higher abundance of tm7a moreover tm7a was involved in interactions of the carbon and nitrogen cycle rong et al 2021 remarkably the relative abundance of psychrobacter was higher in hmn cw especially in the mn layer 8 4 psychrobacter is an ammonium assimilating bacterium which is generally found in marine environments zhang et al 2021 thus the higher relative abundance of psychrobacter associated with mnox may indicate participation in nh4 n removal acinetobacter is a mn ii oxidizing bacterium found in a biofiltration system treating mn ii rich groundwater dangeti et al 2020 the relative abundance of acinetobacter was high in lmn cw 8 4 compared with mn coated quartz sand the mixture of mn sand and quartz sand may have facilitated the enrichment of acinetobacter su et al 2016 have confirmed the existence of no3 reduction and mn2 oxidation in a moving bed biofilm reactor with immobilized acinetobacter sp sz28 on plastic carrier media treating synthetic wastewater 3 3 2 quantification of nitrogen metabolism functional genes the abundance of 16s rrna total bacteria varied within 10 11 orders of magnitude and showed no significant difference between the three cws fig 5 the abundance of ammonia monooxygenase aob of the samples in the middle layer of hmn cw was significantly higher than that of lmn cw and c cw p 0 05 this result is in agreement with a previous study zhang et al 2019 which proposed nitrification related microorganisms also play a certain role in mn cws in addition to matrix adsorption the abundance of ammonia monooxygenase of archaea aoa in the middle layer of c cw was the highest nitrite oxidoreductase nxrb showed a relative high abundance especially at the middle and lower layers 3 21 1010 9 54 1010 copies g dry weight but showed no significant difference between the three cws p 0 05 as for the nitrate nitrite nitrous oxide reductase narg nirks nosz the abundance at the upper layer was significantly lower in hmn cw and lmn cw while the abundance in the three layers of c cw showed no significant difference 3 3 3 functional annotation faprotax and tax4fun were used to predict functions of the identified microorganisms generally cws containing mn sand were clustered into one group as illustrated in fig s6 the three layers in the hmn cw were far away from each other the mn sand layer increased nitrate reduction and respiration as well as nitrogen respiration moreover denitrification was enhanced in the hmn cw which is consistent with the above discussed nitrogen removal results as for the lmn cw manganese oxidation was enhanced in the upper layer which may be ascribed to higher mn2 concentration at the height of 40 cm as shown in figs 6 and s7 the abundance of functional genes and enzymes were classified and quantified based on the kegg database the abundance of nitrification genes amoabc and hao in the mn sand layer of hmn cw was much higher than in other samples indicating enhanced ammonium removal our results agree with those of previous reports yang et al 2019c but according to reports on feox mediated ammonium removal process ammonia monooxygenase genes were inhibited under feox amendment shuai and jaffe 2019 moreover the abundance of the denitrification gene narg 0 63 was higher than in other samples less than 0 55 the above results are consistent with the faprotax results in which an enhanced denitrification activity was found in hmn cw these results provide useful information to explain the higher nitrogen removal by the hmn cw relative to the lmn cw and c cw 3 4 potential mechanisms of mnox mediated ammonium removal 3 4 1 relationships between mn2 nitrogen compounds and microorganisms the relationships between nitrogen manganese ion and microorganisms were evaluated and indexes are shown in fig 4c and s8 there is a highly significant positive correlation between nh4 n and n2o emission p 0 01 besides the nh4 n concentration showed a significantly negative correlation with mn2 p 0 05 no2 n and orp showed a positive correlation p 0 05 whereas the correlation between no2 n and do was not significant fig s8 this result is consistent with previous reports which proposed enhanced anoxic nitrification by mnox swathi et al 2017 n2o emission was negatively correlated with the genus tm7a p 0 01 confirming the above stated conjecture that mn2 could not effectively be re oxidized by manganese oxidizing bacteria in this study notably zoogloea and psychrobacter showed a positive correlation p 0 05 indicating coexistence and participation in nitrogen metabolism psychrobacter was related to ammonium assimilation zhang et al 2021 while zoogloea was involved in mn2 mediated denitrification chang et al 2021 coexistence and high tolerance to salt concentrations of zoogloea and psychrobacter have been reported in an aerobic granular sludge system wang et al 2017 thauera is positively correlated with n2o emission which is consistent with a previous report cheng et al 2021c 3 4 2 potential metabolism mechanisms the enzymes related to ammonium metabolic processes according to the kegg database were quantified and shown in fig 7 notably the transformation of nh4 to hydroxylamine nh2oh and then to no2 was enhanced in hmn cw this transformation is different from feammox in which ammonia monooxygenase was inhibited in incubations amended with c2h2 huang and jaffé 2015 these researchers ascribed feox mediated ammonia oxidation as a unique pathway in which the acidimicrobiaceae family played a key role besides we observed enhanced denitrification mediated by mn2 this observation is in accordance with that of xie et al 2018 who proposed mn cycle in cws our results complement particular metabolic processes mediated by mnox in nitrogen transformation 4 conclusions in this study birnessite coated quartz sand mn sand was prepared and used as the substrate in cws cws filled with high content of mn sand achieved a higher extent of ammonium removal ammonium removal and n2o emission was closely related to the mn2 concentration ammonia monooxygenase genes amoabc hao were promoted in mnox mediated ammonium oxidation while nitrate reductase narg was enhanced in the mn2 mediated denitrification process the relative abundance of zooloea and psychrobacter was very high in hmn cw playing a key role in ammonium removal and denitrification credit

16162,manganese oxide mnox mediated ammonium nh4 oxidation in wetlands is receiving increased interest however the biochemical mechanisms of this process are vague due to only few studies have focused on terrestrial ecosystems in this study three subsurface flow constructed wetlands cws high low content of mn sand cw hmn cw lmn cw and quartz sand cw c cws were set up to explore the extent of ammonium nitrogen nh4 n removal and underlying mechanisms according to the surface characteristics of mn sand mnox nanospheres were loaded as birnessite on the sand while changes of the mn n contents indicated involvement of mn sand in nh4 n removal during the 120 day operation higher extent of nh4 n removal with decreased nitrous oxide n2o emission was achieved in the hmn cw 76 than in the lmn cw 73 and c cw 67 according to the distribution of nitrogen compounds and mn2 mn sand in the hmn cw delayed oxidation of nh4 and production of nitrate and nitrite high abundance of zooloea and psychrobacter was observed in the mn sand layer of hmn cw corresponding to a higher observed nh4 n removal nh4 oxidation to hydroxylamine and then to nitrite was enhanced in hmn cw due to ammonia monooxygenase genes being promoted the decrease of n2o emission was closely related to the genus tm7a verified by pearson correlation analysis our findings expand the knowledge of mnox mediated nh4 oxidation in wetlands and support the potential application of manganese oxide for effective nitrogen removal in cws graphical abstract graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords constructed wetlands ammonium manganese oxide psychrobacter zooloea n2o emission 1 introduction eutrophication a major pollution problem threatening waterbodies worldwide is a process triggered by excessive ammonium nitrogen nh4 n and phosphorus generally under hypoxia the key limiting factor for the removal of nh4 n is the lack of electron acceptor srivastava et al 2020 recently several researchers have proposed the existence of a novel alternative anoxic process to traditional ammonium oxidation utilizing mineral oxides as electron acceptors such as iron oxide feox and manganese oxide mnox wu et al 2019 yang et al 2020 metal oxide mediated nitrogen cycling was originally discovered in marine ecosystems however more studies should be focused on terrestrial ecosystems such as agricultural soils and wetland sediments due to excessive loads of nh4 n from anthropogenic activities shuai and jaffe 2019 compared to feox mnox has a lower zero electric point 1 5 4 6 and 5 or 6 times higher utilization efficiency in microbial metabolism chen et al 2020b till now mnox mn3 mn4 mediated nh4 n removal has been classified into two main pathways coupled with nitrification and mediated anaerobic ammonium oxidation mnammox desireddy and pothanamkandathil chacko 2021 for the first pathway in which mnox reduction is coupled with nitrification mediated by mn reducing bacteria originally occurred in the pore water of marine sediments desireddy et al 2017 mnammox is a recently proposed pathway in which mnox acts as a direct electron acceptor for anoxic ammonium nh4 oxidation to produce n2 similar to anammox and feammox mnammox is an alternative pathway of nitrogen loss from soils at 0 4 0 8 mg n kg d chen et al 2020b meanwhile this process prevents the production of nitrous oxide n2o an intermediate greenhouse gas hence more attention has been paid to terrestrial ecosystems since mnammox was proposed recently manganese oxide and manganese ore have also been used as substrates in constructed wetlands cws to enhance pollutant elimination enhanced nh4 n removal and reduced n2o emission have been reported wang et al 2022 yang et al 2019c zhang et al 2019 nevertheless the biochemical mechanisms are controversial desireddy and pothanamkandathil chacko 2021 though chemical or abiotic reactions were originally regarded as involved in the pathways little evidence directly shows and distinguishes biological and chemical processes bryce et al 2018 in addition the potential microbial mechanisms were not reported when mnammox was proposed chen et al 2020b metal reducing bacteria are generally considered as dominant species due to similar properties of mnammox and feammox xin et al 2017 however the proposed process includes complex mechanisms that have not been fully explored zhang et al 2020 notably mn oxidizing bacteria have been reported to potentially participate in nitrogen cycling wang et al 2021 moreover nitrifying microorganisms played a certain role in mn ore cws zhang et al 2019 which is different from the observed inhibition of nitrification in the feammox process wu et al 2019 in summary the exact mechanisms of mnox mediated nh4 n removal are still unclear to explore the biochemical process of mnox mediated nh4 oxidation in cws the main objectives of this study were 1 to identify changes of mnox characteristics in nitrogen removal through examining the surface morphology and functional groups of prepared birnessite coated quartz sand mn sand before and after the experiments 2 to investigate the transformation of nitrogen compounds through analysis of water quality and n2o emission over time and along the cws height and 3 to elucidate the biological mechanism of mnox mediated nitrogen removal through analysis of the crucial microbial species and functional enzymes in the nitrogen metabolism pathway the results of this study could provide detailed information on the mechanisms of mnox mediated nh4 n removal in cws 2 materials and methods 2 1 synthesis and characterization of birnessite coated sand birnessite coated quartz sand mn sand was colligated by mixing 600 g concentrated hydrochloric acid hcl washed quartz

for 10 min the solids were filtered and rinsed with deionized water after freeze drying the synthetic mn sand was obtained further quantities of mn sand were produced by following the same procedure xie et al 2018 a scanning electron microscope sem zeiss gemini 300 germany was employed to visualize the surface morphology of original quartz sand and mn sand before and after the experiment energy disperse spectroscopy eds was utilized using oxford xplore britain with a working distance of 8 5 mm elemental mapping of mn and oxygen o in the samples was recorded and the elemental composition of mn and o was further analyzed by eds the surface functional groups of the quartz sand and mn sand were also determined utilizing a fourier transform infrared radiation ftir spectrometer irprestige 21 japan using the kbr pellet method with wavelength range 4000 to 400 cm 1 2 2 setup and operation of lab scale constructed wetlands three lab scale vertical subsurface flow cws were constructed with acrylic cylinders diameter of 20 cm and length of 60 cm fig s1 supplementary material the cws contained three layers of substrate two gravel layers and a middle layer the middle layer was filled with mn sand high content of mnox cws hmn cw mn sand and quartz sand at a volume ratio of 1 1 low content of mnox cws lmn cw or quartz sand control cw c cw outlets with an interval of 10 cm were set in each cw to collect effluent at various heights three sampling sites were set at the middle height of each layer in each cw for removing substrate for measurements fig s1 unbrella plant cyperus involucratus rottb is a common genus of wetland plant species in southern china which is competitive and tolerant in eutrophic habitats in this study healthy unbrella plant was selected as the wetland plant with similar growth conditions used at a density of 100 plants m2 the cws were housed in the laboratory maintained at ca 20 c for the initial month the supernatant of secondary sludge was the influent for microbial inoculation for each cw 6 l synthetic influent was fed into the system the influent consisted of 30 5 mg l ammonia chloride nh4cl 4 5 mg l monobasic potassium phosphate kh2po4 and 56 3 mg l glucose c6h12o6 as well as micronutrients cheng et al 2021a the influent chemical oxygen demand cod nh4 n and total phosphorus tp concentrations were 60 8 and 1 mg l chosen to simulate secondary effluent of municipal wastewater treatment plants all reagents used were of analytical grade the hydraulic retention time hrt of all systems was set at 7 d then reduced to 5 d and finally to 3 d the study lasted for nearly 6 months at the end of the study substrate of each layer from all cws was removed through sampling sites fig s1 fully mixed and then used for microbial analysis all samples were stored at 80 c and then used for further analysis 2 3 sampling and analysis the influent and bottom effluent nh4 n nitrate nitrogen no3 n nitrite nitrogen no2 n and cod were measured according to standard methods every three days cheng et al 2021a mn2 was measured using a colorimetric method hallberg and johnson 2005 after the concentrations of the effluent components were stable effluent from different cw heights was collected and analyzed for one cycle in the period of a typical cycle the effluent was collected every 12 h the n2o emission flux was determined utilizing a stationary chamber method for nitrogen mass balance calculation cheng et al 2021a dissolved oxygen do ph and oxidation reduction potential orp were monitored using a hq series portable meter hach hq2200 usa equipped with do ldo10103 and ph phc10103 probes to determine n2o emission flux a plastic gas shade diameter of 22 5 cm and length of 100 cm with a water seal covered the cw surface gas samples were gathered every 2 h via a pump the n2o flux was determined based on the gas concentration measured by gas chromatography unit gc 2010 plus shimadzu japan with an electron capture detector ecd cheng et al 2021a 2 4 microbial community analysis at the end of the study the substrate in each wetland system was used for microbial community analysis biofilm which covered the substrate was obtained using 0 1 mol l phosphate buffer saline pbs with 2 h sonication and 10 min centrifugation at 8000 rpm the pellets were used for microbial community analysis dna samples were extracted and diluted to 1 ng μl diluted dna was amplified utilizing primers of 515f 5 gtgccagcmgccgcggtaa 3 and 806r 5 ggactahvgggtwtctaat 3 after qualified and quantified the pcr products were purified to generate sequencing libraries finally the library was sequenced on illumina platform novaseq 6000 illumina san diego usa the gene sequencing was performed by novogene co ltd beijing china the obtained sequences have been submitted to the ncbi database archived in prjna783068 under the accession numbers of samn23415997 23416005 functional annotation of prokaryotic taxa faprotax and tax4fun were employed to predict functions of the microorganisms the prediction of faprotax was obtained from the normalized contig based 16s rrna otu table annotated in the prokaryotic environmental functions database galand et al 2018 tax4fun predictions were based on silva labeled otu abundances aßhauer et al 2015 the normalized taxonomic abundances were used to linearly combine the precomputed functional profiles in the kegg database the kegg pathway database was used to investigate the nitrogen metabolic pathway in the experimental cws cheng et al 2021b microbial functional genes of the nitrogen metabolism were quantified by qpcr the detailed conditions and primers are described in table s1 zhou et al 2021 the qpcr reactions were performed on the real time pcr system roche lightcycler 480 ii usa all samples were analyzed in triplicate each 20 μl reaction mixture included 10 μl of takara sybr premix ex taq takara bio inc shiga japan 0 2 μm of each primer and 1 μl dna template or no template dna as the negative control 2 5 statistical analysis all data were processed by microsoft office excel 2016 and origin 2018 pearson correlation analysis was carried out by using r software the structural equation model was constructed using amos version 21 as described in text s1 chen et al 2020a analysis of variance within and between groups anova was performed with ibm spss statistics 24 0 software 3 results and discussion 3 1 chemical characteristic changes of mn sand and quartz sand 3 1 1 characteristics of quartz sand before and after mn loaded the surface appearance and chemical composition of quartz sand before and after loading birnessite were obtained from elemental mapping by sem eds fig 1 and table s2 compared with the original quartz sand fig 1a the formed nanosphere fig 1b which is in agreement with the earlier reported synthesis of birnessite type mno2 nanosphere indicated loading of birnessite on the sand ming et al 2012 the diameter of the nanosphere was in the range of 200 500 nm at a magnification of 100 k the cotton ball like particles seem to associate together to create a larger cluster matching a previous observation of octahedral layer structure cheney et al 2008 compared with quartz sand the mn content was significantly increased reaching 12 9 according to elemental mapping of mn sand fig 1d though the oxygen o content on the surface of mn sand 36 7 was slightly lower than that of quartz sand 41 3 the o elements were distributed throughout the surface of the mn sand this is supported by the elemental analysis of a specific mn sand nanosphere the molar ratio of o mn was 2 table s2 the ftir spectra of quartz sand and mn sand further confirmed the loading of birnessite fig s2 a strong absorption peak at around 520 cm 1 was observed in the mn sand sample attributed to vibrations of the octahedral structure jiang et al 2013 moreover the peak at about 773 cm 1 is assigned to the mn o mn bond cheng et al 2021d an absorption band revealing the mn o h bond peak is recognized at ca 1060 cm 1 seredych and bandosz 2012 3 1 2 characteristics of mn sand before and after cws operation to explore the structural difference between cws at the end of the study samples from the middle layer were extracted for sem eds analysis fig 1e g mn sand fig 1e f was significantly different from the quartz sand fig 1g at the end of the study concerning the mn sand in hmn cw the octahedral particles seem to associate together to create a larger cluster cover on the surface as for the mn sand from lmn cw several fluffy coralloid small balls were observed on the surface with a diameter of 1 5 μm at a larger magnification 100 k a fluffy layer structure combined with coralloid structure was observed due to biologically and physicochemically formed layered clusters within the coral or sponge structure bruins et al 2015 showed the diverse structures of biologically and physicochemically formed birnessite biologically formed birnessite had a feathery plate outlook while physicochemically formed birnessite had coral or sponge like structure the surface appearance enables birnessite to be easily involved in oxidation reduction processes in soil and groundwater post 1999 as illustrated in fig s2 c and d peaks around 2400 cm 1 were observed in cws filled with mn sand they could be assigned to reactions between mn sand and ammonium as groups of secondary and tertiary amines absorb in the region 2250 2700 cm 1 yadav 2005 in summary quartz sand loaded with birnessite favored interaction with ammonium 3 2 nitrogen removal and manganese oxide transformation 3 2 1 long term performance of cws to investigate the potential association between manganese oxide reduction and nh4 oxidation influent and effluent nh4 n concentration was frequently measured fig 2 a the whole experimental period was divided into four phases inoculation incubation hrt of 7d hrt of 5 d and hrt of 3 d the initial 48 d was regarded as an inoculation incubation period in which a low extent of nh4 n removal 50 was observed in all three cws the following three periods exhibited a higher extent of nh4 n removal in the hmn cw with an extent of 69 3 on the 7th day the mean extent of nh4 n removal of hmn cw 68 1 was higher than that of lmn cw 56 8 and c cw 59 3 then the hrt was lowered to 5 d after 4 cycles the extent of nh4 n removal of hmn cw reached 76 1 on the 5th day which was higher than that of lmn cw 73 4 and c cw 67 2 finally the hrt was lowered to 3 d the effluent nh4 n in hmn cw 1 90 mg l was lower than that in lmn cw 2 22 mg l and c cw 2 52 mg l in general nh4 n removal followed the order of hmn cw lmn cw c cw all three cws achieved relative high extent of cod removal 98 5 fig s3 and text s2 the nh4 n removal was mainly the result of anoxic biologically mediated nh4 oxidation in the presence of mnox chen et al 2020b nitrate no3 nitrite no2 and nitrogen gas n2 are products as shown in eqs 1 3 below in a previous study although enhanced denitrification and anoxic nitrification were observed in mn ore cws interactions of mnox and nh4 were obscure due to influent containing no3 which was also an intermediate product yang et al 2019c hence it is necessary to further investigate the transformation of nh4 n over time along the cw height in a typical cycle 1 4 mn o 2 n h 4 6 h 4 m n 2 n o 3 5 h 2 o 2 3 mn o 2 n h 4 4 h 3 m n 2 n o 2 4 h 2 o 3 3 mn o 2 2 n h 4 4 h 3 m n 2 n 2 6 h 2 o 3 2 2 changes of nitrogen compounds over time the nitrogen species in cws were analyzed during a typical cycle fig 3 for all systems the effluent nh4 n concentration steadily decreased over time fig 3a the removal extent was higher than 60 on day 3 compared to lmn cw and c cw the effluent nh4 n concentration of the hmn cw sharply decreased after 12 h the rate of nh4 n decrease in the lmn cw and c cw was comparatively moderate with an extent removal of 60 65 on day 3 accumulation and elimination of no3 n and no2 n are shown in fig 3b the effluent no3 n in all microcosms sharply decreased to less than 0 5 mg l finally reaching 0 1 mg l on day 3 notably no2 n accumulated between 24 and 36 h in the hmn cw while accumulated at 12 h in both lmn cw and c cw moreover the no2 n concentration in hmn cw 2 17 mg l and lmn cw 1 99 mg l was higher than that of c cw 0 75 mg l no2 was attributed as an intermediate of mn sand mediated nh4 oxidation wang et al 2021 this is also the reason for the higher extent of nh4 n removal in hmn cw as an intermediate of denitrification the n2o emission flux was measured fig 3c in general the higher n2o emission flux was obtained at 36 to 48 h c cw had the highest mean emission flux of 975 μg m2 h in a typical cycle thus mn sand decreased n2o emissions the highest emission flux was 354 and 629 μg m2 h in hmn cw and lmn cw respectively the mean emission flux of n2o in c cw was 416 μg m2 h which was higher than that of hmn cw 148 μg m2 h and lmn cw 186 μg m2 h n2o is not a product of mnox mediated nitrification or denitrification xu et al 2021a but it is an intermediate of microbial denitrification under hypoxia besides mn has been reported to promote anammox in a biofilter indicating elimination of n2o yang et al 2019a therefore the n2o emission flux results are attributed to promoted anoxic nitrification denitrification and anammox by mn sand layer in cws swathi et al 2017 xie et al 2018 according to n mass balance calculations shown in fig s4 mnox enhanced nh4 n removal the increasing accumulation of no2 n in 12 36 h of one typical cycle indicated the enhanced pathway of mnox mediated nh4 oxidation as shown in eq 2 the accumulation of no2 n in hmn cw was delayed to 24 36 h compared with other cws the low n2o emission implies enhanced denitrification and or anammox in hmn cws 3 2 3 diversity of nitrogen compounds along the cw height to further explore the nh4 n transformation nitrogen compounds along the cw height were measured in this study fig 2c the nh4 n concentration decreased from top to down at 0 5 h for all cws whereas the rate was different a higher reduction rate was observed in the lower 20 cm in hmn cw as opposed to the upper 30 cm in lmn cw and c cw the difference is attributed to filling with mn sand in the 10 30 cm layer from the bottom an increasing no3 n and no2 n concentration was observed at the height of 20 cm in hmn cw compared with lmn cw and c cw mn sand in hmn cw delayed the oxidation of nh4 and the production of no3 and no2 at 72 h neither no3 n nor no2 n was detected less than 0 1 mg l the nh4 n concentration along the cw height showed no significant difference the do orp and ph values along the cw height were measured fig s5 the do was 0 21 1 93 mg l below the height of 40 cm indicating anoxic conditions in the cws the surface do of the substrate was relative higher 1 12 3 08 mg l which was attributed to atmospheric o2 and or oxygenation by plant roots wang et al 2018 besides all monitored orp values were negative 79 7 29 3 mv indicating anoxic conditions the ph values did not vary significantly between the three cws ph values between 7 39 and 8 34 was reported to benefit manganese oxidizing bacteria hou et al 2020 zhao et al 2018 3 2 4 contribution of nitrogen compounds to mn transformation the mn2 concentration along the cw height and time is shown in figs 2b and 3b respectively the mn2 concentration was in the range of 0 2 to 1 0 mg l in hmn cw and lmn cw regarding lmn cw the mn2 concentration increased continuously from 0 14 to 0 90 mg l in one typical cycle whereas the mn2 concentration of mn cw declined from 0 56 to 0 26 mg l and then increased to 1 00 mg l interestingly the mean mn2 concentration was comparable in the two cws at ca 0 6 mg l generally the mn2 concentrations were higher than other reported concentrations of less than 0 098 mg l in vertical up flow cws with mnox xie et al 2018 in this previous research mn2 mediated denitrification occurred and mn2 was re oxidized desireddy and pothanamkandathil chacko 2021 besides biogenic mn oxides were proposed as the oxidation state of mn xie et al 2018 in our study lack of no3 limited mn2 re oxidation this phenomenon in turn indicates the feasibility of mnox for the simultaneous removal of nh4 n and no3 n the mn2 concentrations along the cw height at 0 5 and 72 h are shown in fig 2b in general the mean mn2 concentration at 0 5 h 0 1 mg l was lower than that at 72 h 0 45 mg l besides the mn2 concentration was extremely low at 0 02 mg l at the height of 50 cm regarding hmn cws the highest mn2 concentration of 0 71 to 0 76 mg l was observed at the height of 10 30 cm the mn2 concentration at the height of 10 30 cm of lmn cw was in the range of 0 43 to 0 63 mg l according to liu et al 2020 although the highest mn ii concentration was 35 42 mg l in the substrate of an mn rich cw the mn ii concentration in the outflow was only 1 45 mg l most mn ii was considered to be retained in the reactor due to cycling between mn iv and mn ii liu et al 2020 compared to mn ore the gravel layer seemed to perform poorly in terms of manganese removal in constructed wetlands xu et al 2009 we used a structural equation model analysis to further understand the shift of mn2 in cws in response to nitrogen transformation fig 2d the effect value of x2 df was less than 2 p was higher than 0 05 both gfi and cfi were close to 1 and rmsea was less than 0 08 indicating the excellent fit of the structural equation model text s1 according to the standardized coefficients nh4 n and no2 n were negatively correlated with mn2 concentration while n2o was positively correlated with mn2 concentration the coefficient between nh4 n and mn2 was the largest 0 82 indicating a significant and strong correlation 3 3 microbial community 3 3 1 changes of microbial community structure illumina sequencing was employed to distinguish and explore the diversity of bacterial community in cw systems as illustrated in fig 4 a proteobacteria 32 53 was the dominant phylum for all samples the highest relative abundance of proteobacteria was observed in the middle layer of hmn cw proteobacteria was identified as the most common phylum associated with nitrogen removal in sediments feng et al 2021 at the genus level zoogloea with a relative abundance of 13 6 was the highest in the middle layer of hmn cw fig 4b bai et al 2021 found zoogloea was always dominant and coincidental to no3 n and mn ii removal zoogloea is associated with denitrification and mn ii oxidation chang et al 2021 in our study the middle layer was filled with the mn sand which facilitated the enrichment of zoogloea the relative abundance of zoogloea in the middle layer of lmn cw was only 0 4 which is in accordance with that the abundance of zoogloea is negatively correlated with the amount of n2o produced xu et al 2021b thauera 1 9 6 8 was another genus at a relative high abundance in all samples thauera is a facultative denitrifying bacterium which could grow well and enriched under anaerobic conditions yang et al 2019b thauera was associated with nitrate reduction and nitrite accumulation hu et al 2021 the relative abundance of thauera also increased in vertical subsurface flow cws using minerals as substrate cheng et al 2021c notably the relative abundance of the genus tm7a was higher in hmn cw 6 0 and lmn cw 5 8 than in c cw 3 6 liu et al 2021 found tm7a in soils contaminated with heavy metals indicating that mn sand resulted in a higher abundance of tm7a moreover tm7a was involved in interactions of the carbon and nitrogen cycle rong et al 2021 remarkably the relative abundance of psychrobacter was higher in hmn cw especially in the mn layer 8 4 psychrobacter is an ammonium assimilating bacterium which is generally found in marine environments zhang et al 2021 thus the higher relative abundance of psychrobacter associated with mnox may indicate participation in nh4 n removal acinetobacter is a mn ii oxidizing bacterium found in a biofiltration system treating mn ii rich groundwater dangeti et al 2020 the relative abundance of acinetobacter was high in lmn cw 8 4 compared with mn coated quartz sand the mixture of mn sand and quartz sand may have facilitated the enrichment of acinetobacter su et al 2016 have confirmed the existence of no3 reduction and mn2 oxidation in a moving bed biofilm reactor with immobilized acinetobacter sp sz28 on plastic carrier media treating synthetic wastewater 3 3 2 quantification of nitrogen metabolism functional genes the abundance of 16s rrna total bacteria varied within 10 11 orders of magnitude and showed no significant difference between the three cws fig 5 the abundance of ammonia monooxygenase aob of the samples in the middle layer of hmn cw was significantly higher than that of lmn cw and c cw p 0 05 this result is in agreement with a previous study zhang et al 2019 which proposed nitrification related microorganisms also play a certain role in mn cws in addition to matrix adsorption the abundance of ammonia monooxygenase of archaea aoa in the middle layer of c cw was the highest nitrite oxidoreductase nxrb showed a relative high abundance especially at the middle and lower layers 3 21 1010 9 54 1010 copies g dry weight but showed no significant difference between the three cws p 0 05 as for the nitrate nitrite nitrous oxide reductase narg nirks nosz the abundance at the upper layer was significantly lower in hmn cw and lmn cw while the abundance in the three layers of c cw showed no significant difference 3 3 3 functional annotation faprotax and tax4fun were used to predict functions of the identified microorganisms generally cws containing mn sand were clustered into one group as illustrated in fig s6 the three layers in the hmn cw were far away from each other the mn sand layer increased nitrate reduction and respiration as well as nitrogen respiration moreover denitrification was enhanced in the hmn cw which is consistent with the above discussed nitrogen removal results as for the lmn cw manganese oxidation was enhanced in the upper layer which may be ascribed to higher mn2 concentration at the height of 40 cm as shown in figs 6 and s7 the abundance of functional genes and enzymes were classified and quantified based on the kegg database the abundance of nitrification genes amoabc and hao in the mn sand layer of hmn cw was much higher than in other samples indicating enhanced ammonium removal our results agree with those of previous reports yang et al 2019c but according to reports on feox mediated ammonium removal process ammonia monooxygenase genes were inhibited under feox amendment shuai and jaffe 2019 moreover the abundance of the denitrification gene narg 0 63 was higher than in other samples less than 0 55 the above results are consistent with the faprotax results in which an enhanced denitrification activity was found in hmn cw these results provide useful information to explain the higher nitrogen removal by the hmn cw relative to the lmn cw and c cw 3 4 potential mechanisms of mnox mediated ammonium removal 3 4 1 relationships between mn2 nitrogen compounds and microorganisms the relationships between nitrogen manganese ion and microorganisms were evaluated and indexes are shown in fig 4c and s8 there is a highly significant positive correlation between nh4 n and n2o emission p 0 01 besides the nh4 n concentration showed a significantly negative correlation with mn2 p 0 05 no2 n and orp showed a positive correlation p 0 05 whereas the correlation between no2 n and do was not significant fig s8 this result is consistent with previous reports which proposed enhanced anoxic nitrification by mnox swathi et al 2017 n2o emission was negatively correlated with the genus tm7a p 0 01 confirming the above stated conjecture that mn2 could not effectively be re oxidized by manganese oxidizing bacteria in this study notably zoogloea and psychrobacter showed a positive correlation p 0 05 indicating coexistence and participation in nitrogen metabolism psychrobacter was related to ammonium assimilation zhang et al 2021 while zoogloea was involved in mn2 mediated denitrification chang et al 2021 coexistence and high tolerance to salt concentrations of zoogloea and psychrobacter have been reported in an aerobic granular sludge system wang et al 2017 thauera is positively correlated with n2o emission which is consistent with a previous report cheng et al 2021c 3 4 2 potential metabolism mechanisms the enzymes related to ammonium metabolic processes according to the kegg database were quantified and shown in fig 7 notably the transformation of nh4 to hydroxylamine nh2oh and then to no2 was enhanced in hmn cw this transformation is different from feammox in which ammonia monooxygenase was inhibited in incubations amended with c2h2 huang and jaffé 2015 these researchers ascribed feox mediated ammonia oxidation as a unique pathway in which the acidimicrobiaceae family played a key role besides we observed enhanced denitrification mediated by mn2 this observation is in accordance with that of xie et al 2018 who proposed mn cycle in cws our results complement particular metabolic processes mediated by mnox in nitrogen transformation 4 conclusions in this study birnessite coated quartz sand mn sand was prepared and used as the substrate in cws cws filled with high content of mn sand achieved a higher extent of ammonium removal ammonium removal and n2o emission was closely related to the mn2 concentration ammonia monooxygenase genes amoabc hao were promoted in mnox mediated ammonium oxidation while nitrate reductase narg was enhanced in the mn2 mediated denitrification process the relative abundance of zooloea and psychrobacter was very high in hmn cw playing a key role in ammonium removal and denitrification credit

16163,the adhesion of surfactant molecules on the microplastics surface is affected by the surface structure of the microplastics little is known about the mobility of different microplastics in the medium under surfactants in order to reveal the migration of different microplastics under the action of surfactants the study selected five kinds of microplastics polyethylene pe polypropylene pp polystyrene ps polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe polymethyl methacrylate pmma and two kinds of surfactants cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ctab and sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate sdbs as the research objects the column experiment was used to explore the transport behavior of microplastics under different concentrations of surfactants and the convection dispersion model was used to simulate the dynamic contact angle of the surfactant solution on the microplastics was measured and the adhesion work was calculated by the young dupre equation to reveal the underlying mechanism of microplastics retention in the presence of surfactants the results showed that the transport ability of microplastics followed the order of ptfe pmma ps pe pp and the mobility under high concentrations of surfactants was greater than that at low concentrations which was mainly attributed to the difference in the adhesion of the surfactant on the surface of the microplastics which lead to differences in the migration between the microplastics when the microplastics were close to each other if the reaction force of the electrostatic force was greater than the adhesion force of the surfactant molecules on the surface the surfactant molecules would be separated from the microplastics and the stability of the microplastics would decrease in addition the migration ability of microplastics in anionic surfactants was weaker than that of cationic surfactants because the osmotic and elastic repulsion produced by sdbs were weaker than ctab the research results were of great significance for understanding the environmental behavior of microplastics affected by surfactants and objectively evaluating the transport and fate behavior of microplastics surfactants in the environment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keyword microplastics surfactant transport adhesion 1 introduction recently new pollutants microplastics have attracted more and more attention however microplastics often have low mobility in the subsurface due to the extremely strong hydrophobicity of microplastics current research mostly focuses on exploring the effects of the aging process of microplastics on themselves and environmental pollutants lang et al 2020 ren et al 2021 zhou et al 2021 surfactants are an important class of organic compounds which have been used directly or indirectly in the production of all man made objects that we come into contact with in our daily lives szymczyk et al 2014b therefore lakes rivers soils and other environments are flooded with a large amount of waste water containing surfactants when surfactant molecules exist in the environment the surfactant can be adsorbed on the surface of the microplastic by van der waals force and the hydrophobic force between the hydrophobic tail of the surfactant and the non polar structure of the microplastic surface then the hydrophilic part is exposed to the environment resulting in a decrease in the hydrophobicity of the microplastic surface xia et al 2020 this means that the combination of microplastics and surfactants can make microplastics migrate to the underground environment with water flow which greatly increases the mobility of microplastics in the environment some studies have stated that surfactants promote the migration of nanoparticles in porous media such as nanotubes lu et al 2013 graphene liu et al 2015 and titanium dioxide godinez and darnault 2011 previous studies have also shown that surfactants reduce the hydrophobicity of the surface of polyethylene and polypropylene microplastics thereby weakening the adsorption of microplastics in porous media and enhancing the migration of microplastics hedberg et al 2012 jiang et al 2021 wang et al 2014 however existing research has not explored whether the adhesion between surfactant molecules and the surface of different microplastics affects the migration of microplastics microplastics have different hydrophobic properties on the surface due to different polymerized monomers grundke et al 2015 katarzyna et al 2012 for example the single bonds co and och3 in the polymethyl methacrylate pmma surface structure can act as electron donors when they are in contact with water or other liquids with active hydrogen szymczyk et al 2014a therefore the hydrophilic group of the surfactant molecule interacts with the solid surface through the lorentz van der waals force and the hydrophobic group interacts with the solid surface through hydrophobic interaction resulting in the adsorption of the surfactant molecule on the hydrophobic surface of the pmma microplastic at a certain angle instead of an upright state hu et al 2015 miyamae and nozoye 2003 for completely non polar solids the driving force for the hydrophobic groups of surfactant molecules to adsorb on the solid surface is mainly hydrophobic interaction and the hydrophilic group faces the water phase making the solid surface hydrophilic until the solid liquid interface forms a saturated monolayer zdziennicka and jańczuk 2010 zhou et al 2016 therefore the adsorption layer structure and the outermost group formed by surfactant molecules on various solid surfaces are related to the properties of the solid surface the difference in the interaction between different microplastics and surfactant molecules will inevitably affect the adhesion tension of the surfactant on the microplastics and affect the hydrophilicity of the microplastics in solution in this perspective it is interesting to determine the influence of the surface structure between microplastics on migration in porous media however to the best of the authors knowledge there is no research to explore the influence of the surface structure of microplastics on the microplastics transport in the presence of surfactants polyethylene pe polypropylene pp polystyrene ps polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe and polymethyl methacrylate pmma microplastics can be generally detected in the environment because of widely used in daily life and industrial production hu et al 2022 this work mainly takes these five kinds of microplastics with different surface properties as the research objects and explores the migration behavior of microplastics in porous media in the presence of ionic surfactants cationic surfactants cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ctab anionic surfactants sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate sdbs herein the specific objectives are as follows 1 clarify the adhesion of ctab and sdbs surfactants on different microplastics 2 reveal the transport behavior of different microplastics in saturated porous media and 3 clarify the relationship between the area occupied by surfactants at the interface of microplastics and the migration of microplastics 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the polyethylene pe polypropylene pp polystyrene ps polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe and polymethyl methacrylate pmma microplastics used in this study were all purchased from china united plastics co ltd with a particle size of 2 um the microplastics were soaked and cleaned before the experiment both ctab and sdbs were purchased from aladdin reagent co ltd and their molecular weights were 364 g mol 1 and 348 g mol 1 respectively the other chemical reagents in this study were of analytical grade quartz sand with a particle size of 10 20 mesh was purchased from zhouzhi quartz sand factory before the experiment it was cleaned with acid and alkali to remove surface impurities the 300 mg pe pp ps ptfe or pmma microplastic powder was added to 1l sdbs or ctab solution of a certain concentration 100 200 300 500 and 1000 mg l 1 after being stirred for 5 min each microplastic suspension was sonicated for 30 min using an ultrasonic cleaner kq 500de kunshan ultrasonic instrument company china to sonicate for 30 min to ensure uniform suspension the concentration of each microplastic stock solution was 300 mg l 1 the choice of microplastic concentration was based on our previous research to better demonstrate the migration mechanism of different microplastics under the influence of surfactants and their retention behavior in porous media jiang et al 2021 the stability of the microplastic suspension was shown in figure s3 surfactant solution was prepared by using a background electrolyte solution ph 6 5 is 0 001 m kcl the zeta plus analyzer zetasizer nano zs90 malvern instruments uk was used to measure the zeta potential and particle size of microplastics and quartz sand in solutions with different concentrations of surfactants the particle size range of pe pp ps ptfe and pmma microplastic under different conditions is approximately 1 4 2 9 um the dcat21 surface tension meter german dataphysics company was used to measure the surface tension of sdbs and ctab aqueous solutions the experiment adopts the hanging piece method and the temperature was controlled at 25 0 0 2 c the oca20 video optical contact angle measuring instrument dataphysics germany was used to measure the dynamic contact angles of sdbs and ctab aqueous solutions on the surface of pe pp ps ptfe and pmma the results of surface tension and dynamic contact angle were shown in fig s1 and fig s2 respectively 2 2 column experiment in this work an acrylic glass column with a height of 10 cm and an inner diameter of 1 5 cm was used for the column experiment the quartz sand was wet packed using distilled water with a glass stirring rod to minimize layering and to remove air entrapments in the column sun et al 2010 the porosity of the packed column was determined to be 0 34 and the pore volume pv was 6 ml before the column experiment distilled water was used to rinse the sand column until the effluent did not contain any visible impurities afterwards the distilled water was replaced with sdbs or ctab solution to rinse the sand column for 2 h to balance the experimental conditions in the column then 10 pv microplastic solutions 300 mg l 1 ph 6 5 containing different concentrations of surfactants 100 200 300 500 and 1000 mg l 1 were injected into the sand column at 2 0 ml min 1 next the microplastics solution was quickly converted into sdbs or ctab solutions of different concentrations to wash the sand column until the concentration of the microplastics in the effluent was zero in these experiments the microplastic suspensions were injected into the quartz sand column while stirring the effluent from the column was continuously collected in test tubes every 10 ml using an automatic fraction collector bs 16a lcd shanghai huxi analysis instrument factory co ltd china the microplastic concentration was determined by measuring the light attenuation au at a wavelength of 350 nm via turbidimetry yin et al 2010 the light attenuation method based on sample turbidity is listed as a standard method for determining the concentration of suspended particles in natural water body in u s techniques of water resources investigations anderson 2005 the calibration curve was used to quantify the relationship between the concentration of 0 to 350 mg l 1 pe or pp and light attenuation and the r2 value from the standard curve were all greater than 0 999 the absorbance of sdbs and ctab at 350 nm was zero jiang et al 2021 nano3 was used as a tracer to measure the dispersion coefficient of the hydraulic characteristics of the quartz sand column at the same speed all column experiments were performed in parallel in duplicate 2 3 mathematical model the derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo and xdlvo theory was used to explain the transport and deposition behavior of microplastics adsorbing surfactants in porous media under various experimental conditions the xdlvo energy etot was established as the sum of the van der waals attraction evdw electric double layer repulsion eedl osmotic eosm elastic eelas and hydrophobic force ehf christenson and claesson 2001 gregory 1981 hogg et al 1966 vincent et al 1986 other details are provided in supplementary data s1 the advection dispersion equation ade was used to simulate colloids transport in the sand columns jiang et al 2021 the governing equations can be written as follows ding et al 2014 1 c w t d 2 c w z 2 v c w z ρ θ s t 2 ρ θ s t k 1 s s max c w where c w is the colloid concentration in the pore water mg l 1 reflecting the magnitude of the equilibrium reaction in the sand column d is the dispersion coefficient cm2 min 1 v is the flow rate cm min 1 ρ is the medium bulk density g cm 3 θ is the porosity remain unchanged for lab scale columns chandrasekar et al 2021 k is the first order retention coefficient min 1 and s max is the maximum deposited particle concentration this model was applied to simulate the experimental breakthrough curves the parameters k and s max were established using hydrus 1d 2 4 statistical analysis the recovery values of the microplastics were measured using a mass balance meanwhile the energy profile models breakthrough curves and standard deviation values represented by error bars were determined using microsoft excel software version 2019 microsoft corporation usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 the transport of different microplastics in the presence of ctab fig 1 compares the transport of five types of microplastics at different concentrations of ctab the breakthrough curve shows that the migration ability of the microplastics follows the order of ptfe pmma ps pe pp and the high concentration of ctab is greater than the low concentration of ctab as shown in fig s4 in the absence of surfactants the plastic particles are extremely difficult to migrate in the medium because of insoluble in water and float on the surface this means that the surfactant promotes the transport of microplastics in the sand column it is shown in table 1 that the recovery rates of ptfe pmma ps pe and pp microplastics under 100 mg l 1 ctab were 13 78 20 17 33 89 51 57 and 73 10 respectively and the recovery rates under 500 mg l 1 ctab were 31 92 38 19 81 10 93 36 and 99 92 respectively the zeta of the five microplastics at the same ctab concentration follows the order of ptfe pmma ps pe pp table 1 the zeta potential of ptfe pmma ps pe and pp microplastics under 100 mg l 1 ctab were 20 30 22 71 24 56 26 58 and 25 83 mv respectively and the zeta potential under 500 mg l 1 ctab were 31 69 34 31 44 93 46 32 and 51 65 mv respectively the particle size of the five types of microplastics in the solution is also the same it implies that pp microplastics in ctab solution have the greatest electrostatic repulsion and stability compared with other microplastics leading to the strongest migration ability ling et al 2021 interestingly the interaction energy between five microplastics and the surface of quartz sand in the presence of ctab is calculated according to the classic dlvo theory as shown in fig 2 the results suggest that the five kinds of microplastics all have high mobility in quartz sand because the energy barrier values are all far greater than 15 kt this indicates that the retention of the five types of microplastics in porous media will not show a big difference wang et al 2022 this is contradictory to our experimental results because when using the dlvo theory to calculate the interaction force between the particles and the surface of the medium the microplastics and the ctab molecules adsorbed on the surface of the microplastics are considered as a whole to calculate however the surfactant molecules and microplastics adhered by weak interaction force hydrophobic interaction cannot form a tight whole the microplastics do not disperse well in water due to their hydrophobicity once ctab is separated from the microplastics the stability of the microplastics in the solution will drop sharply according to previous studies the adhesion work of surfactants on solid surfaces is mainly related to the polar forces of different solid surfaces szymczyk et al 2014a for example pmma microplastics contain oxygen functional groups which cause the adsorption of surfactant molecules on their hydrophobic surfaces to include both hydrophobic interactions and lorentz van der waals forces hu et al 2015 miyamae and nozoye 2003 the adhesion work of liquid reflects the adhesion capacity between solid and liquid which can be calculated by young dupre equation chaudhuri and paria 2009 the specific details are shown in the supplementary information s2 the adhesion work of 100 mg l 1 ctab on ptfe pmma ps pe and pp is shown in table 1 the adhesion work follows the order of ptfe pmma ps pe pp this is consistent with the experimental results of this work indicating that the difference in the adhesion of surfactants on the microplastics surface leads to differences in the transport between microplastics the author considers that the adhesion tension of ctab on the surface of microplastics is different from the interaction force between microplastics or between microplastics and media the essence is that the strength of the adhesion tension reflects the ability of ctab molecules to detach from the surface of the microplastics szymczyk et al 2014b when the microplastics are close to each other the electrostatic repulsion prevents the two parties from approaching the electrostatic force is generated by the ctab molecules adhered to the surface of the microplastics at the same time because the ctab molecules and the microplastics are not a solid whole if the reaction force of the electrostatic force in the approaching process is greater than the adhesion force of ctab molecules on the surface it will inevitably lead to the ctab molecules to break away from the microplastics which reduces the stability of the microplastics schematic interpretations are shown below shown in fig 3 according to calculation the electrostatic interaction energy of ptfe at 34 nm is already greater than the adhesive work of ptfe on the microplastics surface pmma ps pe and pp exceed the adhesive work at 33 31 28 and 21 nm respectively this study defines this distance as the instability distance it indicates that when the microplastics are close to each other for a certain distance the ctab molecules on the surface will have a tendency to detach and the ctab molecules on the surface of the pp microplastics are the most difficult to detach for microplastics combined with surfactants if the distance between the microplastics is greater than the instability distance the microplastics and ctab can be treated as a charged colloid from this perspective when the distance between microplastics exceeds the instability distance the transport behavior conforms to the dlvo theory for example the higher the absolute value of the zeta potential the higher is the repulsion between the particles and there is a better the mobility he et al 2019 it is well known that the particles have random and disordered brownian motion in the solution and their average kinetic energy is 15 kt chrysikopoulos et al 2017 dong et al 2020 it can be found that the brownian motion of the particle is enough to make it close to each other once the distance is less than the instability distance ctab and microplastics are a binary system and need to be discussed separately as the concentration of ctab in the solution increased to 500 mg l 1 the migration ability of the five types of microplastics in porous media are all improved fig 1 the reason is that ctab does not adhere tightly and upright on the surface of the microplastic at low concentrations tiberg et al 1999 as the concentration increases the ctab molecules on the surface of the microplastic gradually stand close to each other especially the concentration of 500 mg l 1 has exceeded the critical micelle concentration of ctab in solution therefore different concentrations of ctab have different adhesion on the surface of microplastics and generally linear increase with increasing concentration however after the concentration exceeds the critical micelle concentration the adhesion force basically does not change greatly because the adsorption of ctab molecules on the solid surface has reached saturation szymczyk et al 2014b the adhesion work on the plastic surface at a ctab concentration of 500 mg l 1 is shown in table 1 the adhesion work of ctab in ptfe pmma ps pe and pp all increased and its values were 29 67 31 21 66 82 79 44 and 227 90 kt respectively meanwhile the zeta potential increases correspondingly due to the increase of ctab molecules on the surface of the microplastics however it can be found that the magnitude of the increase in the electrostatic force is less than the adhesion tension by calculating the electrostatic force suggesting that the ctab molecules on the surface of the microplastics can withstand greater electrostatic repulsion the electrostatic effect of ptfe pmma ps pe and pp exceeds the adhesion work at 32 29 24 23 and 15 nm respectively and the decrease in instability distance implies that the microplastics and ctab molecules are more stable when viewed as a whole because the closer the distance between microplastics the greater the energy barrier that needs to be overcome looking at it from another perspective the sum of the true radius of the microplastics and the instability distance can be regarded as the stable radius of the microplastics that is the radius range where the stability of the microplastics is affected by each other the greater the instability distance the higher is the probability of contact within the stable radius between the microplastics in addition the zeta potential on the surface of the microplastics increases due to the adhesion of more ctab molecules table 1 which means that the microplastics are more stable due to the increase in electrostatic repulsion beyond the instability distance therefore the transport ability of microplastics is all improved in a solution with a ctab concentration of 500 mg l 1 the breakthrough curve of microplastics in the presence of ctab is fitted using the ade model the results are in good agreement with our experimental data indicating that the transport of microplastics in porous media has colloidal characteristics jiang et al 2021 the best fit values for the fitting parameters i e k and smax and r2 are shown in table 1 the best smax and k values of the microplastics with low ctab concentrations were higher than those of microplastics with high ctab concentrations the change trends of the smax and k values are also consistent with the experimental results 3 2 the transport of different microplastics in the presence of sdbs the breakthrough curves of pe pp ps ptfe and pmma microplastics at different concentrations of sdbs are shown in fig 4 the transport ability of microplastics is similar to that under ctab and also follows the order of ptfe pmma ps pe pp the recovery rates of ptfe pmma ps pe and pp microplastics under 100 mg l 1 sdbs were 7 87 10 66 27 60 31 88 and 38 40 respectively and the recovery rates under 500 mg l 1 sdbs were 13 35 19 85 36 52 48 35 and 58 65 respectively table 1 the zeta potential of ptfe pmma ps pe and pp microplastics under 100 mg l 1 sdbs were 20 55 21 59 22 18 24 12 and 25 94 mv respectively and the zeta potential under 500 mg l 1 sdbs were 27 91 28 22 31 16 34 02 and 35 78 mv respectively it shows that anionic surfactants have similar abilities to cationic surfactants they can be combined with the surface of the microplastics through hydrophobic interaction the hydrophilic end faces outwards to make the surface of the microplastics negatively charged thereby increasing the migration ability of the microplastic in the porous medium jiang et al 2021 by calculating the dlvo interaction energy it is shown in fig 5 that the difference between different microplastics under sdbs is also small which indicates that the migration ability of different microplastics in porous media is also due to the difference in the adhesion of sdbs molecules on the different microplastics surface the calculated adhesion work of sdbs at a concentration of 100 mg l 1 on ptfe pmma ps pe and pp are 8 25 8 54 23 13 31 98 and 48 63 kt respectively table 1 calculating the electrostatic force between microplastics under sdbs based on zeta potential it can be deduced that the instability distances of ptfe pmma ps pe and pp under sdbs are 38 36 30 27 and 24 nm respectively in addition the transport ability of microplastics at high concentrations of sdbs is greater than that at low concentrations whether the surfactant has a positive charge or a negative charge it will cause the same migration sequence for the microplastics that is the migration ability is ptfe pmma ps pe pp the reason for controlling this phenomenon is the adhesion work of the surfactant on the surface of the microplastic the greater the adhesion work the higher is the stability of the microplastic and the stronger its transport in the porous medium it is interesting to note that the identical microplastics have weaker migration ability in anionic surfactants than cationic surfactants for example the recovery rates of pp under 100 mg l 1 and 500 mg l 1 ctab are 73 10 and 99 92 respectively but the recovery rates under sdbs are 38 40 and 58 65 respectively the reason is that the hydrophilic end of the cationic surfactant ctab can be adsorbed on the surface of the quartz sand by electrostatic force and the hydrophobic end faces the water phase the hydrophobic chains of ctab in the solution and the hydrophobic chains on the quartz sand surface form a double layer of ctab molecular coverage on the quartz sand surface by a combination of hydrophobic interaction sun et al 2015 however the anionic surfactant sdbs has the same negative charge as the surface of the quartz sand which generates electrostatic repulsion and cannot be adsorbed on the surface of the quartz sand as shown in table 1 the zeta potential of the quartz sand surface under ctab is positive which confirms that the surface of the quartz sand is covered with a double layer of ctab molecules surfactant as a long chain molecule has osmotic effect and elastic repulsion which leads to the contact of microplastics and quartz sand in ctab solution will be affected by the elastic repulsion and osmotic force of three layers of surfactant molecules li et al 2018 as for sdbs it cannot be attached to the surface of quartz sand due to electrostatic repulsion only the surface of the microplastic has a single layer of sdbs molecules and the elastic repulsion and osmotic force are weaker than ctab on this basis the xdlvo interaction energy between microplastics and quartz sand with elastic repulsion and osmotic force added was calculated in supplementary figure s5 it is shown that the interaction energy between microplastics and quartz sand in the presence of sdbs is much smaller than ctab indicating that microplastics are more stable in ctab and are not easy to deposit on the surface of quartz sand these observations indicate that the osmotic and elastic repulsion generated by ctab is much greater than that of sdbs which makes the transport of microplastics in ctab very strong 3 3 effect of surfactants concentration on the transport of different microplastics in the presence of ctab or sdbs the difference in transport ability of ptfe pmma ps pe and pp depends on the adhesion work of surfactant molecules on the surface of microplastics the migration ability of the microplastics is also improved with the surfactant concentration increasing because the adhesion work of the surfactant on the surface of the microplastics is greater at high concentrations however the results shown in figs 1 4 and s6 show that the migration ability of the microplastics does not change significantly when the surfactant concentration is 300 500 and 1000 mg l 1 therefore the influence of ctab or sdbs concentration changes on the migration of microplastics was further explored the critical micelle concentrations of ctab and sdbs are 327 21 and 481 mg l 1 respectively fig s1 when the surfactant concentration is higher than the critical micelle concentration ctab and sdbs molecules are already close together even if the concentration is increasing it will not affect the amount of surfactant attached to the surface of the microplastics tiberg et al 1999 the maximum adhesion amount of surfactant at the interface is related to the smallest area occupied by surfactant molecules on the interface and this area depends on the surface structure of different microplastics szymczyk et al 2014b for example pmma microplastics have both lorentz van der waals force and hydrophobic interaction force on the surface due to the presence of oxygen functional groups which results in the adsorption of surfactant molecules on the pmma surface at a certain angle instead of an upright state hu et al 2015 miyamae and nozoye 2003 in this case ctab and sdbs molecules occupy a larger area in pmma microplastics which makes the adhesion work of ctab and sdbs at the pmma interface smaller in order to qualitatively understand the relationship between the area occupied by single surfactant molecules asl and the migration ability of the microplastics according to these data in table s2 correlation analysis between area occupied by single surfactant molecules and the recovery rate of different microplastics is performed the specific calculation formula for the area occupied by single surfactant molecules at different concentrations can be found in the supplementary information s2 s3 it clearly shows that there is a significant negative correlation between the occupied area and the migration ability of the microplastics fig 6 with a correlation coefficient r2 0 9 as mentioned above the surfactant occupies a smaller area at the microplastic interface which is more conducive to the formation of a stable surfactant microplastic combination therefore the results show that the area occupied by single ctab or sdbs molecules at the interface leads to different adhesion work formed on the surface of the microplastics which leads to a significant difference in the migration ability of the microplastics in addition the surfactant concentration will affect the area occupied by the single molecule at the interface fig 6 indicates that the slope value of the recovery rate of microplastics and the occupied area usually follows 1000 500 300 200 100 mg l 1 the slope of the recovery rate and the occupied area indicates that the tendency of the migration ability of the microplastics to increase varies with the value of the area occupied by the surfactant in other words the smaller the absolute value of the slope it indicates that the migration capacity of the microplastics increases as the occupied area decreases according to the occupied area value it can be found that the occupied area of single ctab and sdbs molecules at the interface decreases rapidly as the concentration increases the results show that when the surfactant concentration is lower than the critical micelle concentration the enhancement effect of the surfactant on the mobility of the microplastics is related to the surfactant concentration 4 conclusions the presence of surfactants was effective in increasing the migration of microplastics in the presence of ctab or sdbs the transport ability of different microplastics namely ptfe pmma ps pe and pp depended on the adhesion work of surfactant molecules on the microplastics surface when the microplastics were close to each other the electrostatic repulsion prevents the two parties from approaching if the reaction force of the electrostatic force in the approaching process was greater than the adhesion force of ctab molecules on the surface it would inevitably lead to the ctab molecules to break away from the microplastics which reduced the stability of the microplastics the adhesion tension of ctab or sdbs on ptfe pmma ps pe and pp was ptfe pmma ps pe pp and the adhesion work of surfactant molecules on ptfe and pmma was much smaller than that of pp and pe this phenomenon was consistent with the transport behavior of microplastics in this study the adhesion work of the surfactant at the interface was related to the smallest area occupied by the single surfactant molecule on the interface correlation analysis between the area and the recovery rate of different microplastics showed that the smaller the area occupied by the single surfactant molecules at the microplastic interface the better it was to form a stable surfactant microplastic combination and improve the migration ability of the microplastic in addition since the osmotic and elastic repulsion generated by ctab were much greater than that of sdbs the migration ability of microplastics in sdbs was weaker than that of ctab therefore the migration of microplastics in groundwater contaminated by surfactants must be carefully

16163,the adhesion of surfactant molecules on the microplastics surface is affected by the surface structure of the microplastics little is known about the mobility of different microplastics in the medium under surfactants in order to reveal the migration of different microplastics under the action of surfactants the study selected five kinds of microplastics polyethylene pe polypropylene pp polystyrene ps polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe polymethyl methacrylate pmma and two kinds of surfactants cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ctab and sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate sdbs as the research objects the column experiment was used to explore the transport behavior of microplastics under different concentrations of surfactants and the convection dispersion model was used to simulate the dynamic contact angle of the surfactant solution on the microplastics was measured and the adhesion work was calculated by the young dupre equation to reveal the underlying mechanism of microplastics retention in the presence of surfactants the results showed that the transport ability of microplastics followed the order of ptfe pmma ps pe pp and the mobility under high concentrations of surfactants was greater than that at low concentrations which was mainly attributed to the difference in the adhesion of the surfactant on the surface of the microplastics which lead to differences in the migration between the microplastics when the microplastics were close to each other if the reaction force of the electrostatic force was greater than the adhesion force of the surfactant molecules on the surface the surfactant molecules would be separated from the microplastics and the stability of the microplastics would decrease in addition the migration ability of microplastics in anionic surfactants was weaker than that of cationic surfactants because the osmotic and elastic repulsion produced by sdbs were weaker than ctab the research results were of great significance for understanding the environmental behavior of microplastics affected by surfactants and objectively evaluating the transport and fate behavior of microplastics surfactants in the environment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keyword microplastics surfactant transport adhesion 1 introduction recently new pollutants microplastics have attracted more and more attention however microplastics often have low mobility in the subsurface due to the extremely strong hydrophobicity of microplastics current research mostly focuses on exploring the effects of the aging process of microplastics on themselves and environmental pollutants lang et al 2020 ren et al 2021 zhou et al 2021 surfactants are an important class of organic compounds which have been used directly or indirectly in the production of all man made objects that we come into contact with in our daily lives szymczyk et al 2014b therefore lakes rivers soils and other environments are flooded with a large amount of waste water containing surfactants when surfactant molecules exist in the environment the surfactant can be adsorbed on the surface of the microplastic by van der waals force and the hydrophobic force between the hydrophobic tail of the surfactant and the non polar structure of the microplastic surface then the hydrophilic part is exposed to the environment resulting in a decrease in the hydrophobicity of the microplastic surface xia et al 2020 this means that the combination of microplastics and surfactants can make microplastics migrate to the underground environment with water flow which greatly increases the mobility of microplastics in the environment some studies have stated that surfactants promote the migration of nanoparticles in porous media such as nanotubes lu et al 2013 graphene liu et al 2015 and titanium dioxide godinez and darnault 2011 previous studies have also shown that surfactants reduce the hydrophobicity of the surface of polyethylene and polypropylene microplastics thereby weakening the adsorption of microplastics in porous media and enhancing the migration of microplastics hedberg et al 2012 jiang et al 2021 wang et al 2014 however existing research has not explored whether the adhesion between surfactant molecules and the surface of different microplastics affects the migration of microplastics microplastics have different hydrophobic properties on the surface due to different polymerized monomers grundke et al 2015 katarzyna et al 2012 for example the single bonds co and och3 in the polymethyl methacrylate pmma surface structure can act as electron donors when they are in contact with water or other liquids with active hydrogen szymczyk et al 2014a therefore the hydrophilic group of the surfactant molecule interacts with the solid surface through the lorentz van der waals force and the hydrophobic group interacts with the solid surface through hydrophobic interaction resulting in the adsorption of the surfactant molecule on the hydrophobic surface of the pmma microplastic at a certain angle instead of an upright state hu et al 2015 miyamae and nozoye 2003 for completely non polar solids the driving force for the hydrophobic groups of surfactant molecules to adsorb on the solid surface is mainly hydrophobic interaction and the hydrophilic group faces the water phase making the solid surface hydrophilic until the solid liquid interface forms a saturated monolayer zdziennicka and jańczuk 2010 zhou et al 2016 therefore the adsorption layer structure and the outermost group formed by surfactant molecules on various solid surfaces are related to the properties of the solid surface the difference in the interaction between different microplastics and surfactant molecules will inevitably affect the adhesion tension of the surfactant on the microplastics and affect the hydrophilicity of the microplastics in solution in this perspective it is interesting to determine the influence of the surface structure between microplastics on migration in porous media however to the best of the authors knowledge there is no research to explore the influence of the surface structure of microplastics on the microplastics transport in the presence of surfactants polyethylene pe polypropylene pp polystyrene ps polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe and polymethyl methacrylate pmma microplastics can be generally detected in the environment because of widely used in daily life and industrial production hu et al 2022 this work mainly takes these five kinds of microplastics with different surface properties as the research objects and explores the migration behavior of microplastics in porous media in the presence of ionic surfactants cationic surfactants cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ctab anionic surfactants sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate sdbs herein the specific objectives are as follows 1 clarify the adhesion of ctab and sdbs surfactants on different microplastics 2 reveal the transport behavior of different microplastics in saturated porous media and 3 clarify the relationship between the area occupied by surfactants at the interface of microplastics and the migration of microplastics 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the polyethylene pe polypropylene pp polystyrene ps polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe and polymethyl methacrylate pmma microplastics used in this study were all purchased from china united plastics co ltd with a particle size of 2 um the microplastics were soaked and cleaned before the experiment both ctab and sdbs were purchased from aladdin reagent co ltd and their molecular weights were 364 g mol 1 and 348 g mol 1 respectively the other chemical reagents in this study were of analytical grade quartz sand with a particle size of 10 20 mesh was purchased from zhouzhi quartz sand factory before the experiment it was cleaned with acid and alkali to remove surface impurities the 300 mg pe pp ps ptfe or pmma microplastic powder was added to 1l sdbs or ctab solution of a certain concentration 100 200 300 500 and 1000 mg l 1 after being stirred for 5 min each microplastic suspension was sonicated for 30 min using an ultrasonic cleaner kq 500de kunshan ultrasonic instrument company china to sonicate for 30 min to ensure uniform suspension the concentration of each microplastic stock solution was 300 mg l 1 the choice of microplastic concentration was based on our previous research to better demonstrate the migration mechanism of different microplastics under the influence of surfactants and their retention behavior in porous media jiang et al 2021 the stability of the microplastic suspension was shown in figure s3 surfactant solution was prepared by using a background electrolyte solution ph 6 5 is 0 001 m kcl the zeta plus analyzer zetasizer nano zs90 malvern instruments uk was used to measure the zeta potential and particle size of microplastics and quartz sand in solutions with different concentrations of surfactants the particle size range of pe pp ps ptfe and pmma microplastic under different conditions is approximately 1 4 2 9 um the dcat21 surface tension meter german dataphysics company was used to measure the surface tension of sdbs and ctab aqueous solutions the experiment adopts the hanging piece method and the temperature was controlled at 25 0 0 2 c the oca20 video optical contact angle measuring instrument dataphysics germany was used to measure the dynamic contact angles of sdbs and ctab aqueous solutions on the surface of pe pp ps ptfe and pmma the results of surface tension and dynamic contact angle were shown in fig s1 and fig s2 respectively 2 2 column experiment in this work an acrylic glass column with a height of 10 cm and an inner diameter of 1 5 cm was used for the column experiment the quartz sand was wet packed using distilled water with a glass stirring rod to minimize layering and to remove air entrapments in the column sun et al 2010 the porosity of the packed column was determined to be 0 34 and the pore volume pv was 6 ml before the column experiment distilled water was used to rinse the sand column until the effluent did not contain any visible impurities afterwards the distilled water was replaced with sdbs or ctab solution to rinse the sand column for 2 h to balance the experimental conditions in the column then 10 pv microplastic solutions 300 mg l 1 ph 6 5 containing different concentrations of surfactants 100 200 300 500 and 1000 mg l 1 were injected into the sand column at 2 0 ml min 1 next the microplastics solution was quickly converted into sdbs or ctab solutions of different concentrations to wash the sand column until the concentration of the microplastics in the effluent was zero in these experiments the microplastic suspensions were injected into the quartz sand column while stirring the effluent from the column was continuously collected in test tubes every 10 ml using an automatic fraction collector bs 16a lcd shanghai huxi analysis instrument factory co ltd china the microplastic concentration was determined by measuring the light attenuation au at a wavelength of 350 nm via turbidimetry yin et al 2010 the light attenuation method based on sample turbidity is listed as a standard method for determining the concentration of suspended particles in natural water body in u s techniques of water resources investigations anderson 2005 the calibration curve was used to quantify the relationship between the concentration of 0 to 350 mg l 1 pe or pp and light attenuation and the r2 value from the standard curve were all greater than 0 999 the absorbance of sdbs and ctab at 350 nm was zero jiang et al 2021 nano3 was used as a tracer to measure the dispersion coefficient of the hydraulic characteristics of the quartz sand column at the same speed all column experiments were performed in parallel in duplicate 2 3 mathematical model the derjaguin landau verwey overbeek

al 1966 vincent et al 1986 other details are provided in supplementary data s1 the advection dispersion equation ade was used to simulate colloids transport in the sand columns jiang et al 2021 the governing equations can be written as follows ding et al 2014 1 c w t d 2 c w z 2 v c w z ρ θ s t 2 ρ θ s t k 1 s s max c w where c w is the colloid concentration in the pore water mg l 1 reflecting

the experimental breakthrough curves the parameters k and s max were established using hydrus 1d 2 4 statistical analysis the recovery values of the microplastics were measured using a mass balance meanwhile the energy profile models breakthrough curves and standard deviation values represented by error bars were determined using microsoft excel software version 2019 microsoft corporation usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 the transport of different microplastics in the presence of ctab fig 1 compares the transport of five types of microplastics at different concentrations of ctab the breakthrough curve shows that the migration ability of the microplastics follows the order of ptfe pmma ps pe pp and the high concentration of ctab is greater than the low concentration of ctab as shown in fig s4 in the absence of surfactants the plastic particles are extremely difficult to migrate in the medium because of insoluble in water and float on the surface this means that the surfactant promotes the transport of microplastics in the sand column it is shown in table 1 that the recovery rates of ptfe pmma ps pe and pp microplastics under 100 mg l 1 ctab were 13 78 20 17 33 89 51 57 and 73 10 respectively and the recovery rates under 500 mg l 1 ctab were 31 92 38 19 81 10 93 36 and 99 92 respectively the zeta of the five microplastics at the same ctab concentration follows the order of ptfe pmma ps pe pp table 1 the zeta potential of ptfe pmma ps pe and pp microplastics under 100 mg l 1 ctab were 20 30 22 71 24 56 26 58 and 25 83 mv respectively and the zeta potential under 500 mg l 1 ctab were 31 69 34 31 44 93 46 32 and 51 65 mv respectively the particle size of the five types of microplastics in the solution is also the same it implies that pp microplastics in ctab solution have the greatest electrostatic repulsion and stability compared with other microplastics leading to the strongest migration ability ling et al 2021 interestingly the interaction energy between five microplastics and the surface of quartz sand in the presence of ctab is calculated according to the classic dlvo theory as shown in fig 2 the results suggest that the five kinds of microplastics all have high mobility in quartz sand because the energy barrier values are all far greater than 15 kt this indicates that the retention of the five types of microplastics in porous media will not show a big difference wang et al 2022 this is contradictory to our experimental results because when using the dlvo theory to calculate the interaction force between the particles and the surface of the medium the microplastics and the ctab molecules adsorbed on the surface of the microplastics are considered as a whole to calculate however the surfactant molecules and microplastics adhered by weak interaction force hydrophobic interaction cannot form a tight whole the microplastics do not disperse well in water due to their hydrophobicity once ctab is separated from the microplastics the stability of the microplastics in the solution will drop sharply according to previous studies the adhesion work of surfactants on solid surfaces is mainly related to the polar forces of different solid surfaces szymczyk et al 2014a for example pmma microplastics contain oxygen functional groups which cause the adsorption of surfactant molecules on their hydrophobic surfaces to include both hydrophobic interactions and lorentz van der waals forces hu et al 2015 miyamae and nozoye 2003 the adhesion work of liquid reflects the adhesion capacity between solid and liquid which can be calculated by young dupre equation chaudhuri and paria 2009 the specific details are shown in the supplementary information s2 the adhesion work of 100 mg l 1 ctab on ptfe pmma ps pe and pp is shown in table 1 the adhesion work follows the order of ptfe pmma ps pe pp this is consistent with the experimental results of this work indicating that the difference in the adhesion of surfactants on the microplastics surface leads to differences in the transport between microplastics the author considers that the adhesion tension of ctab on the surface of microplastics is different from the interaction force between microplastics or between microplastics and media the essence is that the strength of the adhesion tension reflects the ability of ctab molecules to detach from the surface of the microplastics szymczyk et al 2014b when the microplastics are close to each other the electrostatic repulsion prevents the two parties from approaching the electrostatic force is generated by the ctab molecules adhered to the surface of the microplastics at the same time because the ctab molecules and the microplastics are not a solid whole if the reaction force of the electrostatic force in the approaching process is greater than the adhesion force of ctab molecules on the surface it will inevitably lead to the ctab molecules to break away from the microplastics which reduces the stability of the microplastics schematic interpretations are shown below shown in fig 3 according to calculation the electrostatic interaction energy of ptfe at 34 nm is already greater than the adhesive work of ptfe on the microplastics surface pmma ps pe and pp exceed the adhesive work at 33 31 28 and 21 nm respectively this study defines this distance as the instability distance it indicates that when the microplastics are close to each other for a certain distance the ctab molecules on the surface will have a tendency to detach and the ctab molecules on the surface of the pp microplastics are the most difficult to detach for microplastics combined with surfactants if the distance between the microplastics is greater than the instability distance the microplastics and ctab can be treated as a charged colloid from this perspective when the distance between microplastics exceeds the instability distance the transport behavior conforms to the dlvo theory for example the higher the absolute value of the zeta potential the higher is the repulsion between the particles and there is a better the mobility he et al 2019 it is well known that the particles have random and disordered brownian motion in the solution and their average kinetic energy is 15 kt chrysikopoulos et al 2017 dong et al 2020 it can be found that the brownian motion of the particle is enough to make it close to each other once the distance is less than the instability distance ctab and microplastics are a binary system and need to be discussed separately as the concentration of ctab in the solution increased to 500 mg l 1 the migration ability of the five types of microplastics in porous media are all improved fig 1 the reason is that ctab does not adhere tightly and upright on the surface of the microplastic at low concentrations tiberg et al 1999 as the concentration increases the ctab molecules on the surface of the microplastic gradually stand close to each other especially the concentration of 500 mg l 1 has exceeded the critical micelle concentration of ctab in solution therefore different concentrations of ctab have different adhesion on the surface of microplastics and generally linear increase with increasing concentration however after the concentration exceeds the critical micelle concentration the adhesion force basically does not change greatly because the adsorption of ctab molecules on the solid surface has reached saturation szymczyk et al 2014b the adhesion work on the plastic surface at a ctab concentration of 500 mg l 1 is shown in table 1 the adhesion work of ctab in ptfe pmma ps pe and pp all increased and its values were 29 67 31 21 66 82 79 44 and 227 90 kt respectively meanwhile the zeta potential increases correspondingly due to the increase of ctab molecules on the surface of the microplastics however it can be found that the magnitude of the increase in the electrostatic force is less than the adhesion tension by calculating the electrostatic force suggesting that the ctab molecules on the surface of the microplastics can withstand greater electrostatic repulsion the electrostatic effect of ptfe pmma ps pe and pp exceeds the adhesion work at 32 29 24 23 and 15 nm respectively and the decrease in instability distance implies that the microplastics and ctab molecules are more stable when viewed as a whole because the closer the distance between microplastics the greater the energy barrier that needs to be overcome looking at it from another perspective the sum of the true radius of the microplastics and the instability distance can be regarded as the stable radius of the microplastics that is the radius range where the stability of the microplastics is affected by each other the greater the instability distance the higher is the probability of contact within the stable radius between the microplastics in addition the zeta potential on the surface of the microplastics increases due to the adhesion of more ctab molecules table 1 which means that the microplastics are more stable due to the increase in electrostatic repulsion beyond the instability distance therefore the transport ability of microplastics is all improved in a solution with a ctab concentration of 500 mg l 1 the breakthrough curve of microplastics in the presence of ctab is fitted using the ade model the results are in good agreement with our experimental data indicating that the transport of microplastics in porous media has colloidal characteristics jiang et al 2021 the best fit values for the fitting parameters i e k and smax and r2 are shown in table 1 the best smax and k values of the microplastics with low ctab concentrations were higher than those of microplastics with high ctab concentrations the change trends of the smax and k values are also consistent with the experimental results 3 2 the transport of different microplastics in the presence of sdbs the breakthrough curves of pe pp ps ptfe and pmma microplastics at different concentrations of sdbs are shown in fig 4 the transport ability of microplastics is similar to that under ctab and also follows the order of ptfe pmma ps pe pp the recovery rates of ptfe pmma ps pe and pp microplastics under 100 mg l 1 sdbs were 7 87 10 66 27 60 31 88 and 38 40 respectively and the recovery rates under 500 mg l 1 sdbs were 13 35 19 85 36 52 48 35 and 58 65 respectively table 1 the zeta potential of ptfe pmma ps pe and pp microplastics under 100 mg l 1 sdbs were 20 55 21 59 22 18 24 12 and 25 94 mv respectively and the zeta potential under 500 mg l 1 sdbs were 27 91 28 22 31 16 34 02 and 35 78 mv respectively it shows that anionic surfactants have similar abilities to cationic surfactants they can be combined with the surface of the microplastics through hydrophobic interaction the hydrophilic end faces outwards to make the surface of the microplastics negatively charged thereby increasing the migration ability of the microplastic in the porous medium jiang et al 2021 by calculating the dlvo interaction energy it is shown in fig 5 that the difference between different microplastics under sdbs is also small which indicates that the migration ability of different microplastics in porous media is also due to the difference in the adhesion of sdbs molecules on the different microplastics surface the calculated adhesion work of sdbs at a concentration of 100 mg l 1 on ptfe pmma ps pe and pp are 8 25 8 54 23 13 31 98 and 48 63 kt respectively table 1 calculating the electrostatic force between microplastics under sdbs based on zeta potential it can be deduced that the instability distances of ptfe pmma ps pe and pp under sdbs are 38 36 30 27 and 24 nm respectively in addition the transport ability of microplastics at high concentrations of sdbs is greater than that at low concentrations whether the surfactant has a positive charge or a negative charge it will cause the same migration sequence for the microplastics that is the migration ability is ptfe pmma ps pe pp the reason for controlling this phenomenon is the adhesion work of the surfactant on the surface of the microplastic the greater the adhesion work the higher is the stability of the microplastic and the stronger its transport in the porous medium it is interesting to note that the identical microplastics have weaker migration ability in anionic surfactants than cationic surfactants for example the recovery rates of pp under 100 mg l 1 and 500 mg l 1 ctab are 73 10 and 99 92 respectively but the recovery rates under sdbs are 38 40 and 58 65 respectively the reason is that the hydrophilic end of the cationic surfactant ctab can be adsorbed on the surface of the quartz sand by electrostatic force and the hydrophobic end faces the water phase the hydrophobic chains of ctab in the solution and the hydrophobic chains on the quartz sand surface form a double layer of ctab molecular coverage on the quartz sand surface by a combination of hydrophobic interaction sun et al 2015 however the anionic surfactant sdbs has the same negative charge as the surface of the quartz sand which generates electrostatic repulsion and cannot be adsorbed on the surface of the quartz sand as shown in table 1 the zeta potential of the quartz sand surface under ctab is positive which confirms that the surface of the quartz sand is covered with a double layer of ctab molecules surfactant as a long chain molecule has osmotic effect and elastic repulsion which leads to the contact of microplastics and quartz sand in ctab solution will be affected by the elastic repulsion and osmotic force of three layers of surfactant molecules li et al 2018 as for sdbs it cannot be attached to the surface of quartz sand due to electrostatic repulsion only the surface of the microplastic has a single layer of sdbs molecules and the elastic repulsion and osmotic force are weaker than ctab on this basis the xdlvo interaction energy between microplastics and quartz sand with elastic repulsion and osmotic force added was calculated in supplementary figure s5 it is shown that the interaction energy between microplastics and quartz sand in the presence of sdbs is much smaller than ctab indicating that microplastics are more stable in ctab and are not easy to deposit on the surface of quartz sand these observations indicate that the osmotic and elastic repulsion generated by ctab is much greater than that of sdbs which makes the transport of microplastics in ctab very strong 3 3 effect of surfactants concentration on the transport of different microplastics in the presence of ctab or sdbs the difference in transport ability of ptfe pmma ps pe and pp depends on the adhesion work of surfactant molecules on the surface of microplastics the migration ability of the microplastics is also improved with the surfactant concentration increasing because the adhesion work of the surfactant on the surface of the microplastics is greater at high concentrations however the results shown in figs 1 4 and s6 show that the migration ability of the microplastics does not change significantly when the surfactant concentration is 300 500 and 1000 mg l 1 therefore the influence of ctab or sdbs concentration changes on the migration of microplastics was further explored the critical micelle concentrations of ctab and sdbs are 327 21 and 481 mg l 1 respectively fig s1 when the surfactant concentration is higher than the critical micelle concentration ctab and sdbs molecules are already close together even if the concentration is increasing it will not affect the amount of surfactant attached to the surface of the microplastics tiberg et al 1999 the maximum adhesion amount of surfactant at the interface is related to the smallest area occupied by surfactant molecules on the interface and this area depends on the surface structure of different microplastics szymczyk et al 2014b for example pmma microplastics have both lorentz van der waals force and hydrophobic interaction force on the surface due to the presence of oxygen functional groups which results in the adsorption of surfactant molecules on the pmma surface at a certain angle instead of an upright state hu et al 2015 miyamae and nozoye 2003 in this case ctab and sdbs molecules occupy a larger area in pmma microplastics which makes the adhesion work of ctab and sdbs at the pmma interface smaller in order to qualitatively understand the relationship between the area occupied by single surfactant molecules asl and the migration ability of the microplastics according to these data in table s2 correlation analysis between area occupied by single surfactant molecules and the recovery rate of different microplastics is performed the specific calculation formula for the area occupied by single surfactant molecules at different concentrations can be found in the supplementary information s2 s3 it clearly shows that there is a significant negative correlation between the occupied area and the migration ability of the microplastics fig 6 with a correlation coefficient r2 0 9 as mentioned above the surfactant occupies a smaller area at the microplastic interface which is more conducive to the formation of a stable surfactant microplastic combination therefore the results show that the area occupied by single ctab or sdbs molecules at the interface leads to different adhesion work formed on the surface of the microplastics which leads to a significant difference in the migration ability of the microplastics in addition the surfactant concentration will affect the area occupied by the single molecule at the interface fig 6 indicates that the slope value of the recovery rate of microplastics and the occupied area usually follows 1000 500 300 200 100 mg l 1 the slope of the recovery rate and the occupied area indicates that the tendency of the migration ability of the microplastics to increase varies with the value of the area occupied by the surfactant in other words the smaller the absolute value of the slope it indicates that the migration capacity of the microplastics increases as the occupied area decreases according to the occupied area value it can be found that the occupied area of single ctab and sdbs molecules at the interface decreases rapidly as the concentration increases the results show that when the surfactant concentration is lower than the critical micelle concentration the enhancement effect of the surfactant on the mobility of the microplastics is related to the surfactant concentration 4 conclusions the presence of surfactants was effective in increasing the migration of microplastics in the presence of ctab or sdbs the transport ability of different microplastics namely ptfe pmma ps pe and pp depended on the adhesion work of surfactant molecules on the microplastics surface when the microplastics were close to each other the electrostatic repulsion prevents the two parties from approaching if the reaction force of the electrostatic force in the approaching process was greater than the adhesion force of ctab molecules on the surface it would inevitably lead to the ctab molecules to break away from the microplastics which reduced the stability of the microplastics the adhesion tension of ctab or sdbs on ptfe pmma ps pe and pp was ptfe pmma ps pe pp and the adhesion work of surfactant molecules on ptfe and pmma was much smaller than that of pp and pe this phenomenon was consistent with the transport behavior of microplastics in this study the adhesion work of the surfactant at the interface was related to the smallest area occupied by the single surfactant molecule on the interface correlation analysis between the area and the recovery rate of different microplastics showed that the smaller the area occupied by the single surfactant molecules at the microplastic interface the better it was to form a stable surfactant microplastic combination and improve the migration ability of the microplastic in addition since the osmotic and elastic repulsion generated by ctab were much greater than that of sdbs the migration ability of microplastics in sdbs was weaker than that of ctab therefore the migration of microplastics in groundwater contaminated by surfactants must be carefully

sludge production wwtp wastewater treatment plant y c h 4 methane yield 1 introduction anaerobic treatment of municipal wastewater mww has several advantages over conventional aerobic processes as has been widely recognized over the years its main advantages are low sludge production due to low anaerobic biomass yield giménez et al 2011 reduced energy consumption because no aeration is required lee et al 2017 methane is produced from organic matter valorization which improves the technology s energy balance krzeminski et al 2017 low greenhouse gas emissions when methane is recovered from both biogas and effluent streams jiménez benítez et al 2020b and potential recovery potential of nutrients content batstone and virdis 2014 moreover the limitations associated with anaerobic processes applied to low organic strength wastewaters e g low growth rate of anaerobic biomass at ambient temperature or poor sludge settling properties can be overcome by combining membrane technology and anaerobic reactors in the so called anaerobic membrane bioreactor anmbr ozgun et al 2013 where the filtration process allows complete physical biomass retention hydraulic retention time hrt and sludge retention time srt can thus be decoupled which means high rate reactors can be designed and high quality effluent suitable for water reclamation can be achieved with the appropriate membrane pore size jiménez benítez et al 2020a eventually membrane modules are more compact than the equivalent secondary settlers disinfection units e g uv process which helps to reduce the layout footprint of wastewater treatment facilities and permits existing space constrained treatment plants to be retrofitted xiao et al 2019 a high concentration of nutrients mainly nitrogen and phosphorus but also magnesium potassium etc in the effluent of anaerobic processes has traditionally been considered a significant environmental risk to aquatic ecosystems eutrophication and potable water resources when these streams are discharged pretel et al 2016 rodriguez garcia et al 2011 this being true it is also possible to consider it as an opportunity to introduce the fundamentals of the circular economy ce to wastewater treatment since anaerobic treatments can be used to recover nutrients recovery plus recycling would contribute to closing both the materials and energy loops and several processes and technologies are already available or being investigated to take advantage of these essential resources for agriculture and industry robles et al 2020a including these resources in a comprehensive nutrient management system is becoming more important as shown among others by the interest shown by the european union in this matter european commission 2015 at the present time most efforts focus on the p since this element and phosphorite were included in european critical raw materials lists in 2017 and 2014 respectively however n recovery is also attracting attention because of the high energy consumption and associated greenhouse gas emissions from its fixation from atmospheric n2 nutrient recovery thus helps to reduce both the dependence on their production and or imports which is even more important for those that are exhaustible such as phosphorus and potassium and greenhouse gases ghg associated with mineral fertilizers whose production results in significant energy expenditure mccarty et al 2011 and has an environmental impact biosolids production has also been identified as a key issue in wastewater treatment aerobic processes are characterized by high sludge production associated with a high biomass yield of aerobic metabolism which involves a significant management cost that affects the economic and environmental performance of sewage treatments additionally the regulation of waste sewage sludge which is a challenge in wastewater treatment processes is also expected to be tightened collivignarelli et al 2019 anmbr can help to overcome these problems in two ways firstly the anaerobic process mineralizes organic matter with reduced anabolism and low sludge production by a way of example foladori et al 2015 reported a sludge production in aerobic wwtps of 0 25 0 35 kg vss per kg cod removed unstabilized sludge and around 0 18 kg vss per kg cod removed for stabilized sludge respectively while robles et al 2020 reported a stabilized sludge production in an anmbr demonstration plant treating mww of 0 148 kg vss per kg cod removed secondly biomass retention by membrane modules allows increasing srt which contributes to achieve on site sludge stabilization and reduces or even avoids further sludge treatment a final consideration is that anaerobic removal of organic matter generates methane a storable energy carrier suitable to produce renewable heat and power boosting anaerobic processes through anmbr may thus improve the energy balance of existing wastewater treatment facilities using it as the core technology would take full advantage of the organic matter and the associated energy embedded in wastewater at the same time reduction of ghg emissions would be expected when grid energy consumption is replaced by energy recovery provided by this methane however despite these indisputable benefits anmbr technology presents three fundamental challenges i competition between sulfate reducing bacteria srb and methanogens ma for the same substrates reduces methane yields when treating influents with high sulfate contents durán et al 2020 ii reduction of sulfate by srb produces sulfide and hydrogen sulfide which eventually could entail inhibition in anaerobic metabolism and needs to be considered in energy recovery and water reclamation processes and iii dissolved methane losses through the effluent reduce energy recovery and especially increase ghg emissions jiménez benítez et al 2020b in this sense co digestion e g the organic fraction of municipal waste food waste etc has been explored to increase influent organic load and thus increase methane production karki et al 2021 moñino et al 2017 while several promising technologies for dissolved methane recovery e g pdms membranes are also being studied sanchis perucho et al 2020 crone et al 2016 anmbr technology is thus a clear candidate for renewing the wastewater treatment approach and would contribute to the economic environmental and social goals of water management with ce playing an active role persevering with a business as usual scenario based on conventional technologies which have been shown to be effective but not efficient would entail ignoring the current global context climate change energy transition resource depletion and environment degradation this work describes the results of operating of an anmbr semi industrial plant demonstration scale trl of 6 for mww treatment at the alcázar de san juan wwtp alcázar de san juan ciudad real spain the size of the prototype together with being fed with real mww and operated for more than 2 5 years means it can be considered a reliable and robust source of performance data the main objective of the study was to contrast anmbr with conventional wastewater treatments and demonstrate its potential benefits 2 materials and methods 2 1 anmbr description and operation fig 1 shows the process and instrumentation diagram p id of the semi industrial anmbr plant operated in this work this plant mainly consists of a 40 m3 c a 34 4 m3 working volume 5 6 m3 headspace anaerobic reactor connected to three 0 8 m3 membrane tanks c a 0 7 m3 working volume 0 1 m3 headspace each membrane tank was fitted with one ultrafiltration membrane system puron psh41 kms 0 03 µm pore size total filtration area of 41 m2 giving a total filtration area of 123 m2 a sieve screw rt 1 5 mm screen size an equalization tank 1 1 m3 and a clean in place tank 0 37 m3 were the other main elements in the plant total sludge volume was recorded considering the working volumes of both the anaerobic reactor and membrane tanks accounting for 36 32 1 63 m3 during the operating period the anmbr was equipped with a 2 1 m2 degassing membrane unit for dissolved methane recovery consisting of a polydimethylsiloxane pdms hollow fiber commercial module provided by permselect medarray inc usa the plant was fed with effluent from the pre treatment step sand and grease removal of the alcázar de san juan wwtp alcázar de san juan ciudad real spain further details of this anmbr system can be found in robles et al 2020 regarding filtration process the system was able to operate with transmembrane flux in the range 14 21 lmh with moderate sparging gas demand 11 14 nm3 biogas m 3 permeate and significant total suspended solids tss 8 13 g l 1 transmembrane pressures varied between 87 and 490 mbar and fouling rates between 1 7 and 16 6 mbar d 1 only two chemical cleanings of membrane were needed during the considered experimental period the semi industrial plant performance was assessed from two points of view i considering the 610 days of operations included in this work and ii selecting 5 periods from the overall operating period it is important to highlight the variable influent quality and the relatively high cod and bod concentrations due to the contributions of several nearby dairy and wine industries during the operation period and based on data obtained in previous anmbr pilot plant studies giménez et al 2014 2012 seco et al 2018 srt was maintained at 70 days and the plant was operated at two different hrt 25 26 and 41 hours temperature varied freely between 10 and 27 c ambient temperature operation while olr was in the range between 0 60 0 20 and 1 28 0 38 kg cod m 3 d 1 table 1 shows the characterization of the influent and effluent streams together with the main operating conditions during the five selected periods 2 2 anmbr monitoring the following parameters were regularly monitored in the influent total cod and bod5 sulfate so 4 2 s sulfide hs s total nitrogen nt total phosphorus pt nitrate no3 n phosphate po4 3 p tss and volatile suspended solids vss effluent characterization comprised total cod nt pt and hs s and volatile fatty acids vfa finally reactor monitoring was based on tss vss cod ph temperature and methane content in the biogas ch4 dissolved methane in the effluent was calculated by henry s law and assuming saturation conditions ph temperature and biogas flow rate were registered online 24 hour composite samples were taken from the influent twice a week for all measurements except for cod which was analyzed daily grab samples were taken twice a week from the effluent and mixed liquor 2 3 analytical methods tss vss cod bod5 sulfate sulfide and nutrients were determined according to standard methods apha 2005 vfa concentration was determined by titration according to the method proposed by moosbrugger et al 1992 2 4 data processing and calculations different key performance indicators were calculated to evaluate the performance of the system as shown in robles et al 2020 i e methane yield taking into account the methane dissolved in the permeate cod removal rates and biosolids production 3 results and discussion the performance of the demonstration plant was evaluated for 610 days five periods were further characterized to assess the robustness of the anmbr technology against the disturbances in the main operating conditions derived from the natural variations throughout the year 3 1 organic removal efficiency fig 2 shows the 15 day moving average for the influent organic load along with its 95 confidence bands the daily average temperature and both the removed and biodegraded cod the influent organic load was highly variable mainly due to the aforementioned variable industrial discharges biodegraded cod accounted for the cod that was biologically removed by srb or was transformed into methane by ma whereas the removed cod also considered the physically retained cod by the ultrafiltration process besides the biodegraded cod conversely the influent sulfate concentration variation was moderate resulting in different cod so 4 2 s ratios for each period see table 1 the temperature followed the natural variations in mid latitude temperate climates with strong variations between day to night data not shown and summer to winter the daily average temperature difference from winter to summer was higher than 17 c the hrt was varied to simulate population shifts during summer and winter periods as a result of population density changes during vacation periods initially hrt was set to 41 hours in period p1 in accordance with the low population density in coastal areas before the summer hrt was almost halved from p1 to p2 25 1 h and p4 26 2 h to simulate the intensification of water usage by the massive influx of tourists in coastal areas during vacation periods similarly p3 y p5 were operated at the same low temperature 19 1 and 18 1 c respectively but different hrt 25 1 h in p3 and 41 13 h in p5 to simulate population variation during the winter period hrt was kept practically constant from period p2 to period p4 around 25 h representing densely populated all year long areas however as shown in table 1 the olr decreased 1 28 0 38 kg cod m 3 d 1 in p2 0 82 0 19 kg cod m 3 d 1 in p3 and 0 71 0 23 kg cod m 3 d 1 in p4 as a result of the drop in the influent cod concentrations 1403 532 mg l 1 in p2 896 201 mg l 1 in p3 and 755 224 mg l 1 in p4 which was attributed to changes in the activity of the industries that discharge into the sewer system the sulfate concentration also decreased from period p2 172 2 28 5 mg s l 1 to period p3 125 4 47 6 mg s l 1 albeit the cod reduction was more significant resulting in a lower cod so 4 2 s ratio conversely the sulfate concentration in period p4 157 3 46 9 mg s l 1 was higher than in period p3 despite the fact that cod concentration continued to fall both contributing to a significant reduction in the cod so 4 2 s ratio so 4 2 s concentration in period p5 149 7 26 9 mg s l 1 remaining similar to p4 the increased influent cod concentration in period p5 1038 238 mg l 1 thus resulted in a higher cod so 4 2 s ratio despite the higher cod concentration olr was lower in period p5 0 60 0 20 kg cod m 3 d 1 than in period p4 as a result of the higher hrt in period p5 fig 2 shows that cod removal accounted for an average of 87 2 6 1 of the influent cod 87 of the cod removal data was higher than 80 whilst almost 40 of the cod removal data was over 90 the membranes were able to virtually retain all particulates however the occasional unbalanced performance of the different stages in anaerobic degradation due to low temperatures or organic load peaks accumulated intermediate soluble organics that were able to pass through the membrane thus increasing the effluent cod and reducing cod removal cod was not completely biodegraded by srb or by ma conversely a fraction of the removed cod was simply retained within the system due to membrane filtration helping to increase the solids concentration and therefore waste sludge production regarding the biologically removed cod sulfate concentration was virtually zero in the effluent indicating that srb completely reduced influent sulfate 2 grams of cod were consumed per gram of so 4 2 s reduced the analysis of the variance anova of the cod consumed by srb expressed as olr srb i e the influent olr which is consumed by srb found a significant difference between the mean values in the different periods p value 0 0 see complementary material nevertheless fischer s least significant difference lsd method for the pairwise comparison of mean values in the different periods were fairly similar in the mean values for the olr srb among periods p1 and p5 and between periods p2 and p4 while p3 had an intermediate mean value the remaining cod was theoretically available for ma i e olr ma in the proportion shown in fig 3 as can be seen in this figure the olr in period p2 was much higher than the others as a result of the strengthened influent wastewater organic load during p2 24 5 of the olr was consumed by sbr olr sbr while 75 5 remained available for ma olr ma on the other hand p4 showed the lowest olr ma 58 3 the p value for the analysis of the variance of the olr ma see complementary material in each period was lower than 0 05 p value 0 0 again indicating a significant difference between the mean values in the different periods in this case fischer s lsd method found significant similarity between mean values of p1 and p3 and between p4 and p5 p2 had the highest mean value for olr available for ma due to the high treatment flow and influent cod concentration the system s response to organic load peaks entailed an accumulation of vfa likely due to the faster response of acid generating than acid consuming organisms although the system was able quickly restore the equilibrium the vfa effluent concentrations were low in the periods with longer hrt p1 and p5 and moderate organic overloads also higher operating temperatures were associated with lower vfa concentrations p1 p2 and p4 in contrast the combination of short hrt and lower temperature of p3 led to more severe organic overloading and hindered accumulated vfa consumption resulting in the highest vfa effluent concentrations see table 1 this result is attributed to the more severe impairment of acid consuming organisms which seemed to be more affected by lower temperatures than acid producing organisms 3 2 methane production table 2 shows the percentages of the cod removed by filtration and biodegradation and biodegraded cod as aforementioned the cod removed was higher in periods p1 93 1 6 3 and p5 92 5 3 5 when hrt was higher 41 1 and 41 13 h respectively indicating that the extended contact time between soluble organics and anaerobic microorganisms enabled ma to further consume the organic matter and produce ch4 and co2 the absence of intermediate products indicates that the intermediate anaerobic degradation steps were properly balanced hydrolysis and solubilization being the limiting steps the percentage of biodegraded cod in p1 and p2 was higher than the rest of the periods 71 3 27 7 and 74 4 14 5 respectively due to their high influent cod concentration 1285 429 mg cod l 1 in p1 and 1403 532 mg cod l 1 in p2 and temperature 27 1 c and 24 2 c respectively which favored bacterial metabolism and hence organic matter consumption p4 with 63 4 26 2 of biodegraded cod also presents a high operating temperature 27 1 c but also the lowest influent cod concentration 755 224 mg cod l 1 the percentage of biodegraded cod in p4 is similar to those obtained in p3 61 0 16 2 and p5 61 4 13 0 operated at low temperatures 18 2 c and 19 1 c respectively but with higher influent cod 896 201 mg cod l 1 in p3 and 1038 238 mg cod l 1 in p5 fig 4 depicts the time evolution of the 15 day moving average biogas production along with its 95 confidence bands as can be seen the biogas production trend was directly related to the fraction of cod load available for ma ol ma although it was also influenced by temperature which limited the production of substrates for srb and ma as a result of the reduction in the hydrolysis and solubilization rates the capacity of the system to recover energy was evaluated in terms of methane yield y c h 4 which stands for the amount of methane produced per unit of influent cod the biomethane potential bmp representing the fraction of the influent cod that ended up as methane by comparing y c h 4 to the theoretical maximal methane production i e 350 stp l ch4 kg 1 cod was also calculated the resulting y c h 4 and bmp in the different periods are shown in table 2 however only the results regarding y c h 4 will be discussed since the bmp results followed the same trend the highest y c h 4 value was obtained in p1 169 0 95 1 stp l ch4 kg 1 cod with a combination of high t 27 1 οc and hrt 41 1 h its influent cod so 4 2 s ratio was also the most favorable for methane production 8 70 3 69 cod g 1 so 4 2 s while a high temperature enhanced the hydrolysis rate which is considered the limiting stage in anaerobic digestion methane production increased with the cod available for ma for which p1 had the highest percentage of influent cod available for ma 77 0 see fig 3 in contrast the slight temperature drop and reduced hrt reduction between periods p1 and p2 24 2 οc and 25 1 h respectively helped to reduce the y c h 4 to 109 6 70 0 stp l ch4 kg 1 cod even when fischer s lsd method showed that the amount of cod for ma in p2 was the highest 35 kg d 1 it is important to highlight that an error of 18 5 was obtained when cod mass balance was applied to p2 see fig 5 and discussed in section 3 5 this cod loss could be attributed to underestimated biogas production as mentioned above dissolved methane in the effluent was calculated assuming saturation conditions although there could have been oversaturation episodes pauss et al 1990 p3 and p4 present the lowest y c h 4 values 75 2 16 9 and 70 2 36 0 stp l ch4 kg 1 cod respectively these results can also be explained by the temperature hrt and cod so 4 2 s ratio despite p3 being operated with a moderate influent cod so 4 2 s ratio 7 14 4 31 g cod g 1 so 4 2 s and available organic matter 72 0 influent cod could not offset its low operating temperature 19 1 c and hrt 26 2 h which hindered hydrolysis and possibly also methane production in p4 the operating temperature was favorable 27 1 c and hrt remained at 26 2 h but the cod so 4 2 s ratio was significantly lower than in the other periods 4 80 2 86 g cod g 1 so 4 2 s which justifies the lower y c h 4 finally similar y c h 4 values were obtained for p2 and p5 109 6 70 0 and 102 3 63 8 stp l ch4 kg 1 cod respectively in this case p2 had high temperature 24 2 c and high cod so 4 2 s ratio 8 15 4 44 g cod g 1 so 4 2 s but lower hrt 25 1 h p5 operated at high hrt 41 13 h a moderate influent cod so 4 2 s ratio 6 94 2 83 g cod g 1 so 4 2 s but the lowest temperature 18 2 c considering that influent quality cannot be modified hrt thus becomes the main design parameter for maximizing methane production in low winter temperatures it should be remembered that influent sulfate concentration depends on the region in which the wastewater is generated since it is associated with the concentration of sulfate in water sources as well as the possible contribution of factories that discharge sulfur to the sewage system since the cod consumed by srb is biodegradable and should have undergone at least the first stages of anaerobic degradation i e hydrolysis and solubilization to be available for srb it would also have been available for ma a sulfate free influent would thus have yielded a much higher y c h 4 and bmp would have been similar to the percentage of biodegraded cod as way of example methane yields without considering the cod consumed by srb in the studied periods y s o 4 c h 4 would rise to 87 4 191 0 stp l ch4 kg 1 cod however in sulphate rich wastewater the role of srb in reducing the effluent soluble cod when hrt is reduced must be considered since srb has higher degradation rates than ma especially at lower temperatures 3 3 biosolids the waste sludge production wsp expressed in kg vss per kg of influent cod and per kg of removed cod is shown in table 2 the reported values are the outcome of a complex interaction between operational conditions and influent characteristics the fraction and composition of particulates in the influent and their fate within the system which depends on the operating conditions temperature hrt and especially srt influence the accumulation and retention of biosolids and therefore increased wsp a greater influx of solids into the system entails greater accumulation and retention unless the operating conditions favor hydrolysis and solubilization on the other hand hydrolysis is widely accepted as the limiting step in anaerobic degradation and is severely affected by temperature drops batstone 2006 although temperature also affects the following steps of the anaerobic degradation results indicated that intermediates accumulation can be mitigated as long as hrt is high enough in the same way wsp can also be reduced by increasing system srt thus extending the time for further hydrolysis and solubilization of the accumulated solids as can be seen in table 2 p3 had the highest wsp 0 166 0 074 kg vss kg 1 codrem mainly due to the low temperature 19 1 c the operating conditions hindered biodegradability and therefore raised sludge production p4 and p5 also had high wsp 0 150 0 079 kg vss kg 1 codrem and 0 148 0 072 kg vss kg 1 codrem respectively although lower than p1 the high production in p5 can be attributed to the lowest operating temperature 18 2 c however despite temperature in p4 being the highest 27 1 c the significant wsp in this period was associated with its low cod so 4 2 s 4 80 2 86 g cod g 1 so 4 2 s in this period the percentage of influent cod consumed by srb accounted for 41 7 while in the other periods was below 29 since the srb biomass yield was significantly higher than ma the associated solids production was also higher as was sludge production in this period durán et al 2020 finally p1 and p2 had the lowest wsp 0 121 0 067 and 0 103 0 044 kg vss kg 1 codrem respectively both were operated at high temperature 27 1 c in p1 and 24 2 c in p2 and had the highest cod so 4 2 s ratio 8 70 3 69 g cod g 1 so 4 2 s and 8 15 4 44 g cod g 1 so 4 2 s respectively the combination of both variables enhanced ma organic matter biodegradation and reduced sludge production p2 was also characterized by the highest percentage of influent vss cod and bod5 indicating the highest influent wastewater biodegradability and that the operating conditions were appropriate for the maximum biosolids degradation it is important to highlight that besides the complex interaction of factors that affect the wsp it can be as low as 0 103 0 044 kg vss kg 1 codrem as a way of comparison foladori et al 2015 reported 0 23 0 35 kg vss kg 1 codrem srt of around 10 20 days and 0 18 kg vss kg 1 codrem for aerobic treatment without and with sludge stabilization respectively according to these values all the selected periods had lower wsp than the aerobic treatments with percentage reductions between 8 p3 and 43 p2 increasing srt over 70 days could be expected to lead to lower wsp and additional biosolids stabilization although solids concentration in the reactor would also rise and affect processes such as membrane filtration in the operating stage or increase reactor capacities requirements in the design stage in this regard ji et al 2020 obtained a wsp of 0 09 kg vss kg 1 codrem operating two different anmbr with different pore size membranes for 120 days at 25οc in this work no excess sludge was wasted during long term operations except for the sludge samples this value confirms that it is possible to achieve low wsp with high srts on the other hand with the same technology seco et al 2018 reported a wsp of 0 218 kg vss kg 1 codrem with an srt of 140 days and 27οc design and operating conditions thus need to be carefully selected taking influent characteristics into account and especially the particulate cod and cod so 4 2 s ratio 3 4 nutrients recovery potential anaerobic treatments have low nutrients requirements per cod removed as can be seen from the effluent characterization shown in table 1 which confirms that anmbr is promising technology for turning wastewater into a source of nutrients nt and pt concentrations in the effluent accounted for 37 0 54 0 mgn l 1 and 6 3 9 9 mgp l 1 respectively considering the treatment capacity of alcázar de san juan wwtp 16000 m3 d 1 these concentrations represent 216 315 t n year 1 and 37 58 t p year 1 it should be noted that over 90 of european phosphorus applications are import dependent so that wastewater can play an active role as a p supplier by combining anmbr and ce fundamentals rosemarin et al 2020 selecting urea co nh2 2 and p2o5 as representative n based and p based fertilizers respectively nutrients equivalent to 463 676 t urea year 1 and 84 132 t p2o5 year 1 could be provided by effluent if a price of 273 6 per t of urea bib31 and 783 0 per t of p2o5 bib30 is assumed the mineral fertilizer equivalent value of the nutrients in the discharge flow would be between k 162 and k 230 per year and would pay for 10 15 of water treatment costs at 0 269 per m3 for anmbr jiménez benítez et al 2020a to reduce production costs and impact an alternative embedded nutrient strategy consists of direct reuse fertigation instead of producing fertilizers from effluent which makes anmbr technology especially suitable for decentralized plants in rural areas where the effluent can be discharged directly to farmland it is important to highlight that apart from a nutrient rich stream the combination of an anaerobic process with uf membrane implemented in an anmbr produces an effluent free of solids and pathogens krzeminski et al 2017 which makes it especially appropriate for fertigation for example alcázar de san juan wwtp could cover

cod associated with biogas cod from dissolved methane cod wasted with sludge cod in the effluent and mass balance error p1 shows no mass balance error but periods p2 to p5 have positive values in all cases indicating that the influent cod is higher than cod leaving the system through biogas effluent wasted sludge and cod biodegraded by srb the errors in p4 1 7 and p5 3 3 are negligible while p2 and p3 show significant errors 18 5 and 11 6 respectively as all the parameters involved in cod mass balance e g flow rates cod concentration biogas production waste sludge etc are based on analytical and or on line measurements except for dissolved methane calculated as stated in section 2 2 it is hypothesized that in these two periods dissolved methane in the effluent have been underestimated as mentioned above dissolved methane is calculated considering saturation conditions based on henry s law although oversaturation could take place in these periods due to methane bubbles passing through the membranes or poor reactor mixing fig 5 confirms the influence of operating at high t hrt and cod so 4 2 s ratio to enhance methane production with p1 p2 and p5 showing the highest percentages of biogas associated to cod p1 operated at the highest temperature hrt and cod so 4 2 s ratio 27 1 c 41 1 h and 8 70 3 69 g cod g 1 so 4 2 s respectively shows a percentage of 43 5 of biogas associated cod the highest value p2 was operated at high temperature 24 2 c and a favorable cod so 4 2 s ratio 8 15 4 44 g cod g 1 s both conditions could offset the lower hrt 25 1 h and kept biogas production at significant percentages 26 5 if the cod mass balance error 18 5 is attributed to underestimated methane production the biogas percentage could rise to 45 as in p1 p5 also presented significant biogas production 22 2 this period operated at high hrt 41 1 h and moderate influent cod so 4 2 s ratio 6 94 2 83 g cod g 1 so 4 2 s but the lowest t 18 2 c which hindered methane production since a negligible error was obtained for this period potential increased biogas production due to underestimated dissolved methane cannot be considered the lowest percentages of cod associated with biogas were obtained in p3 13 6 and p4 11 6 p3 operated at a low temperature 19 1 c and hrt 26 2 h and therefore with low biogas production despite a favorable influent cod so 4 2 s ratio 7 14 4 31 g cod g 1 so 4 2 s similar to p5 however if mass balance error is considered 11 6 biogas associated cod could rise to 25 2 p4 with low hrt 26 2 h and the lowest influent cod so 4 2 s ratio 4 80 2 86 g cod g 1 so 4 2 s had the lowest cod percentage associated with methane production 11 6 despite its favorable operating temperature 27 1 c for the cod associated with waste sludge fig 5 shows that p5 had the highest percentage 31 1 this period operated at the lowest t 18 2 c which hindered particulate degradation and the lowest olr 0 60 0 20 kg cod m 3 d 1 since olr before p5 was higher than in this period see fig 2 the sludge wasted during p5 could have been influenced by accumulated vss p2 had a percentage of 17 2 due to its favorable operating temperature 24 2 c and the highest olr 1 28 0 38 kg cod m 3 d 1 p3 and p4 show a similar percentage associated with waste sludge 25 6 and 26 1 respectively despite operating at very different temperatures 19 1 c in p3 and 27 1 in p4 c this can be attributed to the higher cod percentage consumed by srb 41 7 in p4 as these bacteria have a higher growth yield than ma and therefore increase solids production in the reactor the results show an overall promising performance of anmbr technology for treating mww at ambient temperature the cod removal capacity allows compliance with treatment regulation e g mwwtd methane yields indicate its potential for organic matter valorization and energy recovery and nutrient content in the effluent indicates its capacity for turning wastewater into a valuable source of nutrients low waste sludge production means anmbr can be considered a robust candidate as the new core technology to boost the transition of wastewater treatment plants towards the new resource recovery facilities especially suitable for small and decentralized plants in which anaerobic processes are not currently applied temperature hrt srt and cod so 4 2 s ratio are crucial parameters to improve technological economic and environmental performance of anmbr technology for wastewater treatment hrt and srt being the only ones which do not depend on ambient conditions both hrt and srt thus appear as the main design parameter it is important to highlight the benefits that the implementation and optimization of dissolved methane recovery technologies e g hollow fiber membranes can provide to anmbr dissolved methane will improve the wastewater treatment energy balances while the carbon footprint associated with greenhouse gas emissions is minimized 4 conclusions an industrial anmbr prototype was operated for 610 days during which an average of 87 2 6 1 of influent cod removal was achieved with 87 of the data over 80 and almost 40 over 90 uf membranes contributed to wastewater treatment by retaining almost all the particulates in addition in the long term operations 5 periods were selected to evaluate the performance of the anmbr in these periods a y c h 4 between 70 2 and 169 0 stp l ch4 kg 1 cod were achieved and methane percentages in the biogas varied from 75 to 77 sludge production ranged between 0 103 0 044 and 0 166 0 074 kg vss kg 1 codrem which represents a reduction of 9 to 43 compared to cas a significant nutrient recovery potential was also identified finally temperature hrt and cod so 4 2 s ratio jointly with srt are crucial parameters to take into account in maximizing anmbr s technical economic and environmental performance however since temperature and influent cod so 4 2 s depend on ambient conditions hrt could be considered the main design parameter jointly with

sludge production wwtp wastewater treatment plant y c h 4 methane yield 1 introduction anaerobic treatment of municipal wastewater mww has several advantages over conventional aerobic processes as has been widely recognized over the years its main advantages are low sludge production due to low anaerobic biomass yield giménez et al 2011 reduced energy consumption because no aeration is required lee et al 2017 methane is produced from organic matter valorization which improves the technology s energy balance krzeminski et al 2017 low greenhouse gas emissions when methane is recovered from both biogas and effluent streams jiménez benítez et al 2020b and potential recovery potential of nutrients content batstone and virdis 2014 moreover the limitations associated with anaerobic processes applied to low organic strength wastewaters e g low growth rate of anaerobic biomass at ambient temperature or poor sludge settling properties can be overcome by combining membrane technology and anaerobic reactors in the so called anaerobic membrane bioreactor anmbr ozgun et al 2013 where the filtration process allows complete physical biomass retention hydraulic retention time hrt and sludge retention time srt can thus be decoupled which means high rate reactors can be designed and high quality effluent suitable for water reclamation can be achieved with the appropriate membrane pore size jiménez benítez et al 2020a eventually membrane modules are more compact than the equivalent secondary settlers disinfection units e g uv process which helps to reduce the layout footprint of wastewater treatment facilities and permits existing space constrained treatment plants to be retrofitted xiao et al 2019 a high concentration of nutrients mainly nitrogen and phosphorus but also magnesium potassium etc in the effluent of anaerobic processes has traditionally been considered a significant environmental risk to aquatic ecosystems eutrophication and potable water resources when these streams are discharged pretel et al 2016 rodriguez garcia et al 2011 this being true it is also possible to consider it as an opportunity to introduce the fundamentals of the circular economy ce to wastewater treatment since anaerobic treatments can be used to recover nutrients recovery plus recycling would contribute to closing both the materials and energy loops and several processes and technologies are already available or being investigated to take advantage of these essential resources for agriculture and industry robles et al 2020a including these resources in a comprehensive nutrient management system is becoming more important as shown among others by the interest shown by the european union in this matter european commission 2015 at the present time most efforts focus on the p since this element and phosphorite were included in european critical raw materials lists in 2017 and 2014 respectively however n recovery is also attracting attention because of the high energy consumption and associated greenhouse gas emissions from its fixation from atmospheric n2 nutrient recovery thus helps to reduce both the dependence on their production and or imports which is even more important for those that are exhaustible such as phosphorus and potassium and greenhouse gases ghg associated with mineral fertilizers whose production results in significant energy expenditure mccarty et al 2011 and has an environmental impact biosolids production has also been identified as a key issue in wastewater treatment aerobic processes are characterized by high sludge production associated with a high biomass yield of aerobic metabolism which involves a significant management cost that affects the economic and environmental performance of sewage treatments additionally the regulation of waste sewage sludge which is a challenge in wastewater treatment processes is also expected to be tightened collivignarelli et al 2019 anmbr can help to overcome these problems in two ways firstly the anaerobic process mineralizes organic matter with reduced anabolism and low sludge production by a way of example foladori et al 2015 reported a sludge production in aerobic wwtps of 0 25 0 35 kg vss per kg cod removed unstabilized sludge and around 0 18 kg vss per kg cod removed for stabilized sludge respectively while robles et al 2020 reported a stabilized sludge production in an anmbr demonstration plant treating mww of 0 148 kg vss per kg cod removed secondly biomass retention by membrane modules allows increasing srt which contributes to achieve on site sludge stabilization and reduces or even avoids further sludge treatment a final consideration is that anaerobic removal of organic matter generates methane a storable energy carrier suitable to produce renewable heat and power boosting anaerobic processes through anmbr may thus improve the energy balance of existing wastewater treatment facilities using it as the core technology would take full advantage of the organic matter and the associated energy embedded in wastewater at the same time reduction of ghg emissions would be expected when grid energy consumption is replaced by energy recovery provided by this methane however despite these indisputable benefits anmbr technology presents three fundamental challenges i competition between sulfate reducing bacteria srb and methanogens ma for the same substrates reduces methane yields when treating influents with high sulfate contents durán et al 2020 ii reduction of sulfate by srb produces sulfide and hydrogen sulfide which eventually could entail inhibition in anaerobic metabolism and needs to be considered in energy recovery and water reclamation processes and iii dissolved methane losses through the effluent reduce energy recovery and especially increase ghg emissions jiménez benítez et al 2020b in this sense co digestion e g the organic fraction of municipal waste food waste etc has been explored to increase influent organic load and thus increase methane production karki et al 2021 moñino et al 2017 while several promising technologies for dissolved methane recovery e g pdms membranes are also being studied sanchis perucho et al 2020 crone et al 2016 anmbr technology is thus a clear candidate for renewing the wastewater treatment approach and would contribute to the economic environmental and social goals of water management with ce playing an active role persevering with a business as usual scenario based on conventional technologies which have been shown to be effective but not efficient would entail ignoring the current global context climate change energy transition resource depletion and environment degradation this work describes the results of operating of an anmbr semi industrial plant demonstration scale trl of 6 for mww treatment at the alcázar de san juan wwtp alcázar de san juan ciudad real spain the size of the prototype together with being fed with real mww and operated for more than 2 5 years means it can be considered a reliable and robust source of performance data the main objective of the study was to contrast anmbr with conventional wastewater treatments and demonstrate its potential benefits 2 materials and methods 2 1 anmbr description and operation fig 1 shows the process and instrumentation diagram p id of the semi industrial anmbr plant operated in this work this plant mainly consists of a 40 m3 c a 34 4 m3 working volume 5 6 m3 headspace anaerobic reactor connected to three 0 8 m3 membrane tanks c a 0 7 m3 working volume 0 1

screw rt 1 5 mm screen size an equalization tank 1 1 m3 and a clean in place tank 0 37 m3 were the other main elements in the plant total sludge volume was recorded considering the working volumes of both the anaerobic reactor and membrane tanks accounting for 36 32 1 63 m3 during the operating period the anmbr was equipped with a 2 1 m2 degassing membrane unit for dissolved methane recovery consisting of a polydimethylsiloxane pdms hollow fiber commercial module provided by permselect medarray inc usa the plant was fed with effluent from the pre treatment step sand and grease removal of the alcázar de san juan wwtp alcázar de san juan ciudad real spain further details of this anmbr system can be found in robles et al 2020 regarding filtration process the system was able to operate with transmembrane flux in the range 14 21 lmh with moderate sparging gas demand 11 14 nm3 biogas m 3 permeate and significant total suspended solids tss 8 13 g l 1 transmembrane pressures varied between 87 and 490 mbar and fouling rates between 1 7 and 16 6 mbar d 1 only two chemical cleanings of membrane were needed during the considered experimental period the semi industrial plant performance was assessed from two points of view i considering the 610 days of operations included in this work and ii selecting 5 periods from the overall operating period it is important to highlight the variable influent quality and the relatively high cod and bod concentrations due to the contributions of several nearby dairy and wine industries during the operation period and based on data obtained in previous anmbr pilot plant studies giménez et al 2014 2012 seco et al 2018 srt was maintained at 70 days and the plant was operated at two different hrt 25 26 and 41 hours temperature varied freely between 10 and 27 c ambient temperature operation while olr was in the range between 0 60 0 20 and 1 28 0 38 kg cod m 3 d 1 table 1 shows the characterization of the influent and effluent streams together with the main operating conditions during the five selected periods 2 2 anmbr monitoring the following parameters were regularly monitored in the influent total cod and bod5 sulfate so 4 2 s sulfide hs s total nitrogen nt total phosphorus pt nitrate no3 n phosphate po4 3 p tss and volatile suspended solids vss effluent characterization comprised total cod nt pt and hs s and volatile fatty acids vfa finally reactor monitoring was based on tss vss cod ph temperature and methane content in the biogas ch4 dissolved methane in the effluent was calculated by henry s law and assuming saturation conditions ph temperature and biogas flow rate were registered online 24 hour composite samples were taken from the influent twice a week for all measurements except for cod which was analyzed daily grab samples were taken twice a week from the effluent and mixed liquor 2 3 analytical methods tss vss cod bod5 sulfate sulfide and nutrients were determined according to standard methods apha 2005 vfa concentration was determined by titration according to the method proposed by moosbrugger et al 1992 2 4 data processing and calculations different key performance indicators were calculated to evaluate the performance of the system as shown in robles et al 2020 i e methane yield taking into account the methane dissolved in the permeate cod removal rates and biosolids production 3 results and discussion the performance of the demonstration plant was evaluated for 610 days five periods were further characterized to assess the robustness of the anmbr technology against the disturbances in the main operating conditions derived from the natural variations throughout the year 3 1 organic removal efficiency fig 2 shows the 15 day moving average for the influent organic load along with its 95 confidence bands the daily average temperature and both the removed and biodegraded cod the influent organic load was highly variable mainly due to the aforementioned variable industrial discharges biodegraded cod accounted for the cod that was biologically removed by srb or was transformed into methane by ma whereas the removed cod also considered the physically retained cod by the ultrafiltration process besides the biodegraded cod conversely the influent sulfate concentration variation was moderate resulting in different cod so 4 2 s ratios for each period see table 1 the temperature followed the natural variations in mid latitude temperate climates with strong variations between day to night data not shown and summer to winter the daily average temperature difference from winter to summer was higher than 17 c the hrt was varied to simulate population shifts during summer and winter periods as a result of population density changes during vacation periods initially hrt was set to 41 hours in period p1 in accordance with the low population density in coastal areas before the summer hrt was almost halved from p1 to p2 25 1 h and p4 26 2 h to simulate the intensification of water usage by the massive influx of tourists in coastal areas during vacation periods similarly p3 y p5 were operated at the same low temperature 19 1 and 18 1 c respectively but different hrt 25 1 h in p3 and 41 13 h in p5 to simulate population variation during the winter period hrt was kept practically constant from period p2 to period p4 around 25 h representing densely populated all year long areas however as shown in table 1 the olr decreased 1 28 0 38 kg cod m 3 d 1 in p2 0 82 0 19 kg cod m 3 d 1 in p3 and 0 71 0 23 kg cod m 3 d 1 in p4 as a result of the drop in the influent cod concentrations 1403 532 mg l 1 in p2 896 201 mg l 1 in p3 and 755 224 mg l 1 in p4 which was attributed to changes in the activity of the industries that discharge into the sewer system the sulfate concentration also decreased from period p2 172 2 28 5 mg s l 1 to period p3 125 4 47 6 mg s l 1 albeit the cod reduction was more significant resulting in a lower cod so 4 2 s ratio conversely the sulfate concentration in period p4 157 3 46 9 mg s l 1 was higher than in period p3 despite the fact that cod concentration continued to fall both contributing to a significant reduction in the cod so 4 2 s ratio so 4 2 s concentration in period p5 149 7 26 9 mg s l 1 remaining similar to p4 the increased influent cod concentration in period p5 1038 238 mg l 1 thus resulted in a higher cod so 4 2 s ratio despite the higher cod concentration olr was lower in period p5 0 60 0 20 kg cod m 3 d 1 than in period p4 as a result of the higher hrt in period p5 fig 2 shows that cod removal accounted for an average of 87 2 6 1 of the influent cod 87 of the cod removal data was higher than 80 whilst almost 40 of the cod removal data was over 90 the membranes were able to virtually retain all particulates however the occasional unbalanced performance of the different stages in anaerobic degradation due to low temperatures or organic load peaks accumulated intermediate soluble organics that were able to pass through the membrane thus increasing the effluent cod and reducing cod removal cod was not completely biodegraded by srb or by ma conversely a fraction of the removed cod was simply retained within the system due to membrane filtration helping to increase the solids concentration and therefore waste sludge production regarding the biologically removed cod sulfate concentration was virtually zero in the effluent indicating that srb completely reduced influent sulfate 2 grams of cod were consumed per gram of so 4 2 s reduced the analysis of the variance anova of the cod consumed by srb expressed as olr srb i e the influent olr which is consumed by srb found a significant difference between the mean values in the different periods p value 0 0 see complementary material nevertheless fischer s least significant difference lsd method for the pairwise comparison of mean values in the different periods were fairly similar in the mean values for the olr srb among periods p1 and p5 and between periods p2 and p4 while p3 had an intermediate mean value the remaining cod was theoretically available for ma i e olr ma in the proportion shown in fig 3 as can be seen in this figure the olr in period p2 was much higher than the others as a result of the strengthened influent wastewater organic load during p2 24 5 of the olr was consumed by sbr olr sbr while 75 5 remained available for ma olr ma on the other hand p4 showed the lowest olr ma 58 3 the p value for the analysis of the variance of the olr ma see complementary material in each period was lower than 0 05 p value 0 0 again indicating a significant difference between the mean values in the different periods in this case fischer s lsd method found significant similarity between mean values of p1 and p3 and between p4 and p5 p2 had the highest mean value for olr available for ma due to the high treatment flow and influent cod concentration the system s response to organic load peaks entailed an accumulation of vfa likely due to the faster response of acid generating than acid consuming organisms although the system was able quickly restore the equilibrium the vfa effluent concentrations were low in the periods with longer hrt p1 and p5 and moderate organic overloads also higher operating temperatures were associated with lower vfa concentrations p1 p2 and p4 in contrast the combination of short hrt and lower temperature of p3 led to more severe organic overloading and hindered accumulated vfa consumption resulting in the highest vfa effluent concentrations see table 1 this result is attributed to the more severe impairment of acid consuming organisms which seemed to be more affected by lower temperatures than acid producing organisms 3 2 methane production table 2 shows the percentages of the cod removed by filtration and biodegradation and biodegraded cod as aforementioned the cod removed was higher in periods p1 93 1 6 3 and p5 92 5 3 5 when hrt was higher 41 1 and 41 13 h respectively indicating that the extended contact time between soluble organics and anaerobic microorganisms enabled ma to further consume the organic matter and produce ch4 and co2 the absence of intermediate products indicates that the intermediate anaerobic degradation steps were properly balanced hydrolysis and solubilization being the limiting steps the percentage of biodegraded cod in p1 and p2 was higher than the rest of the periods 71 3 27 7 and 74 4 14 5 respectively due to their high influent cod concentration 1285 429 mg cod l 1 in p1 and 1403 532 mg cod l 1 in p2 and temperature 27 1 c and 24 2 c respectively which favored bacterial metabolism and hence organic matter consumption p4 with 63 4 26 2 of biodegraded cod also presents a high operating temperature 27 1 c but also the lowest influent cod concentration 755 224 mg cod l 1 the percentage of biodegraded cod in p4 is similar to those obtained in p3 61 0 16 2 and p5 61 4 13 0 operated at low temperatures 18 2 c and 19 1 c respectively but with higher influent cod 896 201 mg cod l 1 in p3 and 1038 238 mg cod l 1 in p5 fig 4 depicts the time evolution of the 15 day moving average biogas production along with its 95 confidence bands as can be seen the biogas production trend was directly related to the fraction of cod load available for ma ol ma although it was also influenced by temperature which limited the production of substrates for srb and ma as a result of the reduction in the hydrolysis and solubilization rates the capacity of the system to recover energy was evaluated in terms of methane yield y c h 4 which stands for the amount of methane produced per unit of influent cod the biomethane potential bmp representing the fraction of the influent cod that ended up as methane by comparing y c h 4 to the theoretical maximal methane production i e 350 stp l ch4 kg 1 cod was also calculated the resulting y c h 4 and bmp in the different periods are shown in table 2 however only the results regarding y c h 4 will be discussed since the bmp results followed the same trend the highest y c h 4 value was obtained in p1 169 0 95 1 stp l ch4 kg 1 cod with a combination of high t 27 1 οc and hrt 41 1 h its influent cod so 4 2 s ratio was also the most favorable for methane production 8 70 3 69 cod g 1 so 4 2 s while a high temperature enhanced the hydrolysis rate which is considered the limiting stage in anaerobic digestion methane production increased with the cod available for ma for which p1 had the highest percentage of influent cod available for ma 77 0 see fig 3 in contrast the slight temperature drop and reduced hrt reduction between periods p1 and p2 24 2 οc and 25 1 h respectively helped to reduce the y c h 4 to 109 6 70 0 stp l ch4 kg 1 cod even when fischer s lsd method showed that the amount of cod for ma in p2 was the highest 35 kg d 1 it is important to highlight that an error of 18 5 was obtained when cod mass balance was applied to p2 see fig 5 and discussed in section 3 5 this cod loss could be attributed to underestimated biogas production as mentioned above dissolved methane in the effluent was calculated assuming saturation conditions although there could have been oversaturation episodes pauss et al 1990 p3 and p4 present the lowest y c h 4 values 75 2 16 9 and 70 2 36 0 stp l ch4 kg 1 cod respectively these results can also be explained by the temperature hrt and cod so 4 2 s ratio despite p3 being operated with a moderate influent cod so 4 2 s ratio 7 14 4 31 g cod g 1 so 4 2 s and available organic matter 72 0 influent cod could not offset its low operating temperature 19 1 c and hrt 26 2 h which hindered hydrolysis and possibly also methane production in p4 the operating temperature was favorable 27 1 c and hrt remained at 26 2 h but the cod so 4 2 s ratio was significantly lower than in the other periods 4 80 2 86 g cod g 1 so 4 2 s which justifies the lower y c h 4 finally similar y c h 4 values were obtained for p2 and p5 109 6 70 0 and 102 3 63 8 stp l ch4 kg 1 cod respectively in this case p2 had high temperature 24 2 c and high cod so 4 2 s ratio 8 15 4 44 g cod g 1 so 4 2 s but lower hrt 25 1 h p5 operated at high hrt 41 13 h a moderate influent cod so 4 2 s ratio 6 94 2 83 g cod g 1 so 4 2 s but the lowest temperature 18 2 c considering that influent quality cannot be modified hrt thus becomes the main design parameter for maximizing methane production in low winter temperatures it should be remembered that influent sulfate concentration depends on the region in which the wastewater is generated since it is associated with the concentration of sulfate in water sources as well as the possible contribution of factories that discharge sulfur to the sewage system since the cod consumed by srb is biodegradable and should have undergone at least the first stages of anaerobic degradation i e hydrolysis and solubilization to be available for srb it would also have been available for ma a sulfate free influent would thus have yielded a much higher y c h 4 and bmp would have been similar to the percentage of biodegraded cod as way of example methane yields without considering the cod consumed by srb in the studied periods y s o 4 c h 4 would rise to 87 4 191 0 stp l ch4 kg 1 cod however in sulphate rich wastewater the role of srb in reducing the effluent soluble cod when hrt is reduced must be considered since srb has higher degradation rates than ma especially at lower temperatures 3 3 biosolids the waste sludge production wsp expressed in kg vss per kg of influent cod and per kg of removed cod is shown in table 2 the reported values are the outcome of a complex interaction between operational conditions and influent characteristics the fraction and composition of particulates in the influent and their fate within the system which depends on the operating conditions temperature hrt and especially srt influence the accumulation and retention of biosolids and therefore increased wsp a greater influx of solids into the system entails greater accumulation and retention unless the operating conditions favor hydrolysis and solubilization on the other hand hydrolysis is widely accepted as the limiting step in anaerobic degradation and is severely affected by temperature drops batstone 2006 although temperature also affects the following steps of the anaerobic degradation results indicated that intermediates accumulation can be mitigated as long as hrt is high enough in the same way wsp can also be reduced by increasing system srt thus extending the time for further hydrolysis and solubilization of the accumulated solids as can be seen in table 2 p3 had the highest wsp 0 166 0 074 kg vss kg 1 codrem mainly due to the low temperature 19 1 c the operating conditions hindered biodegradability and therefore raised sludge production p4 and p5 also had high wsp 0 150 0 079 kg vss kg 1 codrem and 0 148 0 072 kg vss kg 1 codrem respectively although lower than p1 the high production in p5 can be attributed to the lowest operating temperature 18 2 c however despite temperature in p4 being the highest 27 1 c the significant wsp in this period was associated with its low cod so 4 2 s 4 80 2 86 g cod g 1 so 4 2 s in this period the percentage of influent cod consumed by srb accounted for 41 7 while in the other periods was below 29 since the srb biomass yield was significantly higher than ma the associated solids production was also higher as was sludge production in this period durán et al 2020 finally p1 and p2 had the lowest wsp 0 121 0 067 and 0 103 0 044 kg vss kg 1 codrem respectively both were operated at high temperature 27 1 c in p1 and 24 2 c in p2 and had the highest cod so 4 2 s ratio 8 70 3 69 g cod g 1 so 4 2 s and 8 15 4 44 g cod g 1 so 4 2 s respectively the combination of both variables enhanced ma organic matter biodegradation and reduced sludge production p2 was also characterized by the highest percentage of influent vss cod and bod5 indicating the highest influent wastewater biodegradability and that the operating conditions were appropriate for the maximum biosolids degradation it is important to highlight that besides the complex interaction of factors that affect the wsp it can be as low as 0 103 0 044 kg vss kg 1 codrem as a way of comparison foladori et al 2015 reported 0 23 0 35 kg vss kg 1 codrem srt of around 10 20 days and 0 18 kg vss kg 1 codrem for aerobic treatment without and with sludge stabilization respectively according to these values all the selected periods had lower wsp than the aerobic treatments with percentage reductions between 8 p3 and 43 p2 increasing srt over 70 days could be expected to lead to lower wsp and additional biosolids stabilization although solids concentration in the reactor would also rise and affect processes such as membrane filtration in the operating stage or increase reactor capacities requirements in the design stage in this regard ji et al 2020 obtained a wsp of 0 09 kg vss kg 1 codrem operating two different anmbr with different pore size membranes for 120 days at 25οc in this work no excess sludge was wasted during long term operations except for the sludge samples this value confirms that it is possible to achieve low wsp with high srts on the other hand with the same technology seco et al 2018 reported a wsp of 0 218 kg vss kg 1 codrem with an srt of 140 days and 27οc design and operating conditions thus need to be carefully selected taking influent characteristics into account and especially the particulate cod and cod so 4 2 s ratio 3 4 nutrients recovery potential anaerobic treatments have low nutrients requirements per cod removed as can be seen from the effluent characterization shown in table 1 which confirms that anmbr is promising technology for turning wastewater into a source of nutrients nt and pt concentrations in the effluent accounted for 37 0 54 0 mgn l 1 and 6 3 9 9 mgp l 1 respectively considering the treatment capacity of alcázar de san juan wwtp 16000 m3 d 1 these concentrations represent 216 315 t n year 1 and 37 58 t p year 1 it should be noted that over 90 of european phosphorus applications are import dependent so that wastewater can play an active role as a p supplier by combining anmbr and ce fundamentals rosemarin et al 2020 selecting urea co nh2 2 and p2o5 as representative n based and p based fertilizers respectively nutrients equivalent to 463 676 t urea year 1 and 84 132 t p2o5 year 1 could be provided by effluent if a price of 273 6 per t of urea bib31 and 783 0 per t of p2o5 bib30 is assumed the mineral fertilizer equivalent value of the nutrients in the discharge flow would be between k 162 and k 230 per year and would pay for 10 15 of water treatment costs at 0 269 per m3 for anmbr jiménez benítez et al 2020a to reduce production costs and impact an alternative embedded nutrient strategy consists of direct reuse fertigation instead of producing fertilizers from effluent which makes anmbr technology especially suitable for decentralized plants in rural areas where the effluent can be discharged directly to farmland it is important to highlight that apart from a nutrient rich stream the combination of an anaerobic process with uf membrane implemented in an anmbr produces an effluent free of solids and pathogens krzeminski et al 2017 which makes it especially appropriate for fertigation for example alcázar de san juan wwtp could cover an annual winter wheat crop productivity 6 7 t grain ha 1 of 1080 1575 ha attending to n needs 0 2 t ha 1 and 1527 2400 ha if p2o5 requirements are considered 0 055 t ha 1 roy et al 2006 3 5 cod mass balance and overall performance considerations fig 5 shows the cod mass balance in the periods studied each sector of the circles depicts the fraction of the influent cod i e cod biodegraded by srb cod associated with biogas cod from dissolved methane cod wasted with sludge cod in the effluent and mass balance error p1 shows no mass balance error but periods p2 to p5 have positive values in all cases indicating that the influent cod is higher than cod leaving the system through biogas effluent wasted sludge and cod biodegraded by srb the errors in p4 1 7 and p5 3 3 are negligible while p2 and p3 show significant errors 18 5 and 11 6 respectively as all the parameters involved in cod mass balance e g flow rates cod concentration biogas production waste sludge etc are based on analytical and or on line measurements except for dissolved methane calculated as stated in section 2 2 it is hypothesized that in these two periods dissolved methane in the effluent have been underestimated as mentioned above dissolved methane is calculated considering saturation conditions based on henry s law although oversaturation could take place in these periods due to methane bubbles passing through the membranes or poor reactor mixing fig 5 confirms the influence of operating at high t hrt and cod so 4 2 s ratio to enhance methane production with p1 p2 and p5 showing the highest percentages of biogas associated to cod p1 operated at the highest temperature hrt and cod so 4 2 s ratio 27 1 c 41 1 h and 8 70 3 69 g cod g 1 so 4 2 s respectively shows a percentage of 43 5 of biogas associated cod the highest value p2 was operated at high temperature 24 2 c and a favorable cod so 4 2 s ratio 8 15 4 44 g cod g 1 s both conditions could offset the lower hrt 25 1 h and kept biogas production at significant percentages 26 5 if the cod mass balance error 18 5 is attributed to underestimated methane production the biogas percentage could rise to 45 as in p1 p5 also presented significant biogas production 22 2 this period operated at high hrt 41 1 h and moderate influent cod so 4 2 s ratio 6 94 2 83 g cod g 1 so 4 2 s but the lowest t 18 2 c which hindered methane production since a negligible error was obtained for this period potential increased biogas production due to underestimated dissolved methane cannot be considered the lowest percentages of cod associated with biogas were obtained in p3 13 6 and p4 11 6 p3 operated at a low temperature 19 1 c and hrt 26 2 h and therefore with low biogas production despite a favorable influent cod so 4 2 s ratio 7 14 4 31 g cod g 1 so 4 2 s similar to p5 however if mass balance error is considered 11 6 biogas associated cod could rise to 25 2 p4 with low hrt 26 2 h and the lowest influent cod so 4 2 s ratio 4 80 2 86 g cod g 1 so 4 2 s had the lowest cod percentage associated with methane production 11 6 despite its favorable operating temperature 27 1 c for the cod associated with waste sludge fig 5 shows that p5 had the highest percentage 31 1 this period operated at the lowest t 18 2 c which hindered particulate degradation and the lowest olr 0 60 0 20 kg cod m 3 d 1 since olr before p5 was higher than in this period see fig 2 the sludge wasted during p5 could have been influenced by accumulated vss p2 had a percentage of 17 2 due to its favorable operating temperature 24 2 c and the highest olr 1 28 0 38 kg cod m 3 d 1 p3 and p4 show a similar percentage associated with waste sludge 25 6 and 26 1 respectively despite operating at very different temperatures 19 1 c in p3 and 27 1 in p4 c this can be attributed to the higher cod percentage consumed by srb 41 7 in p4 as these bacteria have a higher growth yield than ma and therefore increase solids production in the reactor the results show an overall promising performance of anmbr technology for treating mww at ambient temperature the cod removal capacity allows compliance with treatment regulation e g mwwtd methane yields indicate its potential for organic matter valorization and energy recovery and nutrient content in the effluent indicates its capacity for turning wastewater into a valuable source of nutrients low waste sludge production means anmbr can be considered a robust candidate as the new core technology to boost the transition of wastewater treatment plants towards the new resource recovery facilities especially suitable for small and decentralized plants in which anaerobic processes are not currently applied temperature hrt srt and cod so 4 2 s ratio are crucial parameters to improve technological economic and environmental performance of anmbr technology for wastewater treatment hrt and srt being the only ones which do not depend on ambient conditions both hrt and srt thus appear as the main design parameter it is important to highlight the benefits that the implementation and optimization of dissolved methane recovery technologies e g hollow fiber membranes can provide to anmbr dissolved methane will improve the wastewater treatment energy balances while the carbon footprint associated with greenhouse gas emissions is minimized 4 conclusions an industrial anmbr prototype was operated for 610 days during which an average of 87 2 6 1 of influent cod removal was achieved with 87 of the data over 80 and almost 40 over 90 uf membranes contributed to wastewater treatment by retaining almost all the particulates in addition in the long term operations 5 periods were selected to evaluate the performance of the anmbr in these periods a y c h 4 between 70 2 and 169 0 stp l ch4 kg 1 cod were achieved and methane percentages in the biogas varied from 75 to 77 sludge production ranged between 0 103 0 044 and 0 166 0 074 kg vss kg 1 codrem which represents a reduction of 9 to 43 compared to cas a significant nutrient recovery potential was also identified finally temperature hrt and cod so 4 2 s ratio jointly with srt are crucial parameters to take into account in maximizing anmbr s technical economic and environmental performance however since temperature and influent cod so 4 2 s depend on ambient conditions hrt could be considered the main design parameter jointly with srt declaration of competing interest none acknowledgement the authors are grateful to the european commission for the co financing of the life memory project life13 env es 001353 and the staff of
