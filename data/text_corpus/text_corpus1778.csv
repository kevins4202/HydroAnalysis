8890,although unconventional water can be applied as an alternative for agricultural production inappropriate irrigation water quality may adversely affect the soil crop system thus field experiments under mulched drip irrigation were performed over three years 2017 2019 to investigate the impacts of three salinity 1 2 and 3 g l 1 with five na ca molar ratios 1 3 5 7 and 9 of irrigation water on tomato plant growth fruit development soil salt accumulation and soil sodium adsorption ratio the results showed that with irrigation water salinity of 1 g l 1 the critical value of irrigation water na ca molar ratio for the high yield and dry matter accumulation was 3 and 5 respectively while the threshold for high concentration of vitamin c and lycopene was 7 with the irrigation water salinity of 2 g l 1 and 3 g l 1 the na ca molar ratio threshold for a high concentration of soluble solids vitamin c and lycopene was 5 moreover considering the increase of plant nitrogen and phosphorus accumulation the decrease of sodium adsorption ratio at 40 100 cm soil layer inside the film and the diminution of soil salt accumulation at 0 100 cm layer irrigation water with higher salinity and lower na ca molar ratio was more proper than that with lower salinity and higher na ca molar ratio based on the multi objective optimization with entropy weight topsis method irrigation water with a salinity level at 2 g l 1 and the na ca molar ratio at 5 was suggested for tomato planting in the yinbei yellow river irrigation district china keywords mulched drip irrigation plant growth fruit development sodium adsorption ratio soil salinization data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in arid and semi arid regions which are characterized by little precipitation high evaporation and an uneven spatial temporal distribution of water resources the water demand for agricultural production is typically met by supplementary irrigation ierna and mauromicale 2018 uddameri et al 2020 due to the increase in population and the rapid expansion of industries and agriculture ma et al 2020 severe shortage of fresh water is a threat to the sustainability of agricultural production in order to ensure a steady of grain oil cotton sugar and vegetables it is vital to use unconventional water resources in place of fresh water for farmland irrigation xue and ren 2017 as an example of unconventional water resources jalali et al 2017 brackish water has been used to replace fresh water in agricultural irrigation for hundreds of years stewart and hirst 1916 khaleghi et al 2020 sekhon et al 2020 although saline water irrigation is a double edged sword hussain et al 2015 alharby et al 2018 on the one hand the requirement of water and some trace elements can be partially supplied with saline water irrigation for the vegetative and reproductive growth of crops moreover studies have indicated that moderate salt stress is conducive to the enhancement of osmotic regulation ability stimulation of crop root development regulation of plants aboveground growth liu et al 2013 hussain et al 2015 increase in fruit nutrient concentration li et al 2019a 2019b and improvement of the fruit or grain quality samui et al 2020 li et al 2022a 2022b on the other hand brackish water irrigation usually results in the rise of soil osmotic pressure in the root zone she et al 2018 the impediment of root water uptake and has adverse effects on plant physiological activities such as photosynthesis and respiration ashraf and foolad 2007 shimul et al 2014 baath et al 2017 rodriguez ortega et al 2019 these ultimately lead to the decrease of dry matter accumulation yang et al 2019 zhang et al 2022 reduction of seed setting rate cuartero and fernandez munoz 1999 and decline of crop yield moreover the salt ions induced by saline water irrigation tend to accumulate in the root region which decreases soil microorganisms and results in the retardation of soil nutrients she et al 2018 in addition to having significant effects on the soil crop system irrigation water s salt ions composition also has a noticeable impact on the soil s physical chemical and biological traits as well as the performance of the crop in terms of vegetative growth reproductive growth yield and quality campos et al 2006 on the one hand the adsorption capacity of k na and cl to soil colloids is weak and the ability of the ions to migrate with water is strong due to the fact that both the k na and cl are characterized with small hydration and low ionic charge meanwhile the ca2 mg2 and so4 2 usually have strong adsorption capacity to soil colloids and weak ability to move with water accordingly the na and k in the soil are easily exchanged with the ca2 and mg2 in the irrigation water during the soil moisture infiltration after saline water irrigation lv et al 2000 li et al 2003 which not only affects the dissociative ions concentration and composition in the soil but also exhibits significant influence on the spatial distribution of soil soluble salt besides the na accumulation generally results in the expansion and dispersion of soil particles as well as the decline of soil permeability li et al 2003 on the other hand the effects of irrigation water salt composition on crops are mainly reflected in the selective absorption of soil moisture and salt ions by roots which usually result in osmotic stress ion toxicity na so4 2 cl and nutritional unbalance in the plant tissues flores et al 2016 zhu 2016 that may affect the plant related physiological activities studies have revealed that the elevated concentration of na in the soil usually corresponds to the high osmotic pressure in cells low concentration of chlorophyll the low utilization efficiency of carbon dioxide co2 manai et al 2014 low activity of the photosynthesis related enzyme weak photosynthesis and reduction of crop yield while the k absorbed by plants usually plays a critical role in the osmotic pressure regulation of plant tissues the proportion of k concentration to na concentration and the ratio of ca2 concentration to na concentration generally act as important evaluation indexes for the plant tolerance to soil salt stress zhu 2016 van zelm et al 2020 moreover blossom end rot ber the main factor that usually results in the reduction of fruit setting rate is considered to be induced by fruit ca2 deficiency mestre et al 2012 zhai et al 2015 thus estimating the suitability of irrigation water salinity and salt composition for unconventional water secure and efficient utilization during agricultural production in arid and semi arid regions is essential tomato solanum lycopersicum l a popular healthy fruit is rich in nutrients and antioxidants e g lycopene β carotene dietary fiber and is widely planted in the yinbei yellow river irrigation district of ningxia china according to previous research tomato belongs to the moderately salt sensitive crop cantore et al 2008 malash et al 2008 and can be irrigated with brackish water in fresh water deficit areas according to maas and hoffman 1977 the critical value for the considerable reduction of tomato yield is the electric conductivity of soil saturation paste extract at 2 5 ds m 1 liu et al 2013 implied that the irrigation water salinity threshold for a tomato at the flowering and fruit enlargement stages were 3 g l 1 and 5 g l 1 respectively zhai et al 2015 have proposed that the critical value of irrigation water salinity for the distinct incidence of ber was 3 4 ds m 1 additionally the fruit setting rate and single fruit weight of tomato tend to decrease with the rising salinity of irrigation water the tomato yield and peel hardness tend to decrease subsequently while the accumulation of soluble solids ss organic acids and soluble sugars may increase guo et al 2013 although several experimental studies have been conducted in the field or greenhouse to investigate the effects of irrigation water salinity and saline water irrigation schedule on tomato yield fruit quality dynamics of soil water concentration and soil salinity limited researches have focused on the salt ions composition of irrigation water it has been hypothesized that the influence of various salt ion compositions on crop growth and soil environment is inconsistent even with the same irrigation water salinity moreover irrigation water with high salinity and proper salt ion compositions may be more suitable for soil crop system than irrigation water with low salinity therefore field experiments were conducted with mulched drip irrigation technology over a three year period in the yinbei yellow river irrigation district of the ningxia hui autonomous region china to evaluate the hypothesis and provide a theoretical basis for the rational utilization of brackish water the main objectives of this study were 1 to explore the effects of three irrigation water salinities 1 2 3 g l 1 and five na ca molar ratios 1 3 5 7 9 on tomato dry matter accumulation main nutrient elements accumulation in plants and fruit development performance 2 to investigate the response of soil sodium adsorption ratio sar soluble salt accumulation and available nutrients accumulation to increasing levels of salinity and na ca molar ratio of irrigation water during tomato growth period 3 to optimize the proper combination of irrigation water salinity and na ca molar ratio for multiple goals about plant vigorous growth high production good quality

practices li et al 2018 wang et al 2018 li et al 2022a 2022b according to the study of kang and wan 2005 the rootzone soil matric potential measured by the vacuum gauge tensiometer was used to trigger

according to fig 4 the irrigation depth for s1r1 s1r2 and s1r3 treatments obtained the maximum value 420 mm 440 mm and 400 mm in 2017 2018 and 2019 respectively while the irrigation amount for s3r5 treatment attained the minimum 180 mm in 2017 and 2019 200 mm in 2018 with the irrigation water salinity of 1 g l 1 there was no dramatic difference in irrigation amount among s1r1 s1r2 and s1r3 treatments with irrigation water salinity of 3 g l 1 when the na ca molar ratio exceeded 1 the irrigation depth declined notably with the rising na ca molar ratio of irrigation water additionally with the same irrigation water salinity there was no distinct difference in irrigation depth for treatments when the irrigation water na ca molar ratio was 1 and 3 while a remarkable difference in irrigation depth was observed for the treatments with irrigation water na ca molar ratio at 7 and 9 before mulching the raised beds the base fertilizer potassium sulphate 45 k2so4 and diammonium

salinity and na ca molar ratio on the accumulation of dry matter and plant nutrients 3 1 1 dry matter accumulation in tomato plant tissues plant dry matter accumulation is the material basis for the yield formation of crops thus the dry matter of plant tissues roots stem leaves and fruits for treatments at the end of the tomato harvesting stage was analyzed in 2017 2018 and 2019 fig 5 as shown in fig 5 the dry matter of tomato plant for treatments ranged from 6 44 103 kg ha 1 to 8 36 103 kg ha 1 and the s3r5 treatment obtained the minimum value in 2017 2018 and 2019 the plant dry matter mainly accumulated in fruits especially the fruit dry matter accounts for 62 92 69 76 of the whole plant dry matter considering the plant dry matter accumulation in roots stem and leaves the s2r2 treatment got the maximum value there was no significant influence of irrigation water na ca molar ratio on plant dry matter accumulation with the same irrigation water salinity with an irrigation water salinity of 1 g l 1 or 2 g l 1 the plant dry matter initially increased and then decreased with the increasing irrigation water na ca molar ratio with irrigation water salinity of 3 g l 1 the plant dry matter decreased with the increasing na ca molar ratio of irrigation water 3 1 2 the nutrients accumulation in tomato plant tissues nitrogen phosphorus and potassium are the main nutrient elements for plant growth and development which are mainly obtained by plants from the soil via roots the amount of plant nutrients accumulated in the tissues roots stems leaves fruits during the tomato growth period in 2017 2018 and 2019 were evaluated and is shown in fig 6 according to fig 6 the plant nitrogen phosphorus and potassium accumulation varied from 91 85 to 150 81 kg ha 1 27 47 kg ha 1 and 187 324 kg ha 1 respectively s1r3 or s1r4 treatment got the highest amount of plant nitrogen accumulation among treatments the s1r4 and s1r1 treatments achieved the maximum accumulation amounts of phosphorus and potassium respectively while the s3r5 treatment got the minimum accumulation of nitrogen phosphorus and potassium at the same irrigation water salinity level no significant difference in phosphorus accumulation was observed among the treatments the potassium accumulation amount also had no notable difference among treatments once the na ca molar ratio exceeded 3 when the irrigation water salinity was 1 g l 1 or 2 g l 1 the accumulation amount of nitrogen and phosphorus in the roots stems and leaves increased initially and then declined with the rise of irrigation water na ca molar ratio while the nitrogen and phosphorus accumulation amount in fruits reduced with the increasing irrigation water na ca molar ratio with the irrigation water salinity of 3 g l 1 the accumulation of phosphorus nitrogen and potassium in the plant tissues decreased with the increased na ca molar ratio of irrigation water furthermore when the irrigation water na ca molar ratios exceeded 5 nitrogen and phosphorus accumulation reduced with the rising irrigation water salinity in addition the amount of nitrogen accumulation for s2r1 and s2r2 treatments were significantly greater than the values for s2r4 and s2r5 treatments similarly the nitrogen accumulation amount for s3r1 treatment significantly greater than that for s3r4 and s3r5 treatments similarly the accumulation amount of nitrogen and phosphorus for s3r1 and s2r1 treatments were greater than the values for s2r5 and s4r5 treatments respectively taking the irrigation water salinity and na ca molar ratio as the primary influencing factors the two way analysis of variance on the accumulation of dry matter nitrogen phosphorus and potassium for plants were conducted and the results are shown in table s1 both the irrigation water salinity and na ca molar ratio have notable influence on the accumulation amount of plant nitrogen and potassium while the interaction of the two factors showed no significant influence on the accumulation amount of dry matter phosphorus and potassium 3 2 the effects of irrigation water salinity and na ca molar ratio on the performance of tomato fruit development 3 2 1 tomato yield as presented in fig 7 the s1r1 treatment reached the maximum value of marketable yield 11 21 104 kg ha 1 in 2017 and 2018 11 26 104 kg ha 1 in 2019 while the s3r5 treatment got the minimum marketable yield and total yield which were 3 168 104 kg ha 1 and 4 19 104 kg ha 1 respectively moreover the s1r4 and s3r4 treatments reached the maximum and minimum wue of 21 98 kg m 3 and 12 82 kg m 3 respectively both the marketable yield and total yield decreased with increasing na ca molar ratio of irrigation water especially the marketable yield and total yield reduced dramatically when the irrigation water na ca molar ratios exceeded 5 additionally when the irrigation water salinity was 3 g l 1 the tomato yield for s3r4 and s3r5 treatments were notably less than the production for s1r1 s1r2 and s1r3 treatments 3 2 2 fruit quality in general various abiotic stresses such as soil water deficit and soil salinization can affect tomato nutritional quality and fruit flavor quality yang et al 2019 as the important characteristics of tomato quality the ti and the concentrations of ss vc and lycopene were measured in this study and are shown in figs 8 and 9 according to the significant levels of treatments effects on tomato ti table s2 both the irrigation water salinity na ca molar ratio and the interaction of irrigation water salinity and na ca molar ratio had no distinct influence on the tomato ti p 0 05 although there were no dramatical effects of irrigation water salinity on tomato lycopene concentration the irrigation water salinity had extremely notable impacts on the fruit vc concentration p 0 01 moreover there were highly significant effects of irrigation water na ca molar ratio on the concentration of vc ss and lycopene p 0 01 the interaction of the two influencing factors also had highly significant impacts on the concentration of fruit ss and vc p 0 01 statistical analysis showed that the tomato ti ranged from 0 94 to 1 14 and that the s2r3 and s2r5 treatments obtained the maximum ti which was 1 13 in 2017 1 14 in 2018 and 2019 fig 8 when the irrigation water salinity was 2 g l 1 or 3 g l 1 the tomato ss concentration initially increased then declined with the rising na ca molar ratio of irrigation water at the same irrigation water salinity the concentration of vc and lycopene firstly increased and then continuously decreased with the increasing irrigation water na ca molar ratio however the tomato obtained the maximum lycopene concentration when the irrigation water na ca molar ratio was 7 when the irrigation water na ca molar ratio was below 5 the tomato vc concentration showed an initial increase followed by a decreasing trend with the increase in salinity of irrigation water however the fruit lycopene concentration increased continuously 3 3 the impacts of irrigation water salinity and na ca molar ratio on the soil sar after tomato harvest the sar at 0 40 cm soil layer for treatments ranged from 7 61 mmolc l 1 1 2 to 10 96 mmolc l 1 1 2 while the sar at 40 100 cm soil layer was in the range of 5 41 7 73 mmolc l 1 1 2 the soil sar at 0 40 cm soil layer for s3r4 and s3r5 treatments exceeded 10 mmolc l 1 1 2 while the sar at 0 40 cm soil layer outside the film for s3r3 treatment was higher than 10 mmolc l 1 1 2 in 2018 and 2019 fig 10 moreover the s3r5 treatment achieved the maximum sar at 40 100 cm soil layer inside the plastic film while the s1r1 treatment achieved the peak value of the sar at 40 100 cm soil layer outside the mulch particularly the soil sar at the surface 40 cm layer outside the mulch was greater than that at 40 100 cm outside the plastic film and the gap between the two layers increased with the increasing salinity and na ca molar ratio of irrigation water with the irrigation water salinity of 1 g l 1 the sar at 0 40 cm soil layer has no significant difference among treatments similarly no significant difference was observed for sar at 40 100 cm soil layer outside the mulch when the irrigation water salinity was 3 g l 1 the sar at 0 40 cm layer inside the plastic film increased with the increase in na ca molar ratio of irrigation water particularly the sar at 0 40 cm soil layer inside the mulch was greater than the sar at 40 100 cm soil layer inside the film and sar at 0 40 cm soil layer outside the mulch this result is consistent with the study of su ying 2006 with lower irrigation water salinity 1 g l 1 or 2 g l 1 the sar at 0 40 cm soil layer inside the mulch was lower than that at 0 40 cm outside the mulch and 40 100 cm soil layer inside the plastic film moreover in terms of the sar at 40 100 cm soil layer the value inside the mulch was greater than that outside the plastic film especially sar at 40 100 cm soil layer inside the mulch increased with the rising salinity and na ca molar ratio of irrigation water even though not significantly interestingly the sar at 40 100 cm soil layer inside the plastic mulch for s2r1 and s3r1 treatments were dramatically lower than that for s1r5 and s2r5 treatments respectively the significant effects of different treatments on soil sar after tomato harvest are shown in table s3 both the salinity and na ca molar ratio of irrigation water had significant effects on the sar at 0 40 cm soil layer as well as sar at 40 100 cm soil layer inside the plastic mulch additionally the interaction effect of irrigation water salinity and na ca molar ratio significantly affected the sar at 0 40 cm soil layer 3 4 the response of soil salt accumulation to the salinity and na ca molar ratio of irrigation water the soil salt accumulation amounts at 0 40 cm and 40 100 cm soil layers for treatments during the tomato growth period are presented in fig 11 although salt accumulated in 0 100 cm soil layer for all treatments there was a notable difference of accumulation amount at the two sampling locations even within the same soil layer the amount of soil salt accumulation in surface 40 cm inside the plastic film was less than that in 0 40 cm outside the plastic mulch conversely the amount of soil salt accumulation in 40 100 cm inside the mulch was higher than that in the 40 100 cm layer outside the film with the same irrigation water salinity the soil salt accumulation amount in the 0 100 cm layer inside the plastic film increased significantly with the increasing salinity and na ca molar ratio of irrigation water similarly the amount of soil salt accumulation in the 0 100 cm layer outside the mulch increased with the increasing na ca molar ratio of irrigation water even though there was no significant difference among treatments as shown in fig 11 soil salt accumulated in 40 100 cm layer for all treatments and the amount of accumulation ranged from 6 838 103 kg ha 1 to 17 548 103 kg ha 1 whereas the soil salt for s1r1 s1r2 s1r3 and s2r1 treatments desalinized in 0 40 cm layer inside the plastic film while the amount of demineralization varied from 47 kg ha 1 to 813 kg ha 1 also soil salt in 0 40 cm layer outside the plastic mulch accumulated and the amount of soil salt accumulation was in the range of 10 564 103 kg ha 1 to 13 277 103 kg ha 1 although the demineralization amount of soil salt in a 40 100 cm layer outside the plastic mulch for s1r2 and s2r1 treatments ranged from 159 to 861 kg ha 1 interestingly with respect to the soil salt accumulation in the 0 100 cm layer the accumulation amount for s1r5 treatment inside and outside the plastic film was higher than that for s2r1 and s2r2 treatments similarly the accumulation amount of soil salt for s2r5 treatment was higher than that for s3r1 and s3r2 treatments 3 5 the accumulation of soil available nutrients with different irrigation water salinity and na ca molar ratio the accumulation amounts of soil available nutrients during the tomato growing period are demonstrated in fig 12 available nitrogen available phosphorus and available potassium for treatments accumulated in 0 100 cm soil layer and the accumulation amounts varied within 242 366 kg ha 1 138 201 kg ha 1 and 1461 2358 kg ha 1 respectively moreover s1r1 and s3r5 treatments had the minimum and maximum amounts of soil available nutrients accumulation respectively obviously with the same irrigation water salinity the accumulation amount of soil available nutrients in 0 100 cm increased with the na ca molar ratio of irrigation water particularly the accumulation of soil available nitrogen at 0 100 cm layer was in accord with the tendency of soil available nitrogen accumulation in the surface 40 cm the accumulation amount of soil available nitrogen in 40 100 cm was higher than that in 0 40 cm however the amount of soil available phosphorus accumulation on the surface of 40 cm was higher than that in the 40 100 cm layer moreover with the same irrigation water salinity no dramatic difference in the accumulation amount of soil available nitrogen among treatments was observed additionally when the na ca molar ratio of irrigation water was 1 or 3 the amount of soil available nitrogen accumulation in the 0 100 cm layer increased dramatically with the rising salinity of irrigation water the significant levels for the effects of irrigation water salinity the na ca molar ratio and the interaction of the two influencing factors on the accumulation amount of soil available nitrogen phosphorus and potassium are shown in table s4 the irrigation water salinity na ca molar ratio and the interaction of the two factors showed significant influences on the accumulation amount of soil available potassium in 0 40 cm and 40 100 cm although the irrigation water salinity significantly influenced the accumulation of available nitrogen and phosphorus at 0 100 cm soil layer the irrigation water na ca molar ratio exhibited no significant influence on the available nitrogen accumulation amount at 0 40 cm soil layer moreover the interaction of the two influencing factors had extremely significant impacts on the amount of soil available phosphorus accumulation and soil available potassium accumulation at 0 40 cm layer 3 6 multi objective evaluation based on entropy weight topsis it was hard to determine the consistent appropriate irrigation water quality separately with multiple targets in the present study thus the entropy weight topsis method was employed to evaluate the favorable irrigation water in this study the dry matter is an important index to measure the organic matter accumulation in plants the high marketable yield is the goal that pursued by farmers while the wue and nue are the core contents of efficient utilization of water and fertilizer moreover good quality of fruits is the demand of customers soil secondary salinization prevention is the focus of agricultural production with brackish water irrigation in arid and semi arid areas compared with the nutrient use efficiency both farmers and researchers have paid less attention to the soil nutrients accumulation thus the soil available nutrient accumulation was not considered in the analysis of the present study comprehensively the dry matter x1 marketable yield x2 wue x3 nue x4 pue x5 kue x6 ti x7 ss concentration x8 vc concentration x9 lycopene concentration x10 soil sar x11 and soil salt accumulation x12 for treatments were constructed into the original matrix the results of the overall evaluation are shown in table 6 the s2r3 treatment ranked first in 2017 second in 2018 and third in 2019 while the s1r3 treatment ranked fifth in 2017 first in 2018 and second in 2019 the s1r4 treatment ranked fourth in 2017 third in 2018 and first in 2019 although some differences in the orders were found among the three years the difference was minimal the suitable combination was obtained with the irrigation water salinity of 2 g l 1 and na ca molar ratio at 5 while the most unfavorable combination was attained with the irrigation water salinity of 3 g l 1 and na ca molar ratio at 9 moreover the water with a salinity of 3 g l 1 was not conducive to obtaining the comprehensive optimality as well the irrigation water na ca molar ratio of 9 was unfavorable to acquiring the comprehensive benefits 4 discussion 4 1 response of tomato plant growth development to irrigation water salinity and na ca molar ratio saline water irrigation is a double edged sword on the one hand brackish water irrigation is favorable for improving plant osmotic adjustment ability which stimulates plant growth on the other hand saline water irrigation may result in salt stress and ion toxicity on plant growth which adversely affect plant physiological and biochemical functions the present experiment found that the accumulation of dry matter plant nitrogen plant phosphorus and plant potassium was significantly affected by irrigation water salinity which was in line with the research of chen et al 2010 this may be attributed to the sensibility of root water uptake and plant dry matter accumulation to salt stress the irrigation water salinity exerted detrimental impacts on the plant metabolic processes such as transpiration and photosynthesis zhai et al 2015 she et al 2018 the variation of tomato plant dry matter accumulation is consistent with the conclusions of yurtseven et al 2005 who revealed that the tomato plant biomass showed a decreasing tendency with the rising salinity of irrigation water since plant tissues roots shoot leaves et al development was restrained by the salt stress kamrani et al 2013 ding et al 2019 moreover the irrigation water na ca molar ratio had a highly significant influence on the accumulation amount of plant nitrogen and potassium p 0 01 which agrees with the research results presented by machekposhti et al 2017 at the irrigation water salinity of 1 g l 1 the accumulation amount of dry matter nitrogen and phosphorus increased first and then decreased with the increase of irrigation water na ca molar ratio which attained the peak value when the na ca molar ratio arrived 5 at the irrigation water salinity of 3 g l 1 both the accumulation amount of dry matter nitrogen phosphorus and potassium decreased with the increasing na ca molar ratio of irrigation water this may be due to the fact that na is one of the main ions that induce ion toxicity in tomato plant li et al 2019a 2019b rodriguez ortega et al 2019 accordingly with the same irrigation water salinity the absorption capacity of plants for some essential ions k ca2 and nutrients nitrogen phosphorus may be reduced with the increasing na concentration in the soil solution hauser and horie 2010 parihar et al 2015 though studies have noted that the plants usually have a higher absorption selectivity for potassium over sodium hu and schmidhalter 2005 moreover the s1r1 treatment got the maximum amount of plant potassium accumulation which is consistent with the maximum value of irrigation depth and tomato yield in addition the amount of plant nitrogen and phosphorus accumulation for s2r1 treatment was greater than the value for s1r5 treatment and the value for s3r1 treatment was greater than that for s2r5 treatment this indicate that irrigation water with higher salinity and lower na ca molar ratio is more conducive to the accumulation of plant nitrogen and phosphorus than the irrigation water with lower salinity and higher na ca molar ratio considering the performance of dry matter plant nitrogen plant phosphorus and plant potassium the irrigation water salinity and na ca molar ratio corresponding to s1r3 or s1r4 or s2r2 treatment is recommended for the accumulation of dry matter and nutrients in tomato plants 4 2 response of tomato fruit development to irrigation water salinity and na ca molar ratio generally the detrimental effects of salt stress induced by brackish water irrigation on tomato yield include a decrease in average fruit weight yang et al 2019 a decline in flowers number adams and ho 1989 magan et al 2008 and the reduction of fruit setting rate cuartero et al 2006 during the reproductive growth stage of tomato katerji et al 1998 however with the salt stress induced by irrigation water salinity both the increasing incidence of ber and the decreasing phosphorus and potassium accumulation can reduce tomato yield feleafel and el araby 2003 magan et al 2008 existing studies show that with moderate irrigation water salinity the reduction of tomato yield mainly results from the decrease of fruit average weight whereas with a high salinity of irrigation water the reduction of fruit number and the decrease of average fruit weight together result in the tomato yield reduction ehret et al 2013 the tomato yield total yield and marketable yield in the present study decreased with the rising salinity and na ca molar ratio of irrigation water especially when the na ca molar ratio exceeded 5 which was coherent with the study of magan et al 2008 as the research has indicated that tomato production reduced distinctly with increasing salinity of irrigation water which may be related to the decline in fruit number and the decrease in average fruit weight as shown in table 7 the ratio of marketable yield to total yield rmt for treatments varied from 0 697 to 0 998 while the rmt for s3r4 and s3r5 treatments was lower than 0 75 the s1r3 and s3r4 treatments obtained the maximum and minimum rmt in 2017 and 2018 respectively while the s1r4 and s3r5 treatments attained the maximum 0 996 and minimum 0 719 values of rmt in 2019 respectively though rmt only has little difference among treatments with the irrigation water salinity of 1 g l 1 or 2 g l 1 the rmt declined with the rising irrigation water na ca molar ratio particularly the rmt for treatments with elevated salinity 3 g l 1 and high na ca molar ratios 7 and 9 declined by 28 compared with 1 the results of rmt were coherent with the studies of wan et al 2011 as they recognized that irrigation water with high salinity and elevated na concentration increased the incidence of ber shao et al 2013 also indicated that tomato yield tended to reduce due to the increasing incidence of ber which was induced by the calcium deficit with high soil salinity moreover with the same irrigation water salinity the decreasing rate for crop water consumption and total yield with the increasing na ca molar ratio was different this may be attributed to the fact that the mulched drip irrigation was triggered by the vacuum tensiometer which was buried 20 cm below the soil surface even with the same irrigation water salinity the different na ca molar ratios of irrigation water may have resulted in the difference of matrix potential and osmotic potential accordingly both the irrigation schedule and crop water consumption were different among treatments tomato quality includes flavor quality and nutrition quality which are usually affected by the interaction of environmental factors agronomic elements and genetic factors dorais et al 2001 the tomato flavor quality mainly includes the concentration of reducing sugar and organic acid ascorbic acid while the nutritional quality comprises the concentration of ss vc and lycopene the salt stress induced by brackish water irrigation generally results in a decrease in fruit water concentration ben ahmed et al 2009 li et al 2019a 2019b and increased concentration of reducing sugar total sugar organic acid ss and vc in tomato fruits van de wal et al 2017 li et al 2022a 2022b there were strong significant influences of irrigation water salinity na ca molar ratio and their interaction on tomato ss and vc concentrations the results of this study about the impacts of irrigation water salinity on the concentration of ss vc and lycopene were in coherent with the previous research zhang et al 2019 li et al 2022a 2022b which revealed that with the same irrigation water salinity the raising na ca molar ratio of irrigation water was favorable to the synthesis of tomato ss vc and lycopene particularly the critical na ca molar ratio value of irrigation water in this study was 5 that may be due to the fact that the concentrations of vc ss and lycopene increased to a certain extent result from the decrease of fruit water concentration which was induced by abiotic stress to attenuate the harmful osmotic effects of salt by osmotic adjustment velterop and vos 2001 verslues et al 2006 additionally with the increasing irrigation water na ca molar ratio the tomato ti increased initially and then decreased when the irrigation water salinity was 1 g l 1 this was similar to the research of li et al 2019a 2019b the study performed by li et al 2019a 2019b has confirmed that the sugar acid ratio increased quadratically with the rising salinity of irrigation water due to the inconsistent increase rate of reducing sugar concentration and organic acid concentration to obtain the desired tomato fruit production irrigation water salinity and na ca molar ratio corresponding to s1r1 treatment was more preferable while the irrigation water salinity and na ca molar ratio corresponds to s2r3 treatment was more appropriate for the improve of tomato ti ss concentration and vc concentration since there was no significant difference between the tomato marketable yield and the total yield for s1r1 and s2r3 treatments the irrigation water with a salinity of 2 g l 1 and na ca molar ratio at 3 or 5 was suggested during the tomato growth period for high yield and good quality 4 3 response of soil salinization and alkalization to irrigation water salinity and na ca molar ratio the soil salt ions movement is generally accompanied by a series of complex dynamic processes which include the participation of physical chemical and biological factors such as soil salt spatial variability precipitation irrigation fertilization surface evaporation and root water uptake li et al 2019a 2019b sar is one of the important indexes to evaluate the soil salinization degree zheng et al 2010 the elevated sar generally corresponds to a high concentration of exchangeable sodium weak capacity for ph buffering saifullah et al 2018 clay dispersion lakhdar et al 2009 severely destroyed structure of soil and low activity of soil microbials lakhdar et al 2009 with lower irrigation water salinity 1 g l 1 there were no distinct impacts of irrigation water na ca molar ratio on sar at 0 100 cm soil layer outside the plastic film while with irrigation water salinity of 3 g l 1 the soil sar at 0 40 cm soil layer inside the film increased with the rising irrigation water na ca molar ratio these results differ from the previous studies ayers and westcot 1985 uccc 1974 as the previous research have shown that the risks of soil degradation by sodium are greater with the lower salts concentration in the irrigation water moreover the variation of topsoil 0 40 cm sar with rising na ca molar ratio of irrigation water was is in agreement with the research of su ying 2006 and shao et al 2015 according to su ying 2006 the topsoil sar increased with increasing irrigation water sar the findings may be attributed to the weak adsorption capacity of soil colloids to na as well as the large amounts of dissolved sodium ions induced by irrigation water with a higher na ca molar ratio furthermore the sar at 40 100 cm soil layer inside the plastic film for s2r1 and s3r1 treatments was lower than the sar for s1r5 and s2r5 treatments respectively the results indicated that the irrigation water with higher salinity and lower na ca molar ratio was more conducive to retarding the rise of soil sar inside the plastic film compared with the irrigation water with lower salinity and higher na ca molar ratio the soil salt accumulation amount in 0 100 cm inside the mulch increased with the increasing irrigation water salinity and na ca molar ratio this result is consistent with the research conclusions from li et al 2019a 2019b and yang et al 2019 and can be attributed to the induction effect of saline water irrigation on soil salt accumulation with the increase of irrigation water salinity and na ca molar ratio the concentration of electrolyte and monovalent cation increased the soil permeability decreased tedeschi and dell aquilar 2005 and the corresponding soil saturated hydraulic conductivity decreased hu et al 2018 huang et al 2019 zhou et al 2021 with the influence of irrigation leaching film mulching topsoil evaporation and soil water infiltration the surface soil sar and the amount of soil salt accumulation at 0 40 cm layer inside the mulch was lower than the value outside the plastic film while the soil sar and the soil salt accumulation amount in 40 100 cm layer inside the mulch were higher than the values outside the film this may be because the suppression of the topsoil evaporation and the inhibition of soil salt accumulated toward the topsoil resulted from the polyethylene mulching huang et al 2016 zhang et al 2017a 2017b previous studies indicate that the appropriate increase of irrigation water salt content was favorable to the amelioration of surface soil an increase of soil effective porosity and improvement of soil permeability to a certain extent li et al 2022a 2022b liao et al 2021 particularly shi et al 2005 recognized that the soil infiltration ability achieved the maximum rate when the irrigation water salinity was 3 g l 1 the irrigation water salinity showed distinct effects on the accumulation of available nitrogen phosphorus and potassium at 0 100 cm soil layer with the same irrigation water salinity the accumulation of available nitrogen phosphorus and potassium at 0 100 cm soil layer increased with the rising na ca molar ratio of irrigation water these results were in accordance with the research of feleafel and mirdad 2014 and tian et al 2018 as they found a certain increase of soil available nutrients during the growth period of greenhouse tomato with saline water irrigation this result may be attributed to the fact that the background values of soil nutrients and the amount of fertilization for treatments were consistent in the experiments while the amount of water and nutrient extraction decreased with the increasing irrigation water na ca molar ratio benderradji et al 2011 hussain et al 2015 lacerda et al 2016 lacerda et al 2018 especially the irrigation water with high salinity furthermore the rise of irrigation water salinity and na ca molar ratio resulted in a decrease in irrigation depth and soil permeability accordingly the leaching amount of soil available nutrients declined to alleviate the exchangeable sodium ions accumulation in the surface soil reduce the soil sar and diminish the soil salt accumulation the irrigation water with salinity of 1 g l 1 and na ca molar ratio at 1 was recommended for the cultivation of tomato in the experimental area additionally due to the fact that the soil salt ions accumulated through the 0 100 cm with the designed drip irrigation patterns during the tomato growth period effective measures flood irrigation with sufficient freshwater during the non growth period application of chemical amendment or organic fertilizer straw incorporation should be considered to maintain the sustainable and ecological development for tomato production 4 4 multi objective evaluation the entropy weight method was used to determine the target weight in this study the topsis method was used for multi objective evaluation and the goals include plant vigorous growth tomato high yield fruit good quality and soil salination prevention from the results the irrigation water with a salinity of 2 g l 1 3 21 ds m 1 and na ca molar ratio of 5 is recommended for tomato cultivation in the experimental area although irrigation water with a salinity of 1 g l 1 and na ca molar ratio of 5 or 7 was more appropriate for plant biomass accumulation and nutrient uptake the biomass accumulation for s2r3 treatment only reduced by 2 73 and 2 96 than that for s1r3 and s1r4 treatments respectively however compared with the fruit ti and vc concentrations for s1r3 and s1r4 treatments the tomato ti for s2r3 treatment increased by 2 7 and 5 56 while the vc concentration for s2r3 treatment increased by 8 1 and 3 8 respectively the irrigation water with a salinity of 1 g l 1 and na ca molar ratio at 1 is more appropriate for soil salinization prevention however the tomato ti ss vc and lycopene concentrations for s1r1 treatment were 12 9 17 9 21 7 and 11 3 lower than that for s2r3 treatment respectively this may be due to the fact that a proper increase of irrigation water salinity and na ca molar ratio results in the decrease of fruit water content to improve the osmotic adjustment ability ben ahmed et al 2009 meanwhile the concentration of reductive sugar ss vc and lycopene increased van de wal et al 2017 li et al 2022a 2022b according to the results of the multi objective evaluation the s2r3 treatment ranked after s1r3 treatment in 2018 and 2019 the s2r3 treatment ranked first and the s1r3 ranked fifth in 2017 importantly the s2r3 treatment ranked more stable than s1r3 treatment in 2017 2019 synthetically the irrigation water corresponding to s2r3 treatment was more proper for tomato cultivation with the designed irrigation pattern in the yinbei yellow river irrigation district china 5 conclusion with mulched drip irrigation for tomato with low salinity 1 g l 1 of irrigation water the increase of na ca molar ratio contributed to the accumulation of plant dry matter and nutrients boost of tomato yield and amelioration of fruit quality the critical value of irrigation water na ca molar ratio for dry matter accumulation plant nitrogen accumulation and plant phosphorus accumulation was 5 while the threshold for marketable yield and total yield was 3 and the critical value for the concentration of vc and lycopene was 7 moreover the fruit ss concentration soil sar in 0 40 cm soil salt accumulation in 0 100 cm and soil available nitrogen accumulation in 0 40 cm increased with the increasing irrigation water na ca molar ratio with the irrigation water salinity at 2 g l 1 or 3 g l 1 the moderate increase of irrigation water na ca molar ratio was conducive to the improvement of tomato quality the critical value for the concentration of ss vc and lycopene was 5 with the same salinity of irrigation water the sar at 0 40 cm soil layer and soil salt accumulation amount in 0 100 cm increased with the increasing na ca molar ratio furthermore the irrigation water with higher salinity and lower na ca molar ratio was more favourable than that with lower salinity and higher na ca molar ratio to increase the plant nitrogen and phosphorus accumulation decrease the soil salt accumulation amount in 0 100 cm soil layer based on the entropy weight topsis analysis with multiple goals plant vigorous growth tomato high yield fruit good quality soil saline alkali prevention the irrigation water with salinity of 2 g l 1 and na ca molar ratio at 5 was suggested for tomato production in the yinbei yellow river irrigation district china a major limitation of the present study is that the variation of ions in plant tissues was not considered

8890,although unconventional water can be applied as an alternative for agricultural production inappropriate irrigation water quality may adversely affect the soil crop system thus field experiments under mulched drip irrigation were performed over three years 2017 2019 to investigate the impacts of three salinity 1 2 and 3 g l 1 with five na ca molar ratios 1 3 5 7 and 9 of irrigation water on tomato plant growth fruit development soil salt accumulation and soil sodium adsorption ratio the results showed that with irrigation water salinity of 1 g l 1 the critical value of irrigation water na ca molar ratio for the high yield and dry matter accumulation was 3 and 5 respectively while the threshold for high concentration of vitamin c and lycopene was 7 with the irrigation water salinity of 2 g l 1 and 3 g l 1 the na ca molar ratio threshold for a high concentration of soluble solids vitamin c and lycopene was 5 moreover considering the increase of plant nitrogen and phosphorus accumulation the decrease of sodium adsorption ratio at 40 100 cm soil layer inside the film and the diminution of soil salt accumulation at 0 100 cm layer irrigation water with higher salinity and lower na ca molar ratio was more proper than that with lower salinity and higher na ca molar ratio based on the multi objective optimization with entropy weight topsis method irrigation water with a salinity level at 2 g l 1 and the na ca molar ratio at 5 was suggested for tomato planting in the yinbei yellow river irrigation district china keywords mulched drip irrigation plant growth fruit development sodium adsorption ratio soil salinization data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in arid and semi arid regions which are characterized by little precipitation high evaporation and an uneven spatial temporal distribution of water resources the water demand for agricultural production is typically met by supplementary irrigation ierna and mauromicale 2018 uddameri et al 2020 due to the increase in population and the rapid expansion of industries and agriculture ma et al 2020 severe shortage of fresh water is a threat to the sustainability of agricultural production in order to ensure a steady of grain oil cotton sugar and vegetables it is vital to use unconventional water resources in place of fresh water for farmland irrigation xue and ren 2017 as an example of unconventional water resources jalali et al 2017 brackish water has been used to replace fresh water in agricultural irrigation for hundreds of years stewart and hirst 1916 khaleghi et al 2020 sekhon et al 2020 although saline water irrigation is a double edged sword hussain et al 2015 alharby et al 2018 on the one hand the requirement of water and some trace elements can be partially supplied with saline water irrigation for the vegetative and reproductive growth of crops moreover studies have indicated that moderate salt stress is conducive to the enhancement of osmotic regulation ability stimulation of crop root development regulation of plants aboveground growth liu et al 2013 hussain et al 2015 increase in fruit nutrient concentration li et al 2019a 2019b and improvement of the fruit or grain quality samui et al 2020 li et al 2022a 2022b on the other hand brackish water irrigation usually results in the rise of soil osmotic pressure in the root zone she et al 2018 the impediment of root water uptake and has adverse effects on plant physiological activities such as photosynthesis and respiration ashraf and foolad 2007 shimul et al 2014 baath et al 2017 rodriguez ortega et al 2019 these ultimately lead to the decrease of dry matter accumulation yang et al 2019 zhang et al 2022 reduction of seed setting rate cuartero and fernandez munoz 1999 and decline of crop yield moreover the salt ions induced by saline water irrigation tend to accumulate in the root region which decreases soil microorganisms and results in the retardation of soil nutrients she et al 2018 in addition to having significant effects on the soil crop system irrigation water s salt ions composition also has a noticeable impact on the soil s physical chemical and biological traits as well as the performance of the crop in terms of vegetative growth reproductive growth yield and quality campos et al 2006 on the one hand the adsorption capacity of k na and cl to soil colloids is weak and the ability of the ions to migrate with water is strong due to the fact that both the k na and cl are characterized with small hydration and low ionic charge meanwhile the ca2 mg2 and so4 2 usually have strong adsorption capacity to soil colloids and weak ability to move with water accordingly the na and k in the soil are easily exchanged with the ca2 and mg2 in the irrigation water during the soil moisture infiltration after saline water irrigation lv et al 2000 li et al 2003 which not only affects the dissociative ions concentration and composition in the soil but also exhibits significant influence on the spatial distribution of soil soluble salt besides the na accumulation generally results in the expansion and dispersion of soil particles as well as the decline of soil permeability li et al 2003 on the other hand the effects of irrigation water salt composition on crops are mainly reflected in the selective absorption of soil moisture and salt ions by roots which usually result in osmotic stress ion toxicity na so4 2 cl and nutritional unbalance in the plant tissues flores et al 2016 zhu 2016 that may affect the plant related physiological activities studies have revealed that the elevated concentration of na in the soil usually corresponds to the high osmotic pressure in cells low concentration of chlorophyll the low utilization efficiency of carbon dioxide co2 manai et al 2014 low activity of the photosynthesis related enzyme weak photosynthesis and reduction of crop yield while the k absorbed by plants usually plays a critical role in the osmotic pressure regulation of plant tissues the proportion of k concentration to na concentration and the ratio of ca2 concentration to na concentration generally act as important evaluation indexes for the plant tolerance to soil salt stress zhu 2016 van zelm et al 2020 moreover blossom end rot ber the main factor that usually results in the reduction of fruit setting rate is considered to be induced by fruit ca2 deficiency mestre et al 2012 zhai et al 2015 thus estimating the suitability of irrigation water salinity and salt composition for unconventional water secure and efficient utilization during agricultural production in arid and semi arid regions is essential tomato solanum lycopersicum l a popular healthy fruit is rich in nutrients and antioxidants e g lycopene β carotene dietary fiber and is widely planted in the yinbei yellow river irrigation district of ningxia china according to previous research tomato belongs to the moderately salt sensitive crop cantore et al 2008 malash et al 2008 and can be irrigated with brackish water in fresh water deficit areas according to maas and hoffman 1977 the critical value for the considerable reduction of tomato yield is the electric conductivity of soil saturation paste extract at 2 5 ds m 1 liu et al 2013 implied that the irrigation water salinity threshold for a tomato at the flowering and fruit enlargement stages were 3 g l 1 and 5 g l 1 respectively zhai et al 2015 have proposed that the critical value of irrigation water salinity for the distinct incidence of ber was 3 4 ds m 1 additionally the fruit setting rate and single fruit weight of tomato tend to decrease with the rising salinity of irrigation water the tomato yield and peel hardness tend to decrease subsequently while the accumulation of soluble solids ss organic acids and soluble sugars may increase guo et al 2013 although several experimental studies have been conducted in the field or greenhouse to investigate the effects of irrigation water salinity and saline water irrigation schedule on tomato yield fruit quality dynamics of soil water concentration and soil salinity limited researches have focused on the salt ions composition of irrigation water it has been hypothesized that the influence of various salt ion compositions on crop growth and soil environment is inconsistent even with the same irrigation water salinity moreover irrigation water with high salinity and proper salt ion compositions may be more suitable for soil crop system than irrigation water with low salinity therefore field experiments were conducted with mulched drip irrigation technology over a three year period in the yinbei yellow river irrigation district of the ningxia hui autonomous region china to evaluate the hypothesis and provide a theoretical basis for the rational utilization of brackish water the main objectives of this study were 1 to explore the effects of three irrigation water salinities 1 2 3 g l 1 and five na ca molar ratios 1 3 5 7 9 on tomato dry matter accumulation main nutrient elements accumulation in plants and fruit development performance 2

salinity and na ca molar ratio on the accumulation of dry matter and plant nutrients 3 1 1 dry matter accumulation in tomato plant tissues plant dry matter accumulation is the material basis for the yield formation of crops thus the dry matter of plant tissues roots stem leaves and fruits for treatments at the end of the tomato harvesting stage was analyzed in 2017 2018 and 2019 fig 5 as shown in fig 5 the dry matter of tomato plant for treatments ranged from 6 44 103 kg ha 1 to 8 36 103 kg ha 1 and the s3r5 treatment obtained the minimum value in 2017 2018 and 2019 the plant dry matter mainly accumulated in fruits especially the fruit dry matter accounts for 62 92 69 76 of the whole plant dry matter considering the plant dry matter accumulation in roots stem and leaves the s2r2 treatment got the maximum value there was no significant influence of irrigation water na ca molar ratio on plant dry matter accumulation with the same irrigation water salinity with an irrigation water salinity of 1 g l 1 or 2 g l 1 the plant dry matter initially increased and then decreased with the increasing irrigation water na ca molar ratio with irrigation water salinity of 3 g l 1 the plant dry matter decreased with the increasing na ca molar ratio of irrigation water 3 1 2 the nutrients accumulation in tomato plant tissues nitrogen phosphorus and potassium are the main nutrient elements for plant growth and development which are mainly obtained by plants from the soil via roots the amount of plant nutrients accumulated in the tissues roots stems leaves fruits during the tomato growth period in 2017 2018 and 2019 were evaluated and is shown in fig 6 according to fig 6 the plant nitrogen phosphorus and potassium accumulation varied from 91 85 to 150 81 kg ha 1 27 47 kg ha 1 and 187 324 kg ha 1 respectively s1r3 or s1r4 treatment got the highest amount of plant nitrogen accumulation among treatments the s1r4 and s1r1 treatments achieved the maximum accumulation amounts of phosphorus and potassium respectively while the s3r5 treatment got the minimum accumulation of nitrogen phosphorus and potassium at the same irrigation water salinity level no significant difference in phosphorus accumulation was observed among the treatments the potassium accumulation amount also had no notable difference among treatments once the na ca molar ratio exceeded 3 when the irrigation water salinity was 1 g l 1 or 2 g l 1 the accumulation amount of nitrogen and phosphorus in the roots stems and leaves increased initially and then declined with the rise of irrigation water na ca molar ratio while the nitrogen and phosphorus accumulation amount in fruits reduced with the increasing irrigation water na ca molar ratio with the irrigation water salinity of 3 g l 1 the accumulation of phosphorus nitrogen and potassium in the plant tissues decreased with the increased na ca molar ratio of irrigation water furthermore when the irrigation water na ca molar ratios exceeded 5 nitrogen and phosphorus accumulation reduced with the rising irrigation water salinity in addition the amount of nitrogen accumulation for s2r1 and s2r2 treatments were significantly greater than the values for s2r4 and s2r5 treatments similarly the nitrogen accumulation amount for s3r1 treatment significantly greater than that for s3r4 and s3r5 treatments similarly the accumulation amount of nitrogen and phosphorus for s3r1 and s2r1 treatments were greater than the values for s2r5 and s4r5 treatments respectively taking the irrigation water salinity and na ca molar ratio as the primary influencing factors the two way analysis of variance on the accumulation of dry matter nitrogen phosphorus and potassium for plants were conducted and the results are shown in table s1 both the irrigation water salinity and na ca molar ratio have notable influence on the accumulation amount of plant nitrogen and potassium while the interaction of the two factors showed no significant influence on the accumulation amount of dry matter phosphorus and potassium 3 2 the effects of irrigation water salinity and na ca molar ratio on the performance of tomato fruit development 3 2 1 tomato yield as presented in fig 7 the s1r1 treatment reached the maximum value of marketable yield 11 21 104 kg ha 1 in 2017 and 2018 11 26 104 kg ha 1 in 2019 while the s3r5 treatment got the minimum marketable yield and total yield which were 3 168 104 kg ha 1 and 4 19 104 kg ha 1 respectively moreover the s1r4 and s3r4 treatments reached the maximum and minimum wue of 21 98 kg m 3 and 12 82 kg m 3 respectively both the marketable yield and total yield decreased with increasing na ca molar ratio of irrigation water especially the marketable yield and total yield reduced dramatically when the irrigation water na ca molar ratios exceeded 5 additionally when the irrigation water salinity was 3 g l 1 the tomato yield for s3r4 and s3r5 treatments were notably less than the production for s1r1 s1r2 and s1r3 treatments 3 2 2 fruit quality in general various abiotic stresses such as soil water deficit and soil salinization can affect tomato nutritional quality and fruit flavor quality yang et al 2019 as the important characteristics of tomato quality the ti and the concentrations of ss vc and lycopene were measured in this study and are shown in figs 8 and 9 according to the significant levels of treatments effects on tomato ti table s2 both the irrigation water salinity na ca molar ratio and the interaction of irrigation water salinity and na ca molar ratio had no distinct influence on the tomato ti p 0 05 although there were no dramatical effects of irrigation water salinity on tomato lycopene concentration the irrigation water salinity had extremely notable impacts on the fruit vc concentration p 0 01 moreover there were highly significant effects of irrigation water na ca molar ratio on the concentration of vc ss and lycopene p 0 01 the interaction of the two influencing factors also had highly significant impacts on the concentration of fruit ss and vc p 0 01 statistical analysis showed that the tomato ti ranged from 0 94 to 1 14 and that the s2r3 and s2r5 treatments obtained the maximum ti which was 1 13 in 2017 1 14 in 2018 and 2019 fig 8 when the irrigation water salinity was 2 g l 1 or 3 g l 1 the tomato ss concentration initially increased then declined with the rising na ca molar ratio of irrigation water at the same irrigation water salinity the concentration of vc and lycopene firstly increased and then continuously decreased with the increasing irrigation water na ca molar ratio however the tomato obtained the maximum lycopene concentration when the irrigation water na ca molar ratio was 7 when the irrigation water na ca molar ratio was below 5 the tomato vc concentration showed an initial increase followed by a decreasing trend with the increase in salinity of irrigation water however the fruit lycopene concentration increased continuously 3 3 the impacts of irrigation water salinity and na ca molar ratio on the soil sar after tomato harvest the sar at 0 40 cm soil layer for treatments ranged from 7 61 mmolc l 1 1 2 to 10 96 mmolc l 1 1 2 while the sar at 40 100 cm soil layer was in the range of 5 41 7 73 mmolc l 1 1 2 the soil sar at 0 40 cm soil layer for s3r4 and s3r5 treatments exceeded 10 mmolc l 1 1 2 while the sar at 0 40 cm soil layer outside the film for s3r3 treatment was higher than 10 mmolc l 1 1 2 in 2018 and 2019 fig 10 moreover the s3r5 treatment achieved the maximum sar at 40 100 cm soil layer inside the plastic film while the s1r1 treatment achieved the peak value of the sar at 40 100 cm soil layer outside the mulch particularly the soil sar at the surface 40 cm layer outside the mulch was greater than that at 40 100 cm outside the plastic film and the gap between the two layers increased with the increasing salinity and na ca molar ratio of irrigation water with the irrigation water salinity of 1 g l 1 the sar at 0 40 cm soil layer has no significant difference among treatments similarly no significant difference was observed for sar at 40 100 cm soil layer outside the mulch when the irrigation water salinity was 3 g l 1 the sar at 0 40 cm layer inside the plastic film increased with the increase in na ca molar ratio of irrigation water particularly the sar at 0 40 cm soil layer inside the mulch was greater than the sar at 40 100 cm soil layer inside the film and sar at 0 40 cm soil layer outside the mulch this result is consistent with the study of su ying 2006 with lower irrigation water salinity 1 g l 1 or 2 g l 1 the sar at 0 40 cm soil layer inside the mulch was lower than that at 0 40 cm outside the mulch and 40 100 cm soil layer inside the plastic film moreover in terms of the sar at 40 100 cm soil layer the value inside the mulch was greater than that outside the plastic film especially sar at 40 100 cm soil layer inside the mulch increased with the rising salinity and na ca molar ratio of irrigation water even though not significantly interestingly the sar at 40 100 cm soil layer inside the plastic mulch for s2r1 and s3r1 treatments were dramatically lower than that for s1r5 and s2r5 treatments respectively the significant effects of different treatments on soil sar after tomato harvest are shown in table s3 both the salinity and na ca molar ratio of irrigation water had significant effects on the sar at 0 40 cm soil layer as well as sar at 40 100 cm soil layer inside the plastic mulch additionally the interaction effect of irrigation water salinity and na ca molar ratio significantly affected the sar at 0 40 cm soil layer 3 4 the response of soil salt accumulation to the salinity and na ca molar ratio of irrigation water the soil salt accumulation amounts at 0 40 cm and 40 100 cm soil layers for treatments during the tomato growth period are presented in fig 11 although salt accumulated in 0 100 cm soil layer for all treatments there was a notable difference of accumulation amount at the two sampling locations even within the same soil layer the amount of soil salt accumulation in surface 40 cm inside the plastic film was less than that in 0 40 cm outside the plastic mulch conversely the amount of soil salt accumulation in 40 100 cm inside the mulch was higher than that in the 40 100 cm layer outside the film with the same irrigation water salinity the soil salt accumulation amount in the 0 100 cm layer inside the plastic film increased significantly with the increasing salinity and na ca molar ratio of irrigation water similarly the amount of soil salt accumulation in the 0 100 cm layer outside the mulch increased with the increasing na ca molar ratio of irrigation water even though there was no significant difference among treatments as shown in fig 11 soil salt accumulated in 40 100 cm layer for all treatments and the amount of accumulation ranged from 6 838 103 kg ha 1 to 17 548 103 kg ha 1 whereas the soil salt for s1r1 s1r2 s1r3 and s2r1 treatments desalinized in 0 40 cm layer inside the plastic film while the amount of demineralization varied from 47 kg ha 1 to 813 kg ha 1 also soil salt in 0 40 cm layer outside the plastic mulch accumulated and the amount of soil salt accumulation was in the range of 10 564 103 kg ha 1 to 13 277 103 kg ha 1 although the demineralization amount of soil salt in a 40 100 cm layer outside the plastic mulch for s1r2 and s2r1 treatments ranged from 159 to 861 kg ha 1 interestingly with respect to the soil salt accumulation in the 0 100 cm layer the accumulation amount for s1r5 treatment inside and outside the plastic film was higher than that for s2r1 and s2r2 treatments similarly the accumulation amount of soil salt for s2r5 treatment was higher than that for s3r1 and s3r2 treatments 3 5 the accumulation of soil available nutrients with different irrigation water salinity and na ca molar ratio the accumulation amounts of soil available nutrients during the tomato growing period are demonstrated in fig 12 available nitrogen available phosphorus and available potassium for treatments accumulated in 0 100 cm soil layer and the accumulation amounts varied within 242 366 kg ha 1 138 201 kg ha 1 and 1461 2358 kg ha 1 respectively moreover s1r1 and s3r5 treatments had the minimum and maximum amounts of soil available nutrients accumulation respectively obviously with the same irrigation water salinity the accumulation amount of soil available nutrients in 0 100 cm increased with the na ca molar ratio of irrigation water particularly the accumulation of soil available nitrogen at 0 100 cm layer was in accord with the tendency of soil available nitrogen accumulation in the surface 40 cm the accumulation amount of soil available nitrogen in 40 100 cm was higher than that in 0 40 cm however the amount of soil available phosphorus accumulation on the surface of 40 cm was higher than that in the 40 100 cm layer moreover with the same irrigation water salinity no dramatic difference in the accumulation amount of soil available nitrogen among treatments was observed additionally when the na ca molar ratio of irrigation water was 1 or 3 the amount of soil available nitrogen accumulation in the 0 100 cm layer increased dramatically with the rising salinity of irrigation water the significant levels for the effects of irrigation water salinity the na ca molar ratio and the interaction of the two influencing factors on the accumulation amount of soil available nitrogen phosphorus and potassium are shown in table s4 the irrigation water salinity na ca molar ratio and the interaction of the two factors showed significant influences on the accumulation amount of soil available potassium in 0 40 cm and 40 100 cm although the irrigation water salinity significantly influenced the accumulation of available nitrogen and phosphorus at 0 100 cm soil layer the irrigation water na ca molar ratio exhibited no significant influence on the available nitrogen accumulation amount at 0 40 cm soil layer moreover the interaction of the two influencing factors had extremely significant impacts on the amount of soil available phosphorus accumulation and soil available potassium accumulation at 0 40 cm layer 3 6 multi objective evaluation based on entropy weight topsis it was hard to determine the consistent appropriate irrigation water quality separately with multiple targets in the present study thus the entropy weight topsis method was employed to evaluate the favorable irrigation water in this study the dry matter is an important index to measure the organic matter accumulation in plants the high marketable yield is the goal that pursued by farmers while the wue and nue are the core contents of efficient utilization of water and fertilizer moreover good quality of fruits is the demand of customers soil secondary salinization prevention is the focus of agricultural production with brackish water irrigation in arid and semi arid areas compared with the nutrient use efficiency both farmers and researchers have paid less attention to the soil nutrients accumulation thus the soil available nutrient accumulation was not considered in the analysis of the present study comprehensively the dry matter x1 marketable yield x2 wue x3 nue x4 pue x5 kue x6 ti x7 ss concentration x8 vc concentration x9 lycopene concentration x10 soil sar x11 and soil salt accumulation x12 for treatments were constructed into the original matrix the results of the overall evaluation are shown in table 6 the s2r3 treatment ranked first in 2017 second in 2018 and third in 2019 while the s1r3 treatment ranked fifth in 2017 first in 2018 and second in 2019 the s1r4 treatment ranked fourth in 2017 third in 2018 and first in 2019 although some differences in the orders were found among the three years the difference was minimal the suitable combination was obtained with the irrigation water salinity of 2 g l 1 and na ca molar ratio at 5 while the most unfavorable combination was attained with the irrigation water salinity of 3 g l 1 and na ca molar ratio at 9 moreover the water with a salinity of 3 g l 1 was not conducive to obtaining the comprehensive optimality as well the irrigation water na ca molar ratio of 9 was unfavorable to acquiring the comprehensive benefits 4 discussion 4 1 response of tomato plant growth development to irrigation water salinity and na ca molar ratio saline water irrigation is a double edged sword on the one hand brackish water irrigation is favorable for improving plant osmotic adjustment ability which stimulates plant growth on the other hand saline water irrigation may result in salt stress and ion toxicity on plant growth which adversely affect plant physiological and biochemical functions the present experiment found that the accumulation of dry matter plant nitrogen plant phosphorus and plant potassium was significantly affected by irrigation water salinity which was in line with the research of chen et al 2010 this may be attributed to the sensibility of root water uptake and plant dry matter accumulation to salt stress the irrigation water salinity exerted detrimental impacts on the plant metabolic processes such as transpiration and photosynthesis zhai et al 2015 she et al 2018 the variation of tomato plant dry matter accumulation is consistent with the conclusions of yurtseven et al 2005 who revealed that the tomato plant biomass showed a decreasing tendency with the rising salinity of irrigation water since plant tissues roots shoot leaves et al development was restrained by the salt stress kamrani et al 2013 ding et al 2019 moreover the irrigation water na ca molar ratio had a highly significant influence on the accumulation amount of plant nitrogen and potassium p 0 01 which agrees with the research results presented by machekposhti et al 2017 at the irrigation water salinity of 1 g l 1 the accumulation amount of dry matter nitrogen and phosphorus increased first and then decreased with the increase of irrigation water na ca molar ratio which attained the peak value when the na ca molar ratio arrived 5 at the irrigation water salinity of 3 g l 1 both the accumulation amount of dry matter nitrogen phosphorus and potassium decreased with the increasing na ca molar ratio of irrigation water this may be due to the fact that na is one of the main ions that induce ion toxicity in tomato plant li et al 2019a 2019b rodriguez ortega et al 2019 accordingly with the same irrigation water salinity the absorption capacity of plants for some essential ions k ca2 and nutrients nitrogen phosphorus may be reduced with the increasing na concentration in the soil solution hauser and horie 2010 parihar et al 2015 though studies have noted that the plants usually have a higher absorption selectivity for potassium over sodium hu and schmidhalter 2005 moreover the s1r1 treatment got the maximum amount of plant potassium accumulation which is consistent with the maximum value of irrigation depth and tomato yield in addition the amount of plant nitrogen and phosphorus accumulation for s2r1 treatment was greater than the value for s1r5 treatment and the value for s3r1 treatment was greater than that for s2r5 treatment this indicate that irrigation water with higher salinity and lower na ca molar ratio is more conducive to the accumulation of plant nitrogen and phosphorus than the irrigation water with lower salinity and higher na ca molar ratio considering the performance of dry matter plant nitrogen plant phosphorus and plant potassium the irrigation water salinity and na ca molar ratio corresponding to s1r3 or s1r4 or s2r2 treatment is recommended for the accumulation of dry matter and nutrients in tomato plants 4 2 response of tomato fruit development to irrigation water salinity and na ca molar ratio generally the detrimental effects of salt stress induced by brackish water irrigation on tomato yield include a decrease in average fruit weight yang et al 2019 a decline in flowers number adams and ho 1989 magan et al 2008 and the reduction of fruit setting rate cuartero et al 2006 during the reproductive growth stage of tomato katerji et al 1998 however with the salt stress induced by irrigation water salinity both the increasing incidence of ber and the decreasing phosphorus and potassium accumulation can reduce tomato yield feleafel and el araby 2003 magan et al 2008 existing studies show that with moderate irrigation water salinity the reduction of tomato yield mainly results from the decrease of fruit average weight whereas with a high salinity of irrigation water the reduction of fruit number and the decrease of average fruit weight together result in the tomato yield reduction ehret et al 2013 the tomato yield total yield and marketable yield in the present study decreased with the rising salinity and na ca molar ratio of irrigation water especially when the na ca molar ratio exceeded 5 which was coherent with the study of magan et al 2008 as the research has indicated that tomato production reduced distinctly with increasing salinity of irrigation water which may be related to the decline in fruit number and the decrease in average fruit weight as shown in table 7 the ratio of marketable yield to total yield rmt for treatments varied from 0 697 to 0 998 while the rmt for s3r4 and s3r5 treatments was lower than 0 75 the s1r3 and s3r4 treatments obtained the maximum and minimum rmt in 2017 and 2018 respectively while the s1r4 and s3r5 treatments attained the maximum 0 996 and minimum 0 719 values of rmt in 2019 respectively though rmt only has little difference among treatments with the irrigation water salinity of 1 g l 1 or 2 g l 1 the rmt declined with the rising irrigation water na ca molar ratio particularly the rmt for treatments with elevated salinity 3 g l 1 and high na ca molar ratios 7 and 9 declined by 28 compared with 1 the results of rmt were coherent with the studies of wan et al 2011 as they recognized that irrigation water with high salinity and elevated na concentration increased the incidence of ber shao et al 2013 also indicated that tomato yield tended to reduce due to the increasing incidence of ber which was induced by the calcium deficit with high soil salinity moreover with the same irrigation water salinity the decreasing rate for crop water consumption and total yield with the increasing na ca molar ratio was different this may be attributed to the fact that the mulched drip irrigation was triggered by the vacuum tensiometer which was buried 20 cm below the soil surface even with the same irrigation water salinity the different na ca molar ratios of irrigation water may have resulted in the difference of matrix potential and osmotic potential accordingly both the irrigation schedule and crop water consumption were different among treatments tomato quality includes flavor quality and nutrition quality which are usually affected by the interaction of environmental factors agronomic elements and genetic factors dorais et al 2001 the tomato flavor quality mainly includes the concentration of reducing sugar and organic acid ascorbic acid while the nutritional quality comprises the concentration of ss vc and lycopene the salt stress induced by brackish water irrigation generally results in a decrease in fruit water concentration ben ahmed et al 2009 li et al 2019a 2019b and increased concentration of reducing sugar total sugar organic acid ss and vc in tomato fruits van de wal et al 2017 li et al 2022a 2022b there were strong significant influences of irrigation water salinity na ca molar ratio and their interaction on tomato ss and vc concentrations the results of this study about the impacts of irrigation water salinity on the concentration of ss vc and lycopene were in coherent with the previous research zhang et al 2019 li et al 2022a 2022b which revealed that with the same irrigation water salinity the raising na ca molar ratio of irrigation water was favorable to the synthesis of tomato ss vc and lycopene particularly the critical na ca molar ratio value of irrigation water in this study was 5 that may be due to the fact that the concentrations of vc ss and lycopene increased to a certain extent result from the decrease of fruit water concentration which was induced by abiotic stress to attenuate the harmful osmotic effects of salt by osmotic adjustment velterop and vos 2001 verslues et al 2006 additionally with the increasing irrigation water na ca molar ratio the tomato ti increased initially and then decreased when the irrigation water salinity was 1 g l 1 this was similar to the research of li et al 2019a 2019b the study performed by li et al 2019a 2019b has confirmed that the sugar acid ratio increased quadratically with the rising salinity of irrigation water due to the inconsistent increase rate of reducing sugar concentration and organic acid concentration to obtain the desired tomato fruit production irrigation water salinity and na ca molar ratio corresponding to s1r1 treatment was more preferable while the irrigation water salinity and na ca molar ratio corresponds to s2r3 treatment was more appropriate for the improve of tomato ti ss concentration and vc concentration since there was no significant difference between the tomato marketable yield and the total yield for s1r1 and s2r3 treatments the irrigation water with a salinity of 2 g l 1 and na ca molar ratio at 3 or 5 was suggested during the tomato growth period for high yield and good quality 4 3 response of soil salinization and alkalization to irrigation water salinity and na ca molar ratio the soil salt ions movement is generally accompanied by a series of complex dynamic processes which include the participation of physical chemical and biological factors such as soil salt spatial variability precipitation irrigation fertilization surface evaporation and root water uptake li et al 2019a 2019b sar is one of the important indexes to evaluate the soil salinization degree zheng et al 2010 the elevated sar generally corresponds to a high concentration of exchangeable sodium weak capacity for ph buffering saifullah et al 2018 clay dispersion lakhdar et al 2009 severely destroyed structure of soil and low activity of soil microbials lakhdar et al 2009 with lower irrigation water salinity 1 g l 1 there were no distinct impacts of irrigation water na ca molar ratio on sar at 0 100 cm soil layer outside the plastic film while with irrigation water salinity of 3 g l 1 the soil sar at 0 40 cm soil layer inside the film increased with the rising irrigation water na ca molar ratio these results differ from the previous studies ayers and westcot 1985 uccc 1974 as the previous research have shown that the risks of soil degradation by sodium are greater with the lower salts concentration in the irrigation water moreover the variation of topsoil 0 40 cm sar with rising na ca molar ratio of irrigation water was is in agreement with the research of su ying 2006 and shao et al 2015 according to su ying 2006 the topsoil sar increased with increasing irrigation water sar the findings may be attributed to the weak adsorption capacity of soil colloids to na as well as the large amounts of dissolved sodium ions induced by irrigation water with a higher na ca molar ratio furthermore the sar at 40 100 cm soil layer inside the plastic film for s2r1 and s3r1 treatments was lower than the sar for s1r5 and s2r5 treatments respectively the results indicated that the irrigation water with higher salinity and lower na ca molar ratio was more conducive to retarding the rise of soil sar inside the plastic film compared with the irrigation water with lower salinity and higher na ca molar ratio the soil salt accumulation amount in 0 100 cm inside the mulch increased with the increasing irrigation water salinity and na ca molar ratio this result is consistent with the research conclusions from li et al 2019a 2019b and yang et al 2019 and can be attributed to the induction effect of saline water irrigation on soil salt accumulation with the increase of irrigation water salinity and na ca molar ratio the concentration of electrolyte and monovalent cation increased the soil permeability decreased tedeschi and dell aquilar 2005 and the corresponding soil saturated hydraulic conductivity decreased hu et al 2018 huang et al 2019 zhou et al 2021 with the influence of irrigation leaching film mulching topsoil evaporation and soil water infiltration the surface soil sar and the amount of soil salt accumulation at 0 40 cm layer inside the mulch was lower than the value outside the plastic film while the soil sar and the soil salt accumulation amount in 40 100 cm layer inside the mulch were higher than the values outside the film this may be because the suppression of the topsoil evaporation and the inhibition of soil salt accumulated toward the topsoil resulted from the polyethylene mulching huang et al 2016 zhang et al 2017a 2017b previous studies indicate that the appropriate increase of irrigation water salt content was favorable to the amelioration of surface soil an increase of soil effective porosity and improvement of soil permeability to a certain extent li et al 2022a 2022b liao et al 2021 particularly shi et al 2005 recognized that the soil infiltration ability achieved the maximum rate when the irrigation water salinity was 3 g l 1 the irrigation water salinity showed distinct effects on the accumulation of available nitrogen phosphorus and potassium at 0 100 cm soil layer with the same irrigation water salinity the accumulation of available nitrogen phosphorus and potassium at 0 100 cm soil layer increased with the rising na ca molar ratio of irrigation water these results were in accordance with the research of feleafel and mirdad 2014 and tian et al 2018 as they found a certain increase of soil available nutrients during the growth period of greenhouse tomato with saline water irrigation this result may be attributed to the fact that the background values of soil nutrients and the amount of fertilization for treatments were consistent in the experiments while the amount of water and nutrient extraction decreased with the increasing irrigation water na ca molar ratio benderradji et al 2011 hussain et al 2015 lacerda et al 2016 lacerda et al 2018 especially the irrigation water with high salinity furthermore the rise of irrigation water salinity and na ca molar ratio resulted in a decrease in irrigation depth and soil permeability accordingly the leaching amount of soil available nutrients declined to alleviate the exchangeable sodium ions accumulation in the surface soil reduce the soil sar and diminish the soil salt accumulation the irrigation water with salinity of 1 g l 1 and na ca molar ratio at 1 was recommended for the cultivation of tomato in the experimental area additionally due to the fact that the soil salt ions accumulated through the 0 100 cm with the designed drip irrigation patterns during the tomato growth period effective measures flood irrigation with sufficient freshwater during the non growth period application of chemical amendment or organic fertilizer straw incorporation should be considered to maintain the sustainable and ecological development for tomato production 4 4 multi objective evaluation the entropy weight method was used to determine the target weight in this study the topsis method was used for multi objective evaluation and the goals include plant vigorous growth tomato high yield fruit good quality and soil salination prevention from the results the irrigation water with a salinity of 2 g l 1 3 21 ds m 1 and na ca molar ratio of 5 is recommended for tomato cultivation in the experimental area although irrigation water with a salinity of 1 g l 1 and na ca molar ratio of 5 or 7 was more appropriate for plant biomass accumulation and nutrient uptake the biomass accumulation for s2r3 treatment only reduced by 2 73 and 2 96 than that for s1r3 and s1r4 treatments respectively however compared with the fruit ti and vc concentrations for s1r3 and s1r4 treatments the tomato ti for s2r3 treatment increased by 2 7 and 5 56 while the vc concentration for s2r3 treatment increased by 8 1 and 3 8 respectively the irrigation water with a salinity of 1 g l 1 and na ca molar ratio at 1 is more appropriate for soil salinization prevention however the tomato ti ss vc and lycopene concentrations for s1r1 treatment were 12 9 17 9 21 7 and 11 3 lower than that for s2r3 treatment respectively this may be due to the fact that a proper increase of irrigation water salinity and na ca molar ratio results in the decrease of fruit water content to improve the osmotic adjustment ability ben ahmed et al 2009 meanwhile the concentration of reductive sugar ss vc and lycopene increased van de wal et al 2017 li et al 2022a 2022b according to the results of the multi objective evaluation the s2r3 treatment ranked after s1r3 treatment in 2018 and 2019 the s2r3 treatment ranked first and the s1r3 ranked fifth in 2017 importantly the s2r3 treatment ranked more stable than s1r3 treatment in 2017 2019 synthetically the irrigation water corresponding to s2r3 treatment was more proper for tomato cultivation with the designed irrigation pattern in the yinbei yellow river irrigation district china 5 conclusion with mulched drip irrigation for tomato with low salinity 1 g l 1 of irrigation water the increase of na ca molar ratio contributed to the accumulation of plant dry matter and nutrients boost of tomato yield and amelioration of fruit quality the critical value of irrigation water na ca molar ratio for dry matter accumulation plant nitrogen accumulation and plant phosphorus accumulation was 5 while the threshold for marketable yield and total yield was 3 and the critical value for the concentration of vc and lycopene was 7 moreover the fruit ss concentration soil sar in 0 40 cm soil salt accumulation in 0 100 cm and soil available nitrogen accumulation in 0 40 cm increased with the increasing irrigation water na ca molar ratio with the irrigation water salinity at 2 g l 1 or 3 g l 1 the moderate increase of irrigation water na ca molar ratio was conducive to the improvement of tomato quality the critical value for the concentration of ss vc and lycopene was 5 with the same salinity of irrigation water the sar at 0 40 cm soil layer and soil salt accumulation amount in 0 100 cm increased with the increasing na ca molar ratio furthermore the irrigation water with higher salinity and lower na ca molar ratio was more favourable than that with lower salinity and higher na ca molar ratio to increase the plant nitrogen and phosphorus accumulation decrease the soil salt accumulation amount in 0 100 cm soil layer based on the entropy weight topsis analysis with multiple goals plant vigorous growth tomato high yield fruit good quality soil saline alkali prevention the irrigation water with salinity of 2 g l 1 and na ca molar ratio at 5 was suggested for tomato production in the yinbei yellow river irrigation district china a major limitation of the present study is that the variation of ions in plant tissues was not considered

8891,vertical farms vfs are innovative urban production facilities consisting of multi level indoor systems equipped with artificial lighting in which all the environmental conditions are controlled independently from the external climate vfs are generally provided with a closed loop fertigation system to optimize the use of water and nutrients the objective of this study performed within an experimental vf at the university of bologna was to quantify the water use efficiency wue ratio between plant fresh weight and the volume of water used for a lettuce lactuca sativa l growth cycle obtained in two different growing systems an ebb and flow substrate culture and a high pressure aeroponic system considering the total water consumed water used for irrigation and climate management wue of ebb and flow and aeroponics was 28 1 and 52 9 g l 1 h2o respectively during the growing cycle the contribution generated by the recovery of internal air moisture from the heating ventilation and air conditioning hvac system was quantified indeed by recovering water from the dehumidifier water use decreases dramatically by 67 while wue increased by 206 further improvement of wue in the ebb and flow system was obtained through ameliorated crop management strategies in particular by increasing planting densities e g 153 270 and 733 plants m 2 and by optimizing the light spectrum used for plant growth e g adjusting the amount of far red radiation in the spectrum strategies for efficient use of water in high tech urban indoor growing systems are therefore proposed keywords plant factories with artificial lighting pfals aeroponics ebb and flow closed loop systems circularity data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction producing more food while using fewer natural resources is one of the biggest challenges in the climate change adaptation processes wiebe et al 2019 malhi et al 2021 agricultural activities have a great impact on freshwater availability accounting for about 70 of freshwater withdrawals fao 2014 moreover according to climate prediction models rising temperatures in several countries will result in severe water shortages agovino et al 2019 considering these scenarios the implementation of innovative technologies enabling to reduce water use while maintaining or increasing the yield is a priority for the agricultural sector incrocci et al 2020 michelon et al 2021 among these innovative technologies vertical farms vfs are indoor growing structures completely insulated from the outside environment generally located in urban and peri urban environments where plants are normally cultivated in multi layer growing systems using high planting density kozai and niu 2016 avgoustaki and xydis 2021 in this plant production system all the environmental parameters may be precisely controlled guaranteeing a stable year round production independently from outside conditions and season orsini et al 2020 van delden et al 2021 kalantari et al 2018 vertical farming is highlighted as one of the horticultural strategies that can lead to a great resource use efficiency orsini et al 2020 kozai and niu 2016 defined as the amount of resource fixed or utilized by plants compared to the amount of resource supplied to the system kozai and niu 2016 when compared to greenhouses vfs have demonstrated to reduce the water use by 28 95 according to the geographical area in which the growing facilities are located and the greenhouse technologies adopted graamans et al 2018 defining the water use efficiency wue as the grams of fresh weight fw produced per liter of water used in the system literature reports that lettuce production in vfs can reach values as high as 80 g fw l 1 h2o significantly greater than those obtained in greenhouse and open field for the same crop up to 60 and 20 g fw l 1 h2o respectively orsini et al 2020 these great performances are mainly due to the use of modern soilless growing systems where irrigation is usually operated on a closed loop al kodmany 2018 orsini et al 2020 soilless systems are generally classified into substrate culture and hydroponic culture gruda 2020 in both systems water supplies nutrients to the roots in the form of a nutrient solution in substrate culture plants are commonly hosted in pots with an inert substrate and nutrient solution is continuously or periodically distributed as in the case of the ebb and flow system in the hydroponic culture plant roots are directly in contact with the nutrient solution without any solid material gruda 2020 eldridge et al 2020 there are different types of hydroponic cultures which differ mainly in the way the nutrient solution is circulated some examples are the deep water culture dwc where the roots are constantly submerged in the nutrient solution and the aeroponic cultivation where plant roots are periodically sprayed with a fine mist of nutrient solution lakhiar et al 2018 eldridge et al 2020 thanks to a more precise management of the root zone the aeroponic system is usually claimed to better performing although limited literature has to date addressed the comparison with other more widely used soilless systems for vertical farming such as the ebb and flow eldridge et al 2020 orsini et al 2020 independently from the system typology the adoption of closed loops allows for the re use of water and nutrients drained from the growing layer after checking its ph and ec and restoring nutrients level to set point values the nutrient solution may be used again to water the plants avgoustaki and xydis 2021 in this way wue is maximized and both water and nutrients that have not been used by plants may be recycled putra and yuliando 2015 langenfeld et al 2022 also reducing impacts on eutrophication processes rufí salís et al 2020 beside the specific characteristics of the cultivation system wue can be improved through an adequate microclimate management and the ability to reuse water collected from the heating ventilation and air conditioning hvac system katsoulas et al 2015 due to plants transpiration air moisture is high within vfs and through the condensation process it is possible to recover water that can be reused for irrigation thus creating a close water cycle jurga et al 2023 soussi et al 2022 several theoretical models have estimated the contribution of water recovered from the hvac system in both greenhouses lovichit et al 2007 yildiz and stombaugh 2006 and vertical farms pacak et al 2020 and given the interest in this type of analysis it is estimated that the number of models will increase in the coming years in contrast the number of studies that empirically quantify the contribution of water recovered from the hvac system is still limited the advanced cultivation techniques and detailed cultivation protocols tailored to the crop needs are also recognized as having a key role in increasing wue orsini et al 2023 tavan et al 2021 controlled growing conditions that are applied in a vertical farm can in fact increase yield or decrease the required water contribution as for instance in the case of co2 concentration langenfeld et al 2022 and light characteristics for what concerns the light many studies have examined the effects of light quality on crops growth and quality pennisi et al 2019 appolloni et al 2021 particularly for growth the major research effort has been focused on the effect of modulation of red 600 700 nm and blue 400 500 nm wavelengths which match the absorption peaks of the principal pigments chlorophyll a and b involved in light absorption for photosynthesis son and oh 2015 far red radiation 700 780 nm on the other hand has traditionally been excluded from the definition of photosynthetically active radiation par since its contribution to plants photosynthesis has always been considered negligible when applied alone mccree 1971 however recent studies showed that in addition to morphological responses demotes mainard et al 2016 zou et al 2019 far red radiation can positively boost photosynthesis zhen and bugbee 2020 when applied in combination with shorter wavelengths e g red and blue since led lights allow for a fine tuning of the spectrum emitted by the lamps massa et al 2008 precisely managing the far red radiation and in particular its intensity can be a strategy to increase yield the adoption of an optimal planting density is an important parameter in vfs where higher densities as compared to other cultivation systems e g greenhouses or open field are usually used to improve yield per unit of area jin et al 2022 orsini et al 2020 in the case of lettuce cultivation several studies carried out in vfs or growth chambers use a planting density of around 140 plants m 2 on average jin et al 2022 considering that environmental factors can potentially be non limiting testing higher planting densities in combination with precise management of cultivation techniques can lead to an increase in resource use efficiency decreasing the crop water use and increasing the light capture from the canopy ramin shamshiri et al 2018 to the best of our knowledge there is very little work comparing water use in aeroponics and ebb and flow using the same environmental conditions in a vertical farm with artificial light accordingly the objectives of this work were 1 evaluating water use efficiency in a vertical farm for lettuce production considering both the adoption of closed loop soilless systems and the contribution from the water recovery from the hvac system 2 comparatively assess the water use efficiency performances and the lettuce growth in a vertical farm either adopting an ebb and flow or an aeroponic system 3 explore and describe the effect of different cultivation techniques on water use efficiency in the ebb and flow system such as the specific management of far red radiation in the light spectrum and the use of increasing planting density 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental facility and growing conditions the trials have been conducted within almavfarm an experimental vertical farm located in the department of agricultural and food sciences at the university of bologna the facility is composed by an isothermal cell 45 m2 containing two growing system typologies respectively an ebb and flow and a high pressure aeroponic frm srl rovereto tn italy organized in 22 cultivation sectors 10 ebb and flow 12 aeroponics each composed by 3 stacked levels each level consists of a cultivation tray with a surface of 0 53 m2 additionally 3 more aeroponic sectors are dedicated to germination with 5 stacked growing layers additional details on the spatial arrangement of the facility are given in fig 1 a and b the facility is equipped with a heating ventilation and air conditioning hvac system monti c srl borgo a buggiano pt italy for cooling heating and ventilating and with a dehumidifier consisting of a duct system for supply and return of treated air that recovers the water transpired by the plants the ventilation system avoids air stratification by recirculating internal air an hourly exchange rate with the external atmosphere was set at 0 03 m3 m3 h 1 during the trials air temperature and humidity of the vertical farm were set at 24 21 1 c day night and 70 75 10 day night respectively and additional co2 was supplied in order to maintain a constant concentration of 850 ppm the growing systems consist of closed loop water cycles with the drained water returning to a water tank where fertigator nidopro logicsun cattolica rn italy checks 96 time day 1 and if necessary corrects ph and ec parameters before returning the nutrient solution to the water pump and then to the system the same nutrient solution formulation ec 2 3 ds m 1 0 2 ph 6 5 0 2 was used for each experiment with the following composition n no3 14 mm n nh4 4 4 mm p 1 0

droplets between 10 and 30 µm were generated nozzles are visible in fig 1 c in the ebb and flow sectors the nutrient solution was circulated once a day for 30 min for the first two weeks of each growing cycle from 1 to 14 dat and twice a day for 20 min each for the last two weeks from 15 dat to end of the cycle a summary of the environmental parameters and the nutrient solution is given in table 1 three different experiments were conducted as reported in the paragraphs below table 2 shows a summary of the three experiments performed 2 2 experiment 1 exp 1 lettuce growth and water use the first experiment started on february 14 2022 and ended on march 29 2022 lettuce seeds lactuca sativa l var canasta were sown in plastic net pots containing plugs of a biodegradable polymer

ratio of 3 1 rb3 pennisi et al 2019 with a ppfd of 200 μmol m 2 s 1 and a photoperiod of 16 h d 1 at the second true leaf stage 14 days after sowing das plants were moved into their final growing systems for the ebb and flow system plants were transplanted into 6 6 7 cm 0 20 l plastic pots containing peat and then placed into the stacked levels with a planting density of 153 plants m 2 occupying a total surface of 11 4 m2 the transplanting into the ebb and flow system took place in the vertical farm itself the plants altogether with the plugs were gently removed from the net pots and transplanted into the plastic pots filled with peat avoiding any potential damage to the roots for the aeroponic system the plants within the plastic net pots were simply placed into the trays with a planting density of 131 plant m 2 occupying a total surface of 15 0 m2 although we acknowledge that the different planting density could have altered the amount of lighting received by plants in the two systems as well as their final yield the aim of the research was to comparatively assess performances in a commercially productive setting e g adopting commonly used items net pots pots trays in each of the two systems tested nutrient solution fertigation cycles and environmental conditions are described in section 2 1 in the aeroponic system light conditions were the ones applied

consumptions associated with the various components of the systems were monitored the water entering the system was monitored daily by means of flowmeters at the general water input and at the pumps

was calculated by dividing the total leaf area by the unit of ground 2 4 experiment 3 exp 3 optimization of planting density in ebb and flow system the third experiment started on june 6 2022 and ended on july 22 2022 lettuce lactuca sativa l var canasta seeds were sown into polystyrene containers filled with peat where they remained for 14 days inside a growth chamber temperature was set at 20 18 c day night and hps lamps with an intensity of 200 μmol m 2s 1 and a photoperiod of 16 h d 1 were used after 14 das with the second true leaf well developed plants were moved into the vertical farm and transplanted in 3 ebb and flow cultivation sectors where three different planting densities were applied namely 153 270 and 733 plants m 2 for the first two planting densities lettuces have been transplanted in peat filled plastic pots 6 6 7 cm 0 20 l while for the highest density 733 plants m 2 plants have been kept in the same polystyrene containers used for germination although it is recognized that the different containers may have altered plants root system and the overall plant development it was chosen to adopt technical solutions that would normally be pursued by a grower e g when using lower density increasing pot size an rb3 spectrum with 200 µmol m 2 s 1 and a photoperiod of 16 h d 1 were applied for the entire growth cycle in all the sectors with the exclusion of the germination period nutrient solution fertigation cycles and environmental conditions were the same as those described in section 2 1 harvesting was performed at 20 and 33 dat measuring 12 plants per level for a total of 36 plants per treatment lfw ldw yield and dmc were evaluated as described in exp 1 for the monitoring of water consumption the same procedure described for exp 1 was used 2 5 water use efficiency analysis the ratio between leaf fresh weight and water used in response to the different experimental treatments was used to evaluate different water use efficiency scenarios for exp 1 depending on the scenario considered for the analysis water use wu was calculated as the water consumed for the irrigation wi 1 wu w i or wi plus the water used for the hvac system and farm operations wc 2 2 wu t w i w c for the scenario in which the water recovered by the dehumidifier was considered the wu wuf was calculated by subtracting the water recovered from the hvac system wr from wut 3 3 wu f wu t w r for exp 2 and 3 water use efficiency variations were only determined by change in fresh weight indeed water use was not measured individually for the different treatments for these experiments wuf was used 2 6 statistical analysis data were analyzed by a one way anova analysis using spss statistic significant differences between light treatments were tested by tukey test at 95 confidence 3 results and discussion 3 1 water use in almavfarm in the experimental vertical farm analyzed in this study ebb and flow and high pressure aeroponic systems were considered both equipped with close loop water recirculation systems for the lettuce growing cycle carried out simultaneously in the ebb and flow and in aeroponics exp 1 1870 l of water were used table 4 the liters used were allocated between the various components as follow 767 l for irrigation in the ebb and flow system 67 0 l m 2 504 l for irrigation in the aeroponic system 33 5 l m 2 and 599 l used both from the hvac system and by operators for daily cleaning operations in the latter case the total amount of water used was divided by the total surface of the facility resulting in 13 3 l m 2 water used for irrigation and by the hvac system and operations accounted for 68 and 32 of the total table 4 respectively usually moving the water utilization efficiency assessment from a growth chamber to a larger facility water use increases mainly due to the amount of water employed for cleaning and sanitizing operations indeed ohyama et al 2020 reported using 70 of total water use for operations such as trays and equipment cleaning this percentage of course can widely vary according to the type of operations that are carried out in the facility in our case the research was performed in an experimental vertical farm with cleaning operations performed inside the farm water used for cleaning operations was the only amount of water not reused by the system thus accounting for the unique water loss indeed in our experiments 67 of water used as input was recovered from the hvac system accounting for 1263 l table 4 there are different ways to collect water from the internal environment in the study by pacak et al 2020 the potential of water recovery from the exhausted air of the growth chamber using the cross flow plate heat exchanger was checked by the application of a mathematical model results showed that the water recovered was able to cover the water requirements for irrigation when the model was applied to moderate climates beside the theoretical model the potential of water recover was also tested by ohyama et al 2000 in a study performed in a growth chamber during a 15 day growth cycle of sweet potato plants their data showed that up to 76 of the water supplied can be recovered for further irrigation through air dehumidification the higher value obtained can be the result of higher temperature 30 c and relative humidity 80 adopted in their experiment which may have led to different stomatal activity and thus a different level of water transpired by plants and different amount of water used in addition the type of facility and of hvac system as well as its efficiency can affect the amount of water that it is possible to recover from the dehumidification process algarni et al 2018 3 2 plants growth and water use efficiency comparison between ebb and flow and aeroponics with regards to growth plants cultivated in the two growing systems subjected to the same environmental conditions reported comparable growth indeed yield values were between 2 3 and 2 2 kg m 2 and leaf fresh weight ranged 15 1 17 0 g plant 1 table 5 in ebb and flow and aeroponics respectively in previous research yields of different growing systems presented different results according to chandra et al 2014 aeroponic cultivation developed in aeroponic towers located outdoor of several crops such as basil parsley cherry tomato squash bell pepper and kale increased from 19 to 65 as compared to on soil open field cultivation comparing lettuce growth performances in a venlo type glasshouse li et al 2018 reported a greater shoot fresh weight for two lettuce cultivars nenglv naiyou and dasusheng when cultivated in a nutrient film technique system as compared to the aeroponic one at the same time both varieties showed an increase in the root shoot ratio when grown in the aeroponic system meaning that more biomass was allocated to the roots on the other hand puccinelli et al 2021 showed a greater fresh weight in lettuces grown in aeroponics as compared to those grown in a floating system with differences ranging 47 57 depending on the experimental treatment in the same experiment no differences were found in basil plants grown in the two systems these inconsistent trends can be however explained by the different fertigation regimes used in the trials indeed the optimization of aeroponics depends on several variables e g the droplet size the pressure and the frequency for delivering the nutrient solution to the plants li et al 2018 aspects that can influence plants growth this is particularly noteworthy considering that aeroponics is a less adopted technology and that optimal fertigation strategies for different crops are still poorly explored moreover aeroponics is often claimed to make oxygen more accessible at roots level as compared to other typology of substrate culture eldridge et al 2020 tunio et al 2021 in our study the use of an ebb and flow system may have avoided the problem of low oxygen availability that can be a limiting factor for growth in hydroponic cultures especially in system such as the dwc in our results no statistically significant differences were found in dry matter content mean value of 9 5 and in the parameters related to the photosynthetic performances such as stomatal conductance mean value of 209 mmol m 2 s 1 and relative chlorophyll content associated with leaf greenness 23 1 spad units table 5 concerning wue results the aeroponic system was found to be more efficient than the ebb and flow fig 2 considering only the water used for irrigation wi aeroponics achieved a wuie of 69 7 g fw l 1 h20 as compared to 32 5 g fw l 1 h20 for the ebb and flow thus leading to a 114 increase fig 2 a taking also into account the water used by the hvac system and water for operations as inputs wut wute drops by 14 and 24 reaching values of 28 1 g fw l 1 h20 for ebb and flow and 52 9 g fw l 1 h20 for aeroponics respectively fig 2b when water recovered by dehumidifier was removed from total water used wuf wufe increased up to a value of 86 0 g fw l 1 h2o in the ebb and flow system and 161 9 g fw l 1 h2o in the aeroponic one fig 2 c resulting in an augment of 206 these values are even much higher than those reported in literature for wue in vertical farms with the highest values corresponding to 80 g fw l 1 h2o for lettuce cultivation although with some variability according to the crop considered orsini et al 2020 as reported by our data no differences have been found in plants photosynthetic parameters table 5 therefore the differences in wue between the two systems could be attributed to two main factors 1 a more efficient assimilation of water and nutrients in the aeroponics tunio et al 2021 and 2 the lack of substrate in the aeroponic system that would otherwise retain a percentage of the water given as input thus preventing its re use in the close loop system indeed as reported by kozai and niu 2016 plant tissues and substrates embedded 16 of the total water used in particular peat the substrate used for this work has one of the highest water holding capacities when compared to other most commonly used substrate for indoor farming du et al 2022 therefore in a close loop system the substrate may play an important role in terms of wue aspect that must be balanced with final yield and products quality that may also be influenced by the typology of substrate used as shown for instance in red basil microgreens grown with different substrates bulgari et al 2021 although the adoption of the two growing systems did not result in differences in terms of yield table 5 the management of certain root zone parameters represents an opportunity to optimize yield especially in aeroponics in fact the aeroponic system allows for the application of specific cultivation techniques such as the application of co2 at root level which can significantly increase lettuce yield as shown in he et al 2013 3 3 effects of cultivation techniques on water use efficiency 3 3 1 optimal management of light spectrum yield dmc leaf greenness stomatal conductance and lai varied according to the specific amount of far red radiation in the spectrum enriching the spectrum with far red radiation has demonstrated to increase leaf fresh weight and therefore yield of lettuce plants lee et al 2016 for the cultivar sunmang changing the red far red ratio from 0 7 to 4 1 reported an increase ranging 39 50 as compared to red and blue spectrum while zou et al 2019 for cultivar tiberious found a 56 increase adding 50 µmol m 2 s 1 of far red radiation to a red and blue spectrum according to our results yield already increased with rb3 30 46 reaching the highest value with rb3 70 64 as compared to rb3 fig 3 the increase in leaf area is one of the most characterized plants responses in presence of far red radiation representing one of the main features of the shade avoidance response tan et al 2022 in the hereby presented results this effect was confirmed lai increased by 95 by adding 30 μmol m 2 s 1 of far red radiation up to 173 with 70 μmol m 2 s 1 fig 3 the presence of far red radiation has been found to be beneficial specifically at certain growth stages such as in seedlings for increasing biomass through the enhancement of leaf area that can facilitate the light interception as shown in jin et al 2021 and park and runkle 2017 the effect of blue light in enhancing stomatal activity and thus reducing wue has already been well documented in literature pennisi et al 2019 clavijo herrera et al 2018 our results suggest a potential influence of far red radiation on stomatal conductance with a significant reduction by 27 and 54 when rb3 50 and rb3 70 were used as compared to the control this result thus indicates that up to 30 µmol m 2 s 1 of far red radiation replacing the same amount of red and blue radiation in the spectrum do not affect the stomatal conductance fig 3 zhen and bugbee 2020 adding the same amount of white or far red photons to the spectrum reported a lower stomatal conductance in the case of far red radiation suggesting that far red decreases stomata opening as compared to white radiation same results were also found in tomato plants exposed to far red radiation kalaitzoglou et al 2019 although different works reported a reduction in the stomatal conductance in presence of far red radiation the effect of far red on this physiological activity has not yet been clarified tan et al 2022 the trends described in this work could be the results of fewer blue photons in the applied spectrum as a result of the substitution with far red or even a direct action of far red on stomatal closure indeed some studies performed on arabidopsis speculate that far red radiation may reverse the action of blue light on stomata activity talbott et al 2003 an interesting trend was observed for the leaf greenness relative chlorophyll content which decreased by 10 21 increasing the percentage of far red from 0 to 30 70 µmol m 2 s 1 fig 3 a reduction in the chlorophyll content is often attributed to a dilution effect whereby leaf expansion is stimulated by far red radiation at the expense of total organic nitrogen in the leaves mickens et al 2018 li and kubota 2009 zou et al 2021 reported this effect already with low far red radiation in the spectrum e g 15 µmol m 2 s 1 the same trend was found in our results where the effects of far red radiation on relative chlorophyll content was already statistically significant upon 30 µmol m 2 s 1 leading to a decrease 10 fig 3 the effect of far red radiation on photosynthetic process is still a matter of debate since some authors have reported an increase in the photosynthetic activity in the presence of these wavelengths zhen and van iersel 2017 while as claimed by other authors the observed increase in yield is mainly a consequence of the change of certain morphological parameters e g specific leaf area jin et al 2021 according to our results with the substitution of 30 and 50 µmol m 2 s 1 of far red radiation in the spectrum dmc remained unchanged even if the yield was increased while with 70 µmol m 2 s 1 it reported a 25 decrease fig 3 thus a high amount of far red in the spectrum could influence water accumulation processes within tissues explaining the increase in yield that was still found with rb3 70 indeed a reduction in photosynthetic performances in the presence of greater amount of far red radiation rb3 70 can be hypothesized from the results as confirmed by the observed reduced stomatal conductance and chlorophyll content as well as the lower dry matter content fig 3 on the other hand up to 50 µmol m 2 s 1 of far red radiation in the spectrum replacing the same intensity of red and blue radiation seemed not to reduce the photosynthetic rate when compared to the spectrum composed of only red and blue radiation rb3 in literature an increase in dry matter towards the aerial plants organs is reported at low r fr ratio demotes mainard et al 2016 with a greater allocation to the stem as reported for different species by poorter et al 2012 the results of this work highlighted that the precise management of far red in the spectrum can also affect the overall wue of the system with an increase ranging 46 64 with the highest value achieved with the greatest amount of far red in the spectrum rb3 70 fig 3 to conclude the results showed that 1 different morphological and physiological responses may require a different threshold level of far red radiation to be activated and 2 replacing 30 50 μmol m 2 s 1 of red and blue radiation with far red radiation in the spectrum 15 25 of the total radiation in the spectrum can allow for considerable increases in wue without compromising the dmc of the crops 3 3 2 optimal management of planting density the use of three different planting densities resulted in different plants growth at 20 and 33 dat at 20 dat the highest planting density 733 plants m 2 led to an increase in yield 143 as compared to the planting density used as a control 153 plants m 2 but also at the lowest plant fresh weight 2 4 g plant 1 table 6 at 33 dat the adoption of a planting density of 270 plants m 2 resulted in a 91 increase in terms of yield as compared to the control table 6 also in that case the significantly lowest value of plant fresh weight was obtained at the highest planting density 7 3 0 3 g plant 1 on both harvest days the dry matter content was not affected by the adopted planting density table 6 at 20 dat wue at the highest planting density increased by 133 as compared to the lowest one fig 4 reaching 68 3 14 3 g fw l 1 h2o at 33 dat the highest wue was found at 270 and 733 plants m 2 accounting for 135 0 9 4 and 126 10 0 g fw l 1 h2o respectively and resulting in an increase of 62 72 as compared to the lowest planting density fig 4 the range of densities used in vertical farms is quite wide with the average density being around 140 plants m 2 jin et al 2022 similar to the one used as control in this study the results of our study showed that using higher densities especially in the early stages of growth can lead to a significant increase in wue fig 4 without compromising dry matter content table 6 studies on lettuce growth model have reported that the optimal planting density during the growth cycle is the one for which leaf area index remains constant thus increasing the distance between plants as they grown ioslovich and gutman 2000 while this strategy has been analyzed with regard to light use efficiency nicole et al 2016 the results of this study showed that adapting the planting density through the growth cycle can lead to a considerable increase in wue making the practice of dynamic planting density also efficient in terms of use of resources other than land considering that the planting density in a vertical farm can be fully controlled although the applicability of high densities and dynamic densities depends largely on the level of automation used as suggested in van delden et al 2021 this cultivation technique is also effective in terms of resource use efficiency moreover as reported by the simulation performed by lalonde et al 2019 the increase in cultivation density decreases the need of humidification by the system since plants evapotranspiration affects the humidity level of the indoor environment by increasing planting density there could be then the possibility to decrease the water input required for the humidification since as it is shown from our data 32 of the total water is used by the hvac system table 4 on the other hand considering that the rate of crop induced heat gain and loss is not negligible talbot and monfet 2020 increasing the planting density could also affect the cooling requirements of the hvac system lalonde et al 2019 overall what emerges from these scenarios is that in terms of resource use efficiency the next fundamental steps will require the study and characterization of cultivation techniques efficient in the trade off between water and energy consumption in some crops such as green lettuce multiple harvests allow the crops to achieve higher fresh and dry weight carillo et al 2021 thapa et al 2022 therefore with the aim to identifying the optimal density that takes into account various aspects of cultivation it will be crucial to study a possible interaction between the use of high densities and multiple harvests as well as the qualitative parameters of crops in case of high planting densities 4 conclusions in a vertical farm with artificial light the adoption of high pressure aeroponics and ebb and flow systems resulted in the same final lettuce yield however the use of the aeroponic system resulted in an increase of water use efficiency wue by 53 wue values increased significantly 206 also thanks to the recovery of water transpired by plants from the hvac system dramatically impacting the water requirement for irrigation applying specific cultivation techniques such as substituting from 30 to 50 μmol m 2 s 1 15 25 of the total radiation of red and blue radiation with the same amount of far red radiation increased wue by 46 64 without affecting the crop dry matter content moreover using different planting densities depending on the growth stage of the plants 270 plants m 2 allowed to greatly increase wue ranging 62 133 the results of this study therefore showed how the use of innovative technologies and specific cultivation techniques e g the optimal management of far red radiation and planting density can contribute greatly to optimizing water use in an indoor growing system in order to further optimize water use in a vertical farm future studies should deeply characterize the consumption of the hvac system when different cultivation strategies are adopted taking into account the contribution in terms of both energy and water consumption to improve the trade off between different

8891,vertical farms vfs are innovative urban production facilities consisting of multi level indoor systems equipped with artificial lighting in which all the environmental conditions are controlled independently from the external climate vfs are generally provided with a closed loop fertigation system to optimize the use of water and nutrients the objective of this study performed within an experimental vf at the university of bologna was to quantify the water use efficiency wue ratio between plant fresh weight and the volume of water used for a lettuce lactuca sativa l growth cycle obtained in two different growing systems an ebb and flow substrate culture and a high pressure aeroponic system considering the total water consumed water used for irrigation and climate management wue of ebb and flow and aeroponics was 28 1 and 52 9 g l 1 h2o respectively during the growing cycle the contribution generated by the recovery of internal air moisture from the heating ventilation and air conditioning hvac system was quantified indeed by recovering water from the dehumidifier water use decreases dramatically by 67 while wue increased by 206 further improvement of wue in the ebb and flow system was obtained through ameliorated crop management strategies in particular by increasing planting densities e g 153 270 and 733 plants m 2 and by optimizing the light spectrum used for plant growth e g adjusting the amount of far red radiation in the spectrum strategies for efficient use of water in high tech urban indoor growing systems are therefore proposed keywords plant factories with artificial lighting pfals aeroponics ebb and flow closed loop systems circularity data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction producing more food while using fewer natural resources is one of the biggest challenges in the climate change adaptation processes wiebe et al 2019 malhi et al 2021 agricultural activities have a great impact on freshwater availability accounting for about 70 of freshwater withdrawals fao 2014 moreover according to climate prediction models rising temperatures in several countries will result in severe water shortages agovino et al 2019 considering these scenarios the implementation of innovative technologies enabling to reduce water use while maintaining or increasing the yield is a priority for the agricultural sector incrocci et al 2020 michelon et al 2021 among these innovative technologies vertical farms vfs are indoor growing structures completely insulated from the outside environment generally located in urban and peri urban environments where plants are normally cultivated in multi layer growing systems using high planting density kozai and niu 2016 avgoustaki and xydis 2021 in this plant production system all the environmental parameters may be precisely controlled guaranteeing a stable year round production independently from outside conditions and season orsini et al 2020 van delden et al 2021 kalantari et al 2018 vertical farming is highlighted as one of the horticultural strategies that can lead to a great resource use efficiency orsini et al 2020 kozai and niu 2016 defined as the amount of resource fixed or utilized by plants compared to the amount of resource supplied to the system kozai and niu 2016 when compared to greenhouses vfs have demonstrated to reduce the water use by 28 95 according to the geographical area in which the growing facilities are located and the greenhouse technologies adopted graamans et al 2018 defining the water use efficiency wue as the grams of fresh weight fw produced per liter of water used in the system literature reports that lettuce production in vfs can reach values as high as 80 g fw l 1 h2o significantly greater than those obtained in greenhouse and open field for the same crop up to 60 and 20 g fw l 1 h2o respectively orsini et al 2020 these great performances are mainly due to the use of modern soilless growing systems where irrigation is usually operated on a closed loop al kodmany 2018 orsini et al 2020 soilless systems are generally classified into substrate culture and hydroponic culture gruda 2020 in both systems water supplies nutrients to the roots in the form of a nutrient solution in substrate culture plants are commonly hosted in pots with an inert substrate and nutrient solution is continuously or periodically distributed as in the case of the ebb and flow system in the hydroponic culture plant roots are directly in contact with the nutrient solution without any solid material gruda 2020 eldridge et al 2020 there are different types of hydroponic cultures which differ mainly in the way the nutrient solution is circulated some examples are the deep water culture dwc where the roots are constantly submerged in the nutrient solution and the aeroponic cultivation where plant roots are periodically sprayed with a fine mist of nutrient solution lakhiar et al 2018 eldridge et al 2020 thanks to a more precise management of the root zone the aeroponic system is usually claimed to better performing although limited literature has to date addressed the comparison with other more widely used soilless systems for vertical farming such as the ebb and flow eldridge et al 2020 orsini et al 2020 independently from the system typology the adoption of closed loops allows for the re use of water and nutrients drained from the growing layer after checking its ph and ec and restoring nutrients level to set point values the nutrient solution may be used again to water the plants avgoustaki and xydis 2021 in this way wue is maximized and both water and nutrients that have not been used by plants may be recycled putra and yuliando 2015 langenfeld et al 2022 also reducing impacts on eutrophication processes rufí salís et al 2020 beside the specific characteristics of the cultivation system wue can be improved through an adequate microclimate management and the ability to reuse water collected from the heating ventilation and air conditioning hvac system katsoulas et al 2015 due to plants transpiration air moisture is high within vfs and through the condensation process it is possible to recover water that can be reused for irrigation thus creating a close water cycle jurga et al 2023 soussi et al 2022 several theoretical models have estimated the contribution of water recovered from the hvac system in both greenhouses lovichit et al 2007 yildiz and stombaugh 2006 and vertical farms pacak et al 2020 and given the interest in this type of analysis it is estimated that the number of models will increase in the coming years in contrast the number of studies that empirically quantify the contribution of water recovered from the hvac system is still limited the advanced cultivation techniques and detailed cultivation protocols tailored to the crop needs are also recognized as having a key role in increasing wue orsini et al 2023 tavan et al 2021 controlled growing conditions that are applied in a vertical farm can in fact increase yield or decrease the required water contribution as for instance in the case of co2 concentration langenfeld et al 2022 and light characteristics for what concerns the light many studies have examined the effects of light quality on crops growth and quality pennisi et al 2019 appolloni et al 2021 particularly for growth the major research effort has been focused on the effect of modulation of red 600 700 nm and blue 400 500 nm wavelengths which match the absorption peaks of the principal pigments chlorophyll a and b involved in light absorption for photosynthesis son and oh 2015 far red radiation 700 780 nm on the other hand has traditionally been excluded from the definition of photosynthetically active radiation par since its contribution to plants photosynthesis has always been considered negligible when applied alone mccree 1971 however recent studies showed that in addition to morphological responses demotes mainard et al 2016 zou et al 2019 far red radiation can positively boost photosynthesis zhen and bugbee 2020 when applied in combination with shorter wavelengths e g red and blue since led lights allow for a fine tuning of the spectrum emitted by the lamps massa et al 2008 precisely managing the far red radiation and in particular its intensity can be a strategy to increase yield the adoption of an optimal planting density is an important parameter in vfs where higher densities as compared to other cultivation systems e g greenhouses or open field are usually used to improve yield per unit of area jin et al 2022 orsini et al 2020 in the case of lettuce cultivation several studies carried out in vfs or growth chambers use a planting density of around 140 plants m 2 on average jin et al 2022 considering that environmental factors can potentially be non limiting testing higher planting densities in combination with precise management of cultivation techniques can lead to an increase in resource use efficiency decreasing the crop water use and increasing the light capture from the canopy ramin shamshiri et al 2018 to the best of our knowledge there is very little work comparing water use in aeroponics and ebb and flow using the same environmental conditions in a vertical farm with artificial light accordingly the objectives of this work were 1 evaluating water use efficiency in a vertical farm for lettuce production considering both the adoption of closed loop soilless systems and the contribution from the water recovery from the hvac system 2 comparatively assess the water use efficiency performances and the lettuce growth in a vertical farm either adopting an ebb and flow or an aeroponic system 3 explore and describe the effect of different cultivation techniques on water use efficiency in the ebb and flow system such as the specific management of far red radiation in the light spectrum and the use of increasing planting density 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental facility and growing conditions the trials have been conducted within almavfarm an experimental vertical farm located in the department of agricultural and food sciences at the university of bologna the facility is composed by an isothermal cell 45 m2 containing two growing system typologies respectively an ebb and flow and a high pressure aeroponic frm srl rovereto tn italy organized in 22 cultivation sectors 10 ebb and flow 12 aeroponics each composed by 3 stacked levels each level consists of a cultivation tray with a surface of 0 53 m2 additionally 3 more aeroponic sectors are dedicated to germination with 5 stacked growing layers additional details on the spatial arrangement of the facility are given in fig 1 a and b the facility is equipped with a heating ventilation and air conditioning hvac system monti c srl borgo a buggiano pt italy for cooling heating and ventilating and with a dehumidifier consisting of a duct system for supply and return of treated air that recovers the water transpired by the plants the ventilation system avoids air stratification by recirculating internal air an hourly exchange rate with the external atmosphere was set at 0 03 m3 m3 h 1 during the trials air temperature and humidity of the vertical farm were set at 24 21 1 c day night and 70 75 10 day night respectively and additional co2 was supplied in order to maintain a constant concentration of 850 ppm the growing systems consist of closed loop water cycles with the

ratio of 3 1 rb3 pennisi et al 2019 with a ppfd of 200 μmol m 2 s 1 and a photoperiod of 16 h d 1 at the second true leaf stage 14 days after sowing das plants were moved into their final growing systems for the ebb and flow system plants were transplanted into 6 6 7 cm 0 20 l plastic pots containing peat and then placed into the stacked levels with a planting density of 153 plants m 2 occupying a total surface of 11 4 m2 the transplanting into the ebb and flow system took place in the vertical farm itself the plants altogether with the plugs were gently removed from the net pots and transplanted into the plastic pots filled with peat avoiding any potential damage to the roots for the aeroponic system the plants within the plastic net pots were simply placed into the trays with a planting density of 131 plant m 2 occupying a total surface of 15 0 m2 although we acknowledge that the different planting density could have altered the amount of lighting received by plants in the two systems as well as their final yield the aim of the research was to comparatively assess performances in a commercially productive setting e g adopting commonly used items net pots pots trays in each of the two systems tested nutrient solution fertigation cycles and environmental conditions are described in section 2 1 in the aeroponic system light conditions were the ones applied during germination spectrum rb3 ppfd of 200 μmol m 2 s 1 photoperiod of 16 h d 1 while in the ebb and flow system different spectra were applied as explained in section 2 3 for the analysis of growth and physiological data only plants grown under rb3 spectrum were considered corresponding to 12 sectors for the aeroponics and 2 sectors for the ebb and flow system plants were harvested 30 days after transplanting dat measures were carried out on 5 plants per level for a total of 15 plants per sector leaf fresh weight lfw and leaf dry weight ldw obtained after drying the leaves for 72 h at 48 c were measured with a precision balance yield was calculated by multiplying the lfw by the number of plants per m2 and the dry matter content dmc by the ratio between ldw and lfw stomatal conductance was assessed using a leaf porometer ap4 delta t devices cambridge united kingdom taking three measurements for each of the two most developed leaves leaf greenness was estimated using a hand held leaf chlorophyll meter spad 502 konica minolta chiyoda tokyo japan by performing three measurements for each of the two most developed leaves from the transplanting until the final harvest all water consumptions associated with the various components of the systems were monitored the water entering the system was monitored daily by means of flowmeters at the general water input and at the pumps of the ebb and flow and aeroponic systems in addition specifically for the exp 1 water recovered from the hvac system which under normal conditions returns water to the fertigation units was diverted onto another tank in order to be quantified 2 3 experiment 2 exp 2 optimization of the light spectrum in the ebb and flow system experiment 2 was carried out simultaneously with exp 1 from february 14 2022 to march 28 2022 and involved 4 ebb and flow cultivation sectors germination phase was the same as that described in exp 1 at transplanting 14 das 4 lighting spectra were applied the rb3 spectrum was used as a control and 30 50 or 70 µmol m 2 s 1 namely rb3 30 rb3 50 and rb3 70 respectively of red and blue radiation were substituted by the same amount of far red radiation fr peak at 729 nm in all light treatments the ratio between red and blue radiation was maintained constant at 3 1 rb3 as also the photon flux density set at 200 µmol m 2 s 1 and the photoperiod 16 h d 1 specific characteristics of the lighting regimes such as the far red fraction kusuma and bugbee 2021 are given in table 3 nutrient solution fertigation cycles and environmental conditions are reported in section 2 1 plants were harvested at 29 dat measures were carried out on 5 plants per treatment for a total of 15 plants per sector lfw and ldw stomatal conductance and leaf greenness were measured as reported for exp 1 leaf area was assessed through the open software and app easy leaf area developed by university of california usa dmc was calculated as reported for exp 1 and leaf area index lai was calculated by dividing the total leaf area by the unit of ground 2 4 experiment 3 exp 3 optimization of planting density in ebb and flow system the third experiment started on june 6 2022 and ended on july 22 2022 lettuce lactuca sativa l var canasta seeds were sown into polystyrene containers filled with peat where they remained for 14 days inside a growth chamber temperature was set at 20 18 c day night and hps lamps with an intensity of 200 μmol m 2s 1 and a photoperiod of 16 h d 1 were used after 14 das with the second true leaf well developed plants were moved into the vertical farm and transplanted in 3 ebb and flow cultivation sectors where three different planting densities were applied namely 153 270 and 733 plants m 2 for the first two planting densities lettuces have been transplanted in peat filled plastic pots 6 6 7 cm 0 20 l while for the highest density 733 plants m 2 plants have been kept in the same polystyrene containers used for germination although it is recognized that the different containers may have altered plants root system and the overall plant development it was chosen to adopt technical solutions that would normally be pursued by a grower e g when using lower density increasing pot size an rb3 spectrum with 200 µmol m 2 s 1 and a photoperiod of 16 h d 1 were applied for the entire growth cycle in all the sectors with the exclusion of the germination period nutrient solution fertigation cycles and environmental conditions were the same as those described in section 2 1 harvesting was performed at 20 and 33 dat measuring 12 plants per level for a total of 36 plants per treatment lfw ldw yield and dmc were evaluated as described in exp 1 for the monitoring of water consumption the same procedure described for exp 1 was used 2 5 water use efficiency analysis the ratio between leaf fresh weight and water used in response to the different experimental treatments was used to evaluate different water use efficiency scenarios for exp 1 depending on the scenario considered for the analysis water use wu was calculated as the water consumed for the irrigation wi 1 wu w i or wi plus the water used for the hvac system and farm operations wc 2 2 wu t w i w c for the scenario in which the water recovered by the dehumidifier was considered the wu wuf was calculated by subtracting the water recovered from the hvac system wr from wut 3 3 wu f wu t w r for exp 2 and 3 water use efficiency variations were only determined by change in fresh weight indeed water use was not measured individually for the different treatments for these experiments wuf was used 2 6 statistical analysis data were analyzed by a one way anova analysis using spss statistic significant differences between light treatments were tested by tukey test at 95 confidence 3 results and discussion 3 1 water use in almavfarm in the experimental vertical farm analyzed in this study ebb and flow and high pressure aeroponic systems were considered both equipped with close loop water recirculation systems for the lettuce growing cycle carried out simultaneously in the ebb and flow and in aeroponics exp 1 1870 l of water were used table 4 the liters used were allocated between the various components as follow 767 l for irrigation in the ebb and flow system 67 0 l m 2 504 l for irrigation in the aeroponic system 33 5 l m 2 and 599 l used both from the hvac system and by operators for daily cleaning operations in the latter case the total amount of water used was divided by the total surface of the facility resulting in 13 3 l m 2 water used for irrigation and by the hvac system and operations accounted for 68 and 32 of the total table 4 respectively usually moving the water utilization efficiency assessment from a growth chamber to a larger facility water use increases mainly due to the amount of water employed for cleaning and sanitizing operations indeed ohyama et al 2020 reported using 70 of total water use for operations such as trays and equipment cleaning this percentage of course can widely vary according to the type of operations that are carried out in the facility in our case the research was performed in an experimental vertical farm with cleaning operations performed inside the farm water used for cleaning operations was the only amount of water not reused by the system thus accounting for the unique water loss indeed in our experiments 67 of water used as input was recovered from the hvac system accounting for 1263 l table 4 there are different ways to collect water from the internal environment in the study by pacak et al 2020 the potential of water recovery from the exhausted air of the growth chamber using the cross flow plate heat exchanger was checked by the application of a mathematical model results showed that the water recovered was able to cover the water requirements for irrigation when the model was applied to moderate climates beside the theoretical model the potential of water recover was also tested by ohyama et al 2000 in a study performed in a growth chamber during a 15 day growth cycle of sweet potato plants their data showed that up to 76 of the water supplied can be recovered for further irrigation through air dehumidification the higher value obtained can be the result of higher temperature 30 c and relative humidity 80 adopted in their experiment which may have led to different stomatal activity and thus a different level of water transpired by plants and different amount of water used in addition the type of facility and of hvac system as well as its efficiency can affect the amount of water that it is possible to recover from the dehumidification process algarni et al 2018 3 2 plants growth and water use efficiency comparison between ebb and flow and aeroponics with regards to growth plants cultivated in the two growing systems subjected to the same environmental conditions reported comparable growth indeed yield values were between 2 3 and 2 2 kg m 2 and leaf fresh weight ranged 15 1 17 0 g plant 1 table 5 in ebb and flow and aeroponics respectively in previous research yields of different growing systems presented different results according to chandra et al 2014 aeroponic cultivation developed in aeroponic towers located outdoor of several crops such as basil parsley cherry tomato squash bell pepper and kale increased from 19 to 65 as compared to on soil open field cultivation comparing lettuce growth performances in a venlo type glasshouse li et al 2018 reported a greater shoot fresh weight for two lettuce cultivars nenglv naiyou and dasusheng when cultivated in a nutrient film technique system as compared to the aeroponic one at the same time both varieties showed an increase in the root shoot ratio when grown in the aeroponic system meaning that more biomass was allocated to the roots on the other hand puccinelli et al 2021 showed a greater fresh weight in lettuces grown in aeroponics as compared to those grown in a floating system with differences ranging 47 57 depending on the experimental treatment in the same experiment no differences were found in basil plants grown in the two systems these inconsistent trends can be however explained by the different fertigation regimes used in the trials indeed the optimization of aeroponics depends on several variables e g the droplet size the pressure and the frequency for delivering the nutrient solution to the plants li et al 2018 aspects that can influence plants growth this is particularly noteworthy considering that aeroponics is a less adopted technology and that optimal fertigation strategies for different crops are still poorly explored moreover aeroponics is often claimed to make oxygen more accessible at roots level as compared to other typology of substrate culture eldridge et al 2020 tunio et al 2021 in our study the use of an ebb and flow system may have avoided the problem of low oxygen availability that can be a limiting factor for growth in hydroponic cultures especially in system such as the dwc in our results no statistically significant differences were found in dry matter content mean value of 9 5 and in the parameters related to the photosynthetic performances such as stomatal conductance mean value of 209 mmol m 2 s 1 and relative chlorophyll content associated with leaf greenness 23 1 spad units table 5 concerning wue results the aeroponic system was found to be more efficient than the ebb and flow fig 2 considering only the water used for irrigation wi aeroponics achieved a wuie of 69 7 g fw l 1 h20 as compared to 32 5 g fw l 1 h20 for the ebb and flow thus leading to a 114 increase fig 2 a taking also into account the water used by the hvac system and water for operations as inputs wut wute drops by 14 and 24 reaching values of 28 1 g fw l 1 h20 for ebb and flow and 52 9 g fw l 1 h20 for aeroponics respectively fig 2b when water recovered by dehumidifier was removed from total water used wuf wufe increased up to a value of 86 0 g fw l 1 h2o in the ebb and flow system and 161 9 g fw l 1 h2o in the aeroponic one fig 2 c resulting in an augment of 206 these values are even much higher than those reported in literature for wue in vertical farms with the highest values corresponding to 80 g fw l 1 h2o for lettuce cultivation although with some variability according to the crop considered orsini et al 2020 as reported by our data no differences have been found in plants photosynthetic parameters table 5 therefore the differences in wue between the two systems could be attributed to two main factors 1 a more efficient assimilation of water and nutrients in the aeroponics tunio et al 2021 and 2 the lack of substrate in the aeroponic system that would otherwise retain a percentage of the water given as input thus preventing its re use in the close loop system indeed as reported by kozai and niu 2016 plant tissues and substrates embedded 16 of the total water used in particular peat the substrate used for this work has one of the highest water holding capacities when compared to other most commonly used substrate for indoor farming du et al 2022 therefore in a close loop system the substrate may play an important role in terms of wue aspect that must be balanced with final yield and products quality that may also be influenced by the typology of substrate used as shown for instance in red basil microgreens grown with different substrates bulgari et al 2021 although the adoption of the two growing systems did not result in differences in terms of yield table 5 the management of certain root zone parameters represents an opportunity to optimize yield especially in aeroponics in fact the aeroponic system allows for the application of specific cultivation techniques such as the application of co2 at root level which can significantly increase lettuce yield as shown in he et al 2013 3 3 effects of cultivation techniques on water use efficiency 3 3 1 optimal management of light spectrum yield dmc leaf greenness stomatal conductance and lai varied according to the specific amount of far red radiation in the spectrum enriching the spectrum with far red radiation has demonstrated to increase leaf fresh weight and therefore yield of lettuce plants lee et al 2016 for the cultivar sunmang changing the red far red ratio from 0 7 to 4 1 reported an increase ranging 39 50 as compared to red and blue spectrum while zou et al 2019 for cultivar tiberious found a 56 increase adding 50 µmol m 2 s 1 of far red radiation to a red and blue spectrum according to our results yield already increased with rb3 30 46 reaching the highest value with rb3 70 64 as compared to rb3 fig 3 the increase in leaf area is one of the most characterized plants responses in presence of far red radiation representing one of the main features of the shade avoidance response tan et al 2022 in the hereby presented results this effect was confirmed lai increased by 95 by adding 30 μmol m 2 s 1 of far red radiation up to 173 with 70 μmol m 2 s 1 fig 3 the presence of far red radiation has been found to be beneficial specifically at certain growth stages such as in seedlings for increasing biomass through the enhancement of leaf area that can facilitate the light interception as shown in jin et al 2021 and park and runkle 2017 the effect of blue light in enhancing stomatal activity and thus reducing wue has already been well documented in literature pennisi et al 2019 clavijo herrera et al 2018 our results suggest a potential influence of far red radiation on stomatal conductance with a significant reduction by 27 and 54 when rb3 50 and rb3 70 were used as compared to the control this result thus indicates that up to 30 µmol m 2 s 1 of far red radiation replacing the same amount of red and blue radiation in the spectrum do not affect the stomatal conductance fig 3 zhen and bugbee 2020 adding the same amount of white or far red photons to the spectrum reported a lower stomatal conductance in the case of far red radiation suggesting that far red decreases stomata opening as compared to white radiation same results were also found in tomato plants exposed to far red radiation kalaitzoglou et al 2019 although different works reported a reduction in the stomatal conductance in presence of far red radiation the effect of far red on this physiological activity has not yet been clarified tan et al 2022 the trends described in this work could be the results of fewer blue photons in the applied spectrum as a result of the substitution with far red or even a direct action of far red on stomatal closure indeed some studies performed on arabidopsis speculate that far red radiation may reverse the action of blue light on stomata activity talbott et al 2003 an interesting trend was observed for the leaf greenness relative chlorophyll content which decreased by 10 21 increasing the percentage of far red from 0 to 30 70 µmol m 2 s 1 fig 3 a reduction in the chlorophyll content is often attributed to a dilution effect whereby leaf expansion is stimulated by far red radiation at the expense of total organic nitrogen in the leaves mickens et al 2018 li and kubota 2009 zou et al 2021 reported this effect already with low far red radiation in the spectrum e g 15 µmol m 2 s 1 the same trend was found in our results where the effects of far red radiation on relative chlorophyll content was already statistically significant upon 30 µmol m 2 s 1 leading to a decrease 10 fig 3 the effect of far red radiation on photosynthetic process is still a matter of debate since some authors have reported an increase in the photosynthetic activity in the presence of these wavelengths zhen and van iersel 2017 while as claimed by other authors the observed increase in yield is mainly a consequence of the change of certain morphological parameters e g specific leaf area jin et al 2021 according to our results with the substitution of 30 and 50 µmol m 2 s 1 of far red radiation in the spectrum dmc remained unchanged even if the yield was increased while with 70 µmol m 2 s 1 it reported a 25 decrease fig 3 thus a high amount of far red in the spectrum could influence water accumulation processes within tissues explaining the increase in yield that was still found with rb3 70 indeed a reduction in photosynthetic performances in the presence of greater amount of far red radiation rb3 70 can be hypothesized from the results as confirmed by the observed reduced stomatal conductance and chlorophyll content as well as the lower dry matter content fig 3 on the other hand up to 50 µmol m 2 s 1 of far red radiation in the spectrum replacing the same intensity of red and blue radiation seemed not to reduce the photosynthetic rate when compared to the spectrum composed of only red and blue radiation rb3 in literature an increase in dry matter towards the aerial plants organs is reported at low r fr ratio demotes mainard et al 2016 with a greater allocation to the stem as reported for different species by poorter et al 2012 the results of this work highlighted that the precise management of far red in the spectrum can also affect the overall wue of the system with an increase ranging 46 64 with the highest value achieved with the greatest amount of far red in the spectrum rb3 70 fig 3 to conclude the results showed that 1 different morphological and physiological responses may require a different threshold level of far red radiation to be activated and 2 replacing 30 50 μmol m 2 s 1 of red and blue radiation with far red radiation in the spectrum 15 25 of the total radiation in the spectrum can allow for considerable increases in wue without compromising the dmc of the crops 3 3 2 optimal management of planting density the use of three different planting densities resulted in different plants growth at 20 and 33 dat at 20 dat the highest planting density 733 plants m 2 led to an increase in yield 143 as compared to the planting density used as a control 153 plants m 2 but also at the lowest plant fresh weight 2 4 g plant 1 table 6 at 33 dat the adoption of a planting density of 270 plants m 2 resulted in a 91 increase in terms of yield as compared to the control table 6 also in that case the significantly lowest value of plant fresh weight was obtained at the highest planting density 7 3 0 3 g plant 1 on both harvest days the dry matter content was not affected by the adopted planting density table 6 at 20 dat wue at the highest planting density increased by 133 as compared to the lowest one fig 4 reaching 68 3 14 3 g fw l 1 h2o at 33 dat the highest wue was found at 270 and 733 plants m 2 accounting for 135 0 9 4 and 126 10 0 g fw l 1 h2o respectively and resulting in an increase of 62 72 as compared to the lowest planting density fig 4 the range of densities used in vertical farms is quite wide with the average density being around 140 plants m 2 jin et al 2022 similar to the one used as control in this study the results of our study showed that using higher densities especially in the early stages of growth can lead to a significant increase in wue fig 4 without compromising dry matter content table 6 studies on lettuce growth model have reported that the optimal planting density during the growth cycle is the one for which leaf area index remains constant thus increasing the distance between plants as they grown ioslovich and gutman 2000 while this strategy has been analyzed with regard to light use efficiency nicole et al 2016 the results of this study showed that adapting the planting density through the growth cycle can lead to a considerable increase in wue making the practice of dynamic planting density also efficient in terms of use of resources other than land considering that the planting density in a vertical farm can be fully controlled although the applicability of high densities and dynamic densities depends largely on the level of automation used as suggested in van delden et al 2021 this cultivation technique is also effective in terms of resource use efficiency moreover as reported by the simulation performed by lalonde et al 2019 the increase in cultivation density decreases the need of humidification by the system since plants evapotranspiration affects the humidity level of the indoor environment by increasing planting density there could be then the possibility to decrease the water input required for the humidification since as it is shown from our data 32 of the total water is used by the hvac system table 4 on the other hand considering that the rate of crop induced heat gain and loss is not negligible talbot and monfet 2020 increasing the planting density could also affect the cooling requirements of the hvac system lalonde et al 2019 overall what emerges from these scenarios is that in terms of resource use efficiency the next fundamental steps will require the study and characterization of cultivation techniques efficient in the trade off between water and energy consumption in some crops such as green lettuce multiple harvests allow the crops to achieve higher fresh and dry weight carillo et al 2021 thapa et al 2022 therefore with the aim to identifying the optimal density that takes into account various aspects of cultivation it will be crucial to study a possible interaction between the use of high densities and multiple harvests as well as the qualitative parameters of crops in case of high planting densities 4 conclusions in a vertical farm with artificial light the adoption of high pressure aeroponics and ebb and flow systems resulted in the same final lettuce yield however the use of the aeroponic system resulted in an increase of water use efficiency wue by 53 wue values increased significantly 206 also thanks to the recovery of water transpired by plants from the hvac system dramatically impacting the water requirement for irrigation applying specific cultivation techniques such as substituting from 30 to 50 μmol m 2 s 1 15 25 of the total radiation of red and blue radiation with the same amount of far red radiation increased wue by 46 64 without affecting the crop dry matter content moreover using different planting densities depending on the growth stage of the plants 270 plants m 2 allowed to greatly increase wue ranging 62 133 the results of this study therefore showed how the use of innovative technologies and specific cultivation techniques e g the optimal management of far red radiation and planting density can contribute greatly to optimizing water use in an indoor growing system in order to further optimize water use in a vertical farm future studies should deeply characterize the consumption of the hvac system when different cultivation strategies are adopted taking into account the contribution in terms of both energy and water consumption to improve the trade off between different

nonlinear dynamic water productivity wp models and water et based nuptake models were developed the results showed that water stress had a larger impact than n stress on the growth and yield of maize with water stress reducing yield y final aboveground biomass b and n uptake by 36 5 15 4 and 25 7 on average respectively and n stress decreasing them by 18 7 12 3 and 13 6 respectively biomass based water productivity wpb et and yield based water productivity wpy et at the end of the growth period responded differently to water stress but similarly to n stress because of a higher decrease of harvest index hi under water stress than under n stress specifically wpy et decreased significantly while wpb et kept relatively stable as water stress increased the variation of the measured wp during the growth period presented a single peak trend the logistic sigmoid and linear models showed similar high accuracy for quantifying the relationship between evapotranspiration accumulation and biomass growth however the derived wp values from the nonlinear dynamic models were more in line with the single peak variation of the measured wp during the growth period with the agreement index d improved from 0 21 to 0 65 0 75 in comparison to the linear model the developed et based n accumulation models can quantify n uptake through evapotranspiration the results can contribute to improving the accuracy of crop modelling under drought stress conditions and the design of irrigation and n management in arid and semi arid regions keywords plant water relationship nitrogen dilution curve nitrogen use efficiency stress water productivity model nitrogen uptake model data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the area of water saving irrigation in china has increased from 27 3 million ha to 37 8 million ha from 2010 to 2020 while agricultural fertilizer application decreased to 51 9 million tons in 2021 after reaching a peak of 60 2 million tons in 2015 with nitrogen n fertilizer application declining from 24 0 million tons to 18 3 million tons from 2012 to 2020 national data 2022 reducing the consumption of water and n resources is needed for the future sustainable development of agriculture in arid and semi arid regions under the context of climate change because of limited water and damaging environmental impacts of excess n zhang et al 2015 kang et al 2017 therefore research on the response of crop growth and resource use efficiency to water and n stress and its simulation in models is necessary for informing optimal water and n management strategies synergistically improving yields and water and n use efficiencies and promoting sustainable agricultural development and ensuring food security in these regions water productivity wp is a key indicator to investigate water management and sustainable development of agriculture in arid and semi arid regions current studies on wp include comprehensive evaluation of the final wp at the end of the growth season ran et al 2017 el sanatawy et al 2021 kang et al 2021 lu et al 2022 and investigation of the dynamic processes of wp during the growth period steduto et al 2007 ran et al 2019 several studies have reported that water stress during the whole growth period significantly decreases yield based water productivity wpy et wang et al 2019 ye et al 2022 however biomass based water productivity wpb et of maize responded insignificantly to water stress under 100 500 kg n ha 1 n application conditions ran et al 2017 n application usually increases both wpy et and wpb et ran et al 2017 li et al 2019 guo et al 2022 zhang et al 2022 in addition the variation of the final wpy et is highly related to the time duration and extent of water stress for example kang et al 2000 revealed that maize yield responds insignificantly to water stress at the seedling stage resulting in an increase in wpy et a comparison of the responses of wpy et and wpb et to water and n stress is lacking ran et al 2017 found a difference in the response of wpy et and wpb et to water stress at relatively high n application levels without fully taking into account zero n application conditions on the other hand wp is normally considered as a constant during the growth period steduto et al 2007 tsegay et al 2011 adeboye et al 2017 however hsiao et al 2009 observed a law of increasing then stabilizing and finally decreasing wp along the maize growth period by fitting the relationship between measured biomass and evapotranspiration accumulation ran et al 2019 further quantified the dynamic process of wp using logistic and sigmoid models and improved the accuracy of crop modelling under non stress conditions in comparison to a fixed wp logistic and sigmoid models have the advantage of capturing the s shape characteristics of biomass accumulation versus transpiration in comparison to linear models and wp derived from the logistic and sigmoid models is a bell curve instead of a constant ran et al 2019 however the nonlinear dynamic wp model developed by ran et al 2019 did not consider n stress therefore it is necessary to further investigate the response of final wpy et and wpb et at the end of the crop growth season to water and n stress as well as the dynamic change of wp to water and n stress and its modelling during the crop growth period nitrogen use efficiency nue is typically evaluated to determine the capability of crop uptake of n fertilizer from the soil many studies demonstrated that n application can increase the effectiveness and accessibility of soil available n ashraf et al 2016 promote crop n assimilation santachiara et al 2018 maintain the grain filling process and yield formation in the reproductive growth stage li et al 2022a b liu et al 2022 and enhance n harvest index nhi and n seed production efficiency nueg che et al 2015 however extra n application does not show a significant advantage on maize biomass accumulation nor on yield rather reduced n recovery efficiency ren and yield based n use efficiency nueyield wang et al 2019 ye et al 2022 resulting in an increased n mineralization rate tarkalson et al 2022 recent studies have further identified significant correlations between soil water status and n uptake qiang et al 2022 wang et al 2022 zhang et al 2022 and found that water stress inhibits maize n uptake and utilization guo et al 2022 jégo et al 2022 tarkalson et al 2022 showed that overwatering decreases nue and yield however current studies mainly qualitatively analyze the relationship between water status and n uptake and quantitative models are lacking therefore there is a need to further investigate the quantitative relationship between n uptake and water status et of maize at each growth stage and provide a simple way to diagnose the n nutrient status of crops through crop water conditions in this study we hypothesize that wp responds differently to water and n stress and n accumulation can be quantified through evapotranspiration to address the above issues we conducted a two year field experiment with nine irrigation and n treatments each year in arid northwest china to quantify the influence of water and n stress on the growth and resource use efficiencies of maize and develop corresponding process based dynamic models the objectives of this study were to 1 explore the response of final wp and nue to water and n stress 2 improve nonlinear dynamic wp models by accounting for stress conditions 3 develop an et based n uptake model so as to support

arid climate with an average annual precipitation of 164 mm average annual temperature of 8 and total annual accumulated temperature of 3550 d yuan et al 2019 liao et al 2022 the soil is silty loam with an average bulk density of 1 4 g cm 3 for 0 100 cm soil layers field capacity of 0 3 cm3 cm 3 and wilting coefficient of 0 1 cm3 cm 3 ran et al 2018 2 2 experimental methods in this experiment the variety of hybrid seed maize was tianruifeng a complete 2 3 factorial design was used which had two factors water and nitrogen each with three levels three independent replications were taken at each of the 9 32 treatment combinations resulting in a total of 27 32 3 experimental plots the layout of the plots followed a randomized complete block design the three irrigation levels were full irrigation w1 moderate deficit irrigation w0 75 and severe deficit irrigation w0 5 and the three n fertilization rates consisted of applications of 150 n150 75 n75 and 0 kg n ha 1 n0 see supplementary material table s1 irrigation was controlled according to the actual soil water content of the w1n150 treatment in order to ensure that no water stress occurred during the growth period of the w1n150 treatment the soil water content in the root zone was maintained at no less than 65 of the field capacity ran et al 2017 the soil water content for each of the three plots of the w1n150 treatment was monitored with an interval of 10 15 days during the non intensive evapotranspiration period and an interval of 5 7 days during the intensive water consumption period irrigation was applied when the soil water depletion touched the lower threshold of 65 of the field capacity the irrigation amount for the w1 level was calculated based on the difference between actual soil water content and the upper threshold of field capacity the irrigation depth of the w0 75 and w0 5 levels was 75 and 50 of the w1 irrigation depth respectively the same irrigation depth was applied to ensure the emergence of maize in all experimental plots each year table s1 the application of n fertilizer was divided into base n and top dressing n with a 1 1 ratio the base n was applied 5 cm below the soil surface before planting and the top dressing was applied through irrigation during the jointing stage of the female plants maize was sowed on 15 april and harvested in mid september in 2018 and 2019 it was planted with five rows of female plants and one row of male plants the plant spacing was 0 25 m and row spacing was 0 4 m with a planting density of 100 000 plants ha 1 the experimental plot area was 24 m2 and each plot was separated by ridges with a width of 0 4 m and a height of 0 3 m bulk rows were planted between the plots to avoid the edge effect on crop growth and resource use the irrigation method was border irrigation on plots fully covered with perforated plastic mulch the n phosphate and potassium fertilizer were urea n 46 phosphorus pentoxide p2o5 16 and potassium oxide k2o 51 respectively the field management of weeding disease and pest control and phosphate and potassium fertilizer application is consistent with local agricultural production 2 3 measurements meteorological data were collected every 15 min using the weather station hobo onset computer crop usa located at the experimental site measurements included solar radiation air temperature wind speed at 2 m aboveground relative humidity and precipitation daily precipitation and temperature during the maize growth period are shown in fig s1 during the maize growth period aboveground biomass was sampled every 10 15 days three whole plants were randomly selected and cut off from the ground for each treatment each time and all plants sampled were manually divided into leaves including all green and dead leaves stems including all stems and leaf sheaths and ears including all husks cobs and kernels separately they were firstly dried at 105 c for 30 min to deactivate enzyme activity then dried to constant weight at 70 c and weighed the mean value of the three sampled plants from repeated plots is taken as the aboveground biomass of the corresponding treatment at the end of the growth period all plants in a 1 m2 square area in the center of each plot were cut to measure final biomass and yield each plant was manually divided into three parts of stem leaf and ear and the ear was subdivided into husk cob and kernel the drying method and the way for calculating the mean value for each treatment were the same as the time series plant samples the yield was converted from the oven drying weight of the kernel to the weight with a water content of 13 for comparison between different treatments soil water content was measured using the oven drying method every 10 15 days three sampling sites were taken for each treatment from the three corresponding replicated plots each sampling site was set at the center of four adjacent plants in two rows soil samples were collected at 0 10 cm 10 20 cm 20 40 cm 40 60 cm 60 80 cm and 80 100 cm depths using a stainless steel soil auger the auger holes were refilled with the surrounding soil after each sampling to avoid significant preferential flow during irrigation and heavy rainfall soil samples were dried to constant weight in an oven at 105 c for 8 h volumetric water content was obtained by multiplying gravimetric content by bulk density the weighted average soil water content of each soil layer was then calculated for each replication the mean value of the three sampling sites represented the soil water content of the corresponding treatment plant n concentration and accumulation were measured after each biomass measurement all the divided and dried plants from each plot were separately ground and passed through a 0 5 mm sieve resulting in three sets of sieved dry matter powder for each part of the plants for each treatment three equal amounts of 0 5 g samples randomly taken from the three sets of powder for each plant part were used to measure the n concentration for each treatment using the kjeldahl method miao et al 2022 during the growth period n uptake in the aboveground part was obtained by summing the product of the n concentration of each part and the corresponding biomass weight the mean value of the three replications was taken as the plant n concentration and uptake of the corresponding treatment evapotranspiration et was calculated using the water balance method with the reference formula in liao et al 2022 time series wp along the growth period was computed as the ratio of the difference in two adjacent samples of biomass δb to the difference in the corresponding et samples δet the two final wp wpb et and wpy et were calculated as ratios of final biomass b and yield y to total et ran et al 2017 the two irrigation water productivity indicators wpb i and wpy i were the ratios of final biomass b and yield y to total irrigation depth i cai et al 2021 n seed production efficiency nueg was obtained by dividing y by total aboveground n uptake ub n harvest index nhi was the ratio of grain n accumulation uy to ub che et al 2015 the n recovery ren was the difference

ratio of yield y to the applied n rate na ye et al 2022 the actual measured et based n uptake rate nuptake et was calculated as the ratio of the n uptake between two adjacent samples of aboveground biomass δub to the corresponding et difference δet 2 4 water productivity wp models 2 4 1 the wpkr l model the logistic equation thornley 1976 is applied to the relationship between crop biomass

and its utilization efficiency here we choose the n dilution curve to quantify the relationship between n status and maize growth based on the equation proposed by lemaire and salette 1984 5 n u p t a k e α b t 1 β where nuptake is aboveground n accumulation parameter α is n uptake per unit of aboveground biomass and parameter 1 β is the isokinetic coefficient ratio of relative rates between n uptake and its growth rate α is related to the amount of n applied and 1 β is determined by the n nutrient status salette et al 1982 different types of n uptake models based on et are developed by taking the logistic model eq 1 sigmoid model eq 3 and linear model into eq 5 respectively 6 n u p t a k e α b t i 1 β where bti represents the simulated biomass using the logistic model sigmoid model

simulated and measured time series data in this study 3 results 3 1 effects of water and n stress on maize growth and resource use efficiency water stress reduced the final biomass b grain yield y and harvest index hi by 15 4 36 5 and 26 9 on average respectively fig 1 n stress showed a less negative impact compared to water stress reducing b y and hi by 12 3 18 7 and 8 6 on average respectively fig 1 yield loss due to n reduction at high and low irrigation levels was 14 3 and 40 1 respectively on the other hand yield loss caused by the decrease of irrigation depth at n150 and n0 rates was 47 3 and 64 8 respectively fig 2 the total evapotranspiration et of different treatments ranged from 403 to 563 mm which decreased by 17 4 and 3 3 due to water and n stresses on average respectively fig 3 wpb et and wpy et were 3 8 4 7 kg m 3 and 0 6 1 4 kg m 3 respectively with 247 428 mm irrigation and 0 150 kg n ha 1 fertilizer application wpb i and wpy i were 5 1 8 3 kg m 3 and 1 0 2 2 kg m 3 respectively water productivity based on et wpet and the corresponding water productivity based on irrigation depth wpi were significantly correlated p 0 05 fig 1 wpb et slightly increased by 3 2 while wpy et significantly decreased by 24 2 under water stress conditions on average n application increased wpb et and wpy et by 9 1 and 16 5 on average respectively fig 4 the measured wp showed a single peak variation along the increase of et with the quadratic polynomial fitting r2 0 23 d 0 62 being better than the linear regression r2 0 00 d 0 05 fig 5 the aboveground n accumulation ub and seed n accumulation uy of maize ranged from 140 5 to 277 5 kg n ha 1 and 25 0 101 0 kg n ha 1 respectively fig 1 the relationship between n accumulation and biomass was significantly correlated p 0 01 fig 1 n application increased maize n content by 22 2 in the vegetative growth stage and n uptake was reduced by 27 8 under irrigation and n stress conditions in the reproductive growth stage on average fig 6 overall irrigation and n application improved n uptake of maize by 25 7 and 13 6 on average respectively the n seed production efficiency nueg n harvest index nhi yield based n use efficiency nueyield and n recovery efficiency ren responding to the water and n combinations were 18 4 30 2 kg kg 1 17 9 37 3 27 8 101 0 kg kg 1 and 0 3 0 5 kg kg 1 respectively fig 1 increasing irrigation depth improved nueg nueyield and nhi whereas full irrigation reduced ren fig s2a and s2b n application increased nueg and nhi by 8 3 and 10 5 on average respectively but decreased ren and nueyield by 12 2 and 44 8 on average respectively fig s2c and s2d 3 2 simulations of nonlinear dynamic wp models under water and n stress the logistic sigmoid and linear models well represented the relationship between biomass accumulation bt and et increasing along the growth period with r2 0 90 table s2 for all the water and n treatments the logistic sigmoid and linear models showed similar high accuracy for quantifying the relationship between evapotranspiration accumulation and biomass growth process with r2 and nrmse ranged from 0 96 to 0 99 and 7 3 16 4 respectively fig 7a and b table s2 the simulated dynamic and static wp curves of maize during the growth period from the logistic equation sigmoid equation and linear model are shown in fig 7c d and fig s3 the dynamic wp curve showed a single peak in the whole growth period which was similar to the pattern of measured wp fig 7 for w1n150 the d between the simulated wp of wpkr l and wpkr s models and measured wp were 0 64 and 0 73 which were higher than that of the linear model 0 21 for w0 5n0 the d of the wpkr l and wpkr s models were 0 73 and 0 75 which were also higher than the 0 21 of the linear model table s3 the wpkr s model simulated 27 1 higher peak value of wp than the wpkr l model and also showed the peak 50 2 earlier fig 7c water stress increased the peak values of wpkr l and wpkr s dynamic models by 27 1 and 19 6 on average respectively and also resulted in earlier peaks fig s3 n application increased dynamic wp at the whole growth stage fig s3 the standardized linear wp model simulation values varied from 0 9 to 1 1 under different irrigation and n treatments decreasing irrigation from 428 to 247 mm averagely increased 5 6 of the standardized wp values and increasing n application from 0 to 150 kg n ha 1 averagely increased it by 19 1 table s2 3 3 performance of et based dynamic n uptake models logistic sigmoid and linear models showed similar high accuracy in describing the relationship between n uptake nuptake and et fig 8a specifically they were more accurate in quantifying the relationship between nuptake and et under non stress and mild water and n stress treatments r2 0 92 nrmse 14 7 than under the severe water and n stress treatments 0 77 r2 0 84 17 9 nrmse 23 9 fig 8a and table s4 however the derived et based n uptake rates from the logistic sigmoid and linear models showed large residual errors in comparison to the measured values with nrmse exceeding 30 table s5 in the w1n150 treatment the et based n uptake rates simulated by the logistic model after derivation were 0 59 1 25 and 0 19 at the initial middle and end growth stages in comparison to the sigmoid model after derivation of 0 96 2 03 and 0 13 while for the w0 5n0 treatment the logistic and sigmoid models for n uptake rates simulated by the logistic and sigmoid models after derivation were 0 37 0 92 and 0 03 and 0 35 1 35 and 0 3 respectively fig 8b the peak of the sigmoid model after derivation appeared at standardized et 0 17 while it occurred at standardized et 0 42 for the logistic model after derivation for the w1n150 treatment water stress increased the peak value and advanced the appearance time of the n uptake rate while n stress did the opposite fig s4a and s4b the et based n uptake rate simulated by the linear model after derivation showed a monotonic decrease for the whole growth stage with the simulated values decreasing from 2 53 to 0 64 and from 2 10 to 0 43 along the growth period for the w1n150 and w0 5n0 treatments respectively fig 8b and fig s4c 4 discussion 4 1 the priority of water over nitrogen for maize production in arid northwest china compared to w1n150 water stress reduced yield y final aboveground biomass b and harvest index hi by 36 5 15 4 and 26 9 on average respectively while n stress reduced them by 18 7 12 3 and 8 6 respectively fig 1 this indicates that water stress has a greater impact on y b and hi comparing to n stress and y is more susceptible to water and n stress which is similar to the results of li et al 2020 in addition both our results and ran et al 2017 showed that n reduction had a greater impact on yield under water stress and the decrease of irrigation depth caused more yield loss under zero n application than the n150 rate fig 2 this indicates that further reduction of water and n resources will increase yield loss under water and n stress conditions in arid northwest china this result is different from di paolo rinaldi 2008 and ogola et al 2002 in which the negative effect of water deficit is greater with higher n application the reason for the difference might be that adding more water and n resources can mitigate the negative effects of water and n stress on yield in an arid climate environment furthermore we also found that water stress reduced seed n uptake uy aboveground n uptake ub and n harvest index nhi by 42 9 25 7 and 25 4 on average respectively while n stress reduced them less by 19 2 13 6 and 9 2 respectively fig 1 this shows that water stress also has a greater impact on n use efficiency than n stress which was similar to li et al 2022a b it is more important to prioritize the soil water content to promote crop n uptake and yield formation because soil water effectiveness affects the availability of n and crop n uptake pandey et al 2000 thus we conclude that water has priority over nitrogen for crop production in arid northwest china which is consistent with the findings of ran et al 2017 4 2 response of wp and nue to water and n stress our results showed wpy et of hybrid seed maize varied from 0 6 to 1 4 kg m 3 which was slightly higher than the result of 0 4 1 2 kg m 3 in ran et al 2017 water and n stress reduced wpy et by 22 4 and 16 5 on average under border irrigation and mulching conditions in arid northwest china respectively fig 1 guo et al 2022 revealed that wpy et was reduced by 1 7 with water stress on drip irrigated hybrid maize in a semi humid but drought prone region precipitation 632 mm zhang et al 2022 showed a reduction of wpy et of 10 7 in n stress in mulched field maize in the semi arid loess plateau precipitation 548 mm these results show a smaller variation of wpy et than our results in the arid environment 164 mm which indicates that wpy et might be more sensitive to water and n stress under an arid climate on the other hand our results showed wpb et varied from 3 8 to 4 7 kg m 3 fig 1 higher than the 2 8 3 9 kg m 3 in ran et al 2017 which is also true for wpy et the systematic higher wpb et and wpy et might be due to the different varieties in the two studies in addition n stress reduced wpb et by 9 1 on average while water stress increased it by 3 2 instead fig 4 the variation of wpb et is smaller than that in roja et al 2021 11 0 and adeboye et al 2021 29 6 when comparing the responses of wpb et and wpy et to water stress we found that wpy et decreased significantly with increasing water stress fig 4 which is consistent with the results of other studies ran et al 2017 wang et al 2019 xing et al 2021 however wpb et tended to slightly but non significantly increase along with increased water stress fig 4 which is similar to the results of ran et al 2017 this indicates that wpb et and wpy et respond differently to water stress the different response between wpy et and wpb et to et is related to hi which is the ratio of wpy et to wpb et our results showed that hi decreased with the increase of water and n stress and the negative effect of water stress was more pronounced because of a greater slope fig 4 since wpb et is more stable than wpy et in response to water stress ran et al 2017 the change of wpy et should be consistent with hi payero et al 2006 howell and douglas 1990 thus wpy et is reduced because of the potential hi being decreased by water stress su et al 2020 reported that water stress reduces wpy et through yield loss several studies have shown that water stress has a facilitative effect on standardized water productivity ratio of biomass to evapotranspiration or evapotranspiration katerji et al 2013 hellal et al 2019 adeboye et al 2021 which was similar to the response of wpb et to water stress in our study on the other hand applying n had a stimulatory effect on both wpy et and wpb et fig 4 the increase of wpy et and wpb et by n application might be related to the promotion of physiological and biochemical processes including root distribution and seed filling pico et al 2021 ye et al 2022 zhang et al 2022 irrigation significantly p 0 01 affected n uptake and utilization efficiency and water stress reduced nueg nueyield ren and nhi fig 1 which is consistent with other studies jégo et al 2022 lai et al 2022 li et al 2022b water stress also decreased aboveground n uptake ub and seed n accumulation uy limited n assimilation and reduced n utilization of maize on the other hand n application improved nueg and nhi while decreasing nueyield and ren fig 1 and fig s2 this is because n application increases the availability of n to maize resulting in an increased n uptake ashraf et al 2016 however high n application is more likely to lead to n fertilizer mineralization resulting in decreased n fertilizer recovery efficiency wang et al 2019 4 3 strength of nonlinear dynamic water productivity models many studies have simplified the relationship between biomass accumulation bt and transpiration t or evapotranspiration et as a linear relationship which means its slope wp is taken as a fixed value during the growth period steduto et al 2007 tsegay et al 2011 adeboye et al 2017 however our measured wp values were not constant along the growth period which showed a single peak trend and had a higher correlation and agreement to the quadratic curve in comparison to the linear regression fig 5 similar to the dynamic process that hsiao et al 2009 found i e increase stable decrease this dynamic process was further quantified by ran et al 2019 using logistic and sigmoid models where nonlinear dynamic wp models were found to improve the simulation accuracy of biomass under non stress conditions from the average results for all treatments our results showed that the logistic sigmoid and linear models had similar high accuracy for quantifying the relationship between biomass growth and et accumulation fig 7a b and table s2 however the derived wp values from the nonlinear dynamic models were more in line with the single peak variation of the measured wp during the growth period with the agreement index d improving from 0 21 to 0 65 0 75 in comparison to the linear model fig 5 thus from the perspective of wp variation the nonlinear logistic and sigmoid models were more compatible with the relationship between biomass and evapotranspiration than the linear model fig 7c d and table s3 however some wp points in fig 5 were divergent which means these measured wp values calculated using the intervals between every two adjacent samples might have large potential uncertainty the errors might come from the increments of both evapotranspiration and biomass calculated using the intervals between every two adjacent samples the magnitude and the appearance of the peak of simulated dynamic wp were affected by water and n stresses fig 7c d and fig s3 water stress increased the peak value and growth rate of wp at the vegetative growth stage and the severer the stress the more significant the increase on the contrary the wp decreased rapidly due to water stress at the reproductive growth stage and the rate of decrease was significantly related to the degree of water stress fig s3 n application increased the dynamic wp at the whole growth stage under water stress conditions but the current n application has limited benefits for alleviating the effect of water stress on wp the simulation results of nonlinear wp models showed that the wpkr l and wpkr s models underestimated wp in the vegetative growth stage and the wpkr s simulated results were higher than the wpkr l with a larger peak value while the wpkr s simulated results were lower than the wpkr l during the reproductive growth phase fig 7c and d the difference might be related to the different properties of the first order derivative of logistic and sigmoid functions 4 4 feasibility of et based n uptake rate models many studies have found that n uptake and utilization of maize are affected by water availability jégo et al 2022 ye et al 2022 the n cycling is regulated by water which affects the effectiveness and availability of soil n for plant uptake ashraf et al 2016 li et al 2019 qiang et al 2022 zhang et al 2022 our results showed that the logistic sigmoid and linear models had acceptable accuracy for quantifying water consumption and n uptake under different irrigation and n treatments table s4 r2 and nrmse of the three models were higher than 0 92 and lower than 14 7 for no or mild water and n stress and were also higher than 0 79 and lower than 23 9 for heavy water and n stress fig 8a and table s4 our results also indicate that the three et based n uptake models have high feasibility and accuracy for quantifying water status and n uptake of maize throughout the growth period thus we suggest that n accumulation can be quantified through evapotranspiration as an alternative approach the relationship between et and n uptake in different growth stages of maize was significantly correlated p 0 01 fig 8a the logistic and sigmoid models also showed single peaked variation in et based n uptake rates and the latter simulated values were larger than the former in the whole growth period the form of the single peaked curve variation is similar to the results of dynamic wp during the growing period in contrast the et based n uptake rate of the standardized linear model showed a monotonically decreasing form of variation fig 8b and fig s5 this indicates that the pattern of simulated n uptake rates from et based n uptake models depends on the quantitative relationship between biomass and et unfortunately the pattern of et based n uptake rates was not clearly matched in this study which might be caused by the uncertainty of measured n uptake rates fig 8b further study is needed to improve the et based n uptake rate model 4 5 implications and perspectives water and n are two key factors for agricultural production ran et al 2017 wp is a key link between crop production and water consumption especially for arid regions where agriculture heavily depends on irrigation here we demonstrated that final wpb et and wpy et respond differently to water stress and improved the non linear dynamic wp models under water and n stress this deepens our understanding of the relationship between crop water consumption and dry matter accumulation furthermore we have developed three et based n uptake models and intend to predict the nitrogen uptake of maize through water consumption under different levels of n application during the growth period this provides a new perspective for evaluating plant n status thus these results closely link resource inputs and agricultural outputs which is useful for optimizing irrigation and n application management and improving resources use efficiency they are also beneficial for the adaptation of agricultural practices and sustainable maintenance or increase of agricultural productivity in climate smart agriculture fao 2012 the nonlinear dynamic wp models and the et based n uptake models were evaluated using field experiments of maize in arid northwest china in 2018 and 2019 further evaluation is needed on other crops climates and regions with longer time series data in addition the irrigation depth and n application are limited to 247 428 mm and 0 150 kg n ha 1 respectively it is also necessary to add more water and n treatments and sampling frequency to further evaluate model parameters in the future the measured values of wp and nuptake rates calculated using the intervals between every two adjacent samples might have large potential uncertainty which could cause model evaluation difficulties and needs further study the nonlinear dynamic wp models were found to be more consistent in representing the biological process of wp than the linear model however the nonlinear models are more complicated and involve more parameters making model calibration and interpretation more complex the linear model simplifies the growth process and ignores the dynamic change of wp but the calculation is relatively simple and has acceptable simulation accuracy therefore model selection depends on the specific needs of different practical applications the nonlinear dynamic wp models and the et based n uptake models have the potential to be coupled with crop models and machine learning to improve the accuracy of crop growth simulation under stress conditions investigating the sensitivity and uncertainty of the parameters in the developed models following the framework developed by ran et al 2022 is also of interest 5 conclusion water stress had a larger impact than n stress on the growth yield and n uptake of maize in arid northwest china biomass based water productivity wpb et and yield based water productivity wpy et responded differently to water stress but similarly to n stress because hi was more sensitive to water stress than n stress the logistic sigmoid and linear models had similar high accuracy in quantifying the relationship between water consumption and crop growth but the derived nonlinear dynamic wp models were more in line with the single peak variation of measured wp during the growth period the developed et based n accumulation model was able to quantify n uptake through

water productivity wpb et and yield based water productivity wpy et at the end of the growth period responded differently to water stress but similarly to n stress because of a higher decrease of harvest index hi under water stress than under n stress specifically wpy et decreased significantly while wpb et kept relatively stable as water stress increased the variation of the measured wp

increased from 27 3 million ha to 37 8 million ha from 2010 to 2020 while agricultural fertilizer application decreased to 51 9 million tons in 2021 after reaching a peak of 60 2 million tons in 2015 with nitrogen n fertilizer application declining from 24 0 million tons to 18 3 million tons from 2012 to 2020 national data 2022 reducing the consumption of water and n resources is needed for the future sustainable development of agriculture in arid and semi arid regions under the context of climate change because of limited water and damaging environmental impacts of excess n zhang et al 2015 kang et al 2017 therefore research on the response of crop growth and resource use efficiency to water and n stress and its simulation in models is necessary for informing optimal water and n management strategies synergistically improving yields and water and n use efficiencies and promoting sustainable agricultural development and ensuring food security in these regions water productivity wp is a key indicator to investigate water management and sustainable development of agriculture in arid and semi arid regions current studies on wp include comprehensive evaluation of the final wp at the end of the growth season ran et al 2017 el sanatawy et al 2021 kang et al 2021 lu et al 2022 and investigation of the dynamic processes of wp during the growth period steduto et al 2007 ran et al 2019 several studies have reported that water stress during the whole growth period significantly decreases yield based water productivity wpy et wang et al 2019 ye et al 2022 however biomass based water productivity wpb et of maize responded insignificantly to water stress under 100 500 kg n ha 1 n application conditions ran et al 2017 n application usually increases both wpy et and wpb et ran et al 2017 li et al 2019 guo et al 2022 zhang et al 2022 in addition the variation of the final wpy et is highly related to the time duration and extent of water stress for example kang et al 2000 revealed that maize yield responds insignificantly to water stress at the seedling stage resulting in an increase in wpy et a comparison of the responses of wpy et and wpb et to water and n stress is lacking ran et al 2017 found a difference in the response of wpy et and wpb et to water stress at relatively high n application levels without fully taking into account zero n application conditions on the other hand wp is normally considered as a constant during the growth period steduto et al 2007 tsegay et al 2011 adeboye et al 2017 however hsiao et al 2009 observed a law of increasing then stabilizing and finally decreasing wp along the maize growth period by fitting the relationship between measured biomass and evapotranspiration accumulation ran et al 2019 further quantified the dynamic process of wp using logistic and sigmoid models and improved the accuracy of crop modelling under non stress conditions in comparison to a fixed wp logistic and sigmoid models have the advantage of capturing the s shape characteristics of biomass accumulation versus transpiration in comparison to linear models and wp derived from the logistic and sigmoid models is a bell curve instead of a constant ran et al 2019 however the nonlinear dynamic wp model developed by ran et al 2019 did not consider n stress therefore it is necessary to further investigate the response of final wpy et and wpb et at the end of the crop growth season to water and n stress as well as the dynamic change of wp to water and n stress and its modelling during the crop growth period nitrogen use efficiency nue is typically evaluated to determine the capability of crop uptake of n fertilizer from the soil many studies demonstrated that n application can increase the effectiveness and accessibility of soil available n ashraf et al 2016 promote crop n assimilation santachiara et al 2018 maintain the grain filling process and yield formation in the reproductive growth stage li et al 2022a b liu et al 2022 and enhance n harvest index nhi and n seed production efficiency nueg che et al 2015 however extra n application does not show a significant advantage on maize biomass accumulation nor on yield rather reduced n recovery efficiency ren and yield based n use efficiency nueyield wang et al 2019 ye et al 2022 resulting in an increased n mineralization rate tarkalson et al 2022 recent studies have further identified significant correlations between soil water status and n uptake qiang et al 2022 wang et al 2022 zhang et al 2022 and found that water stress inhibits maize n uptake and utilization guo et al 2022 jégo et al 2022 tarkalson et al 2022 showed that overwatering decreases nue and yield however current studies mainly qualitatively analyze the relationship between water status and n uptake and quantitative models are lacking therefore there is a need to further investigate the quantitative relationship between n uptake and water status et of maize at each growth stage and provide a simple way to diagnose the n nutrient status of crops through crop water conditions in this study we hypothesize that wp responds differently to water and n stress and n accumulation can be quantified through evapotranspiration to address the above issues we conducted a two year field experiment with nine irrigation and n treatments each year in arid northwest china to quantify the influence of water and n stress on the growth and resource use efficiencies of maize and develop corresponding process based dynamic models the objectives of this study were to 1 explore the response of final wp and nue to water and n stress 2 improve nonlinear dynamic wp models by accounting for stress conditions 3 develop an et based n uptake model so as to support water saving and n reduction strategies in arid northwest china 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and its description the experiment was conducted at the national scientific field observation and research station for efficient water use in oasis agriculture in wuwei gansu province 102 50 e 37 52 n elevation 1581 m in 2018 and 2019 the region has a typical temperate continental arid climate with an average annual precipitation of 164 mm average annual temperature of 8 and total annual accumulated temperature of 3550 d yuan et al 2019 liao et al 2022 the soil is silty loam with an average bulk density of 1 4 g cm 3 for 0 100 cm soil layers field capacity of 0 3 cm3 cm 3 and wilting coefficient of 0 1 cm3 cm 3 ran et al 2018 2 2 experimental methods in this experiment the variety of hybrid seed maize was tianruifeng a complete 2 3 factorial design was used which had two factors water and nitrogen each with three levels three independent replications were taken at each of the 9 32 treatment combinations resulting in a total of 27 32 3 experimental plots the layout of the plots followed a randomized complete block design the three irrigation levels were full irrigation w1 moderate deficit irrigation w0 75 and severe deficit irrigation w0 5 and the three n fertilization rates consisted of applications of 150 n150 75 n75 and 0 kg n ha 1 n0 see supplementary material table s1 irrigation was controlled according to the actual soil water content of the w1n150 treatment in order to ensure that no water stress occurred during the growth period of the w1n150 treatment the soil water content in the root zone was maintained at no less than 65 of the field capacity ran et al 2017 the soil water content for each of the three plots of the w1n150 treatment was monitored with an interval of 10 15 days during the non intensive evapotranspiration period and an interval of 5 7 days during the intensive water consumption period irrigation was applied when the soil water depletion touched the lower threshold of 65 of the field capacity the irrigation amount for the w1 level was calculated based on the difference between actual soil water content and the upper threshold of field capacity the irrigation depth of the w0 75 and w0 5 levels was 75 and 50 of the w1 irrigation depth respectively the same irrigation depth was applied to ensure the emergence of maize in all experimental plots each year table s1 the application of n fertilizer was divided into base n and top dressing n with a 1 1 ratio the base n was applied 5 cm below the soil surface before planting and the top dressing was applied through irrigation during the jointing stage of the female plants maize was sowed on 15 april and harvested in mid september in 2018 and 2019 it was planted with five rows of female plants and one row of male plants the plant spacing was 0 25 m and row spacing was 0 4 m with a planting density of 100 000 plants ha 1 the experimental plot area was 24 m2 and each plot was separated by ridges with a width of 0 4 m and a height of 0 3 m bulk rows were planted between the plots to avoid the edge effect on crop growth and resource use the irrigation method was border irrigation on plots fully covered with perforated plastic mulch the n phosphate and potassium fertilizer were urea n 46 phosphorus pentoxide p2o5 16 and potassium oxide k2o 51 respectively the field management of weeding disease and pest control and phosphate and potassium fertilizer application is consistent with local agricultural production 2 3 measurements meteorological data were collected every 15 min using the weather station hobo onset computer crop usa located at the experimental site measurements included solar radiation air temperature wind speed at 2 m aboveground relative humidity and precipitation daily precipitation and temperature during the maize growth period are shown in fig s1 during the maize growth period aboveground biomass was sampled every 10 15 days three whole plants were randomly selected and cut off from the ground for each treatment each time and all plants sampled were manually divided into leaves including all green and dead leaves stems including all stems and leaf sheaths and ears including all husks cobs and kernels separately they were firstly dried at 105 c for 30 min to deactivate enzyme activity then dried to constant weight at 70 c and weighed the mean value of the three sampled plants from repeated plots is taken as the aboveground biomass of the corresponding treatment at the end of the growth period all plants in a 1 m2 square area in the center of each plot were cut to measure final biomass and yield each plant was manually divided into three parts of stem leaf and ear and the ear was subdivided into husk cob and kernel the drying method and the way for calculating the mean value for each treatment were the same as the time series plant samples the yield was converted from the oven drying weight of the kernel to the weight with a water content of 13 for comparison between different treatments soil water content was measured using the oven drying method every 10 15 days three sampling sites were taken for each treatment from the three corresponding replicated plots each sampling site was set at the center of four adjacent plants in two rows soil samples were collected at 0 10 cm 10 20 cm 20 40 cm 40 60 cm 60 80 cm and 80 100 cm depths using a stainless steel soil auger the auger holes were refilled with the surrounding soil after each sampling to avoid significant preferential flow during irrigation and heavy rainfall soil samples were dried to constant weight in an oven at 105 c for 8 h volumetric water content was obtained by multiplying gravimetric content by bulk density the weighted average soil water content of each soil layer was then calculated for each replication the mean value of the three sampling sites represented the soil water content of the corresponding treatment plant n concentration and accumulation were measured after each biomass measurement all the divided and dried plants from each plot were separately ground and passed through a 0 5 mm sieve resulting in three sets of sieved dry matter powder for each part of the plants for each treatment three equal amounts of 0 5 g samples randomly taken from the three sets of powder for each plant part were used to measure the n concentration for each treatment using the kjeldahl method miao et al 2022 during the growth period n uptake in the aboveground part was obtained by summing the product of the n concentration of each part and the corresponding biomass weight the mean value of the three replications was taken as the plant n concentration and uptake of the corresponding treatment evapotranspiration et was calculated using the water balance method with the reference formula in liao et al 2022 time series wp along the growth period was computed as the ratio of the difference in two adjacent samples of biomass δb to the difference in the corresponding et samples δet the two final wp wpb et and wpy et were calculated as ratios of final biomass b and yield y to

and its utilization efficiency here we choose the n dilution curve to quantify the relationship between n status and maize growth based on the equation proposed by lemaire and salette 1984 5 n u p t a k e α b t 1 β where nuptake is aboveground n accumulation parameter α is n uptake per unit of aboveground biomass and parameter 1 β is the isokinetic coefficient ratio of relative rates between n uptake and its growth rate α is related to the amount of n applied and 1 β is determined by the n nutrient status salette et al 1982 different types of n uptake models based on et are developed by taking the logistic model eq 1 sigmoid model eq 3 and linear model into eq 5 respectively 6 n u p t a k e α b t i 1 β where bti represents the simulated biomass using the logistic model sigmoid model

harvest index hi by 15 4 36 5 and 26 9 on average respectively fig 1 n stress showed a less negative impact compared to water stress reducing b y and hi by 12 3 18 7 and 8 6 on average respectively fig 1 yield loss due to n reduction at high and low irrigation levels was 14 3 and 40 1 respectively on the other hand yield loss caused by the decrease of irrigation depth at n150 and n0 rates was 47 3 and 64 8 respectively fig 2 the total evapotranspiration et of different treatments ranged from 403 to 563 mm which decreased by 17 4 and 3 3 due to water and n stresses on average respectively fig 3 wpb et and wpy et were 3 8 4 7 kg m 3 and 0 6 1 4 kg m 3 respectively with 247 428 mm irrigation and 0 150 kg n ha 1 fertilizer application wpb i and wpy i were 5 1 8 3 kg m 3 and 1 0 2 2 kg m 3 respectively water productivity based on et wpet and the corresponding water productivity based on irrigation depth wpi were significantly correlated p 0 05 fig 1 wpb et slightly increased by 3 2 while wpy et significantly decreased by 24 2 under water stress conditions on average n application increased wpb et and wpy et by 9 1 and 16 5 on average respectively fig 4 the measured wp showed a single peak variation along the increase of et with the quadratic polynomial fitting r2 0 23 d 0 62 being better than the linear regression r2 0 00 d 0 05 fig 5 the aboveground n accumulation ub and seed n accumulation uy of maize ranged from 140 5 to 277 5 kg n ha 1 and 25 0 101 0 kg n ha 1 respectively fig 1 the relationship between n accumulation and biomass was significantly correlated p 0 01 fig 1 n application increased maize n content by 22 2 in the vegetative growth stage and n uptake was reduced by 27 8 under irrigation and n stress conditions in the reproductive growth stage on average fig 6 overall irrigation and n application improved n uptake of maize by 25 7 and 13 6 on average respectively the n seed production efficiency nueg n harvest index nhi yield based n use

irrigation depth improved nueg nueyield and nhi whereas full irrigation reduced ren fig s2a and s2b n application increased nueg and nhi by 8 3 and 10 5 on average respectively but decreased ren and nueyield by 12 2 and 44 8 on average respectively fig s2c and s2d 3 2 simulations of nonlinear dynamic wp models under water and n stress the logistic sigmoid and linear models well represented the relationship between biomass accumulation bt and et increasing along the growth period with r2 0 90 table s2 for all the water and n treatments the logistic sigmoid and linear models showed similar high accuracy for quantifying the relationship between evapotranspiration accumulation and biomass growth process with r2 and nrmse ranged from 0 96 to 0 99 and 7 3 16 4 respectively fig 7a and b table s2 the simulated dynamic and static wp curves of maize during the growth period from the logistic equation sigmoid equation and linear model are shown in fig 7c d and fig s3 the dynamic wp curve showed a single peak in the whole growth period which was similar to the pattern of measured wp fig 7 for w1n150 the d between the simulated wp of wpkr l and wpkr s models and measured wp were 0 64 and 0 73 which were higher than that of the linear model 0 21 for w0 5n0 the d of the wpkr l and wpkr s models were 0 73 and 0 75 which were also higher than the 0 21 of the linear model table s3 the wpkr s model simulated 27 1 higher peak value of wp than the wpkr l model and also showed the peak 50 2 earlier fig 7c water stress increased the peak values of wpkr l and wpkr s dynamic models by 27 1 and 19 6 on average respectively and also resulted in earlier peaks fig s3 n application increased dynamic wp at the whole growth stage fig s3 the standardized linear wp model simulation values varied from 0 9 to 1 1 under different irrigation and n treatments decreasing irrigation from 428 to 247 mm averagely increased 5 6 of the standardized wp values and increasing n application from 0 to 150 kg n ha 1 averagely increased it by 19 1 table s2 3 3 performance of et based dynamic n uptake models logistic sigmoid and linear models showed similar high accuracy in describing the relationship between n uptake nuptake and et fig 8a specifically they were more accurate in quantifying the relationship between nuptake and et under non stress and mild water and n stress treatments r2 0 92 nrmse 14 7 than under the severe water and n stress treatments 0 77 r2 0 84 17 9 nrmse 23 9 fig 8a and table s4 however the derived et based n uptake rates from the logistic sigmoid and linear models showed large residual errors in comparison to the measured values with nrmse exceeding 30 table s5 in the w1n150 treatment the et based n uptake rates simulated by the logistic model after derivation were 0 59 1 25 and 0 19 at the initial middle and end growth stages in comparison to the sigmoid model after derivation of 0 96 2 03 and 0 13 while for the w0 5n0 treatment the logistic and sigmoid models for n uptake rates simulated by the logistic and sigmoid models after derivation were 0 37 0 92 and 0 03 and 0 35 1 35 and 0 3 respectively fig 8b the peak of the sigmoid model after derivation appeared at standardized et 0 17 while it occurred at standardized et 0 42 for the logistic model after derivation for the w1n150 treatment water stress increased the peak value and advanced the appearance time of the n uptake rate while n stress did the opposite fig s4a and s4b the et based n uptake rate simulated by the linear model after derivation showed a monotonic decrease for the whole growth stage with the simulated values decreasing from 2 53 to 0 64 and from 2 10 to 0 43 along the growth period for the w1n150 and w0 5n0 treatments respectively fig 8b and fig s4c 4 discussion 4 1 the priority of water over nitrogen for maize production in arid northwest china compared to w1n150 water stress reduced yield y final aboveground biomass b and harvest index hi by 36 5 15 4 and 26 9 on average respectively while n stress reduced them by 18 7 12 3 and 8 6 respectively fig 1 this indicates that water stress has a greater impact on y b and hi comparing to n stress and y is more susceptible to water and n stress which is similar to the results of li et al 2020 in addition both our results and ran et al 2017 showed that n reduction had a greater impact on yield under water stress and the decrease of irrigation depth caused more yield loss under zero n application than the n150 rate fig 2 this indicates that further reduction of water and n resources will increase yield loss under water and n stress conditions in arid northwest china this result is different from di paolo rinaldi 2008 and ogola et al 2002 in which the negative effect of water deficit is greater with higher n application the reason for the difference might be that adding more water and n resources can mitigate the negative effects of water and n stress on yield in an arid climate environment furthermore we also found that water stress reduced seed n uptake uy aboveground n uptake ub and n harvest index nhi by 42 9 25 7 and 25 4 on average respectively while n stress reduced them less by 19 2 13 6 and 9 2 respectively fig 1 this shows that water stress also has a greater impact on n use efficiency than n stress which was similar to li et al 2022a b it is more important to prioritize the soil water content to promote crop n uptake and yield formation because soil water effectiveness affects the availability of n and crop n uptake pandey et al 2000 thus we conclude that water has priority over nitrogen for crop production in arid northwest china which is consistent with the findings of ran et al 2017 4 2 response of wp and nue to water and n stress our results showed wpy et of hybrid seed maize varied from 0 6 to 1 4 kg m 3 which was slightly higher than the result of 0 4 1 2 kg m 3 in ran et al 2017 water and n stress reduced wpy et by 22 4 and 16 5 on average under border irrigation and mulching conditions in arid northwest china respectively fig 1 guo et al 2022 revealed that wpy et was reduced by 1 7 with water stress on drip irrigated hybrid maize in a semi humid but drought prone region precipitation 632 mm zhang et al 2022 showed a reduction of wpy et of 10 7 in n stress in mulched field maize in the semi arid loess plateau precipitation 548 mm these results show a smaller variation of wpy et than our results in the arid environment 164 mm which indicates that wpy et might be more sensitive to water and n stress under an arid climate on the other hand our results showed wpb et varied from 3 8 to 4 7 kg m 3 fig 1 higher than the 2 8 3 9 kg m 3 in ran et al 2017 which is also true for wpy et the systematic higher wpb et and wpy et might be due to the different varieties in the two studies in addition n stress reduced wpb et by 9 1 on average while water stress increased it by 3 2 instead fig 4 the variation of wpb et is smaller than that in roja et al 2021 11 0 and adeboye et al 2021 29 6 when comparing the responses of wpb et and wpy et to water stress we found that wpy et decreased significantly with increasing water stress fig 4 which is consistent with the results of other studies ran et al 2017 wang et al 2019 xing et al 2021 however wpb et tended to slightly but non significantly increase along with increased water stress fig 4 which is similar to the results of ran et al 2017 this indicates that wpb et and wpy et respond differently to water stress the different response between wpy et and wpb et to et is related to hi which is the ratio of wpy et to wpb et our results showed that hi decreased with the increase of water and n stress and the negative effect of water stress was more pronounced because of a greater slope fig 4 since wpb et is more stable than wpy et in response to water stress ran et al 2017 the change of wpy et should be consistent with hi payero et al 2006 howell and douglas 1990 thus wpy et is reduced because of the potential hi being decreased by water stress su et al 2020 reported that water stress reduces wpy et through yield loss several studies have shown that water stress has a facilitative effect on standardized water productivity ratio of biomass to evapotranspiration or evapotranspiration katerji et al 2013 hellal et al 2019 adeboye et al 2021 which was similar to the response of wpb et to water stress in our study on the other hand applying n had a stimulatory effect on both wpy et and wpb et fig 4 the increase of wpy et and wpb et by n application might be related to the promotion of physiological and biochemical processes including root distribution and seed filling pico et al 2021 ye et al 2022 zhang et al 2022 irrigation significantly p 0 01 affected n uptake and utilization efficiency and water stress reduced nueg nueyield ren and nhi fig 1 which is consistent with other studies jégo et al 2022 lai et al 2022 li et al 2022b water stress also decreased aboveground n uptake ub and seed n accumulation uy limited n assimilation and reduced n utilization of maize on the other hand n application improved nueg and nhi while decreasing nueyield and ren fig 1 and fig s2 this is because n application increases the availability of n to maize resulting in an increased n uptake ashraf et al 2016 however high n application is more likely to lead to n fertilizer mineralization resulting in decreased n fertilizer recovery efficiency wang et al 2019 4 3 strength of nonlinear dynamic water productivity models many studies have simplified the relationship between biomass accumulation bt and transpiration t or evapotranspiration et as a linear relationship which means its slope wp is taken as a fixed value during the growth period steduto et al 2007 tsegay et al 2011 adeboye et al 2017 however our measured wp values were not constant along the growth period which showed a single peak trend and had a higher correlation and agreement to the quadratic curve in comparison to the linear regression fig 5 similar to the dynamic process that hsiao et al 2009 found i e increase stable decrease this dynamic process was further quantified by ran et al 2019 using logistic and sigmoid models where nonlinear dynamic wp models were found to improve the simulation accuracy of biomass under non stress conditions from the average results for all treatments our results showed that the logistic sigmoid and linear models had similar high accuracy for quantifying the relationship between biomass growth and et accumulation fig 7a b and table s2 however the derived wp values from the nonlinear dynamic models were more in line with the single peak variation of the measured wp during the growth period with the agreement index d improving from 0 21 to 0 65 0 75 in comparison to the linear model fig 5 thus from the perspective of wp variation the nonlinear logistic and sigmoid models were more compatible with the relationship between biomass and evapotranspiration than the linear model fig 7c d and table s3 however some wp points in fig 5 were divergent which means these measured wp values calculated using the intervals between every two adjacent samples might have large potential uncertainty the errors might come from the increments of both evapotranspiration and biomass calculated using the intervals between every two adjacent samples the magnitude and the appearance of the peak of simulated dynamic wp were affected by water and n stresses fig 7c d and fig s3 water stress increased the peak value and growth rate of wp at the vegetative growth stage and the severer the stress the more significant the increase on the contrary the wp decreased rapidly due to water stress at the reproductive growth stage and the rate of decrease was significantly related to the degree of water stress fig s3 n application increased the dynamic wp at the whole growth stage under water stress conditions but the current n application has limited benefits for alleviating the effect of water stress on wp the simulation results of nonlinear wp models showed that the wpkr l and wpkr s models underestimated wp in the vegetative growth stage and the wpkr s simulated results were higher than the wpkr l with a larger peak value while the wpkr s simulated results were lower than the wpkr l during the reproductive growth phase fig 7c and d the difference might be related to the different properties of the first order derivative of logistic and sigmoid functions 4 4 feasibility of et based n uptake rate models many studies have found that n uptake and utilization of maize are affected by water availability jégo et al 2022 ye et al 2022 the n cycling is regulated by water which affects the effectiveness and availability of soil n for plant uptake ashraf et al 2016 li et al 2019 qiang et al 2022 zhang et al 2022 our results showed that the logistic sigmoid and linear models had acceptable accuracy for quantifying water consumption and n uptake under different irrigation and n treatments table s4 r2 and nrmse of the three models were higher than 0 92 and lower than 14 7 for no or mild water and n stress and were also higher than 0 79 and lower than 23 9 for heavy water and n stress fig 8a and table s4 our results also indicate that the three et based n uptake models have high feasibility and accuracy for quantifying water status and n uptake of maize throughout the growth period thus we suggest that n accumulation can be quantified through evapotranspiration as an alternative approach the relationship between et and n uptake in different growth stages of maize was significantly correlated p 0 01 fig 8a the logistic and sigmoid models also showed single peaked variation in et based n uptake rates and the latter simulated values were larger than the former in the whole growth period the form of the single peaked curve variation is similar to the results of dynamic wp during the growing period in contrast the et based n uptake rate of the standardized linear model showed a monotonically decreasing form of variation fig 8b and fig s5 this indicates that the pattern of simulated n uptake rates from et based n uptake models depends on the quantitative relationship between biomass and et unfortunately the pattern of et based n uptake rates was not clearly matched in this study which might be caused by the uncertainty of measured n uptake rates fig 8b further study is needed to improve the et based n uptake rate model 4 5 implications and perspectives water and n are two key factors for agricultural production ran et al 2017 wp is a key link between crop production and water consumption especially for arid regions where agriculture heavily depends on irrigation here we demonstrated that final wpb et and wpy et respond differently to water stress and improved the non linear dynamic wp models under water and n stress this deepens our understanding of the relationship between crop water consumption and dry matter accumulation furthermore we have developed three et based n uptake models and intend to predict the nitrogen uptake of maize through water consumption under different levels of n application during the growth period this provides a new perspective for evaluating plant n status thus these results closely link resource inputs and agricultural outputs which is useful for optimizing irrigation and n application management and improving resources use efficiency they are also beneficial for the adaptation of agricultural practices and sustainable maintenance or increase of agricultural productivity in climate smart agriculture fao 2012 the nonlinear dynamic wp models and the et based n uptake models were evaluated using field experiments of maize in arid northwest china in 2018 and 2019 further evaluation is needed on other crops climates and regions with longer time series data in addition the irrigation depth and n application are limited to 247 428 mm and 0 150 kg n ha 1 respectively it is also necessary to add more water and n treatments and sampling frequency to further evaluate model parameters in the future the measured values of wp and nuptake rates calculated using the intervals between every two adjacent samples might have large potential uncertainty which could cause model evaluation difficulties and needs further study the nonlinear dynamic wp models were found to be more consistent in representing the biological process of wp than the linear model however the nonlinear models are more complicated and involve more parameters making model calibration and interpretation more complex the linear model simplifies the growth process and ignores the dynamic change of wp but the calculation is relatively simple and has acceptable simulation accuracy therefore model selection depends on the specific needs of different practical applications the nonlinear dynamic wp models and the et based n uptake models have the potential to be coupled with crop models and machine learning to improve the accuracy of crop growth simulation under stress conditions investigating the sensitivity and uncertainty of the parameters in the developed models following the framework developed by ran et al 2022 is also of interest 5 conclusion water stress had a larger impact than n stress on the growth yield and n uptake of maize in arid northwest china biomass based water productivity wpb et and yield based water productivity wpy et responded differently to water stress but similarly to n stress because hi was more sensitive to water stress than n stress the logistic sigmoid and linear models had similar high accuracy in quantifying the relationship between water consumption and crop growth but the derived nonlinear dynamic wp models were more in line with the single peak variation of measured wp during the growth period the developed et based n accumulation model was able to quantify n uptake through

8893,the aloe vera plant is an important source of bioactive compounds its growing conditions may have a considerable effect on both its physiological and chemical characteristics thus the objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of joint water and salinity stresses water salinity on the main bioactive compounds of the aloe vera gel the colorless inner parenchymatous tissue also known as inner leaf juice and their related functional properties aloe vera plants were treated with two levels of available soil moisture high and low and five levels of salinity 0 20 40 60 and 80 mm nacl plants grown at high available soil moisture without salt concentration were taken as a control hasm 0 total phenolic compounds aloin cell wall polysaccharides and water soluble polymers were the bioactive compounds analyzed along with the antioxidant activity radical scavenging swelling water retention and fat adsorption capacities in general the water salinity stress negatively affected the development and growing process of the plants however it did cause a considerable increase in the total amount of dry matter from 1 0 to 2 1 g 100 g of fresh aloe vera gel this increase was mainly due to the synthesis of new polysaccharides and in particular of water soluble mannose rich polymers composed of mannose galactose and glucose which increased from 194 4 to 345 8 mg g of water soluble material as water salinity stress increased further there was a significant increase in the aloin content from 10 7 to 19 6 mg g of total solid contents from aloe vera gel these changes in the bioactive compounds were reflected in the functional properties studied hydration properties of aloe vera gel such as swelling and water retention capacity exhibited higher values for those plants treated with water deficit and salinity the antioxidant capacity determined by frap and dpph methods was also higher in the gel from stressed plants overall these results show that water salinity stress could be an agricultural strategy for increasing not only the content of bioactive compounds present in the aloe vera gel but also for improving their related functional properties graphical abstract ga1 keywords aloe vera aloin polysaccharides functional properties water and salinity stresses 1 introduction in recent decades aloe vera aloe barbadensis miller a succulent plant belongs to asphodelaceae family has become one of the most important commercialized medicinal plants in the world grace et al 2015 habeeb et al 2007 manokari et al 2021 in fact processing of the aloe vera leaves generated a revenue of 2 4 billion us dollars in 2019 alone an amount which is expected to increase by up to 3 2 billion us dollars from 2020 to 2027 the global market in aloe vera is led by the usa 65 followed by india 10 and china 10 manokari et al 2021 and its exploitation worldwide is mainly due to the wide spectrum of beneficial properties associated with the different bioactive compounds present in this plant baruah et al 2016 martínez burgos et al 2022 minjares fuentes and femenia 2017 in particular two different types of compounds have been considered as the main biologically active compounds of the aloe vera plant on the one hand there is aloin an anthraquinone c glycoside mainly found in the bitter yellow brownish sap like material localized between the inner parenchymatous tissue the inner leaf gel and the rind of the leaf commonly known as aloe latex highly valued by the pharmaceutical industry due to a variety of biological activities including for example the induction of apoptosis in non small cell lung cancer lee et al 2014 antiviral effects borges argáez et al 2019 antipasmodial activity kumar et al 2017b and anti diabetic effects zhong et al 2022 and on the other hand it contains different polysaccharides such as glucomannans which are responsible for some of the beneficial properties attributed to the plant such as radioprotection kumar and kumar 2019 guided bone regeneration deesricharoenkiat et al 2022 or enhancing the osseointegration in dental implants pachimalla et al 2020 among others these water soluble polymers located within the protoplast of the parenchymatous cells of aloe vera leaves are mainly composed of acetylated mannose linked to glucose by β 1 4 glycosidic linkages chokboribal et al 2015 femenia et al 1999 nevertheless the content and composition of these bioactive compounds as well as their related biological activity can be highly influenced not only by the agro climatic conditions kumar et al 2016 2017a 2017b 2017c but also by the different types of agricultural management applied habibi 2018 hazrati et al 2017 kumar et al 2017a minjares fuentes et al 2017a actually with global climate change the use of saline water in irrigation has increased considerably the low availability of water for use in industrial crops combined with the increasing use of saline water in irrigation has resulted in the interaction of two abiotic stresses water deficit and salinity up to day it has been reported that water deficit modified the molecular weight of water soluble polysaccharides of aloe vera minjares fuentes et al 2017a and also that salinity increased the aloin concentration of aloe vera rahi et al 2013 however the potential alterations on these bioactive compounds and its related functional properties promoted by the interaction of water deficit and salinity remain still unknown therefore the main aim of this study was to assess the effect of the combination of water deficit and salinity water salinity stress on aloin content in aloe vera gel and its related antioxidant capacity and on the polysaccharides present in aloe vera gel and their associated functional properties such as swelling water retention capacity and lipid adsorption capacity 2 materials and methods 2 1 plant material aloe vera leaves used as the raw material for gel extraction were supplied by the

were subjected to abiotic stress conditions particularly combined water and salinity stress conditions hereafter water salinity stress under a shade mesh the shade mesh was utilized as a physical barrier to prevent herbivorous mammals from consuming the aloe plants during the study period the plants received 14 h of sunlight and 10 h of darkness with sunlight serving as the sole source of light the soil was kept at two different levels of available soil moisture high hasm 18 5 2 5 and low lasm 12 5 2 5 that correspond to the field capacity and to the permanent wilting point mota ituarte et al 2023 the irrigation was performed using water with five different saline nacl concentrations 0 20 40 60 and 80 mm murillo amador et al 2014 the soil moisture was monitored using an extech soil moisture meter mo750 nashua new hampshire usa the water salinity stress treatments were carried out during the spring summer april july of 2020 with four repetitions for each treatment at the end of the experiment the visual changes caused by the combination of water deficit and salinity were registered by digital images in order to gain more information about the effect of water salinity stress the digital images of all the stressed aloe vera plants were analyzed using the user free digital image analysis software imagej the color changes in the leaves as a consequence of water salinity stress were analyzed with the rgb measurement plugin while the aperture angle formed by the lateral leaves was measured using the angle function of the imagej software in order to assess the main effects of the abiotic stress on the bioactive compounds present in the aloe vera gel the filets containing the gel were separated from the leaves as described by femenia et al 1999 for the extraction of gel three aloe vera leaves per plant per treatment were selected with a length greater than 30 cm erect and without any mechanical damage whole leaves were washed and the spikes removed before slicing the leaf to separate the epidermis or skin from the filet then the filets were cut into small cubes and crushed before being homogenized in an ultraturrax t18d ika works wilmington nc usa operating at 8000 rpm during 5 min approximately 500 g of homogenized gel was frozen and lyophilized in a laboratory scale freeze dryer labconco freezone triad cascade benchtop

present in the aloe vera gel 2 2 3 identification of aloin by hplc dad in order to obtain more information on changes in the concentration of aloin as a consequence of the water deficit and saline stresses aloe vera gel extracts were submitted to hplc dad analysis aloin from the lyophilized aloe vera gel samples was analyzed by hplc dad according to the methodology previously described by wu et al 2013 with some modifications the chromatographic analysis was carried out using an hplc agilent 1200 agilent technology palo alto ca usa equipped with a diode array detector dad a quaternary pump and two lichrospher c18 5 µm 4 mm 150 mm columns phenomenex connected in series the temperature flow rate and injection loop were of 25 c 0 5 ml min y 20 μl respectively the mobile phase was comprised

and expressed as the percentage of dpph radical inhibition following the eq 1 1 dpph inhibition a control a sample a control 100 where a control and a sample refers to absorbance from control and sample respectively 2 4 analysis of polysaccharides 2 4 1 alcohol insoluble residues airs and isolation of water soluble polysaccharides the airs from lyophilized aloe vera gel were obtained as described by femenia et al 1998 whereas the isolation of water soluble polysaccharides wsp was carried out as described by minjares fuentes et al 2017a with slight modifications the air suspension 500

germany with a fid detector and equipped with a 30 m column db 225 j w scientific folsom ca usa with i d and film thickness of 0 25 mm and 0 15 µm respectively uronic acids were determined by colorimetry as total uronic acids as previously described by blumenkrantz and asboe hansen 1973 2 5 determination of techno functional properties the techno functional properties determined included hydration properties such as swelling sw and water retention capacity wrc and fat adsorption capacity fac sw and wrc of airs from the lyophilized aloe vera gel samples were measured in a phosphate buffer 1 m ph 6 3 while fac was measured using corn oil as previously described by alvarado morales et al 2019 2 6 statistical analysis the results of total phenolic compounds antioxidant capacity and techno functional properties were statistically analyzed by anova the available soil moisture and nacl concentration were taken as factors and a general linear model was utilized to conduct anova with a statistical significance level of α 0 05 prior to the analysis all data underwent normality testing using the shapiro wilk test with a statistical significance level of α 0 05 the post hoc analysis was performed using the lower significant difference lsd test all statistical analyses were performed in minitab software 3 results and discussion 3 1 visual observations it is well known that abiotic stress might lead to a chain of morphological physiological and biochemical changes which may negatively affect the normal growth of plants jäger and meyer 1977 after temperature water deficit and salinity are probably the main types of abiotic stress factors to which plants can be exposed lucero et al 2017 thus the effect of water stress and salt concentration on the appearance and morphology of the aloe vera plants were analyzed fig 1 the application of water salinity stress had negative effects on the appearance and morphology of the plants in general all the stressed plants presented some browning and reduction of the foliar area in particular the plants treated with low available soil moisture lasm fig 1f j exhibited leaf wedging leaf grooving and apex necrosis it is important to highlight that these effects were also observed in those plants cultivated using high available soil moisture and nacl concentration of 80 mm hasm 80 these observations agree with those observed by garcía rodríguez et al 2014 who investigated the growth of aloe vera under different concentrations of nacl these authors reported that plant growth was affected by salinity decreasing the number of new leaves fresh and dry biomass and increasing the necrotic basal leaves dehydration and root necrosis more recently salinas et al 2019 who studied the changes in the morphology of aloe vera aloe barbadensis miller as consequence of water stress observed a decrease in fresh weight and thickness as well as changes in leaf pigmentation in this case the alterations in the morphology and appearance of the aloe vera plants could be the result not only by the water restriction and salinity garcía rodríguez et al 2014 but also by the accumulation of na in the soil which has been considered toxic for the vegetal tissue and one of the most important factor responsible for the growth reduction of plants jin et al 2007 interestingly both stresses water and salinity significantly affected the green color of the leaves while the red and or blue were only affected by salinity p 0 05 table 1 it is important to note that in most plants the green color is mainly attributed to chlorophyll whereas the red and blue have been attributed to the presence of anthocyanins hazrati et al 2016 in particular the green color values varied from 77 3 up to 105 for aloe vera plants subjected to hasm those plants grown at below 20 mm of salinity being those with the highest values however aloe vera plants grown under lasm salinity exhibited green color values ranging from 56 to 91 in this case the highest and lowest values corresponded to aloe vera plants treated with 40 and 80 mm respectively table 1 with regard to the red and blue colors of the aloe vera leaves red values ranged from 71 up to 108 whereas blue ranged from 41 to 72 representing the lowest and highest values from plants grown under lasm 80 and lasm 40 respectively it has been observed that water stress and high light intensity leads to a reduction of chlorophyll in the aloe vera leaves and increases the biosynthesis of anthocyanins which have been considered as sunscreen pigments involved in the protection of the leaf ultrastructure from photo oxidative damage delatorre castillo et al 2022 hazrati et al 2016 likewise it has been observed that salinity may cause the greenness of the amaranthus lividus leaves to turn into red blue as the stress conditions increase this is most likely because of a drastic reduction of chlorophyll since salinity increases the chlorophyllase activity affecting the membrane stability and also weakening the protein pigment lipid complex hossain et al 2022 on the other hand as can be seen in fig 1 the water salinity caused the leaves of the stressed plants to fold this being more noticeable when salinity increased under lasm conditions in fact those aloe vera plants grown under hasm exhibited a rosette form wider than in the case of the aloe plants grown under lasm this observation was related to the angle formed between the lateral leaves in particular the angle from plants grown under hasm ranged from 36 to 60 with plants cultivated under hasm 20 conditions showing the widest rosette whereas for those plants grown under lasm the angle ranged from 28 to 42 the lowest angle observed corresponding to lasm 20 conditions see table 1 the fold of aloe vera leaves has been seen as a defense mechanism against adverse environmental conditions when availability of water becomes very limited which implies the reduction of the evaporative surface of leaf since the adaxial surface receives more solar radiation than the abaxial surface delatorre castillo et al 2022 3 2 total solid contents of aloe vera gel from an industrial point of view the total solid or dry matter content of aloe vera gel plays a critical role in the manufacturing process of aloe vera based products since it is directly related to the content of bioactive compounds and it should be a key parameter to be taken into account during the processing of aloe vera gel minjares fuentes et al 2016 2017b thus the percentage of total solids present in the aloe vera gel was determined in order to evaluate a possible dehydration of the plant as a consequence of the abiotic stress conditions applied the water salinity stress led to significant changes in the percentage of dry matter p 0 05 fig 2 the percentage of dry matter increased as the salinity concentration was augmented this was more noticeable in the gel from those plants cultivated with lasm particularly aloe vera gel from plants grown at lasm 80 exhibited the highest content of dry matter 2 1 these results are in agreement with those of minjares fuentes et al 2017a who observed that dry matter content of aloe vera mucilage increased when water restriction increased further it has been observed that the increase of dry matter in those plants grown under severe stress conditions may be due to the synthesis of secondary metabolites known as osmolytes performing the osmotic adjustment kerepesi and galiba 2000 this response contributes to maintaining cell volume and turgidity avoiding cell dehydration stabilizing and protecting the structure of membranes rhodes et al 2002 3 3 total phenolic compounds tpc a considerable part of the beneficial properties associated with aloe vera have been attributed to the presence of phenolic compounds minjares fuentes and femenia 2019 thus the tpc of aloe vera gel cultivated under water salinity stress conditions were determined as can be seen in table 2 the tpc of the aloe vera gel were significantly affected by water salinity stress p 0 05 the content of tpc varied from 4 8 to 7 9 mg gae g total solid content presents in the aloe vera gel as a consequence of the different treatments applied in particular the gel from those plants grown at hasm 60 treatment showed the highest tpc content being 25 higher in comparison to the control treatment hasm 0 6 3 mg gae g total solid contents interestingly the gel from those plants irrigated with lasm 40 and lasm 60 exhibited the lowest tpc content of 5 25 0 19 and 4 85 0 14 mg gae g total solid contents presents in the aloe vera gel respectively it is also notable that the tpc contents observed in this study are lower than those reported by kumar et al 2017a who analyzed the phenolic compounds content of aloe vera plants from six different agro climatic zones from india these authors observed that tpc ranged from 32 to 66 mg gae g dm the highest concentration being obtained from plants from highland and semi arid agro climatic regions further it has been observed that moderate drought promotes an increase of phenolic compounds in the aloe vera plant habibi 2018 it is important to highlight that the age of aloe vera plants plays a key role in regulating the tpc in the gel hu et al 2003 interestingly it has been observed that the highest phenolic content was higher in 3 year old plants than either in 2 or 4 year old plants ray et al 2013 it is important to point out that plants under different stress conditions may increase the production of phytochemicals with antioxidant capacity such as phenolic compounds flavonoids anthocyanins among others in order to protect the cell membrane delatorre castillo et al 2022 hossain et al 2022 kumar et al 2017c in fact it has been reported that aloe vera grown under water deficit conditions and subjected to high intensity light conditions increases the biosynthesis of anthocyanins to protect the chloroplasts from photo inhibition caused by the ultraviolet radiation resulting in the change of the leaf color from greenness to redness delatorre castillo et al 2022 hazrati et al 2016 3 4 antioxidant activity aa and radical scavenging capacity rsc the water salinity stress also had a significant effect on the aa measured by the abts and frap assays as well as on the rsc determined by the dpph assay p 0 05 table 2 as can be observed the abiotic stress promoted a considerable variation in the aa determined by the frap assay ranging from 2 76 mg te g total solid contents from aloe vera gel for those plants subjected to the highest stress conditions lasm 80 up to 5 65 mg te g total solid contents of gel for aloe vera plants treated under low available soil moisture without nacl lasm 0 further although differences were significant the aa values determined by the abts method exhibited less variation among the different aloe vera gel samples ranging from 5 47 to 5 76 mg te g total solid contents from aloe vera gel on the other hand the radical scavenging capacity determined by the dpph assay exhibited a considerable variation in particular the percentage of dpph radical inhibition ranged from 26 7 up to 44 9 for aloe vera gel from plants treated with hasm whereas for the gel from those plants cultivated using lasm the percentage of inhibition ranged from 23 4 up to 45 4 previously habibi 2018 evaluated the effect of mild and moderate drought stress on the production of phenolic compounds and the phytochemical activity of aloe vera in particular the inhibitory capacity of dpph radical was evaluated for 180 days and the highest percentage of inhibition was found under mild stress conditions similarly it has been reported that aloe plants grown in highland and semi arid zones exhibit higher antioxidant activity dpph inhibition 60 than plants grown in tropical zones which has been attributed to higher production of different bioactive compounds kumar et al 2017c it has been observed that stress conditions increase the production of phytochemicals although the individual content of these compounds can vary depending on the growing environment conditions kumar et al 2017c interestingly these percentages of inhibition are higher than those found in the present study which could be attributed to the age of the plants analyzed since it has been pointed out that the age of the plant has great influence on the antioxidant capacity of the aloe vera compounds the highest values being obtained in 3 year old plants ray et al 2013 therefore it is important to highlight that changes in the antioxidant activity of aloe vera promoted by abiotic stress seems to be limited in the case of 2 year old plants the international aloe science council https www iasc org has defined the aloe vera as a 6 to 8 year crop which is considered productive at 1 5 years old expecting a production of around 11 kg of leaves per plant per year however if the aloe vera plant begins to show premature desiccation and browning leaves as a consequence of the agro climatic conditions including abiotic stress the harvest can be considerably reduced delatorre castillo et al 2022 mota ituarte et al 2023 therefore it is important to implement good agricultural strategies such as a more efficient water management in order to improve the production of bioactive substances from aloe vera plants which in turn will increase its commercial value 3 5 aloin content aloin one of the main bioactive compounds of the aloe vera plant has been used as a taxonomic marker for species of this genus minjares fuentes and femenia 2019 saccù et al 2001 the combination of water stress and salinity had a significant effect on the aloin content fig 3 as can be seen the content of aloin in aloe vera gel varied from 11 to 20 mg g total solid contents from aloe vera gel depending on the irrigation treatment applied interestingly the water deficit as well as the increase in salinity promoted a higher content of this compound p 0 05 particularly the aloin content in the gel from those plants treated at high available soil moisture hasm increased from 10 7 up to 17 4 mg g total solid contents from aloe vera gel when salinity increased from 0 to 60 mm nacl on the contrary at low available soil moisture lasm aloin content decreased from 19 5 to 13 7 mg g total solid contents from aloe vera gel when salinity increased from 40 to 60 mm nacl it is also worth noting that the highest aloin content was observed at low available soil moisture when salinity ranged from 0 to 40 mm nacl the increase in the concentration of aloin in aloe vera due to abiotic stress has been widely reported by different authors hazrati et al 2017 khajeeyan et al 2021 rahimi dehgolan et al 2012 in fact hazrati et al 2017 and khajeeyan et al 2021 who studied the influence of water stress on the aloin content of aloe vera plants reported that it increased as water stress increased on the other hand it has been observed that succulent plants like aloe vera growing in sodic soils are able to sequester higher amounts of co2 as a response in order to compensate the water deficit caused by sodicity rahi et al 2013 further the sequestered co2 is fixed through the calvin cycle during the night and converted into carbohydrates and organic acids which are then used to synthetize high concentrations of various types of osmoprotectants precursors of secondary metabolites through photosynthetic cycles which in turn are able to protect the plant against potential environmental stresses leonardos and grodzinski 2017 rahi et al 2013 thus the increase of the aloin content in aloe vera gel could be the result of the physiological and biochemical response of the plant to the abiotic stress caused by low availability of water as a consequence of the increasing soil salinity the increase of aloin content under stress conditions has been considered as a defense mechanism against external factors since aloin plays a key role in controlling the evapotranspiration process when aloe plants are in heatstroke and under severe drought conditions hazrati et al 2017 khajeeyan et al 2021 rahi et al 2013 sepúlveda jiménez et al 2003 3 6 polysaccharides aloe vera polysaccharides comprising 60 of solid material are not only the predominant bioactive compounds of aloe vera gel but also are considered to be mainly responsible for most of the beneficial properties associated to aloe vera gel chokboribal et al 2015 femenia et al 1999 kumar and kumar 2019 salah et al 2019 for this reason the effect of hydric and saline stress on the main polysaccharides present in aloe vera gel was evaluated thus the carbohydrate composition of the alcohol insoluble residues air s and also of the water soluble polysaccharides wsp extracted from aloe vera gel was determined tables 2 and 3 respectively 3 6 1 airs carbohydrate composition as can be observed in table 3 air s fractions exhibited yields between 32 7 and 49 3 percentage expressed as g air 100 g dry matter these results are higher than those reported by minjares fuentes et al 2017a when assessing the influence of water deficit in the carbohydrate content of aloe vera the carbohydrate analysis revealed that uronic acids ua were the most abundant monosaccharides in all samples followed by mannose and glucose small amounts of galactose xylose arabinose fucose and rhamnose were also determined it is important to note that most of the carbohydrate monomers present in the airs from aloe vera gel were significantly affected by salinity p 0 05 with mannose being the most affected 94 160 mg g air while the available soil moisture had a significant effect on the contents of galactose 26 66 mg g air glucose 91 123 mg g air and uronic acids 234 426 mg g air p 0 05 table 3 the content of high concentrations of uronic acids and low amounts of galactose arabinose and rhamnose are indicative of the presence of pectins which are the predominant type of polymer of the cell walls of aloe vera femenia et al 1999 mcconaughy et al 2008 while the presence of mannose units could be indicative of the occurrence of the acemannan polysaccharide femenia et al 1999 mcanalley 1993 minjares fuentes et al 2017a although femenia et al 1999 found mannose containing polysaccharides as the predominant polymers in the aloe vera gel the predominance of pectic substances has previously been reported by several authors mandal and das 1980 minjares fuentes et al 2017a ovodova et al 1975 in this study such predominance could be attributed to the dehydration process promoted by the water salinity stress it is also important to note that the highest mannose content was observed in the airs from the gel of aloe vera plants grown at lasm 80 supporting the idea that abiotic conditions may induce the biosynthesis of the acemannan polymer this fact may improve the water management inside the parenchymatous tissues in order to maintain essential functions of the aloe vera plant when water is restricted ahl et al 2019 femenia et al 1999 minjares fuentes et al 2017a on the other hand pectic substances were the cell wall polymer most affected by the hydric saline stress as could be inferred from the variation in the uronic acid amounts present in the different samples interestingly the pectin content of plants treated under hasm was higher than the plants under lasm the hasm 60 treatment being that which exhibited the greatest amount of pectic substances it has been proposed that mannans and pectins play a key role in the transport of water from parenchyma to chlorenchyma when plants are under stress conditions although the mechanisms involved in this phenomenon are still unclear delatorre castillo et al 2022 xing et al 2022 finally the considerable amounts of glucose suggest the presence of cellulose while the small amounts of xylose and fucose could be associated with the presence of hemicellulosic polymers in particular xyloglucans ahl et al 2019 femenia et al 1999 minjares fuentes et al 2017a these polysaccharides were almost not affected by the water salinity stress this latter observation is in agreement with the work of minjares fuentes et al 2017a this result supports the idea that aloe vera xyloglucans polysaccharides may play a critical role in the scaffold forming of cell walls together with cellulose ahl et al 2019 nevertheless further structural studies are required in order to identify possible alterations to these cell wall forming polymers under abiotic stress 3 6 2 water soluble polysaccharides wsp a previous study showed that wsp present in aloe vera gel were severely affected by water deficit minjares fuentes et al 2017a however there is no information on the effect of salinity neither on the combination of water salinity stress on the chemical composition of wsp present in aloe vera gel as can be seen in table 4 the yields of wsp fractions presented a considerable variation p 0 05 ranging from 11 to 18 g wsp 100 g dry matter in all the samples mannose was the most abundant monosaccharide followed by notable amounts of uronic acids and glucose to a lesser extent monosaccharides such as galactose xylose arabinose fucose and rhamnose were also detected the high concentration of mannose units together with smaller amounts of glucose in the wsp fractions suggests the presence of the acemannan polysaccharide identified as the main polysaccharide present in aloe vera gel by several authors femenia et al 1999 mcanalley 1993 minjares fuentes et al 2017a interestingly in all the aloe vera samples salinity greatly increased the concentration of mannose in comparison with the control treatment hasm 0 in particular the treatment with the highest stress level i e lasm 80 showed the highest increase in mannose reaching up to 300 60 mg man g wsp similarly glucose increased from 15 75 mg g in the control treatment to 35 68 mg g in the lasm 80 sample the increase in the acemannan polysaccharide as a consequence of water deficit has been previously reported by various authors ahl et al 2019 delatorre herrera et al 2010 minjares fuentes et al 2017a quezada et al 2017 although there are no reports of such an increase due to the combination of water deficit and salinity this increase could be considered as a response mechanism to the abiotic stress applied enhancing the water retention into cells in order to avoid dehydration of the tissues delatorre herrera et al 2010 on the contrary minjares fuentes et al 2017a who studied the effect of water deficit 0 40 and 60 on the composition of the main polysaccharides of aloe vera gel observed a significant decrease in the acemannan polymer when the water deficit increased from 0 to 60 these authors suggested that acemannan was probably metabolized by the plant as a defense mechanism against abiotic stress the low molecular weight fractions being the most affected minjares fuentes et al 2017a on the other hand the presence of considerable amounts of uronic acids in the wsp fractions is indicative of pectic polysaccharides similar results were observed by femenia et al 1999 and minjares fuentes et al 2017a when analyzing the water soluble fraction of aloe vera gel these authors proposed that pectic polysaccharides present in water soluble fractions could be released from the middle lamella and not from the cell walls femenia et al 1999 minjares fuentes et al 2017a 3 7 techno functional properties the functional properties related to polysaccharides depend not only on their chemical composition but also on the way these polymers are interconnected to form the three dimensional structures jarvis 2011 it is well known that techno functional properties of aloe vera such as retention of water and oil adsorption are mainly related to the concentration type and composition of polysaccharides alvarado morales et al 2019 chokboribal et al 2015 minjares fuentes et al 2017b rodríguez gonzález et al 2011 however there is no information about the modification of these properties as a consequence of polysaccharide alterations caused by water salinity stress therefore the effect of different stress levels on the techno functional properties of the air s fractions obtained from the aloe vera gel was evaluated fig 4 water salinity stress had significant effects p 0 05 on the different properties evaluated such as swelling sw water retention capacity wrc and oil adsorption capacity fac as can be observed in fig 4a sw values ranged from 56 1 to 84 4 ml g air interestingly those plants treated with abundant irrigation hasm exhibited higher sw values than plants treated with water deficit lasm particularly sw from hasm plants showed an increase of between 30 and 40 in relation to the control sample 63 ml g air on the other hand no significant differences were observed between lasm and the control plant except for samples corresponding to lasm 80 plants which exhibited a sw value of 80 ml g air changes in sw values due to external factors have previously been observed by several authors alvarado morales et al 2019 femenia et al 2003 rodríguez gonzález et al 2011 previous reports have shown that sw of aloe vera gel can vary from 40 ml g up to 70 ml g or even up to 150 ml g when the aloe vera gel was processed either by convective drying femenia et al 2003 or thermosonication alvarado morales et al 2019 nevertheless rodriguez gonzalez et al 2012 who studied the effect of pasteurization on functional properties observed that the sw of pasteurized aloe vera gel reached values even higher than 300 ml g air the ability of polysaccharide rich materials to swell has widely been associated with the reduction of cholesterol levels in blood elleuch et al 2011 mackie et al 2016 mudgil and barak 2013 regarding wrc water stress and salinity also had a significant effect on this property p 0 05 see fig 4b as can be seen wrc values showed a wide variation from 28 to 75 g h2o g air aloe vera plants treated with hasm 0 exhibited a wrc of 59 98 1 14 g h2o g air interestingly the water restriction led to a significant increase of wrc when salinity increased from 0 to 40 mm nacl reaching values of up to 75 g h2o g air p 0 05 these wrc values are higher than those previously reported by other authors for example rodríguez gonzález et al 2011 reported values between 22 1 and 27 9 g h2o g air when aloe vera gel was pasteurized at 65 c for 25 min and 75 c for 25 min respectively further alvarado morales et al 2019 who assessed the impact of the thermosonication process on the functional properties found wrc values comprising between 30 and 50 g h2o g air these authors suggested that low wrc could be attributed to the occurrence of water soluble low molecular weight polysaccharide rich material in the thermosonicated aloe vera gel finally the results of the effect of water stress and salinity in the fac of aloe vera samples are showed in fig 4c as can be seen abiotic stress due to water deficit and salinity had a significant but limited effect on fac from aloe vera gel p 0 05 the gel from those aloe vera plants taken as a control hasm 0 showed a fac value of 42 34 1 82 g oil g air interestingly lasm 40 and lasm 80 samples exhibited the highest fac values 46 g oil g air whereas the rest of the samples showed a significant reduction of between 10 and 15 in comparison to the control sample these results are slightly higher than those reported by rodríguez gonzález et al 2011 who observed fac values between 32 and 35 g oil g air in pasteurized aloe vera gel on the contrary alvarado morales et al 2019 reported an increase in the fac when aloe vera was thermosonicated at 50 c for 6 min reaching values of up to 120 g oil g air the effect of water salinity stress on the concentration and potential structural modifications of the polysaccharides present in the aloe vera gel could be responsible for the observed variations in the functional properties determined in this study 4 conclusions the present study focused on the impact of the combination of water and salinity stress on the main bioactive compounds of the aloe vera gel and its related functional properties as expected the abiotic stress caused by water deficit and salinity affected negatively the appearance of the aloe plants in particular the green of the aloe vera leaves changed to red and the rosette closed as a result of abiotic stress which was more obvious with lasm treatments the total solid content of the gel from the most stressed plants increased significantly reaching up to 100 the synthesis of not only mannose rich polymers but also of aloin was induced by the abiotic stress with salinity having a stronger effect than water stress most of the positive qualities attributed to aloe vera gel are thought to be the result of these bioactive compounds on the other hand pectin content showed a decrease as a result of the abiotic stress which was more apparent when lasm treatments were applied it is important to emphasize that salinity rather than water stress showed a greater impact on the carbohydrate composition of the polysaccharides found in aloe vera gel the structural architecture and topology of the aloe vera polysaccharides as well as the functional properties related to these compounds may be altered as a result of changes in the composition of the polymers overall the observed increase in these bioactive compounds enhanced the values of the functional properties to enhance the retention of water inside the parenchymatous tissue when water availability is scarce due to salinity may require the modification of the structure and composition of aloe vera gel polysaccharides this could lead to an increase in the values of the functional properties related to the hydration process on the other hand the presence of phytochemicals like aloin which act as a biochemical agent to protect the membrane cell from any potentially harmful effects brought on by the abiotic stress may be related to the observed increase not only in antioxidant compounds but also in the dpph radical scavenging capacity nevertheless more studies are required to understand and evaluate the alterations in the metabolic pathways involved in the synthesis of the bioactive polymer acemannan promoted by the water salinity stress assessing its impact on the structural features and chemical composition of this biopolymer a key piece for the development of functional ingredients based on

8893,the aloe vera plant is an important source of bioactive compounds its growing conditions may have a considerable effect on both its physiological and chemical characteristics thus the objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of joint water and salinity stresses water salinity on the main bioactive compounds of the aloe vera gel the colorless inner parenchymatous tissue also known as inner leaf juice and their related functional properties aloe vera plants were treated with two levels of available soil moisture high and low and five levels of salinity 0 20 40 60 and 80 mm nacl plants grown at high available soil moisture without salt concentration were taken as a control hasm 0 total phenolic compounds aloin cell wall polysaccharides and water soluble polymers were the bioactive compounds analyzed along with the antioxidant activity radical scavenging swelling water retention and fat adsorption capacities in general the water salinity stress negatively affected the development and growing process of the plants however it did cause a considerable increase in the total amount of dry matter from 1 0 to 2 1 g 100 g of fresh aloe vera gel this increase was mainly due to the synthesis of new polysaccharides and in particular of water soluble mannose rich polymers composed of mannose galactose and glucose which increased from 194 4 to 345 8 mg g of water soluble material as water salinity stress increased further there was a significant increase in the aloin content from 10 7 to 19 6 mg g of total solid contents from aloe vera gel these changes in the bioactive compounds were reflected in the functional properties studied hydration properties of aloe vera gel such as swelling and water retention capacity exhibited higher values for those plants treated with water deficit and salinity the antioxidant capacity determined by frap and dpph methods was also higher in the gel from stressed plants overall these results show that water salinity stress could be an agricultural strategy for increasing not only the content of bioactive compounds present in the aloe vera gel but also for improving their related functional properties graphical abstract ga1 keywords aloe vera aloin polysaccharides functional properties water and salinity stresses 1 introduction in recent decades aloe vera aloe barbadensis miller a succulent plant belongs to asphodelaceae family has become one of the most important commercialized medicinal plants in the world grace et al 2015 habeeb et al 2007 manokari et al 2021 in fact processing of the aloe vera leaves generated a revenue of 2 4 billion us dollars in 2019 alone an amount which is expected to increase by up to 3 2 billion us dollars from 2020 to 2027 the global market in aloe vera is led by the usa 65 followed by india 10 and china 10 manokari et al 2021 and its exploitation worldwide is mainly due to the wide spectrum of beneficial properties associated with the different bioactive compounds present in this plant baruah et al 2016 martínez burgos et al 2022 minjares fuentes and femenia 2017 in particular two different types of compounds have been considered as the main biologically active compounds of the aloe vera plant on the one hand there is aloin an anthraquinone c glycoside mainly found in the bitter yellow brownish sap like material localized between the inner parenchymatous tissue the inner leaf gel and the rind of the leaf commonly known as aloe latex highly valued by the pharmaceutical industry due to a variety of biological activities including for example the induction of apoptosis in non small cell lung cancer lee et al 2014 antiviral effects borges argáez et al 2019 antipasmodial activity kumar et al 2017b and anti diabetic effects zhong et al 2022 and on the other hand it contains different polysaccharides such as glucomannans which are responsible for some of the beneficial properties attributed to the plant such as radioprotection kumar and kumar 2019 guided bone regeneration deesricharoenkiat et al 2022 or enhancing the osseointegration in dental implants pachimalla et al 2020 among others these water soluble polymers located within the protoplast of the parenchymatous cells of aloe vera leaves are mainly composed of acetylated mannose linked to glucose by β 1 4 glycosidic linkages chokboribal et al 2015 femenia et al 1999 nevertheless the content and composition of these bioactive compounds as well as their related biological activity can be highly influenced not only by the agro climatic conditions kumar et al 2016 2017a 2017b 2017c but also by the different types of agricultural management applied habibi 2018 hazrati et al 2017 kumar et al 2017a minjares fuentes et al 2017a actually with global climate change the use of saline water in irrigation has increased considerably the low availability of water for use in industrial crops combined with the increasing use of saline water in irrigation has resulted in the interaction of two abiotic stresses water deficit and salinity up to day it has been reported that water deficit modified the molecular weight of water soluble polysaccharides of aloe vera minjares fuentes et al 2017a and also that salinity increased the aloin concentration of aloe vera rahi et al 2013 however the potential alterations on these bioactive compounds and its related functional properties promoted by the interaction of water deficit and salinity remain still unknown therefore the main aim of this study was to assess the effect of the combination of water deficit and salinity water salinity stress on aloin content in aloe vera gel and its related antioxidant capacity and on the polysaccharides present in aloe vera gel and their associated functional properties such as swelling water retention capacity and lipid adsorption capacity 2 materials and methods 2 1 plant material aloe vera leaves used as the raw material for gel extraction were supplied by the regional university unit of arid zones from the autonomous university of chapingo durango mexico latitude 23º 54 n and longitude 103º 37 w and 1130 masl the studied leaves of 30 40 cm in length came from forty aloe vera plants subjected to abiotic stress as described below the aloe vera plants which were 1 5 years old were grown in pots with a capacity of 15 kg and a diameter and height of 25 cm and 30 cm respectively the pots contained 10 kg of sandy loam soil with a ph of 7 92 and electrical conductivity of 3 48 ds m which was classified as non saline soil mota ituarte et al 2023 the plants were subjected to abiotic stress conditions particularly combined water and salinity stress conditions hereafter water salinity stress under a shade mesh the shade mesh was utilized as a physical barrier to prevent herbivorous mammals from consuming the aloe plants during the study period the plants received 14 h of sunlight and 10 h of darkness with sunlight serving as the sole source of light the soil was kept at two different levels of available soil moisture high hasm 18 5 2 5 and low lasm 12 5 2 5 that correspond to the field capacity and to the permanent wilting point mota ituarte et al 2023 the irrigation was performed using water with five different saline nacl concentrations 0 20 40 60 and 80 mm murillo amador et al 2014 the soil moisture was monitored using an extech soil moisture meter mo750 nashua new hampshire usa the water salinity stress treatments were carried out during the spring summer april july of 2020 with four repetitions for each treatment at the end of the experiment the visual changes caused by the combination of water deficit and salinity were registered by digital images in order to gain more information about the effect of water salinity stress the digital images of all the stressed aloe vera plants were analyzed using the user free digital image analysis software imagej the color changes in the leaves as a consequence of water salinity stress were analyzed with the rgb measurement plugin while the aperture angle formed by the lateral leaves was measured using the angle function of the imagej software in order to assess the main effects of the abiotic stress on the bioactive compounds present in the aloe vera gel the filets containing the gel were separated from the leaves as described by femenia et al 1999 for the extraction of gel three aloe vera leaves per plant per treatment were selected with a length greater than 30 cm erect and without any mechanical damage whole leaves were washed and the spikes removed before slicing the leaf to separate the epidermis or skin from the filet then the filets were cut into small cubes and crushed before being homogenized in an ultraturrax t18d ika works wilmington nc usa operating at 8000 rpm during 5 min approximately 500 g of homogenized gel was frozen and lyophilized in a laboratory scale freeze dryer labconco freezone triad cascade benchtop

present in the aloe vera gel 2 2 3 identification of aloin by hplc dad in order to obtain more information on changes in the concentration of aloin as a consequence of the water deficit and saline stresses aloe vera gel extracts were submitted to hplc dad analysis aloin from the lyophilized aloe vera gel samples was analyzed by hplc dad according to the methodology previously described by wu et

sample respectively 2 4 analysis of polysaccharides 2 4 1 alcohol insoluble residues airs and isolation of water soluble polysaccharides the airs from lyophilized aloe vera gel were obtained as described by femenia et al 1998 whereas the isolation of water soluble polysaccharides wsp was carried out as described by minjares fuentes et al 2017a with slight modifications the air suspension 500

colorimetry as total uronic acids as previously described by blumenkrantz and asboe hansen 1973 2 5 determination of techno functional properties the techno functional properties determined included hydration properties such as swelling sw and water retention capacity wrc and fat adsorption capacity fac sw and wrc of airs from the lyophilized aloe vera gel samples were measured in a phosphate buffer 1 m ph 6 3 while fac was measured using corn oil as previously described by alvarado morales et al 2019 2 6 statistical analysis the results of total phenolic compounds antioxidant capacity and techno functional properties were statistically analyzed by anova the available soil moisture and nacl concentration were taken as factors and a general linear model was utilized to conduct anova with a statistical significance level of α 0 05 prior to the analysis all data underwent normality testing using the shapiro wilk test with a statistical significance level of α 0 05 the post hoc analysis was performed using the lower significant difference lsd test all statistical analyses were performed in minitab software 3 results and discussion 3 1 visual observations it is well known that abiotic stress might lead to a chain of morphological physiological and biochemical changes which may negatively affect the normal growth of plants jäger and meyer 1977 after temperature water deficit and salinity are probably the main types of abiotic stress factors to which plants can be exposed lucero et al 2017 thus the effect of water stress and salt concentration on the appearance and morphology of the aloe vera plants were analyzed fig 1 the application of water salinity stress had negative effects on the appearance and morphology of the plants in general all the stressed plants presented some browning and reduction of the foliar area in particular the plants treated with low available soil moisture lasm fig 1f j exhibited leaf wedging leaf grooving and apex necrosis it is important to highlight that these effects were also observed in those plants cultivated using high available soil moisture and nacl concentration of 80 mm hasm 80 these observations agree with those observed by garcía rodríguez et al 2014 who investigated the growth of aloe vera under different concentrations of nacl these authors reported that plant growth was affected by salinity decreasing the number of new leaves fresh and dry biomass and increasing the necrotic basal leaves dehydration and root necrosis more recently salinas et al 2019 who studied the changes in the morphology of aloe vera aloe barbadensis miller as consequence of water stress observed a decrease in fresh weight and thickness as well as changes in leaf pigmentation in this case the alterations in the morphology and appearance of the aloe vera plants could be the result not only by the water restriction and salinity garcía rodríguez et al 2014 but also by the accumulation of na in the soil which has been considered toxic for the vegetal tissue and one of the most important factor responsible for the growth reduction of plants jin et al 2007 interestingly both stresses water and salinity significantly affected the green color of the leaves while the red and or blue were only affected by salinity p 0 05 table 1 it is important to note that in most plants the green color is mainly attributed to chlorophyll whereas the red and blue have been attributed to the presence of anthocyanins hazrati et al 2016 in particular the green color values varied from 77 3 up to 105 for aloe vera plants subjected to hasm those plants grown at below 20 mm of salinity being those with the highest values however aloe vera plants grown under lasm salinity exhibited green color values ranging from 56 to 91 in this case the highest and lowest values corresponded to aloe vera plants treated with 40 and 80 mm respectively table 1 with regard to the red and blue colors of the aloe vera leaves red values ranged from 71 up to 108 whereas blue ranged from 41 to 72 representing the lowest and highest values from plants grown under lasm 80 and lasm 40 respectively it has been observed that water stress and high light intensity leads to a reduction of chlorophyll in the aloe vera leaves and increases the biosynthesis of anthocyanins which have been considered as sunscreen pigments involved in the protection of the leaf ultrastructure from photo oxidative damage delatorre castillo et al 2022 hazrati et al 2016 likewise it has been observed that salinity may cause the greenness of the amaranthus lividus leaves to turn into red blue as the stress conditions increase this is most likely because of a drastic reduction of chlorophyll since salinity increases the chlorophyllase activity affecting the membrane stability and also weakening the protein pigment lipid complex hossain et al 2022 on the other hand as can be seen in fig 1 the water salinity caused the leaves of the stressed plants to fold this being more noticeable when salinity increased under lasm conditions in fact those aloe vera plants grown under hasm exhibited a rosette form wider than in the case of the aloe plants grown under lasm this observation was related to the angle formed between the lateral leaves in particular the angle from plants grown under hasm ranged from 36 to 60 with plants cultivated under hasm 20 conditions showing the widest rosette whereas for those plants grown under lasm the angle ranged from 28 to 42 the lowest angle observed corresponding to lasm 20 conditions see table 1 the fold of aloe vera leaves has been seen as a defense mechanism against adverse environmental conditions when availability of water becomes very limited which implies the reduction of the evaporative surface of leaf since the adaxial surface receives more solar radiation than the abaxial surface delatorre castillo et al 2022 3 2 total solid contents of aloe vera gel from an industrial point of view the total solid or dry matter content of aloe vera gel plays a critical role in the manufacturing process of aloe vera based products since it is directly related to the content of bioactive compounds and it should be a key parameter to be taken into account during the processing of aloe vera gel minjares fuentes et al 2016 2017b thus the percentage of total solids present in the aloe vera gel was determined in order to evaluate a possible dehydration of the plant as a consequence of the abiotic stress conditions applied the water salinity stress led to significant changes in the percentage of dry matter p 0 05 fig 2 the percentage of dry matter increased as the salinity concentration was augmented this was more noticeable in the gel from those plants cultivated with lasm particularly aloe vera gel from plants grown at lasm 80 exhibited the highest content of dry matter 2 1 these results are in agreement with those of minjares fuentes et al 2017a who observed that dry matter content of aloe vera mucilage increased when water restriction increased further it has been observed that the increase of dry matter in those plants grown under severe stress conditions may be due to the synthesis of secondary metabolites known as osmolytes performing the osmotic adjustment kerepesi and galiba 2000 this response contributes to maintaining cell volume and turgidity avoiding cell dehydration stabilizing and protecting the structure of membranes rhodes et al 2002 3 3 total phenolic compounds tpc a considerable part of the beneficial properties associated with aloe vera have been attributed to the presence of phenolic compounds minjares fuentes and femenia 2019 thus the tpc of aloe vera gel cultivated under water salinity stress conditions were determined as can be seen in table 2 the tpc of the aloe vera gel were significantly affected by water salinity stress p 0 05 the content of tpc varied from 4 8 to 7 9 mg gae g total solid content presents in the aloe vera gel as a consequence of the different treatments applied in particular the gel from those plants grown at hasm 60 treatment showed the highest tpc content being 25 higher in comparison to the control treatment hasm 0 6 3 mg gae g total solid contents interestingly the gel from those plants irrigated with lasm 40 and lasm 60 exhibited the lowest tpc content of 5 25 0 19 and 4 85 0 14 mg gae g total solid contents presents in the aloe vera gel respectively it is also notable that the tpc contents observed in this study are lower than those reported by kumar et al 2017a who analyzed the phenolic compounds content of aloe vera plants from six different agro climatic zones from india these authors observed that tpc ranged from 32 to 66 mg gae g dm the highest concentration being obtained from plants from highland and semi arid agro climatic regions further it has been observed that moderate drought promotes an increase of phenolic compounds in the aloe vera plant habibi 2018 it is important to highlight that the age of aloe vera plants plays a key role in regulating the tpc in the gel hu et al 2003 interestingly it has been observed that the highest phenolic content was higher in 3 year old plants than either in 2 or 4 year old plants ray et al 2013 it is important to point out that plants under different stress conditions may increase the production of phytochemicals with antioxidant capacity such as phenolic compounds flavonoids anthocyanins among others in order to protect the cell membrane delatorre castillo et al 2022 hossain et al 2022 kumar et al 2017c in fact it has been reported that aloe vera grown under water deficit conditions and subjected to high intensity light conditions increases the biosynthesis of anthocyanins to protect the chloroplasts from photo inhibition caused by the ultraviolet radiation resulting in the change of the leaf color from greenness to redness delatorre castillo et al 2022 hazrati et al 2016 3 4 antioxidant activity aa and radical scavenging capacity rsc the water salinity stress also had a significant effect on the aa measured by the abts and frap assays as well as on the rsc determined by the dpph assay p 0 05 table 2 as can be observed the abiotic stress promoted a considerable variation in the aa determined by the frap assay ranging from 2 76 mg te g total solid contents from aloe vera gel for those plants subjected to the highest stress conditions lasm 80 up to 5 65 mg te g total solid contents of gel for aloe vera plants treated under low available soil moisture without nacl lasm 0 further although differences were significant the aa values determined by the abts method exhibited less variation among the different aloe vera gel samples ranging from 5 47 to 5 76 mg te g total solid contents from aloe vera gel on the other hand the radical scavenging capacity determined by the dpph assay exhibited a considerable variation in particular the percentage of dpph radical inhibition ranged from 26 7 up to 44 9 for aloe vera gel from plants treated with hasm whereas for the gel from those plants cultivated using lasm the percentage of inhibition ranged from 23 4 up to 45 4 previously habibi 2018 evaluated the effect of mild and moderate drought stress on the production of phenolic compounds and the phytochemical activity of aloe vera in particular the inhibitory capacity of dpph radical was evaluated for 180 days and the highest percentage of inhibition was found under mild stress conditions similarly it has been reported that aloe plants grown in highland and semi arid zones exhibit higher antioxidant activity dpph inhibition 60 than plants grown in tropical zones which has been attributed to higher production of different bioactive compounds kumar et al 2017c it has been observed that stress conditions increase the production of phytochemicals although the individual content of these compounds can vary depending on the growing environment conditions kumar et al 2017c interestingly these percentages of inhibition are higher than those found in the present study which could be attributed to the age of the plants analyzed since it has been pointed out that the age of the plant has great influence on the antioxidant capacity of the aloe vera compounds the highest values being obtained in 3 year old plants ray et al 2013 therefore it is important to highlight that changes in the antioxidant activity of aloe vera promoted by abiotic stress seems to be limited in the case of 2 year old plants the international aloe science council https www iasc org has defined the aloe vera as a 6 to 8 year crop which is considered productive at 1 5 years old expecting a production of around 11 kg of leaves per plant per year however if the aloe vera plant begins to show premature desiccation and browning leaves as a consequence of the agro climatic conditions including abiotic stress the harvest can be considerably reduced delatorre castillo et al 2022 mota ituarte et al 2023 therefore it is important to implement good agricultural strategies such as a more efficient water management in order to improve the production of bioactive substances from aloe vera plants which in turn will increase its commercial value 3 5 aloin content aloin one of the main bioactive compounds of the aloe vera plant has been used as a taxonomic marker for species of this genus minjares fuentes and femenia 2019 saccù et al 2001 the combination of water stress and salinity had a significant effect on the aloin content fig 3 as can be seen the content of aloin in aloe vera gel varied from 11 to 20 mg g total solid contents from aloe vera gel depending on the irrigation treatment applied interestingly the water deficit as well as the increase in salinity promoted a higher content of this compound p 0 05 particularly the aloin content in the gel from those plants treated at high available soil moisture hasm increased from 10 7 up to 17 4 mg g total solid contents from aloe vera gel when salinity increased from 0 to 60 mm nacl on the contrary at low available soil moisture lasm aloin content decreased from 19 5 to 13 7 mg g total solid contents from aloe vera gel when salinity increased from 40 to 60 mm nacl it is also worth noting that the highest aloin content was observed at low available soil moisture when salinity ranged from 0 to 40 mm nacl the increase in the concentration of aloin in aloe vera due to abiotic stress has been widely reported by different authors hazrati et al 2017 khajeeyan et al 2021 rahimi dehgolan et al 2012 in fact hazrati et al 2017 and khajeeyan et al 2021 who studied the influence of water stress on the aloin content of aloe vera plants reported that it increased as water stress increased on the other hand it has been observed that succulent plants like aloe vera growing in sodic soils are able to sequester higher amounts of co2 as a response in order to compensate the water deficit caused by sodicity rahi et al 2013 further the sequestered co2 is fixed through the calvin cycle during the night and converted into carbohydrates and organic acids which are then used to synthetize high concentrations of various types of osmoprotectants precursors of secondary metabolites through photosynthetic cycles which in turn are able to protect the plant against potential environmental stresses leonardos and grodzinski 2017 rahi et al 2013 thus the increase of the aloin content in aloe vera gel could be the result of the physiological and biochemical response of the plant to the abiotic stress caused by low availability of water as a consequence of the increasing soil salinity the increase of aloin content under stress conditions has been considered as a defense mechanism against external factors since aloin plays a key role in controlling the evapotranspiration process when aloe plants are in heatstroke and under severe drought conditions hazrati et al 2017 khajeeyan et al 2021 rahi et al 2013 sepúlveda jiménez et al 2003 3 6 polysaccharides aloe vera polysaccharides comprising 60 of solid material are not only the predominant bioactive compounds of aloe vera gel but also are considered to be mainly responsible for most of the beneficial properties associated to aloe vera gel chokboribal et al 2015 femenia et al 1999 kumar and kumar 2019 salah et al 2019 for this reason the effect of hydric and saline stress on the main polysaccharides present in aloe vera gel was evaluated thus the carbohydrate composition of the alcohol insoluble residues air s and also of the water soluble polysaccharides wsp extracted from aloe vera gel was determined tables 2 and 3 respectively 3 6 1 airs carbohydrate composition as can be observed in table 3 air s fractions exhibited yields between 32 7 and 49 3 percentage expressed as g air 100 g dry matter these results are higher than those reported by minjares fuentes et al 2017a when assessing the influence of water deficit in the carbohydrate content of aloe vera the carbohydrate analysis revealed that uronic acids ua were the most abundant monosaccharides in all samples followed by mannose and glucose small amounts of galactose xylose arabinose fucose and rhamnose were also determined it is important to note that most of the carbohydrate monomers present in the airs from aloe vera gel were significantly affected by salinity p 0 05 with mannose being the most affected 94 160 mg g air while the available soil moisture had a significant effect on the contents of galactose 26 66 mg g air glucose 91 123 mg g air and uronic acids 234 426 mg g air p 0 05 table 3 the content of high concentrations of uronic acids and low amounts of galactose arabinose and rhamnose are indicative of the presence of pectins which are the predominant type of polymer of the cell walls of aloe vera femenia et al 1999 mcconaughy et al 2008 while the presence of mannose units could be indicative of the occurrence of the acemannan polysaccharide femenia et al 1999 mcanalley 1993 minjares fuentes et al 2017a although femenia et al 1999 found mannose containing polysaccharides as the predominant polymers in the aloe vera gel the predominance of pectic substances has previously been reported by several authors mandal and das 1980 minjares fuentes et al 2017a ovodova et al 1975 in this study such predominance could be attributed to the dehydration process promoted by the water salinity stress it is also important to note that the highest mannose content was observed in the airs from the gel of aloe vera plants grown at lasm 80 supporting the idea that abiotic conditions may induce the biosynthesis of the acemannan polymer this fact may improve the water management inside the parenchymatous tissues in order to maintain essential functions of the aloe vera plant when water is restricted ahl et al 2019 femenia et al 1999 minjares fuentes et al 2017a on the other hand pectic substances were the cell wall polymer most affected by the hydric saline stress as could be inferred from the variation in the uronic acid amounts present in the different samples interestingly the pectin content of plants treated under hasm was higher than the plants under lasm the hasm 60 treatment being that which exhibited the greatest amount of pectic substances it has been proposed that mannans and pectins play a key role in the transport of water from parenchyma to chlorenchyma when plants are under stress conditions although the mechanisms involved in this phenomenon are still unclear delatorre castillo et al 2022 xing et al 2022 finally the considerable amounts of glucose suggest the presence of cellulose while the small amounts of xylose and fucose could be associated with the presence of hemicellulosic polymers in particular xyloglucans ahl et al 2019 femenia et al 1999 minjares fuentes et al 2017a these polysaccharides were almost not affected by the water salinity stress this latter observation is in agreement with the work of minjares fuentes et al 2017a this result supports the idea that aloe vera xyloglucans polysaccharides may play a critical role in the scaffold forming of cell walls together with cellulose ahl et al 2019 nevertheless further structural studies are required in order to identify possible alterations to these cell wall forming polymers under abiotic stress 3 6 2 water soluble polysaccharides wsp a previous study showed that wsp present in aloe vera gel were severely affected by water deficit minjares fuentes et al 2017a however there is no information on the effect of salinity neither on the combination of water salinity stress on the chemical composition of wsp present in aloe vera gel as can be seen in table 4 the yields of wsp fractions presented a considerable variation p 0 05 ranging from 11 to 18 g wsp 100 g dry matter in all the samples mannose was the most abundant monosaccharide followed by notable amounts of uronic acids and glucose to a lesser extent monosaccharides such as galactose xylose arabinose fucose and rhamnose were also detected the high concentration of mannose units together with smaller amounts of glucose in the wsp fractions suggests the presence of the acemannan polysaccharide identified as the main polysaccharide present in aloe vera gel by several authors femenia et al 1999 mcanalley 1993 minjares fuentes et al 2017a interestingly in all the aloe vera samples salinity greatly increased the concentration of mannose in comparison with the control treatment hasm 0 in particular the treatment with the highest stress level i e lasm 80 showed the highest increase in mannose reaching up to 300 60 mg man g wsp similarly glucose increased from 15 75 mg g in the control treatment to 35 68 mg g in the lasm 80 sample the increase in the acemannan polysaccharide as a consequence of water deficit has been previously reported by various authors ahl et al 2019 delatorre herrera et al 2010 minjares fuentes et al 2017a quezada et al 2017 although there are no reports of such an increase due to the combination of water deficit and salinity this increase could be considered as a response mechanism to the abiotic stress applied enhancing the water retention into cells in order to avoid dehydration of the tissues delatorre herrera et al 2010 on the contrary minjares fuentes et al 2017a who studied the effect of water deficit 0 40 and 60 on the composition of the main polysaccharides of aloe vera gel observed a significant decrease in the acemannan polymer when the water deficit increased from 0 to 60 these authors suggested that acemannan was probably metabolized by the plant as a defense mechanism against abiotic stress the low molecular weight fractions being the most affected minjares fuentes et al 2017a on the other hand the presence of considerable amounts of uronic acids in the wsp fractions is indicative of pectic polysaccharides similar results were observed by femenia et al 1999 and minjares fuentes et al 2017a when analyzing the water soluble fraction of aloe vera gel these authors proposed that pectic polysaccharides present in water soluble fractions could be released from the middle lamella and not from the cell walls femenia et al 1999 minjares fuentes et al 2017a 3 7 techno functional properties the functional properties related to polysaccharides depend not only on their chemical composition but also on the way these polymers are interconnected to form the three dimensional structures jarvis 2011 it is well known that techno functional properties of aloe vera such as retention of water and oil adsorption are mainly related to the concentration type and composition of polysaccharides alvarado morales et al 2019 chokboribal et al 2015 minjares fuentes et al 2017b rodríguez gonzález et al 2011 however there is no information about the modification of these properties as a consequence of polysaccharide alterations caused by water salinity stress therefore the effect of different stress levels on the techno functional properties of the air s fractions obtained from the aloe vera gel was evaluated fig 4 water salinity stress had significant effects p 0 05 on the different properties evaluated such as swelling sw water retention capacity wrc and oil adsorption capacity fac as can be observed in fig 4a sw values ranged from 56 1 to 84 4 ml g air interestingly those plants treated with abundant irrigation hasm exhibited higher sw values than plants treated with water deficit lasm particularly sw from hasm plants showed an increase of between 30 and 40 in relation to the control sample 63 ml g air on the other hand no significant differences were observed between lasm and the control plant except for samples corresponding to lasm 80 plants which exhibited a sw value of 80 ml g air changes in sw values due to external factors have previously been observed by several authors alvarado morales et al 2019 femenia et al 2003 rodríguez gonzález et al 2011 previous reports have shown that sw of aloe vera gel can vary from 40 ml g up to 70 ml g or even up to 150 ml g when the aloe vera gel was processed either by convective drying femenia et al 2003 or thermosonication alvarado morales et al 2019 nevertheless rodriguez gonzalez et al 2012 who studied the effect of pasteurization on functional properties observed that the sw of pasteurized aloe vera gel reached values even higher than 300 ml g air the ability of polysaccharide rich materials to swell has widely been associated with the reduction of cholesterol levels in blood elleuch et al 2011 mackie et al 2016 mudgil and barak 2013 regarding wrc water stress and salinity also had a significant effect on this property p 0 05 see fig 4b as can be seen wrc values showed a wide variation from 28 to 75 g h2o g air aloe vera plants treated with hasm 0 exhibited a wrc of 59 98 1 14 g h2o g air interestingly the water restriction led to a significant increase of wrc when salinity increased from 0 to 40 mm nacl reaching values of up to 75 g h2o g air p 0 05 these wrc values are higher than those previously reported by other authors for example rodríguez gonzález et al 2011 reported values between 22 1 and 27 9 g h2o g air when aloe vera gel was pasteurized at 65 c for 25 min and 75 c for 25 min respectively further alvarado morales et al 2019 who assessed the impact of the thermosonication process on the functional properties found wrc values comprising between 30 and 50 g h2o g air these authors suggested that low wrc could be attributed to the occurrence of water soluble low molecular weight polysaccharide rich material in the thermosonicated aloe vera gel finally the results of the effect of water stress and salinity in the fac of aloe vera samples are showed in fig 4c as can be seen abiotic stress due to water deficit and salinity had a significant but limited effect on fac from aloe vera gel p 0 05 the gel from those aloe vera plants taken as a control hasm 0 showed a fac value of 42 34 1 82 g oil g air interestingly lasm 40 and lasm 80 samples exhibited the highest fac values 46 g oil g air whereas the rest of the samples showed a significant reduction of between 10 and 15 in comparison to the control sample these results are slightly higher than those reported by rodríguez gonzález et al 2011 who observed fac values between 32 and 35 g oil g air in pasteurized aloe vera gel on the contrary alvarado morales et al 2019 reported an increase in the fac when aloe vera was thermosonicated at 50 c for 6 min reaching values of up to 120 g oil g air the effect of water salinity stress on the concentration and potential structural modifications of the polysaccharides present in the aloe vera gel could be responsible for the observed variations in the functional properties determined in this study 4 conclusions the present study focused on the impact of the combination of water and salinity stress on the main bioactive compounds of the aloe vera gel and its related functional properties as expected the abiotic stress caused by water deficit and salinity affected negatively the appearance of the aloe plants in particular the green of the aloe vera leaves changed to red and the rosette closed as a result of abiotic stress which was more obvious with lasm treatments the total solid content of the gel from the most stressed plants increased significantly reaching up to 100 the synthesis of not only mannose rich polymers but also of aloin was induced by the abiotic stress with salinity having a stronger effect than water stress most of the positive qualities attributed to aloe vera gel are thought to be the result of these bioactive compounds on the other hand pectin content showed a decrease as a result of the abiotic stress which was more apparent when lasm treatments were applied it is important to emphasize that salinity rather than water stress showed a greater impact on the carbohydrate composition of the polysaccharides found in aloe vera gel the structural architecture and topology of the aloe vera polysaccharides as well as the functional properties related to these compounds may be altered as a result of changes in the composition of the polymers overall the observed increase in these bioactive compounds enhanced the values of the functional properties to enhance the retention of water inside the parenchymatous tissue when water availability is scarce due to salinity may require the modification of the structure and composition of aloe vera gel polysaccharides this could lead to an increase in the values of the functional properties related to the hydration process on the other hand the presence of phytochemicals like aloin which act as a biochemical agent to protect the membrane cell from any potentially harmful effects brought on by the abiotic stress may be related to the observed increase not only in antioxidant compounds but also in the dpph radical scavenging capacity nevertheless more studies are required to understand and evaluate the alterations in the metabolic pathways involved in the synthesis of the bioactive polymer acemannan promoted by the water salinity stress assessing its impact on the structural features and chemical composition of this biopolymer a key piece for the development of functional ingredients based on

8894,predicting water quality and quantity response to climate change in a watershed is very difficult due to the complexity and uncertainties in estimating and understanding future hydrological conditions however hydrological models could simplify the processes and predict future impacts of agricultural activities this study aimed to evaluate the applicability of the soil water assessment tool swat model for climate change prediction of streamflow and nitrate load in an agricultural mediterranean watershed in northern spain the model was first evaluated for simulating streamflow and nitrate load under rainfed agricultural conditions in the cidacos river watershed in navarre spain then climate change impact analysis on streamflow and nitrate load was conducted in the short term 2011 2040 medium term 2041 2070 and long term 2071 2100 future projections relative to the historical baseline period 1971 2000 under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 co2 emission scenarios the model evaluation showed a good model performance result during calibration 2000 2010 and validation 2011 2020 for streamflow nse 0 82 0 83 and nitrate load nse 0 71 0 68 indicating its suitability for adoption in the watershed the climate change projection results showed a steady decline in streamflow and nitrate load for rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 in all projections with the long term projection scenario of rcp8 5 greatly affected autumn and winter saw a considerable drop in comparison to spring and summer the decline in streamflow was attributed to the projected decrease in precipitation and increase in temperatures while the nitrate load decline was consistent with the projected streamflow decline based on these projections the long term projection scenarios of rcp8 5 indicate dire situations requiring urgent policy changes and management interventions to minimize and mitigate the resulting climate change effects therefore adapted agricultural management practices are needed to ensure sustainable water resource utilization and efficient nitrogen fertilizer application rates in the watershed to reduce pollution graphical abstract ga1 keywords future projection nitrate load rainfed agriculture swat model water quality data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction agriculture is one of the most important sectors of any regional or national economy globally it is the primary source of livelihood and the backbone of most nations economic systems with more than 60 of the world population directly dependent on it fao 2017 however agricultural intensification puts great pressure on available water resources and the environment potentially causing damage these damages could range from soil erosion which is much more common in agricultural environments than in other soil uses garcía ruiz et al 2015 almagro et al 2016 boardman and poesen 2006 to water quality degradation caused by non point source pollution chahor et al 2014 giménez et al 2012 merchán et al 2018 sutton et al 2011 studies conducted within the navarre region of northern spain have identified considerable nitrate and phosphate concentrations in streams in cereal crop areas where the recommended thresholds are often exceeded albeit with seasonal and annual variability casalí et al 2008 hernández garcía et al 2020 merchán et al 2019 the cidacos river watershed in the navarre region has diverse land uses with rainfed agriculture predominating the watershed holds decades worth of nitrate concentration discharge and meteorological data collected by the government of navarre at various stations hence ideal for conducting investigations on agricultural activities impact on the quality and quantity of water resources in the area some of the challenges associated with agricultural practices in the study area are nitrate pollution in surface waters as evidenced by high nitrate concentration levels in the cidacos river merchán et al 2020 and anticipated climate change effects due to projected changes in temperature and precipitation affecting the cropping system funes et al 2016 trnka et al 2011 climate change impacts on water resources can be quantified by using various global or regional climate models gcms or rcms and future radiative forcing scenarios known as representative concentration pathways rcps to establish appropriate adaptation measures and policy interventions krysanova et al 2017 the mediterranean region particularly spain is considered to be highly vulnerable to climate change effects due to its geographical location and the imbalance between the available water resources and the current demands vargas amelin and pindado 2014 furthermore most climate change model projections for spain indicate an increase in temperature and a decrease in precipitation by the end of the 21st century candela et al 2012 chirivella osma et al 2015 estrela et al 2012 majone et al 2012 somot et al 2008 climate change is expected to affect all aspects of the environment compounding agricultural effects on streamflow and nitrate exportation arora 2019 for instance a change in streamflow due to projected temperature and precipitation changes would result in extreme events such as droughts or floods these events would in turn influence the nitrate dynamics in the watershed by changing the exported nitrate loads and concentration accumulated in the soils and water therefore it is important to investigate the potential effects of climate change on streamflow and nitrate dynamics as they would impair the current hydrological conditions and hinder the achievement of nitrate standards as stipulated by the european water framework directive european communities 2000 nitrate pollution is a global concern that affects water quality by making it unsafe for human consumption who 2017 and increases eutrophication sutton et al 2011 nitrate pollution contributors on a watershed could include agriculture livestock and aquaculture casalí et al 2008 fao iwmi 2018 menció et al 2016 whilst some level of nitrate exportation is inevitable in agricultural areas improved management practices could limit its effect on streams beaudoin et al 2005 boithias et al 2014 cameron et al 2013 to address nitrate pollution challenge the european commission has established policy legislations such as the nitrate directive nd directive 91 676 eec and the european water framework directive wfd directive 2000 60 eec to protect water bodies from agricultural nitrate pollution with a nitrate concentration threshold of 50 mg l 1 for european rivers european communities 1991 however more research is needed to understand the spatial and temporal interactions of water quality variables and quantify the loads to assess their climate change impacts mathematical models are fundamental tools for hydrological and environmental planning with their greatest potential being the ability to generate scenarios in the face of voluntary or imposed changes in land use or management the soil water assessment tool swat model is one of the best available tools for simulating the response of agricultural or non agricultural watersheds to water quality the swat model has been widely used by water resources experts to understand the characteristics of a watershed and predict its hydrological response to external climate and internal water management land management etc drivers and their impacts the swat model has been applied in the mediterranean region and particularly spain for streamflow analysis harraki et al 2021 jimeno sáez et al 2018 meaurio et al 2015 and water quality assessment of nitrogen and nitrates epelde et al 2015 zabaleta et al 2014 zettam et al 2020 the majority of nitrate studies conducted by the swat model focus on how to reduce nitrate pollution through land use changes ferrant et al 2011 wang et al 2008 as well as regulating fertilizer application rates and other management practices like tillage boithias et al 2014 cerro et al 2014 ferrant et al 2011 liu et al 2013 despite several studies on streamflow and hydrological response to climate change there has been very little research on the effects of climate change on water quality ficklin et al 2010 luz rodríguez blanco et al 2019 martínková et al 2011 molina navarro et al 2014 moreover there are no long term climate change assessments of the effects of agricultural activities on streamflow and water quality in the navarre region this study aimed to evaluate the swat model s applicability for climate change prediction of streamflow and nitrate load in a rainfed agricultural mediterranean watershed in northern spain the model was first evaluated for its capacity to simulate streamflow and nitrate export under rainfed agricultural conditions in the upper reaches of the cidacos river watershed and then used to assess the climate change impacts by comparing future projections to the historical baseline under two emission scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 the findings from this study could provide valuable information on climate change adaptation and mitigation measures in the future and deepen the knowledge on nitrate exportation and pollution in the study area 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the cidacos river is one of the tributaries of the aragón river which is a tributary of the ebro river it is located approximately 15 km south of pamplona the capital of the chartered community of navarre in spain at latitudes 42 69 and 42 34 north and longitudes 1 72 and 1 47 west the cidacos river drains a watershed area of 477 km2 and runs north south with an approximate length of 44 km and width of 15 km in its widest section fig 1 the watershed s headwater is somewhat mountainous in the north with high altitudes of slightly over 1000 m above sea level but then crosses down to slightly uneven to low terrain of approximately 300 m above sea level in the south at the river s mouth in traibuenas where it joins the aragón river the watershed s climate is humid to dry temperate mild mediterranean with cold winters monthly average 4 7 ⁰c to 5 4 ⁰c in january and warm summers monthly average 21 2 ⁰c to 23 7 ⁰c in august that vary spatially from north to south the annual average temperature ranges from 12 2 ⁰c to 14 2 ⁰c north to south the watershed receives annual precipitation from 800 mm in the north to 400 mm in the south characterized by strong inter annual variability and high summer aridity the wettest months are april and may merchán et al 2020 agriculture is the predominant land use in the watershed accounting for 53 of the total area fig 2a other major land uses in the watershed include forests 25 and pasture and bushlands 17 the remaining 5 comprises urban residential areas built up land bare land and water bodies rainfed agriculture covers 176 km2 37 of the total area and 70 of cultivated land and is primarily in the watershed s upper reaches until olite town irrigated land on the other hand covers 77 km2 16 of the total area and 30 of the cultivated land and is largely in the watershed s lower reaches the main crops grown are rainfed winter cereals wheat and barley and vineyards orchard other crops grown in small quantities include corn tomatoes and potatoes the average annual fertilizer application rates range from 80 to 130 kg n ha 1 for winter cereals and 40 50 kg n ha 1 for vineyards oduor et al 2023 the most abundant soil textures in the watershed are loam and clay loam which are found in most agricultural areas while loamy sand and sandy loam soils are found on eroded hillslopes red clay soils dominate the watershed with sandstone and mudstones according to the fao classification system iuss working group wrb 2015 the watershed s predominant soil types are haplic calciols soils 51 6 fluvic camisols soils 26 1 which are mostly found along the river network path and alaric regosols 18 haplic phaeozem 1 7 calcic castanea s 1 6 fluvic phaeozem 0 4 eutric fluvisols 0 3 and dystric cambisols 0 2 are among the other soils found in the watershed fig 2b 2 2 description of the swat model the swat model is an open source software developed by the united states department of agriculture s agricultural research service usda ars to help water resource managers policy experts and decision makers predict and quantify the impact of land use management on water and diffuse pollution in small and large watersheds with varying soil types land use and management practices neitsch et al 2011 swat is a data driven semi distributed continuous timescale physical and process based hydrological model that simulates water sediments and agricultural chemicals or pollutant yields the swat simulation process divides the watershed s hydrology into land and routing phases in the land phase the water sediment and nutrient balances are calculated for each hydrological response unit hru whereas in the routing phase the hru outputs are aggregated and routed through the channel network to the outlet of the watershed arnold et al 2012 the hru consists of a unique homogeneous combination of similar land use soil type and topography characteristics neitsch et al 2011 the water balance equation simulates the watershed s hydrological component arnold et al 2012 neitsch et al 2011 the organic and mineral nitrogen cycles are simulated in swat by dividing the nutrients in the soil into organic and inorganic parts and component pools which can increase or decrease depending on the transformation and additions or losses occurring within each pool green and van griensven 2008 the movement and transformation of various forms of nitrogen within a watershed are introduced into the main channel through surface runoff and lateral subsurface flow and transported downstream with the flow arabi et al 2008 2 3 data acquisition the swat model requires geospatial and hydrometeorological input data variables the data for this study were primarily obtained from the government of navarre agencies and websites as shown in table 1 the climate data were obtained at a daily time step from 12 weather stations both manual and automatic located within and near the watershed from 1990 to 2020 the selected stations represented the spatial heterogeneity of the watershed s climate the meteorological data included daily data of precipitation mm maximum and minimum daily temperatures c solar radiation mj m 2 s 2 wind speed m s 1 and relative humidity data the agricultural management information which included planting and harvesting dates the average annual fertilizer application rates and the main crops cultivated in the watershed were obtained from intia s technical team and extension advisors who conduct field interviews in consultation with key informants such as farmers within the watershed see table s1 the monthly observed streamflow data and nitrate loads from 2000 to 2020 were used for the model evaluation the data used were obtained from the olite gauging station since it was the only station in the watershed with consistent and extensive long term data of observed discharge and nitrate concentration data as it has been operational since 1988 and covers the watershed area under rainfed agriculture 2 4 the swat model set up and run the model set up was preceded by preparing and processing the necessary spatial datasets such as dem soil and land use grid maps and discharge outlet points on the qgis 3 18 interphase the model was set up in the qswat3 1 1 1 interphase by performing watershed delineation hru creation input editing and running the swat model the watershed was delineated using the dem and the cidacos river shapefile until the outlet at traibuenas discretization was done using a minimum area threshold of 10 km2 required to create streams resulting in a watershed area of 477 02 km2 with 23 sub watersheds a slope elevation band of 0 5 5 10 and 10 and above was provided to the model the watershed s overall elevation ranged from 315 m to 1150 m with an average elevation of 560 m by overlaying the lulc and soil grid maps and using a 5 threshold for land uses soil type and slope values 1404 hrus were generated this threshold was chosen to eliminate minor land uses soils and slopes in each sub watershed facilitating model processing by improving its performance speed and efficiency using the swat editor the weather data and agricultural management information were added to the model 2 5 sensitivity analysis calibration and validation the swat calibration and uncertainty procedures swatcup version 5 1 6 a standalone software was used to perform sensitivity analysis calibration and validation of the model the multi site sequential uncertainty fitting version 2 sufi 2 a semi automated inverse modeling routine procedure of swatcup was used in this study the model was run 500 times for each iteration and the parameter sensitivity was determined by performing a global sensitivity analysis in which all parameters changed simultaneously multiple regression computations were used to identify the most sensitive parameters the latin hypercube generated parameters are regressed against the objective function values in this system abbaspour 2015 the t test was used to determine the relative significance of each parameter the p values and t stat indices were used to assess the sensitivity of the parameters the parameter was more sensitive when the p value was lower and vice versa the best combination for obtaining the most sensitive parameter is a very small p value and a large t value absolute parameters that had p values less than 0 05 were deemed highly sensitive the parameter sensitivity was ranked using the t stat index and the p value to identify the most sensitive parameters that had the greatest impact on the model outputs arnold et al 2012 larger parameter uncertainties were initially assumed to ensure that most observed data fell within the 95 prediction uncertainty 95ppu band abbaspour et al 2018 95ppu accounts for all the uncertainties within the model combined the parameter ranges were adjusted after every iteration run during the calibration phase until most of the observed data were bracketed in the 95ppu band the model was deemed satisfactory when more than 50 of the observed flow data were bracketed within the 95ppu the model was run from 1990 to 2020 with the first ten years 1990 1999 serving as the warm up period to allow the model to reach an optimal state before reading the outputs the model was then evaluated over the remaining period 2000 2020 which was divided into calibration 2000 2010 and validation 2011 2020 phases the streamflow parameters were first satisfactorily calibrated and fixed before calibrating the nitrate parameters the calibration parameters were chosen from the abundant existing literature on streamflow and nitrate calibration using the swat model in the mediterranean region abbaspour 2015 abbaspour et al 2018 2015 kamali et al 2017 kouchi et al 2017 rouholahnejad et al 2014 to change the parameter values in swat three methods parameter qualifiers are used r which refers to a relative change of the specified parameter that increases or decreases the existing swat parameter value by multiplying it by 1 fitted value to obtain the new parameter value v which refers to value change or replacement which means that the initial swat parameter value is to be directly replaced by the fitted value and a which refers to addition and means that the fitted value is added to the initial swat parameter value after the sensitivity analysis the final streamflow and nitrate load calibration parameters were chosen the model results were presented graphically on the hydrograph plots for the simulated and observed values during the calibration and validation periods the model s performance was evaluated using the commonly used statistical performance indicator techniques for hydrological modeling moriasi et al 2007 have recommended the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse the coefficient of determination r2 the root mean square error to the standard deviation of observed data ratio rsr and the percent bias pbias as the most suitable quantitative statistical techniques for the swat model evaluation the model performance was deemed satisfactory provided the values of the nse 0 5 rsr 0 7 r2 0 5 and pbias 25 for streamflow and pbias 55 for nitrate loads abbaspour et al 2018 2 6 climate change scenario development the climate change impact in the study area was analyzed using an ensemble of six global climate models access1 0 bcc csm1 1 cmcc cm gdfl esm2g ipsl cm5a lr and mpi esm mr from bias corrected coupled model intercomparison project cmip climate forcing data statistically downscaled on a 5 km grid for the navarre region for historical and future data of rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 emission scenarios this data was developed by the spanish national agency for meteorology aemet and was downloaded from the platform on adaptation to climate change in spain adaptecca portal adaptecca 2021 these two projected radiative forcing scenarios represent the potential moderate rcp4 5 and more aggressive rcp8 5 climate change impact scenarios with rcp4 5 assuming that greenhouse gas emissions will be gradually reduced in the coming years to achieve stability by 2100 and rcp8 5 assuming that greenhouse gas ghg emissions will continue to rise at current levels throughout the 21st century ipcc 2014 only the precipitation and temperature maximum and minimum datasets were used for the climate change simulation the calibrated swat model was used to simulate projected streamflow and nitrate load trends using climate change data precipitation and temperature as inputs while assuming all other variables to be constant crop heat units were used in the simulation to automatically assign agricultural management operations such as planting harvesting and fertilization periods the simulation was run for each gcm from 1971 to 2000 for historical reference and 2011 2100 for the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 future projection scenarios in total 18 simulations with six historical and 12 future projections were run 6 for each emission scenario the future projection scenarios of streamflow and nitrate export were analyzed for three distinct periods categorized into short term 2011 2040 medium term 2041 2070 and long term 2071 2100 by comparing each model to its historical period 1971 2000 finally the models results were combined and averaged to obtain an ensemble for the climate change analysis 3 results and discussions 3 1 model evaluation 3 1 1 parameterization and sensitivity analysis the most sensitive streamflow and nitrate load parameters along with their calibrated values are shown in table 2 the gw delay parameter regulates the rate and duration of groundwater recharge it estimates the time required for baseflow recharge the esco parameter influences the watershed s evapotranspiration the esco value was lower indicating that most of the model s evaporative demands were extracted from deeper soil layers because the shallow layers could not meet them niraula et al 2015 qi et al 2019 the cn2 is the curve number parameter typically affected by land use soil permeability and antecedent soil water conditions the higher the cn2 value the greater the surface runoff and the lower the infiltration and thus baseflow and vice versa the cdn parameter controls the amount of nitrate fertilizer lost due to denitrification denitrification losses are greater in areas with high moisture content than in areas with low moisture content the anion excl parameter estimates the amount of nitrate exported by water the fixco parameter regulates the amount of additional nitrogen provided to the plant to meet the legume demand when insufficient nitrate is in the root zone neitsch et al 2011 the greater the fixco value the more fixed the nitrogen demand and vice versa 3 1 2 streamflow calibration and validation the maximum and minimum parameter values were used to account for the uncertainty for each parameter with the fitted value providing the best simulation the 95ppu was used to quantify model uncertainties such as those related to parameters input data and structure during the calibration and validation periods the 95ppu results were represented by p factor 0 56 and 0 65 and r factor 0 70 and 0 67 values respectively these uncertainties may result in overestimation or underestimation by the model often due to the model not fully capturing all the hydrologic components in the watershed because of the model s conceptual simplifications ficklin et al 2013 meaurio et al 2015 rostamian et al 2008 tolson and shoemaker 2007 the model produced good results for streamflow prediction during calibration and validation reproducing most of the observed discharge and its tendency over time fig 3 the nse values 0 82 and 0 83 and r2 0 83 and 0 84 during calibration and validation periods indicate a strong relationship between the observed and simulated values indicating a good fit the negative pbias values 8 7 and 5 6 showed a slight but reasonable overestimation of the average flows by the model during the simulation periods the rsr value of 0 42 was satisfactory because it was below the recommended threshold of less than 0 7 indicating a good model performance the results of the four statistical performance indicators deemed the model to be very good and capable of simulating monthly streamflow in the study area as per the moriasi et al 2007 recommendations the validation period resulted in better model performance compared to the calibration period this could be due to improved input data such as precipitation and land use during the validation period the validation period s input data was more accurate such as precipitation with few to no missing gaps and using the most recent land use map from 2019 however there were a few meteorological data inconsistencies before 2004 particularly for the automatic stations as most were only operational after march 2004 3 1 3 nitrate load calibration and validation the nitrate load parameters were calibrated after successfully calibrating and fixing the streamflow parameters comparisons between the observed and simulated monthly nitrate loads hydrographs fig 4 indicated a good model performance the uncertainties in nitrate load simulation were accounted for using the 95ppu represented by the p factor 0 72 and 0 63 and r factor 0 92 and 0 98 during calibration and validation periods respectively some of the model weaknesses could have resulted from errors in the input data these include estimations of missing precipitation data used to generate the discharge boithias et al 2014 insufficient observed nitrate load data available since the concentration data were obtained from a highly scattered sampling frequency in most cases collected only once per month at random dates and with several months having missing data epelde et al 2015 and information related to the agricultural management operations and practices such as fertilizer application or planting and harvesting dates zettam et al 2020 the model simulation results were in good agreement with the observed data indicating good accountability of the model s various agricultural inputs the model s statistical performance was adequate with acceptable nse values 0 71 and 0 68 and r2 values 0 72 and 0 79 during the calibration and validation periods respectively the pbias results show that the model underestimates the nitrate loads by 9 2 and 7 during the calibration and validation periods respectively these results are within the acceptable thresholds recommended by moriasi et al 2007 indicating a good model performance the inter annual and seasonal variability of nitrate load was very high throughout the simulation period loads were higher in wetter years than in dry years and vice versa nitrate loads in the watershed increased from mid autumn and peaked during winter when precipitation was abundant and thus streamflow but gradually decreased from spring to summer when precipitation was scarce this could be attributed to increased streamflow and to some extent the nitrogen fertilizer application on agricultural fields because the planting season begins in october november increasing soil nitrogen levels nitrate concentration and subsequently nitrate loads in the watershed because nitrate load is a function of discharge used to transport it downstream higher precipitation in the watershed during the winter and spring months will inevitably increase nitrate load exportation in the river however during the summer when precipitation is scarce resulting in limited streamflow and there are almost no agricultural activities in the watershed s upper reaches which rely primarily on rainfed farming fewer nitrate loads are exported these results are consistent with those obtained by lam et al 2009 when modeling agricultural catchments in europe where they reported that these patterns could be attributed to higher nitrogen concentrations in the winter due to nitrogen mobilization in the watershed and a lack of plant uptake resulting in the accumulation of leachable nitrates and thus an increase in nitrogen concentration in streamflow during winter similar findings have also been reported by donmez et al 2020 who inferred that an increase in fertilization would lead to an increase in the amount of nitrate in the soil which would be directly related to plant growth and agricultural production and management according to abbaspour et al 2015 nitrate dynamics in agricultural watersheds are governed mainly by the fate and transportation of fertilizer in the soil the rate of organic matter decomposition and the prevailing climate 3 2 climate change impact analysis 3 2 1 projected precipitation and temperature analysis of the future climate projection compared to the historical reference depicts a general decrease in precipitation and an increase in temperature fig 5 illustrates the percent decrease in mean annual precipitation and increase in average temperature for all six climate models under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 emission scenarios over the three projected periods relative to the historical period the average decline in precipitation in the short medium and long term projections were 3 5 6 9 and 7 6 for rcp4 5 and 3 1 7 9 and 14 8 for rcp8 5 respectively the average temperature projections on the other hand increased progressively over the three periods by 1 2 ⁰c 1 9 ⁰c and 2 2 ⁰c for rcp4 5 and 1 4 ⁰c 2 0 ⁰c and 4 3 ⁰c for rcp8 5 the projected precipitation data varied more among the selected models than the projected temperature which was closely comparable across the models these projections are similar to those reported by the european environment agency eea 2017 for the mediterranean region indicating a significant increase in warming of 2 ⁰c to 5⁰c from the 2050 s to the end of the 21st century while the mean annual precipitation could decrease by 5 to 15 and in the worst case scenario up to 25 with an acceleration expected at the end of the century furthermore winter and autumn project a higher decrease in precipitation than summer and spring while summer temperature increases are greater than winter projected precipitation decline and temperature increase over the three time periods of 2040 2070 and 2100 have also been reported for other studies within the mediterranean region abd elmabod et al 2020 al mukhtar and qasim 2019 fonseca and santos 2019 these projected climate changes are expected to alter the watershed s hydrological cycle by increasing the air temperature and thus evapotranspiration a warmer atmosphere is expected to hold more water vapor causing precipitation concentrations to rise resulting in more frequent and intense extreme events abd elmabod et al 2020 navarra and tubiana 2013 however greater losses in open surface waters and soils are also expected with the projected high evapotranspiration rates 3 2 2 effects of climate change on streamflow the simulated climate change projections showed a declining effect on streamflow for both emission scenarios over all the projected periods analyzed with high interannual fluctuations fig 6 the average annual streamflow decreased by 11 5 27 4 and 28 5 for rcp4 5 and 8 5 27 5 and 52 4 for rcp8 5 during the short medium and long term future climate projections respectively compared to the historical reference period this decline was mainly attributed to the projected decrease in precipitation and increasing temperatures for all the climate models used in the study fig 5 leading to a rise in the watershed s evapotranspiration higher evapotranspiration rates and lower precipitation would result in declining discharge unless there is a significant shift in the seasonal pattern with more precipitation occurring during colder seasons anand and oinam 2019 molina navarro et al 2016 2014 the long term climate projection had the highest streamflow reductions for rcp4 5 28 5 and rcp8 5 52 4 the considerable streamflow reduction in rcp8 5 long term projection compared to rcp4 5 was due to the continuous increase in temperature and decreasing precipitation caused by the lack of climate change mitigation measures to reduce the ghg emissions for this scenario however for rcp4 5 some mitigation measures to reduce ghg emissions are expected to be implemented gradually from the mid term projection onwards the rcp4 5 long term projection showed greater extreme streamflow occurrences than the rcp8 5 which could be attributed to variations in precipitation and temperature intensity timing and frequency this could potentially result in more frequent and severe floods and streamflow under rcp4 5 as well as drought and drier conditions under the rcp8 5 scenario lowering the streamflow the projected long term streamflow reductions were slightly higher in summer and autumn than in winter and spring for both emission scenarios fig 7a the long term projection showed the greatest decrease with a 66 4 rcp8 5 and 42 0 rcp4 5 reduction in streamflow during autumn the declining patterns of the seasonal projections correspond to changes in precipitation and temperature these findings are consistent with other studies in the mediterranean climate that have found that annual streamflow in a watershed or on a regional scale is extremely sensitive to changes in precipitation such that a slight decrease in precipitation in regions with high temperatures and consequently higher evapotranspiration rates would likely result in a significant reduction in runoff ficklin et al 2013 molina navarro et al 2016 2014 the results especially the rcp8 5 long term projection have very strong implications for the water available in the river by the end of the century if the current global warming trends continue a decline of more than 50 of the currently available streamflow would seriously affect the available water resources for the aquatic ecosystem domestic consumption and agricultural use 3 2 3 effects of climate change on nitrate load the simulated future annual nitrate load decreased by 21 7 17 7 and 12 8 for rcp4 5 and 20 5 16 6 and 43 6 for rcp 8 5 in the short medium and long projections respectively compared to the historical reference period with very high interannual variability fig 8 the short term and medium term nitrate load projections under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 were quite similar however there was a considerable difference in the long term projection with rcp8 5 experiencing the greatest decline of 43 6 compared to 12 8 for rcp4 5 the decrease in projected nitrate load was primarily due to the reduction in projected streamflow the statistical relationship between streamflow and nitrate load showed a good correlation p value 0 05 for rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 over the entire future projection period this relationship indicates that streamflow mainly driven by precipitation and temperature would play an essential and critical role in determining the future nitrate export since it is the primary driving mechanism however the relationship between streamflow and nitrate load is not always linear despite streamflow having the greatest influence other factors that could play a critical role in determining the sources amounts mobilization and transport pathways of nitrate in an agricultural watershed include precipitation amount and intensity land cover type and practices fertilization quantity and type as well as cropping pattern and schedule boithias et al 2014 cameron et al 2013 parajuli and risal 2021 additionally the presence of buffer zones and riparian vegetation could help in minimizing nitrate mobilization and transport to surface waterways beaudoin et al 2005 these results are consistent with other studies within the mediterranean region molina navarro et al 2014 and the iberian peninsula carvalho santos et al 2016 that have reported a decrease in nitrogen exportation due to the reduced streamflow mander et al 2000 also found that reducing surface water runoff considerably reduced nitrate load exportation in cultivated areas the magnitude and frequency of nitrate load occurrence were greater in the long term projection scenario of rcp4 5 than rcp8 5 similar to the streamflow results this pattern could be due to the timing of agricultural management operations such as fertilization which could have coincided with heavy rainfall as well as more available water to transport the nitrates the increase in frequency and severity of extreme precipitation events under rcp4 5 after the 2070 s in the mediterranean region have been reported to result in increased streamflow and nitrate export almeida et al 2022 barredo et al 2017 giorgi and lionello 2008 todaro et al 2022 nitrate load decreased in all seasons and projected periods for both emission scenarios with the greatest decrease occurring in summer for the rcp8 5 long term projection 50 2 and autumn for the rcp4 5 medium term projection 22 6 fig 7b this could be due to higher streamflow reduction and the aforementioned factors during the same period however the nitrate concentration is projected to rise by 4 1 34 8 and 45 1 for rcp4 5 and 5 2 36 8 54 1 for rcp 8 5 in the short medium and long term projections respectively due to the faster streamflow decline than the nitrate exportation rate this would result in the accumulation of more nitrates in the riverbed and soil resulting in soil and groundwater pollution carvalho santos et al 2016 observed an increasing trend in future nitrate concentration despite the declining nitrate loads attributed to declining streamflow the projected increase in nitrate concentration at the end of the century will be of great concern as the current figures within the watershed already indicate a higher nitrate concentration findings by merchán et al 2020 have categorized the watershed as a nitrate vulnerable zone hence any increase in concentration is likely to exacerbate the problem further furthermore increased nitrate concentration would increase eutrophication in the river thus enhancing algae bloom and consequently degrading the water quality and resulting in higher water treatment costs tong et al 2012 table s2 in the supplementary materials summarizes all the climate change projection findings in terms of annual area specific averages 3 2 4 effect of climate change on agriculture projected climate change is expected to heavily impact agricultural activities through changes in phenology and cropping cycle funes et al 2016 trnka et al 2011 as well as higher water demands due to increased evapotranspiration saadi et al 2015 valverde et al 2015 consequently crop yields are expected to decline especially under the rcp8 5 long term projection with no adaptation measures feyen et al 2020 in addition to higher inter annual variability and decreased production resilience zampieri et al 2020 reduced streamflow would greatly affect irrigation particularly for corn and tomatoes grown in the study area which relies heavily on irrigation extreme warming as projected in the medium and long term will shorten the growing seasons for most crops according to mougou et al 2011 a temperature increase of 2 5 ⁰c to 4 ⁰c would shorten the growing period of wheat in the mediterranean region by 16 30 days recurrent drought events could result in heavy agricultural losses of more than 50 in irrigated areas and 15 in rain fed cereal production mougou et al 2011 other negative climate change impacts on agriculture in the region include the emergence of new and re emerging crop pests and diseases which would increase production losses as well as increased wildfire incidences caused by the projected extreme weather these factors would result in food insecurity and increased economic losses in the region and should thus be mitigated to limit the potential negative consequences 3 2 5 climate change adaptation and mitigation measures based on this study s findings it s evident that climate change would negatively affect the agricultural areas in northern spain and the mediterranean region since water resources will be under great pressure and nitrate pollution of surface and groundwater will increase as a result robust agricultural policies regulatory frameworks and legislation aimed at climate change adaptation and mitigation would be required to minimize the potential negative impacts the projected water scarcity and increased drought events would limit irrigation based adaptation actions however agricultural management practices such as crop distribution schedules diversification and rotation would be central to the adaptation strategy at the farm scale land use change by introducing drought resistant crops could also improve climate change resilience an effective adaptation and mitigation strategy would prioritize the following actions i farming practices which would include crop diversification changing crop type and land use and adjusting rotation patterns ii water management practices which would emphasize the need for technological development and innovation for crops and agricultural practices such as precision agriculture and modifying irrigation iii farm management practices that focus on diversifying income sources such as the government establishing programs to ensure agricultural subsidies the provision of insurance to farmers to stabilize their income and agricultural financial assistance iv agricultural management practices that focus on optimal nitrogen fertilization the use of organic fertilizers and soil health improvement nitrogen surplus in the soil can be reduced through efficient application according to the soil nitrogen availability and potential crop yield combining these adaptation and mitigation strategies would improve the potential for increasing or at least maintaining crop yield 4 conclusion the effect of climate change on water resources and nitrate export is of major concern in the mediterranean region and northern spain due to its arid and semi arid climatic conditions this paper evaluated the adoption of the swat model for simulating current and future streamflow and nitrate loads under rainfed conditions in a mediterranean agricultural area in northern spain the projected decline in precipitation and rise in temperature negatively impact both the streamflow and nitrate export on spatial and temporal scales reduced streamflow would reduce available water resources for agricultural and domestic use resulting in lower agricultural yield limited productivity and conflicts over scarce water resources although the projected nitrate load would also decrease due to declining streamflow the nitrate concentration levels are expected to rise due to the faster streamflow reduction rate than the nitrate load exportation rate resulting in nitrate pollution by accumulation in the soil and riverbed as well as groundwater pollution through percolation this study s findings could help understand the scope of the climate change problem in northern spain and develop appropriate adaptation and mitigation measures to help minimize the expected adverse effects these measures could include more sustainable water resource management and better land management policies such as efficient nitrogen fertilization these initiatives would be critical to adhere to the european union s nitrate policies and legislation as outlined in the water framework directive and the nitrate directive despite this study s valuable findings further research using a variety of climate models ensembles and other emission scenarios is needed to fully evaluate these impacts more research could be done to help understand the scope and magnitude of the uncertainties by combining future climate projected land uses

8894,predicting water quality and quantity response to climate change in a watershed is very difficult due to the complexity and uncertainties in estimating and understanding future hydrological conditions however hydrological models could simplify the processes and predict future impacts of agricultural activities this study aimed to evaluate the applicability of the soil water assessment tool swat model for climate change prediction of streamflow and nitrate load in an agricultural mediterranean watershed in northern spain the model was first evaluated for simulating streamflow and nitrate load under rainfed agricultural conditions in the cidacos river watershed in navarre spain then climate change impact analysis on streamflow and nitrate load was conducted in the short term 2011 2040 medium term 2041 2070 and long term 2071 2100 future projections relative to the historical baseline period 1971 2000 under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 co2 emission scenarios the model evaluation showed a good model performance result during calibration 2000 2010 and validation 2011 2020 for streamflow nse 0 82 0 83 and nitrate load nse 0 71 0 68 indicating its suitability for adoption in the watershed the climate change projection results showed a steady decline in streamflow and nitrate load for rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 in all projections with the long term projection scenario of rcp8 5 greatly affected autumn and winter saw a considerable drop in comparison to spring and summer the decline in streamflow was attributed to the projected decrease in precipitation and increase in temperatures while the nitrate load decline was consistent with the projected streamflow decline based on these projections the long term projection scenarios of rcp8 5 indicate dire situations requiring urgent policy changes and management interventions to minimize and mitigate the resulting climate change effects therefore adapted agricultural management practices are needed to ensure sustainable water resource utilization and efficient nitrogen fertilizer application rates in the watershed to reduce pollution graphical abstract ga1 keywords future projection nitrate load rainfed agriculture swat model water quality data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction agriculture is one of the most important sectors of any regional or national economy globally it is the primary source of livelihood and the backbone of most nations economic systems with more than 60 of the world population directly dependent on it fao 2017 however agricultural intensification puts great pressure on available water resources and the environment potentially causing damage these damages could range from soil erosion which is much more common in agricultural environments than in other soil uses garcía ruiz et al 2015 almagro et al 2016 boardman and poesen 2006 to water quality degradation caused by non point source pollution chahor et al 2014 giménez et al 2012 merchán et al 2018 sutton et al 2011 studies conducted within the navarre region of northern spain have identified considerable nitrate and phosphate concentrations in streams in cereal crop areas where the recommended thresholds are often exceeded albeit with seasonal and annual variability casalí et al 2008 hernández garcía et al 2020 merchán et al 2019 the cidacos river watershed in the navarre region has diverse land uses with rainfed agriculture predominating the watershed holds decades worth of nitrate concentration discharge and meteorological data collected by the government of navarre at various stations hence ideal for conducting investigations on agricultural activities impact on the quality and quantity of water resources in the area some of the challenges associated with agricultural practices in the study area are nitrate pollution in surface waters as evidenced by high nitrate concentration levels in the cidacos river merchán et al 2020 and anticipated climate change effects due to projected changes in temperature and precipitation affecting the cropping system funes et al 2016 trnka et al 2011 climate change impacts on water resources can be quantified by using various global or regional climate models gcms or rcms and future radiative forcing scenarios known as representative concentration pathways rcps to establish appropriate adaptation measures and policy interventions krysanova et al 2017 the mediterranean region particularly spain is considered to be highly vulnerable to climate change effects due to its geographical location and the imbalance between the available water resources and the current demands vargas amelin and pindado 2014 furthermore most climate change model projections for spain indicate an increase in temperature and a decrease in precipitation by the end of the 21st century candela et al 2012 chirivella osma et al 2015 estrela et al 2012 majone et al 2012 somot et al 2008 climate change is expected to affect all aspects of the environment compounding agricultural effects on streamflow and nitrate exportation arora 2019 for instance a change in streamflow due to projected temperature and precipitation changes would result in extreme events such as droughts or floods these events would in turn influence the nitrate dynamics in the watershed by changing the exported nitrate loads and concentration accumulated in the soils and water therefore it is important to investigate the potential effects of climate change on streamflow and nitrate dynamics as they would impair the current hydrological conditions and hinder the achievement of nitrate standards as stipulated by the european water framework directive european communities 2000 nitrate pollution is a global concern that affects water quality by making it unsafe for human consumption who 2017 and increases eutrophication sutton et al 2011 nitrate pollution contributors on a watershed could include agriculture livestock and aquaculture casalí et al 2008 fao iwmi 2018 menció et al 2016 whilst some level of nitrate exportation is inevitable in agricultural areas improved management practices could limit its effect on streams beaudoin et al 2005 boithias et al 2014 cameron et al 2013 to address nitrate pollution challenge the european commission has established policy legislations such as the nitrate directive nd directive 91 676 eec and the european water framework directive wfd directive 2000 60 eec to protect water bodies from agricultural nitrate pollution with a nitrate concentration threshold of 50 mg l 1 for european rivers european communities 1991 however more research is needed to understand the spatial and temporal interactions of water quality variables and quantify the loads to assess their climate change impacts mathematical models are fundamental tools for hydrological and environmental planning with their greatest potential being the ability to generate scenarios in the face of voluntary or imposed changes in land use or management the soil water assessment tool swat model is one of the best available tools for simulating the response of agricultural or non agricultural watersheds to water quality the swat model has been widely used by water resources experts to understand the characteristics of a watershed and predict its hydrological response to external climate and internal water management land management etc drivers and their impacts the swat model has been applied in the mediterranean region and particularly spain for streamflow analysis harraki et al 2021 jimeno sáez et al 2018 meaurio et al 2015 and water quality assessment of nitrogen and nitrates epelde et al 2015 zabaleta et al 2014 zettam et al 2020 the majority of nitrate studies conducted by the swat model focus on how to reduce nitrate pollution through land use changes ferrant et al 2011 wang et al 2008 as well as regulating fertilizer application rates and other management practices like tillage boithias et al 2014 cerro et al 2014 ferrant et al 2011 liu et al 2013 despite several studies on streamflow and hydrological response to climate change there has been very little research on the effects of climate change on water quality ficklin et al 2010 luz rodríguez blanco et al 2019 martínková et al 2011 molina navarro et al 2014 moreover there are no long term climate change assessments of the effects of agricultural activities on streamflow and water quality in the navarre region this study aimed to evaluate the swat model s applicability for climate change prediction of streamflow and nitrate load in a rainfed agricultural mediterranean watershed in northern spain the model was first evaluated for its capacity to simulate streamflow and nitrate export under rainfed agricultural conditions in the upper reaches of the cidacos river watershed and then used to assess the climate change impacts by comparing future projections to the historical baseline under two emission scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 the findings from this study could provide valuable information on climate change adaptation and mitigation measures in the future and deepen the knowledge on nitrate exportation and pollution in the study area 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the cidacos river is one of the tributaries of the aragón river which is a tributary of the ebro river it is located approximately 15 km south of pamplona the capital of the chartered community of navarre in spain at latitudes 42 69 and 42 34 north and longitudes 1 72 and 1 47 west the cidacos river drains a watershed area of 477 km2 and runs north south with an approximate length of 44 km and width of 15 km in its widest section fig 1 the watershed s headwater is somewhat mountainous in the north with high altitudes of slightly over 1000 m above sea level but then crosses down to slightly uneven to low terrain of approximately 300 m above sea level in the south at the river s mouth in traibuenas where it joins the aragón river the watershed s climate is humid to dry temperate mild mediterranean with cold winters monthly average 4 7 ⁰c to 5 4 ⁰c in january and warm summers monthly average 21 2 ⁰c to 23 7 ⁰c in august that vary spatially from north to south the annual average temperature ranges from 12 2 ⁰c to 14 2 ⁰c north to south the watershed receives annual precipitation from 800 mm in the north to 400 mm in the south characterized by strong inter annual variability and high summer aridity the wettest months are april and may merchán et al 2020 agriculture is the predominant land use in the watershed accounting for 53 of the total area fig 2a other major land uses in the watershed include forests 25 and pasture and bushlands 17 the remaining 5 comprises urban residential areas built up land bare land and water bodies rainfed agriculture covers 176 km2 37 of the total area and 70 of cultivated land and is primarily in the watershed s upper reaches until olite town irrigated land on the other hand covers 77 km2 16 of the total area and 30 of the cultivated land and is largely in the watershed s lower reaches the main crops grown are rainfed winter cereals wheat and barley and vineyards orchard other crops grown in small quantities include corn tomatoes and potatoes the average annual fertilizer application rates range from 80 to 130 kg n ha 1 for winter cereals and 40 50 kg n ha 1 for vineyards oduor et al 2023 the most abundant soil textures in the watershed are loam and clay loam which are found in most agricultural areas while loamy sand and sandy loam soils are found on eroded hillslopes red clay soils dominate the watershed with sandstone and mudstones according to the fao classification system iuss working group wrb 2015 the watershed s predominant soil types are haplic calciols soils 51 6 fluvic camisols soils 26 1 which are mostly found along the river network path and alaric regosols 18 haplic phaeozem 1 7 calcic castanea s 1 6 fluvic phaeozem 0 4 eutric fluvisols 0 3 and dystric cambisols 0 2 are among the other soils found in the watershed fig 2b 2 2 description of the swat model the swat model is an open source software developed by the united states department of agriculture s agricultural research service usda ars to help water resource managers policy experts and decision makers predict and quantify the impact of land use management on water and diffuse pollution in small and large watersheds with varying soil types land use and management practices neitsch et al 2011 swat is a data driven semi distributed continuous timescale physical and process based hydrological model that simulates water sediments and agricultural chemicals or pollutant yields the swat simulation process divides the watershed s hydrology into land and routing phases in the land phase the water sediment and nutrient balances are calculated for each hydrological response unit hru whereas in the routing phase the hru outputs are aggregated and routed through the channel network to the outlet of the watershed arnold et al 2012 the hru consists of a unique homogeneous combination of similar land use soil type and topography characteristics neitsch et al 2011 the water balance equation simulates the watershed s hydrological component arnold et al 2012 neitsch et al 2011 the organic and mineral nitrogen cycles are simulated in swat by dividing the nutrients in the soil into organic and inorganic parts and component pools which can increase or decrease depending on the transformation and additions or losses occurring within each pool green and van griensven 2008 the movement and transformation of various forms of nitrogen within a watershed are introduced into the main channel through surface runoff and lateral subsurface flow and transported downstream with the flow arabi et al 2008 2 3 data acquisition the swat model requires geospatial and hydrometeorological input data variables the data for this study were primarily obtained from the government of navarre agencies and websites as shown in table 1 the climate data were obtained at a daily time step from 12 weather stations both manual and automatic located within and near the watershed from 1990 to 2020 the selected stations represented the spatial heterogeneity of the watershed s climate the meteorological data included daily data of precipitation mm maximum and minimum daily temperatures c solar radiation mj m 2 s 2 wind speed m s 1 and relative humidity data the agricultural management information which included planting and harvesting dates the average annual fertilizer application rates and the main crops cultivated in the watershed were obtained from intia s technical team and extension advisors who conduct field interviews in consultation with key informants such as farmers within the watershed see table s1 the monthly observed streamflow data and nitrate loads from 2000 to 2020 were used for the model evaluation the data used were obtained from the olite gauging station since it was the only station in the watershed with consistent and extensive long term data of observed discharge and nitrate concentration data as it has been operational since 1988 and covers the watershed area under rainfed agriculture 2 4 the swat model set up and run the model set up was preceded by preparing and processing the necessary spatial datasets such as dem soil and land use grid maps and discharge outlet points on the qgis 3 18 interphase the model was set up in the qswat3 1 1 1 interphase by performing watershed delineation hru creation input editing and running the swat model the watershed was delineated using the dem and the cidacos river shapefile until the outlet at traibuenas discretization was done using a minimum area threshold of 10 km2 required to create streams resulting in a watershed area of 477 02 km2 with 23 sub watersheds a slope elevation band of 0 5 5 10 and 10 and above was provided to the model the watershed s overall elevation ranged from 315 m to 1150 m with an average elevation of 560 m by overlaying the lulc and soil grid maps and using a 5 threshold for land uses soil type and slope values 1404 hrus were generated this threshold was chosen to eliminate minor land uses soils and slopes in each sub watershed facilitating model processing by improving its performance speed and efficiency using the swat editor the weather data and agricultural management information were added to the model 2 5 sensitivity analysis calibration and validation the swat calibration and uncertainty procedures swatcup version 5 1 6 a standalone software was used to perform sensitivity analysis calibration and validation of the model the multi site sequential uncertainty fitting version 2 sufi 2 a semi automated inverse modeling routine procedure of swatcup was used in this study the model was run 500 times for each iteration and the parameter sensitivity was determined by performing a global sensitivity analysis in which all parameters changed simultaneously multiple regression computations were used to identify the most sensitive parameters the latin hypercube generated parameters are regressed against the objective function values in this system abbaspour 2015 the t test was used to determine the relative significance of each parameter the p values and t stat indices were used to assess the sensitivity of the parameters the parameter was more sensitive when the p value was lower and vice versa the best combination for obtaining the most sensitive parameter is a very small p value and a large t value absolute parameters that had p values less than 0 05 were deemed highly sensitive the parameter sensitivity was ranked using the t stat index and the p value to identify the most sensitive parameters that had the greatest impact on the model outputs arnold et al 2012 larger parameter uncertainties were initially assumed to ensure that most observed data fell within the 95 prediction uncertainty 95ppu band abbaspour et al 2018 95ppu accounts for all the uncertainties within the model combined the parameter ranges were adjusted after every iteration run during the calibration phase until most of the observed data were bracketed in the 95ppu band the model was deemed satisfactory when more than 50 of the observed flow data were bracketed within the 95ppu the model was run from 1990 to 2020 with the first ten years 1990 1999 serving as the warm up period to allow the model to reach an optimal state before reading the outputs the model was then evaluated over the remaining period 2000 2020 which was divided into calibration 2000 2010 and validation 2011 2020 phases the streamflow parameters were first satisfactorily calibrated and fixed before calibrating the nitrate parameters the calibration parameters were chosen from the abundant existing literature on streamflow and nitrate calibration using the swat model in the mediterranean region abbaspour 2015 abbaspour et al 2018 2015 kamali et al 2017 kouchi et al 2017 rouholahnejad et al 2014 to change the parameter values in swat three methods parameter qualifiers are used r which refers to a relative change of the specified parameter that increases or decreases the existing swat parameter value by multiplying it by 1 fitted value to obtain the new parameter value v which refers to value change or replacement which means that the initial swat parameter value is to be directly replaced by the fitted value and a which refers to addition and means that the fitted value is added to the initial swat parameter value after the sensitivity analysis the final streamflow and nitrate load calibration parameters were chosen the model results were presented graphically on the hydrograph plots for the simulated and observed values during the calibration and validation periods the model s performance was evaluated using the commonly used statistical performance indicator techniques for hydrological modeling moriasi et al 2007 have recommended the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse the coefficient of determination r2 the root mean square error to the standard deviation of observed data ratio rsr and the percent bias pbias as the most suitable quantitative statistical techniques for the swat model evaluation the model performance was deemed satisfactory provided the values of the nse 0 5 rsr 0 7 r2 0 5 and pbias 25 for streamflow and pbias 55 for nitrate loads abbaspour et al 2018 2 6 climate change scenario development the climate change impact in the study area was analyzed using an ensemble of six global climate models access1 0 bcc csm1 1 cmcc cm gdfl esm2g ipsl cm5a lr and mpi esm mr from bias corrected coupled model intercomparison project cmip climate forcing data statistically downscaled on a 5 km grid for the navarre region for historical and future data of rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 emission scenarios this data was developed by the spanish national agency for meteorology aemet and was downloaded from the platform on adaptation to climate change in spain adaptecca portal adaptecca 2021 these two projected radiative forcing scenarios represent the potential moderate rcp4 5 and more aggressive rcp8 5 climate change impact scenarios with rcp4 5 assuming that greenhouse gas emissions will be gradually reduced in the coming years to achieve stability by 2100 and rcp8 5 assuming that greenhouse gas ghg emissions will continue to rise at current levels throughout the 21st century ipcc 2014 only the precipitation and temperature maximum and minimum datasets were used for the climate change simulation the calibrated swat model was used to simulate projected streamflow and nitrate load trends using climate change data precipitation and temperature as inputs while assuming all other variables to be constant crop heat units were used in the simulation to automatically assign agricultural management operations such as planting harvesting and fertilization periods the simulation was run for each gcm from 1971 to 2000 for historical reference and 2011 2100 for the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 future projection scenarios in total 18 simulations with six historical and 12 future projections were run 6 for each emission scenario the future projection scenarios of streamflow and nitrate export were analyzed for three distinct periods categorized into short term 2011 2040 medium term 2041 2070 and long term 2071 2100 by comparing each model to its historical period 1971 2000 finally the models results were combined and averaged to obtain an ensemble for the climate change analysis 3 results and discussions 3 1 model evaluation 3 1 1 parameterization and sensitivity analysis the most sensitive streamflow and nitrate load parameters along with their calibrated values are shown in table 2 the gw delay parameter regulates the rate and duration of groundwater recharge it estimates the time required for baseflow recharge the esco parameter influences the watershed s evapotranspiration the esco value was lower indicating that most of the model s evaporative demands were extracted from deeper soil layers because the shallow layers could not meet them niraula et al 2015 qi et al 2019 the cn2 is the curve number parameter typically affected by land use soil permeability and antecedent soil water conditions the higher the cn2 value the greater the surface runoff and the lower the infiltration and thus baseflow and vice versa the cdn parameter controls the amount of nitrate fertilizer lost due to denitrification denitrification losses are greater in areas with high moisture content than in areas with low moisture content the anion excl parameter estimates the amount of nitrate exported by water the fixco parameter regulates the amount of additional nitrogen provided to the plant to meet the legume demand when insufficient nitrate is in the root zone neitsch et al 2011 the greater the fixco value the more fixed the nitrogen demand and vice versa 3 1 2 streamflow calibration and validation the maximum and minimum parameter values were used to account for the uncertainty for each parameter with the fitted value providing the best simulation the 95ppu was used to quantify model uncertainties such as those related to parameters input data and structure during the calibration and validation periods the 95ppu results were represented by p factor 0 56 and 0 65 and r factor 0 70 and 0 67 values respectively these uncertainties may result in overestimation or underestimation by the model often due to the model not fully capturing all the hydrologic components in the watershed because of the model s conceptual simplifications ficklin et al 2013 meaurio et al 2015 rostamian et al 2008 tolson and shoemaker 2007 the model produced good results for streamflow prediction during calibration and validation reproducing most of the observed discharge and its tendency over time fig 3 the nse values 0 82 and 0 83 and r2 0 83 and 0 84 during calibration and validation periods indicate a strong relationship between the observed and simulated values indicating a good fit the negative pbias values 8 7 and 5 6 showed a slight but reasonable overestimation of the average flows by the model during the simulation periods the rsr value of 0 42 was satisfactory because it was below the recommended threshold of less than 0 7 indicating a good model performance the results of the four statistical performance indicators deemed the model to be very good and capable of simulating monthly streamflow in the study area as per the moriasi et al 2007 recommendations the validation period resulted in better model performance compared to the calibration period this could be due to improved input data such as precipitation and land use during the validation period the validation period s input data was more accurate such as precipitation with few to no missing gaps and using the most recent land use map from 2019 however there were a few meteorological data inconsistencies before 2004 particularly for the automatic stations as most were only operational after march 2004 3 1 3 nitrate load calibration and validation the nitrate load parameters were calibrated after successfully calibrating and fixing the streamflow parameters comparisons between the observed and simulated monthly nitrate loads hydrographs fig 4 indicated a good model performance the uncertainties in nitrate load simulation were accounted for using the 95ppu represented by the p factor 0 72 and 0 63 and r factor 0 92 and 0 98 during calibration and validation periods respectively some of the model weaknesses could have resulted from errors in the input data these include estimations of missing precipitation data used to generate the discharge boithias et al 2014 insufficient observed nitrate load data available since the concentration data were obtained from a highly scattered sampling frequency in most cases collected only once per month at random dates and with several months having missing data epelde et al 2015 and information related to the agricultural management operations and practices such as fertilizer application or planting and harvesting dates zettam et al 2020 the model simulation results were in good agreement with the observed data indicating good accountability of the model s various agricultural inputs the model s statistical performance was adequate with acceptable nse values 0 71 and 0 68 and r2 values 0 72 and 0 79 during the calibration and validation periods respectively the pbias results show that the model underestimates the nitrate loads by 9 2 and 7 during the calibration and validation periods respectively these results are within the acceptable thresholds recommended by moriasi et al 2007 indicating a good model performance the inter annual and seasonal variability of nitrate load was very high throughout the simulation period loads were higher in wetter years than in dry years and vice versa nitrate loads in the watershed increased from mid autumn and peaked during winter when precipitation was abundant and thus streamflow but gradually decreased from spring to summer when precipitation was scarce this could be attributed to increased streamflow and to some extent the nitrogen fertilizer application on agricultural fields because the planting season begins in october november increasing soil nitrogen levels nitrate concentration and subsequently nitrate loads in the watershed because nitrate load is a function of discharge used to transport it downstream higher precipitation in the watershed during the winter and spring months will inevitably increase nitrate load exportation in the river however during the summer when precipitation is scarce resulting in limited streamflow and there are almost no agricultural activities in the watershed s upper reaches which rely primarily on rainfed farming fewer nitrate loads are exported these results are consistent with those obtained by lam et al 2009 when modeling agricultural catchments in europe where they reported that these patterns could be attributed to higher nitrogen concentrations in the winter due to nitrogen mobilization in the watershed and a lack of plant uptake resulting in the accumulation of leachable nitrates and thus an increase in nitrogen concentration in streamflow during winter similar findings have also been reported by donmez et al 2020 who inferred that an increase in fertilization would lead to an increase in the amount of nitrate in the soil which would be directly related to plant growth and agricultural production and management according to abbaspour et al 2015 nitrate dynamics in agricultural watersheds are governed mainly by the fate and transportation of fertilizer in the soil the rate of organic matter decomposition and the prevailing climate 3 2 climate change impact analysis 3 2 1 projected precipitation and temperature analysis of the future climate projection compared to the historical reference depicts a general decrease in precipitation and an increase in temperature fig 5 illustrates the percent decrease in mean annual precipitation and increase in average temperature for all six climate models under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 emission scenarios over the three projected periods relative to the historical period the average decline in precipitation in the short medium and long term projections were 3 5 6 9 and 7 6 for rcp4 5 and 3 1 7 9 and 14 8 for rcp8 5 respectively the average temperature projections on the other hand increased progressively over the three periods by 1 2 ⁰c 1 9 ⁰c and 2 2 ⁰c for rcp4 5 and 1 4 ⁰c 2 0 ⁰c and 4 3 ⁰c for rcp8 5 the projected precipitation data varied more among the selected models than the projected temperature which was closely comparable across the models these projections are similar to those reported by the european environment agency eea 2017 for the mediterranean region indicating a significant increase in warming of 2 ⁰c to 5⁰c from the 2050 s to the end of the 21st century while the mean annual precipitation could decrease by 5 to 15 and in the worst case scenario up to 25 with an acceleration expected at the end of the century furthermore winter and autumn project a higher decrease in precipitation than summer and spring while summer temperature increases are greater than winter projected precipitation decline and temperature increase over the three time periods of 2040 2070 and 2100 have also been reported for other studies within the mediterranean region abd elmabod et al 2020 al mukhtar and qasim 2019 fonseca and santos 2019 these projected climate changes are expected to alter the watershed s hydrological cycle by increasing the air temperature and thus evapotranspiration a warmer atmosphere is expected to hold more water vapor causing precipitation concentrations to rise resulting in more frequent and intense extreme events abd elmabod et al 2020 navarra and tubiana 2013 however greater losses in open surface waters and soils are also expected with the projected high evapotranspiration rates 3 2 2 effects of climate change on streamflow the simulated climate change projections showed a declining effect on streamflow for both emission scenarios over all the projected periods analyzed with high interannual fluctuations fig 6 the average annual streamflow decreased by 11 5 27 4 and 28 5 for rcp4 5 and 8 5 27 5 and 52 4 for rcp8 5 during the short medium and long term future climate projections respectively compared to the historical reference period this decline was mainly attributed to the projected decrease in precipitation and increasing temperatures for all the climate models used in the study fig 5 leading to a rise in the watershed s evapotranspiration higher evapotranspiration rates and lower precipitation would result in declining discharge unless there is a significant shift in the seasonal pattern with more precipitation occurring during colder seasons anand and oinam 2019 molina navarro et al 2016 2014 the long term climate projection had the highest streamflow reductions for rcp4 5 28 5 and rcp8 5 52 4 the considerable streamflow reduction in rcp8 5 long term projection compared to rcp4 5 was due to the continuous increase in temperature and decreasing precipitation caused by the lack of climate change mitigation measures to reduce the ghg emissions for this scenario however for rcp4 5 some mitigation measures to reduce ghg emissions are expected to be implemented gradually from the mid term projection onwards the rcp4 5 long term projection showed greater extreme streamflow occurrences than the rcp8 5 which could be attributed to variations in precipitation and temperature intensity timing and frequency this could potentially result in more frequent and severe floods and streamflow under rcp4 5 as well as drought and drier conditions under the rcp8 5 scenario lowering the streamflow the projected long term streamflow reductions were slightly higher in summer and autumn than in winter and spring for both emission scenarios fig 7a the long term projection showed the greatest decrease with a 66 4 rcp8 5 and 42 0 rcp4 5 reduction in streamflow during autumn the declining patterns of the seasonal projections correspond to changes in precipitation and temperature these findings are consistent with other studies in the mediterranean climate that have found that annual streamflow in a watershed or on a regional scale is extremely sensitive to changes in precipitation such that a slight decrease in precipitation in regions with high temperatures and consequently higher evapotranspiration rates would likely result in a significant reduction in runoff ficklin et al 2013 molina navarro et al 2016 2014 the results especially the rcp8 5 long term projection have very strong implications for the water available in the river by the end of the century if the current global warming trends continue a decline of more than 50 of the currently available streamflow would seriously affect the available water resources for the aquatic ecosystem domestic consumption and agricultural use 3 2 3 effects of climate change on nitrate load the simulated future annual nitrate load decreased by 21 7 17 7 and 12 8 for rcp4 5 and 20 5 16 6 and 43 6 for rcp 8 5 in the short medium and long projections respectively compared to the historical reference period with very high interannual variability fig 8 the short term and medium term nitrate load projections under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 were quite similar however there was a considerable difference in the long term projection with rcp8 5 experiencing the greatest decline of 43 6 compared to 12 8 for rcp4 5 the decrease in projected nitrate load was primarily due to the reduction in projected streamflow the statistical relationship between streamflow and nitrate load showed a good correlation p value 0 05 for rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 over the entire future projection period this relationship indicates that streamflow mainly driven by precipitation and temperature would play an essential and critical role in determining the future nitrate export since it is the primary driving mechanism however the relationship between streamflow and nitrate load is not always linear despite streamflow having the greatest influence other factors that could play a critical role in determining the sources amounts mobilization and transport pathways of nitrate in an agricultural watershed include precipitation amount and intensity land cover type and practices fertilization quantity and type as well as cropping pattern and schedule boithias et al 2014 cameron et al 2013 parajuli and risal 2021 additionally the presence of buffer zones and riparian vegetation could help in minimizing nitrate mobilization and transport to surface waterways beaudoin et al 2005 these results are consistent with other studies within the mediterranean region molina navarro et al 2014 and the iberian peninsula carvalho santos et al 2016 that have reported a decrease in nitrogen exportation due to the reduced streamflow mander et al 2000 also found that reducing surface water runoff considerably reduced nitrate load exportation in cultivated areas the magnitude and frequency of nitrate load occurrence were greater in the long term projection scenario of rcp4 5 than rcp8 5 similar to the streamflow results this pattern could be due to the timing of agricultural management operations such as fertilization which could have coincided with heavy rainfall as well as more available water to transport the nitrates the increase in frequency and severity of extreme precipitation events under rcp4 5 after the 2070 s in the mediterranean region have been reported to result in increased streamflow and nitrate export almeida et al 2022 barredo et al 2017 giorgi and lionello 2008 todaro et al 2022 nitrate load decreased in all seasons and projected periods for both emission scenarios with the greatest decrease occurring in summer for the rcp8 5 long term projection 50 2 and autumn for the rcp4 5 medium term projection 22 6 fig 7b this could be due to higher streamflow reduction and the aforementioned factors during the same period however the nitrate concentration is projected to rise by 4 1 34 8 and 45 1 for rcp4 5 and 5 2 36 8 54 1 for rcp 8 5 in the short medium and long term projections respectively due to the faster streamflow decline than the nitrate exportation rate this would result in the accumulation of more nitrates in the riverbed and soil resulting in soil and groundwater pollution carvalho santos et al 2016 observed an increasing trend in future nitrate concentration despite the declining nitrate loads attributed to declining streamflow the projected increase in nitrate concentration at the end of the century will be of great concern as the current figures within the watershed already indicate a higher nitrate concentration findings by merchán et al 2020 have categorized the watershed as a nitrate vulnerable zone hence any increase in concentration is likely to exacerbate the problem further furthermore increased nitrate concentration would increase eutrophication in the river thus enhancing algae bloom and consequently degrading the water quality and resulting in higher water treatment costs tong et al 2012 table s2 in the supplementary materials summarizes all the climate change projection findings in terms of annual area specific averages 3 2 4 effect of climate change on agriculture projected climate change is expected to heavily impact agricultural activities through changes in phenology and cropping cycle funes et al 2016 trnka et al 2011 as well as higher water demands due to increased evapotranspiration saadi et al 2015 valverde et al 2015 consequently crop yields are expected to decline especially under the rcp8 5 long term projection with no adaptation measures feyen et al 2020 in addition to higher inter annual variability and decreased production resilience zampieri et al 2020 reduced streamflow would greatly affect irrigation particularly for corn and tomatoes grown in the study area which relies heavily on irrigation extreme warming as projected in the medium and long term will shorten the growing seasons for most crops according to mougou et al 2011 a temperature increase of 2 5 ⁰c to 4 ⁰c would shorten the growing period of wheat in the mediterranean region by 16 30 days recurrent drought events could result in heavy agricultural losses of more than 50 in irrigated areas and 15 in rain fed cereal production mougou et al 2011 other negative climate change impacts on agriculture in the region include the emergence of new and re emerging crop pests and diseases which would increase production losses as well as increased wildfire incidences caused by the projected extreme weather these factors would result in food insecurity and increased economic losses in the region and should thus be mitigated to limit the potential negative consequences 3 2 5 climate change adaptation and mitigation measures based on this study s findings it s evident that climate change would negatively affect the agricultural areas in northern spain and the mediterranean region since water resources will be under great pressure and nitrate pollution of surface and groundwater will increase as a result robust agricultural policies regulatory frameworks and legislation aimed at climate change adaptation and mitigation would be required to minimize the potential negative impacts the projected water scarcity and increased drought events would limit irrigation based adaptation actions however agricultural management practices such as crop distribution schedules diversification and rotation would be central to the adaptation strategy at the farm scale land use change by introducing drought resistant crops could also improve climate change resilience an effective adaptation and mitigation strategy would prioritize the following actions i farming practices which would include crop diversification changing crop type and land use and adjusting rotation patterns ii water management practices which would emphasize the need for technological development and innovation for crops and agricultural practices such as precision agriculture and modifying irrigation iii farm management practices that focus on diversifying income sources such as the government establishing programs to ensure agricultural subsidies the provision of insurance to farmers to stabilize their income and agricultural financial assistance iv agricultural management practices that focus on optimal nitrogen fertilization the use of organic fertilizers and soil health improvement nitrogen surplus in the soil can be reduced through efficient application according to the soil nitrogen availability and potential crop yield combining these adaptation and mitigation strategies would improve the potential for increasing or at least maintaining crop yield 4 conclusion the effect of climate change on water resources and nitrate export is of major concern in the mediterranean region and northern spain due to its arid and semi arid climatic conditions this paper evaluated the adoption of the swat model for simulating current and future streamflow and nitrate loads under rainfed conditions in a mediterranean agricultural area in northern spain the projected decline in precipitation and rise in temperature negatively impact both the streamflow and nitrate export on spatial and temporal scales reduced streamflow would reduce available water resources for agricultural and domestic use resulting in lower agricultural yield limited productivity and conflicts over scarce water resources although the projected nitrate load would also decrease due to declining streamflow the nitrate concentration levels are expected to rise due to the faster streamflow reduction rate than the nitrate load exportation rate resulting in nitrate pollution by accumulation in the soil and riverbed as well as groundwater pollution through percolation this study s findings could help understand the scope of the climate change problem in northern spain and develop appropriate adaptation and mitigation measures to help minimize the expected adverse effects these measures could include more sustainable water resource management and better land management policies such as efficient nitrogen fertilization these initiatives would be critical to adhere to the european union s nitrate policies and legislation as outlined in the water framework directive and the nitrate directive despite this study s valuable findings further research using a variety of climate models ensembles and other emission scenarios is needed to fully evaluate these impacts more research could be done to help understand the scope and magnitude of the uncertainties by combining future climate projected land uses
