7275,groundwater quality in many regions with intense agriculture has deteriorated due to the leaching of nitrate and other agricultural pollutants modified agricultural practices can reduce the input of nitrate to groundwater bodies but it is crucial to determine the time span over which these measures become effective at reducing nitrate levels in pumping wells such estimates can be obtained from hydrogeological modeling or lumped parameter models lpm in combination with environmental tracer data two challenges in such tracer based estimates are i accounting for the different modes of transport in the unsaturated zone usz and ii assessing uncertainties here we extend a recently published bayesian inference scheme for simple lpms to include an explicit usz model and apply it to the dünnerngäu aquifer switzerland compared to a previous estimate of travel times in the aquifer based on a 2d hydrogeological model our approach provides a more accurate assessment of the dynamics of nitrate concentrations in the aquifer we find that including tracer measurements 3h 3he 85kr 39ar 4he reduces uncertainty in nitrate predictions if nitrate time series at wells are not available or short but does not necessarily lead to better predictions if long nitrate time series are available additionally the combination of tracer data with nitrate time series allows for a separation of the travel times in the unsaturated and saturated zone keywords nitrate pollution thick unsaturated zone groundwater dating lumped parameter model uncertainty estimation bayesian inference 1 introduction rising nitrate concentrations are negatively impacting the quality of drinking water around the world in some cases production wells are ultimately abandoned e g alikhani et al 2016 in others agricultural management practices are changed to reduce the input of nitrate e g bailey et al 2015 hansen et al 2011 wassenaar et al 2006 due to the costs involved with such nitrate reduction measures it is important to assess their effectiveness such assessments entail not only an estimation of the nitrate reduction potential but also an estimation of the time lag between implementation of the measures and the decrease of nitrate concentrations in the pumping wells this time lag is determined mainly by the travel time of water from the point s of recharge to the pumping well böhlke 2002 böhlke and denver 1995 under ideal conditions this time lag can be determined by comparing observed nitrate concentrations in wells and historical inputs of nitrate into groundwater however measured nitrate time series in wells are often too short the nitrate input history is not known well enough or other processes affect the nitrate concentrations such as denitrification see e g alikhani et al 2016 or dilution with water that is low in nitrate e g baillieux et al 2014 thus in most cases travel times of groundwater as well as these additional processes affecting nitrate are determined by means of hydrogeological modeling 2d or 3d and particle tracking environmental tracers or a combination of both alikhani et al 2016 green et al 2008 jeffrey starn et al 2014 kaown et al 2009 macdonald et al 2003 mcmahon et al 2006 osenbrück et al 2006 visser et al 2009 wang et al 2012 zoellmann et al 2001 environmental tracers are a complementary tool to hydrogeological models and time series of nitrate or other tracers for determining travel time distributions or age distributions of groundwater and dilution turnadge and smerdon 2014 visser et al 2009 measurements of δ18o sf6 3h 85kr cfcs 39ar 14c or 4he are commonly interpreted with lumped parameter models lpm to obtain travel time distributions the concentrations of the tracers in a well are calculated as the convolution integral of the input history of the tracers and a relatively simple shape of the age distribution zuber and maloszewski 2001 these shapes can be described by one to just a few parameters fitted to best reproduce measured concentrations of the environmental tracers and their pre selection is often based on the hydrogeological characteristics of the studied area cook and böhlke 2000 knowing the age distribution and the nitrate input history can help reconstruct nitrate concentrations in a given well in the past and predict how they will evolve in the future alternatively the nitrate input history can be reconstructed from measured nitrate time series in combination with the age distribution visser et al 2007 two current difficulties for such assessments are that i there is a lack of environmental tracers that can reliably determine travel times of water in the unsaturated zone and ii very few studies to date have included a rigorous assessment of the uncertainties associated with the determined age distributions and predictions of nitrate concentrations alikhani et al 2016 in the unsaturated zone usz nitrate is transported in the water phase while most environmental tracers are predominately transported in the gas phase with the exception of 2h 3h and 18o which are part of the water molecule itself because the two modes of transport have different velocities travel times for nitrate and environmental tracers from the surface to the well are different especially if the usz is thick because diffusive transport of gaseous tracers in the usz is typically faster than the advective transport in the water phase the usz is often neglected for gaseous tracers zoellmann et al 2001 i e the travel time estimated with these tracers is assumed to represent the travel time in the saturated zone sz only however for aquifers with a thick usz the travel time of water and thus nitrate in the usz can be a significant portion of the total travel time to the well sousa et al 2013 wang et al 2012 and several studies have pointed out that it is problematic to ignore thick uszs 10 m johnston et al 1998 schwientek et al 2009 zoellmann et al 2001 to our knowledge a study by osenbrück et al 2006 is the only study that has considered the time lag of gaseous tracers in the usz for cfcs in conjunction with predicting the evolution of nitrate concentrations but they provided only a limited assessment of the uncertainty of their results several sources of uncertainty need to be assessed when determining age distributions and predicting nitrate concentrations these include but are not limited to i uncertainty in defining a suitable conceptual model of the system bredehoeft 2005 ii uncertainty of the tracer measurements and iii uncertainty in additional aquifer parameters that are needed to calibrate models or estimate the time lag in the usz for example while uncertainties of tracer measurements are often reported the resulting uncertainties in estimated parameters age distributions mean ages and predicted nitrate concentrations are rarely calculated rigorously approaches to deal with uncertainty typically include sensitivity calculations and calculations of how quickly the goodness of fit decreases for a change in a parameter value e g corcho alvarado et al 2007 onnis 2008 schwientek et al 2009 and comparing results for different lpms or different tracers with each other corcho alvarado et al 2007 e g johnston et al 1998 osenbrück et al 2006 green et al 2014 assessed the bias due to model selection and found that while the obtained age distributions can be very different for different models they tend to produce similar mean ages and even more similar predictions of solute concentrations implying that uncertainty associated with model selection is of minor importance for the prediction of the evolution of nitrate concentrations a new bayesian modeling approach to estimate age distributions and their uncertainties resulting from measurement errors and additional model parameters in a more rigorous way was introduced by massoudieh et al 2012 and applied and extended in two follow up studies of relatively simple systems alikhani et al 2016 massoudieh et al 2014 in this study we measured multiple environmental tracers and nitrate to estimate age distributions and predict nitrate concentrations with the bayesian statistical framework of alikhani et al 2016 in an aquifer with a thick unsaturated zone multiple pumping wells and piezometers in the dünnerngäu solothurn switzerland were sampled to determine how quickly already implemented nitrate reduction measures will result in a trend reversal of nitrate concentrations multiple tracers were used to characterize the groundwater age distribution on a time scale of a few years to decades 3h tritiogenic 3he poreda et al 1988 schlosser et al 1988 radiogenic 4he e g torgersen and stute 2013 85kr althaus et al 2009 loosli et al 2000 smethie et al 1992 and 39ar loosli 1983 loosli et al 2000 the bayesian statistical framework of alikhani et al 2016 allows us to estimate confidence intervals for the age distributions and predicted nitrate concentrations due to the thick usz of the study area a special focus is given to the role of the usz which is explicitly included in the lpm measurements in the usz were performed to corroborate our model of the usz results are discussed with respect to the effect that explicitly including the usz in the lpm has on the estimated age distributions and modeled nitrate concentrations furthermore we assess the relative importance of tracer measurements and nitrate time series to obtain reliable and accurate estimates finally the combination of several environmental tracers including 3h with the nitrate time series enables us to estimate the travel times in the unsaturated and saturated zones separately 2 study area the dünnerngäu aquifer located in the canton of solothurn switzerland is an important source of drinking water in an intensely farmed region of the central lowlands of switzerland affected by high nitrate concentrations the main crops are grains corn potatoes vegetables and hay extensive application of mineral fertilizer and manure led to increasing nitrate concentrations in leachate and ultimately in groundwater in the 80s and 90s nitrate concentrations today are generally above the environmental quality target of 25 mg l set by the swiss legislation and even close to the swiss tolerance value for drinking water of 40 mg l at some of the wells fig 1 in 1999 the canton of solothurn initiated a program of nitrate reduction measures in order to meet the water quality targets for drinking water primarily by adapted cultivation techniques and secondarily by transforming cropland to extensive meadows the area of cropland farmed with adapted cultivation techniques increased steadily until 2010 to approximately 890 ha and by then 120 ha of cropland had been converted to extensive meadows see fig a1 in the electronic appendix hunkeler et al 2015 together this constitutes 89 of the agricultural area in the project perimeter and 26 of the total area of the aquifer 41 km2 based on a 2 d particle tracking model implemented at the start of the nitrate reduction measures in 2000 nitrate concentrations were expected to decrease within a few years of the changes in cultivation geotechnisches institut tk consult 1999 while there was a small initial decrease in nitrate concentrations in the pumping wells concentrations remained constant or increased again after 2005 fig 1 this unexpected behavior could either be due to ineffective nitrate reduction measures or due to an underestimation of the travel times possibly because the particle tracking model disregarded the thick unsaturated zone the nitrate input into the groundwater fig 1 was estimated based on mineral fertilizer application rates in switzerland cornaz et al 2005 which were scaled to a maximum nitrate concentration of 60 mg l corresponding to 64 kg of nitrate n ha yr depending on the recharge rate assumed for conversion similar to maximum concentrations that were previously observed in a similar study area in switzerland baillieux et al 2014 for the time before 1975 no data were available and an exponential increase from 10 mg l 11 kg n ha yr in 1910 to 37 mg l 39 kg n ha yr in 1975 was assumed the average nitrate concentrations of recharge in agricultural parcels where land use changes had already been implemented for several years were quantified based on nitrogen balances and measurements of vadose zone nitrate concentrations an average nitrate concentration of 35 mg l 37 kg n ha yr was obtained after the start of the nitrate reduction program in 2000 nitrate input concentrations were thus assumed to decrease proportionally to the increase of the area with adapted cultivation techniques reaching a concentration of 35 mg l in 2010 when most of the farmers were participating in the program see fig a1 in the electronic appendix nitrate concentrations are expected to decrease to 30 mg l 32 kg n ha yr by 2020 due to the conversion of cropland to grassland the hills and mountains surrounding the dünnerngäu are mostly covered by forests and grasslands and nitrate loads are thus considerably lower there geologically the dünnerngäu aquifer is bounded by the jura mountains limestone in the north and the gäu hills molasse in the south fig 2 it consists mostly of unconsolidated gravel deposited after the glacial retreat at the end of the würm glacial in the eastern part the aquifer is in direct contact with limestone from the late jurassic pasquier 1986 in the western part the aquifer and the limestone are separated by marly molasses from the oligocene and miocene chattien aquitanien and clayey silt pasquier 1986 in large parts of the aquifer the gravel is overlain by 1 3 m of clayey silt but the gravel may contain significant proportions of finer material in other areas as well hunkeler et al 2015 the general groundwater flow direction is from oensingen in the southwest towards olten in the northeast along the main axis of the system fig 2 the saturated zone sz is typically between 30 and 55 m thick along the main axis and thins out towards the jura mountains and the gäu hills hunkeler et al 2015 the unsaturated zone usz in turn decreases in thickness from the upstream part of the aquifer towards the downstream part see fig 2 water balance modeling showed that direct diffuse recharge by precipitation infiltration from streams and lateral inflows from the jura mountains and gäu hills each contribute roughly a third to the total groundwater recharge of around 1000 mm yr geotechnisches institut tk consult 1999 hunkeler et al 2015 pasquier 2000 the lower nitrate concentrations in infiltrating stream water and lateral inflows dilute the high nitrate concentrations in the direct recharge the lateral inflows of mountain block recharge mbr from the jura mountains might exhibit a wide range of travel times from fast episodic shallow subsurface flows to slow flows along much longer and deeper flow paths with long travel times pasquier 1986 3 methods 3 1 sampling and analytical methods samples were collected over the course of two years from september 2011 to october 2013 compared to the long term average groundwater levels were low in 2011 and rose to average levels in 2013 in the pumping wells water was pumped from near the top of the water column with the installed pumps in the piezometers water was extracted with submersible pumps mp1 the wells were flushed several times before sampling and field parameters ph temperature electrical conductivity and oxygen saturation were monitored with multi parameter portable meters hach hq30d in total 6 pumping wells and 50 shallow piezometers were sampled most of them multiple times however this paper focuses on the six pumping wells characterized in table 1 water samples for major ion measurements including no3 were filtered in the field and the cation samples acidified with concentrated nitric acid 10 hno3 to stabilize them subsequently samples were measured by ion chromatography dionex dx 120 at the university of neuchâtel for the analysis of hco3 the samples were titrated with 0 1 n hcl the analytical uncertainty of the chemical analyses is 5 and the error in the charge balance was 5 for all samples the δ15n and δ18o stable isotopes of no3 were analyzed by isotope ratio mass spectrometry irms at the university of waterloo canada for 85kr and 39ar measurements 500 2500 l of water were degassed in the field from the extracted gas kr and ar were isolated by preparative gas chromatography lu et al 2014 purtschert et al 2013 riedmann and purtschert 2016 yokochi 2016 the isotopic abundances of 85kr and 39ar were then determined by low level gas proportional counting at the university of bern loosli 1983 loosli et al 1986 loosli and purtschert 2005 results for 85kr are reported in the unit of dpm cckr which stands for the number of 85kr decays per minute per ml stp of kr gas activities of 39ar are given in modern ar relative to the atmospheric activity concentration of 1 78 mbq lar loosli et al 2000 typical relative measurement uncertainties are 5 10 for 39ar and 5 for 85kr samples for dissolved noble gas analyses 3he 4he 20ne were collected in copper tubes aeschbach hertig and solomon 2012 beyerle et al 2000 and analyzed by mass spectrometry at the university of bremen in germany sültenfuβ et al 2009 the analytical error is typically better than 1 for the noble gas concentrations and better than 0 5 for the he isotopic ratio tritium was electrolytically enriched and measured by liquid scintillation counting lsc at the hydroisotop gmbh germany on 1l of water with an uncertainty of typically 1 tu tritium unit to characterize the water content and nitrate concentrations in the usz six vertical soil cores of up to 10 m depth were taken and analyzed the cores were collected by rotary drilling in double core barrels without using water to avoid modification of the pore water composition the cores were extruded from the inner core barrel with a piston with minimal disturbance samples of 100 g were immediately placed in air tight centrifuge containers then a known amount of water was added to the filled containers for nitrate extraction the containers were placed on a shaker for 24 h before they were centrifuged to separate the solid and the liquid phases the liquid phase was filtered and analyzed for no3 by ion chromatography these measurements were then corrected for the dilution by the water added for the extraction the wet weight of the soil was compared to the weight of the dried solid phase to determine the gravimetric water content of the soil two additional multi level boreholes were drilled in the usz near soil core locations to extract soil gas for 85kr analyses see fig 2 these were installed using the direct push technique of the sealed multiport sampling system smps ducommun et al 2013 thereby the individual levels are isolated from each other by an injected mixture of cement and bentonite gas tightness to the atmosphere and between the screen levels was verified by measuring co2 and ch4 concentrations of the extracted air the latter was injected at one level and monitored in the adjacent levels 3 2 estimation of travel times in lumped parameter models lpm the observed concentration ci t is related to the input concentration ci 0 t of tracer i by means of a simplified analytical function ρi t that represents the travel time distribution of the groundwater e g zuber and maloszewski 2001 1 c i t 0 c i 0 t t ρ i t e λ i t dt where the last term represents a first order reaction such as radioactive decay for a stable tracer the decay constant λi is set to zero travel time distributions are characterized by one or several parameters such as the mean travel time or a measure of dispersive mixing when solving the inverse problem of estimating these parameters and others given measured tracer concentrations in groundwater and the tracer input history it is desirable to propagate uncertainties from for example the concentration measurements to obtain uncertainties for the estimated parameters and travel time distributions 3 2 1 tracer input functions input concentrations ci 0 t for 85kr are based on measurements from the bfs bundesamt für strahlenschutz station in freiburg i br winger et al 2005 for 39ar a constant atmospheric concentration was assumed loosli 1983 the 3h input is based on data from the closest monitoring station of the global network for isotopes in precipitation gnip constance iaea wmo 2014 local emissions of 3h from the watch making industry in the studied area althaus et al 2009 were considered with a constant offset from the constance values the best match between measurements and model was obtained for an offset of 7 tu for pre bomb waters before 1953 a constant 3h concentration of 5 tu was assumed roether 1967 nitrate can be included in the model as an additional tracer sensitive to the travel time of water in the usz if denitrification is negligible or can otherwise be quantified providing an additional constraint alikhani et al 2016 the nitrate rich water from intensely farmed areas is diluted with water low in nitrate typically 10 mg l in the study area originating from streams or recharge from the surrounding hillslopes to account for this the nitrate input function see fig 1 is scaled by a dilution factor d a side effect of that dilution factor is also that an error in the assumed maximum of the nitrate input history will mainly affect the dilution factor but not other parameters as long as the shape of the input history is approximately correct for the old component see below a constant nitrate input of 10 mg l is assumed 3 2 2 travel time distributions conceptually the study area is divided into three compartments as illustrated in fig 3 the saturated zone sz the unsaturated zone usz and a compartment contributing old groundwater from below simple and commonly used lpms such as the exponential model em represent the saturated zone compartment only while the model used here does explicitly include the other two compartments lpms require a high degree of simplification and idealization for each compartment all three compartments as well as recharge to the unsaturated and saturated zone are assumed to be homogeneous the thickness of the saturated zone is assumed to be constant in contrast the usz is represented by a wedge shape with linearly decreasing thickness from 30 m to 0 m along the main axis of the aquifer as a simple approximation of the decreasing thickness of the usz along the groundwater flow direction in the study area see fig 2 the model only considers the vertical dimension depth z and one horizontal dimension distance x along main axis of the aquifer see fig 2 the upstream boundary is a no flow boundary there is a groundwater divide south west of well 1 this simplified conceptual model does not distinguish explicitly between recharge from streams through agricultural fields or adjacent hill slopes as this would result in an overly complex lpm relative to the available data the following paragraphs explain in detail how the three compartments were included in the mathematical model of the residence time distributions the saturated zone in isolation meets the conditions of the exponential model first proposed by vogel 1967 resulting in an exponential age distribution for wells screened over the whole aquifer thickness for partially screened wells as is the case in this study the youngest and or the oldest water components are not extracted partial exponential model pem jurgens et al 2012 the cut off age s are a function of the known depth of the screened interval see table 1 for well screens for the em and the pem the travel time of groundwater entering the well at depth z below the water table is given by cook and böhlke 2000 as 2 t gw z t 0 ln z z z where t0 is the mean residence time and z is the thickness of the saturated zone furthermore we relate the depth z below the water table to the horizontal position x where the flow path originated see fig 3 by cook and böhlke 2000 3 x x j z j z z j where zj is the total saturated thickness and xj is the distance of well j from the upstream boundary of the aquifer this allows us to express the travel time along individual flow paths in the idealized saturated zone as a function of x which will be useful for integrating the unsaturated zone moreover eq 3 also defines the contributing area along distance x of each well given its screen depth there are partial overlaps between the contributing areas of several wells however the overlaps are smaller in reality than in the model geotechnisches institut tk consult 1999 because the wells are offset perpendicular to the main axis of the aquifer to various degrees there is no comprehensive yet simple way of considering the usz in the travel time distributions of lpms the usz can either be incorporated through apparent travel time distributions which differ for different tracers depending on their mode of transport in the usz or alternatively the travel time can be defined as the time the water spends in the sz only correcting the tracer input functions to the water table cook and solomon 1995 presented the governing differential equations for transport in both phases in the usz and derived an analytical solution for exponentially increasing atmospheric concentrations of gaseous tracers under specific conditions however for the general case no analytical solution of these equations is available consequently simplified approximations have to be used e g osenbrück et al 2006 or the equations have to be solved numerically e g corcho alvarado et al 2009 2007 rueedi et al 2005 all these studies with lpms assumed a uniform thickness of the usz for the entire study area corcho alvarado et al 2007 rueedi et al 2005 or for each well individually osenbrück et al 2006 so far only schwientek et al 2009 have considered a spatially variable thickness of the usz of single wells apart from 2d or 3d hydrogeological models where this is more common onnis 2008 zoellmann et al 2001 here we present a new approach that allows for an usz with variable thickness to be included in an extended lpm model for parameter estimation typically eq 1 is integrated numerically in contrast to this and similar to schwientek et al s 2009 moving particle approach we numerically integrate a large number of flow paths over the screen depth the total travel time for tracer i along a single flow line intersecting the well at depth z ttot i z is given by the sum of the tracer specific travel time or apparent time lag for gaseous tracers further discussed below in the unsaturated zone tusz i z and the travel time tgw z in the saturated zone see eq 2 the tracer specific travel time distributions can be obtained by aggregating all flow paths intersecting the contributing depth interval well screen plus a margin of 4 m above and below for production wells in addition to the flow paths through the usz and sz slow mountain block recharge is included in the model as an admixed old component with proportion m and a piston flow age told fig 3 overall the concentration ci t of tracer i at time t at the well can thus be calculated by 4 c i t mc i 0 t old 1 m f 1 n 1 n c i 0 t gw z t usz i z e λ i t gw z t usz i z where n is the total number of flow paths f intersecting the contributing depth interval z z f is the equidistantly spaced depth at which flow path f intersects the well and λi is the radioactive decay constant of tracer i λi 0 for a stable tracer one important factor affecting the travel time in the usz tusz i z is the spatially variable thickness of the usz h x using eq 3 h x can easily be written as h x z the wedge shape of the usz results in a wider age distribution of the water in the wells than would be obtained for a usz of constant thickness especially for wells with a long screen for tracers transported in the aqueous phase of the usz a dispersion model dm with mean travel time tusz w h x z h x z vusz w and dispersion parameter δ is used with vusz w the mean seepage velocity same for all flow paths transport of gases in the usz is modeled with a simplified analytical solution of the governing equations described in cook and solomon 1995 they derived an analytical solution for stable gaseous tracers with exponentially increasing atmospheric concentrations in the usz this solution can be adapted for tracers with a first order decay and constant atmospheric concentrations to give the apparent time lag tusz g i of tracer i at the water table relative to the surface 5 t usz g i h x 1 λ i ln cosh h x λ i d i eff θ g with d i eff d i 0 θ g τ g where h x is the thickness of the unsaturated zone d i 0 the diffusion coefficient in air of tracer i d i eff the effective diffusion coefficient θ g the gas filled porosity and 0 τg 1 the tortuosity coefficient of the gas filled pore space because the diffusion coefficient is different for every tracer the apparent time lag is also tracer specific fortunately the diffusion coefficients are well known and do not introduce additional parameters that need to be estimated the assumption of a constant atmospheric concentration is correct for 39ar and approximately valid for 85kr during the last 10 20 years winger et al 2005 for tritiogenic 3he and the radiogenic 4he eq 5 is not applicable because they accumulate in the subsurface because of the large diffusion coefficient of he 3he and 4he are assumed to be in equilibrium with the atmosphere throughout the usz solomon and cook 2000 so that tritiogenic 3he and radiogenic 4he are zero at the water table 3 2 3 parameter and uncertainty estimation in total there are nine fit parameters for each pumping well table 2 which are constrained by two to six tracer measurements per well and the nitrate time series all fit parameters are assumed to be log normally distributed and temporally constant that is transient effects on residence times and the functioning of the flow system are not considered the 4he accumulation rate a the dispersion parameter δ and the gas filled porosity in the unsaturated zone θg are chosen as global parameters i e the same for all wells furthermore the age of the old component told was only considered for wells where 39ar or 4he were measured wells 1 2 and 5 all other parameters are well specific thus in total there are 3 3 5 6 36 parameters which are constrained by 24 tracer measurements and several hundred nitrate measurements without the nitrate data this model is underdetermined without further constraints on the parameter space additional constraints can be obtained from relationships between different parameters of the model or from a priori knowledge of the hydrogeological situation firstly the seepage rate in the usz rusz and the groundwater recharge rate in the sz rgw can be calculated from the model parameters 6 z θ t 0 1 m r gw r usz v usz w θ w where θ θ w θ g where θ is the total porosity θ w is the water filled porosity in the usz and z the thickness of the sz in a perfect system rusz and rgw would be exactly the same but here they are only assumed to be approximately the same because of considerable uncertainties in some of the parameters in these equations which are not fitted secondly an empirical relationship exists between the tortuosity coefficient τg and the gas filled porosity θ g millington and quirk 1961 7 τ g θ g 7 3 θ 2 which is also assumed to be only approximately true thirdly rgw is constrained to r0 1000 700 mm 1σ based on estimates of the recharge rate from previous studies hunkeler et al 2015 the uncertainty of r0 is assumed to be so large not only because these estimates were quite uncertain but also because the recharge rate might vary for the contributing area of the different pumping wells and because the estimate of 1000 mm would be too high if the old component which does not contribute to rgw in the model is a large fraction of the water originating from the jura mountains 30 overall these relations add a total of 3 6 18 constraining equations the overlap of some contributing areas was not used as an additional constraint on the well specific parameters of the respective wells because it is unclear how a partial overlap should be included simply making all parameters global for wells with only a small overlap in contributing areas clearly does not seem appropriate to fit the parameters and estimate their uncertainty the metropolis hastings algorithm mcmc metropolis et al 1953 was used with the following acceptance probability of a new state x given state x 8 p x x min 1 e ξ x e ξ x where 9 ξ x j i c meas ji c mod ji x 2 σ ji 2 j r gw j x r usz j x 2 σ r 1 2 θ θ w j x θ g j x 2 σ θ 2 r gw j x r 0 2 σ r 2 2 where σji is the standard deviation of the observations the first term represents how well the model tracer concentrations agree with the measured tracer concentrations the second term represents the constraints of eqs 6 and 7 and the estimate of the recharge rate how strict these constraints are followed is determined by the value of σr1 σr and σ θ σ disregards the constraints completely whereas σ 0 enforces them perfectly here the σ were chosen to reflect the uncertainty of a priori parameters which are part of the respective equations to obtain a more balanced weighting of the different tracers especially when combining tracers few measurements and nitrate time series many measurements with relatively low measurement uncertainty the uncertainty of 39ar measurements few measurements with high uncertainty was halved to increase their weight and the weight of nitrate measurements was decreased by a factor of 4 to 10 depending on the length of the time series new proposals for the mcmc algorithm were generated in a similar way to turner and sederberg 2012 an initial burn in period before reaching convergence was discarded six different scenarios were investigated to assess the value of tracers and nitrate time series and the importance of explicitly including the usz for modeling and predicting nitrate concentrations see table 3 for the models without usz the nitrate and tracer input was directly applied at the water table i e tusz i 0 and the parameters only relevant for the usz were neglected τg θ g vusz w and δ depending on the scenario burn in periods of up to a hundred thousand samples were required after which a hundred thousand samples were generated using the mcmc algorithm for the scenarionu we found that the number of fit parameters was too high and the correlation between them too strong to give meaningful results to reduce this problem the mean seepage velocity in the usz was also made a global parameter in this scenario 4 results 4 1 chemistry and stable isotopes signatures of major ion composition and stable isotopes of the water are similar for all pumping wells with the exception of well1 for example measured bicarbonate concentrations vary only slightly from 359 to 377 mg l table 4 only nitrate concentrations exhibit a larger relative variability ranging from 27 1 to 39 2 mg l fig 4 little temporal variation in concentrations of major ions was observed over the period of the three sampling campaigns measured stable isotopes of the water are in the range found in local precipitation schotterer et al 2000 well 1 differs from the others by having lower nitrate and bicarbonate concentrations and a slightly more negative stable isotope signature measurements in the shallow piezometers near well 1 confirm this observation see fig 4 and fig a2 the more negative isotope signature of the water from well 1 is likely related to a higher recharge altitude because the well is located close to a transverse valley intersecting the jura mountain chain and draining water from the jura mountains this water is low in nitrate and bicarbonate thus also explaining the observed differences in the chemical signature nitrate scales approximately linearly with bicarbonate in pumping wells and shallow piezometers indicating a mixing of at least two water types fig a3 in the electronic appendix i water high in nitrate and bicarbonate 40 mg l and 400 mg l respectively and ii water low in nitrate and bicarbonate concentrations approximately 10 mg l and 270 mg l respectively type i derives from diffuse recharge of local precipitation water of type ii is contributed by unpolluted water from the jura mountains recharge from the streams in the study area or water from the transverse valley the measured stable isotope signature of nitrate δ15n and δ18o table 4 agrees best with the isotopic signature of soil n kendall and caldwell 1998 see fig a4 in the electronic appendix however the nitrate could also derive from mineral fertilizer and manure with a larger contribution from manure than from mineral fertilizer the isotopes of the nitrate show no sign of denitrification with the exception of one shallow piezometer this is in accordance with the oxic conditions which prevail throughout the aquifer see table 4 consequentially nitrate is considered to show a conservative behavior in this study six profiles in the usz show large variations of water content and nitrate concentrations between profiles and as a function of depth the profiles generally show a decreasing water content with depth which is related to the progressively coarser material with depth depth averaged water contents range from 10 to 19 wt there is no clear trend in nitrate concentrations with depth which could confirm the effectiveness of the nitrate reduction measures for more details see hunkeler et al 2015 4 2 tracers of travel time measured activities of 85kr in the usz decrease significantly with depth fig 5 and are up to 28 lower than the modern atmospheric value 2011 of approximately 75 dpm cckr concentration profiles of 85kr in the usz were calculated for several values of the gas phase tortuosity coefficient τg assuming a constant porosity with depth a fixed depth of the water table see fig 5 and a no flux boundary at the water table cook and solomon 1995 values of τg from 0 06 to 0 10 agree best with the measured concentrations fig 5 measured concentrations at the wells are shown in fig 6 see also table a1 in the electronic appendix activities of 85kr of 30 dpm cckr and 3h activities of 8 to 14 tu indicate that a large fraction of the water is younger than 30 years well1 also contains a considerable fraction of old water 60 years and thus 85kr and 3h free as indicated by an 39ar activity of 77 3 modern and an elevated 4herad concentration simple piston flow or exponential model ages calculated from 3h 3he are systematically smaller on average by about 4 years than the same model ages calculated from 85kr this time difference is attributed to the effect of the usz and the corresponding delay of 85kr at the water table whereas 3hetrit and 4herad in the usz are strongly diluted by the additional he in the gas phase so that they their accumulation in the usz is negligible 4 3 modeling results 4 3 1 concentrations of travel time tracers the six scenarios differ in their ability to reproduce the measured tracer concentrations generally scenarios only relying on tracer measurements and scenarios including the usz perform better in this respect fig 6 as expected measured tracer concentrations are best reproduced by scenariotu using tracer concentrations only and including the usz modeled tracer concentrations are close to or within the 1σ 67 confidence interval of the measured concentrations and vice versa for all 85kr 4he and 3he measurements with the exception of 85kr in well1 the model is not as successful in reproducing the 3h and 39ar data for 3h this might be due to spatially and temporally varying local emissions which are not considered by the constant offset of 7 tu for scenariotu the estimated model uncertainty of tracer concentrations is generally 2 3 times smaller than the reported measurement uncertainty for all tracers including nitrate as a primary fit objective e g scenariontu reduces the relative weight of the tracer measurements resulting in an increased discrepancy between modeled and measured tracer concentrations when comparing scenariotu with scenariontu this is especially the case for 3h fig 6 tritium is affected most because it is transported in exactly the same way as nitrate in contrast transport of the other tracers depends on additional parameters such as the 4he accumulation rate a which can compensate for changes in the parameters that determine the transport of nitrate however when nitrate alone is the primary fit objective scenarionu this compensation mechanism is not sufficient anymore and discrepancies between measured and modeled concentrations increase for 3h 3he and 85kr fig 6 scenarionu also has 2 5 times larger uncertainties of the modeled tracers indicating that only using nitrate as a fit objective has limited ability to constrain the transport of these tracers not including the unsaturated zone in the model generally results in a poorer reproduction of the measured tracer concentrations especially for 3h in scenarios nt and t compared to ntu and tu fig 6 however if only nitrate is used as a primary fit objective measured tracer concentrations are sometimes better reproduced if the usz is not included in the model scenarion this is attributed to the fact that the mean seepage velocity in scenarionu was used as a global parameter whereas in scenarion it was a local one the uncertainty of modeled tracer concentrations is relatively independent of whether the model includes an usz or not 4 3 2 range and sensitivity of fit parameters uncertainties of estimated fit parameters are smaller than the range of the prior indicating the usefulness of the data for parameter estimation the range of obtained values for each fit parameter and for the recharge rate are given in table 5 the complete results for each scenario and pumping well are given in the supplementary material table a2 uncertainties are similar for scenarios ntu nt tu and t and larger for the nitrate only scenarios nu and n indicating that nitrate measurements alone are not able to constrain the parameters as much as the tracer data estimated values of a fit parameter for an individual pumping well are often similar for all six scenarios for example wells 2 and 5 consistently have the longest mean groundwater residence time t0 scenarios without the usz generally result in mean groundwater residence times t0 that are 2 5 years longer in compensation for not considering the delay of the usz 4 3 3 age distributions all pumping wells contain a significant fraction of water that is only a few years old and much of the water of the young component is less than 10 to 15 years old fig 7 exceptions are wells 2 and 5 which are not containing any water younger than 2 and 5 years respectively this is in agreement with the fact that in these two wells the distance between the water table and the top of the screen is largest 20 m whereas in wells 9 and 10 for example it is only 5 m the cumulative age distributions for the investigated pumping wells vary between the scenarios as fig 7 shows only scenarios nt and t have almost identical age distributions and related uncertainties for all wells except well10 uncertainties of the cumulative age distributions are smallest for scenario nt followed by scenariontu and largest for scenarios nu and n part of this increased uncertainty when only using nitrate as a fit objective comes from a higher uncertainty in the fraction of the old water component m the estimated fraction m also is considerably larger when only fitting nitrate 47 75 for well 1 and typically 10 23 for the other pumping wells compared to 26 38 and typically 10 respectively for scenarios including tracers the problem is that in scenarios nu and n m and d are highly correlated because contrary to the other four scenarios m is not constrained by additional tracer measurements total mean travel times ttot usz and sz combined across all pumping wells and scenarios range from 0 6 to 25 4 years table 6 for individual wells values obtained for different scenarios show less spread but still vary by 5 16 years see table a3 in the electronic appendix inter scenario variability is thus considerably larger than the uncertainty estimated for ttot e g 2 4 years for scenariontu table 6 travel times for wells 2 and 5 tend to be larger when including the tracer data and smaller when including the nitrate data fig 7 this pattern applies not only to total travel times but also to travel times in the unsaturated zone for models where it is included disregarding the old component 30 58 of the total travel time is spent in the unsaturated zone table 6 including the old component which does not have an unsaturated zone in the model reduces the mean travel time in the unsaturated zone to 1 25 of the total mean travel time with a few exceptions in wells 2 and 5 the relative proportions of travel time in the usz for a specific pumping well tusz ttot are similar for all scenarios table 6 the apparent time lag of 85kr in the unsaturated zone varies from 25 to 100 of tusz the travel time of water through the usz is thus larger than the time lag for gases 4 3 4 nitrate modeled nitrate concentrations for all scenarios agree similarly well with observed time series for all pumping wells except well 2 and 5 fig 8 in well 2 the observed time series has two distinct concentration peaks and modeled concentrations for the nitrate only scenarios nu and n are aligned with the first peak whereas modeled concentrations for the tracer only scenario tu are aligned with the second peak modeled concentrations for the scenarios including both nitrate and tracers have the peak concentration in the middle between these observed peaks well 5 which has a single peak shows a similar shift to a later peak concentration for tracer based scenarios the degree to which the model can explain the measured data r2 values depends strongly on the individual wells and ranges from a few to over 80 the strikingly low correlation coefficient in wells 2 and 10 for scenario nu compared to other scenarios is caused by making vusz w a global variable in that scenario whereas it is a well specific variable for the other scenarios while median modeled nitrate concentrations are similar for different scenarios differences between the six scenarios are larger concerning the width of the credible intervals of the modeled concentrations and the modeled peak nitrate concentration especially if the observed time series begins when nitrate concentrations are already declining wells6 and 10 in fig 8 credible intervals are generally largest for the tracer only scenarios and smallest for scenarios ntu and nt which use both tracer and nitrate data with the nitrate only scenarios having intermediate credible intervals however for the pumping wells where the peak nitrate concentration is not part of the observed time series nitrate only scenarios have the largest credible intervals especially in well 6 there is also a large difference between the two nitrate only scenarios with scenario nu and n estimating peak nitrate concentration of approximately 32 mg l and 42 mg l relatively most scenarios predict that none of the pumping wells has crossed or will cross in the future the tolerance value for drinking water set by the swiss authorities thanks to decreasing nitrate inputs all scenarios indicate that once the nitrate reductions measures become fully effective nitrate concentrations should fall below the legislative target value of 25 mg l for all wells for wells 6 9 and 10 all scenarios predict similar timing with concentrations falling below the target concentration in approximately 2018 2020 and 2015 respectively for wells 2 and 5 the tracer only scenarios indicate a much slower response to the nitrate reduction measures than the other scenarios in these wells achieving the target value will not happen before 2030 and 2020 respectively but could be delayed until 2050 for well2 no matter how different the age distribution and thus the timing of the decline in nitrate concentrations the concentration that can ultimately be reached once the nitrate measures are fully effective is similar for most scenarios as it only depends on the estimated dilution factor and to a lesser extent on the fraction of old water m an exception is scenario n which predicts a higher final nitrate concentration for well 6 than the other scenarios fig 8 5 discussion in this study we employed environmental tracers and nitrate time series to estimate travel time distributions of groundwater and predict the future evolution of nitrate concentrations modeled nitrate concentrations agree with observed nitrate time series for most pumping wells and scenarios all scenarios that use tracer data can also reasonably well reproduce the tracer measurements fig 6 by combining tracer data and nitrate time series with a lpm that explicitly considers the usz we are able to separate travel times in the sz and usz on one hand the low computational costs of lpms allow for a thorough assessment of uncertainties associated with calculated travel time distributions and nitrate predictions on the other hand the simplifications inherent in the lpm approach can lead to questionable results in a few specific cases the main implication for the dünnerngäu aquifer is that total travel times of water and nitrate are longer than previously thought mainly due to the delay in the usz which has been neglected in the particle tracking model used for the previous estimate geotechnisches institut tk consult 1999 for nitrate including the travel time in the usz doubles the total travel time for most wells table 6 disregarding the old component resulting in a slower reaction to nitrate reduction measures consequentially nitrate concentrations at some of the wells will exceed the target value until 2040 considerable retardation of gaseous tracers in the usz was validated by 85kr measurements in the usz fig 5 none of the scenarios can fully reproduce some of the multi annual fluctuations of the nitrate time series fig 8 indicating that other processes are also modifying nitrate concentrations in the pumping wells these could range from climatic effects on the nitrate input function dry years leading to an enrichment of nitrate in the soil column to shifting groundwater flow paths and mixing under changing hydrological conditions an assessment of such processes would require a more detailed and transient hydrogeological model 3d or at least 2d usz 5 1 reliability and suitability of the model lumped parameter models are very simplified representations of flow dynamics and processes in real aquifers therefore some aspects that might be important cannot be included which may lead to biased results for example the limitation to two dimensions means that lateral inflows of groundwater cannot be considered appropriately which might partially explain the discrepancy between rusz and rgw see table 5 these lateral inflows could also have infiltrated through an usz with different characteristics than local direct infiltration furthermore the model assumes that parameters such as porosity and recharge rates are homogeneous for the contributing area of each well this results e g in the dispersion parameter not representing actual hydrodynamic dispersion but rather locally varying recharge rates porosity or deviations of usz thickness from the idealized model in fig 3 despite this note of caution in the following model estimates of field observables such as porosity are compared to alternative sources of information in the saturated zone rgw not including the old component varies spatially ranging from 680 to 4570 mm yr for well1 average of all six scenarios 2810 mm yr scenario ntu 2760 mm yr to 310 680 mm yr for well 2 average 460 mm yr scenario ntu 480 mm yr table 5 well 1 is located close to the upstream boundary of the aquifer where the assumption of a constant thickness of the aquifer is likely not met additionally the chemistry and stable isotopic signature suggest that a sizeable proportion of the water in well 1 derives from the mountains for well1 the model might thus not be completely suitable averaged over all other wells and all six scenarios rgw is 860 mm yr the highest and lowest recharge rates for a well often result from one of the nitrate only scenarios nu and n whereas scenario ntu consistently results in recharge rates that are in the midrange of all scenarios this indicates that the results of scenario ntu are more robust than those of scenarios relying on nitrate alone differences in recharge rates between wells might indicate different proportions of local recharge from precipitation versus lateral groundwater inflows from the hills and recharge from streams however values of some wells might also be biased due to simplifications of the lumped parameter model such as assuming that the thickness of the saturated zone at the well is representative of the thickness of the saturated zone over the whole contributing area seepage rates in the unsaturated zone as darcy velocities are generally smaller than rgw with an overall average excluding well1 of 720 mm yr 17 less than rgw taking into account the average dilution factor of 0 53 these estimates suggest that direct local recharge from precipitation is on the order of 380 460 mm yr a direct comparison with the recharge rates estimated in previous studies total recharge 1000 mm yr local recharge from direct precipitation 330 mm yr is difficult because of the different spatial scales and because these studies distinguish local direct recharge from precipitation infiltration from streams and lateral inflows from the mountains and hills surrounding the aquifer hunkeler et al 2015 paratte 2013 pasquier 2000 tk consult 2001 whereas the current model only distinguishes between an old and a young component nonetheless our results are of a similar magnitude as in these reports in the usz tortuosity coefficients and the partition of the porosity into water and gas phase also have a relative direct physical meaning fitted tortuosity coefficients for wells 2 10 and scenarios ntu and tu range from 0 08 to 0 18 with a typical uncertainty of 0 03 and an unweighted mean of 0 13 table 5 these values are close to the coefficients derived independently from the 85kr profiles fig 5 of approximately 0 06 0 10 scenario nu nitrate only results in considerably higher values and a large uncertainty well 1 has high tortuosity coefficients 0 22 0 46 for all three scenarios which together with the highest vusz of all pumping wells indicates that the thickness of the unsaturated zone in the contributing area of well 1 is smaller than the wedge shape suggests this is in agreement with the location of the well at the upstream boundary of the system where groundwater from the klus of balsthal which has a thinner usz still constitutes a significant part of the whole water mass see fig 2 the measured soil water content of the two profiles in the usz section 4 1 provides an estimate of θ w 20 30 and together with eq 7 and the tortuosity values from the 85kr profiles in the usz also of θ g 15 20 resulting in a total porosity of 35 50 the modeled θ g of 13 19 are in a similar range the modeled θ w in turn are smaller ranging from 11 to 17 only most likely because the total porosity θ was fixed in the model to 30 6 in the usz which is lower than the total porosity indicated by the profile data 35 50 we did not adjust the porosity in the model for several reasons firstly the profiles were taken from the top 8 10 m of the usz and porosity generally decreases with increasing depth resulting in a lower average porosity for the usz as a whole secondly the two profiles are only two points in space which do not necessarily represent the larger spatial average represented by the tracer based model results because soils with a high porosity often have a lower hydraulic conductivity e g clays finally any stagnant water for example in local clay lenses would be included in θ w as derived from the usz profiles whereas the fitted θ w represents the smaller effective porosity an important aspect not considered in our model is the effect of different travel times for nitrate rich and nitrate poor young water components comparing results of scenario tu with scenario ntu reveals that the performance of modeled tracer concentrations decreases most strongly for 3h when including nitrate as a primary fit objective this suggests that 3h and nitrate represent a different groundwater mix the dilution factor already implies the presence of at least two young water components one nitrate rich local direct infiltration and one nitrate poor e g lateral inflows or infiltration from streams tracer based estimates refer to the travel time distribution of the whole water sample whereas nitrate time series based estimates are biased towards the nitrate rich water component s an example of this effect can be seen at wells 2 and 5 where a comparison of scenarios nu ntu and tu imply a shorter mean travel time for the nitrate rich component than for the nitrate poor component fig 7 and consequently a different timing of nitrate trend reversal fig 8 further evidence for the presence of a water mass that is young but has a low nitrate concentration is that the dilution parameter is smaller than the fraction of young water 1 m and that m is much larger for the nitrate only scenarios 17 26 for wells 2 and 5 compared to 3 5 for scenarios including tracers an explicit modeling of these two water components would further increase the complexity of the model beyond a reasonable level for an lpm and the available calibration data implementing a 3d hydrogeological model would help to overcome some of the limitations of the lpm approach in these hydrogeologically complex settings green et al 2014 mccallum et al 2015 turnadge and smerdon 2014 visser et al 2009 but would introduce its own limitations again hydrogeological modeling would enable a proper incorporation of lateral inflows spatially varying recharge rates and aquifer properties and would also allow determining mixing between several young water components however hydrogeological models require not only more detailed data about aquifer geometry and properties but also enough suitable data for calibration of unknown parameters especially for the usz and the mixing of different water masses in the sz a calibration based on groundwater heads might not be sufficient and additional tracer data or measurements from the usz might be necessary for robust results schilling et al 2017 visser et al 2009 furthermore eberts et al 2012 showed that if analogous conceptual models are used lpms and hydrogeological models often result in very similar contaminant predictions finally due to the high computational costs involved in hydrogeological models they are not very suitable for an estimate of the uncertainty as thorough as done here for the lpm approach 5 2 the value of an explicit unsaturated zone tracer measurements and nitrate time series an explicit representation of the usz in the model allows for the separation of travel times in the usz and the sz at the cost of higher model complexity and thus higher demand on available measurements separating travel times in the usz and sz in a lpm is useful for examining processes that only take place in one of the zones but also for comparing results with results from other models which modeled usz and sz separately or only modeled one of them in contrast to hydrogeological models where omitting the usz leads to a serious underestimation of the total residence time not explicitly including the usz in an lpm model calibrated on tracer measurements leads to a much smaller bias similar mean travel times are obtained for both models because the missing usz is compensated for by a larger mean residence time t0 in the sz tables a2 and a3 in the electronic appendix although omitting the usz in a tracer calibrated lpm results in a similar total travel time it results in bias in other parameters for example the recharge rate of the sz obtained from t0 will be underestimated if the usz is not included in the model if only nitrate measurements are used for model calibration the parameters determining the travel times in the usz and sz mainly vusz w and t0 are highly correlated consequently one of the fit parameters vusz w had to be changed from well specific to global in scenario nu to obtain meaningful results as this caused unrealistic results for some of the wells the explicit modeling of the usz is not advisable if only nitrate time series are available for calibration combining nitrate time series with measurements of gaseous tracers enables a separation of travel times in the usz and the sz gaseous environmental tracers are excellent tools to determine travel times in the sz but do not provide any information on travel times of water in the usz because transport of gaseous tracers in the usz is different from transport of nitrate or 3h the strong correlation between vusz w and t0 is alleviated while time series of 3h might be similarly useful as time series of nitrate long nitrate time series are much more common combining gaseous tracers and nitrate time series thus creates a powerful tool to separate the travel times in the usz and sz the combination of environmental tracers and nitrate time series also improves parameter estimates and reduces the uncertainty of nitrate predictions for most wells scenarios that include tracer information generally result in physically more realistic parameter sets and reduced uncertainty for example for the recharge rates compared to scenarios which only use the nitrate time series to constrain the model regarding the prediction of the future evolution of nitrate concentrations the benefit of including tracer data is largest for pumping wells where nitrate time series are short and do not include the peak of the nitrate concentration history well 6 and 10 in fig 8 in this case the tracer data reduce uncertainty of the peak nitrate concentration the uncertainty of how nitrate concentrations will evolve and the uncertainty of what nitrate concentration is finally achievable for some wells with longer nitrate time series including tracer data does not result in a significant improvement well 2 and 5 our study also has implications for future assessments of nitrate reduction measures in other aquifers extending the statistical framework of alikhani et al 2016 to include an explicit usz we have shown that also in aquifers with a thick usz environmental tracers can be useful for obtaining better and more robust estimates of travel times and predictions of future nitrate concentrations moreover combining these tracers with a time series of any water borne compound that is not degraded in a specific aquifer such as nitrate in this study allows for a separation of the travel times of usz and sz this could be useful information especially if processes occurring in the usz or sz only are important furthermore nitrate measurements in profiles from the usz or samples from shallow piezometers would show much earlier whether nitrate reduction measures are effective the advantage of the latter is that the water sample originates from a larger area whereas the former will give a more plot specific answer however a few occasional measurements in shallow piezometers or the usz do not enable a reliable determination of the travel time from the surface to the piezometer for the water phase therefore a combination of a few shallow measurements with the approach presented here to provide an estimate of travel times in the usz seems to be a promising avenue finally this study has shown once more that hydrogeological modeling without ground truthing the results with suitable measurements can result in misleading conclusions especially if the data used for model calibration mostly reflects transport in the sz groundwater head data whereas the usz also is a considerable and important part of the system 6 conclusion environmental tracer measurements and nitrate time series were used to estimate travel times of groundwater and predict the future evolution of nitrate concentrations in an aquifer polluted by nitrate special emphasis was given to the thick unsaturated zone that decreases in thickness along the flow direction model parameters were estimated using a bayesian inference scheme that allows for an estimation of the joint error structure of these parameters our results show that the apparent underestimation of travel times in an earlier study based on a 2d hydrogeological model can be attributed to a disregard of the usz in that study by combining tracer data and nitrate time series a separation of the travel times in the unsaturated and saturated zone becomes possible different scenarios of model complexity with or without usz and data availability only nitrate time series only tracer measurements or both were evaluated we find that including tracer measurements reduces uncertainty in nitrate predictions if nitrate time series are not available or short but does not necessarily lead to better predictions if long nitrate time series are available however including tracer data generally results in

7275,groundwater quality in many regions with intense agriculture has deteriorated due to the leaching of nitrate and other agricultural pollutants modified agricultural practices can reduce the input of nitrate to groundwater bodies but it is crucial to determine the time span over which these measures become effective at reducing nitrate levels in pumping wells such estimates can be obtained from hydrogeological modeling or lumped parameter models lpm in combination with environmental tracer data two challenges in such tracer based estimates are i accounting for the different modes of transport in the unsaturated zone usz and ii assessing uncertainties here we extend a recently published bayesian inference scheme for simple lpms to include an explicit usz model and apply it to the dünnerngäu aquifer switzerland compared to a previous estimate of travel times in the aquifer based on a 2d hydrogeological model our approach provides a more accurate assessment of the dynamics of nitrate concentrations in the aquifer we find that including tracer measurements 3h 3he 85kr 39ar 4he reduces uncertainty in nitrate predictions if nitrate time series at wells are not available or short but does not necessarily lead to better predictions if long nitrate time series are available additionally the combination of tracer data with nitrate time series allows for a separation of the travel times in the unsaturated and saturated zone keywords nitrate pollution thick unsaturated zone groundwater dating lumped parameter model uncertainty estimation bayesian inference 1 introduction rising nitrate concentrations are negatively impacting the quality of drinking water around the world in some cases production wells are ultimately abandoned e g alikhani et al 2016 in others agricultural management practices are changed to reduce the input of nitrate e g bailey et al 2015 hansen et al 2011 wassenaar et al 2006 due to the costs involved with such nitrate reduction measures it is important to assess their effectiveness such assessments entail not only an estimation of the nitrate reduction potential but also an estimation of the time lag between implementation of the measures and the decrease of nitrate concentrations in the pumping wells this time lag is determined mainly by the travel time of water from the point s of recharge to the pumping well böhlke 2002 böhlke and denver 1995 under ideal conditions this time lag can be determined by comparing observed nitrate concentrations in wells and historical inputs of nitrate into groundwater however measured nitrate time series in wells are often too short the nitrate input history is not known well enough or other processes affect the nitrate concentrations such as denitrification see e g alikhani et al 2016 or dilution with water that is low in nitrate e g baillieux et al 2014 thus in most cases travel times of groundwater as well as these additional processes affecting nitrate are determined by means of hydrogeological modeling 2d or 3d and particle tracking environmental tracers or a combination of both alikhani et al 2016 green et al 2008 jeffrey starn et al 2014 kaown et al 2009 macdonald et al 2003 mcmahon et al 2006 osenbrück et al 2006 visser et al 2009 wang et al 2012 zoellmann et al 2001 environmental tracers are a complementary tool to hydrogeological models and time series of nitrate or other tracers for determining travel time distributions or age distributions of groundwater and dilution turnadge and smerdon 2014 visser et al 2009 measurements of δ18o sf6 3h 85kr cfcs 39ar 14c or 4he are commonly interpreted with lumped parameter models lpm to obtain travel time distributions the concentrations of the tracers in a well are calculated as the convolution integral of the input history of the tracers and a relatively simple shape of the age distribution zuber and maloszewski 2001 these shapes can be described by one to just a few parameters fitted to best reproduce measured concentrations of the environmental tracers and their pre selection is often based on the hydrogeological characteristics of the studied area cook and böhlke 2000 knowing the age distribution and the nitrate input history can help reconstruct nitrate concentrations in a given well in the past and predict how they will evolve in the future alternatively the nitrate input history can be reconstructed from measured nitrate time series in combination with the age distribution visser et al 2007 two current difficulties for such assessments are that i there is a lack of environmental tracers that can reliably determine travel times of water in the unsaturated zone and ii very few studies to date have included a rigorous assessment of the uncertainties associated with the determined age distributions and predictions of nitrate concentrations alikhani et al 2016 in the unsaturated zone usz nitrate is transported in the water phase while most environmental tracers are predominately transported in the gas phase with the exception of 2h 3h and 18o which are part of the water molecule itself because the two modes of transport have different velocities travel times for nitrate and environmental tracers from the surface to the well are different especially if the usz is thick because diffusive transport of gaseous tracers in the usz is typically faster than the advective transport in the water phase the usz is often neglected for gaseous tracers zoellmann et al 2001 i e the travel time estimated with these tracers is assumed to represent the travel time in the saturated zone sz only however for aquifers with a thick usz the travel time of water and thus nitrate in the usz can be a significant portion of the total travel time to the well sousa et al 2013 wang et al 2012 and several studies have pointed out that it is problematic to ignore thick uszs 10 m johnston et al 1998 schwientek et al 2009 zoellmann et al 2001 to our knowledge a study by osenbrück et al 2006 is the only study that has considered the time lag of gaseous tracers in the usz for cfcs in conjunction with predicting the evolution of nitrate concentrations but they provided only a limited assessment of the uncertainty of their results several sources of uncertainty need to be assessed when determining age distributions and predicting nitrate concentrations these include but are not limited to i uncertainty in defining a suitable conceptual model of the system bredehoeft 2005 ii uncertainty of the tracer measurements and iii uncertainty in additional aquifer parameters that are needed to calibrate models or estimate the time lag in the usz for example while uncertainties of tracer measurements are often reported the resulting uncertainties in estimated parameters age distributions mean ages and predicted nitrate concentrations are rarely calculated rigorously approaches to deal with uncertainty typically include sensitivity calculations and calculations of how quickly the goodness of fit decreases for a change in a parameter value e g corcho alvarado et al 2007 onnis 2008 schwientek et al 2009 and comparing results for different lpms or different tracers with each other corcho alvarado et al 2007 e g johnston et al 1998 osenbrück et al 2006 green et al 2014 assessed the bias due to model selection and found that while the obtained age distributions can be very different for different models they tend to produce similar mean ages and even more similar predictions of solute concentrations implying that uncertainty associated with model selection is of minor importance for the prediction of the evolution of nitrate concentrations a new bayesian modeling approach to estimate age distributions and their uncertainties resulting from measurement errors and additional model parameters in a more rigorous way was introduced by massoudieh et al 2012 and applied and extended in two follow up studies of relatively simple systems alikhani et al 2016 massoudieh et al 2014 in this study we measured multiple environmental tracers and nitrate to estimate age distributions and predict nitrate concentrations with the bayesian statistical framework of alikhani et al 2016 in an aquifer with a thick unsaturated zone multiple pumping wells and piezometers in the dünnerngäu solothurn switzerland were sampled to determine how quickly already implemented nitrate reduction measures will result in a trend reversal of nitrate concentrations multiple tracers were used to characterize the groundwater age distribution on a time scale of a few years to decades 3h tritiogenic 3he poreda et al 1988 schlosser et al 1988 radiogenic 4he e g torgersen and stute 2013 85kr althaus et al 2009 loosli et al 2000 smethie et al 1992 and 39ar loosli 1983 loosli et al 2000 the bayesian statistical framework of alikhani et al 2016 allows us to estimate confidence intervals for the age distributions and predicted nitrate concentrations due to the thick usz of the study area a special focus is given to the role of the usz which is explicitly included in the lpm measurements in the usz were performed to corroborate our model of the usz results are discussed with respect to the effect that explicitly including the usz in the lpm has on the estimated age distributions and modeled nitrate concentrations furthermore we assess the relative importance of tracer measurements and nitrate time series to obtain reliable and accurate estimates finally the combination of several environmental tracers including 3h with the nitrate time series enables us to estimate the travel times in the unsaturated and saturated zones separately 2 study area the dünnerngäu aquifer located in the canton of solothurn switzerland is an important source of drinking water in an intensely farmed region of the central lowlands of switzerland affected by high nitrate concentrations the main crops are grains corn potatoes vegetables and hay extensive application of mineral fertilizer and manure led to increasing nitrate concentrations in leachate and ultimately in groundwater in the 80s and 90s nitrate concentrations today are generally above the environmental quality target of 25 mg l set by the swiss legislation and even close to the swiss tolerance value for drinking water of 40 mg l at some of the wells fig 1 in 1999 the canton of solothurn initiated a program of nitrate reduction measures in order to meet the water quality targets for drinking water primarily by adapted cultivation techniques and secondarily by transforming cropland to extensive meadows the area of cropland farmed with adapted cultivation techniques increased steadily until 2010 to approximately 890 ha and by then 120 ha of cropland had been converted to extensive meadows see fig a1 in the electronic appendix hunkeler et al 2015 together this constitutes 89 of the agricultural area in the project perimeter and 26 of the total area of the aquifer 41 km2 based on a 2 d particle tracking model implemented at the start of the nitrate reduction measures in 2000 nitrate concentrations were expected to decrease within a few years of the changes in cultivation geotechnisches institut tk consult 1999 while there was a small initial decrease in nitrate concentrations in the pumping wells concentrations remained constant or increased again after 2005 fig 1 this unexpected behavior could either be due to ineffective nitrate reduction measures or due to an underestimation of the travel times possibly because the particle tracking model disregarded the thick unsaturated zone the nitrate input into the groundwater fig 1 was estimated based on mineral fertilizer application rates in switzerland cornaz et al 2005 which were scaled to a maximum nitrate concentration of 60 mg l corresponding to 64 kg of nitrate n ha yr depending on the recharge rate assumed for conversion similar to maximum concentrations that were previously observed in a similar study area in switzerland baillieux et al 2014 for the time before 1975 no data were available and an exponential increase from 10 mg l 11 kg n ha yr in 1910 to 37 mg l 39 kg n ha yr in 1975 was assumed the average nitrate concentrations of recharge in agricultural parcels where land use changes had already been implemented for several years were quantified based on nitrogen balances and measurements of vadose zone nitrate concentrations an average nitrate concentration of 35 mg l 37 kg n ha yr was obtained after the start of the nitrate reduction program in 2000 nitrate input concentrations were thus assumed to decrease proportionally to the increase of the area with adapted cultivation techniques reaching a concentration of 35 mg l in 2010 when most of the farmers were participating in the program see fig a1 in the electronic appendix nitrate concentrations are expected to decrease to 30 mg l 32 kg n ha yr by 2020 due to the conversion of cropland to grassland the hills and mountains surrounding the dünnerngäu are mostly covered by forests and grasslands and nitrate loads are thus considerably lower there geologically the dünnerngäu aquifer is bounded by the jura mountains limestone in the north and the gäu hills molasse in the south fig 2 it consists mostly of unconsolidated gravel deposited after the glacial retreat at the end of the würm glacial in the eastern part the aquifer is in direct contact with limestone from the late jurassic pasquier 1986 in the western part the aquifer and the limestone are separated by marly molasses from the oligocene and miocene chattien aquitanien and clayey silt pasquier 1986 in large parts of the aquifer the gravel is overlain by 1 3 m of clayey silt but the gravel may contain significant proportions of finer material in other areas as well hunkeler et al 2015 the general groundwater flow direction is from oensingen in the southwest towards olten in the northeast along the main axis of the system fig 2 the saturated zone sz is typically between 30 and 55 m thick along the main axis and thins out towards the jura mountains and the gäu hills hunkeler et al 2015 the unsaturated zone usz in turn decreases in thickness from the upstream part of the aquifer towards the downstream part see fig 2 water balance modeling showed that direct diffuse recharge by precipitation infiltration from streams and lateral inflows from the jura mountains and gäu hills each contribute roughly a third to the total groundwater recharge of around 1000 mm yr geotechnisches institut tk consult 1999 hunkeler et al 2015 pasquier 2000 the lower nitrate concentrations in infiltrating stream water and lateral inflows dilute the high nitrate concentrations in the direct recharge the lateral inflows of mountain block recharge mbr from the jura mountains might exhibit a wide range of travel times from fast episodic shallow subsurface flows to slow flows along much longer and deeper flow paths with long travel times pasquier 1986 3 methods 3 1 sampling and analytical methods samples were collected over the course of two years from september 2011 to october 2013 compared to the long term average groundwater levels were low in 2011 and rose to average levels in 2013 in the pumping wells water was pumped from near the top of the water column with the installed pumps in the piezometers water was extracted with submersible pumps mp1 the wells were flushed several times before sampling and field parameters ph temperature electrical conductivity and oxygen saturation were monitored with multi parameter portable meters hach hq30d in total 6 pumping wells and 50 shallow piezometers were sampled most of them multiple times however this paper focuses on the six pumping wells characterized in table 1 water samples for major ion measurements including no3 were filtered in the field and the cation samples acidified with concentrated nitric acid 10 hno3 to stabilize them subsequently samples were measured by ion chromatography dionex dx 120 at the university of neuchâtel for the analysis of hco3 the samples were titrated with 0 1 n hcl the analytical uncertainty of the chemical analyses is 5 and the error in the charge balance was 5 for all samples the δ15n and δ18o stable isotopes of no3 were analyzed by isotope ratio mass spectrometry irms at the university of waterloo canada for 85kr and 39ar measurements 500 2500 l of water were degassed in the field from the extracted gas kr and ar were isolated by preparative gas chromatography lu et al 2014 purtschert et al 2013 riedmann and purtschert 2016 yokochi 2016 the isotopic abundances of 85kr and 39ar were then determined by low level gas proportional counting at the university of bern loosli 1983 loosli et al 1986 loosli and purtschert 2005 results for 85kr are reported in the unit of dpm cckr which stands for the number of 85kr decays per minute per ml stp of kr gas activities of 39ar are given in modern ar relative to the atmospheric activity concentration of 1 78 mbq lar loosli et al 2000 typical relative measurement uncertainties are 5 10 for 39ar and 5 for 85kr samples for dissolved noble gas analyses 3he 4he 20ne were collected in copper tubes aeschbach hertig and solomon 2012 beyerle et al 2000 and analyzed by mass spectrometry at the university of bremen in germany sültenfuβ et al 2009 the analytical error is typically better than 1 for the noble gas concentrations and better than 0 5 for the he isotopic ratio tritium was electrolytically enriched and measured by liquid scintillation counting lsc at the hydroisotop gmbh germany on 1l of water with an uncertainty of typically 1 tu tritium unit to characterize the water content and nitrate concentrations in the usz six vertical soil cores of up to 10 m depth were taken and analyzed the cores were collected by rotary drilling in double core barrels without using water to avoid modification of the pore water composition the cores were extruded from the inner core barrel with a piston with minimal disturbance samples of 100 g were immediately placed in air tight centrifuge containers then a known amount of water was added to the filled containers for nitrate extraction the containers were placed on a shaker for 24 h before they were centrifuged to separate the solid and the liquid phases the liquid phase was filtered and analyzed for no3 by ion chromatography these measurements were then corrected for the dilution by the water added for the extraction the wet weight of the soil was compared to the weight of the dried solid phase to determine the gravimetric water content of the soil two additional multi level boreholes were drilled in the usz near soil core locations to extract soil gas for 85kr analyses see fig 2 these were installed using the direct push technique of the sealed multiport sampling system smps ducommun et al 2013 thereby the individual levels are isolated from each other by an injected mixture of cement and bentonite gas tightness to the atmosphere and between the screen levels was verified by measuring co2 and ch4 concentrations of the extracted air the latter was injected at one level and monitored in the adjacent levels 3 2 estimation of travel times in lumped parameter models lpm the observed concentration ci t is related to the input concentration ci 0 t of tracer i by means of a simplified analytical function ρi t that represents the travel time distribution of the groundwater e g zuber and maloszewski 2001 1 c i t 0 c i 0 t t ρ i t e λ i t dt where the last term represents a first order reaction such as radioactive decay for a stable tracer the decay constant λi is set to zero travel time distributions are characterized by one or several parameters such as the mean travel time or a measure of dispersive mixing when solving the inverse problem of estimating these parameters and others given measured tracer concentrations in groundwater and the tracer input history it is desirable to propagate uncertainties from for example the concentration measurements to obtain uncertainties for the estimated parameters and travel time distributions 3 2 1 tracer input functions input concentrations ci 0 t for 85kr are based on measurements from the bfs bundesamt für strahlenschutz station in freiburg i br winger et al 2005 for 39ar a constant atmospheric concentration was assumed loosli 1983 the 3h input is based on data from the closest monitoring station of the global network for isotopes in precipitation gnip constance iaea wmo 2014 local emissions of 3h from the watch making industry in the studied area althaus et al 2009 were considered with a constant offset from the constance values the best match between measurements and model was obtained for an offset of 7 tu for pre bomb waters before 1953 a constant 3h concentration of 5 tu was assumed roether 1967 nitrate can be included in the model as an additional tracer sensitive to the travel time of water in the usz if denitrification is negligible or can otherwise be quantified providing an additional constraint alikhani et al 2016 the nitrate rich water from intensely farmed areas is diluted with water low in nitrate typically 10 mg l in the study area originating from streams or recharge from the surrounding hillslopes to account for this the nitrate input function see fig 1 is scaled by a dilution factor d a side effect of that dilution factor is also that an error in the assumed maximum of the nitrate input history will mainly affect the dilution factor but not other parameters as long as the shape of the input history is approximately correct for the old component see below a constant nitrate input of 10 mg l is assumed 3 2 2 travel time distributions conceptually the study area is divided into three compartments as illustrated in fig 3 the saturated zone sz the unsaturated zone usz and a compartment contributing old groundwater from below simple and commonly used lpms such as the exponential model em represent the saturated zone compartment only while the model used here does explicitly include the other two compartments lpms require a high degree of simplification and idealization for each compartment all three compartments as well as recharge to the unsaturated and saturated zone are assumed to be homogeneous the thickness of the saturated zone is assumed to be constant in contrast the usz is represented by a wedge shape with linearly decreasing thickness from 30 m to 0 m along the main axis of the aquifer as a simple approximation of the decreasing thickness of the usz along the groundwater flow direction in the study area see fig 2 the model only considers the vertical dimension depth z and one horizontal dimension distance x along main axis of the aquifer see fig 2 the upstream boundary is a no flow boundary there is a groundwater divide south west of well 1 this simplified conceptual model does not distinguish explicitly between recharge from streams through agricultural fields or adjacent hill slopes as this would result in an overly complex lpm relative to the available data the following paragraphs explain in detail how the three compartments were included in the mathematical model of the residence time distributions the saturated zone in isolation meets the conditions of the exponential model first proposed by vogel 1967 resulting in an exponential age distribution for wells screened over the whole aquifer thickness for partially screened wells as is the case in this study the youngest and or the oldest water components are not extracted partial exponential model pem jurgens et al 2012 the cut off age s are a function of the known depth of the screened interval see table 1 for well screens for the em and the pem the travel time of groundwater entering the well at depth z below the water table is given by cook and böhlke 2000 as 2 t gw z t 0 ln z z z where t0 is the mean residence time and z is the thickness of the saturated zone furthermore we relate the depth z below the water table to the horizontal position x where the flow path originated see fig 3 by cook and böhlke 2000 3 x x j z j z z j where zj is the total saturated thickness and xj is the distance of well j from the upstream boundary of the aquifer this allows us to express the travel time along individual flow paths in the idealized saturated zone as a function of x which will be useful for integrating the unsaturated zone moreover eq 3 also defines the contributing area along distance x of each well given its screen depth there are partial overlaps between the contributing areas of several wells however the overlaps are smaller in reality than in the model geotechnisches institut tk consult 1999 because the wells are offset perpendicular to the main axis of the aquifer to various degrees there is no comprehensive yet simple way of considering the usz in the travel time distributions of lpms the usz can either be incorporated through apparent travel time distributions which differ for different tracers depending on their mode of transport in the usz or alternatively the travel time can be defined as the time the water spends in the sz only correcting the tracer input functions to the water table cook and solomon 1995 presented the governing differential equations for transport in both phases in the usz and derived an analytical solution for exponentially increasing atmospheric concentrations of gaseous tracers under specific conditions however for the general case no analytical solution of these equations is available consequently simplified approximations have to be used e g osenbrück et al 2006 or the equations have to be solved numerically e g corcho alvarado et al 2009 2007 rueedi et al 2005 all these studies with lpms assumed a uniform thickness of the usz for the entire study area corcho alvarado et al 2007 rueedi et al 2005 or for each well individually osenbrück et al 2006 so far only schwientek et al 2009 have considered a spatially variable thickness of the usz of single wells apart from 2d or 3d hydrogeological models where this is more common onnis 2008 zoellmann et al 2001 here we present a new approach that allows for an usz with variable thickness to be included in an extended lpm model for parameter estimation typically eq 1 is integrated numerically in contrast to this and similar to schwientek et al s 2009 moving particle approach we numerically integrate a large number of flow paths over the screen depth the total travel time for tracer i along a single flow line intersecting the well at depth z ttot i z is given by the sum of the tracer specific travel time or apparent time lag for gaseous tracers further discussed below in the unsaturated zone tusz i z and the travel time tgw z in the saturated zone see eq 2 the tracer specific travel time distributions can be obtained by aggregating all flow paths intersecting the contributing depth interval well screen plus a margin of 4 m above and below for production wells in addition to the flow paths through the usz and sz slow mountain block recharge is included in the model as an admixed old component with proportion m and a piston flow age told fig 3 overall the concentration ci t of tracer i at time t at the well can thus be calculated by 4 c i t mc i 0 t old 1 m f 1 n 1 n c i 0 t gw z t usz i z e λ i t gw z t usz i z where n is the total number of flow paths f intersecting the contributing depth interval z z f is the equidistantly spaced depth at which flow path f intersects the well and λi is the radioactive decay constant of tracer i λi 0 for a stable tracer one important factor affecting the travel time in the usz tusz i z is the spatially variable thickness of the usz h x using eq 3 h x can easily be written as h x z the wedge shape of the usz results in a wider age distribution of the water in the wells than would be obtained for a usz of constant thickness especially for wells with a long screen for tracers transported in the aqueous phase of the usz a dispersion model dm with mean travel time tusz w h x z h x z vusz w and dispersion parameter δ is used with vusz w the mean seepage velocity same for all flow paths transport of gases in the usz is modeled with a simplified analytical solution of the governing equations described in cook and solomon 1995 they derived an analytical solution for stable gaseous tracers with exponentially increasing atmospheric concentrations in the usz this solution can be adapted for tracers with a first order decay and constant atmospheric concentrations to give the apparent time lag tusz g i of tracer i at the water table relative to the surface 5 t usz g i h x 1 λ i ln cosh h x λ i d i eff θ g with d i eff d i 0 θ g τ g where h x is the thickness of the unsaturated zone d i 0 the diffusion coefficient in air of tracer i d i eff the effective diffusion coefficient θ g the gas filled porosity and 0 τg 1 the tortuosity coefficient of the gas filled pore space because the diffusion coefficient is different for every tracer the apparent time lag is also tracer specific fortunately the diffusion coefficients are well known and do not introduce additional parameters that need to be estimated the assumption of a constant atmospheric concentration is correct for 39ar and approximately valid for 85kr during the last 10 20 years winger et al 2005 for tritiogenic 3he and the radiogenic 4he eq 5 is not applicable because they accumulate in the subsurface because of the large diffusion coefficient of he 3he and 4he are assumed to be in equilibrium with the atmosphere throughout the usz solomon and cook 2000 so that tritiogenic 3he and radiogenic 4he are zero at the water table 3 2 3 parameter and uncertainty estimation in total there are nine fit parameters for each pumping well table 2 which are constrained by two to six tracer measurements per well and the nitrate time series all fit parameters are assumed to be log normally distributed and temporally constant that is transient effects on residence times and the functioning of the flow system are not considered the 4he accumulation rate a the dispersion parameter δ and the gas filled porosity in the unsaturated zone θg are chosen as global parameters i e the same for all wells furthermore the age of the old component told was only considered for wells where 39ar or 4he were measured wells 1 2 and 5 all other parameters are well specific thus in total there are 3 3 5 6 36 parameters which are constrained by 24 tracer measurements and several hundred nitrate measurements without the nitrate data this model is underdetermined without further constraints on the parameter space additional constraints can be obtained from relationships between different parameters of the model or from a priori knowledge of the hydrogeological situation firstly the seepage rate in the usz rusz and the groundwater recharge rate in the sz rgw can be calculated from the model parameters 6 z θ t 0 1 m r gw r usz v usz w θ w where θ θ w θ g where θ is the total porosity θ w is the water filled porosity in the usz and z the thickness of the sz in a perfect system rusz and rgw would be exactly the same but here they are only assumed to be approximately the same because of considerable uncertainties in some of the parameters in these equations which are not fitted secondly an empirical relationship exists between the tortuosity coefficient τg and the gas filled porosity θ g millington and quirk 1961 7 τ g θ g 7 3 θ 2 which is also assumed to be only approximately true thirdly rgw is constrained to r0 1000 700 mm 1σ based on estimates of the recharge rate from previous studies hunkeler et al 2015 the uncertainty of r0 is assumed to be so large not only because these estimates were quite uncertain but also because the recharge rate might vary for the contributing area of the different pumping wells and because the estimate of 1000 mm would be too high if the old component which does not contribute to rgw in the model is a large fraction of the water originating from the jura mountains 30 overall these relations add a total of 3 6 18 constraining equations the overlap of some contributing areas was not used as an additional constraint on the well specific parameters of the respective wells because it is unclear how a partial overlap should be included simply making all parameters global for wells with only a small overlap in contributing areas clearly does not seem appropriate to fit the parameters and estimate their uncertainty the metropolis hastings algorithm mcmc metropolis et al 1953 was used with the following acceptance probability of a new state x given state x 8 p x x min 1 e ξ x e ξ x where 9 ξ x j i c meas ji c mod ji x 2 σ ji 2 j r gw j x r usz j x 2 σ r 1 2 θ θ w j x θ g j x 2 σ θ 2 r gw j x r 0 2 σ r 2 2 where σji is the standard deviation of the observations the first term represents how well the model tracer concentrations agree with the measured tracer concentrations the second term represents the constraints of eqs 6 and 7 and the estimate of the recharge rate how strict these constraints are followed is determined by the value of σr1 σr and σ θ σ disregards the constraints completely whereas σ 0 enforces them perfectly here the σ were chosen to reflect the uncertainty of a priori parameters which are part of the respective equations to obtain a more balanced weighting of the different tracers especially when combining tracers few measurements and nitrate time series many measurements with relatively low measurement uncertainty the uncertainty of 39ar measurements few measurements with high uncertainty was halved to increase their weight and the weight of nitrate measurements was decreased by a factor of 4 to 10 depending on the length of the time series new proposals for the mcmc algorithm were generated in a similar way to turner and sederberg 2012 an initial burn in period before reaching convergence was discarded six different scenarios were investigated to assess the value of tracers and nitrate time series and the importance of explicitly including the usz for modeling and predicting nitrate concentrations see table 3 for the models without usz the nitrate and tracer input was directly applied at the water table i e tusz i 0 and the parameters only relevant for the usz were neglected τg θ g vusz w and δ depending on the scenario burn in periods of up to a hundred thousand samples were required after which a hundred thousand samples were generated using the mcmc algorithm for the scenarionu we found that the number of fit parameters was too high and the correlation between them too strong to give meaningful results to reduce this problem the mean seepage velocity in the usz was also made a global parameter in this scenario 4 results 4 1 chemistry and stable isotopes signatures of major ion composition and stable isotopes of the water are similar for all pumping wells with the exception of well1 for example measured bicarbonate concentrations vary only slightly from 359 to 377 mg l table 4 only nitrate concentrations exhibit a larger relative variability ranging from 27 1 to 39 2 mg l fig 4 little temporal variation in concentrations of major ions was observed over the period of the three sampling campaigns measured stable isotopes of the water are in the range found in local precipitation schotterer et al 2000 well 1 differs from the others by having lower nitrate and bicarbonate concentrations and a slightly more negative stable isotope signature measurements in the shallow piezometers near well 1 confirm this observation see fig 4 and fig a2 the more negative isotope signature of the water from well 1 is likely related to a higher recharge altitude because the well is located close to a transverse valley intersecting the jura mountain chain and draining water from the jura mountains this water is low in nitrate and bicarbonate thus also explaining the observed differences in the chemical signature nitrate scales approximately linearly with bicarbonate in pumping wells and shallow piezometers indicating a mixing of at least two water types fig a3 in the electronic appendix i water high in nitrate and bicarbonate 40 mg l and 400 mg l respectively and ii water low in nitrate and bicarbonate concentrations approximately 10 mg l and 270 mg l respectively type i derives from diffuse recharge of local precipitation water of type ii is contributed by unpolluted water from the jura mountains recharge from the streams in the study area or water from the transverse valley the measured stable isotope signature of nitrate δ15n and δ18o table 4 agrees best with the isotopic signature of soil n kendall and caldwell 1998 see fig a4 in the electronic appendix however the nitrate could also derive from mineral fertilizer and manure with a larger contribution from manure than from mineral fertilizer the isotopes of the nitrate show no sign of denitrification with the exception of one shallow piezometer this is in accordance with the oxic conditions which prevail throughout the aquifer see table 4 consequentially nitrate is considered to show a conservative behavior in this study six profiles in the usz show large variations of water content and nitrate concentrations between profiles and as a function of depth the profiles generally show a decreasing water content with depth which is related to the progressively coarser material with depth depth averaged water contents range from 10 to 19 wt there is no clear trend in nitrate concentrations with depth which could confirm the effectiveness of the nitrate reduction measures for more details see hunkeler et al 2015 4 2 tracers of travel time measured activities of 85kr in the usz decrease significantly with depth fig 5 and are up to 28 lower than the modern atmospheric value 2011 of approximately 75 dpm cckr concentration profiles of 85kr in the usz were calculated for several values of the gas phase tortuosity coefficient τg assuming a constant porosity with depth a fixed depth of the water table see fig 5 and a no flux boundary at the water table cook and solomon 1995 values of τg from 0 06 to 0 10 agree best with the measured concentrations fig 5 measured concentrations at the wells are shown in fig 6 see also table a1 in the electronic appendix activities of 85kr of 30 dpm cckr and 3h activities of 8 to 14 tu indicate that a large fraction of the water is younger than 30 years well1 also contains a considerable fraction of old water 60 years and thus 85kr and 3h free as indicated by an 39ar activity of 77 3 modern and an elevated 4herad concentration simple piston flow or exponential model ages calculated from 3h 3he are systematically smaller on average by about 4 years than the same model ages calculated from 85kr this time difference is attributed to the effect of the usz and the corresponding delay of 85kr at the water table whereas 3hetrit and 4herad in the usz are strongly diluted by the additional he in the gas phase so that they their accumulation in the usz is negligible 4 3 modeling results 4 3 1 concentrations of travel time tracers the six scenarios differ in their ability to reproduce the measured tracer concentrations generally scenarios only relying on tracer measurements and scenarios including the usz perform better in this respect fig 6 as expected measured tracer concentrations are best reproduced by scenariotu using tracer concentrations only and including the usz modeled tracer concentrations are close to or within the 1σ 67 confidence interval of the measured concentrations and vice versa for all 85kr 4he and 3he measurements with the exception of 85kr in well1 the model is not as successful in reproducing the 3h and 39ar data for 3h this might be due to spatially and temporally varying local emissions which are not considered by the constant offset of 7 tu for scenariotu the estimated model uncertainty of tracer concentrations is generally 2 3 times smaller than the reported measurement uncertainty for all tracers including nitrate as a primary fit objective e g scenariontu reduces the relative weight of the tracer measurements resulting in an increased discrepancy between modeled and measured tracer concentrations when comparing scenariotu with scenariontu this is especially the case for 3h fig 6 tritium is affected most because it is transported in exactly the same way as nitrate in contrast transport of the other tracers depends on additional parameters such as the 4he accumulation rate a which can compensate for changes in the parameters that determine the transport of nitrate however when nitrate alone is the primary fit objective scenarionu this compensation mechanism is not sufficient anymore and discrepancies between measured and modeled concentrations increase for 3h 3he and 85kr fig 6 scenarionu also has 2 5 times larger uncertainties of the modeled tracers indicating that only using nitrate as a fit objective has limited ability to constrain the transport of these tracers not including the unsaturated zone in the model generally results in a poorer reproduction of the measured tracer concentrations especially for 3h in scenarios nt and t compared to ntu and tu fig 6 however if only nitrate is used as a primary fit objective measured tracer concentrations are sometimes better reproduced if the usz is not included in the model scenarion this is attributed to the fact that the mean seepage velocity in scenarionu was used as a global parameter whereas in scenarion it was a local one the uncertainty of modeled tracer concentrations is relatively independent of whether the model includes an usz or not 4 3 2 range and sensitivity of fit parameters uncertainties of estimated fit parameters are smaller than the range of the prior indicating the usefulness of the data for parameter estimation the range of obtained values for each fit parameter and for the recharge rate are given in table 5 the complete results for each scenario and pumping well are given in the supplementary material table a2 uncertainties are similar for scenarios ntu nt tu and t and larger for the nitrate only scenarios nu and n indicating that nitrate measurements alone are not able to constrain the parameters as much as the tracer data estimated values of a fit parameter for an individual pumping well are often similar for all six scenarios for example wells 2 and 5 consistently have the longest mean groundwater residence time t0 scenarios without the usz generally result in mean groundwater residence times t0 that are 2 5 years longer in compensation for not considering the delay of the usz 4 3 3 age distributions all pumping wells contain a significant fraction of water that is only a few years old and much of the water of the young component is less than 10 to 15 years old fig 7 exceptions are wells 2 and 5 which are not containing any water younger than 2 and 5 years respectively this is in agreement with the fact that in these two wells the distance between the water table and the top of the screen is largest 20 m whereas in wells 9 and 10 for example it is only 5 m the cumulative age distributions for the investigated pumping wells vary between the scenarios as fig 7 shows only scenarios nt and t have almost identical age distributions and related uncertainties for all wells except well10 uncertainties of the cumulative age distributions are smallest for scenario nt followed by scenariontu and largest for scenarios nu and n part of this increased uncertainty when only using nitrate as a fit objective comes from a higher uncertainty in the fraction of the old water component m the estimated fraction m also is considerably larger when only fitting nitrate 47 75 for well 1 and typically 10 23 for the other pumping wells compared to 26 38 and typically 10 respectively for scenarios including tracers the problem is that in scenarios nu and n m and d are highly correlated because contrary to the other four scenarios m is not constrained by additional tracer measurements total mean travel times ttot usz and sz combined across all pumping wells and scenarios range from 0 6 to 25 4 years table 6 for individual wells values obtained for different scenarios show less spread but still vary by 5 16 years see table a3 in the electronic appendix inter scenario variability is thus considerably larger than the uncertainty estimated for ttot e g 2 4 years for scenariontu table 6 travel times for wells 2 and 5 tend to be larger when including the tracer data and smaller when including the nitrate data fig 7 this pattern applies not only to total travel times but also to travel times in the unsaturated zone for models where it is included disregarding the old component 30 58 of the total travel time is spent in the unsaturated zone table 6 including the old component which does not have an unsaturated zone in the model reduces the mean travel time in the unsaturated zone to 1 25 of the total mean travel time with a few exceptions in wells 2 and 5 the relative proportions of travel time in the usz for a specific pumping well tusz ttot are similar for all scenarios table 6 the apparent time lag of 85kr in the unsaturated zone varies from 25 to 100 of tusz the travel time of water through the usz is thus larger than the time lag for gases 4 3 4 nitrate modeled nitrate concentrations for all scenarios agree similarly well with observed time series for all pumping wells except well 2 and 5 fig 8 in well 2 the observed time series has two distinct concentration peaks and modeled concentrations for the nitrate only scenarios nu and n are aligned with the first peak whereas modeled concentrations for the tracer only scenario tu are aligned with the second peak modeled concentrations for the scenarios including both nitrate and tracers have the peak concentration in the middle between these observed peaks well 5 which has a single peak shows a similar shift to a later peak concentration for tracer based scenarios the degree to which the model can explain the measured data r2 values depends strongly on the individual wells and ranges from a few to over 80 the strikingly low correlation coefficient in wells 2 and 10 for scenario nu compared to other scenarios is caused by making vusz w a global variable in that scenario whereas it is a well specific variable for the other scenarios while median modeled nitrate concentrations are similar for different scenarios differences between the six scenarios are larger concerning the width of the credible intervals of the modeled concentrations and the modeled peak nitrate concentration especially if the observed time series begins when nitrate concentrations are already declining wells6 and 10 in fig 8 credible intervals are generally largest for the tracer only scenarios and smallest for scenarios ntu and nt which use both tracer and nitrate data with the nitrate only scenarios having intermediate credible intervals however for the pumping wells where the peak nitrate concentration is not part of the observed time series nitrate only scenarios have the largest credible intervals especially in well 6 there is also a large difference between the two nitrate only scenarios with scenario nu and n estimating peak nitrate concentration of approximately 32 mg l and 42 mg l relatively most scenarios predict that none of the pumping wells has crossed or will cross in the future the tolerance value for drinking water set by the swiss authorities thanks to decreasing nitrate inputs all scenarios indicate that once the nitrate reductions measures become fully effective nitrate concentrations should fall below the legislative target value of 25 mg l for all wells for wells 6 9 and 10 all scenarios predict similar timing with concentrations falling below the target concentration in approximately 2018 2020 and 2015 respectively for wells 2 and 5 the tracer only scenarios indicate a much slower response to the nitrate reduction measures than the other scenarios in these wells achieving the target value will not happen before 2030 and 2020 respectively but could be delayed until 2050 for well2 no matter how different the age distribution and thus the timing of the decline in nitrate concentrations the concentration that can ultimately be reached once the nitrate measures are fully effective is similar for most scenarios as it only depends on the estimated dilution factor and to a lesser extent on the fraction of old water m an exception is scenario n which predicts a higher final nitrate concentration for well 6 than the other scenarios fig 8 5 discussion in this study we employed environmental tracers and nitrate time series to estimate travel time distributions of groundwater and predict the future evolution of nitrate concentrations modeled nitrate concentrations agree with observed nitrate time series for most pumping wells and scenarios all scenarios that use tracer data can also reasonably well reproduce the tracer measurements fig 6 by combining tracer data and nitrate time series with a lpm that explicitly considers the usz we are able to separate travel times in the sz and usz on one hand the low computational costs of lpms allow for a thorough assessment of uncertainties associated with calculated travel time distributions and nitrate predictions on the other hand the simplifications inherent in the lpm approach can lead to questionable results in a few specific cases the main implication for the dünnerngäu aquifer is that total travel times of water and nitrate are longer than previously thought mainly due to the delay in the usz which has been neglected in the particle tracking model used for the previous estimate geotechnisches institut tk consult 1999 for nitrate including the travel time in the usz doubles the total travel time for most wells table 6 disregarding the old component resulting in a slower reaction to nitrate reduction measures consequentially nitrate concentrations at some of the wells will exceed the target value until 2040 considerable retardation of gaseous tracers in the usz was validated by 85kr measurements in the usz fig 5 none of the scenarios can fully reproduce some of the multi annual fluctuations of the nitrate time series fig 8 indicating that other processes are also modifying nitrate concentrations in the pumping wells these could range from climatic effects on the nitrate input function dry years leading to an enrichment of nitrate in the soil column to shifting groundwater flow paths and mixing under changing hydrological conditions an assessment of such processes would require a more detailed and transient hydrogeological model 3d or at least 2d usz 5 1 reliability and suitability of the model lumped parameter models are very simplified representations of flow dynamics and processes in real aquifers therefore some aspects that might be important cannot be included which may lead to biased results for example the limitation to two dimensions means that lateral inflows of groundwater cannot be considered appropriately which might partially explain the discrepancy between rusz and rgw see table 5 these lateral inflows could also have infiltrated through an usz with different characteristics than local direct infiltration furthermore the model assumes that parameters such as porosity and recharge rates are homogeneous for the contributing area of each well this results e g in the dispersion parameter not representing actual hydrodynamic dispersion but rather locally varying recharge rates porosity or deviations of usz thickness from the idealized model in fig 3 despite this note of caution in the following model estimates of field observables such as porosity are compared to alternative sources of information in the saturated zone rgw not including the old component varies spatially ranging from 680 to 4570 mm yr for well1 average of all six scenarios 2810 mm yr scenario ntu 2760 mm yr to 310 680 mm yr for well 2 average 460 mm yr scenario ntu 480 mm yr table 5 well 1 is located close to the upstream boundary of the aquifer where the assumption of a constant thickness of the aquifer is likely not met additionally the chemistry and stable isotopic signature suggest that a sizeable proportion of the water in well 1 derives from the mountains for well1 the model might thus not be completely suitable averaged over all other wells and all six scenarios rgw is 860 mm yr the highest and lowest recharge rates for a well often result from one of the nitrate only scenarios nu and n whereas scenario ntu consistently results in recharge rates that are in the midrange of all scenarios this indicates that the results of scenario ntu are more robust than those of scenarios relying on nitrate alone differences in recharge rates between wells might indicate different proportions of local recharge from precipitation versus lateral groundwater inflows from the hills and recharge from streams however values of some wells might also be biased due to simplifications of the lumped parameter model such as assuming that the thickness of the saturated zone at the well is representative of the thickness of the saturated zone over the whole contributing area seepage rates in the unsaturated zone as darcy velocities are generally smaller than rgw with an overall average excluding well1 of 720 mm yr 17 less than rgw taking into account the average dilution factor of 0 53 these estimates suggest that direct local recharge from precipitation is on the order of 380 460 mm yr a direct comparison with the recharge rates estimated in previous studies total recharge 1000 mm yr local recharge from direct precipitation 330 mm yr is difficult because of the different spatial scales and because these studies distinguish local direct recharge from precipitation infiltration from streams and lateral inflows from the mountains and hills surrounding the aquifer hunkeler et al 2015 paratte 2013 pasquier 2000 tk consult 2001 whereas the current model only distinguishes between an old and a young component nonetheless our results are of a similar magnitude as in these reports in the usz tortuosity coefficients and the partition of the porosity into water and gas phase also have a relative direct physical meaning fitted tortuosity coefficients for wells 2 10 and scenarios ntu and tu range from 0 08 to 0 18 with a typical uncertainty of 0 03 and an unweighted mean of 0 13 table 5 these values are close to the coefficients derived independently from the 85kr profiles fig 5 of approximately 0 06 0 10 scenario nu nitrate only results in considerably higher values and a large uncertainty well 1 has high tortuosity coefficients 0 22 0 46 for all three scenarios which together with the highest vusz of all pumping wells indicates that the thickness of the unsaturated zone in the contributing area of well 1 is smaller than the wedge shape suggests this is in agreement with the location of the well at the upstream boundary of the system where groundwater from the klus of balsthal which has a thinner usz still constitutes a significant part of the whole water mass see fig 2 the measured soil water content of the two profiles in the usz section 4 1 provides an estimate of θ w 20 30 and together with eq 7 and the tortuosity values from the 85kr profiles in the usz also of θ g 15 20 resulting in a total porosity of 35 50 the modeled θ g of 13 19 are in a similar range the modeled θ w in turn are smaller ranging from 11 to 17 only most likely because the total porosity θ was fixed in the model to 30 6 in the usz which is lower than the total porosity indicated by the profile data 35 50 we did not adjust the porosity in the model for several reasons firstly the profiles were taken from the top 8 10 m of the usz and porosity generally decreases with increasing depth resulting in a lower average porosity for the usz as a whole secondly the two profiles are only two points in space which do not necessarily represent the larger spatial average represented by the tracer based model results because soils with a high porosity often have a lower hydraulic conductivity e g clays finally any stagnant water for example in local clay lenses would be included in θ w as derived from the usz profiles whereas the fitted θ w represents the smaller effective porosity an important aspect not considered in our model is the effect of different travel times for nitrate rich and nitrate poor young water components comparing results of scenario tu with scenario ntu reveals that the performance of modeled tracer concentrations decreases most strongly for 3h when including nitrate as a primary fit objective this suggests that 3h and nitrate represent a different groundwater mix the dilution factor already implies the presence of at least two young water components one nitrate rich local direct infiltration and one nitrate poor e g lateral inflows or infiltration from streams tracer based estimates refer to the travel time distribution of the whole water sample whereas nitrate time series based estimates are biased towards the nitrate rich water component s an example of this effect can be seen at wells 2 and 5 where a comparison of scenarios nu ntu and tu imply a shorter mean travel time for the nitrate rich component than for the nitrate poor component fig 7 and consequently a different timing of nitrate trend reversal fig 8 further evidence for the presence of a water mass that is young but has a low nitrate concentration is that the dilution parameter is smaller than the fraction of young water 1 m and that m is much larger for the nitrate only scenarios 17 26 for wells 2 and 5 compared to 3 5 for scenarios including tracers an explicit modeling of these two water components would further increase the complexity of the model beyond a reasonable level for an lpm and the available calibration data implementing a 3d hydrogeological model would help to overcome some of the limitations of the lpm approach in these hydrogeologically complex settings green et al 2014 mccallum et al 2015 turnadge and smerdon 2014 visser et al 2009 but would introduce its own limitations again hydrogeological modeling would enable a proper incorporation of lateral inflows spatially varying recharge rates and aquifer properties and would also allow determining mixing between several young water components however hydrogeological models require not only more detailed data about aquifer geometry and properties but also enough suitable data for calibration of unknown parameters especially for the usz and the mixing of different water masses in the sz a calibration based on groundwater heads might not be sufficient and additional tracer data or measurements from the usz might be necessary for robust results schilling et al 2017 visser et al 2009 furthermore eberts et al 2012 showed that if analogous conceptual models are used lpms and hydrogeological models often result in very similar contaminant predictions finally due to the high computational costs involved in hydrogeological models they are not very suitable for an estimate of the uncertainty as thorough as done here for the lpm approach 5 2 the value of an explicit unsaturated zone tracer measurements and nitrate time series an explicit representation of the usz in the model allows for the separation of travel times in the usz and the sz at the cost of higher model complexity and thus higher demand on available measurements separating travel times in the usz and sz in a lpm is useful for examining processes that only take place in one of the zones but also for comparing results with results from other models which modeled usz and sz separately or only modeled one of them in contrast to hydrogeological models where omitting the usz leads to a serious underestimation of the total residence time not explicitly including the usz in an lpm model calibrated on tracer measurements leads to a much smaller bias similar mean travel times are obtained for both models because the missing usz is compensated for by a larger mean residence time t0 in the sz tables a2 and a3 in the electronic appendix although omitting the usz in a tracer calibrated lpm results in a similar total travel time it results in bias in other parameters for example the recharge rate of the sz obtained from t0 will be underestimated if the usz is not included in the model if only nitrate measurements are used for model calibration the parameters determining the travel times in the usz and sz mainly vusz w and t0 are highly correlated consequently one of the fit parameters vusz w had to be changed from well specific to global in scenario nu to obtain meaningful results as this caused unrealistic results for some of the wells the explicit modeling of the usz is not advisable if only nitrate time series are available for calibration combining nitrate time series with measurements of gaseous tracers enables a separation of travel times in the usz and the sz gaseous environmental tracers are excellent tools to determine travel times in the sz but do not provide any information on travel times of water in the usz because transport of gaseous tracers in the usz is different from transport of nitrate or 3h the strong correlation between vusz w and t0 is alleviated while time series of 3h might be similarly useful as time series of nitrate long nitrate time series are much more common combining gaseous tracers and nitrate time series thus creates a powerful tool to separate the travel times in the usz and sz the combination of environmental tracers and nitrate time series also improves parameter estimates and reduces the uncertainty of nitrate predictions for most wells scenarios that include tracer information generally result in physically more realistic parameter sets and reduced uncertainty for example for the recharge rates compared to scenarios which only use the nitrate time series to constrain the model regarding the prediction of the future evolution of nitrate concentrations the benefit of including tracer data is largest for pumping wells where nitrate time series are short and do not include the peak of the nitrate concentration history well 6 and 10 in fig 8 in this case the tracer data reduce uncertainty of the peak nitrate concentration the uncertainty of how nitrate concentrations will evolve and the uncertainty of what nitrate concentration is finally achievable for some wells with longer nitrate time series including tracer data does not result in a significant improvement well 2 and 5 our study also has implications for future assessments of nitrate reduction measures in other aquifers extending the statistical framework of alikhani et al 2016 to include an explicit usz we have shown that also in aquifers with a thick usz environmental tracers can be useful for obtaining better and more robust estimates of travel times and predictions of future nitrate concentrations moreover combining these tracers with a time series of any water borne compound that is not degraded in a specific aquifer such as nitrate in this study allows for a separation of the travel times of usz and sz this could be useful information especially if processes occurring in the usz or sz only are important furthermore nitrate measurements in profiles from the usz or samples from shallow piezometers would show much earlier whether nitrate reduction measures are effective the advantage of the latter is that the water sample originates from a larger area whereas the former will give a more plot specific answer however a few occasional measurements in shallow piezometers or the usz do not enable a reliable determination of the travel time from the surface to the piezometer for the water phase therefore a combination of a few shallow measurements with the approach presented here to provide an estimate of travel times in the usz seems to be a promising avenue finally this study has shown once more that hydrogeological modeling without ground truthing the results with suitable measurements can result in misleading conclusions especially if the data used for model calibration mostly reflects transport in the sz groundwater head data whereas the usz also is a considerable and important part of the system 6 conclusion environmental tracer measurements and nitrate time series were used to estimate travel times of groundwater and predict the future evolution of nitrate concentrations in an aquifer polluted by nitrate special emphasis was given to the thick unsaturated zone that decreases in thickness along the flow direction model parameters were estimated using a bayesian inference scheme that allows for an estimation of the joint error structure of these parameters our results show that the apparent underestimation of travel times in an earlier study based on a 2d hydrogeological model can be attributed to a disregard of the usz in that study by combining tracer data and nitrate time series a separation of the travel times in the unsaturated and saturated zone becomes possible different scenarios of model complexity with or without usz and data availability only nitrate time series only tracer measurements or both were evaluated we find that including tracer measurements reduces uncertainty in nitrate predictions if nitrate time series are not available or short but does not necessarily lead to better predictions if long nitrate time series are available however including tracer data generally results in

elements in water at different concentrations relative to inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy icp aes a total of 390 metal laden water samples collected from leaching columns of mine tailings in south africa were analyzed via pxrf and icp aes the pxrf showed differential effectiveness in elemental quantification for the collected water samples the best relationships between

pb produced an r2 of 0 99 while zn and mn produced an r2 of 1 00 the utilization of multiple pxrf stacked beams produced stronger correlation to icp relative to the use of a single beam in isolation the results of this study demonstrated the pxrf s ability to satisfactorily predict the composition of metal laden water as reported by icp for several elements additionally this study indicated the need for a water mode calibration for the pxrf and demonstrates the potential of pxrf for future study of polluted or contaminated waters keywords pxrf water analysis metals 1 introduction clean water is one of the most common yet essential compounds required for life of countless organisms often water has various elements e g ca mg cl f dissolved in it which pose little concern to organisms so long as concentrations are relatively low when concentrations of dissolved salts become too high the water is often termed brackish or salt water high concentrations of dissolved metals in water can pose a serious public health risk as such substances are commonly non detectable without laboratory analysis in some instances the metals dissolved in water come from natural geologic sources for example berg et al 2001 found as levels in raw groundwater used to supply hanoi treatment plants often surpassed world health organization who limits of 10 µg l 1 the origins of which stem from the red river basin nordstrom 2002 detailed an extensive list of countries with as laden groundwater including bangladesh india argentina chile germany hungary romania usa and many others whereby as is naturally occurring from geologic sources in other cases the metals stem from industrial pollution mining or waste migration into surface or subsurface waters used for drinking for example smelting operations in eastern europe left widespread metal pollution across surface soils paulette et al 2015 weindorf et al 2013 similarly razo et al 2004 found surface water storage ponds in villa de la paz matehuala contained as levels more than five times the mexican drinking water standard more recently in the united states the city of flint michigan pop 100 000 experienced a public health crisis when the city s water supply became contaminated with pb hanna attisha et al 2016 in 2015 the gold king mine spill in colorado usa released hundreds of thousands of gallons of acid mine drainage waste into the animas river a source of irrigation water for the farming communities of farmington new mexico and the navajo nation rodriguez freire et al 2016 some studies have also established linkages between metal content in water and other chemical factors such as ph muhammad et al 2011 and conductivity kar et al 2008 the who 2008 has established numerous chemical limits for various elements in drinking water in order to assure human health and safety for example the who drinking water guidelines for pb zn and cu are 10 µg l 1 3 mg l 1 and 2 mg l 1 respectively in determining water quality the who reviews a number of analytical methods among them flame atomic absorption spectrometry faas atomic absorption spectrophotometry aas electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry eaas and inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy icp ms by comparison only two field methods are noted colorimetry and absorptiometry thus fewer field methods are available and with less analytical precision and accuracy relative to laboratory approaches recently portable x ray fluorescence pxrf spectrometry has rapidly developed as a field portable instrument capable of producing multi elemental data with limited sample preparation the royal society of chemistry 2009 provides a succinct overview of the technology whereby a miniature x ray tube dissipating a few watts is used to excite elements thereby causing them to generate secondary fluorescence x rays with characteristic energies for each element elemental abundance is quantified via silicon drift detector sdd which provides higher resolution with little degradation in spectrum quality e g count rate dependent peak broadening or drift relative to silicon pin detectors royal society of chemistry 2009 matrix interference is caused by inter elemental effects whereby emission line overlap and other background variation must be resolved through signal processing peinado et al 2010 while pxrf is theoretically capable of determining many elements the excitation of low atomic number elements e g k is often problematic given fluorescence attenuation in air helium purge or vacuum attachments can overcome some of these limitations but pxrf determination on low atomic number elements remains problematic weindorf et al 2014 those limitations notwithstanding numerous methods now exist for pxrf evaluation of elements in soil and sediment us epa 2007 soil survey staff 2014 weindorf and chakraborty 2016 a litany of studies have established its use for soil e g mclaren et al 2012a zhu et al 2011 chakraborty et al 2017a and vegetal analysis e g mcgladdery et al 2018 mclaren et al 2012b reidinger et al 2012 however the evaluation of liquids by pxrf is comparatively sparse an early study by eksperiandova et al 2002 evaluated wastewater by pxrf using agar and gelatin as a holding matrix for polluted waters they obtained reasonably low relative standard deviations up to 0 08 for several metals at low concentrations 400 mg l 1 pearson et al 2017 extended the use of pxrf by directly determining water salinity based upon elemental determinations of brine waters in a hooded test stand using piecewise linear regression of pxrf sensed cl they obtained r2 values of 0 77 rmse 0 95 µs cm 1 relative to electrical conductance further unpublished data by pearson et al investigated the utility of pxrf to quantify metals in standard icp calibration solutions results showed the potential for multi elemental determination with accuracy of 10 relative to certified reference values several well known limitations do exist for pxrf one of which specifically relates to moisture causing fluorescence attenuation weindorf et al 2014 further it is well established that pxrf cannot attain the low limits of detection nor precision offered by icp or other laboratory based instrumentation contrariwise pxrf offers speed portability and reasonable accuracy that may far surpass current field techniques such as colorimetry even if pxrf was able to effectively differentiate remarkable from non remarkable samples for certain elemental concentrations in solution it would still remain a formidable advance over current techniques one which could potentially save both time and money given the rapid advancements of pxrf for chemical analysis in numerous matrices its evaluation for direct assessment of polluted water seems timely as such the objective of this study was to statistically establish pxrf s predictive ability for various elements in water at different concentrations relative to icp we hypothesize that pxrf will aptly quantify numerous elements in water at concentrations of 10 10 000 mg l 1 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection a total of 390 water samples

found as confirmed by x ray diffraction in the tailing samples subjected to leaching prior to leaching each tailings sample was ground to 6 mm and placed in a column each column was leached with 750

fig 1 a delta premium dp 6000 pxrf olympus innov x waltham ma usa was calibrated with a standard 316 metal alloy target prior to scanning the samples pxrf instrument performance was validated via the scanning of multiple icp standards the pxrf was stationed in a proprietary test stand fig 2 that shields the user from errant x rays and the sample cups were place on the sample stage and inverted directly over aperture of the pxrf fig 2 the instrument was set to soil mode and configured to scan each sample with three 30 s beams totaling 90 s of scanning per sample weindorf and chakraborty 2016 beams one and two were both operated at 40 kev while beam three was operated at 15 kev following scanning two types of data were downloaded from the instrument elemental data as reported by the

retained by replacing the non detected values with half of its corresponding pxrf limit of detection lod simple linear regression slr was used to correlate between the pxrf elemental data and icp measured elements in water samples using r 2 11 0 r development core team 2014 for individual elements the whole dataset was randomly split into 70 calibration and 30 validation sets further slr modeling was executed for predicting elements in the icp calibration standards using pxrf elemental data to eliminate the artifacts arising from the pxrf device or sample geometry xrf spectra were preprocessed using the unscrambler 10 4x camo software inc woodbridge nj usa software as thus far there is no generally established method for the preprocessing of pxrf spectra we followed the method proposed by o rourke et al 2016 with some modifications the dp 6000 pxrf covers all contaminant metals with optimized three beam kv filter current settings where an individual beam is optimized for a suite of metals for one set of analysis individual fluorescence beams from soil mode were extracted as follows fe beam two zn beam two ca beam three cu beam two mn beam three and k beam three for additional analysis and comparison to previous approaches o rourke et al 2016 the three fluorescence beams of soil mode were stacked to exploit the advantage of longer scanning time single beam fluorescence spectra evaluation was baseline corrected and a second order savitzky golay sg smoothing algorithm with a span length of three points was used to smooth each spectrum by optimizing the signal to noise ratio savitzky and golay 1964 no such pre treatment was applied to the stacked three beam approach the full pxrf spectra were calibrated with the analyte of interest using partial least squares regression plsr since it is the most widely used multivariate method based on spectral variance plsr extracts latent factors and subsequently correlates them with the component of interest in this study plsr models with 30 independent validation were developed via r 2 11 0 to explore the correlation between pxrf spectra and both icp and pxrf elemental data model assessment for

used to predict both pxrf and icp reported elemental concentrations 3 results and discussion 3 1 water elemental composition table 1 represents summary statistics of icp and pxrf measured elements in water samples additionally fig 3 a and b exhibit box and whisker plots showing icp and pxrf elemental data respectively as anticipated results showed substantial variation in elemental concentrations in water samples as measured by both icp and pxrf table 1 fig 3a and b indirectly implying the inherent geochemical diversity of the mine tailings for instance among icp reported elements fe 4684 9 mg kg 1 and cu 6699 0 mg kg 1 exhibited almost five and seven folds wider ranges than k 1096 8 mg kg 1 table 1 for comparison barreiros et al 1997 reported the maximum allowed values for drinking water as follows all in µg l 1 k 12 000 cr 50 mn 50 fe 200 ni 50 as 50 se 10 cd 5 sb 10 hg 1 pb 10 conversely ca content varied from 0 to 137 5 mg kg 1 following a similar trend pxrf reported fe 8550 0 mg kg 1 and cu 10 706 2 mg kg 1 exhibited 8 5 and 10 folds wider ranges than k 1034 0 mg kg 1 for mn ca and zn both pxrf and icp reported relatively close mean elemental concentrations yielding a reasonable agreement nevertheless for fe and cu pxrf reported 1 5 folds higher mean elemental concentration than icp contrariwise pxrf k showed more than fivefold higher mean content 161 4 mg kg 1 than the average icp k 23 6 mg kg 1 notably the inherent chemical complexity of mine tailing water was also reported by several researchers simon et al 1999 moncur et al 2015 in this study icp and pxrf reported mean fe concentration was 499 5 and 794 9 mg kg 1 respectively signifying marked enrichment of iron oxides in analyzed water samples indeed low temperature mine waters are usually supersaturated with goethite along with other fe oxyhyroxides moncur et al 2015 notably substantive concentrations of fe were present in the mine tailings used to produce the leachate tested among them hematite magnetite and magnesioferrite pearson et al 2017 concluded that the difference between icp and pxrf based results was perhaps due to the soil mode calibration of pxrf inherently targeted for a soil matrix and associated matrix density soil particle densities are dependent upon mineralogy with one of the most common being 2 65 g cm 3 that of quartz weil and brady 2017 yet certain minerals feature considerably higher particle densities e g magnetite 5 15 g cm 3 hematite 5 30 g cm 3 pyrite 5 01 g cm 3 another possible reason could be the disproportionate self absorption resulting from excessive elemental enrichment in water samples these results indicated the necessity of developing water matrix specific pxrf calibrations 3 2 regression models given the accuracy of pxrf for predicting mine tailings koch et al 2017 and water electrical conductivity pearson et al 2017 slr models were applied to predict the icp based elemental composition of water samples using pxrf elemental data as inputs models yielded calibration r2 ranging from 0 69 to 0 97 suggesting that icp reported elements in water can be satisfactorily predicted by the corresponding pxrf elemental data table 2 pxrf predicted icp elements vs measured icp elements are shown in fig 4 it was apparent that except for ca the remaining elements showed different degrees of underestimation at higher analyte values possibly due to a lack of samples with higher ends of the property scale the highest calibration r2 was reported for k 0 97 with an rmse of 19 35 mg kg 1 notably as per chang et al 2001 proposed rpd based guidelines all calibration models exhibited accurate results with rpd values 2 table 2 these results were maintained in validation sets except for mn where validation r2 was suboptimal 0 51 indicating an overfitted calibration algorithm the best correlation between icp elemental data and pxrf elemental data in the validation sets were obtained for k and cu r2 0 92 further the best rpiq values for both calibration set 3 54 and validation set 3 48 were produced by ca while predicting the icp calibration standards via pxrf measured elements results indicated almost perfect agreements where six ca fe cu pb zn mn out of seven tested elements produced a perfect r2 of 1 00 and the remaining element k produced an r2 of 0 99 table 3 fig 5 interestingly despite the ability of pxrf to perfectly predict mn in icp calibration standards the poor validation results obtained while predicting icp based mn values may be ascribed to the limitation of the random data splitting scheme table 2 as postulated by koch et al 2017 the inclusion of target variability in the data partitioning procedure might improve the distribution of calibration and validation sets eventually augmenting the robustness and predictability of the regression model the ability of pretreated whole xrf spectra to predict icp and pxrf reported elements was a major focus of this study plots in fig 6 represent the optimum number of latent factors for plsr models which were used for predicting icp and pxrf reported ca values via pretreated whole pxrf spectra notably the factor which produces the lowest leave one out cross validation rmse is generally considered as the optimum while calibrating the icp reported elements using full pretreated xrf spectra plsr produced satisfactory calibration r2 for all elements except for cu 0 61 table 4 among all the tested elements the highest model generalization was achieved for mn r2 0 97 rmse 17 92 mg kg 1 followed by fe r2 0 93 rmse 216 65 mg kg 1 and zn r2 0 92 rmse 11 48 mg kg 1 these three elements also performed satisfactorily while validating with 30 independently drawn test set notably the highest validation rpd was produced by fe 3 18 followed by mn 2 00 nevertheless validations results worsened for ca cu and k producing r2 values of 0 30 our results converged with the findings of o rourke at al 2016 although they targeted soil elements instead of water however o rourke et al 2016 stacked their fluorescence beams to capitalize on the benefits of extended scanning times thus we compared a single beam approach to a multi beam approach and found an increase in model performance with the latter table 5 however users should carefully consider the balance between required analytical accuracy versus optimized sample throughput for example single beam quantification produced reasonable validation model accuracy suitable for the determination of several elements e g fe r2 0 90 mn r2 0 74 zn r2 0 60 though in one third the time per sample of the multi beam approach similar trends were followed in the case of pxrf sensed elements where pretreated xrf spectra produced almost perfect calibration results with r2 values ranging from 0 92 to 0 99 for all the elements except for cu 0 75 while considering the independent validation the plsr model of cu underperformed with an r2 value of 0 33 plots of both icp measured and pxrf measured vs pxrf spectra predicted elements are presented in figs 7 and 8 respectively 3 3 pxrf spectral analysis fig 9 shows some typical sample plots for baseline corrected and smoothed pxrf peaks for several individual elements from the sample curves it was obvious that some samples exhibited a monotonic relationship between the counts and xrf energy while some plots were bimodal besides some plots showed a u shaped pattern or zig zag relationship all these made it difficult to find the fwhm and hmax which is only possible if the peak has a unimodal shape however in our data the relationship between the counts and energy was more complicated and diversified for example only 10 samples for ca were able to generate fwhm values these results further validated the findings of pearson et al 2017 where the generation of fwhm values for k and cl peaks was not possible due to their multimodal and monotonic nature indeed it is also imperative to consider interferences between elements in xrf spectra when explaining the pxrf results gazley and fisher 2014 consequently the conclusion of sacristán et al 2016 that complex data processing and possible matrix effects in pxrf measurements can be offset easily and rapidly by the exploitation of fwhm and hmax warrants further validations summarily our study has confirmed the potential of using pxrf for quick and on site elemental characterization of metal laden water supplementing conventional standard analyses like icp in any case this approach can be used for rapid screening of water quality which demands modest precision substantively better precision that simply colorimetry or other field based tests it can be concluded that the predictability of certain elements can be further enhanced by increasing the variability of analyte concentrations in water samples some researchers may argue that the prediction accuracy can be increased by increasing the pxrf scanning time yet the enhanced pxrf predictability by such increased scanning time has to be taken into account against the speed achieved by using pxrf most importantly this research has underlined the necessity of developing water mode calibration for the pxrf instrument for the better management of xrf spectra in a low density water matrix 4 conclusions this pilot study presented a proof of concept demonstration and proposed a simple and convenient procedure for predicting the elemental composition of metal laden water results indicated that water elemental contents as reported by standard icp based protocol can be satisfactorily predicted by the corresponding pxrf measured elements as expected for many elements icp had the lowest limit of detection but pxrf provided wide dynamic range of quantification e g 10 to 1000 mg kg 1 with no need for dilutions or sample preparation pxrf scanning of individual elements isolated in icp standards produced robust results for each element evaluated r2 of 0 99 to 1 00 while validation icp pxrf statistics for collected water samples showed a strong r2 for k 0 92 cu 0 92 and zn 0 91 besides pretreated whole xrf spectra were able to predict both icp and pxrf reported elements via plsr algorithm however utilization of all three spectral beams produced stronger results than use of a single beam in isolation this research also underlined the necessity of developing water mode calibration for a low density water matrix and better spectral preprocessing methods than the use of extracted fwhm and hmax values nonetheless the obtained results are encouraging and

7276,a rapid method for in situ elemental composition analysis of metal laden water would be indispensable for studying polluted water current analytical lab methods to determine water quality include flame atomic absorption spectrometry faas atomic absorption spectrophotometry aas electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry eaas and inductively coupled plasma icp spectroscopy however only two field methods colorimetry and absorptiometry exist for elemental analysis of water portable x ray fluorescence pxrf spectrometry is an effective method for elemental analysis of soil sediment and other matrices however the accuracy of pxrf is known to be affected while scanning moisture laden soil samples this study sought to statistically establish pxrf s predictive ability for various elements in water at different concentrations relative to inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy icp aes a total of 390 metal laden water samples collected from leaching columns of mine tailings in south africa were analyzed via pxrf and icp aes the pxrf showed differential effectiveness in elemental quantification for the collected water samples the best relationships between icp and pxrf elemental data were obtained for k and cu r2 0 92 however when scanning icp calibration solutions with elements in isolation pxrf results indicated near perfect agreement ca k fe cu and pb produced an r2 of 0 99 while zn and mn produced an r2 of 1 00 the utilization of multiple pxrf stacked beams produced stronger correlation to icp relative to the use of a single beam in isolation the results of this study demonstrated the pxrf s ability to satisfactorily predict the composition of metal laden water as reported by icp for several elements additionally this study indicated the need for a water mode calibration for the pxrf and demonstrates the potential of pxrf for future study of polluted or contaminated waters keywords pxrf water analysis metals 1 introduction clean water is one of the most common yet essential compounds required for life of countless organisms often water has various elements e g ca mg cl f dissolved in it which pose little concern to organisms so long as concentrations are relatively low when concentrations of dissolved salts become too high the water is often termed brackish or salt water high concentrations of dissolved metals in water can pose a serious public health risk as such substances are commonly non detectable without laboratory analysis in some instances the metals dissolved in water come from natural geologic sources for example berg et al 2001 found as levels in raw groundwater used to supply hanoi treatment plants often surpassed world health organization who limits of 10 µg l 1 the origins of which stem from the red river basin nordstrom 2002 detailed an extensive list of countries with as laden groundwater including bangladesh india argentina chile germany hungary romania usa and many others whereby as is naturally occurring from geologic sources in other cases the metals stem from industrial pollution mining or waste migration into surface or subsurface waters used for drinking for example smelting operations in eastern europe left widespread metal pollution across surface soils paulette et al 2015 weindorf et al 2013 similarly razo et al 2004 found surface water storage ponds in villa de la paz matehuala contained as levels more than five times the mexican drinking water standard more recently in the united states the city of flint michigan pop 100 000 experienced a public health crisis when the city s water supply became contaminated with pb hanna attisha et al 2016 in 2015 the gold king mine spill in colorado usa released hundreds of thousands of gallons of acid mine drainage waste into the animas river a source of irrigation water for the farming communities of farmington new mexico and the navajo nation rodriguez freire et al 2016 some studies have also established linkages between metal content in water and other chemical factors such as ph muhammad et al 2011 and conductivity kar et al 2008 the who 2008 has established numerous chemical limits for various elements in drinking water in order to assure human health and safety for example the who drinking water guidelines for pb zn and cu are 10 µg l 1 3 mg l 1 and 2 mg l 1 respectively in determining water quality the who reviews a number of analytical methods among them flame atomic absorption spectrometry faas atomic absorption spectrophotometry aas electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry eaas and inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy icp ms by comparison only two field methods are noted colorimetry and absorptiometry thus fewer field methods are available and with less analytical precision and accuracy relative to laboratory approaches recently portable x ray fluorescence pxrf spectrometry has rapidly developed as a field portable instrument capable of producing multi elemental data with limited sample preparation the royal society of chemistry 2009 provides a succinct overview of the technology whereby a miniature x ray tube dissipating a few watts is used to excite elements thereby causing them to generate secondary fluorescence x rays with characteristic energies for each element elemental abundance is quantified via silicon drift detector sdd which provides higher resolution with little degradation in spectrum quality e g count rate dependent peak broadening or drift relative to silicon pin detectors royal society of chemistry 2009 matrix interference is caused by inter elemental effects whereby emission line overlap and other background variation must be resolved through signal processing peinado et al 2010 while pxrf is theoretically capable of determining many elements the excitation of low atomic number elements e g k is often problematic given fluorescence attenuation in air helium purge or vacuum attachments can overcome some of these limitations but pxrf determination on low atomic number elements remains problematic weindorf et al 2014 those limitations notwithstanding numerous methods now exist for pxrf evaluation of elements in soil and sediment us epa 2007 soil survey staff 2014 weindorf and chakraborty 2016 a litany of studies have established its use for soil e g mclaren et al 2012a zhu et al 2011 chakraborty et al 2017a and vegetal analysis e g mcgladdery et al 2018 mclaren et al 2012b reidinger et al 2012 however the evaluation of liquids by pxrf is comparatively sparse an early study by eksperiandova et al 2002 evaluated wastewater by pxrf using agar and gelatin as a holding matrix for polluted waters they obtained reasonably low relative standard deviations up to 0 08 for several metals at low concentrations 400 mg l 1 pearson et al 2017 extended the use of pxrf by directly determining water salinity based upon elemental determinations of brine waters in a hooded test stand using piecewise linear regression of pxrf sensed cl they obtained r2 values of 0 77 rmse 0 95 µs cm 1 relative to electrical conductance further unpublished data by pearson et al investigated the utility of pxrf to quantify metals in standard icp calibration solutions results showed the potential for multi elemental determination with accuracy of 10 relative to certified reference values several well known limitations do exist for pxrf one of which specifically relates to moisture causing fluorescence attenuation weindorf et al 2014 further it is well established that pxrf cannot attain the low limits of detection nor precision offered by icp or other laboratory based instrumentation contrariwise pxrf offers speed portability and reasonable accuracy that may far surpass current field techniques such as colorimetry even if pxrf was able to effectively differentiate remarkable from non remarkable samples for certain elemental concentrations in solution it would still remain a formidable advance over current techniques one which could potentially save both time and money given the rapid advancements of pxrf for chemical analysis in numerous matrices its evaluation for direct assessment of polluted water seems timely as such the objective of this study was to statistically establish pxrf s predictive ability for various elements in water at different concentrations relative to icp we hypothesize that pxrf will aptly quantify numerous elements in water at concentrations of 10 10 000 mg l 1 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection a total of 390 water samples were collected from leaching columns of mine tailings in south africa leaching of the tailings was generally in accordance with method d5744 13 astm 2013 with deference and respect to maintaining mine operator anonymity the exact mines sampled cannot be disclosed however they were generally an assortment of cu u zn ag and au mines in addition to common soil mineral matrices e g montmorillonite biotite quartz calcite hematite gypsum muscovite substantive concentrations of more exotic minerals e g gahnite sphalerite galena nchwaningite uranopolycrase billietite chlorargyrite cuprospinel were found as confirmed by x ray diffraction in the tailing samples subjected to leaching prior to leaching each tailings sample was ground to 6 mm and placed in a column each column was leached with 750 ml of deionized water then preserved with hno3 and stored in clean sealed bottles at 4 c samples were then transported to texas tech university lubbock tx usa for analysis in the pedology laboratory 2 2 laboratory analysis prior to analysis samples were allowed to return to room temperature 20 c any samples containing suspended particles were filtered with 2 filter paper micro filtration systems dublin ca usa before analysis each sample was placed in a series 1400 plastic sample cup chemplex industries palm city fl usa then covered with prolene thin film chemplex industries palm city fl usa fig 1 a delta premium dp 6000 pxrf olympus innov x waltham ma usa was calibrated with a standard 316 metal alloy target prior to scanning the samples pxrf instrument performance was validated via the scanning of multiple icp standards the pxrf was stationed in a proprietary test stand fig 2 that shields the user from errant x rays and the sample cups were place on the sample stage and inverted directly over aperture of the pxrf fig 2 the instrument was set to soil mode and configured to scan each sample with three 30 s beams totaling 90 s of scanning per sample weindorf and chakraborty 2016 beams one and two were both operated at 40 kev while beam three was operated at 15 kev following scanning two types of data were downloaded from the instrument elemental data as reported by the software as configured and raw fluorescent energies spectra reported as counts and fluorescent energy kev for each scan elemental data is ideal for straightforward applications while raw spectral data allows for advanced analysis all samples underwent inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes analysis with an icap7400 model instrument thermo fisher scientific waltham ma usa high purity argon was used as plasma auxiliary and nebulizer gas the data acquisition integration and wash times were 30 s with 3 time repetition and averaged over the three bettinelli et al 2000 the calibration standards were custom icp standards 1 2 3 4 and 5 scp science montreal qc canada each diluted to six levels l1 through l6 check calibration standards l2 and l4 were inserted after every 50 samples to check consistency 2 3 statistical modeling and spectral treatments to improve the capability to fit models and test their results the elements with 10 missing data non detected were retained by replacing the non detected values with half of its corresponding pxrf limit of detection lod simple linear regression slr was used to correlate between the pxrf elemental data and icp measured elements in water samples using r 2 11 0 r development core team 2014 for individual elements the whole dataset was randomly split into 70 calibration and 30 validation sets further slr modeling was executed for predicting elements in the icp calibration standards using pxrf elemental data to eliminate the artifacts arising from the pxrf device or sample geometry xrf spectra were preprocessed using the unscrambler 10 4x camo software inc woodbridge nj usa software as thus far there is no generally established method for the preprocessing of pxrf spectra we followed the method proposed by o rourke et al 2016 with some modifications the dp 6000 pxrf covers all contaminant metals with optimized three beam kv filter current settings where an individual beam is optimized for a suite of metals for one set of analysis individual fluorescence beams from soil mode were extracted as follows fe beam two zn beam two ca beam three cu beam two mn beam three and k beam three for additional analysis and comparison to previous approaches o rourke et al 2016 the three fluorescence beams of soil mode were stacked to exploit the advantage of longer scanning time single beam fluorescence spectra evaluation was baseline corrected and a second order savitzky golay sg smoothing algorithm with a span length of three points was used to smooth each spectrum by optimizing the signal to noise ratio savitzky and golay 1964 no such pre treatment was applied to the stacked three beam approach the full pxrf spectra were calibrated with the analyte of interest using partial least squares regression plsr since it is the most widely used multivariate method based on spectral variance plsr extracts latent factors and subsequently correlates them with the component of interest in this study plsr models with 30 independent validation were developed via r 2 11 0 to explore the correlation between pxrf spectra and both icp and pxrf elemental data model assessment for both slr and plsr was accomplished using root mean squared error rmse residual prediction deviation rpd the coefficient of determination r2 and the ratio of performance to interquartile range rpiq

as the interquartile range iq rmse of prediction per eq 4 4 iq q 3 q 1 where q3 and q1 are the third and first quartile respectively 2 4 pxrf spectral analysis the extracted baseline corrected and smoothed pxrf spectra for individual element were further preprocessed to extract kα emission lines of fe 6 40 kev zn 8 63 kev ca 3 69 kev cu 8 04 kev mn 5 89 kev and k 3 31 kev for each individual extracted peak full width at half maximum fwhm and the maximum height hmax were extracted per sacristán et al 2016 the peak parameters were extracted using originpro originlab ma usa and subsequently used to predict both pxrf and icp reported elemental concentrations 3 results and discussion 3 1 water elemental composition table 1 represents summary statistics of icp and pxrf measured elements in water samples additionally fig 3 a and b exhibit box and whisker plots showing icp and pxrf elemental data respectively as anticipated results showed substantial variation in elemental concentrations in water samples as measured by both icp and pxrf table 1 fig 3a and b indirectly implying the inherent geochemical diversity of the mine tailings for instance among icp reported elements fe 4684 9 mg kg 1 and cu 6699 0 mg kg 1 exhibited almost five and seven folds wider ranges than k 1096 8 mg kg 1 table 1 for comparison barreiros et al 1997 reported the maximum allowed values for drinking water as follows all in µg l 1 k 12 000 cr 50 mn 50 fe 200 ni 50 as 50 se 10 cd 5 sb 10 hg 1 pb 10 conversely ca content varied from 0 to 137 5 mg kg 1 following a similar trend pxrf reported fe 8550 0 mg kg 1 and cu 10 706 2 mg kg 1 exhibited 8 5 and 10 folds wider ranges than k 1034 0 mg kg 1 for mn ca and zn both pxrf and icp reported relatively close mean elemental concentrations yielding a reasonable agreement nevertheless for fe and cu pxrf reported 1 5 folds higher mean elemental concentration than icp contrariwise pxrf k showed more than fivefold higher mean content 161 4 mg kg 1 than the average icp k 23 6 mg kg 1 notably the inherent chemical complexity of mine tailing water was also reported by several researchers simon et al 1999 moncur et al 2015 in this study icp and pxrf reported mean fe concentration was 499 5 and 794 9 mg kg 1 respectively signifying marked enrichment of iron oxides in analyzed water samples indeed low temperature mine waters are usually supersaturated with goethite along with other fe oxyhyroxides moncur et al 2015 notably substantive concentrations of fe were present in the mine tailings used to produce the leachate tested among them hematite magnetite and magnesioferrite pearson et al 2017 concluded that the difference between icp and pxrf based results was perhaps due to the soil mode calibration of pxrf inherently targeted for a soil matrix and associated matrix density soil particle densities are dependent upon mineralogy with one of the most common being 2 65 g cm 3 that of quartz weil and brady 2017 yet certain minerals feature considerably higher particle densities e g magnetite 5 15 g cm 3 hematite 5 30 g cm 3 pyrite 5 01 g cm 3 another possible reason could be the disproportionate self absorption resulting from excessive elemental enrichment in water samples these results indicated the necessity of developing water matrix specific pxrf calibrations 3 2 regression models given the accuracy of pxrf for predicting mine tailings koch et al 2017 and water electrical conductivity pearson et al 2017 slr models were applied to predict the icp based elemental composition of water samples using pxrf elemental data as inputs models yielded calibration r2 ranging from 0 69 to 0 97 suggesting that icp reported elements in water can be satisfactorily predicted by the corresponding pxrf elemental data table 2 pxrf predicted icp elements vs measured icp elements are shown in fig 4 it was apparent that except for ca the remaining elements showed different degrees of underestimation at higher analyte values possibly due to a lack of samples with higher ends of the property scale the highest calibration r2 was reported for k 0 97 with an rmse of 19 35 mg kg 1 notably as per chang et al 2001 proposed rpd based guidelines all calibration models exhibited accurate results with rpd values 2 table 2 these results were maintained in validation sets except for mn where validation r2 was suboptimal 0 51 indicating an overfitted calibration algorithm the best correlation between icp elemental data and pxrf elemental data in the validation sets were obtained for k and cu r2 0 92 further the best rpiq values for both calibration set 3 54 and validation set 3 48 were produced by ca while predicting the icp calibration standards via pxrf measured elements results indicated almost perfect agreements where six ca fe cu pb zn mn out of seven tested elements produced a perfect r2 of 1 00 and the remaining element k produced an r2 of 0 99 table 3 fig 5 interestingly despite the ability of pxrf to perfectly predict mn in icp calibration standards the poor validation results obtained while predicting icp based mn values may be ascribed to the limitation of the random data splitting scheme table 2 as postulated by koch et al 2017 the inclusion of target variability in the data partitioning procedure might improve the distribution of calibration and validation sets eventually augmenting the robustness and predictability of the regression model the ability of pretreated whole xrf spectra to predict icp and pxrf reported elements was a major focus of this study

65 mg kg 1 and zn r2 0 92 rmse 11 48 mg kg 1 these three elements also performed satisfactorily while validating with 30 independently drawn test set notably the highest validation rpd was produced by fe 3 18 followed by mn 2 00 nevertheless validations results worsened for ca cu and k producing r2 values of 0 30 our results converged with the findings of o rourke at al 2016 although they targeted

7277,stream depletion due to groundwater extraction by wells may cause impact on aquatic ecosystem in streams conflict over water rights and contamination of water from irrigation wells near polluted streams a variety of studies have been devoted to addressing the issue of stream depletion but a fundamental framework for analytical modeling developed from aquifer viewpoint has not yet been found this review shows key differences in existing models regarding the stream depletion problem and provides some guidelines for choosing a proper analytical model in solving the problem of concern we introduce commonly used models composed of flow equations boundary conditions well representations and stream treatments for confined unconfined and leaky aquifers they are briefly evaluated and classified according to six categories of aquifer type flow dimension aquifer domain stream representation stream channel geometry and well type finally we recommend promising analytical approaches that can solve stream depletion problem in reality with aquifer heterogeneity and irregular geometry of stream channel several unsolved stream depletion problems are also recommended keywords stream depletion rate sdr stream aquifer interaction analytical model image well method 1 introduction a considerable amount of stream water may flow toward a nearby well due to pumping in an aquifer which is referred to as stream depletion stream depletion is an important issue that attracts the attention of hydrologists because it may have impacts on aquatic ecosystems e g foglia et al 2013 streambed may become completely dry because of stream depletion e g hunt 2014 contaminants in a polluted stream may enter the adjacent aquifer and arrive at irrigation wells e g chen 2001 moreover groundwater abstraction from a well near two streams may involve conflict over water distribution regulated by water rights e g sun and zhan 2007 the stream depletion rate sdr defined as a dimensionless ratio of the volumetric rate of water abstraction from a stream to a pumping rate is an index to quantify stream depletion the sdr ranges from zero to unity if all interconnected surface water features are considered the sdr may be less than unity if derived from a particular stream or boundary segment reeves et al 2009 developed michigan water withdrawal screening tool based on the analytical solution of hunt 1999 to assess resource impacts due to water withdrawal recently hunt 2014 reviewed analytical solutions of sdr and provided a useful tool for analyzing groundwater resources function xls which can be downloaded from his website a large number of articles have addressed the problem of stream depletion but a general framework illustrating the applicability and limitations in various analytical models from aquifer viewpoint has not been presented this review illustrates key differences in existing models and serves as a guide to select an appropriate analytical model for engineering applications the target audiences are those who apply analytical approaches to solve real world problems of stream depletion at the beginning we provide a mathematical framework composed of flow equations along with associated boundary conditions bcs and source sink terms for pumped confined unconfined and leaky aquifers near a stream then we give some comments on analytical models regarding stream depletion problem finally we recommend some unsolved problems that may be of practical use in the future 2 framework of problem 2 1 flow equations the notations used in the text are

and applicable when h d 0 1 for small movement of water table relative to the initial aquifer thickness huang et al 2016 2 2 2 leakage across aquitard consider a two layered aquifer system with an aquitard in between as shown in panel c of fig 1 the upper aquifer is assumed to be a source with constant hydraulic head ha the flux through the aquitard satisfies e g zhan and park 2003 6 k z h z k b h h a at z d where h is the hydraulic head in the lower aquifer the sign is negative for h z 0 and positive for h z 0 eq 6 can be regarded as a top bc for eq 1 describing 3d flow in the lower aquifer in the absence of vertical flow the source term k h h a tb can be inserted into the rhs of eq 2 to account for the effect of leakage on 2d flow in the lower aquifer e g zlotnik and tartakovsky 2008 huang et al 2014 mentioned that the simplification of eq 1 with 6 to eq 2 with the extra leakage term is applicable to sdr estimation when k z a 2 k h d 2 10 the layer overlying a pumped layer can be treated as a source bed with constant hydraulic head ha before a certain time of pumping period the time can be determined by solving the equation sdr hunt sdr z t 10 2 in which the subscripts hunt and z t represent the sdr solutions given by hunt 2009 and zlotnik and tartakovsky 2008 respectively consider two layered aquifer system 1 with the upper layer connected to a stream and penetrated by a well and aquifer system 2 with a stream connected to both layers and a well in the lower layer as illustrated in fig 2 the former solution based on quasi 3d flow can be used to estimate sdrs for aquifer systems 1 and 2 and the latter is applicable to both aquifer systems where the layers with no pumping are considered as a constant head source bed define dimensionless time as t t 1 t s 1 a 2 and dimensionless parameters as λ k a 2 tb κ k a k h b κ 2 1 t 2 t 1 and σ 2 1 s 2 s 1 fig 2 describes the curve of σ 2 1 versus t prior to which both solutions predict the same sdr for λ 1 κ 10 and κ 2 1 1 for example both solutions agree well when t 0 7 for aquifer system 1 with σ 2 1 10 3 and t 57 for aquifer system 2 with σ 2 1 10 3 the figure provides the smallest of t predictions associated with variations in λ k and k 2 1 in the range of 0 λ 1 0 κ 10 and 0 κ 2 1 1 hunt 2009 note that sdr z t is a closed form solution that microsoft excel can handle while sdr hunt is a laplace domain solution that relies on the crump or stehfest algorithm yeh and chang 2013 for numerical inversion to obtain time domain result from those discussed above we can conclude that sdr z t is applicable to aquifer system 2 when k z a 2 k h d 2 10 and p t with pumping period p t s 1 a 2 t t 1 and t described in fig 2 according to σ 2 1 the lower layer for aquifer system 1 can t be considered as a constant head source bed because σ 2 1 typically equals 0 01 that causes a very small t i e 0 7 hunt 2009 2 3 type of well 2 3 1 vertical well for the case of aquifer drawdown induced by a fully penetrating well fpw the inner bc describing water flux across the rim of the wellbore can be expressed as papadopulos and cooper 1967 7 2 π r w k h d h r q π r c 2 h t at r r w where the second rhs term accounts for the effect of wellbore storage for a partially penetrating well ppw with a screen between elevations z z u and z z l the line sink term q δ x x 0 δ y y 0 u z z l u z z u z u z l is introduced to eq 1 the term reduces to q δ x x 0 δ y y 0 d for a fpw when z l 0 and z u d similarly one can insert a point sink term q δ x x 0 δ y y 0 t in eq 2 or q δ x x 0 δ y y 0 t i in eq 3 for a pumped layer notice that each of the sink terms is inserted into the rhs of the associated flow equation the line or point sink represents a well of infinitesimal radius and neglects the effects of well radius and wellbore storage papadopulos and cooper 1967 revealed that 2d flow models of eq 2 with 7 and eq 2 with the point sink term will predict the same drawdown when t 2 5 10 2 r c 2 t 2 3 2 radial collector well a radial collector well rcw is commonly treated as line sink with uniform distribution of flux on the laterals in analytical models e g huang et al 2016 the solution of the model starts from applying green s function for eq 1 with an extra point sink term q δ x x 0 δ y y 0 δ z z 0 integrating the function to variables x 0 y 0 along horizontal laterals for a fixed z 0 and dividing the result by the total lateral length a horizontal well can be regarded as a special case of a rcw with a single lateral huang et al 2011 similarly a slanted well can be derived by integrating the function to variables x 0 y 0 z 0 along the well tsou et al 2010 2 4 stream representations 2 4 1 dirichlet boundary condition a stream can be treated as the dirichlet bc when directly connected to the adjacent aquifer the hydraulic head remains constant denoted as h h 0 at stream aquifer interface however a low permeability streambed specified as the dirichlet bc provokes 58 71 discrepancies in predicted sdr e g spalding and khaleel 1991 sophocleous et al 1995 instead one should consider a robin bc that can account for the effect of streambed permeability on sdr 2 4 2 robin boundary condition flux across a low permeability streambed can be described by the robin condition denoted as e g hantush 1965 8 h n k k n b h h 0 0 at ω s where the sign is considered to be if h n 0 and if h n 0 unlike the case of the dirichlet condition the hydraulic head at a robin boundary does decline with pumping time eq 8 can be expressed as h x κ h h 0 0 at x 0 with x x a and κ k a k h b for a robin bc at x 0 it reduces to h x 0 no flow condition when κ 0 i e k 0 and approaches h h 0 dirichlet condition if κ 10 concluded from the following example consider the glover and balmer 1954 sdr solution based on the dirichlet condition of h h 0 and hantush 1965 sdr solution that accounts for the effect of streambed permeability by varying the magnitude of κ fig 3 illustrates the curves of sdr versus dimensionless time t i e tt sa 2 predicted by both solutions for κ 0 01 0 1 1 10 and 20 the figure shows that a small value of κ results in a very small sdr at a given time indicating that the sdr is very sensitive to varying κ both solutions agree well when κ 10 and 20 implying that a low permeability streambed with κ 10 can be regarded as the dirichlet bc in estimating sdr the condition i e κ 10 facilitates application of image well method as discussed in section 2 5 2 4 3 plane line source term a fps of small width may be regarded as a plane source denoted as 2 k h h 0 δ x b in eq 1 for 3d flow a line source as 2 k d h h 0 δ x tb in eq 2 for 2d flow or 2 k d i h i h 0 δ x t i b in eq 3 for quasi 3d flow the dirac delta function δ x indicates an infinitesimal width stream at x 0 e g hunt 1999 interestingly a 2d flow model with the line source term or the robin bc eq 8 predicts exactly the same sdr as proven by sun and zhan 2007 2 4 4 strip source term with the dupuit assumption of no vertical flow in aquifers a finite width stream can be treated as a strip source term also called volume source term written as k h h 0 u x u x w tb in eq 2 for 2d flow or k h i h 0 u x u x w t i b in eq 3 for quasi 3d flow e g butler et al 2001 when a w 1 the effect of stream width on sdr is negligible indicating that a finite width stream can be regarded as a rectilinear one butler et al 2001 hunt 2008 2 5 selecting appropriate analytical model flowcharts describing how to select appropriate analytical models of sdr for stream aquifer systems under the confined unconfined and leaky conditions are respectively displayed in figs 4 6 the models cited herein are classified according to the following six categories aquifer type flow dimension aquifer domain stream representation stream channel geometry and well type fig 4 depicts the use of image well method that places image wells at judicious locations to replace the dirichlet boundary the solution of the model describing the head distribution can be superposed as the sum of kernel functions accounting for the individual heads induced by a real well and image wells a closed form solution of the head can be developed if a closed form expression proposed by huang et al 2015 for confined aquifers or by hunt 1977 for leaky aquifers is chosen as the kernel function huang and yeh 2015 proposed an advanced image well method that simulates a meandering stream under the robin bc using the theis 1935 drawdown solution as kernel function for confined aquifers their method may be applied to unconfined aquifers if the drawdown solution of neuman 1972 is used as the kernel function similarly it can also be applied to leaky aquifers if the hantush and jacob 1955 solution is adopted as the kernel function it is worth noting that the analytical approach of huang and yeh 2016 in fig 4 can deal with the problems for aquifers with laterally heterogeneity on the other hand the cited models for the confined unconfined and leaky conditions are respectively classified in tables 2 4 one can easily choose an appropriate model to the scenario or problem of concern 3 brief comments on analytical models compared with numerical models such as modflow the analytical models discussed in figs 4 6 generally require less data for parameter identification especially when available data are sparse hunt 2014 generally speaking the solutions of the analytical models have many advantages for example they are easy to implement in addition they can verify numerical solutions in the development of computer code evaluate the impact of parameter uncertainty on model output and explore physical insights on how aquifer parameters and boundary conditions affect sdr however all the 3d flow models are applicable only to the case of fps tsou et al 2010 sedghi et al 2009 2012 huang et al 2011 2012 2014 2016 replacement of a pps by a fps leads to relative deviation of 10 to 61 in sdr prediction sophocleous et al 1995 the quasi 3d flow models inside the broken line rectangle in fig 6 neglect the effect of vertical flow in aquifers of a multilayered aquifer system this will cause significant discrepancy in predicted sdr if the pumping well is close to a nearby stream huang et al 2014 in addition the analytical models of sdr induced by a rcw apply the technique of green s function and neglect the effect of frictional head loss in the laterals huang et al 2011 2012 2016 this mathematical convenience leads to inaccurate sdr in the case of long laterals and short distance from a stream to a rcw rushton and brassington 2013 4 conclusions and future recommendations stream depletion induced by extraction wells has received much attention because it could cause impact on aquatic ecosystems in rivers conflict over water rights and contaminant migration from polluted streams to irrigation wells numerous articles have been devoted to the study of stream depletion but no studies have ever tried to provide a complete framework for analytical models from aquifer viewpoint this review provides key differences in existing analytical models and serves as a guide that describes how to choose a proper analytical model to problem of concern existing analytical models are commented we would like to mention the following unsolved problems that might be of interest for the future study due to practical need of calculation efficiency coarse grids would limit the applicability of numerical models in simulating the mix of small scale pumping well and large scale stream aquifer interface werner et al 2006 the analytic element method in strack 2003 or analytical approach in huang and yeh 2016 may be a good starting point for developing a promising approach that requires no grid inside aquifer domain to achieve computing efficiency the latter has been successfully applied to 2d confined flow but not extended to 3d unconfined and leaky flows yet note that miracapillo and morel seytoux 2014 developed a local analytical procedure to couple with a regional numerical groundwater flow model without employing fine grids near the stream aquifer interface their approach may be a good reference to deal with sdr problems having large scale stream aquifer interaction analytical model of sdr for a typical stream aquifer system consisting of an aquifer beneath a pps has not been developed little attention has been given to the condition that can lead to agreement on sdrs predicted by a quasi 3d flow model and a fully 3d numerical model such as modflow in addition the validity of neglecting frictional head loss in rcw laterals for developing analytical model has never been examined this can be achieved by comparison of the analytical model with a numerical model coupling eq 1 and the darcy weisbach formula that relates the frictional head loss to average flow velocity in rcw laterals rushton and brassington 2013 these are especially noteworthy in the case of applying analytical models to issues of concern acknowledgements this study was supported by grants from the national natural science foundation of china 41561134016 and from

depletion rate sdr stream aquifer interaction analytical model image well method 1 introduction a considerable amount of stream water may flow toward a nearby well due to pumping in an aquifer which is referred to as stream depletion stream depletion is an important issue that attracts the attention of hydrologists because it may have impacts on aquatic ecosystems e g foglia et al 2013 streambed

abstraction from a well near two streams may involve conflict over water distribution regulated by water rights e g sun and zhan 2007 the stream depletion rate sdr defined as a dimensionless ratio of the volumetric rate of water abstraction from a stream to a pumping rate is an index to quantify stream depletion the sdr ranges from zero to unity if all interconnected surface water features are considered the sdr may be less than unity if derived from a particular stream or boundary segment reeves et al 2009 developed michigan water withdrawal screening tool based on the analytical solution of hunt 1999 to assess resource impacts due to water withdrawal recently hunt 2014 reviewed analytical solutions of sdr and provided a useful tool for analyzing groundwater resources function xls which can be downloaded from his website a large number of articles have addressed the problem of stream depletion but a general framework illustrating the applicability and limitations in various analytical models from aquifer viewpoint has not been presented this review illustrates key differences in existing models and serves as a guide to select an appropriate analytical model for engineering applications the target audiences are those who apply analytical approaches to solve real world problems of stream depletion at the beginning we provide a mathematical framework composed of flow equations along with associated boundary conditions bcs and source sink terms for pumped confined unconfined and leaky aquifers near a stream then we give some comments on analytical models regarding stream depletion problem finally we recommend some unsolved problems that may be of practical use in the future 2 framework of problem 2 1 flow equations the notations used in the text are

is a laplace domain solution that relies on the crump or stehfest algorithm yeh and chang 2013 for numerical inversion to obtain time domain result from those discussed above we can conclude that sdr

aquifer interface werner et al 2006 the analytic element method in strack 2003 or analytical approach in huang and yeh 2016 may be a good starting point for developing a promising approach that requires no grid inside aquifer domain to achieve computing efficiency the latter has been successfully applied to 2d confined flow but not extended to 3d unconfined and leaky flows yet note that miracapillo and morel seytoux 2014 developed a local analytical procedure to couple with a regional numerical groundwater flow model without employing fine grids near the stream aquifer interface their approach may be a good reference to deal with sdr problems having large scale stream aquifer interaction analytical model of sdr for a typical stream aquifer system consisting of an aquifer beneath a pps has not been developed little attention has been given to the condition that can lead to agreement on sdrs predicted by a quasi 3d flow model and a fully 3d numerical model such as modflow in addition the validity of neglecting frictional head loss in rcw laterals for developing analytical model has never been examined this can be achieved by comparison of the analytical model with a numerical model coupling eq 1 and the darcy weisbach formula that relates the frictional head loss to average flow velocity in rcw laterals rushton and brassington 2013 these are especially noteworthy in the case of applying analytical models to issues of concern acknowledgements this study was supported by grants from the national natural science foundation of china 41561134016 and from

gradient s flow velocity v shear stress τ stream power ω and unit stream power u on sediment concentration laboratory experiments were conducted using a 10 0 1 m rill flume under four flow discharges 2 4 8 and 16 l min 1 and five slope gradients 5 10 15 20 and 25 the results showed that the measured sediment concentration varied from 87 08 to 620 80 kg m 3 with a mean value of 343 13 kg m 3 sediment concentration increased as a power function with flow discharge and slope gradient with r2 0 975 and nse 0 945 the sediment concentration was more sensitive to slope gradient than to flow

et al 2017 owing to the highly erodible soil sparse vegetation cover and irrational land use patterns fu and gulinck 1994 zhang and liu 2005 tang 2004 the loess plateau has become one of the most severely eroded areas in the world cao et al 2009 fu et al 2009 yu et al 2014 the average annual erosion rates vary from 5000 to 10000 mg km 2 yr 1 zhang et al 2008 liu et al 2016 the massive loss of fertile top soil and nutrients has resulted in severe land degradation such serious soil erosion has a direct impact on the environment and socio economic development of the region accordingly it is essential to understand the mechanisms of soil erosion and the essences of sediment yields to identify the key factors causing erosion to formulate corresponding measures for soil and water conservation to develop physically based erosion models and to accurately forecast and control soil loss in the loess plateau early soil erosion models mainly focused on detachment capacity transport capacity and hydraulic parameters such as stream power and shear stress nearing et al 1989 hairsine and rose 1992a b govers 1992 the water erosion prediction project wepp model and the hairsine rose hr model among others are the two most typical examples the hr model rose et al 1983a b hairsine and rose 1991 1992a b is based on an approach where sediment transport by overland flow is characterized by simultaneous deposition temporary settlement and re entrainment temporary detachment both sediment entrainment and re entrainment are assumed to be proportional to the excess stream power the following equation is proposed for sediment entrainment 1 d r 1 h w 2 d f ω ω c ij where dr is the detachment rate kg m 1 s 1 w is the base width of the rill m h is the fraction of the rill wetted perimeter base covered by deposited sediment f is the fraction of excess stream power ω ωc used in entraining or re entraining sediment in class size i ωc is the stream power below which no entrainment occurs kg s 3 i is the number of settling velocity classes j is the specific energy of entrainment j kg 1 or m2 s 2 d is the depth of the rill m the wepp model is a physically based model used for sediment transport and soil erosion modelling at inter rill or rill areas nearing et al 1989 the wepp model uses a steady state sediment continuity equation to calculate net detachment and deposition among which rill detachment rate depends on hydraulic shear stress and the ratio of sediment load to sediment transport capacity in the rill the model is described by 2 dg dx d f d i 3 d f d c 1 g t c 4 d c k r τ f τ c where g is the sediment load kg s 1 m 1 df is the rill erosion rate kg s 1 m 2 di is the inter rill erosion rate kg s 1 m 2 dc is the detachment capacity by flow kg s 1 m 2 tc is the sediment transport capacity in the rill kg s 1 m 1 kr is a rill soil erodibility parameter s m 1 τf is the flow shear stress pa τc is the critical shear stress pa nearing et al 1989 believed that soil detachment is the process of separation of soil particles from the soil matrix by hydraulic shear stress when hydraulic shear stress is less than critical shear stress rill detachment is considered to be zero soil erosion occurs when the shear stress exerted by flow exceeds the critical shear stress for the soil after the introduction of the wepp model and the hr model a few studies have been conducted in the past few decades to predict soil detachment capacity and sediment transport using hydraulic parameters govers and rauws 1986 and govers 1992b found that grain shear stress or unit stream power were the best hydraulic parameters to predict transporting capacity of overland flow for fine sediments 200 μm govers and rauws 1986 govers 1992b zhang et al 2009 developed a model for estimating sediment transport capacity on the basis of hydraulic parameters under various conditions tayfur 2002 2007 developed the transport capacity models based on one of the commonly employed dominant variables such as stream power unit stream power and shear stress under different rainfall intensities aksoy et al 2013 developed the empirical sediment transport models according to the analyses of the effects of slope gradient flow discharge rainfall intensity and sediment size on sediment transport aksoy et al 2013 aksoy et al 2016 aksoy et al 2017 however those experiments did not include the study of sediment concentration the process of soil erosion generally defined as a sequence of soil detachment sediment transport and deposition is a dynamic and intricate process zhang et al 2008 sediment concentration as an important parameter throughout the process plays an important role in the study of soil erosion in particular at the end of the rill the sediment concentration determines how much sediment is delivered and deposited down the hillside and through the stream system most stream sediment transport models also tend to study sediment concentration rather than sediment delivery therefore further detailed studies on sediment concentration are necessary a number of methods have been used for measuring sediment concentration guy et al 1987 abrahams and atkinson 1993 li et al 2005 willis and bolton 1979 lei et al 2002 lei et al 2003 li et al 2002 li et al 2005 campbell et al 2005 downing 2006 the oven dry method is considered to be one of the most accurate and precise methods for measuring sediment concentration einstein 1950 guy et al 1987 however the measured values of sediment concentration are somewhat smaller than the actual values due to the oven dry method that needs a high temperature and prolonged heating which will cause organic matter in the soil to be oxidized in addition the requirements for drying temperature and heating time also make the whole measuring process time consuming and laborious stated thus developing the sediment concentration models is essential numerous investigations have been conducted to study the hydraulic parameters related to soil erosion foster et al 1984 nearing et al 1999 govers 1992 nearing et al 1989 hairsine and rose 1992a b tayfur 2002 aksoy et al 2013 wagenbrenner et al 2010 zhang et al 2009 these studies indicated that shear stress nearing et al 1989 zhang et al 2003 stream power hairsine and rose 1992a b nearing et al 1990 unit stream power govers 1992b and unit length shear force giménez and govers 2002 can be used as the best predictors for the model however very few studies have been designed to investigate the relationship between hydraulic parameters and sediment concentration lei et al 2001 conducted a series of experiments in laboratory to regress the relationship between sediment concentration and rill length the resulting equation was 5 c a 1 e β x b where a and b are the regression coefficients c is the sediment concentration g ml 1 x is the rill length m β is the reduction coefficient the expression indicates that sediment concentration increases with rill length until it reaches a maximum value and the corresponding transport capacity is the maximum transport capacity however as the coefficients in the formula corresponding to different values under various conditions the factors such as rill length slope gradient and flow discharge need to be considered in the process of the calculation in a practical application the estimation errors of sediment concentration calculated by this equation were too large under the low flow discharges and slope gradients thus the scope of application was subjected to certain restrictions therefore there is a need for a study to determine how to best relate rill hydraulic properties to sediment concentration the objectives of this study were to evaluate the effects of flow discharge slope gradient flow velocity shear stress stream power and unit stream power on sediment concentration and to develop the sediment concentration models based on hydraulic parameters 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and test soil the experimental soil samples were collected from ansai field station of the institute of soil and water conservation 109 19 23 e 36 51 30 n located near the centre of the loess plateau china fig 1 the region has a typical semiarid continental climate the average annual precipitation is 500 mm and mean annual temperature is 8 8 c the elevation varies from 1068 to 1309 m the region belongs to the forest steppe zone the soil is characterized as loessial soil with a homogeneous silt loam texture and is easily eroded the test soil was air dried and crushed to pass through a 10 mm sieve to remove stones grass roots and other debris the test soil was then packed 25 cm deep in the flume in five 5 cm layers to achieve a bulk density of 1 5 g cm 3 before each layer was packed the soil layer was raked lightly to diminish the discontinuity between layers after packing in the flume the flume soil was saturated and allowed to settle for 24 h to eliminate effects of uneven packing and provide a uniform initial water content distribution 2 2 experiment facilities the study was carried out in the simulation rainfall hall of the institute of soil and water conservation chinese academy of sciences cas and ministry of water resources mwr in yangling shaanxi province china the experimental flume used in this study was about 12 m long and 1 m wide the flume was divided into sections of 10 0 1 m2 using steel plates of 0 3 m height to fix the width of the rill fig 2 the slope gradients of the flume could be adjusted between 0 and 30 flow discharge was controlled by a set of valves installed on a flow diversion bin and measured by a calibrated flow meter 2 3 experimental design according to the chinese soil and water conservation act the slope gradient of 25 corresponds with the maximum slope gradient for cultivated land therefore five slope gradients 5 10 15 20 and 25 were used in this study according to the critical flow discharge and the critical rainfall intensity 0 5 0 6 mm min 1 of rill erosion on the loess plateau shao et al 2004 four flow discharges 2 4 8 and 16 l min 1 were selected different flow discharges and slope gradients were combined to simulate the process of rill erosion from gentle slope gradients to steeper slope gradients to ensure the reliability and accuracy of the experiments three replicates were conducted for a total of 60 experimental runs 2 4 acquisition of parameters 2 4 1 measurement velocity of the flow surface was measured by dye tracer technique the dye was added at the outlet of the flowing water when the flow stabilized the time interval for the tracer to move from the outlet to the end of the flume was recorded using a digital stop watch velocity measurements were replicated three times the mean flow velocity was estimated by multiplying the surface velocity by 0 75 luk and merz 1992 after water flowing in a rill became stable three sediment samples were collected from the outlet of a rill the sediment concentration was determined with the traditional oven dry method 2 4 2 hydraulic parameters shear stress nearing et al 1991 unit stream

with different slope gradients and flow discharges the measured sediment concentration varied from 87 08 to 620 80 kg m 3 the measured sediment concentration increased as the flow discharge increased as expected when the flow discharge increased from 2 to 8 l min 1 the sediment concentration increased on average by 78 67 percent under different slope gradients indicating that the sediment concentration was strongly influenced by flow discharge nevertheless when the flow discharge increased from 8 to 16 l min 1 the sediment concentration increased on average by 21 65 percent under different slope gradients indicating that the increments of sediment concentration decreased with increasing flow discharges under different flow discharges the measured sediment concentration increased rapidly with increasing slope gradient the increments of sediment concentration were relatively uniform consequently the sediment concentration was more sensitive to slope gradient than to flow discharge for example when the slope gradient was 5 the sediment concentration increased on average by 29 48 percent as flow discharge increased when the flow discharge was 2 l min 1 the sediment concentration increased on average by 50 27 percent as slope gradient increased table 1 shows the relationship of sediment concentration with flow discharge and slope gradient sediment concentration increased as a power function with flow discharge at various slope gradients and the exponents of flow discharge ranged from 0 174 to 0 389 with a mean value of 0 312 sediment concentration increased as a power function with slope gradient at various flow discharges and the exponents of slope gradient ranged from 0 746 to 0 989 with a mean value of 0 867 the exponents of slope gradient were much greater than that of flow discharge indicating that the sediment concentration was strongly influenced by slope gradient the relationship between sediment concentration and flow discharge at all combinations of slope gradients fitted a power function with r2 0 189 and nse 0 168 the relationship between sediment concentration and slope gradient at all combinations of flow discharges fitted a power function with r2 0 786 and nse 0 752 the plot slope was a better predictor of sediment concentration than the flow discharge this suggests that the slope gradient should be selected as a simulated parameter preferentially when calculating sediment concentration in order to evaluate the relationship of sediment concentration with flow discharge and slope gradient nonlinear regression analyses were conducted to produce the following relationship 15 c 18 895 s 0 867 q 0 312 r 2 0 975 nse 0 945 where c is the sediment concentration kg m 3 s is the slope gradient q is the flow discharge l min 1 comparisons between measured and predicted sediment concentrations using eq 15 are plotted in fig 4 as shown in fig 4 the predicted sediment concentrations showed good agreement with the measured values and the plotted data all agreed well with the 1 1 line moreover the predicted sediment concentrations were in good linear relationship with the measured values r2 0 957 when the sediment concentration was greater than 600 kg m 3 the predicted sediment concentrations were slightly larger than the measured values but overall eq 15 could be used to predict sediment concentration well 3 2 sediment concentration estimated by flow velocity flow velocity is a common hydraulic parameter in the study of soil erosion the mean flow velocity is necessary in soil erosion modeling since it is closely related to slope gradient flow depth and discharge topography and surface conditions fig 5 shows the variation of sediment concentration with mean flow velocity the measured sediment concentration increased as the mean flow velocity increased at various slope gradients fig 5 the mean flow velocity increased on average by 140 68 percent and the sediment concentration increased on average by 116 32 percent under slope gradients of 5 10 and 15 indicating that the sediment concentration was strongly influenced by mean flow velocity under slope gradients of 5 10 and 15 however the mean flow velocity increased on average by 199 11 percent and the sediment concentration increased on average by 55 22 percent under slope gradients of 20 and 25 indicating that the increments of sediment concentration decreased with increasing flow velocities under slope gradients of 20 and 25 sediment concentration increased as a power function with flow velocity at various slope gradients with r2 0 850 table 2 the relationship between sediment concentration and flow velocity at all combinations of slope gradients and flow discharges were fitted a power function the resulting equation was 16 c 703 730 v 1 029 r 2 0 470 nse 0 539 comparisons between measured and predicted sediment concentrations using eq 16 are plotted in fig 6 as shown in fig 6 some points were quite far from 1 1 line there was a large gap between predicted sediment concentrations and measured values apparently eq 16 is not a good predictor of sediment concentration 3 3 sediment concentration estimated by shear stress the wepp model uses shear to predict soil detachment nearing et al 1989 fig 7 shows the variation of sediment concentration with shear stress the measured sediment concentration increased as the shear stress increased at various slope gradients and flow discharges fig 7 the relationship was a power function for both flow discharges and slope gradients with r2 0 900 table 3 further analysis showed that the values of sediment concentration varied at similar levels of shear stress for example when the flow discharge was 2 l min 1 and the slope gradient was 25 shear stress equaled 4 524 pa and the sediment concentration was 430 27 kg m 3 when the flow discharge was 4 l min 1 and the slope gradient was 15 shear stress equaled 4 654 pa while the sediment concentration was only 311 23 kg m 3 the result indicated that the variation of sediment concentration was influenced by both flow discharge and steepness when using a shear model the relationship between sediment concentration and shear stress at all combinations of slope gradients and flow discharges were fitted a power function the regression equation was as follows 17 c 82 405 τ 0 857 r 2 0 888 nse 0 853 eq 17 simulated the sediment concentration satisfactorily fig 8 the plotted data all agreed well with the 1 1 line however the predictive efficiency of eq 17 was less than that of eq 15 3 4 sediment concentration estimated by stream power the measured sediment concentration increased as the stream power increased fig 9 the sediment concentration was well simulated by stream power with a power function under a given slope gradient and flow discharge table 4 the exponents of stream power decreased from 1 004 to 0 739 and the coefficients decreased from 300 30 to 116 41 as the flow discharge increased indicating that as flow discharge increased the sediment concentration did not increase as much with stream power the relationship between sediment concentration and stream power at all combinations of slope gradients and flow discharges were fitted a power function the regression equation was as follows 18 c 211 132 ω 0 518 r 2 0 773 nse 0 732 comparisons between measured and predicted sediment concentrations using eq 18 are plotted in fig 10 as shown in fig 10 most of the points were quite far from the 1 1 line the comparison of observed and predicted sediment concentrations indicated that sediment concentration was not well predicted by eq 18 the predictive efficiency of eq 18 was lower than that of eqs 15 and 17 3 5 sediment concentration estimated by unit stream power the measured sediment concentration increased as the unit stream power increased fig 11 the best fitting equation between sediment concentration and unit stream power was a power function under a given slope gradient and flow discharge table 5 the exponents and the coefficients of unit stream power decreased as the flow discharge increased indicating that as flow discharge and slope gradient increased the sediment concentration did not increase as much with unit stream power the relationship between sediment concentration and unit stream power at all combinations of slope gradients and flow discharges were fitted a power function the resulting equation was 19 c 1512 593 u 0 696 r 2 0 937 nse 0 865 comparisons between measured and predicted sediment concentrations using eq 19 are plotted in fig 12 as shown in fig 12 the predicted sediment concentrations were relatively close to the measured values when the sediment concentration was greater than 620 kg m 3 the predicted sediment concentrations were slightly greater than the measured values when sediment concentration was less than 620 kg m 3 the plotted data all agreed well with the 1 1 line the predicted sediment concentrations were in good linear relationship with the measured values r2 0 902 thus eq 19 simulated the measured sediment concentration satisfactorily 4 assessment of equations to clearly evaluate the performance of eqs 15 19 in predicting sediment concentration the assessment indexes including re rrmse nse r2 mre and mare were used table 6 presents the results of the assessment when these equations are used to predict sediment concentration as shown in table 6 eqs 15 and 19 were the best options for predicting sediment concentration the re of eq 15 varied from 17 785 to 11 669 percent and the mre was only 0 361 percent the re of eq 19 varied from 27 936 to 16 732 percent and the mre was only 0 987 percent the predicted sediment concentrations were slightly larger than the measured values when the slope gradient was 25 and the flow discharge was 16 l min 1 fig 4 or the slope gradient was 20 and the flow discharge was 16 l min 1 fig 12 but overall eq 15 and 19 could be used to predict sediment concentration well consequently flow discharge slope gradient and unit stream power were good predictors of sediment concentration whereas flow velocity and stream power were not good predictors of sediment concentration to further evaluate the suitability of the equations established in this study the experimental data sets from previous study luo 2016 were used their experiment on rill erosion involved three flow discharges 2 4 and 8 l min 1 and five slope gradients 5 10 15 20 and 25 the bulk density was 1 2 g cm 3 in contrast to the experiment using loess soil in this study the experiment of luo 2016 was conducted using a clay loam soil the particle fractions of the two soils are listed in table 7 the experimental data from luo 2016 are shown in table 8 to clearly evaluate the suitability of the five equations eq 15 19 in predicting sediment concentration the assessment indexes including re rrmse mre and mare were used table 9 the re predicted with eq 17 varied from 15 528 to 65 519 percent table 9 the predicted sediment concentrations were less than the measured values the estimation errors of sediment concentration calculated by eqs 16 and 18 were too large and the predicted sediment concentrations seriously deviated from the measured values in general eqs 15 and 19 were the best options for predicting sediment concentration the re of eq 15 varied from 8 296 to 36 630 percent and the mre was only 18 675 percent the re of eq 19 varied from 40 814 to 17 005 percent and the mre was only 4 201 percent and the mare and the rrmse of these two equations were lower than those of the other three equations the predicted sediment concentrations plotted mostly along the 1 1 line although there were points plotted below or above that line fig 13 thus the sediment concentrations calculated by eqs 15 and 19 matched the measured values of luo 2016 under normal conditions the erosion rates of silt loam soils are higher than that of clay loam soils the predicted concentration equations from a silt loam soil could be used to predict the observed concentrations for a silt loam soil which might be related to the different bulk densities of two studies theoretically the smaller the bulk density the looser the soil structure the more vulnerable to soil erosion the more sediment concentrations will be produced 5 conclusions in this study the relationships of sediment concentration with flow discharge slope gradient flow velocity shear stress stream power and unit stream power were investigated the results of this study showed that flow discharge slope gradient and unit stream power were good predictors of sediment concentration the relationships of measured sediment concentration to slope gradient flow discharge and unit stream power could be described by power functions in addition using the equations to simulate the measured sediment concentration of other studies it was found that a flow and slope model and a shear model were more applicable than the other three models in general the equations established in this study can facilitate the prediction of sediment concentration however these equations should be used judiciously consequently the additional research is needed to further validate the applicability of the equations and to further improve the simulation accuracy of the equations acknowledgements this

commonly employed dominant variables such as stream power unit stream power and shear stress under different rainfall intensities aksoy et al 2013 developed the empirical sediment transport models according to the analyses of the effects of slope gradient flow discharge rainfall intensity and sediment size on sediment transport aksoy et al 2013 aksoy et al 2016 aksoy et al 2017 however those experiments did not include the study of sediment concentration the process of soil erosion generally defined as a sequence of soil detachment sediment transport and deposition is a dynamic and intricate process zhang et al 2008 sediment concentration as an important parameter throughout the process plays an important role in the study of soil erosion in particular at the end of the rill the sediment concentration determines how much sediment is delivered and deposited down the hillside and through the stream system most stream sediment transport models also tend to study sediment concentration rather than sediment delivery therefore further detailed studies on sediment concentration are necessary a number of methods have been used for measuring sediment concentration guy et al 1987 abrahams and atkinson 1993 li et al 2005 willis and bolton 1979 lei et al 2002 lei et al 2003 li et al 2002 li et al 2005 campbell et al 2005 downing 2006 the oven dry method is considered to be one of the most accurate and precise methods for measuring sediment concentration einstein 1950 guy et al 1987 however the measured values of sediment concentration are somewhat smaller than the actual values due to the oven dry method that needs a high temperature and prolonged heating which will cause organic matter in the soil to be oxidized in addition the requirements for drying temperature and heating time also make the whole measuring process time consuming and laborious stated thus developing the sediment concentration models is essential numerous investigations have been conducted to study the hydraulic parameters related to soil erosion foster et al 1984 nearing et al 1999 govers 1992 nearing et al 1989 hairsine and rose 1992a b tayfur 2002 aksoy et al 2013 wagenbrenner et al 2010 zhang et al 2009 these studies indicated that shear stress nearing et al 1989 zhang et al 2003 stream power hairsine and rose 1992a b nearing et al 1990 unit stream power govers 1992b and unit length shear force giménez and govers 2002 can be used as the best predictors for the model however very few studies have been designed to investigate the relationship between hydraulic parameters and sediment concentration lei et al 2001 conducted a series of experiments in laboratory to regress the relationship between sediment concentration and rill length the resulting equation was 5 c a 1 e β x b where a and b are the regression coefficients c is the sediment concentration g ml 1 x is the rill length m β is the reduction coefficient the expression indicates that sediment concentration increases with rill length until it reaches a maximum value and the corresponding transport capacity is the maximum transport capacity however as the coefficients in the formula corresponding to different values under various conditions the factors such as rill length slope gradient and flow discharge need to be considered in the process of the calculation in a practical application the estimation errors of sediment concentration calculated by this equation were too large under the low flow discharges and slope gradients thus the scope of application was subjected to certain restrictions therefore there is a need for a study to determine how to best relate rill hydraulic properties to sediment concentration the objectives of this study were to evaluate the effects of flow discharge slope gradient flow velocity shear stress stream power and unit stream power on sediment concentration and to develop the sediment concentration models based on hydraulic parameters 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and test soil the experimental soil samples were collected from ansai field station of the institute of soil and water conservation 109 19 23 e 36 51 30 n located near the centre of the loess plateau china fig 1 the region has a typical semiarid continental climate the average annual precipitation is 500 mm and mean annual temperature is 8 8 c the elevation varies from 1068 to 1309 m the region belongs to the forest steppe zone the soil is characterized as loessial soil with a homogeneous silt loam texture and is easily eroded the test soil was air dried and crushed to pass through a 10 mm sieve to remove stones grass roots and other debris the test soil was then packed 25 cm deep in the flume in five 5 cm layers to achieve a bulk density of 1 5 g cm 3 before each layer was packed the soil layer was raked lightly to diminish the discontinuity between layers after packing in the flume the flume soil was saturated and allowed to settle for 24 h to eliminate effects of uneven packing and provide a uniform initial water content distribution 2 2 experiment facilities the study was carried out in the simulation rainfall hall of the institute of soil and water conservation chinese academy of sciences cas and ministry of water resources mwr in yangling shaanxi province china the experimental flume used in this study was about 12 m long and 1 m wide the flume was divided into sections of 10 0 1 m2 using steel plates of 0 3 m height to fix the width of the rill fig 2 the slope gradients of the flume could be adjusted between 0 and 30 flow discharge was controlled by a set of valves installed on a flow diversion bin and measured by a calibrated flow meter 2 3 experimental design according to the chinese soil and water conservation act the slope gradient of 25 corresponds with the maximum slope gradient for cultivated land therefore five slope gradients 5 10 15 20 and 25 were used in this study according to the critical flow discharge and the critical rainfall intensity 0 5 0 6 mm min 1 of rill erosion on the loess plateau shao et al 2004 four flow discharges 2 4 8 and 16 l min 1 were selected different flow discharges and slope gradients were combined to simulate the process of rill erosion from gentle slope gradients to steeper slope gradients to ensure the reliability and accuracy of the experiments three replicates were conducted for a total of 60 experimental runs 2 4 acquisition of parameters 2 4 1 measurement velocity of the flow surface was measured by dye tracer technique the dye was added at the outlet of the flowing water when the flow stabilized the time interval for the tracer to move from the outlet to the end of the flume was recorded using a digital stop watch velocity measurements were replicated three times the mean flow velocity was estimated by multiplying the surface velocity by 0 75 luk and merz 1992 after water flowing in a rill became stable three sediment samples were collected from the outlet of a rill the sediment concentration was determined with the traditional oven dry method 2 4 2 hydraulic parameters shear stress nearing et al 1991 unit stream

with different slope gradients and flow discharges the measured sediment concentration varied from 87 08 to 620 80 kg m 3 the measured sediment concentration increased as the flow discharge increased as expected when the flow discharge increased from 2 to 8 l min 1 the sediment concentration increased on average by 78 67 percent under different slope gradients indicating that the sediment concentration was strongly influenced by flow discharge nevertheless when the flow discharge increased from 8 to 16 l min 1 the sediment concentration increased on average by 21 65 percent under different slope gradients indicating that the increments of sediment concentration decreased with increasing flow discharges under different flow discharges the measured sediment concentration increased rapidly with increasing slope gradient the increments of sediment concentration were relatively uniform consequently the sediment concentration was more sensitive to slope gradient than to flow discharge for example when the slope gradient was 5 the sediment concentration increased on average by 29 48 percent as flow discharge increased when the flow discharge was 2 l min 1 the sediment concentration increased on average by 50 27 percent as slope gradient increased table 1 shows the relationship of sediment concentration with flow discharge and slope gradient sediment concentration increased as a power function with flow discharge at various slope gradients and the exponents of flow discharge ranged from 0 174 to 0 389 with a mean value of 0 312 sediment concentration increased as a power function with slope gradient at various flow discharges and the exponents of slope gradient ranged from 0 746 to 0 989 with a mean value of 0 867 the exponents of slope gradient were much greater than that of flow discharge indicating that the sediment concentration was strongly influenced by slope gradient the relationship between sediment concentration and flow discharge at all combinations of slope gradients fitted a power function with r2 0 189 and nse 0 168 the relationship between sediment concentration and slope gradient at all combinations of flow discharges fitted a power function with r2 0 786 and nse 0 752 the plot slope was a better predictor of sediment concentration than the flow discharge this suggests that the slope gradient should be selected as a simulated parameter preferentially when calculating sediment concentration in order to evaluate the relationship of sediment concentration with flow discharge and slope gradient nonlinear regression analyses were conducted to produce the following relationship 15 c 18 895 s 0 867 q 0 312 r 2 0 975 nse 0 945 where c is the sediment concentration kg m 3 s is the slope gradient q is the flow discharge l min 1 comparisons between measured and predicted sediment concentrations using eq 15 are plotted in fig 4 as shown in fig 4 the predicted sediment concentrations showed good agreement with the measured values and the plotted data all agreed well with the 1 1 line moreover the predicted sediment concentrations were in good linear relationship with the measured values r2 0 957 when the sediment concentration was greater than 600 kg m 3 the predicted sediment concentrations were slightly larger than the measured values but overall eq 15 could be used to predict sediment concentration well 3 2 sediment concentration estimated by flow velocity flow velocity is a common hydraulic parameter in the study of soil erosion the mean flow velocity is necessary in soil erosion modeling since it is closely related to slope gradient flow depth and discharge topography and surface conditions fig 5 shows the variation of sediment concentration with mean flow velocity the measured sediment concentration increased as the mean flow velocity increased at various slope gradients fig 5 the mean flow velocity increased on average by 140 68 percent and the sediment concentration increased on average by 116 32 percent under slope gradients of 5 10 and 15 indicating that the sediment concentration was strongly influenced by mean flow velocity under slope gradients of 5 10 and 15 however the mean flow velocity increased on average by 199 11 percent and the sediment concentration increased on average by 55 22 percent under slope gradients of 20 and 25 indicating that the increments of sediment concentration decreased with increasing flow velocities under slope gradients of 20 and 25 sediment concentration increased as a power function with flow velocity at various slope gradients with r2 0 850 table 2 the relationship between sediment concentration and flow velocity at all combinations of slope gradients and flow discharges were fitted a power function the resulting equation was 16 c 703 730 v 1 029 r 2 0 470 nse 0 539 comparisons between measured and predicted sediment concentrations using eq 16 are plotted in fig 6 as shown in fig 6 some points were quite far from 1 1 line there was a large gap between predicted sediment concentrations and measured values apparently eq 16 is not a good predictor of sediment concentration 3 3 sediment concentration estimated by shear stress the wepp model uses shear to predict soil detachment nearing et al 1989 fig 7 shows the variation of sediment concentration with shear stress the measured sediment concentration increased as the shear stress increased at various slope gradients and flow discharges fig 7 the relationship was a power function for both flow discharges and slope gradients with r2 0 900 table 3 further analysis showed that the values of sediment concentration varied at similar levels of shear stress for example when the flow discharge was 2 l min 1 and the slope gradient was 25 shear stress equaled 4 524 pa and the sediment concentration was 430 27 kg m 3 when the flow discharge was 4 l min 1 and the slope gradient was 15 shear stress equaled 4 654 pa while the sediment concentration was only 311 23 kg m 3 the result indicated that the variation of sediment concentration was influenced by both flow discharge and steepness when using a shear model the relationship between sediment concentration and shear stress at all combinations of slope gradients and flow discharges were fitted a power function the regression equation was as follows 17 c 82 405 τ 0 857 r 2 0 888 nse 0 853 eq 17 simulated the sediment concentration satisfactorily fig 8 the plotted data all agreed well with the 1 1 line however the predictive efficiency of eq 17 was less than that of eq 15 3 4 sediment concentration estimated by stream power the measured sediment concentration increased as the stream power increased fig 9 the sediment concentration was well simulated by stream power with a power function under a given slope gradient and flow discharge table 4 the exponents of stream power decreased from 1 004 to 0 739 and the coefficients decreased from 300 30 to 116 41 as the flow discharge increased indicating that as flow discharge increased the sediment concentration did not increase as much with stream power the relationship between sediment concentration and stream power at all combinations of slope gradients and flow discharges were fitted a power function the regression equation was as follows 18 c 211 132 ω 0 518 r 2 0 773 nse 0 732 comparisons between measured and predicted sediment concentrations using eq 18 are plotted in fig 10 as shown in fig 10 most of the points were quite far from the 1 1 line the comparison of observed and predicted sediment concentrations indicated that sediment concentration was not well predicted by eq 18 the predictive efficiency of eq 18 was lower than that of eqs 15 and 17 3 5 sediment concentration estimated by unit stream power the measured sediment concentration increased as the unit stream power increased fig 11 the best fitting equation between sediment concentration and unit stream power was a power function under a given slope gradient and flow discharge table 5 the exponents and the coefficients of unit stream power decreased as the flow discharge increased indicating that as flow discharge and slope gradient increased the sediment concentration did not increase as much with unit stream power the relationship between sediment concentration and unit stream power at all combinations of slope gradients and flow discharges were fitted a power function the resulting equation was 19 c 1512 593 u 0 696 r 2 0 937 nse 0 865 comparisons between measured and predicted sediment concentrations using eq 19 are plotted in fig 12 as shown in fig 12 the predicted sediment concentrations were relatively close to the measured values when the sediment concentration was greater than 620 kg m 3 the predicted sediment concentrations were slightly greater than the measured values when sediment concentration was less than 620 kg m 3 the plotted data all agreed well with the 1 1 line the predicted sediment concentrations were in good linear relationship with the measured values r2 0 902 thus eq 19 simulated the measured sediment concentration satisfactorily 4 assessment of equations to clearly evaluate the performance of eqs 15 19 in predicting sediment concentration the assessment indexes including re rrmse nse r2 mre and mare were used table 6 presents the results of the assessment when these equations are used to predict sediment concentration as shown in table 6 eqs 15 and 19 were the best options for predicting sediment concentration the re of eq 15 varied from 17 785 to 11 669 percent and the mre was only 0 361 percent the re of eq 19 varied from 27 936 to 16 732 percent and the mre was only 0 987 percent the predicted sediment concentrations were slightly larger than the measured values when the slope gradient was 25 and the flow discharge was 16 l min 1 fig 4 or the slope gradient was 20 and the flow discharge was 16 l min 1 fig 12 but overall eq 15 and 19 could be used to predict sediment concentration well consequently flow discharge slope gradient and unit stream power were good predictors of sediment concentration whereas flow velocity and stream power were not good predictors of sediment concentration to further evaluate the suitability of the equations established in this study the experimental data sets from previous study luo 2016 were used their experiment on rill erosion involved three flow discharges 2 4 and 8 l min 1 and five slope gradients 5 10 15 20 and 25 the bulk density was 1 2 g cm 3 in contrast to the experiment using loess soil in this study the experiment of luo 2016 was conducted using a clay loam soil the particle fractions of the two soils are listed in table 7 the experimental data from luo 2016 are shown in table 8 to clearly evaluate the suitability of the five equations eq 15 19 in predicting sediment concentration the assessment indexes including re rrmse mre and mare were used table 9 the re predicted with eq 17 varied from 15 528 to 65 519 percent table 9 the predicted sediment concentrations were less than the measured values the estimation errors of sediment concentration calculated by eqs 16 and 18 were too large and the predicted sediment concentrations seriously deviated from the measured values in general eqs 15 and 19 were the best options for predicting sediment concentration the re of eq 15 varied from 8 296 to 36 630 percent and the mre was only 18 675 percent the re of eq 19 varied from 40 814 to 17 005 percent and the mre was only 4 201 percent and the mare and the rrmse of these two equations were lower than those of the other three equations the predicted sediment concentrations plotted mostly along the 1 1 line although there were points plotted below or above that line fig 13 thus the sediment concentrations calculated by eqs 15 and 19 matched the measured values of luo 2016 under normal conditions the erosion rates of silt loam soils are higher than that of clay loam soils the predicted concentration equations from a silt loam soil could be used to predict the observed concentrations for a silt loam soil which might be related to the different bulk densities of two studies theoretically the smaller the bulk density the looser the soil structure the more vulnerable to soil erosion the more sediment concentrations will be produced 5 conclusions in this study the relationships of sediment concentration with flow discharge slope gradient flow velocity shear stress stream power and unit stream power were investigated the results of this study showed that flow discharge slope gradient and unit stream power were good predictors of sediment concentration the relationships of measured sediment concentration to slope gradient flow discharge and unit stream power could be described by power functions in addition using the equations to simulate the measured sediment concentration of other studies it was found that a flow and slope model and a shear model were more applicable than the other three models in general the equations established in this study can facilitate the prediction of sediment concentration however these equations should be used judiciously consequently the additional research is needed to further validate the applicability of the equations and to further improve the simulation accuracy of the equations acknowledgements this

7279,studying solute dispersion in channel flows is of significance for environmental and industrial applications two dimensional concentration distribution for a most typical case of a point source release on the free water surface in a channel flow with bed absorption is presented by means of chatwin s long time asymptotic technique five basic characteristics of taylor dispersion and vertical mean concentration distribution with skewness and kurtosis modifications are also analyzed the results reveal that bed absorption affects both the longitudinal and vertical concentration distributions and causes the contaminant cloud to concentrate in the upper layer additionally the cross sectional concentration distribution shows an asymptotic gaussian distribution at large time which is unaffected by the bed absorption the vertical concentration distribution is found to be nonuniform even at large time the obtained results are essential for practical implements with strict environmental standards keywords vertical concentration distribution bed absorption point source taylor dispersion open channel flow 1 introduction studying solute dispersion in channel flows is of great significance for environmental and industrial applications such as environmental risk assessment wastewater treatment engineering and ecological restoration fischer 1976 1973 guerrero et al 2010 wu et al 2011 wu and chen 2012 to comprehend the transport process of solute in flows taylor dispersion emerges as a fundamental concept which refers to the process that injected solute spreads under the combined effects of velocity non uniformity and diffusion the long term evolution of transverse mean concentration distribution can be described by a diffusion like model corresponding to a gaussian distribution taylor 1953 1954 the effective diffusivity has been verified by aris s moments analysis aris 1956 and chatwin s long time asymptotic technique chatwin 1970 this classic model has attracted extensive attention and found wide applications davidson and schroter 1983 grotberg et al 1990 sarkar and jayaraman 2002 shankar and lenhoff 1991 yasuda 1984 particularly numerous studies on solute dispersion in open channel flows wang and chen 2016a li et al 2017 ng 2000 ng and yip 2001 wetland flows wang and huai 2018 luo et al 2017 jiang et al 2017 luo et al 2016 chen 2013 tube flows wang et al 2015 ng 2002 wu and chen 2012 or natural rivers wang et al 2017 wang and huai 2016 etc have been conducted among these applications many studies focused on the model of taylor dispersion with bed absorption berkowitz and zhou 1996 berkowitz 2002 wang and chen 2016b which can characterize the ecological effects of the natural water bodies in degrading pollutants dagan 1987 zeng et al 2010 berkowitz 2002 wu et al 2011 for example smith 1983 smith 1986 studied the effect of boundary absorption upon longitudinal dispersion in shear flows mazumder and das 1992 revealed that the dispersion coefficient decreases with the absorption parameter and the increased wall absorption causes negatively skewed deviations from gaussianity mondal and mazumder 2005 presented the longitudinal dispersion of passive tracer molecules released in an incompressible viscous fluid flowing through a channel with reactive walls under the active walls moreover ng 2006 determined the taylor dispersion coefficients in the one dimensional effective diffusion equation for solute dispersion in an open channel flow with boundary reaction nevertheless these studies exclusively focused on the asymptotic mean concentration distribution of the solute transport process and assessment of the absorption effect was simply based on the longitudinal mean concentration berkowitz and zhou 1996 actually the cross sectional concentration distribution is far from uniform at the initial time and even for a long time wu et al 2011 wu and chen 2014a wang et al 2013 2015 wang and chen 2016c moreover the effect of bed absorption further reshapes the vertical concentration distribution to form larger nonuniformity sankarasubramanian and gill 1973 wang and chen 2016b in many practical applications such as environmental risk assessment zeng et al 2014 most concerned indicator is the influenced region where the concentration is beyond some given environmental standards apparently the influenced region is sensitive to the detailed cross sectional concentration distribution rather than the cross sectional mean therefore there remains a need for vertical concentration distribution recent efforts have been undertaken to study the cross sectional or vertical concentration distribution in various flows by different methods to be specific wu and chen 2014b presented explicit solutions for the cross sectional concentration distribution in a pipe flow by perturbation analysis as verified and extended in wang and chen 2016c in terms of the aris gill expansion later wang and chen 2017b illustrated the two dimensional concentration distribution in wetland flow with bulk degradation and bed absorption with the method of concentration moments it is worth noting that wang and chen 2016b studied the vertical concentration distribution for solute dispersion in an open channel flow with bed absorption by extending the aris gill expansion aris 1956 gill 1967 gill and sankarasubramanian 1970 their results verified that there exists a tremendous non uniformity in the vertical concentration distribution however these studies consistently adopted the initial condition of an uniform and instantaneous contaminant release over the cross section of flows for a point source release on the free water surface in a channel flow which is a most practical case in environmental risk assessment as encountered in the leakage of toxic chemicals in waters fischer et al 1979 fu et al 2016 the vertical concentration distribution will be more nonuniform which should be further investigated latini and bernoff 2001 disclosed that there are three regimes for the classical problem of dispersion of a point discharge of tracer in laminar pipe poiseuille flow and only at large times the flow is in the classical taylor regime for which the tracer is homogenized transversely across the pipe and diffuses with a gaussian distribution longitudinally therefore the full time evolution of the concentration distribution of the contaminant transport process from a point source release in a channel flow needs to be studied which is critical to environmental risk assessment wang and chen 2016a in this regard for point source release on the free water surface recently fu et al 2016 have revealed an additional longitudinal displacement for contaminant dispersion in a wetland flow without bed absorption their work focused on the transverse mean concentration distribution at large time in this study efforts will be made to present general solutions by considering the skewness and kurtosis of the concentration distribution in the initial time and analyzing the effect of bed absorption on the dispersion process in this work we theoretically study the contaminant transport from a point source release on the water surface in an open channel flow with bed absorption by means of chatwin 1970 s long time asymptotic technique the main contents of this work are i to discuss the five basic characteristics of taylor dispersion ii to analyze the full time evolution of the cross sectional mean concentration distribution with higher order modifications by considering its skewness and kurtosis iii to present the complete two dimensional concentration distribution of the contaminant transport process the effect of bed absorption on the dispersion process is thoroughly discussed 2 method 2 1 formulation for contaminant transport for contaminant transport from a point source release on the free water surface in an open channel flow with bed absorption the right handed cartesian coordinate system ox z is set as shown in fig 1 where the water depth is h x axis is taken to be longitudinal z axis is taken to be vertical and origin o is set at the channel bed wall the convection diffusion equation is 1 c t u z c x d 2 c x 2 2 c z 2 where c x z t is the concentration t is time u z is flow velocity d z is the solute diffusivity for a steady laminar flow in the open channel the transverse velocity profile can be depicted as 2 u z u max z h 2 z h where u max is the maximum velocity on the free water surface consider a point source

the boundary condition at the channel bottom gives 5 d c x 0 t z β c x 0 t where β is the bed absorption parameter since q is finite the upstream and downstream conditions are 6 c z t 0 we use the bracket to denote the mean of a quantity over cross section e g 7 u 1 h 0 h u d z where u is the mean velocity then introducing the following dimensionless parameters 8 x d x u t u h 2 z z h t d h 2 t

diffusion u stands for the velocity deviation from its mean then the governing equation and the initial and boundary conditions are rewritten as 9 c t u c x 2 c pe 2 x 2 2 c z 2 10 c x z 0 δ x δ 1 z 11 c x 1 t z 0 12 c x 0 t z β c x 0 t 13 c x z t 0 we also use the bar to denote the variables related to the cross sectional mean concentration c and 14 c c 2 2 long time asymptotic expansion to deal with above convection diffusion equation we can apply chatwin 1970 s long time asymptotic expansion edgeworth expansion with respect to large time which can obtain the two dimensional concentration distribution as well as the transverse mean concentration distribution firstly we solve the equations of spatial moments of concentration then we obtain the coefficients of edgeworth expansion 2 2 1 moments of concentration and basic characteristic quantities the p th order concentration moment for contaminant transport is defined following the method proposed by aris 1956 15 m p z t x p c x z t d x and moment of cross sectional mean concentration denoted by the bar 16 m p t x p c x t d x applying the definition of concentration moments to eqs 9 12 we can obtain the equations of concentration moments for simplicity the concrete solution process of the concentration moments is given in appendix a to characterize the longitudinal distribution of the cross sectional mean concentration the p th order normalized central moment of mean concentration distribution wang and chen 2017b is introduced as 17 ν p t x x g p c d x c d x where 18 x g t x c d x c d x m 1 m 0 is the centroid position of the cross sectional mean concentration the cross sectional mean concentration central moments at higher orders are expressed as 19 ν 2 t m 2 m 0 x g 2 20 ν 3 t m 3 m 0 3 x g ν 2 x g 3 21 ν 4 t m 4 m 0 4 x g ν 3 6 x g 2 ν 2 x g 4 the zeroth order mean concentration moment reflects the total mass of residual solute in channel the first order mean concentration moment represents the centroid position of the solute cloud and the mean advection velocity can be defined as 22 v g d x g d t the dispersivity associated with the second order mean concentration moment wang and chen 2017a is quantified as 23 d t 1 2 d ν 2 d t furthermore to characterize the spatial transport process of the contaminant the p th order central concentration moment is introduced as yasuda 1984 24 ν p t z x x g p c d x c d

distribution which are basic quantities of probability theory alternative to the moments in statistics cumulants κ n of a probability distribution are similar to moments stuart and ord 2009 chatwin 1972 cumulants can be expressed in terms of moments based on the p order central concentration moments defined in above section the cumulants are presented as 29 κ 1 x g κ 2 ν 2 κ 3 ν 3 κ 4 ν 4 2 ν 2

excess kurtosis γ 2 is a measure of the outliers of a distribution the tail weight and 31 γ 2 κ 4 κ 2 2 the skewness and kurtosis of gaussian distribution are zero since all its cumulants of order 3 and higher are zero therefore these two quantities are often used to measure the deviation from gaussian distribution 2 2 3 edgeworth expansion now we can apply chatwin 1970 s long time asymptotic expansion to obtain the asymptotic solution of concentration distribution chatwin 1970 s technique is actually an edgeworth expansion thus we first introduce gram charlier type a series expansion which has been used in previous studies mehta et al 1974 andersson and berglin 1981 wang and chen 2017a the gram charlier type a series expansion gives the solution of concentration in terms of chebyshev hermite polynomials 32 c x z t m 0 2 π σ exp x x g 2 2 σ 2 n 0 a n z t n σ n he n x x g σ where he n are the hermite polynomials 33 he n x 1 n e x 2 2 d n d x n e x 2 2 n 0 1 2 and the coefficients are 34 a 0 1 a 1 a 2 0 a 3 κ 3 a 4 κ 4 a 5 κ 5 a 6 κ 6 10 κ 3 2 to obtain the real asymptotic expansion we apply the assumption of the long time approximation for cumulants chatwin 1972 35 σ o t 1 2 κ n t o σ 2 n 2 and regroup terms of the same order in σ then use the standardized variable x x x g σ finally the edgeworth s series give 36 c x z t m 0 exp x 2 2 2 π σ 1 κ 3 3 σ 3 he 3 x κ 4 4 σ 4 he 4 x 10 6 κ 3 2 σ 6 he 6 x o σ 3 notice that above asymptotic solution of concentration distribution contains the first fourth order cumulants indeed such solution can reflect the non gaussian effects like skewness and kurtosis chatwin 1972 in addition we can also apply chatwin 1970 s long time asymptotic expansion to obtain the asymptotic solution of transverse mean concentration distribution directly i e 37 c x t m 0 exp x 2 2 2 π σ 1 κ 3 3 σ 3 he 3 x κ 4 4 σ 4 he 4 x 10 6 κ 3 2 σ 6 he 6 x o σ 3 where x is the standardized variable of cross sectional distribution 38 x x x g σ 3 results and discussions 3 1 basic characteristics of taylor dispersion in above section we have defined five basic characteristics of the dispersion process i e exchange rate advection velocity dispersivity skewness and kurtosis wang and chen 2017a 2016b to comprehensively characterize the transport process from a point source release on the free water surface in an open channel flow with bed absorption we discuss the full time evolution of these basic characteristics separately with different values of β 3 1 1 exchange rate the zeroth order moment of the cross sectional mean concentration reflects the mass of retained solute in the flow with no bed absorption the total mass of the solute remains constant with bed absorption the solute decays exponentially with time and will be removed in a shorter time with larger β as shown in fig 2 a similar results can also be found in previous studies wang and chen 2017b a in the case of bed absorption solute depletion near the bed wall on one hand reduces the total mass of the contaminant on the other hand affects the vertical concentration distribution to qualitifiedly analyze the vertical concentration distribution we calculate the mass proportion in the upper half layer from z 0 5 to z 1 which equals 39 1 r m 1 0 0 5 m 0 t z d z m 0 t where r m represents the proportion of solute in the lower half layer from z 0 to z 0 5 to the total solute in the flow the mass proportion in the upper half layer decreases gradually and approaches a steady state at large time as illustrated in fig 2 b for the model of point source release on the water surface in the initial time the contaminant cloud will be immediately carried downstream by the fastest flow at the water surface while at the same time reaches the lower vertical position by molecular diffusion therefore the rate of mass proportion in the upper half layer decreases gradually while with bed absorption that depletes the solute near the wall the contaminant cloud will be concentrated more in the upper layer the larger the β the more the contaminant cloud is concentrated and the earlier the mass proportion reaches its steady state for β 0 notice that r m finally reaches 50 this is because that the contaminant cloud will be diffused into the lower layer under the effect of vertical molecular diffusion which causes the vertical concentration distribution to approach uniformity at large time the results show that for solute dispersion from a point source release in the channel flow without bed absorption the vertical concentration distribution will approach uniformity at large time which is unaffected by the initial condition 3 1 2 advection velocity and dispersivity the first order mean concentration moment represents the centroid position of the cross sectional mean concentration referring to eq 22 the mean advection velocity of the contaminant cloud is illustrated in fig 3 a the mean advection velocity of the contaminant cloud decreases gradually and reaches a steady state at large time the effect of bed absorption causes the mean advection velocity to access the steady state more quickly as mentioned above in the initial stage the contaminant cloud concentrates near the free water surface thus the centroid of solute cloud will be moved at a speed greater than the vertical mean velocity of the flow under the effect of vertical diffusion partial solute diffuses downward into the slower velocity layer thus the mean advection velocity of the contaminant cloud decreases slowly with no bed absorption the mean advection velocity of the contaminant cloud will equal the cross sectional mean velocity of the flow at asymptotic large time corresponding to v g 0 considering the bed absorption the contaminant cloud with slower speed near the bed wall is removed which causes the contaminant cloud to gather in the upper layer which has larger speed therefore the larger the β the mean advection velocity of the solute will be reduced more slowly and reach a steady state more quickly the second order mean concentration moment reflects the dispersivity of the contaminant cloud the temporal evolution of dispersivity defined by eq 23 is shown in fig 3 b the value of dispersivity increases in the initial time and reaches a steady state at large time the effect of bed absorption reduces the value of dispersivity at the steady state in fact the contaminant cloud is diffused under two mechanisms i e nonuniform distribution of the cross sectional velocity and molecular diffusion for the point source release on the free water surface the dispersivity of the contaminant cloud is increased by the vertical diffusion effect in the initial time the bed absorption causes the contaminant cloud to concentrate more in the upper layer while the velocity gradient in the upper layer is lower which contributes less to the dispersivity therefore with the larger β the dispersivity is smaller compared with no bed absorption at the asymptotic steady state 3 1 3 skewness and kurtosis we obtain the skewness and kurtosis of the mean concentration distribution by the cumulants the skewness evaluates the degree of symmetry of the longitudinal concentration distribution while kurtosis is a measure of the outliers of a distribution the tail weight which both approaches zero for the longitudinally asymptotic gaussian distribution wang and chen 2017a previous studies have found that skewness is affected greatly by the different values of bed absorption especially in the earlier stage wang et al 2015 wang and chen 2016b 2017a however for point source release the effect of bed absorption has little impact on the skewness as shown in fig 4 a since the point source release is on the free water surface in the initial time the vertical diffusion is weak and most of the contaminant cloud is concentrated in the upper layer therefore bed absorption has smaller effect on the skewness of the cross sectional mean concentration distribution γ 1 0 indicates that curve of the mean concentration distribution is negatively skewed distribution or left skewed distribution at large time γ 1 0 the mean concentration distribution approaches symmetrical distribution which is unaffected by β the effect of bed absorption decreases the kurtosis of the mean concentration distribution at the initial time at large time kurtosis of the mean concentration distribution is disappeared with γ 2 0 as presented in fig 4 b 3 2 mean concentration distribution we apply chatwin 1970 s long time asymptotic expansion eq 37 to obtain the asymptotic solution of transverse mean concentration distribution the longitudinal distribution of the transverse mean concentration with skewed and peaked modifications is illustrated in fig 5 the effect of bed absorption causes the mean concentration distribution to be more concentrated curve of the mean concentration distribution is more thin and high as presented in fig 5 a in fact when the contaminant is instantaneously released on the free water surface the contaminant is transported downstream quickly at the largest free water surface velocity at the meantime the contaminant is diffused downward under the vertical diffusion effect with bed absorption contaminant depletion near the bed wall causes the contaminant cloud to concentrate more in the upper layer due to the lower velocity gradient in the upper layer the effect of dispersivity is decreased as time processes total mass of the contaminant is decreased exponentially which makes the curves of the mean concentration distribution more flat and approach the x axis at t 2 when β 10 as presented in fig 5 d the mean concentration reaches its longitudinal gaussian distribution at large time which is unaffected by the bed absorption as shown in fig 5 a in the initial stage curve of the mean concentration distribution is asymmetric while at large time the asymmetry is disappeared and the mean concentration distribution with any absorption strength shows an asymptotic gaussian distribution as can be seen in fig 5 d it is noteworthy that the position of the maximum cross sectional mean concentration is biased downstream x 0 actually for the point source release on the water surface the centroid of the contaminant cloud moves downstream at a larger speed than the x axis in the initial time as mentioned in above section a large additional longitudinal displacement for contaminant dispersion will be found at large time as shown in fig 5 d the results here are consistent with previous study fu et al 2016 with the larger β the position of the maximum transverse mean concentration is more rightward which reflects the effect of bed absorption that causes the contaminant cloud to concentrate more in the upper layer and travel with a larger velocity 3 3 two dimensional concentration distribution in above section we have discussed the characteristics of the mean concentration distribution actually the vertical concentration distribution is far from uniform at the initial time especially for the case of point source release on the free water surface with bed absorption discussed in this work the two dimensional concentration distributions of the contaminant cloud are presented in figs 6 and 7 the effect of bed absorption causes the spatial concentration distribution to concentrate more in the upper layer as depicted in fig 6 at the initial time the point source is instantaneously transported downstream by the fastest flow at the water surface at the meantime reaches the lower vertical position by molecular diffusion and travels with a slower speed with bed absorption the solute with a slower velocity near the bed wall is depleted which causes the contaminant to concentrate more in the upper layer confined by the transverse velocity distribution of the open channel flow the dispersivity in the upper layer is decreased by the lower velocity gradient moreover the larger the β the more the spatial concentration distribution is concentrated in the upper layer as shown in fig 6 b c as time processes the vertical diffusion effect causes the vertical concentration distribution to be more uniform as shown in fig 7 a considering the bed absorption the vertical concentration distribution is nonuniform even at large time as depicted in fig 7 b with the large β the total mass of the contaminant cloud decays exponentially and tends to zero at large time as illustrated in fig 7 c the transverse concentration distribution is far from uniform at the initial time as visually presented in fig 6 the cross section at x 0 1 is chosen as an example to quantificationally analyze the vertical concentration distribution as shown in fig 8 a the transverse concentration has a largest value near the free water surface while a lowest value in the bed wall at the initial time as time processes the transverse concentration decreases greatly in the upper layer and approaches uniform distribution at large time as illustrated in fig 8 d the effect of bed absorption can decrease the value of transverse concentration at large time 4 conclusions in this work we have firstly studied the complete two dimensional concentration distribution for a most typical case of a point source release on the free water surface in a channel flow with bed absorption by means of chatwin s long time asymptotic technique the temporal evolutions of the five basic characteristics of taylor dispersion exchange rate advection velocity dispersivity skewness and kurtosis are totally discussed additionally the vertical mean concentration distribution with skewness and kurtosis modifications is also analyzed the effects of bed absorption on the dispersion process are thoroughly evaluated bed absorption on one hand decays the total mass of the retained solute in the flow on the other hand affects the cross sectional and longitudinal concentration distributions with bed absorption the contaminant cloud gather in the upper layer which causes the mean concentration distribution to be more concentrated in the initial time at large time the mean concentration distribution shows a gaussian distribution which is unaffected by the values of β moreover an additional displacement of the position of the maximum transverse mean concentration is revealed the vertical concentration distribution is found to be nonuniform even at large time which demonstrates that the spatial concentration distribution instead of the mean should be explored in the open channel flow with bed absorption for practical implements with strict environmental standards in addition the detailed analytic results can provide practical support for some environmental and industrial applications for example the obtained temporal evolution of two dimensional concentration distribution is essential for environmental risk assessment for a sudden leakage of toxic solute on the free water surface predicting the influenced region and duration is important for environmental protection institutions to take some emergency measures the effect of bed absorption can reduce the total mass of contaminant in the flow in an exponential pattern and decrease the maximum transverse mean concentration quickly which are meaningful for industrial applications such as wastewater treatment engineering and ecological restoration acknowledgments this work is supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant no 51579004 appendix a the equations of concentration moment can be obtained by applying the eq 15 to the eqs 9 12 with the aid of a

a 6 2 χ n z 2 λ n 2 χ n 0 a 7 χ n z β χ n the solution of the eigenvalue problem is cos λ n 1 z where the eigenvalues λ n are the positive roots of the transcendental equation a 8 λ n tan λ n β 0 finally using the integral transform technique the solution of m p z t can be represented by the expansion a 9 m p z t n 1 b pn t χ n z p 0 1 detailed solutions of coefficients b pn t can refer to barton 1983 s work immediately we can obtain moments of cross sectional mean concentration by mean operation a 10 m p t n 1 b pn t χ n z p 0 1 
7279,studying solute dispersion in channel flows is of significance for environmental and industrial applications two dimensional concentration distribution for a most typical case of a point source release on the free water surface in a channel flow with bed absorption is presented by means of chatwin s long time asymptotic technique five basic characteristics of taylor dispersion and vertical mean concentration distribution with skewness and kurtosis modifications are also analyzed the results reveal that bed absorption affects both the longitudinal and vertical concentration distributions and causes the contaminant cloud to concentrate in the upper layer additionally the cross sectional concentration distribution shows an asymptotic gaussian distribution at large time which is unaffected by the bed absorption the vertical concentration distribution is found to be nonuniform even at large time the obtained results are essential for practical implements with strict environmental standards keywords vertical concentration distribution bed absorption point source taylor dispersion open channel flow 1 introduction studying solute dispersion in channel flows is of great significance for environmental and industrial applications such as environmental risk assessment wastewater treatment engineering and ecological restoration fischer 1976 1973 guerrero et al 2010 wu et al 2011 wu and chen 2012 to comprehend the transport process of solute in flows taylor dispersion emerges as a fundamental concept which refers to the process that injected solute spreads under the combined effects of velocity non uniformity and diffusion the long term evolution of transverse mean concentration distribution can be described by a diffusion like model corresponding to a gaussian distribution taylor 1953 1954 the effective diffusivity has been verified by aris s moments analysis aris 1956 and chatwin s long time asymptotic technique chatwin 1970 this classic model has attracted extensive attention and found wide applications davidson and schroter 1983 grotberg et al 1990 sarkar and jayaraman 2002 shankar and lenhoff 1991 yasuda 1984 particularly numerous studies on solute dispersion in open channel flows wang and chen 2016a li et al 2017 ng 2000 ng and yip 2001 wetland flows wang and huai 2018 luo et al 2017 jiang et al 2017 luo et al 2016 chen 2013 tube flows wang et al 2015 ng 2002 wu and chen 2012 or natural rivers wang et al 2017 wang and huai 2016 etc have been conducted among these applications many studies focused on the model of taylor dispersion with bed absorption berkowitz and zhou 1996 berkowitz 2002 wang and chen 2016b which can characterize the ecological effects of the natural water bodies in degrading pollutants dagan 1987 zeng et al 2010 berkowitz 2002 wu et al 2011 for example smith 1983 smith 1986 studied the effect of boundary absorption upon longitudinal dispersion in shear flows mazumder and das 1992 revealed that the dispersion coefficient decreases with the absorption parameter and the increased wall absorption causes negatively skewed deviations from gaussianity mondal and mazumder 2005 presented the longitudinal dispersion of passive tracer molecules released in an incompressible viscous fluid flowing through a channel with reactive walls under the active walls moreover ng 2006 determined the taylor dispersion coefficients in the one dimensional effective diffusion equation for solute dispersion in an open channel flow with boundary reaction nevertheless these studies exclusively focused on the asymptotic mean concentration distribution of the solute transport process and assessment of the absorption effect was simply based on the longitudinal mean concentration berkowitz and zhou 1996 actually the cross sectional concentration distribution is far from uniform at the initial time and even for a long time wu et al 2011 wu and chen 2014a wang et al 2013 2015 wang and chen 2016c moreover the effect of bed absorption further reshapes the vertical concentration distribution to form larger nonuniformity sankarasubramanian and gill 1973 wang and chen 2016b in many practical applications such as environmental risk assessment zeng et al 2014 most concerned indicator is the influenced region where the concentration is beyond some given environmental standards apparently the influenced region is sensitive to the detailed cross sectional concentration distribution rather than the cross sectional mean therefore there remains a need for vertical concentration distribution recent efforts have been undertaken to study the cross sectional or vertical concentration distribution in various flows by different methods to be specific wu and chen 2014b presented explicit solutions for the cross sectional concentration distribution in a pipe flow by perturbation analysis as verified and extended in wang and chen 2016c in terms of the aris gill expansion later wang and chen 2017b illustrated the two dimensional concentration distribution in wetland flow with bulk degradation and bed absorption with the method of concentration moments it is worth noting that wang and chen 2016b studied the vertical concentration distribution for solute dispersion in an open channel flow with bed absorption by extending the aris gill expansion aris 1956 gill 1967 gill and sankarasubramanian 1970 their results verified that there exists a tremendous non uniformity in the vertical concentration distribution however these studies consistently adopted the initial condition of an uniform and instantaneous contaminant release over the cross section of flows for a point source release on the free water surface in a channel flow which is a most practical case in environmental risk assessment as encountered in the leakage of toxic chemicals in waters fischer et al 1979 fu et al 2016 the vertical concentration distribution will be more nonuniform which should be further investigated latini and bernoff 2001 disclosed that there are three regimes for the classical problem of dispersion of a point discharge of tracer in laminar pipe poiseuille flow and only at large times the flow is in the classical taylor regime for which the tracer is homogenized transversely across the pipe and diffuses with a gaussian distribution longitudinally therefore the full time evolution of the concentration distribution of the contaminant transport process from a point source release in a channel flow needs to be studied which is critical to environmental risk assessment wang and chen 2016a in this regard for point source release on the free water surface recently fu et al 2016 have revealed an additional longitudinal displacement for contaminant dispersion in a wetland flow without bed absorption their work focused on the transverse mean concentration distribution at large time in this study efforts will be made to present general solutions by considering the skewness and kurtosis of the concentration distribution in the initial time and analyzing the effect of bed absorption on the dispersion process in this work we theoretically study the contaminant transport from a point source release on the water surface in an open channel flow with bed absorption by means of chatwin 1970 s long time asymptotic technique the main contents of this work are i to discuss the five basic characteristics of taylor dispersion ii to analyze the full time evolution of the cross sectional mean concentration distribution with higher order modifications by considering its skewness and kurtosis iii to present the complete two dimensional concentration distribution of the contaminant transport process the effect of bed absorption on the dispersion process is thoroughly discussed 2 method 2 1 formulation for contaminant transport for contaminant transport from a point source release on the free water surface in an open channel flow with bed absorption the right handed cartesian coordinate system ox z is set as shown in fig 1 where the water depth is h x axis is taken to be longitudinal z axis is taken to be vertical and origin o is set at the channel bed wall the convection diffusion equation is 1 c t u z c x d 2 c x 2 2 c z 2 where c x z t is the concentration t is time u z is flow velocity d z is the solute diffusivity for a steady laminar flow in the open channel the transverse velocity profile can be depicted as 2 u z u max z h 2 z h where u max is the maximum velocity on the free water surface consider a point source

x h t z 0 consider the contaminant absorbed to the substrate is described by the linear first order irreversible absorption ng and yip 2001 berkowitz and zhou 1996 dijk and berkowitz 1998 purnama 1988 the boundary condition at the channel bottom gives 5 d c x 0 t z β c x 0 t where β is the bed absorption parameter since q is finite the upstream and downstream conditions are 6 c z t 0 we use the bracket to denote the mean of a quantity over cross section e g 7 u 1 h 0 h u d z where u is the mean velocity then introducing the following dimensionless parameters 8 x d x u t u h 2 z z h t d h 2 t u u u u pe u h d β β h d c u h 3 d q c where x is the longitudinal coordinate moving with the mean speed of the stream péclet number pe quantifies the relative importance of advection and effective diffusion u stands for the velocity deviation from its mean then the governing equation and the initial and boundary conditions are rewritten as 9 c t u c x 2 c pe 2 x 2 2 c z 2 10 c x z 0 δ x δ 1 z 11 c x 1 t z 0 12 c x 0 t z β c x 0 t 13 c x z t 0 we also use the bar to denote the variables related to the cross sectional mean concentration c and 14 c c 2 2 long time asymptotic expansion to deal with above convection diffusion equation we can apply chatwin 1970 s long time asymptotic expansion edgeworth expansion with respect to large time which can obtain the two dimensional concentration distribution as well as the transverse mean concentration distribution firstly we solve the equations of spatial moments of concentration then we obtain the coefficients of edgeworth expansion 2 2 1 moments of concentration and basic characteristic quantities the p th order concentration moment for contaminant transport is defined following the method proposed by aris 1956 15 m p z t x p c x z t d x and moment of cross sectional mean concentration denoted by the bar 16 m p t x p c x t d x applying the definition of concentration moments to eqs 9 12 we can obtain the equations of concentration moments for simplicity the concrete solution process of the concentration moments is given in appendix a to characterize the longitudinal distribution of the cross sectional mean concentration the p th order normalized central moment of mean concentration distribution wang and chen 2017b is introduced as 17 ν p t x x g p c d x c d x where 18 x g t x c d x c d x m 1 m 0 is the centroid position of the cross sectional mean concentration the cross sectional mean concentration central moments at higher orders are expressed as 19 ν 2 t m 2 m 0 x g 2 20 ν 3 t m 3 m 0 3 x g ν 2 x g 3 21 ν 4 t m 4 m 0 4 x g ν 3 6 x g 2 ν 2 x g 4 the zeroth order mean concentration moment reflects the total mass of residual solute in channel the first order mean concentration moment represents the centroid position of the solute cloud and the mean advection velocity can be defined as 22 v g d x g d t the dispersivity associated with the second order mean concentration moment wang and chen 2017a is quantified as 23 d t 1 2 d ν 2 d t furthermore to characterize the spatial transport process of the contaminant the p th order central concentration moment is introduced as yasuda 1984 24 ν p t z x x g p c d x c d x where 25 x g t z xc d x c d x m 1 m 0 is the longitudinal centroid of the concentration at height z the central moments at higher orders are expressed as 26 ν 2 t z m 2 m 0 x g 2 27 ν 3 t z m 3 m 0 3 x g ν 2 x g 3 28 ν 4 t z m 4 m 0 4 x g ν 3 6 x g 2 ν 2 x g 4 2 2 2 cumulants skewness and kurtosis the coefficients of edgeworth expansion can be obtained through the cumulants of concentration distribution which are basic quantities of probability theory alternative to the moments in statistics cumulants κ n of a probability distribution are similar to moments stuart and ord 2009 chatwin 1972 cumulants can be expressed in terms of moments based on the p order central concentration moments defined in above section the cumulants are presented as 29 κ 1 x g κ 2 ν 2 κ 3 ν 3 κ 4 ν 4 2 ν 2 2 in addition we denote σ κ 2 which is the standard deviation skewness γ 1 a measure of the degree of asymmetry of a distribution to its mean can be defined by cumulants 30 γ 1 κ 3 κ 2 3 2 kurtosis or excess kurtosis γ 2 is a measure of the outliers of a distribution the tail weight and 31 γ 2 κ 4 κ 2 2 the skewness and kurtosis of gaussian distribution are zero since all its cumulants of order 3 and higher are zero therefore these two quantities are often used to measure the deviation from gaussian distribution 2 2 3 edgeworth expansion now we can apply chatwin 1970 s long time asymptotic expansion to obtain the asymptotic solution of concentration distribution chatwin 1970 s technique is actually an edgeworth expansion thus we first introduce gram charlier type a series expansion which has been used in previous studies mehta et al 1974 andersson and berglin 1981 wang and chen 2017a the gram charlier type a series expansion gives the solution of concentration in terms of chebyshev hermite polynomials 32 c x z t m 0 2 π σ exp x x g 2 2 σ 2 n 0 a n z t n σ n he n x x g σ where he n are the hermite polynomials 33 he n x 1 n e x 2 2 d n d x n e x 2 2 n 0 1 2 and the coefficients are 34 a 0 1 a 1 a 2 0 a 3 κ 3 a 4 κ 4 a 5 κ 5 a 6 κ 6 10 κ 3 2 to obtain the real asymptotic expansion we apply the assumption of the long time approximation for cumulants chatwin 1972 35 σ o t 1 2 κ n t o σ 2 n 2 and regroup terms of the same order in σ then use the standardized variable x x x g σ finally the edgeworth s series give 36 c x z t m 0 exp x 2 2 2 π σ 1 κ 3 3 σ 3 he 3 x κ 4 4 σ 4 he 4 x 10 6 κ 3 2 σ 6 he 6 x o σ 3 notice that above asymptotic solution of concentration distribution contains the first fourth order cumulants indeed such solution can reflect the non gaussian effects like skewness and kurtosis chatwin 1972 in addition we can also apply chatwin 1970 s long time asymptotic expansion to obtain the asymptotic solution of transverse mean concentration distribution directly i e 37 c x t m 0 exp x 2 2 2 π σ 1 κ 3 3 σ 3 he 3 x κ 4 4 σ 4 he 4 x 10 6 κ 3 2 σ 6 he 6 x o σ 3 where x is the standardized variable of cross sectional distribution 38 x x x g σ 3 results and discussions 3 1 basic characteristics of taylor dispersion in above section we have defined five basic characteristics of the dispersion process i e exchange rate advection velocity dispersivity skewness and kurtosis wang and chen 2017a 2016b to comprehensively characterize the transport process from a point source release on the free water surface in an open channel flow with bed absorption we discuss the full time evolution of these basic characteristics separately with different values of β 3 1 1 exchange rate the zeroth order moment of the cross sectional mean concentration reflects the mass of retained solute in the flow with no bed absorption the total mass of the solute remains constant with bed absorption the solute decays exponentially with time and will be removed in a shorter time with larger β as shown in fig 2 a similar results can also be found in previous studies wang and chen 2017b a in the case of bed absorption solute depletion near the bed wall on one hand reduces the total mass of the contaminant on the other hand affects the vertical concentration distribution to qualitifiedly analyze the vertical concentration distribution we calculate the mass proportion in the upper half layer from z 0 5 to z 1 which equals 39 1 r m 1 0 0 5 m 0 t z d z m 0 t where r m represents the proportion of solute in the lower half layer from z 0 to z 0 5 to the total solute in the flow the mass proportion in the upper half layer decreases gradually and approaches a steady state at large time as illustrated in fig 2 b for the model of point source release on the water surface in the initial time the contaminant cloud will be immediately carried downstream by the fastest flow at the water surface while at the same time reaches the lower vertical position by molecular diffusion therefore the rate of mass proportion in the upper half layer decreases gradually while with bed absorption that depletes the solute near the wall the contaminant cloud will be concentrated more in the upper layer the larger the β the more the contaminant cloud is concentrated and the earlier the mass proportion reaches its steady state for β 0 notice that r m finally reaches 50 this is because that the contaminant cloud will be diffused into the lower layer under the effect of vertical molecular diffusion which causes the vertical concentration distribution to approach uniformity at large time the results show that for solute dispersion from a point source release in the channel flow without bed absorption the vertical concentration distribution will approach uniformity at large time which is unaffected by the initial condition 3 1 2 advection velocity and dispersivity the first order mean concentration moment represents the centroid position of the cross sectional mean concentration referring to eq 22 the mean advection velocity of the contaminant cloud is illustrated in fig 3 a the mean advection velocity of the contaminant cloud decreases gradually and reaches a steady state at large time the effect of bed absorption causes the mean advection velocity to access the steady state more quickly as mentioned above in the initial stage the contaminant cloud concentrates near the free water surface thus the centroid of solute cloud will be moved at a speed greater than the vertical mean velocity of the flow under the effect of vertical diffusion partial solute diffuses downward into the slower velocity layer thus the mean advection velocity of the contaminant cloud decreases slowly with no bed absorption the mean advection velocity of the contaminant cloud will equal the cross sectional mean velocity of the flow at asymptotic large time corresponding to v g 0 considering the bed absorption the contaminant cloud with slower speed near the bed wall is removed which causes the contaminant cloud to gather in the upper layer which has larger speed therefore the larger the β the mean advection velocity of the solute will be reduced more slowly and reach a steady state more quickly the second order mean concentration moment reflects the dispersivity of the contaminant cloud the temporal evolution of dispersivity defined by eq 23 is shown in fig 3 b the value of dispersivity increases in the initial time and reaches a steady state at large time the effect of bed absorption reduces the value of dispersivity at the steady state in fact the contaminant cloud is diffused under two mechanisms i e nonuniform distribution of the cross sectional velocity and molecular diffusion for the point source release on the free water surface the dispersivity of the contaminant cloud is increased by the vertical diffusion effect in the initial time the bed absorption causes the contaminant cloud to concentrate more in the upper layer while the velocity gradient in the upper layer is lower which contributes less to the dispersivity therefore with the larger β the dispersivity is smaller compared with no bed absorption at the asymptotic steady state 3 1 3 skewness and kurtosis we obtain the skewness and kurtosis of the mean concentration distribution by the cumulants the skewness evaluates the degree of symmetry of the longitudinal concentration distribution while kurtosis is a measure of the outliers of a distribution the tail weight which both approaches zero for the longitudinally asymptotic gaussian distribution wang and chen 2017a previous studies have found that skewness is affected greatly by the different values of bed absorption especially in the earlier stage wang et al 2015 wang and chen 2016b 2017a however for point source release the effect of bed absorption has little impact on the skewness as shown in fig 4 a since the point source release is on the free water surface in the initial time the vertical diffusion is weak and most of the contaminant cloud is concentrated in the upper layer therefore bed absorption has smaller effect on the skewness of the cross sectional mean concentration distribution γ 1 0 indicates that curve of the mean concentration distribution is negatively skewed distribution or left skewed distribution at large time γ 1 0 the mean concentration distribution approaches symmetrical distribution which is unaffected by β the effect of bed absorption decreases the kurtosis of the mean concentration distribution at the initial time at large time kurtosis of the mean concentration distribution is disappeared with γ 2 0 as presented in fig 4 b 3 2 mean concentration distribution we apply chatwin 1970 s long time asymptotic expansion eq 37 to obtain the asymptotic solution of transverse mean concentration distribution the longitudinal distribution of the transverse mean concentration with skewed and peaked modifications is illustrated in fig 5 the effect of bed absorption causes the mean concentration distribution to be more concentrated curve of the mean concentration distribution is more thin and high as presented in fig 5 a in fact when the contaminant is instantaneously released on the free water surface the contaminant is transported downstream quickly at the largest free water surface velocity at the meantime the contaminant is diffused downward under the vertical diffusion effect with bed absorption contaminant depletion near the bed wall causes the contaminant cloud to concentrate more in the upper layer due to the lower velocity gradient in the upper layer the effect of dispersivity is decreased as time processes total mass of the contaminant is decreased exponentially which makes the curves of the mean concentration distribution more flat and approach the x axis at t 2 when β 10 as presented in fig 5 d the mean concentration reaches its longitudinal gaussian distribution at large time which is unaffected by the bed absorption as shown in fig 5 a in the initial stage curve of the mean concentration distribution is asymmetric while at large time the asymmetry is disappeared and the mean concentration distribution with any absorption strength shows an asymptotic gaussian distribution as can be seen in fig 5 d it is noteworthy that the position of the maximum cross sectional mean concentration is biased downstream x 0 actually for the point source release on the water surface the centroid of the contaminant cloud moves downstream at a larger speed than the x axis in the initial time as mentioned in above section a large additional longitudinal displacement for contaminant dispersion will be found at large time as shown in fig 5 d the results here are consistent with previous study fu et al 2016 with the larger β the position of the maximum transverse mean concentration is more rightward which reflects the effect of bed absorption that causes the contaminant cloud to concentrate more in the upper layer and travel with a larger velocity 3 3 two dimensional concentration distribution in above section we have discussed the characteristics of the mean concentration distribution actually the vertical concentration distribution is far from uniform at the initial time especially for the case of point source release on the free water surface with bed absorption discussed in this work the two dimensional concentration distributions of the contaminant cloud are presented in figs 6 and 7 the effect of bed absorption causes the spatial concentration distribution to concentrate more in the upper layer as depicted in fig 6 at the initial time the point source is instantaneously transported downstream by the fastest flow at the water surface at the meantime reaches the lower vertical position by molecular diffusion and travels with a slower speed with bed absorption the solute with a slower velocity near the bed wall is depleted which causes the contaminant to concentrate more in the upper layer confined by the transverse velocity distribution of the open channel flow the dispersivity in the upper layer is decreased by the lower velocity gradient moreover the larger the β the more the spatial concentration distribution is concentrated in the upper layer as shown in fig 6 b c as time processes the vertical diffusion effect causes the vertical concentration distribution to be more uniform as shown in fig 7 a considering the bed absorption the vertical concentration distribution is nonuniform even at large time as depicted in fig 7 b with the large β the total mass of the contaminant cloud decays exponentially and tends to zero at large time as illustrated in fig 7 c the transverse concentration distribution is far from uniform at the initial time as visually presented in fig 6 the cross section at x 0 1 is chosen as an example to quantificationally analyze the vertical concentration distribution as shown in fig 8 a the transverse concentration has a largest value near the free water surface while a lowest value in the bed wall at the initial time as time processes the transverse concentration decreases greatly in the upper layer and approaches uniform distribution at large time as illustrated in fig 8 d the effect of bed absorption can decrease the value of transverse concentration at large time 4 conclusions in this work we have firstly studied the complete two dimensional concentration distribution for a most typical case of a point source release on the free water surface in a channel flow with bed absorption by means of chatwin s long time asymptotic technique the temporal evolutions of the five basic characteristics of taylor dispersion exchange rate advection velocity dispersivity skewness and kurtosis are totally discussed additionally the vertical mean concentration distribution with skewness and kurtosis modifications is also analyzed the effects of bed absorption on the dispersion process are thoroughly evaluated bed absorption on one hand decays the total mass of the retained solute in the flow on the other hand affects the cross sectional and longitudinal concentration distributions with bed absorption the contaminant cloud gather in the upper layer which causes the mean concentration distribution to be more concentrated in the initial time at large time the mean concentration distribution shows a gaussian distribution which is unaffected by the values of β moreover an additional displacement of the position of the maximum transverse mean concentration is revealed the vertical concentration distribution is found to be nonuniform even at large time which demonstrates that the spatial concentration distribution instead of the mean should be explored in the open channel flow with bed absorption for practical implements with strict environmental standards in addition the detailed analytic results can provide practical support for some environmental and industrial applications for example the obtained temporal evolution of two dimensional concentration distribution is essential for environmental risk assessment for a sudden leakage of toxic solute on the free water surface predicting the influenced region and duration is important for environmental protection institutions to take some emergency measures the effect of bed absorption can reduce the total mass of contaminant in the flow in an exponential pattern and decrease the maximum transverse mean concentration quickly which are meaningful for industrial applications such as wastewater treatment engineering and ecological restoration acknowledgments this work is
