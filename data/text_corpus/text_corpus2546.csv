12730,we developed an antibacterial photocatalytic material for purifying drinking water by immobilizing ag nanoislands which exhibit bactericidal activity even under dark conditions on a robust tio2 ceramic photocatalyst designed for underwater use hydrothermal synthesis was used to immobilize ag nanoislands onto the tio2 ceramic this ag tio2 ceramic was treated by ultrasonication for a total of 947 min in water following which the unstably supported ag nanoislands were removed from the tio2 ceramic the ag elution remained below the provisional safety standard limit of 0 1 mg l this ag loaded tio2 ceramic photocatalyst showed significant bactericidal effects even under dark conditions despite the low ag elution this ag loaded tio2 ceramic photocatalyst can probably be used for the photocatalytic sterilization during solar photocatalytic water purification under cloudy or rainy conditions graphical abstract changes of ag nanoislands loaded on tio2 before and after ultrasonic washings unlabelled image keywords titanium dioxide ceramic ag ion elution bactericidal efficiency water sterilization drinking water data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction although the drinking water problem in developing countries is gradually being resolved 2 2 billion people still have no access to safe drinking water 1 consequently the development of technologies for drinking water purification particularly those based on photocatalytic methods must be accelerated this is because this method can be functioned under light irradiation i e only solar energy thus an organic substance present in water may be strongly oxidized using only sunlight and an appropriate photocatalytic surface 2 5 in most developing countries majority of water contaminants are bacteria and organic substances such as pesticides 6 9 the photocatalytic reaction was first reported by fujishima et al in 1972 10 and its mechanism is being investigated in detail to date 11 however the existing photocatalytic materials are not yet suitable for the continuous elimination of these contaminants under natural light source because they cannot operate efficiently under low light conditions e g on cloudy days or at night and this is a major shortcoming to address this limitation we designed a ceramic tio2 photocatalyst with ag nanoislands immobilized on its surface ag was added to endow antibacterial effect to the material via the ag ions ag which act via a well known mechanism 12 19 however the release of ag into water owing to elution must be minimized because it can lead to certain problems one possible concern is the potential impact on health and the other is the potential loss of antibacterial activity resulting from the loss of immobilized ag ag concentrations in natural water sources ranging from undetectable levels to 5 μg l and ag treated water ag concentration sometimes reaches over 50 μg l are not considered significant risks to human health by the who 20 however the who has currently set provisional guidelines for ag in drinking water recommending a maximum ag concentration of 0 1 mg l 20 similarly the united states environmental protection agency usepa guidelines also state that ag concentrations in drinking water should not exceed 0 1 mg l 21 therefore the elution concentration of ag in any ag based water purification system wps should be maintained below 0 1 mg l furthermore the loss of ag from the tio2 surface leads to a loss in the antibacterial activity thus the elution of ag must be low in order to ensure a long service life of the material this is especially important in developing countries where the maintenance of wpss may not always be possible the design of photocatalytic wpss in developing countries should be based on a fixed bed setup because it would be the most affordable in terms of both the initial cost and running cost however photocatalytic materials for fixed bed systems have poor material durability to address this we used a ceramic tio2 photocatalyst 22 as the substrate for ag immobilization this photocatalyst has been previously shown to exhibit high robustness in underwater conditions ag nanoislands have antimicrobial properties as mentioned above and are used as wound dressing materials to prevent wounds from festering 23 24 as dental material in the form of ag loaded zeolite 25 26 for ag coating of medical equipment to provide antimicrobial properties 27 or for drinking water purification 28 furthermore if these ag nanoislands in combination with a photocatalyst that exhibits bactericidal effect upon light irradiation are used for drinking water purification the photocatalytic sterilization can be expected to occur during the day while the bactericidal action will take place at night the most important factor to be considered in the development of this photocatalyst is the elution rate of ag from the catalyst surface we previously studied photocatalysts based on agno3 and ag3po4 which were used as ag sources for controlling the ag elution 29 32 in this study we applied the immobilization methods used for agno3 and agpo4 to immobilize ag ag2o on a ceramic tio2 photocatalyst surface however the interaction between the tio2 surface and the ag nanoislands prepared using this method was not strong enough to prevent ag elution we addressed this problem by subjecting the material to repeated sonication to ag immobilized tio2 ceramics until the amount of ag eluted was 0 1 mg l generally the catalytic activity can be improved by immobilizing noble metal nanoislands on tio2 33 34 repeated ultrasonication is also expected to have a significant influence on the formation of ag nanoislands on tio2 suggesting that the photocatalytic performance of the material should also be monitored during sonication during the photocatalytic reaction changes in ag valence influence the antibacterial performance the impact of this change in the ag valence on the catalytic performance must be studied the repeated ultrasonic treatment can also be used as simulation of the long term use of the photocatalyst that is acceleration test although few studies have shown the effect of the long term use of ag loaded photocatalysts the results of this study are expected to clarify whether photocatalytic materials can withstand long term use in this study we developed a method for immobilizing ag nanoislands on a tio2 ceramic photocatalyst characterized the photocatalyst investigated the elution behavior of ag examined the influence of ag immobilization on the photocatalytic activity and explored the antibacterial activity of the material under dark and uv irradiation conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of ag immobilized tio2 ceramic photocatalyst a highly photocatalytically active tio2 ceramic was obtained from photo catalytic material incorporated psf 01 nagoya japan the detailed preparation method for this catalyst has been described by kato et al 22 the ceramic consisted of 3 5 mm flakes the ceramic mainly comprised the anatase phase anatase rutile 90 10 after calcination at 550 560 c and the specific surface area was approximately 22 m2 g table 1 hno3 agno3 and ag3po4 wako chemical co ltd tokyo japan were used as the dopants for the tio2 ceramics the precursor solution was initially prepared as follows 0 5096 g of silver nitrate agno3 and 0 4186 g of silver orthophosphate ag3po4 were dissolved in 20 ml of 1 m hno3 and 25 g of tio2 ceramic flakes was then added to this nitric acid solution the ti ag molar ratio was approximately 50 1 the solution was then mixed with 84 ml of ethanol 99 5 following which the mixture was placed in a hydrothermal reactor and treated at 120 c for 2 5 h after the treatment the obtained samples were washed with ethanol and centrifuged three times and then dried at 105 c for 15 h although the catalyst was prepared at ti ag ratio of 50 1 the edx results table 1 did not indicate this ratio this is because the ag supported material is a millimeter scale tio2 ceramic and ag is present only on the surface of this ceramic therefore the edx results did not reflect the amount of tio2 inside the tio2 ceramic resulting in a relatively high ag signal intensity 2 2 characterization of photocatalyst x ray diffraction xrd d2 phaser bruker germany was used to analyze the naked tio2 and immobilized ag tio2 ceramics raman spectrometry nrs 4500 jasco tokyo japan was used to determine the crystal structures and field emission scanning electron microscopy energy dispersive x ray spectrometry fe sem edx s 4700 hitachi tokyo japan was used to determine the morphology and elemental composition the specific surface area was measured from the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms belsorp max microtrac bel ag elution from the ag tio2 ceramic was analyzed by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy icp aes icps 7510 shimadzu kyoto japan formic acid concentration was monitored by ion chromatography ic 2001 tosoh tokyo japan to evaluate the photocatalytic activity the elution of ag from the ag tio2 ceramic was analyzed by measuring the concentration of ag in the washings using an ultrasonic washing process ultrasonic cleaner us 4 high frequency power 200 w transmission frequency 38 khz as one corp osaka japan the washing of the ag tio2 ceramic was repeated according to the methodology shown in fig 1 the figure also shows the names of the samples corresponding to different ultrasonic washing times the basic procedure used for the ultrasonic washing of the ag tio2 ceramic was as follows 13 g of fresh ag tio2 ceramic was added to 100 ml of deionized water milliq and treated ultrasonically according to the prescribed time and number of repetitions fig 1 the ag tio2 ceramic mass was equal to that required for filling the photocatalyst tube in the reaction system described in section 2 4 after the ultrasonic washing each ag tio2 ceramic was dried and placed again in 100 ml of water sampling for icp aes analysis was carried out at 0 1 2 3 10 and 24 h after immersion x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps jps 9010tr jeol tokyo japan with mg kα as the x ray source and a hemispherical analyzer as the detector was used to determine the surface elemental composition and chemical state of the obtained catalyst the passage energies for the narrow and wide scans were 10 and 50 ev respectively all the binding energies be were calibrated using the c 1s peak at 284 6 ev the carbon source utilized for the be calibration was an adventitious carbon with a peak of 286 4 ev 35 36 this x ray source was not monochromatized the software named xpspeak41 was employed for the peak fitting analysis 2 3 evaluation of photocatalytic activity the changes in the photocatalytic activity of the ag tio2 ceramic were first analyzed with respect to the washing time in this experiment we used a batch system with 50 ml of 1 10 3 mol l formic acid solution thirteen grams of tio2 or ag tio2 ceramic fig 1 was poured into a 50 ml formic acid solution and irradiated using a 20 w blacklight bulb toshiba tokyo japan changes in the formic acid concentration due to photocatalysis by uv irradiation were observed for 1 5 h by ion chromatography the uv radiation λ 365 nm intensity of the blacklight bulb was 2 mw cm2 as measured using a uv power meter c9356 1 hamamatsu photonics hamamatsu japan 2 4 evaluation of bactericidal efficiency we used escherichia coli e coli k 12 purchased from nbrc culture collection nbrc no 3301 as a model bacterium e coli was streaked on an agar plate nbnacl medium dickinson and company nj usa 0 5 bacto peptone 0 3 beef extract 0 5 nacl 1 5 agar and incubated followed by inoculation into a liquid nbnacl medium dickinson and company 0 5 bacto peptone 0 3 beef extract and 0 5 nacl and incubation at 36 c and 60 rpm for 16 h the e coli growth curve was constructed based on the optical density at 600 nm obtained using a cell density meter co8000 biochrom cambridge uk e coli was incubated until the growth reached a stationary state 5 10 107 cfu ml the incubated e coli was diluted once with phosphate buffered saline and 0 1 ml of the diluted culture was used to inoculate nbnacl and soybean casein digest scd agar 1 5 casein peptone 0 5 soy peptone 0 5 nacl and 1 5 agar 1 5 merck kgaa darmstadt germany in a flat plate culture medium the medium was then incubated at 35 c for 24 h the number of colonies on the medium was counted using a colony counter model 3133 as one corp osaka japan and the average number of colonies was estimated the value corresponding to the culture medium with lower dilution was used when the average viable count per dilution ratio differed by a factor of 2 the bactericidal efficiency of ag on the tio2 ceramic was evaluated using a closed photocatalytic water circulation system fig 2 containing a 500 ml water reservoir the volume of water containing e coli was 250 ml a solenoid driven metering pump with a pump rating of 7 5 l h pw 100 tacmina osaka japan a pyrex glass tube 300 mm length 10 mm i d t 1 mm packed with 13 g of tio2 or ag tio2 ceramic fig 2 b and a 20 w blacklight bulb after passing through a 1 mm long pyrex glass the uv intensity of the blacklight bulb was approximately 2 mw cm2 as measured using a uv power meter in this experiment a saline water solution containing e coli diluted 1 105 times was used the initial concentration of e coli was 6000 cfu ml this value was derived from the reference maximum value of bacteria in drinking water and was determined from the result of our field investigation in thailand 37 initially 250 ml of the solution was circulated through a naked tio2 ceramic or ag tio2 4 13 g packed tube without uv irradiation for 3 h as illustrated in fig 2 this solution was used to investigate the changes of formic acid and e coli concentrations under dark conditions in the next stage the solution was circulated using the two aforementioned types of tubes naked tio2 ceramic and ag tio2 packed ceramic under uv irradiation for 3 h as illustrated in fig 2 the flow rate for photocatalytic sterilization was 7 5 l h the solution was sampled every 30 min and 0 1 ml of each sample was used to inoculate the nbnacl and scd flat plate culture media after the inoculation the medium was incubated for 24 h at 35 c after every 3 h of circulation the circulation system was drained and air dried following which ethanol wako tokyo japan was circulated through the system for 30 min for disinfection ethanol disinfection was repeated and deionized water was then passed not circulated through the system for 2 h after which the system was again drained by blowing air subsequently the system was left to dry overnight under airflow and uv irradiation to eliminate any residual organic compounds or bacteria on the ceramic surface in this experiment the elution level of ag was determined using icp aes 3 results 3 1 ag elution and change in photocatalytic activity after ultrasonic washing the xrd signals fig 3 corresponding to ag0 and ag2o were derived from the ag tio2 0 ceramic 0 denoting the sample before ultrasonic treatment usually the xrd peaks for ag2o at 33 110 38 111 and 55 3 003 originate from the diffraction planes of the cubic phase ag2o jcpds card no 41 1104 38 41 and the peaks at 38 111 44 200 64 220 and 78 311 originate from face centered cubic silver ag0 jcpds card no 04 0738 42 44 the anatase 45 48 rutile 45 49 and brookite 45 46 50 peaks of the base tio2 in the xrd pattern of ag tio2 almost overlapped with the main ag derived peaks owing to the large absolute amounts of tio2 on the other hand both the ag2o 110 peak at 33 and the ag0 311 peak at 78 were independently observed from tio2 peaks as shown in fig 3 clearly confirming the presence of both species on the tio2 surface fig 4 shows the fe sem images of the naked tio2 ceramic surface and immobilized ag tio2 0 as shown in fig 4 a the surface of the tio2 ceramic was very flat i e homogeneous nanoparticles represented the primary morphology of tio2 the fe sem edx analysis revealed that the ag nanoislands on the tio2 ceramic had a diameter of 1 μm fig 4 b the edx analysis fig 4 b clearly revealed that the nanoislands are composed of the oxides of ag together with the xrd analysis it can be concluded that the nanoislands are primarily ag2o thus ag can be immobilized on the surface of the tio2 ceramic by the hydrothermal method because the high photocatalytic activity of the tio2 ceramic is derived from its high surface area care must be taken not to decrease the specific surface area when using the hydrothermal process by measuring the specific surface areas of ag tio2 0 and ag tio2 4 we confirmed that the two materials were approximately the same as the naked and untreated tio2 ceramics indicating that the hydrothermal process scarcely affects the specific surface area the specific surface area and results of the edx analysis are listed in table 1 we then studied the ag elution from the ag tio2 ceramic with respect to the ultrasonic washing time fig 5 the results indicate that the concentration of ag in the elution decreases with increasing sonication owing to the removal of unstable ag from the tio2 surface furthermore the line graphs inside the bar charts in fig 5 show the ag elution concentration over a testing period of 24 h for the ag tio2 0 sample the ag elution concentration was not below 0 1 mg l which is within the recommended who standards over a 24 h period of water testing however the elution rate for ag tio2 4 the most scrupulously washed ag tio2 ceramic was 0 09 mg l within 1 h of testing given that actual photocatalytic water purification occurs in a flow system it is expected that the who ag elution standard will be easily achieved for example if 10 l of water in the ag tio2 4 photocatalytic reactor has a residence time of 10 min the expected ag elution concentration would be 0 0015 mg l tio2 and ag tio2 ceramics were evaluated with respect to their photocatalytic performance the primary purpose of this experiment was to investigate the changes in the physical properties i e durability sterilization and photocatalytic efficiency of the photocatalytic materials due to the continuous use of the ag tio2 ceramic therefore each ultrasonically washed sample was immersed in a 50 ml solution of formic acid 1 10 3 mol l and the photocatalytic activity was evaluated from the concentration of the acid remaining after uv irradiation fig 6 the photocatalytic activities of the initial ag supported samples ag tio2 0 were higher than that of naked tio2 immediately before ag loading this is in agreement with the well known fact that the catalytic activity improves with charge separation when the metal is supported 30 51 56 however when ag tio2 was washed i e ag tio2 1 and the photocatalytic reaction was performed once the catalytic activity decreased to 40 that of naked tio2 on the other hand the photocatalytic activity of the ag tio2 ceramic did not decrease with increasing ultrasonic washing fig 7 therefore two conclusions were drawn from this set of experiments first the amount of ag elution can be minimized by elaborate ultrasonic treatment i e washing of the ag tio2 ceramic except for those easily removed by washing in the first stage second washing does not significantly affect the photocatalytic activity of the ceramic which suggests that the material should be resistant to environmentally stimulated erosion and elution these results are very important because they indicate that the material should be cost effective repeated ultrasonic washing did not significantly reduce the specific surface area of the tio2 ceramic table 1 indicating that the tio2 ceramic is a robust material the elution of ag decreased logarithmically with increasing ultrasonic washing time fig 5 however the mass of ag immobilized on ag tio2 0 was approximately 340 mg and 20 of it was removed from the ag tio2 ceramic during the longest washing procedure i e until ag tio2 4 therefore the total mass of ag eluted from the initial 13 g of the ag tio2 ceramic was 68 mg edx analysis of the tio2 ceramic ag tio2 0 and ag tio2 4 table 1 shows that the elemental ratio of ag in ag tio2 4 decreased by approximately 15 compared with that in the fresh ag tio2 ceramic this value was close to the percentage of ag lost 20 during the longest washing procedure the sem images of ag tio2 4 in fig 8 show the visually observable changes in the surface structure of the ag tio2 ceramic after the longest ultrasonic washing procedure it is clearly suggesting that the relatively large ag nanoislands seen in fig 4 b are hardly present in fig 8 a indicating that repeated ultrasonic washing removes the nanoislands and or leads to their collapse in addition the elemental distribution of ag was not consistent with the oxygen distribution which is different from the results in fig 4 b the highly dispersed component was most likely ag0 51 as shown in fig 8 this result shows that excess ag was removed and that the ag2o nanoislands were reduced to ag0 by repeated ultrasonic washing and photocatalytic reactions the xrd analysis fig 3 inset also confirms this reduction reaction in fact the color of ag2o immobilized on tio2 is thought to be gray 57 and it is expected that the color of ag tio2 0 was reflected in the presence of the ag2o nanoislands the color of ag changes to deep blue almost black upon its reduction from ag to ag0 57 which is very similar to the color of ag tio2 4 fig 2 b fig 9 shows the xrd patterns of the ag tio2 0 and ag tio2 4 samples the ag0 peak of ag tio2 0 as shown in fig 3 did not change after ultrasonic washing however the ag2o 110 peak at 2θ 33 disappeared however not all the ag2o in the nanoislands was converted to ag0 for example the island shown in the lower right of fig 8 a probably slightly remained in the ag2o state because the high brightness distributions of ag and o and p are consistent in the edx image fig 10 a shows the raman spectra of the unmodified tio2 ceramic ag tio2 0 and ag tio2 4 the peaks at 230 and 1055 cm 1 in the raman spectrum of ag tio2 0 are derived from ag o lattice vibration and ag o streching respectively 58 59 the peak at 230 cm 1 was present although with reduced intensity even after many ultrasonic washing cycles and a small quantity of ag2o remained on the tio2 surface in ag tio2 4 on the other hand a new signal appeared at 608 cm 1 after washing as shown in fig 10 a liu et al reported that signals in the vicinity of this peak are derived from the influence of nanocrystalline ag on the raman active vibration modes of rutile tio2 60 61 fig 10 b and c shows the xps spectra of fresh ag immobilized tio2 photocatalyst i e before reaction and ag tio2 4 respectively both the ag0 and ag peaks were observed for the virgin ag immobilized tio2 photocatalyst however the ag peak was not observed in the ag tio2 4 spectrum although ag0 is insoluble in water and does not show sterilization efficiency 62 the oxidation of ag to ag2o initiates the leaching of ag and increases the sterilization efficiency 63 64 owing to the scr effect of ag it is widely utilized as a dopant for enhancing visible light absorption and improving the visible light driven activity of tio2 yu et al developed a novel thin film ag ag2o tio2 photocatalyst for rhodamine b degradation based on xps analysis they concluded the presence of ag0 368 3 and 374 3 ev and ag 367 8 and 373 8 ev in the synthesized catalyst 65 besides similar binding energies of ag0 and ag were reported by liu et al cui et al and mkhalid et al in their published papers 66 68 based on these references the ag 3d xps spectra were fitted to those of ag0 and ag in this study the auger parameter of ag in the catalyst was calculated from the equation α α hν ke c c c be c where ke c c c is the kinetic energy of the auger transition involving electrons from c c and c core levels ke c c c c c for ag m4n45n45 is 350 8 ev 69 be c is the binding energy of the ag species detected by xps analysis the aps of ag in the modified ag tio2 catalyst were calculated at 725 2 ev ag 3d5 2 ag m4n45n45 and 719 2 ev ag 3d5 2 ag m4n45n45 and it was concluded that most of the ag was present in the form of ag0 in good agreement with the result of the ag 3d xps analysis both xps analysis and auger parameters suggest the coexistence of ag0 and ag in the modified catalyst similarly the presence of ag2o was confirmed using raman spectroscopy although the detection sensitivity was low fig 10 a therefore long term antimicrobial performance can be expected for this material 3 2 sterilization efficiency of ag tio2 ceramic against e coli the sterilization efficiencies of the ag tio2 ceramics under dark and uv irradiation conditions were evaluated using a closed circulation system as shown in fig 2 in this experiment change in the e coli population over 3 h of circulation was first investigated in the dark and then under uv irradiation the experiment was repeated by replacing the tio2 ceramic with ag tio2 4 and the results are shown in fig 11 for the tio2 ceramic 50 of e coli was killed after 3 h of circulation without uv irradiation it is highly probable that water was pushed into the tio2 ceramic layer by the diaphragm pump and the resulting pressure generated stressed conditions for the e coli on the other hand the number of the initial e coli of approximately 6000 cfu ml decreased to approximately zero after 1 h of uv irradiation the main difference observed between the dark and uv irradiation conditions was the photocatalytic sterilization efficiency when ag tio2 4 was used under dark conditions the number of e coli decreased to 15 of the initial concentration after 3 h of circulation fig 11 this additional efficiency of the washed and ag immobilized ceramic was three times that of the naked tio2 ceramic operating in the dark thus confirming the sterilization activity of the ceramic supported by ag during the photocatalytic sterilization of e coli using ag tio2 4 the initial concentration of the bacteria was reduced to nearly zero after approximately 3 h of circulation under uv irradiation this photocatalytic sterilization activity was lower than that of the naked tio2 ceramic and was lower than that obtained in the formic acid system however photocatalytic sterilization activity was still present this persistent sterilization activity in the dark is probably the most important aspect of the overall performance of the ag tio2 ceramic characterization of ag immobilized photocatalysts after long term use is rarely performed akhavan reported that the amount of ag eluted with increasing usage significantly decreased in comparison to the elution rate measured during the early stage of operation 70 although it might be worth monitoring the changes in the sterilization efficiency resulting from the elution of ag after long term use of the ceramic akhavan s study 70 suggests that a long time would be required to complete this experiment apart from akhavan s study most other reports describe experiments that use ag supported photocatalysts in the early stages of material preparation thus it is not surprising that they have excellent antimicrobial performance owing to the high ag elution however if ag supported photocatalysts are to be used for drinking water purification the ag elution level must be kept below the recommended standard as reported here extremely severe pretreatment of the ag loaded photocatalysts is necessary to control ag elution at present except for tio2 ceramic there are no photocatalysts that can withstand such pretreatments therefore the ag immobilized tio2 ceramic photocatalyst exhibited low ag elution and reasonable antibacterial activity even in the absence of light 4 conclusions an ag tio2 ceramic in which ag was immobilized on a tio2 ceramic photocatalyst using a hydrothermal method was successfully fabricated the ag elution level of the photocatalyst was decreased to less than the who recommended maximum concentration of 0 1 mg l by applying repeated ultrasonic treatment the photocatalytic activity based on the degradation of formic acid did not decrease significantly by increasing the number of repetitions of the sonication process and the photocatalytic sterilization efficiency was close to that of the naked tio2 ceramic photocatalyst interestingly the ag tio2 ceramic showed bactericidal activity even in the dark under low elution conditions which was not possible with a naked tio2 ceramic photocatalyst the performance satisfies the two crucial requirements for photocatalytic materials intended for the purification of drinking water in developing countries i long term maintenance free disinfection regardless of the weather and illumination conditions and ii low ag elution which does not pose any significant risk to health the widespread use of this material is expected to facilitate access to safe water in developing countries or any other place where such systems may be needed funding this work was supported by scientific research b 19h04310 of the japan society for

tio2 ceramic photocatalyst a highly photocatalytically active tio2 ceramic was obtained from photo catalytic material incorporated psf 01 nagoya japan the detailed preparation method for this catalyst has been described by kato et al 22 the ceramic consisted of 3 5 mm flakes the ceramic mainly comprised the anatase phase anatase rutile 90 10 after calcination at 550 560 c and the specific surface

5096 g of silver nitrate agno3 and 0 4186 g of silver orthophosphate ag3po4 were dissolved in 20 ml of 1 m hno3 and 25 g of tio2 ceramic flakes was then added to this nitric acid solution the ti ag molar ratio was approximately 50 1 the solution was then mixed with 84 ml of ethanol 99 5 following which the mixture was placed in a hydrothermal reactor and treated at 120 c for 2 5 h after the treatment the obtained samples were washed with ethanol and centrifuged three times and then dried at 105 c for 15 h although the catalyst was prepared at ti ag ratio of 50 1 the edx results table 1 did not indicate this ratio this is because the ag supported material is a millimeter scale tio2 ceramic and ag is present only on the surface of this ceramic therefore the edx results did not reflect the amount of tio2 inside the tio2 ceramic resulting in a relatively high ag signal intensity 2 2 characterization of photocatalyst x ray diffraction xrd d2 phaser bruker germany was used to analyze the naked tio2 and immobilized ag tio2 ceramics raman spectrometry nrs 4500 jasco tokyo japan was used to determine the crystal structures and field emission scanning electron microscopy energy

acid concentration was monitored by ion chromatography ic 2001 tosoh tokyo japan to evaluate the photocatalytic activity the elution of ag from the ag tio2 ceramic was analyzed by measuring the

energies for the narrow and wide scans were 10 and 50 ev respectively all the binding energies be were calibrated using the c 1s peak at 284 6 ev the carbon source utilized for the be calibration was an adventitious carbon with a peak of 286 4 ev 35 36 this x ray source was not monochromatized the software named xpspeak41 was employed for the peak fitting analysis 2 3 evaluation of photocatalytic activity the changes in the photocatalytic activity of the ag tio2 ceramic were first analyzed with respect to the washing time in this experiment we used a batch system with 50 ml of 1 10 3 mol l formic acid solution thirteen grams of tio2 or ag tio2 ceramic fig 1 was poured into a 50 ml formic acid solution and irradiated using a 20 w blacklight bulb toshiba tokyo japan changes in the formic acid concentration due to photocatalysis by uv irradiation were observed for 1 5 h by ion chromatography the uv radiation λ 365 nm intensity of the blacklight bulb was 2 mw cm2 as measured using a uv power meter c9356 1 hamamatsu photonics hamamatsu japan 2 4 evaluation of bactericidal efficiency we used escherichia coli e coli k 12 purchased from nbrc culture collection nbrc no 3301 as a model bacterium e coli was streaked on an agar plate nbnacl medium dickinson and company nj usa 0 5 bacto peptone 0 3 beef extract 0 5 nacl 1 5 agar and incubated followed by inoculation into a liquid nbnacl medium dickinson and company 0 5 bacto peptone 0 3 beef extract and 0 5 nacl and incubation at 36 c and 60 rpm for 16 h the e coli growth curve was constructed based on the optical density at 600 nm obtained using a cell density meter co8000 biochrom cambridge uk e coli was incubated until the growth reached a stationary state 5 10 107 cfu ml the incubated e coli was diluted once with phosphate buffered saline and 0 1 ml of the diluted culture was used to inoculate nbnacl and soybean casein digest scd agar 1 5 casein peptone 0 5 soy peptone 0 5 nacl and 1 5 agar 1 5 merck kgaa darmstadt germany in a flat plate culture medium the medium was then incubated at 35 c for 24 h the number of colonies on the medium was counted using a colony counter model 3133 as one corp osaka japan and the average number of colonies was estimated the value corresponding to the culture medium with lower dilution was used when the average viable count per dilution ratio differed by a factor of 2 the bactericidal efficiency of ag on the tio2 ceramic was evaluated using a closed photocatalytic water circulation system fig 2 containing a 500 ml water reservoir the volume of water containing e coli was 250 ml a solenoid driven metering pump with a pump rating of 7 5 l h pw 100 tacmina osaka japan a pyrex glass tube 300 mm length 10 mm i d t 1 mm packed with 13 g of tio2 or ag tio2 ceramic fig 2 b and a 20 w blacklight bulb after passing through a 1 mm long pyrex glass the uv intensity of the blacklight bulb was approximately 2 mw cm2 as measured using a uv power meter in this experiment a saline water solution containing e coli diluted 1 105 times was used the initial concentration of e coli was 6000 cfu ml this value was derived from the reference maximum value of bacteria in drinking water and was determined from the result of our field investigation in thailand 37 initially 250 ml of the solution was circulated through a naked tio2 ceramic or ag tio2 4 13 g packed tube without uv irradiation for 3 h as illustrated in fig 2 this solution was used to investigate the changes of formic acid and e coli concentrations under dark conditions in the next stage the solution was circulated using the two aforementioned types of tubes naked tio2 ceramic and ag tio2 packed ceramic under uv irradiation for 3 h as illustrated in fig 2 the flow rate for photocatalytic sterilization was 7 5 l h the solution was sampled every 30 min and 0 1 ml of each sample was used to inoculate the nbnacl and scd flat plate culture media after the inoculation the medium was incubated for 24 h at 35 c after every 3 h of circulation the circulation system was drained and air dried following which ethanol wako tokyo japan was circulated through the system for 30 min for disinfection ethanol disinfection was repeated and deionized water was then passed not circulated through the system for 2 h after which the system was again drained by blowing air subsequently the system was left to dry overnight under airflow and uv irradiation to eliminate any residual organic compounds or bacteria on the ceramic surface in this experiment the elution level of ag was determined using icp aes 3 results 3 1 ag elution and change in photocatalytic activity after ultrasonic washing the xrd signals fig 3 corresponding to ag0 and ag2o were derived from the ag tio2 0 ceramic 0 denoting the sample before ultrasonic treatment usually the xrd peaks for ag2o at 33 110 38 111 and 55 3 003 originate from the diffraction planes of the cubic phase ag2o jcpds card no 41 1104 38 41 and the peaks at 38 111 44 200 64 220 and 78 311 originate from face centered cubic silver ag0 jcpds card no 04 0738 42 44 the anatase 45 48 rutile 45 49 and brookite 45 46 50 peaks of the base tio2 in the xrd pattern of ag tio2 almost overlapped with the main ag derived peaks owing to the large absolute amounts of tio2 on the other hand both the ag2o 110 peak at 33 and the ag0 311 peak at 78 were independently observed from tio2 peaks as shown in fig 3 clearly confirming the presence of both species on the tio2 surface fig 4 shows the fe sem images of the naked tio2 ceramic surface and immobilized ag tio2 0 as shown in fig 4 a the surface of the tio2 ceramic was very flat i e homogeneous nanoparticles represented the primary morphology of tio2 the fe sem edx analysis revealed that the ag nanoislands on the tio2 ceramic had a diameter of 1 μm fig 4 b the edx analysis fig 4 b clearly revealed that the nanoislands are composed of the oxides of ag together with the xrd analysis it can be concluded that the nanoislands are primarily ag2o thus ag can be immobilized on the surface of the tio2 ceramic by the hydrothermal method because the high photocatalytic activity of the tio2 ceramic is derived from its high surface area care must be taken not to decrease the specific surface area when using the hydrothermal process by measuring the specific surface areas of ag tio2 0 and ag tio2 4 we confirmed that the two materials were approximately the same as the naked and untreated tio2 ceramics indicating that the hydrothermal process scarcely affects the specific surface area the specific surface area and results of the edx analysis are listed in table 1 we then studied the ag elution from the ag tio2 ceramic with respect to the ultrasonic washing time fig 5 the results indicate that the concentration of ag in the elution decreases with increasing sonication owing to the removal of unstable ag from the tio2 surface furthermore the line graphs inside the bar charts in fig 5 show the ag elution concentration over a testing period of 24 h for the ag tio2 0 sample the ag elution concentration was not below 0 1 mg l which is within the recommended who standards over a 24 h period of water testing however the elution rate for ag tio2 4 the most scrupulously washed ag tio2 ceramic was 0 09 mg l within 1 h of testing given that actual photocatalytic water purification occurs in a flow system it is expected that the who ag elution standard will be easily achieved for example if 10 l of water in the ag tio2 4 photocatalytic reactor has a residence time of 10 min the expected ag elution concentration would be 0 0015 mg l tio2 and ag tio2 ceramics were evaluated with respect to their photocatalytic performance the primary purpose of this experiment was to investigate the changes in the physical properties i e durability sterilization and photocatalytic efficiency of the photocatalytic materials due to the continuous use of the ag tio2 ceramic therefore each ultrasonically washed sample was immersed in a 50 ml solution of formic acid 1 10 3 mol l and the photocatalytic activity was evaluated from the concentration of the acid remaining after uv irradiation fig 6 the photocatalytic activities of the initial ag supported samples ag tio2 0 were higher than that of naked tio2 immediately before ag loading this is in agreement with the well known fact that the catalytic activity improves with charge separation when the metal is supported 30 51 56 however when ag tio2 was washed i e ag tio2 1 and the photocatalytic reaction was performed once the catalytic activity decreased to 40 that of naked tio2 on the other hand the photocatalytic activity of the ag tio2 ceramic did not decrease with increasing ultrasonic washing fig 7 therefore two conclusions were drawn from this set of experiments first the amount of ag elution can be minimized by elaborate ultrasonic treatment i e washing of the ag tio2 ceramic except for those easily removed by washing in the first stage second washing does not significantly affect the photocatalytic activity of the ceramic which suggests that the material should be resistant to environmentally stimulated erosion and elution these results are very important because they indicate that the material should be cost effective repeated ultrasonic washing did not significantly reduce the specific surface area of the tio2 ceramic table 1 indicating that the tio2 ceramic is a robust material the elution of ag decreased logarithmically with increasing ultrasonic washing time fig 5 however the mass of ag immobilized on ag tio2 0 was approximately 340 mg and 20 of it was removed from the ag tio2 ceramic during the longest washing procedure i e until ag tio2 4 therefore the total mass of ag eluted from the initial 13 g of the ag tio2 ceramic was 68 mg edx analysis of the tio2 ceramic ag tio2 0 and ag tio2 4 table 1 shows that the elemental ratio of ag in ag tio2 4 decreased by approximately 15 compared with that in the fresh ag tio2 ceramic this value was close to the percentage of ag lost 20 during the longest washing procedure the sem images of ag tio2 4 in fig 8 show the visually observable changes in the surface structure of the ag tio2 ceramic after the longest ultrasonic washing procedure it is clearly suggesting that the relatively large ag nanoislands seen in fig 4 b are hardly present in fig 8 a indicating that repeated ultrasonic washing removes the nanoislands and or leads to their collapse in addition the elemental distribution of ag was not consistent with the oxygen distribution which is different from the results in fig 4 b the highly dispersed component was most likely ag0 51 as shown in fig 8 this result shows that excess ag was removed and that the ag2o nanoislands were reduced to ag0 by repeated ultrasonic washing and photocatalytic reactions the xrd analysis fig 3 inset also confirms this reduction reaction in fact the color of ag2o immobilized on tio2 is thought to be gray 57 and it is expected that the color of ag tio2 0 was reflected in the presence of the ag2o nanoislands the color of ag changes to deep blue almost black upon its reduction from ag to ag0 57 which is very similar to the color of ag tio2 4 fig 2 b fig 9 shows the xrd patterns of the ag tio2 0 and ag tio2 4 samples the ag0 peak of ag tio2 0 as shown in fig 3 did not change after ultrasonic washing however the ag2o 110 peak at 2θ 33 disappeared however not all the ag2o in the nanoislands was converted to ag0 for example the island shown in the lower right of fig 8 a probably slightly remained in the ag2o state because the high brightness distributions of ag and o and p are consistent in the edx image fig 10 a shows the raman spectra of the unmodified tio2 ceramic ag tio2 0 and ag tio2 4 the peaks at 230 and 1055 cm 1 in the raman spectrum of ag tio2 0 are derived from ag o lattice vibration and ag o streching respectively 58 59 the peak at 230 cm 1 was present although with reduced intensity even after many ultrasonic washing cycles and a small quantity of ag2o remained on the tio2 surface in ag tio2 4 on the other hand a new signal appeared at 608 cm 1 after washing as shown in fig 10 a liu et al reported that signals in the vicinity of this peak are derived from the influence of nanocrystalline ag on the raman active vibration modes of rutile tio2 60 61 fig 10 b and c shows the xps spectra of fresh ag immobilized tio2 photocatalyst i e before reaction and ag tio2 4 respectively both the ag0 and ag peaks were observed for the virgin ag immobilized tio2 photocatalyst however the ag peak was not observed in the ag tio2 4 spectrum although ag0 is insoluble in water and does not show sterilization efficiency 62 the oxidation of ag to ag2o initiates the leaching of ag and increases the sterilization efficiency 63 64 owing to the scr effect of ag it is widely utilized as a dopant for enhancing visible light absorption and improving the visible light driven activity of tio2 yu et al developed a novel thin film ag ag2o tio2 photocatalyst for rhodamine b degradation based on xps analysis they concluded the presence of ag0 368 3 and 374 3 ev and ag 367 8 and 373 8 ev in the synthesized catalyst 65 besides similar binding energies of ag0 and ag were reported by liu et al cui et al and mkhalid et al in their published papers 66 68 based on these references the ag 3d xps spectra were fitted to those of ag0 and ag in this study the auger parameter of ag in the catalyst was calculated from the equation α α hν ke c c c be c where ke c c c is the kinetic energy of the auger transition involving electrons from c c and c core levels ke c c c c c for ag m4n45n45 is 350 8 ev 69 be c is the binding energy of the ag species detected by xps analysis the aps of ag in the modified ag tio2 catalyst were calculated at 725 2 ev ag 3d5 2 ag m4n45n45 and 719 2 ev ag 3d5 2 ag m4n45n45 and it was concluded that most of the ag was present in the form of ag0 in good agreement with the result of the ag 3d xps analysis both xps analysis and auger parameters suggest the coexistence of ag0 and ag in the modified catalyst similarly the presence of ag2o was confirmed using raman spectroscopy although the detection sensitivity was low fig 10 a therefore long term antimicrobial performance can be expected for this material 3 2 sterilization efficiency of ag tio2 ceramic against e coli the sterilization efficiencies of the ag tio2 ceramics under dark and uv irradiation conditions were evaluated using a closed circulation system as shown in fig 2 in this experiment change in the e coli population over 3 h of circulation was first investigated in the dark and then under uv irradiation the experiment was repeated by replacing the tio2 ceramic with ag tio2 4 and the results are shown in fig 11 for the tio2 ceramic 50 of e coli was killed after 3 h of circulation without uv irradiation it is highly probable that water was pushed into the tio2 ceramic layer by the diaphragm pump and the resulting pressure generated stressed conditions for the e coli on the other hand the number of the initial e coli of approximately 6000 cfu ml decreased to approximately zero after 1 h of uv irradiation the main difference observed between the dark and uv irradiation conditions was the photocatalytic sterilization efficiency when ag tio2 4 was used under dark conditions the number of e coli decreased to 15 of the initial concentration after 3 h of circulation fig 11 this additional efficiency of the washed and ag immobilized ceramic was three times that of the naked tio2 ceramic operating in the dark thus confirming the sterilization activity of the ceramic supported by ag during the photocatalytic sterilization of e coli using ag tio2 4 the initial concentration of the bacteria was reduced to nearly zero after approximately 3 h of circulation under uv irradiation this photocatalytic sterilization activity was lower than that of the naked tio2 ceramic and was lower than that obtained in the formic acid system however photocatalytic sterilization activity was still present this persistent sterilization activity in the dark is probably the most important aspect of the overall performance of the ag tio2 ceramic characterization of ag immobilized photocatalysts after long term use is rarely performed akhavan reported that the amount of ag eluted with increasing usage significantly decreased in comparison to the elution rate measured during the early stage of operation 70 although it might be worth monitoring the changes in the sterilization efficiency resulting from the elution of ag after long term use of the ceramic akhavan s study 70 suggests that a long time would be required to complete this experiment apart from akhavan s study most other reports describe experiments that use ag supported photocatalysts in the early stages of material preparation thus it is not surprising that they have excellent antimicrobial performance owing to the high ag elution however if ag supported photocatalysts are to be used for drinking water purification the ag elution level must be kept below the recommended standard as reported here extremely severe pretreatment of the ag loaded photocatalysts is necessary to control ag elution at present except for tio2 ceramic there are no photocatalysts that can withstand such pretreatments therefore the ag immobilized tio2 ceramic photocatalyst exhibited low ag elution and reasonable antibacterial activity even in the absence of light 4 conclusions an ag tio2 ceramic in which ag was immobilized on a tio2 ceramic photocatalyst using a hydrothermal method was successfully fabricated the ag elution level of the photocatalyst was decreased to less than the who recommended maximum concentration of 0 1 mg l by applying repeated ultrasonic treatment the photocatalytic activity based on the degradation of formic acid did not decrease significantly by increasing the number of repetitions of the sonication process and the photocatalytic sterilization efficiency was close to that of the naked tio2 ceramic photocatalyst interestingly the ag tio2 ceramic showed bactericidal activity even in the dark under low elution conditions which was not possible with a naked tio2 ceramic photocatalyst the performance satisfies the two crucial requirements for photocatalytic materials intended for the purification of drinking water in developing countries i long term maintenance free disinfection regardless of the weather and illumination conditions and ii low ag elution which does not pose any significant risk to health the widespread use of this material is expected to facilitate access to safe water in developing countries or any other place where such systems may be needed funding this work was supported by scientific research b 19h04310 of the japan society for

12731,in the present work a microwave assisted and secondary roasting preparation process was used to synthesize nanocomposite materials these materials were modified with amorphous cobalt nanoparticles co nps on the surface of biochar doped with different nitrogen sources melamine me 1 10 phenanthroline ph and urea ur the nanocomposite co n c ur with urea as the nitrogen source promoted the generation of mesopores on the surface of carbon materials due to its evaporation during the preparation process thus enhancing the attachment sites of cobalt nanoparticles the co n c ur had a more significant degradation effect on the primary carcinogen sulfamethazine smt by activating peroxymonosulfate pms the degradation rate of smt pollutants was 96 6 within 30 min the optimal reaction conditions were as follows catalyst dosage of 0 4 g l 1 pms dosage of 0 812 mm smt concentration of 10 mg l 1 and ph of 5 67 additionally the co n c ur catalysts possess excellent specific surface area due to the evaporation effect of the calcination process of urea itself compared to other nitrogen source doping electrochemical tests revealed that the composites prepared with urea as the nitrogen source had higher pms induced current density and lowered material impedance values which effectively promoted the catalytic performance of smt degradation concurrently the co n c ur pms reaction system exhibited excellent catalytic performance against other antibiotic organic pollutants subsequently through the capture experiments and electron paramagnetic resonance technical analyses it was determined that the singlet 1o2 played a leading role in the reaction system finally a thorough liquid chromatography mass spectrometry analysis suggested the possible smt degradation pathways thereby providing a new strategy for the subsequent heterogeneous catalysts to degrade persistent organic pollutants graphical abstract amorphous cobalt nanoparticles modified with different nitrogen sources doped biochar materials to activate pms to degrade antibiotic organic pollutants unlabelled image keywords sulfamethazine degradation microwave assisted synthesis peroxymonosulfate activation nitrogen source doped biochar data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction with the continuous improvement in medical standards an increasing number of antibiotic drugs have been used by humans 1 such as sulfamethazine smt which is an essential antibiotic used in sulfa antibacterial agents 2 the molecules of sulfonamide antibiotics include complex structures such as aniline moieties bridged by sulfonamide groups and heterocycles 3 however the traditional treatment process has a slow degradation efficiency and the effect is poor 4 in addition a large number of sulfa antibiotics enter our environment through urine or feces due to incomplete metabolism after consumption hence they are frequently detected in groundwater surface water or soil 5 7 some researchers have pointed out that although the content of antibiotics and antibiotics in water is extremely low their massive discharge and high ecotoxicological risk have a serious impact on the receiving water matrix 8 simultaneously the world health organization s international agency for research on cancer has declared smt to be carcinogenic 9 therefore an efficient and rapid degradation method is urgently required to remove smt in water environments in recent years advanced oxidation process aops based on sulfate radicals so4 has demonstrated potential advantages in degrading organic pollutants that are difficult to degrade in the water environments 10 12 it is mainly manifested in the oxidation reduction potential of so4 e0 2 5 3 1 v which is more than that of the traditional hydroxyl radicals oh e0 1 8 2 7 v and the wide ph application range of the solution 13 15 generally so4 radicals can be produced by stimulating peroxymonosulfate pms or peroxydisulfate pds 16 the molecular system of pms is more accessible to break due to its molecular structure and is widely favored by researchers 17 in addition standard pms activation technologies include light ultrasound metal oxides and transition metal catalytic materials 9 18 20 among the various transition metals cobalt is considered the best activating metal for pms 21 cobalt ions can rapidly combine with pms to produce active species that attack organic pollutants achieving efficient degradation 22 recently the pms activation by biochar catalysts has been extensively recognized to degrade organic pollutants 23 wang et al 24 utilized municipal sludge derived biochar to efficiently degrade triclosan organic pollutants in a persulfate containing system in the absence of biochar the degradation of triclosan did not change significantly thus confirming that biochar can act as an activator of persulfate to enhance catalytic activity biochar materials have an excellent specific surface area for loading cobalt nanoparticles moreover persistent free radicals on the surface of the biochar materials have a strong ability to transfer electrons thereby activating the active species of pms to degrade organic pollutants efficiently 25 26 studies have shown that doping the biochar materials with nitrogen atoms improves the carbon nanomaterials nucleation and redox reaction capabilities 27 simultaneously the doping of nitrogen atoms provides a lone pair of electrons that combines with the π electrons on the carbon material surface for a selective adsorption effect on metal ions 28 29 huang et al 30 used nitrogen doped carbon material loaded with co3o4 as an activator for pms to effectively remove aniline contaminants from water during their study it was found that graphitic nitrogen promoted the electron mobility on the catalyst surface and part of the pyrrole nitrogen could form con coordination bonds with the co species in the catalyst to enhance its catalytic activity subsequently the defects on the calcined nitrogen doped biochar material surface increase thus more edge sites and vacancies are exposed to promote the adhesion of cobalt nanoparticles and facilitate the degradation of smt based on the pms activation 31 at present researchers are still limited to review articles on the effectiveness of co n c materials doped with fixed nitrogen sources in degrading pollutants however there are relatively few studies on the changes in physicochemical properties and performance differences of different typical nitrogen source doped carbon materials loaded with cobalt active species in the conventional synthesis route the reaction time of co n c materials is long the operation process is tedious and the energy consumption is high 32 microwave assisted can reduce the particle size and energy consumption of the reaction process with ultra fast and uniform local temperature increase 33 the secondary roasting can effectively enhance the catalytic performance and stability of cobalt based catalysts this study used a microwave assisted and secondary roasting preparation method to synthesize cobalt nanoparticles co nps the nanoparticles were loaded onto the surface of the biochar materials doped with urea ur melamine me and 1 10 phenanthroline ph as nitrogen sources this composite material activated pms for degrading the sulfa antibiotic smt in an aqueous solution urea as a nitrogen source doped carbon material was found to effectively expand the specific surface area of its material in the catalytic degradation system providing excellent attachment sites for cobalt nanoparticles moreover unlike other nitrogen dopants the urea doped composites possess higher pms response current density and lower electron transfer resistance thus improving the catalytic activity of smt additionally the optimum nitrogen source doping was determined after an in depth investigation of the reaction process operating conditions and application range of different nitrogen source doped composite catalysts the degradation pathway and mechanism of cobalt based nitrogen doped biochar catalysts for activation of pms degradation of smt were further revealed to provide technical and data support for the preparation of nitrogen doped carbon based cobalt based catalysts and their activation for pms degradation of organic matter 2

structural identification co n c me co n c ph and co n c ur exhibited two broad and weak diffraction peaks located at approximately 24 2 110 and 26 4 002 jcpds card no 89 8493 and 41 1487 respectively this observation can be attributed to the low degree of graphitization of the carbon layer and the defective carbon structure 35 36 in addition no prominent diffraction peak of metallic cobalt species was detected in the xrd diagram which could be ascribed to the relatively low cobalt content on the surface of the biochar materials the functional groups on the surface of the three samples were obtained through fourier transform infrared ftir analysis as shown in fig s1b the absorption peak at 3448 cm 1 corresponds to the stretching vibration of the intermolecular oh bond 34 the characteristic infrared peak at 1554 cm 1 corresponds to the cc bond stretching vibration in the material which can enhance the graphitization degree of the composite material and accelerate the transfer efficiency of the carbon material as the medium 37 the characteristic peaks at 1126 cm 1 and 1037 cm 1 are the vibration peaks of the co and co chemical bonds respectively the presence of the co bonds indicates that the sample contains carboxyl groups in addition related reports have confirmed that the co bond is beneficial for promoting the self decomposition process of pms to generate the singlet oxygen 1o2 and further degrade the organic pollutants 38 the absorption peak at 754 cm 1 corresponds to the bending deformation of the aromatic ch the absorption peaks at 683 cm 1 and 523 cm 1 correspond to coo bonds while the absorption peak at 422 cm 1 is ascribed to the con bond 30 39 this phenomenon implies that the material may contain an amorphous co species 40 the morphology and structural characteristics of the samples were obtained by scanning electron microscopy sem analysis fig 1a d fig 1a shows a pure biochar material with a smooth surface and a rich porous three dimensional rod like structure among them the pore size was approximately 1 5 μm this abundant porous carbon material provided an excellent specific surface area for the subsequent doping of the nitrogen and cobalt species in particular when the three composite materials were synthesized the surface and pore diameter of the carbon material became rough and were loaded with many co nps 50 100 nm the carbon skeleton in the overall material was not damaged fig 1b d indicating that the porous material was conducive to a more uniform distribution of nanocomposite materials on its surface in addition high resolution transmission electron microscopy and high angle annular dark field energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds analyses were used as shown in fig 1e loaded amorphous co nps 20 30 nm are observed on the surface of the composite material consistent with the sem results mentioned above according to the energy spectrum data fig 1g c n o p and co were the observed elements in addition the co species are uniformly distributed on the surface of the composites as observed from the eds diagram the samples interface elements and chemical bond structures were analyzed through x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps as shown in fig 2a the complete detection spectra of co n c me co n c ph and co n c ur are composed of c 1 s n 1 s o 1 s p 2p and co 2p elements in addition table s1 supplementary material shows the percentage of the ingredients in the three samples the low co 2p signal in the composite material could be attributed to the porous materials nc me nc ph and nc ur covering the co nps 41 the c 1 s spectra of the three samples contained three subpeaks fig 2b the binding energies near 284 4 ev 285 5 ev and 288 3 ev correspond to sp2 cc co and co 42 confirming the ftir accuracy results the n 1 s spectra were unwound into four subpeaks corresponding to pyridine nx co pyrrole and graphitic fig 2c with their binding energies located near 397 8 ev 399 0 ev 399 9 ev and 401 5 ev respectively previous studies confirmed that the graphitic nitrogen promoted catalytic reactions in contrast the pyridine nitrogen in the material had an excellent adsorption capacity for persulfate 43 44 the o 1 s spectrum and analysis of the xps spectra are shown in fig s2 supplementary materials among them co n c me and co n c ur both contain two sub peaks the binding energy is near 531 1 ev and 532 7 ev corresponding to lattice oxygen and adsorbed oxygen olat and oads the sample co n c ph contains the olat mentioned above and oads sub peaks and the sub peaks of the coo bond its corresponding binding energy is 532 5 ev in addition xps analysis was used to analyze the types of co in co n c me co n c ph and co n c ur as shown in fig 2d the binding energy range for co 2p3 2 co 2p1 2 and co species satellite peaks corresponds to 780 8 781 5 ev 797 2 797 8 ev and 802 6 802 9 ev respectively co 2p3 2 could be unwound into three subpeaks and the corresponding cobalt species were co nx co3 and co2 the appearance of the co nx bond is consistent with the ftir results simultaneously the combination of co ii and nx species promotes the cobalt species deposition and accelerates the pms activation 43 a model diagram of the n2 adsorption desorption isotherm is shown in fig 3a the isotherm models of all the samples conform to the typical iv isotherm a prominent hysteresis loop appears under high pressure p p0 0 47 indicating that the sample catalyst contains a mesoporous structure 45 as shown in table 1 the precursor sample nc ur has a larger specific surface area 1158 8 m2 g 1 than the pure biochar material the average pore size also increased from 2 373 nm pure biochar to 2 406 nm nc ur this observation is attributed to the evaporation of an area during the preparation process of the ur doped biochar material which is beneficial for promoting the mesopore generation on the carbon material surface moreover the nc ur pore volume 0 226 cm3 g 1 is more significant than that of nc me and nc ph thus the nc ur material provides an excellent specific surface area for subsequent composite materials loaded with co nps and facilitates the mass transfer between composite materials thereby promoting their catalytic efficiency in addition the pore volume is calculated by the barrett joyner halenda method via the desorption data and the pore size distribution diagram is presented in s3b supplementary materials 3 2 performance experiment of the composite materials in this study the impact of the loading of amorphous co nps in composite materials on the degradation of target pollutant smt was explored and then amorphous co nps and n cx x is me ph and ur the best ratio of precursors fig s4 supplementary materials shows the effect of different cobalt species loadings in the three composite materials on smt degradation co n c me and co n c ur on smt degradation gradually increased with the increasing cobalt content the enhanced degradation was attributed to the increase in the cobalt species and promoters that stimulate the pms activation accelerating smt pollutant degradation when the loading of cobalt species increased to 15 the degradation efficiency and reaction rate of smt were the highest however when the concentration of the cobalt species increased to 20 the efficiency of co n c me and co n c ur to activate pms decreased this phenomenon is due to the increase in the cobalt species that may lead to a certain degree of masking of the composite material surface consistent with the results obtained by brunauer emmett teller analysis thereby decreasing the mass transfer efficiency of the nitrogen doped carbon materials additionally the smt degradation rate of the activated pms of the co n c ph composite material was proportional to the cobalt species loading therefore we selected a cobalt content of 15 for the subsequent batch experiments in this study for the cost economy and performance effects the co n c me co n c ph and co n c ur composite materials exhibited different catalytic performances for smt degradation in the pms system as shown in fig 3b the smt pollutant degradation and reaction rates of pms alone are 41 7 and 0 0164 min 1 respectively indicating that pms cannot produce active species for degradation without a catalyst 46 the surface adsorption capacities of co n c me co n c ph and co n c ur in a pms free system were explored the corresponding smt removal efficiencies were 72 9 0 0307 min 1 24 3 0 0081 min 1 and 85 2 0 0423 min 1 as a nitrogen source doped carbon material composite material ur demonstrated the best smt removal effect due to its abundance moreover a larger pore size resulted in an excellent specific surface area for doping nevertheless when co n c me co n c ph and co n c ur coexisted in the reaction system with pms the degradation rates of smt reached 89 6 93 3 and 96 2 respectively within 30 min the corresponding reaction rates are shown in fig 3c as 0 0347 0 0465 and 0 0596 min 1 fig s5a c supplementary materials shows the ultraviolet visible spectra of the smt removal by co n c me co n c ph and co n c ur in the pms system two sets of solid absorption peaks were detected in the smt wavelength range of 190 800 nm in this study the absorption peak of 259 nm was optimized to determine the concentration change of the smt as the reaction time progressed the smt pollutants corresponding to 259 nm declined rapidly and tended to be flat thus the results indicated that the active species produced by the reaction system converted the smt pollutants into intermediate products or other small molecular substances fig s6a f shows the different dosages of three composite materials 0 2 0 3 and 0 4 g l 1 influencing smt pollutants degradation effect and reaction rate the degradation effect on smt increased with the increasing catalyst dosage however the composite material co n c ur had a more enhanced removal effect than co n c me and co n c ph under the same conditions the smt degradation rate of the co n c ur pms reaction system was 96 6 0 0612 min 1 while that of co n c me and co n c ph were 95 1 0 0507 min 1 and 94 4 0 0453 min 1 respectively thus different concentrations of pms in the reaction system also influence the degradation rates fig s7a f illustrates the effect of different pms doses on the degradation and reaction rates of smt for the three composite materials the highest smt degradation efficiency was demonstrated by 0 812 mm pms corresponding to the three composite materials the degradation rates were 95 1 94 4 and 95 7 however the three composites smt degradation efficiencies and reaction rates decreased when the concentration was increased to 0 975 mm the decrease was due to the excessive pms concentration which led to a self quenching reaction between so4 and oh 47 therefore the composite material and pms concentrations were selected as 0 4 g l 1 and 0 812 mm respectively for the follow up experiments in this study the ph of the solution in different reaction systems affects the generation of different active substances in pms thus the ph of the reaction system is an essential factor affecting the degradation of smt pollutants by the catalyst it was previously reported that the dissociation coefficient of h2so5 was mainly divided into pka1 0 and pka2 of 9 4 48 therefore the primary form of pms in the solution was so5 2 when the ph range of the solution was between 0 and 9 4 conversely pms existed in the hso5 form when the ph range was more significant than 9 4 42 furthermore fig 4a demonstrates the degradation effect of the three composite materials on smt pollutants at different solution ph values indicating that the acidic conditions have more influence on the degradation effect the smt degradation rates of co n c me co n c ph and co n c ur were 80 9 69 2 and 85 8 respectively conversely alkaline conditions promoted the degradation of smt pollutants when the ph of the solution was 11 the three composite materials had an enhanced degradation effect on smt and their degradation rates were 95 4 96 0 and 97 5 respectively the result is consistent with the results of previous studies 49 in addition the point zero charge phpzc of the composite material was obtained according to the change in ph of the solution before and after the reaction therefore from fig 4b it is concluded that the ph of the composite material is 2 when the ph of the reaction system was higher than 2 the surface of the composite material was negatively charged the existence of pms in the solution is also negatively charged indicating the existence of interactions other than electrostatic between the three composite materials and pms electrochemical techniques such as the i t curve and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis were used to analyze the internal connection to explore the catalytic activity of co n c me co n c ph and co n c ur and pms as shown in fig 4c the currents of the three composite materials and carbon materials rapidly increase with the pms addition in the i t curve test thus the rapid intervention of pms transforms it into an active species additionally the co n c ur composites have a more significant current density 1 08 ma cm 2 than c co n c me and co n c ph with 0 62 1 04 and 1 02 ma cm 2 respectively the higher current density of the co n c ur composite material implied an easy transfer of electrons to the pms surface compared to the other composite materials 50 therefore the co n c ur pms reaction system showed better catalytic activity for degrading smt pollutants the linear sweep voltammetry curve is shown in fig s8 of the supplementary materials and the results obtained are consistent with the i t curve eis was used to analyze the impedance values of the composite materials as shown in fig 4d the ohmic resistance corresponding to the pure carbon material is 124 9 ω the ohmic resistances corresponding to the composite materials co n c me co n c ph and co n c ur were 110 0 115 8 and 100 5 ω respectively therefore the composite material reduces the resistance for transferring an electron to pms resulting in an improved catalytic activity 51 notably the co n c ur has a small ohmic resistance among the three composite materials therefore the co n c ur and pms have a faster electron transfer rate 3 3 effect of water matrix and different pollutants on smt degradation the natural water matrix contains many inorganic anions the presence of such inorganic anions may affect the ineffective decomposition of the free radical species therefore we used two different types of surface water with and without phosphate to prepare the smt solution to explore whether the composite material continued to have an excellent degradation effect on the smt pollutants in natural water as shown in fig 5a no evident inhibition is observed in the degradation of smt pollutants in the surface water using the co n c me pms co n c ph pms and co n c ur pms reaction systems however the reaction system of the different composite materials had an inhibitory effect on the degradation of smt when the surface water solution contained a high phosphate concentration the smt degradation rates were 74 5 59 3 and 79 0 for co n c me co n c ph and co n c ur respectively the free radical species generated in the reaction solution reacted with phosphate and converted into free radical species with weak redox capacity or ineffective decomposition eq 3 thus the smt degradation effect of the composite materials decreased 52 additionally phosphate ions will consume the pms molecules in the catalytic system increasing the competition between the composite material and the pms molecules and also reducing the effect of the catalytic system eq 4 53 3 h 2 po 4 so 4 oh h 2 po 4 so 4 2 oh 4 hso 5 po 4 3 hpo 5 2 so 4 2 additionally different antibiotic contaminants were used to determine the catalytic ability of the three composite materials in the pms reaction system fig 5b shows the degradation effect of co n c me pms co n c ph pms and co n c ur pms on tc smx smt and cap the co n c ur pms reaction system demonstrated a higher degradation effect on all four antibiotic pollutants than other systems however the overall impact of the composite activated pms on the cap degradation was low in all the reaction systems thus the free radicals generated by the composite material by activating pms have a selective degradation effect on some antibiotics and organic pollutants furthermore cycling experiments were conducted to compare the stability and reproducibility of the three composites as shown in fig s9 supplementary material the degradation of smt contaminants by co n c me co n c ph and co n c ur decreased after three cycles to exclude the residues on the surfaces of the three catalysts that were not sufficiently cleaned during the collection process the composites after three cycles were calcined to observe the changes in their catalytic activities as shown in the figure the degradation rates of smt by co n c me co n c ph and co n c ur after calcination increased from 65 6 55 5 and 68 5 to 76 8 58 4 and 76 1 respectively the leaching concentration of co species at different solution ph was detected by combining icp oes method table s2 supplementary material it can be seen from the results that the co n c ur catalyst has the lowest leaching concentration of co ions under different ph conditions when the solution ph was 11 the leaching amount of metal ion co reached 0 49 mg l 1 there is evidence that the leaching of metal ions in the catalyst is mainly caused by hydrogen ions generated during the activation of pms and the leaching of metal ions is also higher at low ph 54 compared with other reports 55 the leaching of part of co species in the catalyst makes the catalytic effect of the composite decrease it is noteworthy that the co n c ur pms system showed better catalytic performance under the same reaction conditions after a series of characterization means and performance experiments for comparison therefore the follow up experiment used a co n c ur composite material to further explore its smt degradation mechanism 3 4 identify the active species free radical capture experiments and electron paramagnetic resonance epr analysis techniques explored the specific active substances in the co n c ur pms reaction system in previous studies it has been proven that it is easier to quench oh 6 0 108 m 1 s 1 with tba in the reaction system than so4 7 6 105 m 1 s 1 methanol can effectively quench both oh 9 7 108 m 1 s 1 and so4 2 5 107 m 1 s 1 in the solution 56 in addition l his is often used as a quencher for 1o2 as shown in fig 6a when methanol is used as a quencher for the reaction solution the smt degradation rate in the co n c ur pms reaction system reduces to 92 2 0 0416 min 1 fig 6b although so4 and oh in the reaction system were inhibited by the quencher to a certain extent they were not the main active species when tba was used as a quencher the smt degradation rate was 81 2 0 0268 min 1 however when l his was used as a quencher the smt degradation had a significant inhibitory effect and its degradation rate plummeted to 36 6 0 0137 min 1 this phenomenon indicates that 1o2 may play a dominant role in degrading smt pollutants in the co n c ur pms reaction system we performed epr technical analysis to prove the above phenomenon further as shown in fig 6c and d 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrrolidine oxide dmpo and 2 2 6 6 tetramethylpiperidine temp is used as quenchants of so4 oh and 1o2 free radicals 57 treatment for 1 min in the reaction system containing dmpo did not show the corresponding characteristic signal peak after the reaction treatment of 3 min weak distinct signal peaks of dmpo oh and dmpo so4 appeared in the epr spectrum 58 thus co n c ur promotes the production of oh and so4 free radicals by activating pms and participating in the smt pollutants degradation moreover several corresponding characteristic signal peaks appeared after 20 min of processing however in the reaction system containing the temp quenchant a solid triple distinct signal peak signal intensity of 1 1 1 appeared before and after treatment 3 and 20 min 38 59 therefore the 1o2 produced in the reaction system reacts with the quenchant temp to produce 2 tetramethyl 4 piperidinyl n oxy in addition the appearance of the characteristic signal peak of this type of active species provides an adequate basis for the smt degradation by the co n c ur pms reaction system 3 5 reaction mechanism combining the above results proposed the catalytic mechanism for smt degradation through the co n c ur pms reaction system as shown in fig 7 phosphoric acid activates the biochar materials while the phosphate groups remaining on the biochar surface have an excellent adsorption effect on the aromatic organic pollutants after washing 60 in the process of free radical degradation co nps loaded on the surface of nc ur materials promote the rapid transfer of electrons by adjusting the high degree of graphitization in carbon materials thereby activating pms to generate free radical active species eqs 5 9 61 however it was determined in the present study that the free radicals generated in the co n c ur pms system had no significant effect on the degradation of the smt pollutants in a previous study pms formed intermediate complexes with biochar materials to effectively combine the pms molecules on the surface of the carbon materials inducing the non free radical degradation path of organic pollutants 62 in the non radical process pms decomposed to produce 1o2 by decomposing the con bond supported on the nc ur surface in contrast the electron transfer between carbon atoms and graphite nitrogen atoms in the nc ur materials led to effective adsorption of pms molecules by the carbon atoms on the surface of the carbon materials 63 this ultrafast electron transfer process promoted the decomposition of pms into so5 active species to produce 1o2 eqs 10 11 in addition several researchers believed that a small amount of co in the catalyst could promote the production of 1o2 from the pms molecules 64 the ftir and xps analysis results also confirmed the presence of a co component in the material finally under the combined action of free radicals and non radical processes the smt molecules degraded into co2 h2o and intermediate products among these non radical processes were dominant 5 hso 5 co 2 so 4 co 3 oh 6 so 4 oh oh so 4 2 7 hso 5 so 4 so 5 hso 4 8 hso 5 oh so 5 h 2 o 9 hso 5 co 3 so 5 co 2 h 10 so 5 h 2 o hso 4 o 1 2 11 hso 5 so 5 hso 4 so 4 2 o 1 2 3 6 possible degradation pathways of smt the co n c ur pms reaction system degraded smt for 30 min having a moderate total organic carbon removal rate thus smt could be transformed into other intermediate products during the degradation of the reaction system 47 therefore liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms analysis was performed to explore the specific intermediate products produced by the smt pollutants in the co n c ur pms reaction system table s3 supplementary materials shows the intermediate products and the product characteristics existing after the degradation of the smt pollutants through the co n c ur pms reaction system as shown in fig 8 smt molecules are divided explicitly into aniline and pyrimidine moieties 65 previous studies have reported that the smt pollutants could nitrify the amino groups on aniline by generating active species 1o2 and so4 radicals to produce p1 m z 308 66 the smt molecule in route 2 could produce p2 m z 295 through the hydroxylation of the active species 9 in route 3 p3 m z 186 was generated through cleavage of the sc bond in the aniline moiety 58 additionally researchers have proved that the sn bond in the smt molecule was not conducive to the attack of active species however the high negative charge of the n atom led to the cleavage of the sn bond to produce p4 m z 175 and p5 m z 123 67 the attack of the so2 of the active species removed p4 producing p6 m z 111 notably p7 m z 105 was generated by the cleavage of the sc bond in the p4 intermediate product in route 5 smt molecules underwent a series of strong oxidation desulfonation and smiles rearrangement reactions at the n s bond in the co n c ur pms reaction system to produce p8 m z 213 this is mainly because the n atom in the dimethylpyrimidine acts as a nucleophile and participates in the intermolecular nucleophilic rearrangement 56 68 p9 m z 227 was obtained by further oxidation of the p8 intermediates 4 conclusions in summary new efficient nanocomposites of nitrogen doped biochar loaded with amorphous co nps co n c me co n c ph and co n c ur were synthesized by secondary calcination simultaneously the composite material was applied to pms to activate and degrade the smt antibiotic organic pollutants the results of characterization techniques and batch performance experiments demonstrated that the composite material doped on the surface of the biochar material with ur as a nitrogen source had enhanced degradation performance in smt than ph and me the degradation rate was 96 6 within 30 min in addition the co n c ur pms reaction system had various solution ph applications and excellent degradation effects against other antibiotic organics tc smx and cap furthermore the epr and capture experiments confirmed 1o2 as the main active species in the co n c ur pms reaction system thus the present study provides novel ideas to construct synthetic nanocomposites for degrading persistent organic pollutants credit authorship

12731,in the present work a microwave assisted and secondary roasting preparation process was used to synthesize nanocomposite materials these materials were modified with amorphous cobalt nanoparticles co nps on the surface of biochar doped with different nitrogen sources melamine me 1 10 phenanthroline ph and urea ur the nanocomposite co n c ur with urea as the nitrogen source promoted the generation of mesopores on the surface of carbon materials due to its evaporation during the preparation process thus enhancing the attachment sites of cobalt nanoparticles the co n c ur had a more significant degradation effect on the primary carcinogen sulfamethazine smt by activating peroxymonosulfate pms the degradation rate of smt pollutants was 96 6 within 30 min the optimal reaction conditions were as follows catalyst dosage of 0 4 g l 1 pms dosage of 0 812 mm smt concentration of 10 mg l 1 and ph of 5 67 additionally the co n c ur catalysts possess excellent specific surface area due to the evaporation effect of the calcination process of urea itself compared to other nitrogen source doping electrochemical tests revealed that the composites prepared with urea as the nitrogen source had higher pms induced current density and lowered material impedance values which effectively promoted the catalytic performance of smt degradation concurrently the co n c ur pms reaction system exhibited excellent catalytic performance against other antibiotic organic pollutants subsequently through the capture experiments and electron paramagnetic resonance technical analyses it was determined that the singlet 1o2 played a leading role in the reaction system finally a thorough liquid chromatography mass spectrometry analysis suggested the possible smt degradation pathways thereby providing a new strategy for the subsequent heterogeneous catalysts to degrade persistent organic pollutants graphical abstract amorphous cobalt nanoparticles modified with different nitrogen sources doped biochar materials to activate pms to degrade antibiotic organic pollutants unlabelled image keywords sulfamethazine degradation microwave assisted synthesis peroxymonosulfate activation nitrogen source doped biochar data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction with the continuous improvement in medical standards an increasing number of antibiotic drugs have been used by humans 1 such as sulfamethazine smt which is an essential antibiotic used in sulfa antibacterial agents 2 the molecules of sulfonamide antibiotics include complex structures such as aniline moieties bridged by sulfonamide groups and heterocycles 3 however the traditional treatment process has a slow degradation efficiency and the effect is poor 4 in addition a large number of sulfa antibiotics enter our environment through urine or feces due to incomplete metabolism after consumption hence they are frequently detected in groundwater surface water or soil 5 7 some researchers have pointed out that although the content of antibiotics and antibiotics in water is extremely low their massive discharge and high ecotoxicological risk have a serious impact on the receiving water matrix 8 simultaneously the world health organization s international agency for research on cancer has declared smt to be carcinogenic 9 therefore an efficient and rapid degradation method is urgently required to remove smt in water environments in recent years advanced oxidation process aops based on sulfate radicals so4 has demonstrated potential advantages in degrading organic pollutants that are difficult to degrade in the water environments 10 12 it is mainly manifested in the oxidation reduction potential of so4 e0 2 5 3 1 v which is more than that of the traditional hydroxyl radicals oh e0 1 8 2 7 v and the wide ph application range of the solution 13 15 generally so4 radicals can be produced by stimulating peroxymonosulfate pms or peroxydisulfate pds 16 the molecular system of pms is more accessible to break due to its molecular structure and is widely favored by researchers 17 in addition standard pms activation technologies include light ultrasound metal oxides and transition metal catalytic materials 9 18 20 among the various transition metals cobalt is considered the best activating metal for pms 21 cobalt ions can rapidly combine with pms to produce active species that attack organic pollutants achieving efficient degradation 22 recently the pms activation by biochar catalysts has been extensively recognized to degrade organic pollutants 23 wang et al 24 utilized municipal sludge derived biochar to efficiently degrade triclosan organic pollutants in a persulfate containing system in the absence of biochar the degradation of triclosan did not change significantly thus confirming that biochar can act as an activator of persulfate to enhance catalytic activity biochar materials have an excellent specific surface area for loading cobalt nanoparticles moreover persistent free radicals on the surface of the biochar materials have a strong ability to transfer electrons thereby activating the active species of pms to degrade organic pollutants efficiently 25 26 studies have shown that doping the biochar materials with nitrogen atoms improves the carbon nanomaterials nucleation and redox reaction capabilities 27 simultaneously the doping of nitrogen atoms provides a lone pair of electrons that combines with the π electrons on the carbon material surface for a selective adsorption effect on metal ions 28 29 huang et al 30 used nitrogen doped carbon material loaded with co3o4 as an activator for pms to effectively remove aniline contaminants from water during their study it was found that graphitic nitrogen promoted the electron mobility on the catalyst surface and part of the pyrrole nitrogen could form con coordination bonds with the co species in the catalyst to enhance its catalytic activity subsequently the defects on the calcined nitrogen doped biochar material surface increase thus more edge sites and vacancies are exposed to promote the adhesion of cobalt nanoparticles and facilitate the degradation of smt based on the pms activation 31 at present researchers are still limited to review articles on the effectiveness of co n c materials doped with fixed nitrogen sources in degrading pollutants however there are relatively few studies on the changes in physicochemical properties and performance differences of different typical nitrogen source doped carbon materials loaded with cobalt active species in the conventional synthesis route the reaction time of co n c materials is long the operation process is tedious and the energy consumption is high 32 microwave assisted can reduce the particle size and energy consumption of the reaction process with ultra fast and uniform local temperature increase 33 the secondary roasting can effectively enhance the catalytic performance and stability of cobalt based catalysts this study used a microwave assisted and secondary roasting preparation method to synthesize cobalt nanoparticles co nps the nanoparticles were loaded onto the surface of the biochar materials doped with urea ur melamine me and 1 10 phenanthroline ph as nitrogen sources this composite material activated pms for degrading the sulfa antibiotic smt in an aqueous solution urea as a nitrogen source doped carbon material was found to effectively expand the specific surface area of its material in the catalytic degradation system providing excellent attachment sites for cobalt nanoparticles moreover unlike other nitrogen dopants the urea doped composites possess higher pms response current density and lower electron transfer resistance thus improving the catalytic activity of smt additionally the optimum nitrogen source doping was determined after an in depth investigation of the reaction process operating conditions and application range of different nitrogen source doped composite catalysts the degradation pathway and mechanism of cobalt based nitrogen doped biochar catalysts for activation of pms degradation of smt were further revealed to provide technical and data support for the preparation of nitrogen doped carbon based cobalt based catalysts and their activation for pms degradation of organic matter 2

subsequently an ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer genesys 50 thermo usa with a wavelength of 259 nm was used to measure the degraded concentration of smt the degradation concentration of smt

and discussion 3 1 characterization of the composite materials fig s1a supplementary materials illustrates the x ray diffraction xrd patterns of the three nitrogen doped carbon materials for their structural identification co n c me co n c ph and co n c ur exhibited two broad and weak diffraction peaks located at approximately 24 2 110 and 26 4 002 jcpds card no 89 8493 and 41 1487 respectively this observation can be attributed to the low degree of graphitization of the carbon layer and the defective carbon structure 35 36 in addition no prominent diffraction peak of metallic cobalt species was detected in the xrd diagram which could be ascribed to the relatively low cobalt content on the surface of the biochar materials the functional groups on the surface of the three samples were obtained through fourier transform infrared ftir analysis as shown in fig s1b the absorption peak at 3448 cm 1 corresponds to the stretching vibration of the intermolecular oh bond 34 the characteristic infrared peak at 1554 cm 1 corresponds to the cc bond stretching vibration in the material which can enhance the graphitization degree of the composite material and accelerate the transfer efficiency of the carbon material as the medium 37 the characteristic peaks at 1126 cm 1 and 1037 cm 1 are the vibration peaks of the co and co chemical bonds respectively the presence of the co bonds indicates that the sample contains carboxyl groups in addition related reports have confirmed that the co bond is beneficial for promoting the self decomposition process of pms to generate the singlet oxygen 1o2 and further degrade the organic pollutants 38 the absorption peak at 754 cm 1 corresponds to the bending deformation of the aromatic ch the absorption peaks at 683 cm 1 and 523 cm 1 correspond to coo bonds while the absorption peak at 422 cm 1 is ascribed to the con bond 30 39 this phenomenon implies that the material may contain an amorphous co species 40 the morphology and structural characteristics of the samples were obtained by scanning electron microscopy sem analysis fig 1a d fig 1a shows a pure biochar material with a smooth surface and a rich porous three dimensional rod like structure among them the pore size was approximately 1 5 μm this abundant porous carbon material provided an excellent specific surface area for the subsequent doping of the nitrogen and cobalt species in particular when the three composite materials were synthesized the surface and pore diameter of the carbon material became rough and were loaded with many co nps 50 100 nm the carbon skeleton in the overall material was not damaged fig 1b d indicating that the porous material was conducive to a more uniform distribution of nanocomposite materials on its surface in addition high resolution transmission electron microscopy and high angle annular dark field energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds analyses were used as shown in fig 1e loaded amorphous co nps 20 30 nm are observed on the surface of the composite material consistent with the sem results mentioned above according to the energy spectrum data fig 1g c n o p and co were the observed elements in addition the co species are uniformly distributed on the surface of the composites as observed from the eds diagram the samples interface elements and chemical bond structures were analyzed through x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps as shown in fig 2a the complete detection spectra of co n c me co n c ph and co n c ur are composed of c 1 s n 1 s o 1 s p 2p and co 2p elements in addition table s1 supplementary material shows the percentage of the ingredients in the three samples the low co 2p signal in the composite material could be attributed to the porous materials nc me nc ph and nc ur covering the co nps 41 the c 1 s spectra of the three samples contained three subpeaks fig 2b the binding energies near 284 4 ev 285 5 ev and 288 3 ev correspond to sp2 cc co and co 42 confirming the ftir accuracy results the n 1 s spectra were unwound into four subpeaks corresponding to pyridine nx co pyrrole and graphitic fig 2c with their binding energies located near 397 8 ev 399 0 ev 399 9 ev and 401 5 ev respectively previous studies confirmed that the graphitic nitrogen promoted catalytic reactions in contrast the pyridine nitrogen in the material had an excellent adsorption capacity for persulfate 43 44 the o 1 s spectrum and analysis of the xps spectra are shown in fig s2 supplementary materials among them co n c me and co n c ur both contain two sub peaks the binding energy is near 531 1 ev and 532 7 ev corresponding to lattice oxygen and adsorbed oxygen olat and oads the sample co n c ph contains the olat mentioned above and oads sub peaks and the sub peaks of the coo bond its corresponding binding energy is 532 5 ev in addition xps analysis was used to analyze the types of co in co n c me co n c ph and co n c ur as shown in fig 2d the binding energy range for co 2p3 2 co 2p1 2 and co species satellite peaks corresponds to 780 8 781 5 ev 797 2 797 8 ev and 802 6 802 9 ev respectively co 2p3 2 could be unwound into three subpeaks and the corresponding cobalt species were co nx co3 and co2 the appearance of the co nx bond is consistent with the ftir results simultaneously the combination of co ii and nx species promotes the cobalt species deposition and accelerates the pms activation 43 a model diagram of the n2 adsorption desorption isotherm is shown in fig 3a the isotherm models of all the samples conform to the typical iv isotherm a prominent hysteresis loop appears under high pressure p p0 0 47 indicating that the sample catalyst contains a mesoporous structure 45 as shown in table 1 the precursor sample nc ur has a larger specific surface area 1158 8 m2 g 1 than the pure biochar material the average pore size also increased from 2 373 nm pure biochar to 2 406 nm nc ur this observation is attributed to the evaporation of an area during the preparation process of the ur doped biochar material which is beneficial for promoting the mesopore generation on the carbon material surface moreover the nc ur pore volume 0 226 cm3 g 1 is more significant than that of nc me and nc ph thus the nc ur material provides an excellent specific surface area for subsequent composite materials loaded with co nps and facilitates the mass transfer between composite materials thereby promoting their catalytic efficiency in addition the pore volume is calculated by the barrett joyner halenda method via the desorption data and the pore size distribution diagram is presented in s3b supplementary materials 3 2 performance experiment of the composite materials in this study the impact of the loading of amorphous co nps in composite materials on the degradation of target pollutant smt was explored and then amorphous co nps and n cx x is me ph and ur the best ratio of precursors fig s4 supplementary materials shows the effect of different cobalt species loadings in the three composite materials on smt degradation co n c me and co n c ur on smt degradation gradually increased with the increasing cobalt content the enhanced degradation was attributed to the increase in the cobalt species and promoters that stimulate the pms activation accelerating smt pollutant degradation when the loading of cobalt species increased to 15 the degradation efficiency and reaction rate of smt were the highest however when the concentration of the cobalt species increased to 20 the efficiency of co n c me and co n c ur to activate pms decreased this phenomenon is due to the increase in the cobalt species that may lead to a certain degree of masking of the composite material surface consistent with the results obtained by brunauer emmett teller analysis thereby decreasing the mass transfer efficiency of the nitrogen doped carbon materials additionally the smt degradation rate of the activated pms of the co n c ph composite material was proportional to the cobalt species loading therefore we selected a cobalt content of 15 for the subsequent batch experiments in this study for the cost economy and performance effects the co n c me co n c ph and co n c ur composite materials exhibited different catalytic performances for smt degradation in the pms system as shown in fig 3b the smt pollutant degradation and reaction rates of pms alone are 41 7 and 0 0164 min 1 respectively indicating that pms cannot produce active species for degradation without a catalyst 46 the surface adsorption capacities of co n c me co n c ph and co n c ur in a pms free system were explored the corresponding smt removal efficiencies were 72 9 0 0307 min 1 24 3 0 0081 min 1 and 85 2 0 0423 min 1 as a nitrogen source doped carbon material composite material ur demonstrated the best smt removal effect due to its abundance moreover a larger pore size resulted in an excellent specific surface area for doping nevertheless when co n c me co n c ph and co n c ur coexisted in the reaction system with pms the degradation rates of smt reached 89 6 93 3 and 96 2 respectively within 30 min the corresponding reaction rates are shown in fig 3c as 0 0347 0 0465 and 0 0596 min 1 fig s5a c supplementary materials shows the ultraviolet visible spectra of the smt removal by co n c me co n c ph and co n c ur in the pms system two sets of solid absorption peaks were detected in the smt wavelength range of 190 800 nm in this study the absorption peak of 259 nm was optimized to determine the concentration change of the smt as the reaction time progressed the smt pollutants corresponding to 259 nm declined rapidly and tended to be flat thus the results indicated that the active species produced by the reaction system converted the smt pollutants into intermediate products or other small molecular substances fig s6a f shows the different dosages of three composite materials 0 2 0 3 and 0 4 g l 1 influencing smt pollutants degradation effect and reaction rate the degradation effect on smt increased with the increasing catalyst dosage however the composite material co n c ur had a more enhanced removal effect than co n c me and co n c ph under the same conditions the smt degradation rate of the co n c ur pms reaction system was 96 6 0 0612 min 1 while that of co n c me and co n c ph were 95 1 0 0507 min 1 and 94 4 0 0453 min 1 respectively thus different concentrations of pms in the reaction system also influence the degradation rates fig s7a f illustrates the effect of different pms doses on the degradation and reaction rates of smt for the three composite materials the highest smt degradation efficiency was demonstrated by 0 812 mm pms corresponding to the three composite materials the degradation rates were 95 1 94 4 and 95 7 however the three composites smt degradation efficiencies and reaction rates decreased when the concentration was increased to 0 975 mm the decrease was due to the excessive pms concentration which led to a self quenching reaction between so4 and oh 47 therefore the composite material and pms concentrations were selected as 0 4 g l 1 and 0 812 mm respectively for the follow up experiments in this study the ph of the solution in different reaction systems affects the generation of different active substances in pms thus the ph of the reaction system is an essential factor affecting the degradation of smt pollutants by the catalyst it was previously reported that the dissociation coefficient of h2so5 was mainly divided into pka1 0 and pka2 of 9 4 48 therefore the primary form of pms in the solution was so5 2 when the ph range of the solution was between 0 and 9 4 conversely pms existed in the hso5 form when the ph range was more significant than 9 4 42 furthermore fig 4a demonstrates the degradation effect of the three composite materials on smt pollutants at different solution ph values indicating that the acidic conditions have more influence on the degradation effect the smt degradation rates of co n c me co n c ph and co n c ur were 80 9 69 2 and 85 8 respectively conversely alkaline conditions promoted the degradation of smt pollutants when the ph of the solution was 11 the three composite materials had an enhanced degradation effect on smt and their degradation rates were 95 4 96 0 and 97 5 respectively the result is consistent with the results of previous studies 49 in addition the point zero charge phpzc of the composite material was obtained according to the change in ph of the solution before and after the reaction therefore from fig 4b it is concluded that the ph of the composite material is 2 when the ph of the reaction system was higher than 2 the surface of the composite material was negatively charged the existence of pms in the solution is also negatively charged indicating the existence of interactions other than electrostatic between the three composite materials and pms electrochemical techniques such as the i t curve and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis were used to analyze the internal connection to explore the catalytic activity of co n c me co n c ph and co n c ur and pms as shown in fig 4c the currents of the three composite materials and carbon materials rapidly increase with the pms addition in the i t curve test thus the rapid intervention of pms transforms it into an active species additionally the co n c ur composites have a more significant current density 1 08 ma cm 2 than c co n c me and co n c ph with 0 62 1 04 and 1 02 ma cm 2 respectively the higher current density of the co n c ur composite material implied an easy transfer of electrons to the pms surface compared to the other composite materials 50 therefore the co n c ur pms reaction system showed better catalytic activity for degrading smt pollutants the linear sweep voltammetry curve is shown in fig s8 of the supplementary materials and the results obtained are consistent with the i t curve eis was used to analyze the impedance values of the composite materials as shown in fig 4d the ohmic resistance corresponding to the pure carbon material is 124 9 ω the ohmic resistances corresponding to the composite materials co n c me co n c ph and co n c ur were 110 0 115 8 and 100 5 ω respectively therefore the composite material reduces the resistance for transferring an electron to pms resulting in an improved catalytic activity 51 notably the co n c ur has a small ohmic resistance among the three composite materials therefore the co n c ur and pms have a faster electron transfer rate 3 3 effect of water matrix and different pollutants on smt degradation the natural water matrix contains many inorganic anions the presence of such inorganic anions may affect the ineffective decomposition of the free radical species therefore we used two different types of surface water with and without phosphate to prepare the smt solution to explore whether the composite material continued to have an excellent degradation effect on the smt pollutants in natural water as shown in fig 5a no evident inhibition is observed in the degradation of smt pollutants in the surface water using the co n c me pms co n c ph pms and co n c ur pms reaction systems however the reaction system of the different composite materials had an inhibitory effect on the degradation of smt when the surface water solution contained a high phosphate concentration the smt degradation rates were 74 5 59 3 and 79 0 for co n c me co n c ph and co n c ur respectively the free radical species generated in the reaction solution reacted with phosphate and converted into free radical species with weak redox capacity or ineffective decomposition eq 3 thus the smt degradation effect of the composite materials decreased 52 additionally phosphate ions will consume the pms molecules in the catalytic system increasing the competition between the composite material and the pms molecules and also reducing the effect of the catalytic system eq 4 53 3 h 2 po 4 so 4 oh h 2 po 4 so 4 2 oh 4 hso 5 po 4 3 hpo 5 2 so 4 2 additionally different antibiotic contaminants were used to determine the catalytic ability of the three composite materials in the pms reaction system fig 5b shows the degradation effect of co n c me pms co n c ph pms and co n c ur pms on tc smx smt and cap the co n c ur pms reaction system demonstrated a higher degradation effect on all four antibiotic pollutants than other systems however the overall impact of the composite activated pms on the cap degradation was low in all the reaction systems thus the free radicals generated by the composite material by activating pms have a selective degradation effect on some antibiotics and organic pollutants furthermore cycling experiments were conducted to compare the stability and reproducibility of the three composites as shown in fig s9 supplementary material the degradation of smt contaminants by co n c me co n c ph and co n c ur decreased after three cycles to exclude the residues on the surfaces of the three catalysts that were not sufficiently cleaned during the collection process the composites after three cycles were calcined to observe the changes in their catalytic activities as shown in the figure the degradation rates of smt by co n c me co n c ph and co n c ur after calcination increased from 65 6 55 5 and 68 5 to 76 8 58 4 and 76 1 respectively the leaching concentration of co species at different solution ph was detected by combining icp oes method table s2 supplementary material it can be seen from the results that the co n c ur catalyst has the lowest leaching concentration of co ions under different ph conditions when the solution ph was 11 the leaching amount of metal ion co reached 0 49 mg l 1 there is evidence that the leaching of metal ions in the catalyst is mainly caused by hydrogen ions generated during the activation of pms and the leaching of metal ions is also higher at low ph 54 compared with other reports 55 the leaching of part of co species in the catalyst makes the catalytic effect of the composite decrease it is noteworthy that the co n c ur pms system showed better catalytic performance under the same reaction conditions after a series of characterization means and performance experiments for comparison therefore the follow up experiment used a co n c ur composite material to further explore its smt degradation mechanism 3 4 identify the active species free radical capture experiments and electron paramagnetic resonance epr analysis techniques explored the specific active substances in the co n c ur pms reaction system in previous studies it has been proven that it is easier to quench oh 6 0 108 m 1 s 1 with tba in the reaction system than so4 7 6 105 m 1 s 1 methanol can effectively quench both oh 9 7 108 m 1 s 1 and so4 2 5 107 m 1 s 1 in the solution 56 in addition l his is often used as a quencher for 1o2 as shown in fig 6a when methanol is used as a quencher for the reaction solution the smt degradation rate in the co n c ur pms reaction system reduces to 92 2 0 0416 min 1 fig 6b although so4 and oh in the reaction system were inhibited by the quencher to a certain extent they were not the main active species when tba was used as a quencher the smt degradation rate was 81 2 0 0268 min 1 however when l his was used as a quencher the smt degradation had a significant inhibitory effect and its degradation rate plummeted to 36 6 0 0137 min 1 this phenomenon indicates that 1o2 may play a dominant role in degrading smt pollutants in the co n c ur pms reaction system we performed epr technical analysis to prove the above phenomenon further as shown in fig 6c and d 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrrolidine oxide dmpo and 2 2 6 6 tetramethylpiperidine temp is used as quenchants of so4 oh and 1o2 free radicals 57 treatment for 1 min in the reaction system containing dmpo did not show the corresponding characteristic signal peak after the reaction treatment of 3 min weak distinct signal peaks of dmpo oh and dmpo so4 appeared in the epr spectrum 58 thus co n c ur promotes the production of oh and so4 free radicals by activating pms and participating in the smt pollutants degradation moreover several corresponding characteristic signal peaks appeared after 20 min of processing however in the reaction system containing the temp quenchant a solid triple distinct signal peak signal intensity of 1 1 1 appeared before and after treatment 3 and 20 min 38 59 therefore the 1o2 produced in the reaction system reacts with the quenchant temp to produce 2 tetramethyl 4 piperidinyl n oxy in addition the appearance of the characteristic signal peak of this type of active species provides an adequate basis for the smt degradation by the co n c ur pms reaction system 3 5 reaction mechanism combining the above results proposed the catalytic mechanism for smt degradation through the co n c ur pms reaction system as shown in fig 7 phosphoric acid activates the biochar materials while the phosphate groups remaining on the biochar surface have an excellent adsorption effect on the aromatic organic pollutants after washing 60 in the process of free radical degradation co nps loaded on the surface of nc ur materials promote the rapid transfer of electrons by adjusting the high degree of graphitization in carbon materials thereby activating pms to generate free radical active species eqs 5 9 61 however it was determined in the present study that the free radicals generated in the co n c ur pms system had no significant effect on the degradation of the smt pollutants in a previous study pms formed intermediate complexes with biochar materials to effectively combine the pms molecules on the surface of the carbon materials inducing the non free radical degradation path of organic pollutants 62 in the non radical process pms decomposed to produce 1o2 by decomposing the con bond supported on the nc ur surface in contrast the electron transfer between carbon atoms and graphite nitrogen atoms in the nc ur materials led to effective adsorption of pms molecules by the carbon atoms on the surface of the carbon materials 63 this ultrafast electron transfer process promoted the decomposition of pms into so5 active species to produce 1o2 eqs 10 11 in addition several researchers believed that a small amount of co in the catalyst could promote the production of 1o2 from the pms molecules 64 the ftir and xps analysis results also confirmed the presence of a co component in the material finally under the combined action of free radicals and non radical processes the smt molecules degraded into co2 h2o and intermediate products among these non radical processes were dominant 5 hso 5 co 2 so 4 co 3 oh 6 so 4 oh oh so 4 2 7 hso 5 so 4 so 5 hso 4 8 hso 5 oh so 5 h 2 o 9 hso 5 co 3 so 5 co 2 h 10 so 5 h 2 o hso 4 o 1 2 11 hso 5 so 5 hso 4 so 4 2 o 1 2 3 6 possible degradation pathways of smt the co n c ur pms reaction system degraded smt for 30 min having a moderate total organic carbon removal rate thus smt could be transformed into other intermediate products during the degradation of the reaction system 47 therefore liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms analysis was performed to explore the specific intermediate products produced by the smt pollutants in the co n c ur pms reaction system table s3 supplementary materials shows the intermediate products and the product characteristics existing after the degradation of the smt pollutants through the co n c ur pms reaction system as shown in fig 8 smt molecules are divided explicitly into aniline and pyrimidine moieties 65 previous studies have reported that the smt pollutants could nitrify the amino groups on aniline by generating active species 1o2 and so4 radicals to produce p1 m z 308 66 the smt molecule in route 2 could produce p2 m z 295 through the hydroxylation of the active species 9 in route 3 p3 m z 186 was generated through cleavage of the sc bond in the aniline moiety 58 additionally researchers have proved that the sn bond in the smt molecule was not conducive to the attack of active species however the high negative charge of the n atom led to the cleavage of the sn bond to produce p4 m z 175 and p5 m z 123 67 the attack of the so2 of the active species removed p4 producing p6 m z 111 notably p7 m z 105 was generated by the cleavage of the sc bond in the p4 intermediate product in route 5 smt molecules underwent a series of strong oxidation desulfonation and smiles rearrangement reactions at the n s bond in the co n c ur pms reaction system to produce p8 m z 213 this is mainly because the n atom in the dimethylpyrimidine acts as a nucleophile and participates in the intermolecular nucleophilic rearrangement 56 68 p9 m z 227 was obtained by further oxidation of the p8 intermediates 4 conclusions in summary new efficient nanocomposites of nitrogen doped biochar loaded with amorphous co nps co n c me co n c ph and co n c ur were synthesized by secondary calcination simultaneously the composite material was applied to pms to activate and degrade the smt antibiotic organic pollutants the results of characterization techniques and batch performance experiments demonstrated that the composite material doped on the surface of the biochar material with ur as a nitrogen source had enhanced degradation performance in smt than ph and me the degradation rate was 96 6 within 30 min in addition the co n c ur pms reaction system had various solution ph applications and excellent degradation effects against other antibiotic organics tc smx and cap furthermore the epr and capture experiments confirmed 1o2 as the main active species in the co n c ur pms reaction system thus the present study provides novel ideas to construct synthetic nanocomposites for degrading persistent organic pollutants credit authorship

dyes under both anaerobic and aerobic conditions 12 13 in general azo dyes cannot easily be degraded in the presence of oxygen by bacteria however under anaerobic conditions dyes can be degraded by various microorganisms into their corresponding aromatic amines which are further degraded in the presence of oxygen 6 14 studies have shown that microalgae can be used to treat azo dye wastewater under aerobic conditions mahalakshmi et al 15 used green and blue green algae to decolor 10 ppm of congo red dye crd with a maximum decolorization rate of 98 hernández zamora et al 16 assayed the ability of chlorella vulgaris to remove crd from aqueous solutions and obtained a dye removal rate of 58 at a concentration of 25 mg l the dye concentrations used in previous studies were lower than those present in the actual wastewater the transmittance of the dye solution decreased with increasing dye concentration if a microalgal suspension system is used to remove a high dye concentration low light transmittance inhibits the algal growth and leads to death as previously reported the color level of actual textile wastewater was as high as 1300 1000 17 algal adsorption has previously been used to remove high concentrations of dyes rotating algal biofilm rab has been developed for the cultivation of immobilized algal biofilm systems to overcome the problem of poor light transmittance in traditional suspended culture systems 18 the rab system relies on a vertical belt on which algae and bacteria attach to extracellular polymers for growth and biofilm formation biofilms absorb nutrients from wastewater and are rotated out of the water for exposure to sunlight absorption of co2 and exchange of co2 and o2 while simultaneously breaking down organic matter adsorbed on the biofilm surface rab reactors enable a larger surface area to be exposed to sunlight and can produce 5 10 times more biomass than traditional suspension systems many species of bacteria and eukaryotes such as proteobacteria cyanobacteria ascomycetes and chlorophyta can live and form stable biofilms 19 the increase in the algal biofilm thickness affects the mass transfer and light transmittivity of the gas forming co2 and o2 gradients on the carrier surface this results in the formation of anaerobic micro oxygen aerobic and light aerobic zones from the base upward providing suitable conditions for the survival of microorganisms with different physiological characteristics consequently the attached algal biofilms had a rich community structure this approach has been successfully used to remove high concentrations of nickel ions nutrients and metals from the concentrated sludge supernatant of municipal sewage treatment plants polyacrylamides from petroleum wastewater and other wastewaters with poor biodegradability achieving excellent results 19 20 in previous studies the color levels of wastewater that can be treated in rab were very low for azo dye wastewater low concentrations can produce very high color values high color values represent poor light transmittance which affects the growth of algae and other microorganisms therefore it is very necessary to study the feasibility of rab treatment of high color dye wastewater theoretically while treating highly concentrated dye wastewater with rab sufficient light intensity can be obtained when the algal biofilm is rotated into the air therefore the low light transmittance of highly concentrated dye wastewater does not affect the microalgae growth which can effectively degrade the dyes moreover different oxygen containing regions were formed within the biofilm this study aimed to explore the feasibility of using an rab system to improve the treatment of wastewater with high dye concentrations investigate the effects of ph and sulfate concentration on the dye degradation efficiency and evaluate the roles of bacteria and eukaryotic taxa in the dye removal process 2 materials

for experiments 2 3 rab assembly and operation a part of the lab scale rab reactor was a semicircular tank containing wastewater at a volume of 1 0 l 19 the biofilm carrier was a canvas 15 60 cm with an effective adhesion area of 870 cm2 and a rotational speed of 10 rpm motor power of 10 w the rab reactors were started by inoculating the algal culture into the tank and rotating the rab belt every three days the used algal solution was replaced with fresh algae solution od 1 0 in the tank approximately 200 ml of water was added to the reservoir every 24 h to compensate for the water loss owing to evaporation the rab reactors were operated under 24 h of exposure to light 130 μmol m 2 s 1 it took two weeks for suspended algae gradually attached to the surface of the belt and formed a stable algal biofilm with a thickness of 1 2 mm the algal biofilm was then acclimated using simulated dye wastewater bbm solution without nitrate with ao 2 at a concentration of 50 to 100 mg l the wastewater was changed every 24 h and the algal biofilm was scraped every 7 days the experimental stage began after 28 days two sets of devices were used for parallel testing to account for evaporation deionized

fluid of biofilm was prepared as chan et al 22 decreased the biofilm was broken using the bead crushing method using deionized water as the solvent the ratio of algal volume ml to the grinding bead

to obtain an average particle size of approximately 2 μm a sample sheet was obtained by pressing the sheet at 20 mpa for 1 min after scanning by fourier infrared spectrometry the corresponding infrared spectra were obtained and the spectral profiles obtained by scanning were identified and compared with those of the standard spectral library 2 6 microbial diversity measurement 2 6 1 dna

database project rdp and greengene databases were used for the comparison fgr and rdp were used for the functional gene analysis based on the genbank functional gene database the qiime platform was used with a confidence threshold of 0 7 for the rdp classifier 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation effect and products 3 1 1 degradation effect different concentrations of ao 2 50 600 mg l were injected into the reactor as shown in fig 1 by adjusting the hrt the degradation efficiency of the rab exceeded 95 the degradation efficiencies at 200 and 600 mg l were 97 3 2 2 and 98 25 0 04 respectively the highest removal rate was 592 35 mg l d for 600 mg l a comparison of the pollutant removal performance with those of previous studies is provided in table 1 the degradation efficiencies obtained in this study were much higher than those of previously reported suspension systems and other biosystems table 1 biofilms could grow with ao 2 as the only n source in the influent indicating that the microorganisms in the biofilm were capable of decomposing and growing azo dyes these results indicate that the rab reactor has a good tolerance and the microorganisms in it can efficiently break the azo bond of ao 2 and efficiently capture and utilize the resulting n the symbiotic effects of bacteria and algae on the rupture of azo bonds absorption efficiency and utilization of nitrogen sources were greater than those of the single population treatment of dye wastewater 3 1 2 analysis of ao 2 degradation products we studied the variation in the degradation products of the dye in the rab by uv scanning of the effluent at different time points the uv absorption spectra are important indicators of the decolorization and degradation of azo dyes fig 2 shows that the characteristic absorption peak 484 nm of ao 2 gradually decreases as the operation time increases the degradation efficiencies of ao 2 reached 75 19 and 97 38 after 3 and 6 h respectively these results indicate that ao 2 can be effectively degraded in the rab reactor and the degradation efficiency was consistent with the results shown in fig 1 fig 2b shows the ft ir characteristics of the incoming and outgoing water samples from the rab system the main degradation products of ao 2 were amines 3407 nm and olefins 1663 nm most bacteria fracture azo bonds under anaerobic conditions however dyes cannot easily be degraded under aerobic conditions 24 25 in contrast the mechanism underlying the degradation of azo dyes by cyanobacteria differs from that by bacteria azo dyes are degraded by cyanobacteria mainly by laccase and azo reductase and the azo bond is degraded into ammonia nitrogen which is then absorbed and utilized the rab mainly operated under aerobic conditions and the dye removal effect was obvious indicating that cyanobacteria were vital components of the rab reactors the initial degradation of azo dyes into aromatic amines is known to be a key step in decolorization the complete mineralization of toxic aromatic amines into environmental substances is the last link in the degradation process of azo dyes and determines whether the dye wastewater can be discharged after treatment 3 2 effect of ph and sulfate 3 2 1 effect of ph the effect of ph was evaluated by feeding the reactors with 100 mg l of ao 2 at ph values of 5 7 and 9 for 16 cycles as shown in fig 3 the degradation efficiency of ao 2 decreased from 98 5 0 3 to 96 7 1 1 when the ph of wastewater changed from acidic to alkaline fig 3a and the differences among ph values were significant p 0 001 furthermore as shown in fig 3 b when the initial ph values of dye wastewater were 5 0 and 7 0 the effluent ph values increased to 7 58 0 13 and 8 14 0 05 respectively when the initial ph was 9 0 the effluent ph decreased to 8 46 0 12 the ph in wastewater is an important factor affecting the growth and proliferation of microorganisms 26 different ph values can change the structure and activity of enzymes in microalgae thus affecting the decolorization efficiency 18 27 28 microorganisms in rab reactors can adjust the ph to the optimal value for their own growth and reproduction indicating that the rab system has a good tolerance to various ph levels 3 2 2 effect of sulfate sulfate is a common pollutant found in municipal and industrial wastewater such as that from the pharmaceutical tanning mining petrochemical printing and dyeing industries 29 dye wastewater containing different concentrations of sulfate and ao 2 was added to the rab reactors at a hrt of 12 h the results are shown in table 2 no significant differences were observed in the degradation efficiencies at low sulfate concentrations at a high sulfate concentration 3 g l the degradation efficiency decreased slightly and increasing the sulfate concentration did not significantly affect the degradation efficiency of azo dyes p 0 05 these results were consistent with those reported by roberts 30 zhou 19 demonstrated that rab are efficient for the treatment of sulfur containing wastewater with a degradation efficiency of up to 46 a lack of sulfur inhibits the growth and reproduction of microalgae however at higher concentrations many sulfates are transformed into sulfides and enriched in water under the action of anaerobic microorganisms thus resulting in toxic effects 31 in the sulfate redox process electron transfer forms a competitive relationship with the breaking of azo bonds thus the decolorization efficiency of the dyes is affected 30 dorian et al 32 found that each dye has different effects on the sulfate reduction process and the presence of different functional groups and the position of azo bonds significantly affects the toxicity and decolorization efficiency 3 3 the potential role of microbiology in decolorization to study the possible causes of dye degradation dyes of the same concentration were placed in triangular bottles under different conditions and irradiated continuously under natural light fig 4 shows that the complete biofilm had the best decolorization effect on ao 2 indicating that the combination of extracellular and intracellular enzymes secreted in the biofilm can rapidly degrade ao 2 however when using broken biofilms i e no cells but retaining the activity of various enzymes although azo dyes still exhibited significant degradation the degradation rate reduced however under conditions apart from biotic factors natural light and sulfate reduction could not remove ao 2 this also proves that the degradation of ao 2 by rab mainly depends on the enzymatic action of microbial cells and that microorganisms and their enzymes can decolorize azo dyes through metabolic reactions under aerobic conditions 33 this is consistent with previous results 34 35 3 4 bioanalysis to explore the key microorganisms and characteristics of the biofilm community involved in ao 2 degradation high throughput sequencing was used to analyze prokaryotes and eukaryotes in biofilms from reactors with four different initial ao 2 concentrations 3 4 1 variation in the bacterial community changes in the abundance of prokaryotes in the biofilms were detected at the genus level as shown in fig 5 at a concentration of 50 mg l blastocatella phylum acidobacteria was the dominant genus with a relative abundance of 55 29 acidobacteria has been used for nitrogen and phosphorus removal and iron reduction in activated sludge wastewater treatment plants acidobacteria have been used to degrade hydrocarbons aldehydes heterocycles amines alcohols phenols ketones and other pollutants in petrochemical wastewater 36 microbial communities containing acidobacteria have been reported to degrade various environmental pollutants including dyes 37 39 with increasing ao 2 concentration the relative frequency of blastocatella decreased and the proportions of nodosilinea pcc 7104 and leptolyngbya lege 06070 increased both nodosilinea and leptolyngbya belong to the cyanobacteria phylum the ratios of chlorophyll bearing blue green algae to prokaryotes at the four different dye concentrations 50 100 150 and 200 mg l were 26 88 57 39 46 76 and 26 25 respectively cyanobacteria are widely used for the degradation of azo dyes and recent reports have demonstrated the use of the biological characteristics of cyanobacteria to enhance the rate of azo dye degradation in bioreactors priya et al 40 showed that c i 1 a diazo dye could be degraded and decolorized by cyanobacteria breaking the naphthalene and benzene rings in pollutants to form aliphatic compounds with the complete mineralization of the dye into co2 grade nh3 it was used as a nitrogen source which is consistent with the results of this experiment when the ao 2 concentration was 200 mg l the relative abundances of arenibacter and methylibium were much higher than those at other ao 2 concentrations up to 13 44 and 10 26 respectively the genus arenibacter is known to be strictly aerobic methylibium belonging to the phylum proteobacteria can be grown directly using toluene benzene ethylbenzene and other carbon sources 41 42 although arenibacter and methylibium cannot decolorize dyes arenibacter can efficiently degrade the polycyclic alkanes produced after the deamination of ao 2 thus arenibacter and methylibium occurred in biofilms with high concentrations of ao 2 the increase in the relative content of arenibacter may be due to the accumulation of by products and the increase in aromatic hydrocarbons during the degradation of ao shabbir et al 43 evaluated the degradation of the azo dye amaranth and found that cyanobacteria proteobacteria and bacteroidetes were the dominant populations of epiphytes in bioreactors and that the dyes were degraded into non toxic aliphatic compounds 3 4 2 variation in the eukaryota community composition in this study the effects of azo dyes on eukaryotic communities were studied to understand the effects of dye wastewater on microbial communities and the characteristics of eukaryotic communities during the degradation process fig 6 shows that chlorophyta included multiple genera and its relative abundance declined rapidly from 9 50 to 0 38 as the ao 2 concentration increased from 50 to 200 mg l the relative abundance of chlorella decreased from 6 25 to 0 02 although the removal of azo dyes by chlorella has been extensively studied the treatable dye concentrations are generally low approximately 20 mg l as presented in table 1 these findings suggest that toxic aromatic amines affect the growth and reproduction of some algae during the operation of the reactor as by products of the decolorization and degradation of azo dyes at the genus level unidentified adinetida were dominant in rab biofilms with different concentrations of dye influent with relative frequencies ranging from 35 22 to 71 58 the unidentified genus adinetida belongs to the phylum rotifera kingdom animalia considering that ao 2 was the only source of n for microorganisms in this experiment we speculated that high density rotifers would improve the n uptake capacity of biofilms and be conducive to biomass accumulation liu et al 44 confirmed that high density rotifers contribute significantly to the biological food web by selectively feeding on algae removing most of the biofilm biomass facilitating the import of biofilm biomass substrates affecting the primary productivity of biofilms and stimulating bacterial growth the relative abundance of rhogostoma increased from 0 27 to 14 7 as the dye concentration increased from 50 mg l to 200 mg l rhogostoma is widely present in wastewater treatment plants and is a good indicator of denitrification nitrification and flocculation rhogostoma belongs to the phylum cercozoan as a protozoan that feeds on fungi and algae it has been reported as the dominant population in azo dye wastewater removal cercozoa controls biomass on biofilms by its bacterophagy and algophilic feeding high abundance of rotifers and cercozoans suggest that the reactor formed a mature biofilm system azo dyes are degraded by microorganisms to achieve complete mineralization mainly by azo reductase which is widespread in microorganisms especially in higher eukaryotes via azo reductase microorganisms can achieve the eco friendly biodegradation of azo dyes and aromatic compounds based on the microbial enzyme system benthic microbes which are more tolerant can therefore thrive in the reactor yaseen confirmed this conjecture during rab operation ao 2 acts as the only nitrogen source although the bacteria can t break azo bonds by cooperating with cyanobacteria they can get nitrogen from cyanobacteria in addition bacteria detoxify cyanobacteria by degrading the aromatic compounds of ao 2 after nitrogen removal and promote the further degradation of ao 2 by cyanobacteria azo dyes can be completely degraded by the microbial enzyme system under the cooperative microbial system while benthic organisms optimize tolerance to the reactor and play a significant role in controlling the microbial biomass although the characteristics of the microbial community differed among azo dye dosages the degradation efficiency of dyes did not differ among dye concentrations these findings further confirmed that the rab reactor was well tolerated therefore rab is an effective approach to treat azo dye wastewater in a highly efficient and environmentally friendly manner 4 conclusions the degradation efficiency of ao 2 by the rab was 95 under the action of microalgae loaded on the substrate high concentrations of so4 2 did not influence the dye removal in the ph range of 5 9 the rab maintained excellent dye removal performance an analysis of the underlying mechanisms revealed that both the intact algal biofilm and the substance generated by the algal biofilm could degrade dyes indicating that ao 2 was decomposed by enzyme activity the azo bond of ao 2 can be deactivated by cyanobacteria and the aromatic amines produced by ao 2 can be degraded by a variety of bacteria rotifers and cercozoa in biofilms

12732,under the traditional suspended culture system for algae processing high concentrations of azo dyes is difficult because of poor light transmittance in wastewater the rotating algal biofilm rab system enables algal biofilms to receive adequate light even in the presence of high concentrations of dye the degradation efficiency of acid orange 2 ao 2 at concentrations of 50 600 mg l exceeded 95 within 12 24 h and the highest removal rate was 592 35 mg l d fourier transform infrared spectroscopy showed that the azo bond was broken in ao 2 and the main decomposition products were amines and olefins the sulfate concentration did not influence the ao 2 removal whereas the ph had a significant effect p 0 001 the dye degradation efficiencies under acidic and neutral conditions were higher than those under alkaline conditions decolorization experiments indicated that the extracellular and intracellular enzymes synergistically degraded ao 2 high throughput sequencing revealed that biofilms in rab reactors contained a variety of taxa including cyanobacteria bacteria rotifera and cercozoa the potential cause of ao 2 biodegradation by algae bacterial systems is that the biofilm can use ao 2 as a nitrogen source for its own growth keywords azo dye acid orange 2 biodegradation algae biofilm data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction azo compounds are formed by the coupling of diazoimines with amines or phenols through one or more azo bonds with the structural formula r n n r azo dyes are extensively used in printing paper making medicine cosmetics textile printing and dyeing industries owing to their simple synthesis stable dyeing performance and rich types and styles 1 2 more than 3000 azo dyes have been used in various practical

respectively the v4 region of the 18s rrna gene for eukaryota was amplified with the primers 528f 5 gcggtaattccagctccaa 3 and 706r 5 aatccragaatttcacctct 3 19 2 6 2 analysis of microbial community diversity and richness operational taxonomic units otus classify closely related individuals e g strains genera or species based on the phylogenetic or population genetics clustering was necessary to obtain the number of bacteria and genera present in the sample based on the sequencing results all sequences were divided into otus according to their degree of similarity and a threshold similarity

database project rdp and greengene databases were used for the comparison fgr and rdp were used for the functional gene analysis based on the genbank functional gene database the qiime platform was used with a confidence threshold of 0 7 for the rdp classifier 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation effect and products 3 1 1 degradation effect different concentrations of ao 2 50 600 mg l were injected into the reactor as shown in fig 1 by adjusting the hrt the degradation efficiency of the rab exceeded 95 the degradation efficiencies at 200 and 600 mg l were 97 3 2 2 and 98 25 0 04 respectively the highest removal rate was 592 35 mg l d for 600 mg l a comparison of the pollutant removal performance with those of previous studies is provided in table 1 the degradation efficiencies obtained in this study were much higher than those of previously reported suspension systems and other biosystems table 1 biofilms could grow with ao 2 as the only n source in the influent indicating that the microorganisms in the biofilm were capable of decomposing and growing azo dyes these results indicate that the rab reactor has a good tolerance and the microorganisms in it can efficiently break the azo bond of ao 2 and efficiently capture and utilize the resulting n the symbiotic effects of bacteria and algae on the rupture of azo bonds absorption efficiency and utilization of nitrogen sources were greater than those of the single population treatment of dye wastewater 3 1 2 analysis of ao 2 degradation products we studied the variation in the degradation products of the dye in the rab by uv scanning of the effluent at different time points the uv absorption spectra are important indicators of the decolorization and degradation of azo dyes fig 2 shows that the characteristic absorption peak 484 nm of ao 2 gradually decreases as the operation time increases the degradation efficiencies of ao 2 reached 75 19 and 97 38 after 3 and 6 h respectively these results indicate that ao 2 can be effectively degraded in the rab reactor and the degradation efficiency was consistent with the results shown in fig 1 fig 2b shows the ft ir characteristics of the incoming and outgoing water samples from the rab system the main degradation products of ao 2 were amines 3407 nm and olefins 1663 nm most bacteria fracture azo bonds under anaerobic conditions however dyes cannot easily be degraded under aerobic conditions 24 25 in contrast the mechanism underlying the degradation of azo dyes by cyanobacteria differs from that by bacteria azo dyes are degraded by cyanobacteria mainly by laccase and azo reductase and the azo bond is degraded into ammonia nitrogen which is then absorbed and utilized the rab mainly operated under aerobic conditions and the dye removal effect was obvious indicating that cyanobacteria were vital components of the rab reactors the initial degradation of azo dyes into aromatic amines is known to be a key step in decolorization the complete mineralization of toxic aromatic amines into environmental substances is the last link in the degradation process of azo dyes and determines whether the dye wastewater can be discharged after treatment 3 2 effect of ph and sulfate 3 2 1 effect of ph the effect of ph was evaluated by feeding the reactors with 100 mg l of ao 2 at ph values of 5 7 and 9 for 16 cycles as shown in fig 3 the degradation efficiency of ao 2 decreased from 98 5 0 3 to 96 7 1 1 when the ph of wastewater changed from acidic to alkaline fig 3a and the differences among ph values were significant p 0 001 furthermore as shown in fig 3 b when the initial ph values of dye wastewater were 5 0 and 7 0 the effluent ph values increased to 7 58 0 13 and 8 14 0 05 respectively when the initial ph was 9 0 the effluent ph decreased to 8 46 0 12 the ph in wastewater is an important factor affecting the growth and proliferation of microorganisms 26 different ph values can change the structure and activity of enzymes in microalgae thus affecting the decolorization efficiency 18 27 28 microorganisms in rab reactors can adjust the ph to the optimal value for their own growth and reproduction indicating that the rab system has a good tolerance to various ph levels 3 2 2 effect of sulfate sulfate is a common pollutant found in municipal and industrial wastewater such as that from the pharmaceutical tanning mining petrochemical printing and dyeing industries 29 dye wastewater containing different concentrations of sulfate and ao 2 was added to the rab reactors at a hrt of 12 h the results are shown in table 2 no significant differences were observed in the degradation efficiencies at low sulfate concentrations at a high sulfate concentration 3 g l the degradation efficiency decreased slightly and increasing the sulfate concentration did not significantly affect the degradation efficiency of azo dyes p 0 05 these results were consistent with those reported by roberts 30 zhou 19 demonstrated that rab are efficient for the treatment of sulfur containing wastewater with a degradation efficiency of up to 46 a lack of sulfur inhibits the growth and reproduction of microalgae however at higher concentrations many sulfates are transformed into sulfides and enriched in water under the action of anaerobic microorganisms thus resulting in toxic effects 31 in the sulfate redox process electron transfer forms a competitive relationship with the breaking of azo bonds thus the decolorization efficiency of the dyes is affected 30 dorian et al 32 found that each dye has different effects on the sulfate reduction process and the presence of different functional groups and the position of azo bonds significantly affects the toxicity and decolorization efficiency 3 3 the potential role of microbiology in decolorization to study the possible causes of dye degradation dyes of the same concentration were placed in triangular bottles under different conditions and irradiated continuously under natural light fig 4 shows that the complete biofilm had the best decolorization effect on ao 2 indicating that the combination of extracellular and intracellular enzymes secreted in the biofilm can rapidly degrade ao 2 however when using broken biofilms i e no cells but retaining the activity of various enzymes although azo dyes still exhibited significant degradation the degradation rate reduced however under conditions apart from biotic factors natural light and sulfate reduction could not remove ao 2 this also proves that the degradation of ao 2 by rab mainly depends on the enzymatic action of microbial cells and that microorganisms and their enzymes can decolorize azo dyes through metabolic reactions under aerobic conditions 33 this is consistent with previous results 34 35 3 4 bioanalysis to explore the key microorganisms and characteristics of the biofilm community involved in ao 2 degradation high throughput sequencing was used to analyze prokaryotes and eukaryotes in biofilms from reactors with four different initial ao 2 concentrations 3 4 1 variation in the bacterial community changes in the abundance of prokaryotes in the biofilms were detected at the genus level as shown in fig 5 at a concentration of 50 mg l blastocatella phylum acidobacteria was the dominant genus with a relative abundance of 55 29 acidobacteria has been used for nitrogen and phosphorus removal and iron reduction in activated sludge wastewater treatment plants acidobacteria have been used to degrade hydrocarbons aldehydes heterocycles amines alcohols phenols ketones and other pollutants in petrochemical wastewater 36 microbial communities containing acidobacteria have been reported to degrade various environmental pollutants including dyes 37 39 with increasing ao 2 concentration the relative frequency of blastocatella decreased and the proportions of nodosilinea pcc 7104 and leptolyngbya lege 06070 increased both nodosilinea and leptolyngbya belong to the cyanobacteria phylum the ratios of chlorophyll bearing blue green algae to prokaryotes at the four different dye concentrations 50 100 150 and 200 mg l were 26 88 57 39 46 76 and 26 25 respectively cyanobacteria are widely used for the degradation of azo dyes and recent reports have demonstrated the use of the biological characteristics of cyanobacteria to enhance the rate of azo dye degradation in bioreactors priya et al 40 showed that c i 1 a diazo dye could be degraded and decolorized by cyanobacteria breaking the naphthalene and benzene rings in pollutants to form aliphatic compounds with the complete mineralization of the dye into co2 grade nh3 it was used as a nitrogen source which is consistent with the results of this experiment when the ao 2 concentration was 200 mg l the relative abundances of arenibacter and methylibium were much higher than those at other ao 2 concentrations up to 13 44 and 10 26 respectively the genus arenibacter is known to be strictly aerobic methylibium belonging to the phylum proteobacteria can be grown directly using toluene benzene ethylbenzene and other carbon sources 41 42 although arenibacter and methylibium cannot decolorize dyes arenibacter can efficiently degrade the polycyclic alkanes produced after the deamination of ao 2 thus arenibacter and methylibium occurred in biofilms with high concentrations of ao 2 the increase in the relative content of arenibacter may be due to the accumulation of by products and the increase in aromatic hydrocarbons during the degradation of ao shabbir et al 43 evaluated the degradation of the azo dye amaranth and found that cyanobacteria proteobacteria and bacteroidetes were the dominant populations of epiphytes in bioreactors and that the dyes were degraded into non toxic aliphatic compounds 3 4 2 variation in the eukaryota community composition in this study the effects of azo dyes on eukaryotic communities were studied to understand the effects of dye wastewater on microbial communities and the characteristics of eukaryotic communities during the degradation process fig 6 shows that chlorophyta included multiple genera and its relative abundance declined rapidly from 9 50 to 0 38 as the ao 2 concentration increased from 50 to 200 mg l the relative abundance of chlorella decreased from 6 25 to 0 02 although the removal of azo dyes by chlorella has been extensively studied the treatable dye concentrations are generally low approximately 20 mg l as presented in table 1 these findings suggest that toxic aromatic amines affect the growth and reproduction of some algae during the operation of the reactor as by products of the decolorization and degradation of azo dyes at the genus level unidentified adinetida were dominant in rab biofilms with different concentrations of dye influent with relative frequencies ranging from 35 22 to 71 58 the unidentified genus adinetida belongs to the phylum rotifera kingdom animalia considering that ao 2 was the only source of n for microorganisms in this experiment we speculated that high density rotifers would improve the n uptake capacity of biofilms and be conducive to biomass accumulation liu et al 44 confirmed that high density rotifers contribute significantly to the biological food web by selectively feeding on algae removing most of the biofilm biomass facilitating the import of biofilm biomass substrates affecting the primary productivity of biofilms and stimulating bacterial growth the relative abundance of rhogostoma increased from 0 27 to 14 7 as the dye concentration increased from 50 mg l to 200 mg l rhogostoma is widely present in wastewater treatment plants and is a good indicator of denitrification nitrification and flocculation rhogostoma belongs to the phylum cercozoan as a protozoan that feeds on fungi and algae it has been reported as the dominant population in azo dye wastewater removal cercozoa controls biomass on biofilms by its bacterophagy and algophilic feeding high abundance of rotifers and cercozoans suggest that the reactor formed a mature biofilm system azo dyes are degraded by microorganisms to achieve complete mineralization mainly by azo reductase which is widespread in microorganisms especially in higher eukaryotes via azo reductase microorganisms can achieve the eco friendly biodegradation of azo dyes and aromatic compounds based on the microbial enzyme system benthic microbes which are more tolerant can therefore thrive in the reactor yaseen confirmed this conjecture during rab operation ao 2 acts as the only nitrogen source although the bacteria can t break azo bonds by cooperating with cyanobacteria they can get nitrogen from cyanobacteria in addition bacteria detoxify cyanobacteria by degrading the aromatic compounds of ao 2 after nitrogen removal and promote the further degradation of ao 2 by cyanobacteria azo dyes can be completely degraded by the microbial enzyme system under the cooperative microbial system while benthic organisms optimize tolerance to the reactor and play a significant role in controlling the microbial biomass although the characteristics of the microbial community differed among azo dye dosages the degradation efficiency of dyes did not differ among dye concentrations these findings further confirmed that the rab reactor was well tolerated therefore rab is an effective approach to treat azo dye wastewater in a highly efficient and environmentally friendly manner 4 conclusions the degradation efficiency of ao 2 by the rab was 95 under the action of microalgae loaded on the substrate high concentrations of so4 2 did not influence the dye removal in the ph range of 5 9 the rab maintained excellent dye removal performance an analysis of the underlying mechanisms revealed that both the intact algal biofilm and the substance generated by the algal biofilm could degrade dyes indicating that ao 2 was decomposed by enzyme activity the azo bond of ao 2 can be deactivated by cyanobacteria and the aromatic amines produced by ao 2 can be degraded by a variety of bacteria rotifers and cercozoa in biofilms

12733,in the present work the degradation pathways and mechanism of rhodamine b rhb using a novel liquid film dielectric barrier discharge dbd plasma reactor were examined moreover the optimization of the performance of dbd was discussed the results showed that the atmosphere of the discharge area and the input power had a significant effect on the removal of rhb after 21 min of treatment using dbd plasma system about 90 2 of rhb was degraded under the following experimental conditions initial rhb concentration of 40 mg l input power of 125 w and initial ph of 6 78 the use of free radical scavengers proved that hydroxyl radicals played a key role in the degradation of rhb in addition the degradation intermediates of rhb were identified using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry and possible degradation pathways were proposed during the degradation of rhb with the extension of treatment time the values of cod bod5 and toc decreased after the treatment using dbd plasma the bod5 cod of rhb solution increased from 0 0326 to 0 3867 and the biodegradability was also observed to have greatly improved the potential toxicity was predicted by us epa test software graphical abstract

introduction with the development of industrialization and modernization water pollution has gradually become a global challenge from the perspective of the types of wastewater industrial wastewater has a wider source than domestic wastewater including pharmaceutical chemical printing and dyeing petrochemical and other industries 1 3 among them dyeing wastewater which poses a huge threat to human health and water quality environment is difficult to be degraded due to its complicated synthetic sources and complex molecular structure 4 therefore the treatment of dyeing wastewater is of worldwide concern previous studies have shown that conventional wastewater treatment methods such as microbiological methods 5 adsorption 6 coagulation 7 and membrane separation 8 cannot effectively treat synthetic dye compounds therefore advanced treatment technologies are required to remove these compounds from wastewaters in recent years advanced oxidation processes aops have attracted widespread attention due to their high processing efficiency fast reaction and wide adaptability 9 they can produce a variety of highly active species to degrade pollutants especially the hydroxyl radicals oh 10 several aops have been studied to efficiently degradate rhb wastewater such as photocatalytic 11 peroxymonosulfate pms 12 fenton like 13 and electro catazone 14 among different types of aops non thermal plasma ntps can operate at lower temperatures room temperature and take less time 15 in addition ntp neither produces secondary pollution nor requires the addition of other chemicals or chemical precursors moreover npt can effectively destroy the structure of dyes in dyeing wastewater and improve the biodegradability of dye wastewater 16 there are many types of discharge reactors such as barrier discharge 17 gliding arc discharge 18 radio frequency discharge 19 and microwave discharge 20 liquid film dielectric barrier discharge dbd is based on the application of an electric field to break down the gas to generate a large number of high energy electrons and ionized gas that is full of active substances moreover dbd promotes the production of more active substances under the chain reaction thereby degrading the pollutants 21 dbd can act on organic pollutants in water through active free radicals h o and oh active substances oh o3 and h2o2 and physical effects ultra violet uv light and shock waves 22 23 it was reported that acid orange 7 could be efficiently removed by dbd 24 besides our previous study examined the degradation of deet under three different discharge models 23 water fall film reactor is considered to be very good at treating organic pollutants due to more energetic electrons reactive substances and uv radiation in the discharge area 25 in the present study a new type of uniaxial sleeve wet wall dbd plasma system was built and oxanthracene dye rhodamine b rhb was taken as the target pollutant firstly the effects of several discharge system parameters on the degradation of rhb were investigated furthermore the effects of solution parameters such as initial solution concentration initial ph value and the concentration of anions on the degradation of rhb were investigated the generation and action mechanism of h2o2 and o3 and the roles of oh and h in the treatment process were analyzed and discussed finally according to the results of liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms total organic carbon toc and ultraviolet visible uv vis spectroscopy the degradation mechanism of rhb and possible intermediate products were analyzed 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials except that isopropanol is guaranteed reagent pure and purchased from merck all reagents including rhb 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 1 piperidinyloxy tempo and other chemical reagents are analytical pure and purchased from aladdin ultrapure water was used for all experiments 2 2 apparatus and methods the dbd setup used in this study is shown in fig 1 the setup mainly consisted of an energy input system a gas source control system an analysis and detection system and a solution circulation reaction system the dbd plasma reactor consisted of a quartz tube outer cylinder diameter 50 mm a quartz inner cylinder diameter 25 mm and a copper electrode diameter 5 mm the reactor caused the reaction solution to form a uniform and slow liquid film on the inner wall of the inner cylinder through overflow and used quartz as a barrier medium to form a discharge area in the inner cylinder by applying a voltage to a stainless steel rod the atmosphere of the discharge area was controlled through the input of different proportions of gas sources whereas the active species excited by the discharge diffused into the wastewater through the mass transfer process to degrade the targeted pollutants the power was controlled by adjusting the voltage of the transformer the volume of treated water was 300 ml while the reaction time was 21 min the samples were taken from the solution after turning the power off and analyzed after pretreatment filtration dilution and the addition of reagents 2 3 analysis methods the concentration of h2o2 was determined by the titanium salt photometric method the specific operation was as follows 2 ml sample solution 4 ml h2so4 3 mol l k2tio c2o4 2 0 05 mol l were mixed together and then allowed to stand for 10 min the absorbance of the treated solution was measured at 400 nm by a uv vis spectrophotometer 26 the degradation products were detected by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms with a c18 column 4 6 mm 150 mm particle size 5 μm the column temperature was 35 c and the mobile phase was a mixture of acetonitrile and phosphate buffer 40 60 at a flow rate of 0 3 ml min for 10 min the liquid phase ozone concentration was determined by the 7685 series ozone monitor of german b c company and the gas phase ozone concentration was determined by iodine titration 27 the specific determination method was that 350 ml water and 20 ml ki 20 were added to the absorption bottle 5 ml h2so4 3 mol l was added after the absorption was completed the ozone concentration was titrated with 1 ml starch solution 0 1 g l and na2s2o3 0 1 mol l after 5 min and then calculated according to eq 1 1 c o 3 v 1 0 1 10 3 2 48 10 3 v 0 mg l where v 0 is the volume of the absorbing liquid l v 1 is the volume of the solution used for calibration ml 48 is the molar mass g mol the total organic carbon toc was determined using a toc analyzer toc 5000a shimadzu japan the removal rate of toc was calculated using eq 2 2 η toc toc 0 toc t toc 0 100 among them η toc is the removal rate of toc in pollutant solution toc 0 is the concentration of toc before treatment mg l and toc t is the concentration of toc in the solution at t time mg l five day biochemical oxygen demand bod5 and chemical oxygen demand cod were determined by multi parameter water quality tester the absorbance of the sample was measured using a uv vis spectrophotometer at 552 nm and the concentration of rhb was calculated according to the standard curve the removal rates of rhb were calculated using eq 3 3 η rhb c 0 c t c 0 100 where η rhb is the degradation rate of rhb c 0 is the concentration of rhb before treatment mg l and c t is the concentration of the reactant after a certain reaction time period t mg l the energy yield is an index to evaluate the quality of pollutants degraded by the unit energy consumed by the system the energy yield of rhb was calculated using the following eq 4 4 γ c 0 v η rhb p input t 10 3 where γ is the energy yield of the system g kw h c 0 is the rhb concentration before the solution is treated mg l v is the volume of the solution participating in the reaction l η rhb is the rhb degradation rate in the reaction time t p input is the input power of the system and t is the reaction time of the system 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of initial concentration of rhb the effect of initial concentration of rhb on its degradation using dbd plasma is illustrated in fig 2 fig 2a showed that the degradation rates within 3 min under the four concentrations of 20 mg l 30 mg l 40 mg l and 50 mg l reached 45 41 36 and 32 respectively moreover after 21 min the degradation rates were 86 90 93 and 96 respectively it can be seen from fig 2b that the energy yield at low initial concentration of rhb was lower than that at higher initial concentration these results indicated that the degradation rate of rhb using dbd plasma system decreased with the increase in the initial concentration of rhb the main reason for this phenomenon was that the rate of reactive species produced by the discharge was stable under certain conditions and the probability of collision and the combination of pollutant molecules and reactive species could be affected by the concentration of the pollutant in addition after the pollutant molecules were oxidized by the reactive species an intermediate was produced the intermediate competed with the pollutant molecules for the reactive species causing the initial concentration to increase and the degradation rate to decrease on the other hand when the initial concentration was low the energy dissipation occurred and only a small part of the energy was used for the degradation of pollutant 28 therefore the energy yield of low concentration is lower than that of high concentration 3 2 effect of initial ph value fig 2c showed the effect of ph value on the degradation of rhb ph was adjusted by naoh 1 mol l and hcl 1 mol l when the ph was 3 5 9 and 11 the degradation rates of rhb within 21 min were 100 100 99 and 100 respectively however the degradation rate of rhb at ph 7 was 94 higher rhb degradation at acidic ph value could been seen by this result and it was attributed to the increased formation and accumulation of h2o2 and oh radicals at acidic ph levels 29 additionally under alkaline levels dissolved o3 molecules were easily decomposed to generate oh which led to the degradation of rhb resulting in a higher degradation rate under alkaline levels than under neutral levels 30 31 3 3 effect of input power the first important factor that impacts the concentration of active species is the input power the effect of input power on the degradation of rhb was investigated and the results are shown in fig 2d as the input power increased the degradation rate of rhb dyes also increased when the input power was 100 w the degradation rate of rhb was 85 the input power was further increased to 125 w 150 w and 175 w the degradation rate of rhb increased to 90 92 and 94 respectively with the increasing of input power from 100 w to 175 w the rate constant k of the system also increased from 0 0899 to 0 1292 min 1 the electric field intensity and discharge density of the reaction area were determined by the discharge power a large amount of active species oh o and o3 and ultraviolet radiation intensity were produced during the discharge process 32 33 as the discharge power increased the electrons gained more energy in the electric field and induced more oxygen and water molecules to ionize through collisions thus resulting in the formation of more active substances and stronger ultraviolet radiation 34 therefore the removal efficiency of rhb increased with the increase in input power with the increase in discharge power the stronger the signal of the emission spectrum the more the formation of the active substances 35 as shown in fig 3f with the increase in degradation rate the energy yield decreased rapidly the reason may be that as the rhb molecules continued to degrade into smaller molecular substances the probability of the rhb molecules in the solution binding to the active substances decreased accordingly 28 3 4 effect of gas discharge atmosphere in the gas phase plasma in contact with the liquid phase the composition of gas affects the type of generated active substances fig 3a showed that when the discharge atmosphere was pure oxygen the rhb was completely degraded in 9 min moreover when the discharge atmosphere consisted of air ar ar o2 8 2 and ar o2 5 5 the degradation rates within 21 min were 92 98 99 and 100 respectively it can be seen from the results that the rate of degradation for the dye in air plasma was relatively low which was caused by the combination of oh and reactive nitrogen species in the air see reaction eq 5 30 5 no 2 oh hno 3 the hydroxyl radical is a very important reactive species in the degradation of pollutants therefore as the proportion of o2 in the discharge atmosphere decreased the degradation rate of rhb decreased 3 5 effect of liquid circulation rate the liquid circulation rate directly determines the thickness and uniformity of the water film in the discharge area the effect of different liquid circulation flowrates on the degradation of rhb is shown in fig 3b when the flow rates of the liquid film were 150 ml min 170 ml min and 190 ml min the degradation rates of rhb dyes at 21 min were 95 97 and 99 respectively when the circulating flow rate of the liquid film was at a low level the short circuit phenomenon will be formed on the inner wall the liquid film did not flow uniformly and formed multiple small trickles which will drastically reduce the surface area of the solution exposed to the discharge area due to this reason the probability of high energy electrons free radicals and other reactive species entering the solution was reduced 28 in addition the energy yield constantly decreased with the progression of the reaction as shown in fig 3e when the flow rate was 190 ml min the energy yield was 1 087 g kw h with the degradation rate of 57 moreover when the degradation rate increased to 99 the energy yield was 0 2717 g kw h the reason for this phenomenon may be that there were a large number of intermediate and pollutant molecules in the solution to compete for active substances on the other hand the heat energy of the system was dissipated 3 6 effect of different anions in practice wastewater often contains a variety of anions such as cl so4 2 no3 and co3 2 which can consume reactive species fig 3c revealed the effect of cl so4 2 no3 and co3 2 on the degradation of rhb the presence of anions in the solution can relatively inhibit the degradation process this could be due to the following reactions occurring in the solution eqs 6 7 36 6 oh so 4 2 h so 4 h 2 o 7 oh cl h cl h 2 o as shown in reaction 6 cl and oh produce cl the redox potential of cl 1 36 v is lower than oh 2 80 v therefore the presence of cl in the solution inhibited the degradation process as shown in reaction 7 so4 was formed by this reaction and the redox potential of so4 2 50 v is higher than cl 1 36 v the inhibitory effect of cl on rhb is greater than that of so4 2 8 no 3 hv no 2 o 9 no 3 hv h 2 o no 2 oh oh 10 o h 2 o 2 oh in the process of dbd plasma ultraviolet radiation plays an important role in the degradation of pollutants 37 no3 inhibited some reactions catalyzed by ultraviolet radiation eq 8 thus reducing the formation of oh on the other hand it can also form oh through certain other reactions eqs 9 10 38 therefore no3 does not significantly affect the degradation of rhb it is well known that co3 2 is a strong hydroxyl radical scavenger and its product can continue to combine with oh thus consistently consuming oh in the solution eqs 11 13 38 it can be seen in fig 3d that when the concentration of co3 2 in the solution became higher the degradation of rhb began to deteriorate 11 co 3 2 oh co 3 oh 12 h 2 o co 3 2 oh hco 3 13 hco 3 oh co 3 oh 3 7 degradation mechanism and analysis of active components 3 7 1 role of o3 in the degradation of rhb some studies have pointed out that ozone will be formed through two steps in the discharge zone 39 firstly o2 molecules are excited into o radicals followed by a three body reaction to generate o3 molecules then the o3 molecules are diffused and dissolved into the solution the reactions are represented by eqs 14 16 40 14 e o 2 2o e 15 o o 2 m o 3 gas m 16 o 3 gas o 3 aq fig 4 showed the concentration of o3 of liquid ozone and gas phase ozone produced by the dbd plasma system under different discharge atmospheres it can be seen that when the discharge atmosphere was ar there were no o2 molecules in the gas therefore the gas phase ozone concentration could not be detected the cumulative concentration of 0 04 mg l was presumed to be due to insufficient air tightness of the device and a small amount of air was ionized when the proportion of o2 in the discharge atmosphere was further increased to ar o2 8 2 the cumulative gas phase ozone concentration increased by 2 82 mg l however the cumulative gas phase ozone concentration in the air atmosphere was 1 34 mg l previous studies indicated that the following reactions exist in gas eqs 17 20 41 42 17 n 2 e 2 n e 18 n o no 19 no o no 2 20 no o 3 o 2 no 2 argon molecules were excited under the influence of electric field to form ar and excited electrons then the ar reacted with h2o molecules to generate oh radicals eqs 21 22 43 21 ar ar e 22 ar 2h 2 o h 3 o ar oh therefore when n2 existed in the gas it will not only snatch a part of high energy electrons but also generate no which reacted with o3 and resulted in a decrease in the gas phase ozone concentration furthermore the ratio of ar to o2 was ar o2 5 5 and the gas phase ozone concentration reached 4 14 mg l which was due to the increase in the content of o2 molecules it was interesting to notice that when the cumulative concentration of liquid ozone in air ar and aro2 was compared the variation pattern of the liquid ozone concentration was inconsistent with the cumulative concentration of gas phase ozone among the known way gas phase ozone diffused into the solution through gas liquid mass transfer thereby increasing the cumulative concentration of ozone in the liquid phase however the cumulative concentrations of ozone in the liquid phase under ar and ar o2 8 2 atmosphere were 0 89 mg l and 0 98 mg l respectively combined with the results reported in some previous studies 44 the generation mechanism of liquid phase ozone in dbd plasma system was deduced and is shown in fig 5 in addition to gas liquid diffusion there were more important ways to produce ozone eq 23 23 o 2 oh h o 3 the source of liquid ozone generation was mainly based on this reaction it can be seen that the hydroxyl radical was closely related to the concentration of ozone eqs 24 25 35 24 o 3 o o 2 25 o h 2 o 2 oh 3 7 2 role of h2o2 in the degradation of rhb among the active species produced by dbd plasma system the residence time of h2o2 is relatively long in order to study whether h2o2 contributes to the degradation of rhb or not the content of h2o2 under different experimental conditions was tested and the results are shown in fig 4 when the power was 125 w 150 w and 175 w the cumulative concentrations of h2o2 in the water solution were 3 77 mg l 4 59 mg l and 6 15 mg l at 21 min respectively when the power was increased the dbd system generated more high energy electrons oh o3 and h2o2 in the solution some studies have reported that the principle of h2o2 generation in the solution follows the reaction eq 26 45 26 oh oh h 2 o 2 meanwhile when h2o2 was added to the system the overall degradation rate of the pollutant within the concentration range of 0 2 0 8 mg l and 10 min changed insignificantly when the added amounts of h2o2 were changed through values of 1 ml 2 ml and 3 ml the pollutant degradation rate changed to values of 51 55 and 61 respectively indicating that the degradation rate of rhb increased significantly hydrogen peroxide h2o2 can directly or indirectly participate in the removal of rhb however the oxidation potential of h2o2 is low due to which its contribution to the degradation process of the pollutant is small it is generally believed that in the dbd system h2o2 achieved the purpose of degrading rhb through electron collision reaction with o3 and ultraviolet decomposition these phenomena are represented by the reaction eqs 27 29 22 46 27 e h 2 o 2 oh oh 28 h 2 o 2 o 3 ho 2 o 2 oh 29 h 2 o 2 hv oh oh 3 7 3 effect of different radical scavengers on the degradation of rhb the radical scavenging experiments were carried out to explore the role of radicals on the degradation of rhb in the dbd plasma system in this experiment isopropanol ipa and tempo were used as the oh scavengers and ccl4 was used to remove h furthermore c6o4h2 was used to remove o2 47 some radical scavengers can capture radicals in the reaction process through reaction eqs 30 31 48 30 ch 3 2 choh oh ch 3 c oh h 2 o 31 ccl 4 h ccl 3 hcl fig 4e showed that compared with the dbd plasma system without the presence of any scavenger the degradation rate of rhb did not significantly reduce after the addition of ccl4 and c6o4h2 on the contrary the degradation ability of the dbd plasma system was significantly inhibited after the addition of tempo and ipa and the degradation rates of rhb were 72 in each case fig 4f showed that a large amount of tempo can inhibit the degradation of rhb furthermore oh was continuously consumed by tempo thereby reducing the chance of rhb being oxidized it can be seen that oh is the most important free radicals in the dbd system and participates in a variety of reactions in the degradation process 3 7 4 uv vis spectrum the uv vis spectra of rhb under different treatment times are shown in fig 6 the untreated rhb water sample had the strongest absorption peak at 552 nm with the progress of reaction the absorption peak intensity at this wavelength gradually decreased and basically disappeared at 21 min according to a previous work the absorption of rhb was mainly due to the absorption of the large conjugated chromophore and the disappearance of the peak was presumably due to the reason that the large conjugated chromophore was attacked by active substances during the degradation process the destruction of the unsaturated conjugated bond the destruction of the aniline group and the carbonyl group were also the reasons for the disappearance of maximum absorption peak from the physical appearance s perspective the result was the decolorization of rhb from the structural point of view the overall structure of the rhb molecule was destroyed 3 7 5 variation of bod5 cod and toc the variation of bod5 cod and toc in the reaction system is shown in fig 7 the bod5 of the solution increased from 2 38 mg l to 8 73 mg l within 21 min which proved that the macromolecular substances were continuously destroyed and converted into smaller molecular organic substances during the treatment of rhb by the dbd system moreover the biodegradability obviously improved besides the cod was reduced from 72 92 mg l to 22 57 mg l indicating a removal rate of 69 however the toc was reduced from 24 98 mg l to 20 88 mg l with the removal rate of only 16 41 the high removal rate of cod and low removal rate of toc indicated that most of the energy was used to degrade rhb into intermediate smaller molecules during the degradation process the b c of the untreated solution was only 0 0326 which after the 21 min of treatment using dbd system became 0 3867 in industrial wastewater treatment it was generally considered that the b c was greater than 0 3 for the biochemical treatment the dielectric barrier discharge system in this study greatly improved the biochemical properties of rhb dye wastewater due to which it can be used as a pretreatment process or tail water treatment process for wastewater treatment 3 7 6 degradation pathways for rhb an lc ms ms analysis was performed to elucidate the degradation pathways of rhb the detected degradation intermediates of rhb are presented in table 1 based on the lc ms ms analysis a possible pathway for the degradation of rhb is deduced and shown in fig 8 first of all in the process of dbd discharge a cleavage of rhb removed one ethyl group and converted into l1 then l1 was attacked by oh radicals to form two intermediates of l2 and l3 the two ethyl groups connected to the same nitrogen atom may prevent the nitrogen atoms in the diethylamine group from being attacked by free radicals 49 therefore the second separated ethyl group was easily loosened on the same side of rhb eliminating the first ethyl group moreover l4 was the product of n de ethylation in l2 and l3 then l4 was attacked again by oh to convert n de ethylation into rhodamine l5 50 during the reaction of l5 three intermediates l6 l7 and l8 were formed due to the destruction of conjugated chromophore according to some previous studies 51 the ring opening reaction occurred in these intermediates to form a series of monoaromatic hydrocarbons such as phthalic acid and catechol terephthalic acid and hydroquinone m phthalic acid and resorcinol these small molecules eventually became co2 and h2o through the mineralization reaction resulting in the degradation of rhb and the decrease in toc in the solution the degradation process of rhb included n de ethylation destruction of conjugated chromophore carboxylation reaction ring opening reaction and so on 3 8 comparison with other technologies table 2 presents the comparison of different methods for the degradation of rhb it can be seen that photocatalysis can effectively degrade rhb with a degradation efficiency of 92 3 however it took 140 min to achieve this degradation for laser cavitation the degradation efficiency of rhb was only 81 1 after 180 min of treatment pms α mno2 pal and photo fenton can completely degrade rhb but they need a particularly long time to do so in addition to that uv electrofenton degraded only 86 3 of rhb after 60 min of treatment in the present study 90 2 of rhb was degraded after 21 min of treatment in short the dbd plasma process is an effective technology for treating the rhb wastewater 3 9 toxicity assessment through the us epa test program which is an assessment tool based on quantitative structure activity relationship daphia magna lethal concentration 50 lc50 and bioconcentration factor of rhb and its possible degradation products were predicted 25 the toxicity prediction results were shown in fig 9 it can be seen from fig 9a that the lc of rhb is 100 which is at a high level however after dbd system treatment the value of most products was decreased except for l1 and most of the products were at moderate level l6 l7 l2 l3 and low level l4 l5 l8 the bioconcentration factor of rhb and its degradation products were shown in fig 9b the results showed that the bioconcentration factors of the four products were lower than those of rhb and the values of the other half of the degradation products were increased based on the above analysis dbd plasma can reduce the toxicity of rhb wastewater however in order to pose no potential threat to the ecosystem deep mineralization may be required 4 conclusion in this study the dbd plasma system was used to explore the degradation efficiency and degradation mechanism of rhb increasing input power can improve the rhb degradation rate and increasing the liquid flow rate is beneficial to improve thickness and uniformity of the wet wall water falling film in the discharge reaction area thus improving the rhb degradation rate additionally pure oxygen is more suitable for the degradation of dye wastewater besides the main source of liquid ozone is the neutralization reaction in the solution h2o2 is mainly converted into oh to achieve the purpose of degradation and oh plays a very important role in the rhb degradation process meanwhile the amount of cod and toc declined while that of bod5 raised the toxicity of rhb and its possible products is predicted furthermore the degradation process of rhb included n demethylation conjugated chromophore destruction carboxylation reaction ring opening reaction and so on compared with other technologies dbd plasma is an efficient technology for rhb degradation credit authorship contribution

12733,in the present work the degradation pathways and mechanism of rhodamine b rhb using a novel liquid film dielectric barrier discharge dbd plasma reactor were examined moreover the optimization of the performance of dbd was discussed the results showed that the atmosphere of the discharge area and the input power had a significant effect on the removal of rhb after 21 min of treatment using dbd plasma system about 90 2 of rhb was degraded under the following experimental conditions initial rhb concentration of 40 mg l input power of 125 w and initial ph of 6 78 the use of free radical scavengers proved that hydroxyl radicals played a key role in the degradation of rhb in addition the degradation intermediates of rhb were identified using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry and possible degradation pathways were proposed during the degradation of rhb with the extension of treatment time the values of cod bod5 and toc decreased after the treatment using dbd plasma the bod5 cod of rhb solution increased from 0 0326 to 0 3867 and the biodegradability was also observed to have greatly improved the potential toxicity was predicted by us epa test software graphical abstract

introduction with the development of industrialization and modernization water pollution has gradually become a global challenge from the perspective of the types of wastewater industrial wastewater has a wider source than domestic wastewater including pharmaceutical chemical printing and dyeing petrochemical and other industries 1 3 among them dyeing wastewater which poses a huge threat to human health and water quality environment is difficult to be degraded due to its complicated synthetic sources and complex molecular structure 4 therefore the treatment of dyeing wastewater is of worldwide concern previous studies have shown that conventional wastewater treatment methods such as microbiological methods 5 adsorption 6 coagulation 7 and membrane separation 8 cannot effectively treat synthetic dye compounds therefore advanced treatment technologies are required to remove these compounds from wastewaters in recent years advanced oxidation processes aops have attracted widespread attention due to their high processing efficiency fast reaction and wide adaptability 9 they can produce a variety of highly active species to degrade pollutants especially the hydroxyl radicals oh 10 several aops have been studied to efficiently degradate rhb wastewater such as photocatalytic 11 peroxymonosulfate pms 12 fenton like 13 and electro catazone 14 among different types of aops non thermal plasma ntps can operate at lower temperatures room temperature and take less time 15 in addition ntp neither produces secondary pollution nor requires the addition of other chemicals or chemical precursors moreover npt can effectively destroy the structure of dyes in dyeing wastewater and improve the biodegradability of dye wastewater 16 there are many types of discharge reactors such as barrier discharge 17 gliding arc discharge 18 radio frequency discharge 19 and microwave discharge 20 liquid film dielectric barrier discharge dbd is based on the application of an electric field to break down the gas to generate a large number of high energy electrons and ionized gas that is full of active substances moreover dbd promotes the production of more active substances under the chain reaction thereby degrading the pollutants 21 dbd can act on organic pollutants in water through active free radicals h o and oh active substances oh o3 and h2o2 and physical effects ultra violet uv light and shock waves 22 23 it was reported that acid orange 7 could be efficiently removed by dbd 24 besides our previous study examined the degradation of deet under three different discharge models 23 water fall film reactor is considered to be very good at treating organic pollutants due to more energetic electrons reactive substances and uv radiation in the discharge area 25 in the present study a new type of uniaxial sleeve wet wall dbd plasma system was built and oxanthracene dye rhodamine b rhb was taken as the target pollutant firstly the effects of several discharge system parameters on the degradation of rhb were investigated furthermore the effects of solution parameters such as initial solution concentration initial ph value and the concentration of anions on the degradation of rhb were investigated the generation and action mechanism of h2o2 and o3 and the roles of oh and h in the treatment process were analyzed and discussed finally according to the results of liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms total organic carbon toc and ultraviolet visible uv vis spectroscopy the degradation mechanism of rhb and possible intermediate products were analyzed 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials except that isopropanol is guaranteed reagent pure and purchased from merck all reagents including rhb 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 1 piperidinyloxy tempo and other chemical reagents are analytical pure and purchased from aladdin ultrapure water was used for all experiments 2 2 apparatus and methods the dbd setup used in this study is shown in fig 1 the setup mainly consisted of an energy input system a gas source control system an analysis and detection system and a solution circulation reaction system the dbd plasma reactor consisted of a quartz tube outer cylinder diameter 50 mm a quartz inner cylinder diameter 25 mm and a copper electrode diameter 5 mm the reactor caused the reaction solution to form a uniform and slow liquid film on the inner wall of the inner cylinder through overflow and used quartz as a barrier medium to form a discharge area in the inner cylinder by applying a voltage to a stainless steel rod the atmosphere of the discharge area was controlled through the input of different proportions of gas sources whereas the active species excited by the discharge diffused into the wastewater through the mass transfer process to degrade the targeted pollutants the power was controlled by adjusting the voltage of the transformer the volume of treated water was 300 ml while the reaction time was 21 min the samples were taken from the solution after turning the power off and analyzed after pretreatment filtration dilution and the addition of reagents 2 3 analysis methods the concentration of h2o2 was determined by the titanium salt photometric method the specific operation was as follows 2 ml sample solution 4 ml h2so4 3 mol l k2tio c2o4 2 0 05 mol l were mixed together and then allowed to stand for 10 min the absorbance of the treated solution was measured at 400 nm by a uv vis spectrophotometer 26 the degradation products were detected by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms with a c18 column 4 6 mm 150 mm particle size 5 μm the column temperature was 35 c and the mobile phase was a mixture of acetonitrile and phosphate buffer 40 60 at a flow rate of 0 3 ml min for 10 min the liquid phase ozone concentration was determined by the 7685 series ozone monitor of german b c company and the gas phase ozone concentration was determined by iodine titration 27 the specific determination method was that 350 ml water and 20 ml ki 20 were added to the absorption bottle 5 ml h2so4 3 mol l was added after the absorption was completed the ozone concentration was titrated with 1 ml starch solution 0 1 g l and na2s2o3 0 1 mol l after 5 min and then calculated according to eq 1 1 c o 3 v 1 0 1 10 3 2 48 10 3 v 0 mg l where v 0 is the volume of the absorbing liquid l v 1 is the volume of the solution used for calibration ml 48 is the molar mass g mol the total organic carbon toc was determined using a toc analyzer toc 5000a shimadzu japan the removal rate of toc was calculated using eq 2 2 η toc toc 0 toc t toc 0 100 among them η toc is the removal rate of toc in pollutant solution toc 0 is the concentration of toc before treatment mg l and toc t is the concentration of toc in the solution at t time mg l five day biochemical oxygen demand bod5 and chemical oxygen demand cod were determined by multi parameter water quality tester the absorbance of the sample was measured using a uv vis spectrophotometer at 552 nm and the concentration of rhb was calculated according to the standard curve the removal rates of rhb were calculated using eq 3 3 η rhb c 0 c t c 0 100 where η rhb is the degradation rate of rhb c 0 is the concentration of rhb before treatment mg l and c t is the concentration of the reactant after a certain reaction time period t mg l the energy yield is an index to evaluate the quality of pollutants degraded by the unit energy consumed by the system the energy yield of rhb was calculated using the following eq 4 4 γ c 0 v η rhb p input t 10 3 where γ is the energy yield of the system g kw h c 0 is the rhb concentration before the solution is treated mg l v is the volume of the solution participating in the reaction l η rhb is the rhb degradation rate in the reaction time t p input is the input power of the system and t is the reaction time of the system 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of initial concentration of rhb the effect of initial concentration of rhb on its degradation using dbd plasma is illustrated in fig 2 fig 2a showed that the degradation rates within 3 min under the four concentrations of 20 mg l 30 mg l 40 mg l and 50 mg l reached 45 41 36 and 32 respectively moreover after 21 min the degradation rates were 86 90 93 and 96 respectively it can be seen from fig 2b that the energy yield at low initial concentration of rhb was lower than that at higher initial concentration these results indicated that the degradation rate of rhb using dbd plasma system decreased with the increase in the initial concentration of rhb the main reason for this phenomenon was that the rate of reactive species produced by the discharge was stable under certain conditions and the probability of collision and the combination of pollutant molecules and reactive species could be affected by the concentration of the pollutant in addition after the pollutant molecules were oxidized by the reactive species an intermediate was produced the intermediate competed with the pollutant molecules for the reactive species causing the initial concentration to increase and the degradation rate to decrease on the other hand when the initial concentration was low the energy dissipation occurred and only a small part of the energy was used for the degradation of pollutant 28 therefore the energy yield of low concentration is lower than that of high concentration 3 2 effect of initial ph value fig 2c showed the effect of ph value on the degradation of rhb ph was adjusted by naoh 1 mol l and hcl 1 mol l when the ph was 3 5 9 and 11 the degradation rates of rhb within 21 min were 100 100 99 and 100 respectively however the degradation rate of rhb at ph 7 was 94 higher rhb degradation at acidic ph value could been seen by this result and it was attributed to the increased formation and accumulation of h2o2 and oh radicals at acidic ph levels 29 additionally under alkaline levels dissolved o3 molecules were easily decomposed to generate oh which led to the degradation of rhb resulting in a higher degradation rate under alkaline levels than under neutral levels 30 31 3 3 effect of input power the first important factor that impacts the concentration of active species is the input power the effect of input power on the degradation of rhb was investigated and the results are shown in fig 2d as the input power increased the degradation rate of rhb dyes also increased when the input power was 100 w the degradation rate of rhb was 85 the input power was further increased to 125 w 150 w and 175 w the degradation rate of rhb increased to 90 92 and 94 respectively with the increasing of input power from 100 w to 175 w the rate constant k of the system also increased from 0 0899 to 0 1292 min 1 the electric field intensity and discharge density of the reaction area were determined by the discharge power a large amount of active species oh o and o3 and ultraviolet radiation intensity were produced during the discharge process 32 33 as the discharge power increased the electrons gained more energy in the electric field and induced more oxygen and water molecules to ionize through collisions thus resulting in the formation of more active substances and stronger ultraviolet radiation 34 therefore the removal efficiency of rhb increased with the increase in input power with the increase in discharge power the stronger the signal of the emission spectrum the more the formation of the active substances 35 as shown in fig 3f with the increase in degradation rate the energy yield decreased rapidly the reason may be that as the rhb molecules continued to degrade into smaller molecular substances the probability of the rhb molecules in the solution binding to the active substances decreased accordingly 28 3 4 effect of gas discharge atmosphere in the gas phase plasma in contact with the liquid phase the composition of gas affects the type of generated active substances fig 3a showed that when the discharge atmosphere was pure oxygen the rhb was completely degraded in 9 min moreover when the discharge atmosphere consisted of air ar ar o2 8 2 and ar o2 5 5 the degradation rates within 21 min were 92 98 99 and 100 respectively it can be seen from the results that the rate of degradation for the dye in air plasma was relatively low which was caused by the combination of oh and reactive nitrogen species in the air see reaction eq 5 30 5 no 2 oh hno 3 the hydroxyl radical is a very important reactive species in the degradation of pollutants therefore as the proportion of o2 in the discharge atmosphere decreased the degradation rate of rhb decreased 3 5 effect of liquid circulation rate the liquid circulation rate directly determines the thickness and uniformity of the water film in the discharge area the effect of different liquid circulation flowrates on the degradation of rhb is shown in fig 3b when the flow rates of the liquid film were 150 ml min 170 ml min and 190 ml min the degradation rates of rhb dyes at 21 min were 95 97 and 99 respectively when the circulating flow rate of the liquid film was at a low level the short circuit phenomenon will be formed on the inner wall the liquid film did not flow uniformly and formed multiple small trickles which will drastically reduce the surface area of the solution exposed to the discharge area due to this reason the probability of high energy electrons free radicals and other reactive species entering the solution was reduced 28 in addition the energy yield constantly decreased with the progression of the reaction as shown in fig 3e when the flow rate was 190 ml min the energy yield was 1 087 g kw h with the degradation rate of 57 moreover when the degradation rate increased to 99 the energy yield was 0 2717 g kw h the reason for this phenomenon may be that there were a large number of intermediate and pollutant molecules in the solution to compete for active substances on the other hand the heat energy of the system was dissipated 3 6 effect of different anions in practice wastewater often contains a variety of anions such as cl so4 2 no3 and co3 2 which can consume reactive species fig 3c revealed the effect of cl so4 2 no3 and co3 2 on the degradation of rhb the presence of anions in the solution can relatively inhibit the degradation process this could be due to the following reactions occurring in the solution eqs 6 7 36 6 oh so 4 2 h so 4 h 2 o 7 oh cl h cl h 2 o as shown in reaction 6 cl and oh produce cl the redox potential of cl 1 36 v is lower than oh 2 80 v therefore the presence of cl in the solution inhibited the degradation process as shown in reaction 7 so4 was formed by this reaction and the redox potential of so4 2 50 v is higher than cl 1 36 v the inhibitory effect of cl on rhb is greater than that of so4 2 8 no 3 hv no 2 o 9 no 3 hv h 2 o no 2 oh oh 10 o h 2 o 2 oh in the process of dbd plasma ultraviolet radiation plays an important role in the degradation of pollutants 37 no3 inhibited some reactions catalyzed by ultraviolet radiation eq 8 thus reducing the formation of oh on the other hand it can also form oh through certain other reactions eqs 9 10 38 therefore no3 does not significantly affect the degradation of rhb it is well known that co3 2 is a strong hydroxyl radical scavenger and its product can continue to combine with oh thus consistently consuming oh in the solution eqs 11 13 38 it can be seen in fig 3d that when the concentration of co3 2 in the solution became higher the degradation of rhb began to deteriorate 11 co 3 2 oh co 3 oh 12 h 2 o co 3 2 oh hco 3 13 hco 3 oh co 3 oh 3 7 degradation mechanism and analysis of active components 3 7 1 role of o3 in the degradation of rhb some studies have pointed out that ozone will be formed through two steps in the discharge zone 39 firstly o2 molecules are excited into o radicals followed by a three body reaction to generate o3 molecules then the o3 molecules are diffused and dissolved into the solution the reactions are represented by eqs 14 16 40 14 e o 2 2o e 15 o o 2 m o 3 gas m 16 o 3 gas o 3 aq fig 4 showed the concentration of o3 of liquid ozone and gas phase ozone produced by the dbd plasma system under different discharge atmospheres it can be seen that when the discharge atmosphere was ar there were no o2 molecules in the gas therefore the gas phase ozone concentration could not be detected the cumulative concentration of 0 04 mg l was presumed to be due to insufficient air tightness of the device and a small amount of air was ionized when the proportion of o2 in the discharge atmosphere was further increased to ar o2 8 2 the cumulative gas phase ozone concentration increased by 2 82 mg l however the cumulative gas phase ozone concentration in the air atmosphere was 1 34 mg l previous studies indicated that the following reactions exist in gas eqs 17 20 41 42 17 n 2 e 2 n e 18 n o no 19 no o no 2 20 no o 3 o 2 no 2 argon molecules were excited under the influence of electric field to form ar and excited electrons then the ar reacted with h2o molecules to generate oh radicals eqs 21 22 43 21 ar ar e 22 ar 2h 2 o h 3 o ar oh therefore when n2 existed in the gas it will not only snatch a part of high energy electrons but also generate no which reacted with o3 and resulted in a decrease in the gas phase ozone concentration furthermore the ratio of ar to o2 was ar o2 5 5 and the gas phase ozone concentration reached 4 14 mg l which was due to the increase in the content of o2 molecules it was interesting to notice that when the cumulative concentration of liquid ozone in air ar and aro2 was compared the variation pattern of the liquid ozone concentration was inconsistent with the cumulative concentration of gas phase ozone among the known way gas phase ozone diffused into the solution through gas liquid mass transfer thereby increasing the cumulative concentration of ozone in the liquid phase however the cumulative concentrations of ozone in the liquid phase under ar and ar o2 8 2 atmosphere were 0 89 mg l and 0 98 mg l respectively combined with the results reported in some previous studies 44 the generation mechanism of liquid phase ozone in dbd plasma system was deduced and is shown in fig 5 in addition to gas liquid diffusion there were more important ways to produce ozone eq 23 23 o 2 oh h o 3 the source of liquid ozone generation was mainly based on this reaction it can be seen that the hydroxyl radical was closely related to the concentration of ozone eqs 24 25 35 24 o 3 o o 2 25 o h 2 o 2 oh 3 7 2 role of h2o2 in the degradation of rhb among the active species produced by dbd plasma system the residence time of h2o2 is relatively long in order to study whether h2o2 contributes to the degradation of rhb or not the content of h2o2 under different experimental conditions was tested and the results are shown in fig 4 when the power was 125 w 150 w and 175 w the cumulative concentrations of h2o2 in the water solution were 3 77 mg l 4 59 mg l and 6 15 mg l at 21 min respectively when the power was increased the dbd system generated more high energy electrons oh o3 and h2o2 in the solution some studies have reported that the principle of h2o2 generation in the solution follows the reaction eq 26 45 26 oh oh h 2 o 2 meanwhile when h2o2 was added to the system the overall degradation rate of the pollutant within the concentration range of 0 2 0 8 mg l and 10 min changed insignificantly when the added amounts of h2o2 were changed through values of 1 ml 2 ml and 3 ml the pollutant degradation rate changed to values of 51 55 and 61 respectively indicating that the degradation rate of rhb increased significantly hydrogen peroxide h2o2 can directly or indirectly participate in the removal of rhb however the oxidation potential of h2o2 is low due to which its contribution to the degradation process of the pollutant is small it is generally believed that in the dbd system h2o2 achieved the purpose of degrading rhb through electron collision reaction with o3 and ultraviolet decomposition these phenomena are represented by the reaction eqs 27 29 22 46 27 e h 2 o 2 oh oh 28 h 2 o 2 o 3 ho 2 o 2 oh 29 h 2 o 2 hv oh oh 3 7 3 effect of different radical scavengers on the degradation of rhb the radical scavenging experiments were carried out to explore the role of radicals on the degradation of rhb in the dbd plasma system in this experiment isopropanol ipa and tempo were used as the oh scavengers and ccl4 was used to remove h furthermore c6o4h2 was used to remove o2 47 some radical scavengers can capture radicals in the reaction process through reaction eqs 30 31 48 30 ch 3 2 choh oh ch 3 c oh h 2 o 31 ccl 4 h ccl 3 hcl fig 4e showed that compared with the dbd plasma system without the presence of any scavenger the degradation rate of rhb did not significantly reduce after the addition of ccl4 and c6o4h2 on the contrary the degradation ability of the dbd plasma system was significantly inhibited after the addition of tempo and ipa and the degradation rates of rhb were 72 in each case fig 4f showed that a large amount of tempo can inhibit the degradation of rhb furthermore oh was continuously consumed by tempo thereby reducing the chance of rhb being oxidized it can be seen that oh is the most important free radicals in the dbd system and participates in a variety of reactions in the degradation process 3 7 4 uv vis spectrum the uv vis spectra of rhb under different treatment times are shown in fig 6 the untreated rhb water sample had the strongest absorption peak at 552 nm with the progress of reaction the absorption peak intensity at this wavelength gradually decreased and basically disappeared at 21 min according to a previous work the absorption of rhb was mainly due to the absorption of the large conjugated chromophore and the disappearance of the peak was presumably due to the reason that the large conjugated chromophore was attacked by active substances during the degradation process the destruction of the unsaturated conjugated bond the destruction of the aniline group and the carbonyl group were also the reasons for the disappearance of maximum absorption peak from the physical appearance s perspective the result was the decolorization of rhb from the structural point of view the overall structure of the rhb molecule was destroyed 3 7 5 variation of bod5 cod and toc the variation of bod5 cod and toc in the reaction system is shown in fig 7 the bod5 of the solution increased from 2 38 mg l to 8 73 mg l within 21 min which proved that the macromolecular substances were continuously destroyed and converted into smaller molecular organic substances during the treatment of rhb by the dbd system moreover the biodegradability obviously improved besides the cod was reduced from 72 92 mg l to 22 57 mg l indicating a removal rate of 69 however the toc was reduced from 24 98 mg l to 20 88 mg l with the removal rate of only 16 41 the high removal rate of cod and low removal rate of toc indicated that most of the energy was used to degrade rhb into intermediate smaller molecules during the degradation process the b c of the untreated solution was only 0 0326 which after the 21 min of treatment using dbd system became 0 3867 in industrial wastewater treatment it was generally considered that the b c was greater than 0 3 for the biochemical treatment the dielectric barrier discharge system in this study greatly improved the biochemical properties of rhb dye wastewater due to which it can be used as a pretreatment process or tail water treatment process for wastewater treatment 3 7 6 degradation pathways for rhb an lc ms ms analysis was performed to elucidate the degradation pathways of rhb the detected degradation intermediates of rhb are presented in table 1 based on the lc ms ms analysis a possible pathway for the degradation of rhb is deduced and shown in fig 8 first of all in the process of dbd discharge a cleavage of rhb removed one ethyl group and converted into l1 then l1 was attacked by oh radicals to form two intermediates of l2 and l3 the two ethyl groups connected to the same nitrogen atom may prevent the nitrogen atoms in the diethylamine group from being attacked by free radicals 49 therefore the second separated ethyl group was easily loosened on the same side of rhb eliminating the first ethyl group moreover l4 was the product of n de ethylation in l2 and l3 then l4 was attacked again by oh to convert n de ethylation into rhodamine l5 50 during the reaction of l5 three intermediates l6 l7 and l8 were formed due to the destruction of conjugated chromophore according to some previous studies 51 the ring opening reaction occurred in these intermediates to form a series of monoaromatic hydrocarbons such as phthalic acid and catechol terephthalic acid and hydroquinone m phthalic acid and resorcinol these small molecules eventually became co2 and h2o through the mineralization reaction resulting in the degradation of rhb and the decrease in toc in the solution the degradation process of rhb included n de ethylation destruction of conjugated chromophore carboxylation reaction ring opening reaction and so on 3 8 comparison with other technologies table 2 presents the comparison of different methods for the degradation of rhb it can be seen that photocatalysis can effectively degrade rhb with a degradation efficiency of 92 3 however it took 140 min to achieve this degradation for laser cavitation the degradation efficiency of rhb was only 81 1 after 180 min of treatment pms α mno2 pal and photo fenton can completely degrade rhb but they need a particularly long time to do so in addition to that uv electrofenton degraded only 86 3 of rhb after 60 min of treatment in the present study 90 2 of rhb was degraded after 21 min of treatment in short the dbd plasma process is an effective technology for treating the rhb wastewater 3 9 toxicity assessment through the us epa test program which is an assessment tool based on quantitative structure activity relationship daphia magna lethal concentration 50 lc50 and bioconcentration factor of rhb and its possible degradation products were predicted 25 the toxicity prediction results were shown in fig 9 it can be seen from fig 9a that the lc of rhb is 100 which is at a high level however after dbd system treatment the value of most products was decreased except for l1 and most of the products were at moderate level l6 l7 l2 l3 and low level l4 l5 l8 the bioconcentration factor of rhb and its degradation products were shown in fig 9b the results showed that the bioconcentration factors of the four products were lower than those of rhb and the values of the other half of the degradation products were increased based on the above analysis dbd plasma can reduce the toxicity of rhb wastewater however in order to pose no potential threat to the ecosystem deep mineralization may be required 4 conclusion in this study the dbd plasma system was used to explore the degradation efficiency and degradation mechanism of rhb increasing input power can improve the rhb degradation rate and increasing the liquid flow rate is beneficial to improve thickness and uniformity of the wet wall water falling film in the discharge reaction area thus improving the rhb degradation rate additionally pure oxygen is more suitable for the degradation of dye wastewater besides the main source of liquid ozone is the neutralization reaction in the solution h2o2 is mainly converted into oh to achieve the purpose of degradation and oh plays a very important role in the rhb degradation process meanwhile the amount of cod and toc declined while that of bod5 raised the toxicity of rhb and its possible products is predicted furthermore the degradation process of rhb included n demethylation conjugated chromophore destruction carboxylation reaction ring opening reaction and so on compared with other technologies dbd plasma is an efficient technology for rhb degradation credit authorship contribution

12734,this work studies the valorisation of the concentrates obtained through membrane processes for the purification of olive oil washing wastewater ooww the adsorption with resins desorption process followed by a biological treatment with sequencing batch reactor sbrs three different wastewater samples were treated an ultrafiltration reject stream uf r with a high organic load and low content of phenolic compounds a nanofiltration reject stream nf r which rich in phenolic compounds and with medium organic load a stream concentrated by forward osmosis fo c with high organic content and concentration of phenolic compounds through the adsorption desorption process it was possible to recover 90 and 73 which corresponds to 1 69 and 1 66 g l 1 of the total phenolic compounds reject streams of nf r and fo c respectively with the sbrs it was possible to eliminate around 80 of the organic matter present in the effluent of adsorption and also 90 of the remaining phenolic compounds in the case of uf r the results obtained are promising since on the one hand a high recovery of phenolic compounds was achieved and on the other hand a large part of the organic matter of the remaining streams after adsorption was eliminated in this way a solution for the management of the membrane reject streams is proposed allowing a circular economy in the wastewater treatment of olive oil processing keywords adsorption desorption olive mill wastewater phenolic compounds recovery sequencing batch reactor data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the world production of virgin olive oil has tripled in the last years the member countries of the international olive council ioc produced 93 3 of the world total olive oil production in the 2020 21 campaign with spain 49 being the main producer followed by greece 9 8 italy 9 7 and portugal 4 9 1 this production generates large quantities of liquid effluents called oil mill wastewaters omw whose production in the mediterranean countries fluctuates between 7 106 and 30 106 m3 2 a high organic load a slightly acidic ph low alkalinity low nitrogen content and the presence of lipid fractions and phytotoxic compounds generally characterize these wastewaters these characteristics generate a toxic effect for microorganisms making their treatment difficult 3 over the last few years this wastewater has gone from a waste to a co product of the olive industry all this because it is an outstanding source of antioxidant components phenolic compounds 4 various processes have been proposed for the recovery of phenolic compounds from these sources such as adsorption 5 liquid liquid extraction 6 cloud point extraction 7 cooling crystallization 8 solar distillation 9 and hybrid processes 10 in addition many studies have been reported in which phenolic solutes were successfully recovered using integrated membrane systems in some studies 11 the phenolic fraction is concentrated in the reject streams by means of forward osmosis fo to later fractionate it with ultrafiltration uf and nanofiltration nf other studies 12 used a sequence of microfiltration mf followed by nf membranes and by osmotic distillation od or vacuum membrane distillation vmd although these hybrid membrane processes have been extensively studied for the recovery of phenolic compounds all of them produce a reject stream which is mainly formed by organic matter though phenolic compounds are also present the idea of working with sequential membrane processes is to obtain permeates and or concentrated streams that contain high phenolic compounds concentrations for their further valorisation however there is few information about the management of the streams that are not of interest generally the reject currents considering them as waste in some studies it has been suggested that that they could be used as fertilizers or for biogas production 13 14 nonetheless these currents were not the focus of attention concentrating most of the research only on the recovery of phenolic compounds the adsorption desorption process has been widely studied and used the study of different materials for the adsorption of pollutants is a strong point some of the materials considered are rice husk nanosilica 15 16 activated carbon 17 crude olives stone 18 and polymeric resins 19 although the utilization of bio sorbents from agricultural by products presents some advantages their utilization in the adsorption of phenolic compounds from omw has not offered good results until now 20 among the most used materials currently applied for phenolic compounds resins occupy an important position various studies have shown the great affinity between some resins and phenolic compounds producing effluent from the treatment having a great purity on the other hand their easy recovery and reuse together with low cost and low for the environment make them appropriate technologies for the recovery of these antioxidant compounds on the other hand their easy recovery and reuse together with low cost and low environmental impact make them appropriate technologies for the recovery of these antioxidant compounds 21 22 after the recovery of these compounds the remaining streams which are concentrated in other organic compounds become residues that have to be treated to reduce their organic load 23 in membrane processes there is always a reject current which is mainly formed by organic matter like suspended or colloidal matter biological treatment is an option that offers several advantages such as allowing the removal of organic compounds in an economical space saving and environmentally friendly way without the addition of any chemical reagent 24 an interesting study was carried out by conidi et al 25 where omw was treated with a hybrid membrane process that contemplated first stages of mf and uf followed by two biocatalytic membrane reactors mbmr for the conversion of oleuropein into the isomer of the oleuropein aglycone in this study both the mf and uf rejection currents were recycled to the process feed and no data about the management of the withdrawals from the systems were reported to date no work has been found that presents the recover of all the currents generated in the hybrid membrane processes to sum up through some membrane processes concentrated streams with high purity of phenolic compounds and permeates with characteristics to be reincorporated into the process are obtained 26 however after other treatments proposed in the literature there are residual streams with a high contaminant load either after recovering extracting the phenolic compounds or simply discarded streams during the process in this work the recovery by adsorption of phenolic compounds from reject streams of membrane processes of omw treatment was studied as well as the management of the remaining streams the water samples corresponded to the rejections obtained from uf and nf processes and to the concentrated stream coming from a fo process these streams were further treated by a sbr and the effects of the different pre treatments on the biodegradation were investigated 2 materials and methods 2 1 feed samples characterization the samples corresponded to reject concentrated streams from different membrane processes uf nf and fo fig 1 shows a diagram in which the origin of the different waters to be treated can be seen adsorption is highlighted in pink whereas sbr in green color the figure presents two different hybrid processes proposed for the recovery of phenolic compounds the initial raw samples corresponded to olive oil washing wastewaters ooww and were provided by an olive oil milling plant located in the valencian community spain the raw water was subjected to pre treatment following the protocol presented in previous studies 23 including flotation sedimentation and cartridge filtration the concentrate obtained in the fo process fo c and the reject stream from the nf process nf r were subjected to the adsorption process with resins prior to biological treatment to recover the phenolic compounds in addition the reject stream from the uf process uf r was treated directly with the sbr due to the lower concentration of phenolic compounds table 1 shows the average values of the main parameters measured in the different wastewater samples before the proposed treatment 2 2 adsorption desorption process the resin used was macronet s mn200 supplied by purolite which was selected based on a previous study where the adsorption desorption process was optimized 27 the resin is moderately hydrophobic whit a polystyrene crosslinked with divinylbenzene matrix with a surface area of 1100 m2 g and a pore diameter of 700 15 å macropores micropores the resin was conditioned for 60 min at 140 rpm in a 2 w v solution of sodium hydroxide before being used then the nf r and fo c samples were mixed with a dosage of 40 g l of resin for 180 min at a constant speed of 140 rpm after the working time the liquid fraction was separated by means of a 0 2 μm filter to analyse removal efficiency the resins were washed three times with osmotized water and then subjected to desorption with a 50 v v ethanol water solution under the same conditions used for adsorption 180 min at a constant speed of 140 rpm the supernatant was analysed to measure concentration of cod tphc and sug and calculate the recovery rates the adsorption removal and desorption recovery were calculated with the following equations 1 removal c 0 c e c 0 100 2 recovery c d v d c 0 c e v 0 100 where c 0 and ce are the initial and equilibrium concentrations respectively in terms of cod tphc and sug c d is the concentration in the desorption solution v d and v 0 correspond to the volume in ml of the desorption solution ethanol water 50 and of the initial sample volume respectively adsorption kinetics were studied through two models the pseudo first 28 and pseudo second 29 order reaction which were used to fit the experimental data under the following equations respectively 3 ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t 4 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 1 q e t where the amount of solute adsorbed per gram of adsorbent at equilibrium is represented by qe mg g 1 whereas qt mg g 1 is the concentration of adsorbate in solid phase at time t min k1 min 1 and k2 g mg 1 min 1 represent the pseudo first order and the pseudo second order rate constant respectively these constants were determined by linear regression of two plotted graphs ln qe qt versus time t for the pseudo first order and t qt versus time t for the pseudo second order the intra particle diffusion model also known as weber s diffusion model was used for the identification of the mechanism involved in the adsorption process the adsorption of phenolic compounds is controlled by different steps which can be related to film or external surface diffusion pore diffusion surface diffusion and adsorption on the pore surface or a combination of them 30 the followed eq 5 represents the weber s diffusion model 5 q t k d 1 2 i where k d mg g 1 min ½ is the intra particle diffusion rate constant and i represents the thickness of the boundary layer on the adsorbent surface both parameters were obtained by a linear plot of qt versus t ½ 2 3 biological treatment after the removal of phenolic compounds uf r and nf r and fo c samples were subjected to biological treatment using the following protocol 2 3 1 experiment 1 due to the high organic load present in the wastewater samples a preliminary study in batch mode was carried out the main objective was to find a concentration at which the bacteria were not affected different concentrations of each sample in tap water 5 10 15 20 and 30 v v were mixed with biomass taken from an activated sludge reactor of a municipal wastewater treatment plant in beakers the operation time was 24 h and agitation and aeration were continuous the operating conditions were the same for all the tests maintaining mixed liquor suspended solids mlss of 3 5 g l 1 a feed volume of 0 25 l and a food to microorganism ratio f m of 0 15 gcod gmlss 1 d 1 the required sludge volume was calculated based on the percentage cod concentration of wastewater in the feed as mentioned above the purpose of this study was to determine the concentration of each type of wastewater in percentage that would be appropriate as the initial feed to a biological reactor then once the bacteria have adapted the concentration of wastewater in the feed diluted with tap water was progressively increased to reach the maximum concentrations as possible in addition a biodegradability analysis by a respirometric test was carried out to determinate the toxicity of each sample the test was performed following the protocol presented by zuriaga agustí et al 31 it was carried out by adding different doses 10 ml as first dose and 5 ml for the rest of the doses of wastewater to a 500 ml of mixed liquor sample in order to measure the influence of the sample addition on the standard oxygen uptake rate 2 3 2 experiment 2 once the starting concentration was selected three laboratory reactors named as sbr uf r sbr nf r and sbr fo c volume of reaction 6 l in each reactor were operated as sequencing batch reactors sbr for 65 days the reactors were seeded with activated sludge from a municipal wastewater treatment plant valencia spain and fed with the above mentioned samples dipotassium phosphate and urea both reagents supplied by panreac spain were added to each feed solution to adjust the phosphorous and nitrogen concentrations to obtain a cod n p relationship of 100 5 1 32 the sbrs were operated setting 1 cycle per day with five phases per cycle filling 10 min reaction 1 h 21 h anaerobic aerobic sedimentation 1 5 h draw 10 min and idle 10 min the initial feeding volume ml day was 900 for the sbr fed with fo c and nf r samples and 600 for the sbr uf r the feed volume and consequently the withdrawn volume of treated wastewater was increased gradually during the experiment in fact the feed volume increased a 5 every 10 or 15 days depending on the reactor therefore the hydraulic retention times hrt and the volume exchange ratio ver which is the quotient between the feed volume and the reaction volume were variable during the operation of the reactors being also different for each reactor 2 3 3 analytical methodology of the mixed liquor in both experiments cod mlss total nitrogen tn total phosphorous tp and total phenolic compounds tphc for sbr uf r were measured the cell lysis was studied through dna analysis and the dissolved oxygen concentration do was monitored throughout the process by using standard probes in experiment 1 the parameters were measured at 3 h 6 h and at the end of the test 24 h in experiment 2 these parameters were analysed every two days in each reactor in both tests the removal efficiency r of cod and tphc for sbr uf r was calculated for each reactor by the following equation 6 r c in c ef c in 100 where cin and cef correspond to the concentration mg l 1 of cod or tphc measured in the feed and the sbr effluent experiment 2 or dissolved in the beaker experiment 1 respectively the cod tp tn and the other nitrogen forms were measured by kits merck using a dr600 spectrophotometer hach lange mlss concentrations were measured according to apha 33 tphc mgtyeq l 1 was measured according to singleton et al 34 following the folin ciocalteau method whereas sugars were analysed with sucrose d glucose d fructose colorimetric kit from r biopharm germany using glucose panreac spain as a standard dna was determined by fastdna spin kit mp biomedicals usaatpc following the protocol presented in ferrer polonio et al 35 in experiment 2 atpc adenosine triphosphate from living cells avss active viable solids and bsi bacterial stress index were determined at the end of each stage following the protocol also presented in the above mentioned paper 35 the results of total and dissolved atp were obtained from photonmaster luminometer luminultra in rlu related luminescence units for then being converted to ngatp ml using a standard atp solution ultracheck and lumicapture lite software 3 results 3 1 adsorption desorption table 2 shows the results obtained in the adsorption desorption of phenolic compounds from nf r and fo c samples with the mn200 resin the great affinity of the resin with phenolic compounds can be clearly seen which is reflected in high adsorption percentages 90 this is mainly due to the properties of the resin since the hypercrosslinked polystyrene material gives the surface of the resin the characteristic of being very hydrophobic thus having a great affinity for adsorbates with phenyl groups 36 37 since it has been reported that the presence of other substances present in omw can interfere with the adsorption of phenolic compounds 38 as these substances are able to cause inhibitory effects and reduce the elimination of contaminants the adsorption of cod and sugars has been studied the low adsorption of sugars was also expected since it was observed in a previous study performed by the authors 27 where the low affinity of the mn200 resin for sugars was demostrated the high selectivity for phenolic compounds was one of the reasons considered to selected this resin this behaviour is explained because polymeric styrene based adsorbents have a high specificity for hydrophobic substances such as phenolic compounds showing little interaction with sugars 39 40 this is due to the more favorable interactions between a polymer styrene dvb with aromatic adsorbent species and a hydrophobic substance in comparison with sugars this causes the inhibition of sugars adsorption due to the competitiveness with phenolic compounds adsorption 41 phenolic compounds resin interactions could be of the pi pi type and or hydrogen bonds and occur between the benzene rings in the polymer and the adsorbent aromatic species 42 the highest removal of tphc and the lowest removal of sugars occurred in the nf r sample this may be due to the fact that compared to the fo c sample the nf feed was preceded by an uf process which removed a considerable concentration of organic matter organic matter could compete with the phenolic compounds for the adsorption sites in addition to generate a rapid clogging of the resin reducing the adsorption of specific species 43 another way to justify the better performance of the process for nf r is by calculating the cod related to the total phenolic compounds through the analysis presented by ferrer polonio et al 44 it is possible to calculate theoretically the cod associated to the tphc in mgty l 1 using eq 7 7 cod tphc ads c 0 tphc c e tphc 2 2 where 2 2 corresponds to the mg of o2 needed to oxidate one mg of tyrosol following the same analysis the cod associated to the sugars has been calculated using eq 8 considering that 1 g of glucose is equivalent to 1 1 g of cod 8 cod sug ads c 0 sug c e sug 1 1 the difference between the initial concentration c0 and the equilibrium concentration ce corresponds to the total of tphc or sug adsorbed it can be seen that the percentage of cod that represents the adsorbed phenolic compounds is higher for the nf r sample this trend was also observed for recovery as the solution obtained after desorption presented a higher codtphc cod ratio in the case of the nf r sample this is due to the presence of a large amount of high and low molecular weight compounds such as saccharides amino acids and macromolecules in the fo c sample which could affect the sorption of phenolic compounds 45 however as a result of the ultrafiltration pretreatment see fig 1 the nf r had lower organic content than the fo c these results can relate the pre treatment of the ooww to the phenolic compopunds purity in the final concentrated sample obtained regarding the kinetics of the adsorption process the values obtained after fitting the data to pseudo first and pseudo second order reactions are presented in table 3 it can be seen that the q e obtained with the pseudo first order model gives a very low value compared to the experimental one q e ex on the other hand the pseudo second order model gives an r2 closer to one which better fitting of the experimental data this implies that the adsorption rate depends more on the adsorption capacity of the resin and not on the adsorbate concentration 46 in fig 2 the representation of the intra particle diffusion model is presented a non linearity of the data is observed in fact two trends are clearly seen for both adsorption processes this implies that not only intra particle diffusion controls the process but more than one process affected adsorption 46 the first adsorption step controls up to 4 min1 2 a positive value of the intercept of this first stage can be interpreted as a very fast kinetic process which is responsible for a fast inter particle adsorption of the phenolic compounds on the resin in the initial stage of the kinetic isotherm then the passage from one trend to the other is generally attributed to boundary layer diffusion effects or external mass transfer effects finally the second stage is governed by intra particle diffusion 30 44 47 similar results were obtained by other authors studying the phenolic compounds adsorption with mn200 resin such is the case of the study carried out by valderrama et al 48 who attributed this trend to the sorption stages of the external inter particle diffusion fist stage and internal intra particle diffusion fist stage surfaces and to the equilibrium approach respectively these authors explained that the fast adsorption speed of the first section is due to the sorption in the macroporous structure then the molecules diffuse towards the microporous structure to finally be adsorbed by the surface of the adsorbent particles in the present work the resistance to diffusion increased from the first to the second stage this could explain the decrease observed in the value of kd which changed from 12 61 to 0 48 mgg 1 min 1 2 for the nf r and from 6 03 to 1 32 mgg 1 min 1 2 for the fo c it has to be highlighted that it was possible to remove almost all the phenolic compounds presented in the water samples 96 42 and 92 78 from the nf r and fo c samples respectively this is important to ensure a better treatment in the following biological step since microbial bioconversion can be inhibited due to the toxic and biostatic effects of phenolic compounds 49 in addition a concentrated solution rich in phenolic compounds of the order of 1 7 g l 1 was achieved corresponding to 90 and 73 of the initial total phenolic compounds present in the nf r and fo c water samples respectively an issue to consider in adsorption desorption processes is both the recovery and reuse of the adsorbents in this case it was possible to recover the resin by means of 3 washes with water 5 min at 150 rpm followed by drying in an oven for 3 h at 50 c regarding their reuse it was possible to use the same resins in 4 adsorption desorption cycles without losing their efficiency other studies 44 have reported that after 10 cycles of reuse these resins begin to be affected in terms of their efficiency these authors observed a decrease of 0 9 in the adsorption capacity of phenolic compounds and 8 5 in the desorption percentage when working with ultrafiltered fermentation brines from table olive processing ftop it is important to note that these results were obtained with the permeate from an ultrafiltration process thus the stream is comparable to nf r these authors observed greater decrease in the efficiency 7 9 and 12 1 for the adsorption and desorption capacities respectively when the ftop filtered at 60 μm was directly submitted to an adsorption desorption process therefore both the pretreatment and the characteristics of the wastewater to be treated are key points for resin reuse in summary through the adsorption process the removal of phenolic compounds from nf r and fo c was achieved this implies the recovery of valuable compounds on the one hand as well as the removal of phytotoxic compounds prior to a biological treatment on the other hand 3 2 biological treatment preliminary study the preliminary study was performed in order to obtain information about the biodegradability of the samples and to select the initial feed volume of each sbr operated in the experiment 2 it can be seen in fig 3 that the water samples without phenolic compounds fo c and nf r are more easily degradable by microorganisms as the organic matter was consumed in less time greater decrease in cod thus 50 of the organic matter for the concentrations of 5 10 and 15 for the fo c sample was eliminated in 24 h at concentrations of 20 and 30 the elimination after 24 h droped to 33 approximately for the nf r sample the organic matter removal increased up to 75 for concentrations 15 above this concentration organic matter removal decreased to an average value of 53 the soluble cod values did not present a great variation from 6 to 24 h which was more noticeable for the concentrations of 5 and 10 in both samples this implies that there is no more readily biodegradable organic matter that could be consumed by organisms this is also evidenced by the mlss values once microorganisms have consumed all the readily biodegradable organic compounds they pass to an endogenous respiration phase in which cell lysis is generated this produced a decrease of the mlss concentration from 3 37 0 14 g l 1 to 2 58 0 40 g l 1 for fo c and from 3 51 0 10 g l 1 to 3 06 0 30 g l 1 for nf r mean value in addition an increase of the dissolved oxygen at 24 h was detected reflecting that organic matter degradation has slowed down a different behaviour was observed for the uf r sample the cod decreased only 43 5 average value for 5 and 10 concentrations respectively then the increase in the concentration of the sample caused the cod removal to be reduced to 24 4 the high concentration of tphc and their antimicrobial characteristics explains the slower degradation and possible cell lysis in other words inhibition of biomass occured other authors also reported the antimicrobial characteristics of phenolic compounds 50 53 this can be observed by the decrease in mlss concentration more pronounced when the percentage of wastewater in the feed was higher to confirm the cell lysis a dna test fig 4 was performed it was observed how the dna in the uf r samples increased considerably compared to the other samples likewise the elimination of tphc in the sample was assessed in the uf r sample in table 4 it can be seen that the removal percentages at 24 h were around 21 41 these values are high taking into account the toxicity of these compounds and the conditions of the batch tests section 2 3 1 however the possible elimination of phenolic compounds from the sample by adsorption in the biomass must also be taken into account the highest reduction percentages were observed for sample concentrations of 5 and 10 similar results were seen in a study with pleurotus ostreatus grown in sbr with an omw model solution 54 these authors observed that the removal of phenolic compounds from the fermentation medium was higher in the omw with low phenolic content compared to those with high phenolic content respirometry tests fig 5 confirmed what was expected after batch tests this assay is based on the measurement of the rate of oxygen consumption by the bacteria when they degrade the different samples it can be seen how the fo c and nf r samples show a similar trend slowly decreasing the respiration rate the tests show that there was negligible toxic impact on the activated sludge as almost the same maximum respiration rate rs was achieved after the addition of each sample dose on the other hand a completely different behaviour can be observed for the uf r sample compared to the other two wastewaters analysed the symptoms of toxicity are evident observing a drastic decrease in rs which implies that this sample was more toxic for the microorganisms the results were consistent with those obtained in experiment 1 although several compounds present in omw contribute to its toxicity 55 this was attributed to the presence of phenolic compounds since the samples have similar characteristics only differing in the concentration of these compounds as previusly commented and reported by other authors it is known that phenolic compounds are characterized by having intense phytotoxic and antimicrobial properties 56 therefore their presence would limit the biodegradation of the different wastewater samples studied considering the results explained above it was decided to start the tests of the experiment 2 with a concentration of 15 of nf r cod of 2 71 g l 1 and fo c cod of 4 21 g l 1 in the feeds to sbr nf r and sbr fo c and with a concentration of 10 of the uf r cod of 3 30 g l 1 in the feed to sbr uf r 3 3 biological treatment sbr performance 3 3 1 cod mlss and tphc removal fig 6 shows the mlss growth rates together with the cod removal efficiencies for the sbrs the dashed lines indicate the increments of the feed wastewater sample volume delimiting different operation stages it can be observed that microorganisms better adapted to the water samples without phenolic compounds sbr fo c and sbr nf r since in these reactors cod removal efficiencies reached values above 80 it led to increase the feed volume sample by 5 every 10 days which determined an increase of ver up to 0 01 at each stage in the first ten days the sbr fo c and the sbr nf r reactors reached an average cod removal efficiency of 84 0 3 and 86 0 7 corresponding to a cod concentration in the effluent of 440 9 mg l 1 and 280 15 8 mg l 1 respectively in stage 2 sbr fo c showed an increase in the removal of organic matter above to 92 this behaviour remained stable until the fourth stage achieving an average removal rate of 89 4 similar results were presented by farabegoli et al 57 treating diluted omw with sbr they observed that from the first stage dilution 1 50 cod close to 1 3 g l 1 to the second one dilution 1 25 cod close to 2 4 g l 1 the cod removal increased from 75 to 90 average values they attributed it to the fact that in the first stage the elimination kinetics were slower depending strictly on the concentration of the substrate on the other hand by having less substrate availability the biomass could pass into a state of endogenous respiration producing a partial mineralization in the second stage once biomass has been acclimated the rate of organic matter removal increases after this period the cod removal efficiency fell to 85 2 in the fifth stage this could be due to the fact that the microorganisms would be affected by the increase in food which leads to an increase of the food to microorganisms ratio a high f m ratio can result in an excess of substrate in the effluent if biodegradable organic matter exceeds biomass consumption capacity 58 therefore the cod level in the effluent would increase on the other hand analyzing the results it can be observed that in the fifth stage there was a low growth of mlss which therefore means that there was not enough bacteria in the systems to dispose of the organic matter it has been reported that maintaining an adequate concentration of mlvss and mlss is necessary to prevent overloading the process and make sure that the biomass bacterial population is sufficient for the biological reaction to take place during aerobic degradation 59 regarding the sbr nf r the cod elimination was stable until the fifth stage with an average value of 92 2 then it decreased to 84 and finally in the last stage it managed to achieve an elimination of 89 3 in this reactor the increase in feed volume did not corresponded to a significant decrease in cod removal efficiency finally it should be noted that the low fluctuation in the cod removal efficiencies presented by sbr fo c and sbr nf r was due to the adaptation of the microorganisms to the medium the high values observed for cod removal percentages which remained relatively stable implied that the sludge microbial community was well adapted to the new environment other studies also indicated that the good performance of the sbr in terms of high cod elimination could be related to an adaptability of the biomass to the environment 51 59 60 the behaviour presented by the sbr uf r was very different from the other two sbrs after a first stage of 15 days for acclimation to the initial wastewater feed volume it was possible to increase the feed volume three times achieving 4 stages in the experimental period the cod removal efficiency in the first stage was 83 0 7 for the cod and 88 0 9 for the tphc like the other sbrs cod removal increased in the second stage reaching up to 85 3 then it decreased to 83 7 in the third stages regarding the elimination of tphc it increased in the second stage reaching 90 at the end of the second and third stages in the last 15 days the cod removal efficiencies tended to a stationary value close to 80 meanwhile tphc elimination reached values above 90 although the sbr uf r reactor presented a high tphcs removal it was not possible to remove them completely leaving a constant content of phenols in the system this may be due to the fact that a phenolic fraction is highly resistant to oxidation 54 61 this fraction mainly consists of phenolic compounds of higher molecular weight 5 kda since the wastewater was obtained by the rejection of a 5 kda uf membrane which is more difficult to be biodegraded 57 finally it was possible to feed the sbr uf r reactor with 720 ml of sample concentration of about 3 3 g l 1 cod and 210 mg l 1 of tphc keeping the removal of cod close to 80 and tphc between 88 and 90 constant acoording to other authors in addition to biodegradation the elimination of phenolic compounds could also be related to other mechanisms such as chemical oxidation evaporation or adsorption onto activated sludge 62 however this was not studied in this work it has to be highlighted that cod removal percentages obtained in the three sbrs were higher than those reported in other studies 63 64 which may be mainly due to the pre treatment and the low concentration of phenolic compounds although the removal percentages of cod and tphc remained constant the concentration of both parameters in the effluent increased chiavola et al 65 in their study of the treatment of raw omw and omw uf permeate with a bioreactor also observed that the concentration of residual polyphenols and total organic matter scaled linearly with the concentration of the influent these authors also mixed omw with dilution water these authors indicated that the increase in the concentration of the effluent corresponded approximately to the inert soluble fraction of the influent which was about 10 also in the mentioned study 65 it was reported a constant removal of around 90 of the cod which implied meeting the required cod value by the legislation however the concentration of phenols was higher than the legal standards required for discharge in the present case by removing previously tphc using resins in the case of fo c and nf r the effluents met the limits for both discharge and reuse as machinery cleaning water the decrease of the removal that occurred in the final stages of the tests could be related to the concentration of microorganisms it can be seen that after each increase in the feed concentration the mlss concentration showed a significant decrease this is due the fact that not all microorganisms could be able to adapt to changes in the medium then a period of acclimation to the new food to microorganisms ratio is needed it can be observed how the mlss from sbr fo c shows the greatest decrease on day 32 which implies that the increase in the feed volume caused a great impact on the organisms on the other hand the mlss concentrations from the sbr uf r reactor were the ones that showed the greatest decrease at the beginning of the test this may be due to the fact that these organisms must deal with both a high organic load and the presence of phenolic compounds which may inhibit the biomass on the other hand although in the later stages the decrease in mlss was less than in the first ones the growth rate of microorganisms was also lower the most affected sbr was the one fed with fo c which started with a mlss concentration of 3 476 g l 1 and ended last stage with only 0 6 g l 1 sbr nf r and sbr uf r began with 3 452 g l 1 and 3 488 g l 1 and ended with 1 2 g l 1 and 1 42 g l 1 respectively 3 3 2 atp dna and bsi the decrease in the mlss is related to cell lysis this can be confirmed with the data presented in fig 7 it is important to point out that on day 11 no sample was taken from the sbr uf r reactor because its first stage which is biomass conditioning lasted 15 days dna values increased in the three sbrs until day 26 specifically dna in sbr fo c increased from 163 to 443 ng ml dna in sbr nf r increased from 265 to 645 ng ml and dna in sbr uf r rose from 69 to 488 ng ml from that day on the behaviour was different in sbr uf r in comparison with the other two sbrs in sbr uf r i e in the sbr treating the sample with the presence of phenolic compounds the lowest values of dna were measured 397 ng ml in the sample taken at the end of the experiment which may be due to the longer time between feeding changes which allows a better adaptation of the microorganisms to the increase in cod and tphc the highest values of dna were measured in the sbr fo c un to around 1000 ng ml these high concentrations are in concordance with the decrease of mlss and cod elimination lower atpc values and higher bsi values than in the other two sbrs confirm the gradual deterioration of the biological process as well as low metanabolic activity 66 the highest bsi for the samples from sbr fo c implies that the stress not only depend on the presence of phenolic compounds but would be also related to the content of organic matter since the wastewater feeding this sbr was the one with the highest concentration of cod 51 in addition it should be noted that this wastewater sample came from a fo process therefore this behaviour could also be related to the increase in conductivity caused by reverse salt diffusion in the fo process it has been reported that an increase in salinity in wastewater samples could increase cell stress and therefore cell lysis in sbr 66 67 4 conclusions in this study the recovery of valuable antioxidant compounds by adsorption desorption with resins and the management by biological treatment of reject concentrate streams from different membrane processes was evaluated by means of adsorption desorption with the mn200 resin percentages of elimination of phenolic compounds 90 were achieved the eluent had a high purity and antioxidant concentrations around 1 7 g l 1 regarding the biological treatment the optimal initial feed concentration was obtained for the three water samples by means of the preliminary biological tests the biological treatment by sbr achieved a high removal of organic matter around 80 and elimination of phenolic compounds around 90 for the uf r finally it should be noted that the

12734,this work studies the valorisation of the concentrates obtained through membrane processes for the purification of olive oil washing wastewater ooww the adsorption with resins desorption process followed by a biological treatment with sequencing batch reactor sbrs three different wastewater samples were treated an ultrafiltration reject stream uf r with a high organic load and low content of phenolic compounds a nanofiltration reject stream nf r which rich in phenolic compounds and with medium organic load a stream concentrated by forward osmosis fo c with high organic content and concentration of phenolic compounds through the adsorption desorption process it was possible to recover 90 and 73 which corresponds to 1 69 and 1 66 g l 1 of the total phenolic compounds reject streams of nf r and fo c respectively with the sbrs it was possible to eliminate around 80 of the organic matter present in the effluent of adsorption and also 90 of the remaining phenolic compounds in the case of uf r the results obtained are promising since on the one hand a high recovery of phenolic compounds was achieved and on the other hand a large part of the organic matter of the remaining streams after adsorption was eliminated in this way a solution for the management of the membrane reject streams is proposed allowing a circular economy in the wastewater treatment of olive oil processing keywords adsorption desorption olive mill wastewater phenolic compounds recovery sequencing batch reactor data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the world production of virgin olive oil has tripled in the last years the member countries of the international olive council ioc produced 93 3 of the world total olive oil production in the 2020 21 campaign with spain 49 being the main producer followed by greece 9 8 italy 9 7 and portugal 4 9 1 this production generates large quantities of liquid effluents called oil mill wastewaters omw whose production in the mediterranean countries fluctuates between 7 106 and 30 106 m3 2 a high organic load a slightly acidic ph low alkalinity low nitrogen content and the presence of lipid fractions and phytotoxic compounds generally characterize these wastewaters these characteristics generate a toxic effect for microorganisms making their treatment difficult 3 over the last few years this wastewater has gone from a waste to a co product of the olive industry all this because it is an outstanding source of antioxidant components phenolic compounds 4 various processes have been proposed for the recovery of phenolic compounds from these sources such as adsorption 5 liquid liquid extraction 6 cloud point extraction 7 cooling crystallization 8 solar distillation 9 and hybrid processes 10 in addition many studies have been reported in which phenolic solutes were successfully recovered using integrated membrane systems in some studies 11 the phenolic fraction is concentrated in the reject streams by means of forward osmosis fo to later fractionate it with ultrafiltration uf and nanofiltration nf other studies 12 used a sequence of microfiltration mf followed by nf membranes and by osmotic distillation od or vacuum membrane distillation vmd although these hybrid membrane processes have been extensively studied for the recovery of phenolic compounds all of them produce a reject stream which is mainly formed by organic matter though phenolic compounds are also present the idea of working with sequential membrane processes is to obtain permeates and or concentrated streams that contain high phenolic compounds concentrations for their further valorisation however there is few information about the management of the streams that are not of interest generally the reject currents considering them as waste in some studies it has been suggested that that they could be used as fertilizers or for biogas production 13 14 nonetheless these currents were not the focus of attention concentrating most of the research only on the recovery of phenolic compounds the adsorption desorption process has been widely studied and used the study of different materials for the adsorption of pollutants is a strong point some of the materials considered are rice husk nanosilica 15 16 activated carbon 17 crude olives stone 18 and polymeric resins 19 although the utilization of bio sorbents from agricultural by products presents some advantages their utilization in the adsorption of phenolic compounds from omw has not offered good results until now 20 among the most used materials currently applied for phenolic compounds resins occupy an important position various studies have shown the great affinity between some resins and phenolic compounds producing effluent from the treatment having a great purity on the other hand their easy recovery and reuse together with low cost and low for the environment make them appropriate technologies for the recovery of these antioxidant compounds on the other hand their easy recovery and reuse together with low cost and low environmental impact make them appropriate technologies for the recovery of these antioxidant compounds 21 22 after the recovery of these compounds the remaining streams which are concentrated in other organic compounds become residues that have to be treated to reduce their organic load 23 in membrane processes there is always a reject current which is mainly formed by organic matter like suspended or colloidal matter biological treatment is an option that offers several advantages such as allowing the removal of organic compounds in an economical space saving and environmentally friendly way without the addition of any chemical reagent 24 an interesting study was carried out by conidi et al 25 where omw was treated with a hybrid membrane process that contemplated first stages of mf and uf followed by two biocatalytic membrane reactors mbmr for the conversion of oleuropein into the isomer of the oleuropein aglycone in this study both the mf and uf rejection currents were recycled to the process feed and no data about the management of the withdrawals from the systems were reported to date no work has been found that presents the recover of all the currents generated in the hybrid membrane processes to sum up through some membrane processes concentrated streams with high purity of phenolic compounds and permeates with characteristics to be reincorporated into the process are obtained 26 however after other treatments proposed in the literature there are residual streams with a high contaminant load either after recovering extracting the phenolic compounds or simply discarded streams during the process in this work the recovery by adsorption of phenolic compounds from reject streams of membrane processes of omw treatment was studied as well as the management of the remaining streams the water samples corresponded to the rejections obtained from uf and nf processes and to the concentrated stream coming from a fo process these streams were further treated by a sbr and the effects of the different pre treatments on the biodegradation were investigated 2 materials and methods 2 1 feed samples characterization the samples corresponded to reject concentrated streams from different membrane processes uf nf and fo fig 1 shows a diagram in which the origin of the different waters to be treated can be seen adsorption is highlighted in pink whereas sbr in green color the figure presents two different hybrid processes proposed for the recovery of phenolic compounds the initial raw samples corresponded to olive oil washing wastewaters ooww and were provided by an olive oil milling plant located in the valencian community spain the raw water was subjected to pre treatment following the protocol presented in previous studies 23 including flotation sedimentation and cartridge filtration the concentrate obtained in the fo process fo c and the reject stream from the nf process nf r were subjected to the adsorption process with resins prior to biological treatment to recover the phenolic compounds in addition the reject stream from the uf process uf r was treated directly with the sbr due to the lower concentration of phenolic compounds table 1 shows the average values of the main parameters measured in the different wastewater samples before the proposed treatment 2 2 adsorption desorption process the resin used was macronet s mn200 supplied by purolite which was selected based on a previous study where the adsorption desorption process was optimized 27 the resin is moderately hydrophobic whit a polystyrene crosslinked with divinylbenzene matrix with a surface area of 1100 m2 g and a pore diameter of 700 15 å macropores micropores the resin was conditioned for 60 min at 140 rpm in a 2 w v solution of sodium hydroxide before being used then the nf r and fo c samples were mixed with a dosage of 40 g l of resin for 180 min at a constant speed of 140 rpm after the working time the liquid fraction was separated by means of a 0 2 μm filter to analyse removal efficiency the resins were washed three times with osmotized water and then subjected to desorption with a 50 v v ethanol water solution under the same conditions used for adsorption 180 min at a constant speed of 140 rpm the supernatant was analysed to measure concentration of cod tphc and sug and calculate the recovery rates the adsorption removal and desorption recovery were calculated with the following equations 1 removal c 0 c e c 0 100 2 recovery c d v d c 0 c e v 0 100 where c 0 and ce are the initial and equilibrium concentrations respectively in terms of cod tphc and sug c d is the concentration in the desorption solution v d and v 0 correspond to the volume in ml of the desorption solution ethanol water 50 and of the initial sample volume respectively adsorption kinetics were studied through two models the pseudo first 28 and pseudo second 29 order reaction which were used to fit the experimental data under the following equations respectively 3 ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t 4 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 1 q e t where the amount of solute adsorbed per gram of adsorbent at equilibrium is represented by qe mg g 1 whereas qt mg g 1 is the concentration of adsorbate in solid phase at time t min k1 min 1 and k2 g mg 1 min 1 represent the pseudo first order and the pseudo second order rate constant respectively these constants were determined by linear regression of two plotted graphs ln qe qt versus time t for the pseudo first order and t qt versus time t for the pseudo second order the intra particle diffusion model also known as weber s diffusion model was used for the identification of the mechanism involved in the adsorption process the adsorption of phenolic compounds is controlled by different steps which can be related to film or external surface diffusion pore diffusion surface diffusion and adsorption on the pore surface or a combination of them 30 the followed eq 5 represents the weber s diffusion model 5 q t k d 1 2 i where k d mg g 1 min ½ is the intra particle diffusion rate constant and i represents the thickness of the boundary layer on the adsorbent surface both parameters were obtained by a linear plot of qt versus t ½ 2 3 biological treatment after the removal of phenolic compounds uf r and nf r and fo c samples were subjected to biological treatment using the following protocol 2 3 1 experiment 1 due to the high organic load present in the wastewater samples a preliminary study in batch mode was carried out the main objective was to find a concentration at which the bacteria were not affected different concentrations of each sample in tap water 5 10 15 20 and 30 v v were mixed with biomass taken from an activated sludge reactor of a municipal wastewater treatment plant in beakers the operation time was 24 h and agitation and aeration were continuous the operating conditions were the same for all the tests maintaining mixed liquor suspended solids mlss of 3 5 g l 1 a feed volume of 0 25 l and a food to microorganism ratio f m of 0 15 gcod gmlss 1 d 1 the required sludge volume was calculated based on the percentage cod concentration of wastewater in the feed as mentioned above the purpose of this study was to determine the concentration of each type of wastewater in percentage that would be appropriate as the initial feed to a biological reactor then once the bacteria have adapted the concentration of wastewater in the feed diluted with tap water was progressively increased to reach the maximum concentrations as possible in addition a biodegradability analysis by a respirometric test was carried out to determinate the toxicity of each sample the test was performed following the protocol presented by zuriaga agustí et al 31 it was carried out by adding different doses 10 ml as first dose and 5 ml for the rest of the doses of wastewater to a 500 ml of mixed liquor sample in order to measure the influence of the sample addition on the standard oxygen uptake rate 2 3 2 experiment 2 once the starting concentration was selected three laboratory reactors named as sbr uf r sbr nf r and sbr fo c volume of reaction 6 l in each reactor were operated as sequencing batch reactors sbr for 65 days the reactors were seeded with activated sludge from a municipal wastewater treatment plant valencia spain and fed with the above mentioned samples dipotassium phosphate and urea both reagents supplied by panreac spain were added to each feed solution to adjust the phosphorous and nitrogen concentrations to obtain a cod n p relationship of 100 5 1 32 the sbrs were operated setting 1 cycle per day with five phases per cycle filling 10 min reaction 1 h 21 h anaerobic aerobic sedimentation 1 5 h draw 10 min and idle 10 min the initial feeding volume ml day was 900 for the sbr fed with fo c and nf r samples and 600 for the sbr uf r the feed volume and consequently the withdrawn volume of treated wastewater was increased gradually during the experiment in fact the feed volume increased a 5 every 10 or 15 days depending on the reactor therefore the hydraulic retention times hrt and the volume exchange ratio ver which is the quotient between the feed volume and the reaction volume were variable during the operation of the reactors being also different for each reactor 2 3 3 analytical methodology of the mixed liquor in both experiments cod mlss total nitrogen tn total phosphorous tp and total phenolic compounds tphc for sbr uf r were measured the cell lysis was studied through dna analysis and the dissolved oxygen concentration do was monitored throughout the process by using standard probes in experiment 1 the parameters were measured at 3 h 6 h and at the end of the test 24 h in experiment 2 these parameters were analysed every two days in each reactor in both tests the removal efficiency r of cod and tphc for sbr uf r was calculated for each reactor by the following equation 6 r c in c ef c in 100 where cin and cef correspond to the concentration mg l 1 of cod or tphc measured in the feed and the sbr effluent experiment 2 or dissolved in the beaker experiment 1 respectively the cod tp tn and the other nitrogen forms were measured by kits merck using a dr600 spectrophotometer hach lange mlss concentrations were measured according to apha 33 tphc mgtyeq l 1 was measured according to singleton et al 34 following the folin ciocalteau method whereas sugars were analysed with sucrose d glucose d fructose colorimetric kit from r biopharm germany using glucose panreac spain as a standard dna was determined by fastdna spin kit mp biomedicals usaatpc following the protocol presented in ferrer polonio et al 35 in experiment 2 atpc adenosine triphosphate from living cells avss active viable solids and bsi bacterial stress index were determined at the end of each stage following the protocol also presented in the above mentioned paper 35 the results of total and dissolved atp were obtained from photonmaster luminometer luminultra in rlu related luminescence units for then being converted to ngatp ml using a standard atp solution ultracheck and lumicapture lite software 3 results 3 1 adsorption desorption table 2 shows the results obtained in the adsorption desorption of phenolic compounds from nf r and fo c samples with the mn200 resin the great affinity of the resin with phenolic compounds can be clearly seen which is reflected in high adsorption percentages 90 this is mainly due to the properties of the resin since the hypercrosslinked polystyrene material gives the surface of the resin the characteristic of being very hydrophobic thus having a great affinity for adsorbates with phenyl groups 36 37 since it has been reported that the presence of other substances present in omw can interfere with the adsorption of phenolic compounds 38 as these substances are able to cause inhibitory effects and reduce the elimination of contaminants the adsorption of cod and sugars has been studied the low adsorption of sugars was also expected since it was observed in a previous study performed by the authors 27 where the low affinity of the mn200 resin for sugars was demostrated the high selectivity for phenolic compounds was one of the reasons considered to selected this resin this behaviour is explained because polymeric styrene based adsorbents have a high specificity for hydrophobic substances such as phenolic compounds showing little interaction with sugars 39 40 this is due to the more favorable interactions between a polymer styrene dvb with aromatic adsorbent species and a hydrophobic substance in comparison with sugars this causes the inhibition of sugars adsorption due to the competitiveness with phenolic compounds adsorption 41 phenolic compounds resin interactions could be of the pi pi type and or hydrogen bonds and occur between the benzene rings in the polymer and the adsorbent aromatic species 42 the highest removal of tphc and the lowest removal of sugars occurred in the nf r sample this may be due to the fact that compared to the fo c sample the nf feed was preceded by an uf process which removed a considerable concentration of organic matter organic matter could compete with the phenolic compounds for the adsorption sites in addition to generate a rapid clogging of the resin reducing the adsorption of specific species 43 another way to justify the better performance of the process for nf r is by calculating the cod related to the total phenolic compounds through the analysis presented by ferrer polonio et al 44 it is possible to calculate theoretically the cod associated to the tphc in mgty l 1 using eq 7 7 cod tphc ads c 0 tphc c e tphc 2 2 where 2 2 corresponds to the mg of o2 needed to oxidate one mg of tyrosol following the same analysis the cod associated to the sugars has been calculated using eq 8 considering that 1 g of glucose is equivalent to 1 1 g of cod 8 cod sug ads c 0 sug c e sug 1 1 the difference between the initial concentration c0 and the equilibrium concentration ce corresponds to the total of tphc or sug adsorbed it can be seen that the percentage of cod that represents the adsorbed phenolic compounds is higher for the nf r sample this trend was also observed for recovery as the solution obtained after desorption presented a higher codtphc cod ratio in the case of the nf r sample this is due to the presence of a large amount of high and low molecular weight compounds such as saccharides amino acids and macromolecules in the fo c sample which could affect the sorption of phenolic compounds 45 however as a result of the ultrafiltration pretreatment see fig 1 the nf r had lower organic content than the fo c these results can relate the pre treatment of the ooww to the phenolic compopunds purity in the final concentrated sample obtained regarding the kinetics of the adsorption process the values obtained after fitting the data to pseudo first and pseudo second order reactions are presented in table 3 it can be seen that the q e obtained with the pseudo first order model gives a very low value compared to the experimental one q e ex on the other hand the pseudo second order model gives an r2 closer to one which better fitting of the experimental data this implies that the adsorption rate depends more on the adsorption capacity of the resin and not on the adsorbate concentration 46 in fig 2 the representation of the intra particle diffusion model is presented a non linearity of the data is observed in fact two trends are clearly seen for both adsorption processes this implies that not only intra particle diffusion controls the process but more than one process affected adsorption 46 the first adsorption step controls up to 4 min1 2 a positive value of the intercept of this first stage can be interpreted as a very fast kinetic process which is responsible for a fast inter particle adsorption of the phenolic compounds on the resin in the initial stage of the kinetic isotherm then the passage from one trend to the other is generally attributed to boundary layer diffusion effects or external mass transfer effects finally the second stage is governed by intra particle diffusion 30 44 47 similar results were obtained by other authors studying the phenolic compounds adsorption with mn200 resin such is the case of the study carried out by valderrama et al 48 who attributed this trend to the sorption stages of the external inter particle diffusion fist stage and internal intra particle diffusion fist stage surfaces and to the equilibrium approach respectively these authors explained that the fast adsorption speed of the first section is due to the sorption in the macroporous structure then the molecules diffuse towards the microporous structure to finally be adsorbed by the surface of the adsorbent particles in the present work the resistance to diffusion increased from the first to the second stage this could explain the decrease observed in the value of kd which changed from 12 61 to 0 48 mgg 1 min 1 2 for the nf r and from 6 03 to 1 32 mgg 1 min 1 2 for the fo c it has to be highlighted that it was possible to remove almost all the phenolic compounds presented in the water samples 96 42 and 92 78 from the nf r and fo c samples respectively this is important to ensure a better treatment in the following biological step since microbial bioconversion can be inhibited due to the toxic and biostatic effects of phenolic compounds 49 in addition a concentrated solution rich in phenolic compounds of the order of 1 7 g l 1 was achieved corresponding to 90 and 73 of the initial total phenolic compounds present in the nf r and fo c water samples respectively an issue to consider in adsorption desorption processes is both the recovery and reuse of the adsorbents in this case it was possible to recover the resin by means of 3 washes with water 5 min at 150 rpm followed by drying in an oven for 3 h at 50 c regarding their reuse it was possible to use the same resins in 4 adsorption desorption cycles without losing their efficiency other studies 44 have reported that after 10 cycles of reuse these resins begin to be affected in terms of their efficiency these authors observed a decrease of 0 9 in the adsorption capacity of phenolic compounds and 8 5 in the desorption percentage when working with ultrafiltered fermentation brines from table olive processing ftop it is important to note that these results were obtained with the permeate from an ultrafiltration process thus the stream is comparable to nf r these authors observed greater decrease in the efficiency 7 9 and 12 1 for the adsorption and desorption capacities respectively when the ftop filtered at 60 μm was directly submitted to an adsorption desorption process therefore both the pretreatment and the characteristics of the wastewater to be treated are key points for resin reuse in summary through the adsorption process the removal of phenolic compounds from nf r and fo c was achieved this implies the recovery of valuable compounds on the one hand as well as the removal of phytotoxic compounds prior to a biological treatment on the other hand 3 2 biological treatment preliminary study the preliminary study was performed in order to obtain information about the biodegradability of the samples and to select the initial feed volume of each sbr operated in the experiment 2 it can be seen in fig 3 that the water samples without phenolic compounds fo c and nf r are more easily degradable by microorganisms as the organic matter was consumed in less time greater decrease in cod thus 50 of the organic matter for the concentrations of 5 10 and 15 for the fo c sample was eliminated in 24 h at concentrations of 20 and 30 the elimination after 24 h droped to 33 approximately for the nf r sample the organic matter removal increased up to 75 for concentrations 15 above this concentration organic matter removal decreased to an average value of 53 the soluble cod values did not present a great variation from 6 to 24 h which was more noticeable for the concentrations of 5 and 10 in both samples this implies that there is no more readily biodegradable organic matter that could be consumed by organisms this is also evidenced by the mlss values once microorganisms have consumed all the readily biodegradable organic compounds they pass to an endogenous respiration phase in which cell lysis is generated this produced a decrease of the mlss concentration from 3 37 0 14 g l 1 to 2 58 0 40 g l 1 for fo c and from 3 51 0 10 g l 1 to 3 06 0 30 g l 1 for nf r mean value in addition an increase of the dissolved oxygen at 24 h was detected reflecting that organic matter degradation has slowed down a different behaviour was observed for the uf r sample the cod decreased only 43 5 average value for 5 and 10 concentrations respectively then the increase in the concentration of the sample caused the cod removal to be reduced to 24 4 the high concentration of tphc and their antimicrobial characteristics explains the slower degradation and possible cell lysis in other words inhibition of biomass occured other authors also reported the antimicrobial characteristics of phenolic compounds 50 53 this can be observed by the decrease in mlss concentration more pronounced when the percentage of wastewater in the feed was higher to confirm the cell lysis a dna test fig 4 was performed it was observed how the dna in the uf r samples increased considerably compared to the other samples likewise the elimination of tphc in the sample was assessed in the uf r sample in table 4 it can be seen that the removal percentages at 24 h were around 21 41 these values are high taking into account the toxicity of these compounds and the conditions of the batch tests section 2 3 1 however the possible elimination of phenolic compounds from the sample by adsorption in the biomass must also be taken into account the highest reduction percentages were observed for sample concentrations of 5 and 10 similar results were seen in a study with pleurotus ostreatus grown in sbr with an omw model solution 54 these authors observed that the removal of phenolic compounds from the fermentation medium was higher in the omw with low phenolic content compared to those with high phenolic content respirometry tests fig 5 confirmed what was expected after batch tests this assay is based on the measurement of the rate of oxygen consumption by the bacteria when they degrade the different samples it can be seen how the fo c and nf r samples show a similar trend slowly decreasing the respiration rate the tests show that there was negligible toxic impact on the activated sludge as almost the same maximum respiration rate rs was achieved after the addition of each sample dose on the other hand a completely different behaviour can be observed for the uf r sample compared to the other two wastewaters analysed the symptoms of toxicity are evident observing a drastic decrease in rs which implies that this sample was more toxic for the microorganisms the results were consistent with those obtained in experiment 1 although several compounds present in omw contribute to its toxicity 55 this was attributed to the presence of phenolic compounds since the samples have similar characteristics only differing in the concentration of these compounds as previusly commented and reported by other authors it is known that phenolic compounds are characterized by having intense phytotoxic and antimicrobial properties 56 therefore their presence would limit the biodegradation of the different wastewater samples studied considering the results explained above it was decided to start the tests of the experiment 2 with a concentration of 15 of nf r cod of 2 71 g l 1 and fo c cod of 4 21 g l 1 in the feeds to sbr nf r and sbr fo c and with a concentration of 10 of the uf r cod of 3 30 g l 1 in the feed to sbr uf r 3 3 biological treatment sbr performance 3 3 1 cod mlss and tphc removal fig 6 shows the mlss growth rates together with the cod removal efficiencies for the sbrs the dashed lines indicate the increments of the feed wastewater sample volume delimiting different operation stages it can be observed that microorganisms better adapted to the water samples without phenolic compounds sbr fo c and sbr nf r since in these reactors cod removal efficiencies reached values above 80 it led to increase the feed volume sample by 5 every 10 days which determined an increase of ver up to 0 01 at each stage in the first ten days the sbr fo c and the sbr nf r reactors reached an average cod removal efficiency of 84 0 3 and 86 0 7 corresponding to a cod concentration in the effluent of 440 9 mg l 1 and 280 15 8 mg l 1 respectively in stage 2 sbr fo c showed an increase in the removal of organic matter above to 92 this behaviour remained stable until the fourth stage achieving an average removal rate of 89 4 similar results were presented by farabegoli et al 57 treating diluted omw with sbr they observed that from the first stage dilution 1 50 cod close to 1 3 g l 1 to the second one dilution 1 25 cod close to 2 4 g l 1 the cod removal increased from 75 to 90 average values they attributed it to the fact that in the first stage the elimination kinetics were slower depending strictly on the concentration of the substrate on the other hand by having less substrate availability the biomass could pass into a state of endogenous respiration producing a partial mineralization in the second stage once biomass has been acclimated the rate of organic matter removal increases after this period the cod removal efficiency fell to 85 2 in the fifth stage this could be due to the fact that the microorganisms would be affected by the increase in food which leads to an increase of the food to microorganisms ratio a high f m ratio can result in an excess of substrate in the effluent if biodegradable organic matter exceeds biomass consumption capacity 58 therefore the cod level in the effluent would increase on the other hand analyzing the results it can be observed that in the fifth stage there was a low growth of mlss which therefore means that there was not enough bacteria in the systems to dispose of the organic matter it has been reported that maintaining an adequate concentration of mlvss and mlss is necessary to prevent overloading the process and make sure that the biomass bacterial population is sufficient for the biological reaction to take place during aerobic degradation 59 regarding the sbr nf r the cod elimination was stable until the fifth stage with an average value of 92 2 then it decreased to 84 and finally in the last stage it managed to achieve an elimination of 89 3 in this reactor the increase in feed volume did not corresponded to a significant decrease in cod removal efficiency finally it should be noted that the low fluctuation in the cod removal efficiencies presented by sbr fo c and sbr nf r was due to the adaptation of the microorganisms to the medium the high values observed for cod removal percentages which remained relatively stable implied that the sludge microbial community was well adapted to the new environment other studies also indicated that the good performance of the sbr in terms of high cod elimination could be related to an adaptability of the biomass to the environment 51 59 60 the behaviour presented by the sbr uf r was very different from the other two sbrs after a first stage of 15 days for acclimation to the initial wastewater feed volume it was possible to increase the feed volume three times achieving 4 stages in the experimental period the cod removal efficiency in the first stage was 83 0 7 for the cod and 88 0 9 for the tphc like the other sbrs cod removal increased in the second stage reaching up to 85 3 then it decreased to 83 7 in the third stages regarding the elimination of tphc it increased in the second stage reaching 90 at the end of the second and third stages in the last 15 days the cod removal efficiencies tended to a stationary value close to 80 meanwhile tphc elimination reached values above 90 although the sbr uf r reactor presented a high tphcs removal it was not possible to remove them completely leaving a constant content of phenols in the system this may be due to the fact that a phenolic fraction is highly resistant to oxidation 54 61 this fraction mainly consists of phenolic compounds of higher molecular weight 5 kda since the wastewater was obtained by the rejection of a 5 kda uf membrane which is more difficult to be biodegraded 57 finally it was possible to feed the sbr uf r reactor with 720 ml of sample concentration of about 3 3 g l 1 cod and 210 mg l 1 of tphc keeping the removal of cod close to 80 and tphc between 88 and 90 constant acoording to other authors in addition to biodegradation the elimination of phenolic compounds could also be related to other mechanisms such as chemical oxidation evaporation or adsorption onto activated sludge 62 however this was not studied in this work it has to be highlighted that cod removal percentages obtained in the three sbrs were higher than those reported in other studies 63 64 which may be mainly due to the pre treatment and the low concentration of phenolic compounds although the removal percentages of cod and tphc remained constant the concentration of both parameters in the effluent increased chiavola et al 65 in their study of the treatment of raw omw and omw uf permeate with a bioreactor also observed that the concentration of residual polyphenols and total organic matter scaled linearly with the concentration of the influent these authors also mixed omw with dilution water these authors indicated that the increase in the concentration of the effluent corresponded approximately to the inert soluble fraction of the influent which was about 10 also in the mentioned study 65 it was reported a constant removal of around 90 of the cod which implied meeting the required cod value by the legislation however the concentration of phenols was higher than the legal standards required for discharge in the present case by removing previously tphc using resins in the case of fo c and nf r the effluents met the limits for both discharge and reuse as machinery cleaning water the decrease of the removal that occurred in the final stages of the tests could be related to the concentration of microorganisms it can be seen that after each increase in the feed concentration the mlss concentration showed a significant decrease this is due the fact that not all microorganisms could be able to adapt to changes in the medium then a period of acclimation to the new food to microorganisms ratio is needed it can be observed how the mlss from sbr fo c shows the greatest decrease on day 32 which implies that the increase in the feed volume caused a great impact on the organisms on the other hand the mlss concentrations from the sbr uf r reactor were the ones that showed the greatest decrease at the beginning of the test this may be due to the fact that these organisms must deal with both a high organic load and the presence of phenolic compounds which may inhibit the biomass on the other hand although in the later stages the decrease in mlss was less than in the first ones the growth rate of microorganisms was also lower the most affected sbr was the one fed with fo c which started with a mlss concentration of 3 476 g l 1 and ended last stage with only 0 6 g l 1 sbr nf r and sbr uf r began with 3 452 g l 1 and 3 488 g l 1 and ended with 1 2 g l 1 and 1 42 g l 1 respectively 3 3 2 atp dna and bsi the decrease in the mlss is related to cell lysis this can be confirmed with the data presented in fig 7 it is important to point out that on day 11 no sample was taken from the sbr uf r reactor because its first stage which is biomass conditioning lasted 15 days dna values increased in the three sbrs until day 26 specifically dna in sbr fo c increased from 163 to 443 ng ml dna in sbr nf r increased from 265 to 645 ng ml and dna in sbr uf r rose from 69 to 488 ng ml from that day on the behaviour was different in sbr uf r in comparison with the other two sbrs in sbr uf r i e in the sbr treating the sample with the presence of phenolic compounds the lowest values of dna were measured 397 ng ml in the sample taken at the end of the experiment which may be due to the longer time between feeding changes which allows a better adaptation of the microorganisms to the increase in cod and tphc the highest values of dna were measured in the sbr fo c un to around 1000 ng ml these high concentrations are in concordance with the decrease of mlss and cod elimination lower atpc values and higher bsi values than in the other two sbrs confirm the gradual deterioration of the biological process as well as low metanabolic activity 66 the highest bsi for the samples from sbr fo c implies that the stress not only depend on the presence of phenolic compounds but would be also related to the content of organic matter since the wastewater feeding this sbr was the one with the highest concentration of cod 51 in addition it should be noted that this wastewater sample came from a fo process therefore this behaviour could also be related to the increase in conductivity caused by reverse salt diffusion in the fo process it has been reported that an increase in salinity in wastewater samples could increase cell stress and therefore cell lysis in sbr 66 67 4 conclusions in this study the recovery of valuable antioxidant compounds by adsorption desorption with resins and the management by biological treatment of reject concentrate streams from different membrane processes was evaluated by means of adsorption desorption with the mn200 resin percentages of elimination of phenolic compounds 90 were achieved the eluent had a high purity and antioxidant concentrations around 1 7 g l 1 regarding the biological treatment the optimal initial feed concentration was obtained for the three water samples by means of the preliminary biological tests the biological treatment by sbr achieved a high removal of organic matter around 80 and elimination of phenolic compounds around 90 for the uf r finally it should be noted that the effluents meet the limits for both discharge and reuse as machinery cleaning water in this way the combination of the processes evaluated in this work can become a solution for the management of
