24885,the question of whether organic or conventional agriculture is most suitable for meeting world food requirements and improving resilience to climate change is the topic of much current research most comparisons however focus either on output efficiency such as yields or on impacts of different nutrient management strategies on the sustainability of the agrosystems and the impacts of each on the agricultural food webs and beneficial insects responsible for pest control or outbreaks has been often overlooked while standard cropping models can explain if why and how organic nutrient and crop management work and how they should be adapted to climate change the lack of mechanistic models of agroecology prevents us from explaining why and how passive and active biocontrol and integrated pest management function when they do not function and what optimal management strategies could be employed in this research we show that agroecological food web models calibrated with field population dynamics data can be used to demonstrate the mechanisms behind food web dynamics that have been previously observed in the field results of scenario simulations show that chemical control provides immediate relief from pest pressures but at high risk of later pest resurgence if control is not repeated on the contrary biological control requires more time to reduce pest populations to acceptable levels but with minimal risk of causing resurgence in all cases success of pest control measures is highly dependent on the date of action in addition the use of modelling tools to optimise biological control application dates led to much better control than either fixed date or pest population threshold based applications these analyses and resulting integrated pest management intervention recommendations are only possible with agroecological food web population dynamics models we encourage future studies to examine more complex food webs from a variety of agroecosystems to test whether functional responses differ significantly and hope that this approach will succeed in bringing agroecological food web predictive modelling to the level where it can routinely be used as

al 2020 this model was chosen as a case study due to the availability of high quality long term data weekly data for nearly one year of population dynamics of both pest and natural enemy populations base case data where no control was attempted display periodically fluctuating population levels of different larval and pupal life stages of the pest o arenosella gradually decreasing to pre outbreak levels while populations of pupal and larval parasitoids follow similar fluctuations but with different time lags the model was calibrated with field data and then used to assess the impact of different organic and non organic pest management strategies including both fixed date and threshold based applications on food web dynamics and the likelihood of success of each in controlling an existing outbreak 2 methods the tiko n malard 2019 software was used for all aspects of simulation this software was chosen for several reasons including its open source licence facilitating result reproducibility implementation in python facilitating data post processing calibration and validation functionalities and modular structure allowing for rapid implementation of new equations processes and management decisions 2 1 trophic structure specification a three species food web was constructed for the study site opisina arenosella and two associated parasitoids based on the food web identified in the literature perera et al 1988 and as in previous work malard et al 2020 o arenosella was modelled with one egg stage five larval instars a pupa and an adult phase the larval parasitoid parasitises third to fifth instar larvae emerges at the end of the fifth instar phase and pupates before emerging as an adult the pupal parasitoid parasitises the pupal phase of o arenosella and is presumed to pupate within the o arenosella pupa emerging directly as an adult from the parasitised pupa fig 1 2 2 equation and a priori selection the model starts the simulation with initial populations and then proceeds to calculate predation followed by reproduction mortality transitions to the next life stage and finally stochastic volatility population totals and cohorts were updated between each step to avoid mathematical inconsistencies transitions from the last life stage of an organism were taken as age dependent mortality and transitions from parasitised insects to the adult or pupal form of the parasitoid were allowed a multiplicative factor to account for the possibility of multiple parasitoids developing inside the same host equations and associated parameters for all modelled aspects of the life stages of the organisms included in the food web model are given below in table 1 different ages for individuals of the same life stage were taken into account with a cohort mechanism up to 10 different age groups were allowed for each life stage at a time if more than 10 cohorts were added through reproduction or transitions before one was freed through mortality or transitions the software added the new cohort to the existing cohort with the least difference in age and assigned to the combined cohort the average age of the two to account for predator saturation when presented with multiple prey species or life stages predation rates per predator were further adjusted according to the rules of joint probability the predation rate per predator f i for each prey i was first normalised according to the maximum potential predation rate a i for that predator prey combination r i f i a i the actual predation rate g i for each predator prey combination was then calculated as follows g i f i 1 i 1 r i i r i ranges for all equation parameters were chosen according to the literature srinivasa murthy et al 2002 perera 1977 perera et al 1988 shameer et al 2018 and then further manually adjusted if simulation runs suggested that regions of the initially specified range were inappropriate initial a priori distributions for most parameters were then established so that 80 of the distribution s probability density function fell within the chosen range this approach was empirically found to achieve a good balance between sufficiently directing the optimisation algorithm towards probable parameter ranges while still allowing for deviation from the specified range if observed data indicated that the initial assumption was wrong all a priori distributions were represented by a normal distribution which was then transformed if necessary to avoid the possibility of overreaching the parameter s theoretical limits specifically an a priori distribution requiring density d within the limits l of the range l 1 l 2 was specified as follows transformed limits are denoted by la for parameters with theoretical ranges

the quantile or percentage point function of the normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 1 in the specific case where d 1 a uniform distribution was assigned as the a priori 2 3 calibration process and validation the model was calibrated with the data reported in perera et al 1988 data were extracted using the webplotdigitizer software rohatgi 2019 using the maximum likelihood estimation mle method with the nash sutcliffe efficiency of the model median as the objective function 30 stochastic repetitions were used during each of 300 iterations the best 20 of these were kept and during future parameter sampling were weighted according to their relative fit in the calibration phase initial populations of all life stages whether observed or not were simultaneously calibrated along with the model parameters 2 4 implementation of management scenarios given the significant parametric and stochastic uncertainties associated with agroecological population dynamics models we took advantage of tiko n s malard 2019 built in support for repetitions and uncertainty bound estimation by running all simulations with 70 parametric and 5 stochastic uncertainty repetitions for a total of 350 repetitions this approach provided much more robust results than the simple best fit parameter approach used in most environmental modelling frameworks as not only the most likely prediction but also the range risk of possible outcomes can be modelled this is of particular importance in agroecological modelling as well as other applications where uncertainty and risk management are important such as epidemiology related insect modelling where significant practical importance is attached to the risk of an insect s outbreak the risk ρ t of crop damage at each point t in time of a simulation was calculated according to the fraction of the 350 uncertainty repetitions stochastic r s and parametric r p of that simulation where the sum of all larval stages of o arenosella p t met or exceeded the economic injury level eil ρ t 1 r s 1 r p 0 p t e i l 1 p t e i l r s r p the eil was taken to be 0 5 o arenosella larvae per coconut palm leaflet muralimohan et al 2008 potential crop damage itself was measured in normalised economic injury level days ned a measure homologous to the concept of degree days and which was calculated according to the following formula n e d t m a x 0 p t e i l e i l n e d t n e d t where ned is the total normalised economic injury in units of days n e d t is the normalised injury at time t unitless eil is the economic injury level individuals per hectare and p t is the pest population median of all repetitions at time t as a practical example a ned value of 10 over a 20 day period indicates that on average pest populations exceeded the economic injury level by 50 2 5 fixed date control simulations were first run with a single application of either pesticide larval parasitoids or pupal parasitoids at different points in time throughout the first two months of the outbreak and the probability of o arenosella larvae exceeding the economic injury level rao et al 2018 was calculated based on the model output confidence intervals as the impact of pesticides on each component of the food web is not clear several possibilities were explored including a very effective generalist pesticide that eliminated 95 of all species as well as less effective pesticides that eliminated the same percentage of different life stages affecting only larval adult or all non egg life stages of all species present for parasitoid releases 3 0 105 individuals comparable in magnitude to that previously reported in field biological control of o arenosella rao et al 2018 were released on the given day note that as tiko n simulates with a mean field approach the spatial dimension ofof parasitoid releases in the field study is not modelled and uniform release is assumed for each control option 30 simulations were run with the same action implemented on different days every other day up until the 61st day of simulation to test the sensitivity of the action s effectiveness to the state of the agroecosystem on the date of application 2 5 1 economic action threshold biological control biological control according to the best practice economic action threshold approach was also modelled with both pupal and larval parasitoid releases given the difficulty in assessing the economic threshold the point at which corrective action should be taken to prevent a pest population from exceeding the economic injury level higley and peterson 2008 from the literature alone 20 different thresholds equally spaced between zero and the economic injury level were tested for each parasitoid and the efficiency of each strategy in preventing or reducing the severity of pest outbreaks was assessed 2 5 2 optimisation of biological control given the potential for biocontrol to manage pests with lower risks but its high dependence on successful timing we applied the model to different rule based biological control scenarios to identify which management rules are most likely to give positive results in practice a central pillar of integrated pest management programmes whether chemical or biological is threshold based control where a pest population threshold is chosen above which action should be taken in order to prevent populations from reaching the eil higley and peterson 2008 stern et al 1959 we therefore tested this approach and compared its effectiveness to that of a food web model based strategy the model was first run under threshold based management scenarios with varying threshold levels the parasitoid application dose consisting of either larval or pupal parasitoids in their adult stage was then equally divided into three smaller applications and the model was connected with an optimisation algorithm to determine the best application dates for these three applications in order to minimise pest populations above the eil biocontrol runs were optimised by dividing the total parasitoid dose 3 0 105 used in fixed date applications into 3 smaller doses 1 0 105 the dynamically dimensioned search algorithm dds tolson and shoemaker 2007 chosen for its availability in python its ability to consider discrete variables such as day of release and its efficiency in finding global optima to complex multivariate models was then used to optimise the best dates for each of the 3 releases between 25 and 150 days of simulation the dds algorithm searches by choosing a value from a normal distribution for each parameter and then keeping the new parameter set if the resulting objective function value is better than the previous best fitting parameter set most notably it changes the size of the search neighbourhood number of parameters changed at each iteration as iterations progress therefore decreasing the dimensionality of the search space and reducing the risk of losing previous calibration gains for more details see tolson and shoemaker 2007 the algorithm was allowed to attempt to combine more than one release on the same day which would effectively mean combining two or more releases into a single larger simultaneous release the algorithm was run for 500 iterations each with 70 parametric and 5 stochastic repetitions while minimising the economic damage as measured by the mean area between the economic injury level and the predicted larval population the process was repeated with both pupal and larval parasitoid releases and the best 10 solutions from each were kept 2 5 3 single parasitoid runs to test the role of each parasitoid on the system in isolation simulations were effectuated with only one parasitoid present for the first 150 days after which it was reintroduced the parasitoid to exclude was removed by repeatedly setting its adult population to 0 at each time step reintroduction was effectuated by adding 1 105 adult individuals equivalent to a typical population level in the base case run of the parasitoid in question at day 150 2 6 software the model was implemented with the python language package for agroecological modelling tiko n malard et al 2020 which is available under an open source license tiko n version 3 0 commit bf4911a was used in this study full documentation is available at tikon readthedocs io all analyses were run using python 3 7 python software foundation psf 2019 see supplementary material for a copy of all code 3 results and discussion 3 1 model construction table 2 summarises the model fit after calibration while fig 2 shows the output of the calibrated model and the relevant field observations overall o arenosella showed better fit than the parasitoids visual inspection of the model outputs confirms that the relevant population dynamics were well captured by the model stages with poor indices of model fit e g o arenosella juvenile 2 are generally explained by a slight misfit in the timing of the population peaks which given their steep slopes leads to large decreases in nse and r2 scores 3 2 pesticides biocontrol and stability the term biocontrol may mean classical biocontrol where a species is introduced to a new geographical range usually in an attempt to control an introduced pest as well as inundative biocontrol where a predatory species already present is released in large quantities in an effort to boost its effectiveness and tip food web dynamics against the pest of concern shaw and hatcher 2017 in this paper we use the term biocontrol to refer to the latter definition as all parasitoids released into the field were already naturally present chemical control always leads unsurprisingly to immediate impact with no risk of pest population levels above the economic injury level eil in the days following applications these initial successes however are followed by high risk of resurgence over the next five months in the case of pesticides that were not equally lethal to all insect life stages biocontrol is instead characterised by a gradual decrease in the risk of population levels exceeding the eil over time generally below the no control scenario fig 3 these results are broadly consistent with those reported in the field study of rao et al 2018 inasmuch as comparison is possible with a field study where detailed population structure initial or after treatment was not given in this simulation study the risk of o arenosella exceeding the eil after 6 months ranges from 0 to approximately 30 while in the field study different fields showed larval populations either at 0 or else slightly above the eil both the risk of inducing pest resurgence in the case of chemical control and the probability of success in biocontrol are highly dependent on the day of intervention though the greatest uncertainty is seen in the case of the selective pesticide as shown in fig 3 middle and right the horizontal dotted line indicates the damage incurred over the corresponding time frame in the base no control scenario runs below this line indicate better control than the base case and runs above indicate worse control in the case of a generally lethal pesticide where no resurgence is seen potential damage over the first 60 days increases gradually as the treatment date is delayed while biological control is mostly inefficient in controlling the outbreak over this period given the time scale necessary for parasitoids to reproduce and kill their hosts its performance over the longer term is markedly better several application days yield similar control as pesticide applications while the overall risk of damage also tends to be lower than that of selective pesticides although the benefits of the control action occur later they importantly never lead to significant pest resurgence these modelling results highlight fundamental differences between biological and chemical pest control that have been observed in the field they support the large body of theoretical and empirical evidence dutcher 2007 guedes et al 2016 tang et al 2013 torres and bueno 2018 that pesticides can induce pest resurgence through their indirect impacts on other components of the food web while they guarantee short term relief from pest damage this comes at a significant date dependent risk of rebound again supporting previous empirical results cohen et al 1994 guedes et al 2016 induced outbreaks were also highly synchronised by date of pesticide application rather than day of year indicating that pesticide application did not merely accentuate inherent cycles bur rather re synchronised the entire system and led to new periodic outbreak risks from an economic point of view such resurgences increase the risk of pesticide lock in flor et al 2019 also referred to as the pesticide treadmill weddle et al 2009 where initial pesticide use in itself generates the necessity for further applications depending on the pesticide in question such situations can carry significant environmental and human health risks in addition to their economic costs for farmers on the other hand biological control was associated with very little risk of worsening a pest outbreak but provided benefits only over the long term which also increases the practical risk of realising too late that an intervention was not successful once an outbreak has started the time lag in results for biological control inevitably leads to more short term crop damage than chemical control no matter the biocontrol strategy highlighting the importance for biocontrol programs to proactively monitor pests and beneficial insects and plan interventions accordingly 3 3 ecological threshold based management the dds algorithm used to optimise the days for optimal biocontrol converged quite rapidly well within the 500 iterations of the model used fig 4 shows the convergence of the algorithm for both the larval and pupal parasitoid biocontrol options in the case of both types of parasitoids food web model optimised application dates provided both lower economic injury risk and much lower uncertainty in expected results than either fixed date or threshold based control measures fig 5 top even though the total number of parasitoids released was kept constant between fixed date and optimised date runs the usefulness of economic thresholds however varied widely between the two parasitoid species for larval parasitoids this approach led to results marginally better than those of a single fixed date application while in the case of pupal parasitoids it led to significantly greater risk of crop economic injury than in the fixed date case that is to say releasing pupal parasitoids when the pest pupal population reaches a certain threshold generally leads to worse results than those obtained from a single randomly chosen release date the use of food web modelling allows for more in depth investigation of the causes of the differences between the two parasitoids as shown in the middle row of fig 5 parasitism rates by the larval parasitoid are inversely related to the larval populations that is the prey and predator population cycles are desynchronised in such a situation the use of thresholds to boost predator populations once prey starts to rise makes ecological sense no such relationship was observed in the case of the more efficient pupal parasitoids however where parasitism levels were apparently not as limited by parasitoid populations at the onset of prey outbreaks the effect of temporarily removing either parasitoid species was also tested counterintuitively the absence of the larval parasitoid led to greatly increased pupal parasitoid activity through a longer availability of pupal hosts and a subsequently rapid control of the pest outbreak on the other hand larval parasitoids alone were unable to control the prey population which increased uncontrolledly until pupal parasitoids were reintroduced fig 5 bottom the predator prey cycles observed between larval parasitoids and their host were therefore integral to maintaining discrete population cycles in the larval host and by consequence in reducing the efficiency of the associated pupal parasitoid overall throughout both chemical and biological control interventions early treatment and lower action thresholds are not synonymous with better control and complex interactions between even the relatively small number of species present often lead to unexpected behaviour we therefore propose instead of date or population threshold based applications the use of ecological action thresholds which we define as food web states which based on field population dynamics data of both pest and beneficial insect populations and agroecological food web modelling are likely to lead to undesirable pest levels within a timeframe of agronomic importance we propose that integrated pest management actions and their timing be optimised according to food web dynamics modelling to minimise both costs and the long term risk of pest damage to the crop a critical question remaining is to what extent the results obtained from the present study are generalisable to different food web structures and whether functional roles of their component species and general responses of the webs to the same pressures or management regimes will be fundamentally similar or divergent we hope that the methodology presented here will be applied more widely with more extensive data sets from diverse environments that can bring agroecological modelling to a level where short and medium term predictions can be generated for a variety of agroecosystems gonzález chang et al 2016 in addition the current study used a mean field approach which assumes homogenous insect distribution across the study site this limitation prevents the model from representing the spatial dynamics of host parasitoid dynamics including potential impacts of different or non homogenous release points for biocontrol future studies with spatially explicit datasets could make use of tiko n s multi field functionalities to divide the study region into different sub fields and consider insect migration between regions it is also important to note that when using modelling results as a decision support tool economic considerations the cost of an action and the associated expected reduction in risk of economic loss to the crop must also be taken into consideration 4 conclusion environmental management models are crucial to our understanding of our impacts on the natural world and to decision making from global climate change models to hydrological and crop models simulation scenarios have found applications from optimisation of crop management to flood and drought early warning systems to predictions of climate change impacts on food supply and opportunities for adaptation we hope that the development of field data based agroecological food web models will similarly stimulate research and more informed decision making in all aspects of the very complicated systems that are agroecosystems declaration

the quantile or percentage point function of the normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 1 in the specific case where d 1 a uniform distribution was assigned as the a priori 2 3 calibration process and validation the model was calibrated with the data reported in perera et al 1988 data were extracted using the webplotdigitizer software rohatgi 2019 using the maximum likelihood estimation mle method with the nash sutcliffe efficiency of the model median as the objective function 30 stochastic repetitions were used during each of 300 iterations the best 20 of these were kept and during future parameter sampling were weighted according to their relative fit in the calibration phase initial populations of all life stages whether observed or not were simultaneously calibrated along with the model parameters 2 4 implementation of management scenarios given the significant parametric and stochastic uncertainties associated with agroecological population dynamics models we took advantage of tiko n s malard 2019 built in support for repetitions and uncertainty bound estimation by running all simulations with 70 parametric and 5 stochastic uncertainty repetitions for a total of 350 repetitions this approach provided much more robust results than the simple best fit parameter approach used in most environmental modelling frameworks as not only the most likely prediction but also the range risk of possible outcomes can be modelled this is of particular importance in agroecological modelling as well as other applications where uncertainty and risk management are important such as epidemiology related insect modelling where significant practical importance is attached to the risk of an insect s outbreak the risk ρ t of crop damage at each point t in time of a simulation was calculated according to the fraction of the 350 uncertainty repetitions stochastic r s and parametric r p of that simulation where the sum of all larval stages of o arenosella p t met or exceeded the economic injury level eil ρ t 1 r s 1 r p 0 p t e i l 1 p t e i l r s r p the eil was taken to be 0 5 o arenosella larvae per coconut palm leaflet muralimohan et al 2008 potential crop damage itself was measured in normalised economic injury level days ned a measure homologous to the concept of degree days and which was calculated according to the following formula n e d t m a x 0 p t e i l e i l n e d t n e d t where ned is the total normalised economic injury in units of days n e d t is the normalised injury at time t unitless eil is the economic injury level individuals per hectare and p t is the pest population median of all repetitions at time t as a practical example a ned value of 10 over a 20 day period indicates that on average pest populations exceeded the economic injury level by 50 2 5 fixed date control simulations were first run with a single application of either pesticide larval parasitoids or pupal parasitoids at different points in time throughout the first two months of the outbreak and the probability of o arenosella larvae exceeding the economic injury level rao et al 2018 was calculated based on the model output confidence intervals as the impact of pesticides on each component of the food web is not clear several possibilities were explored including a very effective generalist pesticide that eliminated 95 of all species as well as less effective pesticides that eliminated the same percentage of different life stages affecting only larval adult or all non egg life stages of all species present for parasitoid releases 3 0 105 individuals comparable in magnitude to that previously reported in field biological control of o arenosella rao et al 2018 were released on the given day note that as tiko n simulates with a mean field approach the spatial dimension ofof parasitoid releases in the field study is not modelled and uniform release is assumed for each control option 30 simulations were run with the same action implemented on different days every other day up until the 61st day of simulation to test the sensitivity of the action s effectiveness to the state of the agroecosystem on the date of application 2 5 1 economic action threshold biological control biological control according to the best practice economic action threshold approach was also modelled with both pupal and larval parasitoid releases given the difficulty in assessing the economic threshold the point at which corrective action should be taken to prevent a pest population from exceeding the economic injury level higley and peterson 2008 from the literature alone 20 different thresholds equally spaced between zero and the economic injury level were tested for each parasitoid and the efficiency of each strategy in preventing or reducing the severity of pest outbreaks was assessed 2 5 2 optimisation of biological control given the potential for biocontrol to manage pests with lower risks but its high dependence on successful timing we applied the model to different rule based biological control scenarios to identify which management rules are most likely to give positive results in practice a central pillar of integrated pest management programmes whether chemical or biological is threshold based control where a pest population threshold is chosen above which action should be taken in order to prevent populations from reaching the eil higley and peterson 2008 stern et al 1959 we therefore tested this approach and compared its effectiveness to that of a food web model based strategy the model was first run under threshold based management scenarios with varying threshold levels the parasitoid application dose consisting of either larval or pupal parasitoids in their adult stage was then equally divided into three smaller applications and the model was connected with an optimisation algorithm to determine the best application dates for these three applications in order to minimise pest populations above the eil biocontrol runs were optimised by dividing the total parasitoid dose 3 0 105 used in fixed date applications into 3 smaller doses 1 0 105 the dynamically dimensioned search algorithm dds tolson and shoemaker 2007 chosen for its availability in python its ability to consider discrete variables such as day of release and its efficiency in finding global optima to complex multivariate models was then used to optimise the best dates for each of the 3 releases between 25 and 150 days of simulation the dds algorithm searches by choosing a value from a normal distribution for each parameter and then keeping the new parameter set if the resulting objective function value is better than the previous best fitting parameter set most notably it changes the size of the search neighbourhood number of parameters changed at each iteration as iterations progress therefore decreasing the dimensionality of the search space and reducing the risk of losing previous calibration gains for more details see tolson and shoemaker 2007 the algorithm was allowed to attempt to combine more than one release on the same day which would effectively mean combining two or more releases into a single larger simultaneous release the algorithm was run for 500 iterations each with 70 parametric and 5 stochastic repetitions while minimising the economic damage as measured by the mean area between the economic injury level and the predicted larval population the process was repeated with both pupal and larval parasitoid releases and the best 10 solutions from each were kept 2 5 3 single parasitoid runs to test the role of each parasitoid on the system in isolation simulations were effectuated with only one parasitoid present for the first 150 days after which it was reintroduced the parasitoid to exclude was removed by repeatedly setting its adult population to 0 at each time step reintroduction was effectuated by adding 1 105 adult individuals equivalent to a typical population level in the base case run of the parasitoid in question at day 150 2 6 software the model was implemented with the python language package for agroecological modelling tiko n malard et al 2020 which is available under an open source license tiko n version 3 0 commit bf4911a was used in this study full documentation is available at tikon readthedocs io all analyses were run using python 3 7 python software foundation psf 2019 see supplementary material for a copy of all code 3 results and discussion 3 1 model construction table 2 summarises the model fit after calibration while fig 2 shows the output of the calibrated model and the relevant field observations overall o arenosella showed better fit than the parasitoids visual inspection of the model outputs confirms that the relevant population dynamics were well captured by the model stages with poor indices of model fit e g o arenosella juvenile 2 are generally explained by a slight misfit in the timing of the population peaks which given their steep slopes leads to large decreases in nse and r2 scores 3 2 pesticides biocontrol and stability the term biocontrol may mean classical biocontrol where a species is introduced to a new geographical range usually in an attempt to control an introduced pest as well as inundative biocontrol where a predatory species already present is released in large quantities in an effort to boost its effectiveness and tip food web dynamics against the pest of concern shaw and hatcher 2017 in this paper we use the term biocontrol to refer to the latter definition as all parasitoids released into the field were already naturally present chemical control always leads unsurprisingly to immediate impact with no risk of pest population levels above the economic injury level eil in the days following applications these initial successes however are followed by high risk of resurgence over the next five months in the case of pesticides that were not equally lethal to all insect life stages biocontrol is instead characterised by a gradual decrease in the risk of population levels exceeding the eil over time generally below the no control scenario fig 3 these results are broadly consistent with those reported in the field study of rao et al 2018 inasmuch as comparison is possible with a field study where detailed population structure initial or after treatment was not given in this simulation study the risk of o arenosella exceeding the eil after 6 months ranges from 0 to approximately 30 while in the field study different fields showed larval populations either at 0 or else slightly above the eil both the risk of inducing pest resurgence in the case of chemical control and the probability of success in biocontrol are highly dependent on the day of intervention though the greatest uncertainty is seen in the case of the selective pesticide as shown in fig 3 middle and right the horizontal dotted line indicates the damage incurred over the corresponding time frame in the base no control scenario runs below this line indicate better control than the base case and runs above indicate worse control in the case of a generally lethal pesticide where no resurgence is seen potential damage over the first 60 days increases gradually as the treatment date is delayed while biological control is mostly inefficient in controlling the outbreak over this period given the time scale necessary for parasitoids to reproduce and kill their hosts its performance over the longer term is markedly better several application days yield similar control as pesticide applications while the overall risk of damage also tends to be lower than that of selective pesticides although the benefits of the control action occur later they importantly never lead to significant pest resurgence these modelling results highlight fundamental differences between biological and chemical pest control that have been observed in the field they support the large body of theoretical and empirical evidence dutcher 2007 guedes et al 2016 tang et al 2013 torres and bueno 2018 that pesticides can induce pest resurgence through their indirect impacts on other components of the food web while they guarantee short term relief from pest damage this comes at a significant date dependent risk of rebound again supporting previous empirical results cohen et al 1994 guedes et al 2016 induced outbreaks were also highly synchronised by date of pesticide application rather than day of year indicating that pesticide application did not merely accentuate inherent cycles bur rather re synchronised the entire system and led to new periodic outbreak risks from an economic point of view such resurgences increase the risk of pesticide lock in flor et al 2019 also referred to as the pesticide treadmill weddle et al 2009 where initial pesticide use in itself generates the necessity for further applications depending on the pesticide in question such situations can carry significant environmental and human health risks in addition to their economic costs for farmers on the other hand biological control was associated with very little risk of worsening a pest outbreak but provided benefits only over the long term which also increases the practical risk of realising too late that an intervention was not successful once an outbreak has started the time lag in results for biological control inevitably leads to more short term crop damage than chemical control no matter the biocontrol strategy highlighting the importance for biocontrol programs to proactively monitor pests and beneficial insects and plan interventions accordingly 3 3 ecological threshold based management the dds algorithm used to optimise the days for optimal biocontrol converged quite rapidly well within the 500 iterations of the model used fig 4 shows the convergence of the algorithm for both the larval and pupal parasitoid biocontrol options in the case of both types of parasitoids food web model optimised application dates provided both lower economic injury risk and much lower uncertainty in expected results than either fixed date or threshold based control measures fig 5 top even though the total number of parasitoids released was kept constant between fixed date and optimised date runs the usefulness of economic thresholds however varied widely between the two parasitoid species for larval parasitoids this approach led to results marginally better than those of a single fixed date application while in the case of pupal parasitoids it led to significantly greater risk of crop economic injury than in the fixed date case that is to say releasing pupal parasitoids when the pest pupal population reaches a certain threshold generally leads to worse results than those obtained from a single randomly chosen release date the use of food web modelling allows for more in depth investigation of the causes of the differences between the two parasitoids as shown in the middle row of fig 5 parasitism rates by the larval parasitoid are inversely related to the larval populations that is the prey and predator population cycles are desynchronised in such a situation the use of thresholds to boost predator populations once prey starts to rise makes ecological sense no such relationship was observed in the case of the more efficient pupal parasitoids however where parasitism levels were apparently not as limited by parasitoid populations at the onset of prey outbreaks the effect of temporarily removing either parasitoid species was also tested counterintuitively the absence of the larval parasitoid led to greatly increased pupal parasitoid activity through a longer availability of pupal hosts and a subsequently rapid control of the pest outbreak on the other hand larval parasitoids alone were unable to control the prey population which increased uncontrolledly until pupal parasitoids were reintroduced fig 5 bottom the predator prey cycles observed between larval parasitoids and their host were therefore integral to maintaining discrete population cycles in the larval host and by consequence in reducing the efficiency of the associated pupal parasitoid overall throughout both chemical and biological control interventions early treatment and lower action thresholds are not synonymous with better control and complex interactions between even the relatively small number of species present often lead to unexpected behaviour we therefore propose instead of date or population threshold based applications the use of ecological action thresholds which we define as food web states which based on field population dynamics data of both pest and beneficial insect populations and agroecological food web modelling are likely to lead to undesirable pest levels within a timeframe of agronomic importance we propose that integrated pest management actions and their timing be optimised according to food web dynamics modelling to minimise both costs and the long term risk of pest damage to the crop a critical question remaining is to what extent the results obtained from the present study are generalisable to different food web structures and whether functional roles of their component species and general responses of the webs to the same pressures or management regimes will be fundamentally similar or divergent we hope that the methodology presented here will be applied more widely with more extensive data sets from diverse environments that can bring agroecological modelling to a level where short and medium term predictions can be generated for a variety of agroecosystems gonzález chang et al 2016 in addition the current study used a mean field approach which assumes homogenous insect distribution across the study site this limitation prevents the model from representing the spatial dynamics of host parasitoid dynamics including potential impacts of different or non homogenous release points for biocontrol future studies with spatially explicit datasets could make use of tiko n s multi field functionalities to divide the study region into different sub fields and consider insect migration between regions it is also important to note that when using modelling results as a decision support tool economic considerations the cost of an action and the associated expected reduction in risk of economic loss to the crop must also be taken into consideration 4 conclusion environmental management models are crucial to our understanding of our impacts on the natural world and to decision making from global climate change models to hydrological and crop models simulation scenarios have found applications from optimisation of crop management to flood and drought early warning systems to predictions of climate change impacts on food supply and opportunities for adaptation we hope that the development of field data based agroecological food web models will similarly stimulate research and more informed decision making in all aspects of the very complicated systems that are agroecosystems declaration

24886,the contributions of long lived nitrous oxide n2o to global climate and environment have received increasing attention especially atmospheric nitrogen n deposition has substantially increased in recent decades due to the extensive use of fossil fuels in industry which strongly stimulates the n2o emissions of terrestrial ecosystem several models have been developed to simulate the impacts of environmental factors on n2o emission from soil but there are still large differences in the simulations of n2o emission and their responses to atmospheric deposition over global or regional scales using observations from n addition experiments in a subtropical forest this study compared five widely used n2o modules or algorithms i e the n2o modules of daycent pnet n dndc and dyn and the algorithm of noe and ngas to investigate their performances for reproducing n2o emission and especially the impacts of two forms of n additions i e nh4 n and no3 n respectively of two levels low and high on n2o emission in general the five modules reproduced the seasonal variations of n2o emission under the high levels of n addition compared to low ones for both nh4 n and no3 n however not all modules can reproduce larger n2o emission relatively larger n2o emissions in measurements due to nh4 n compared to no3 n additions were not indicated neither in all the modules moreover there were substantial differences in simulating the ratios of n2o emission from nitrification and denitrification processes due to disagreements in the structure of these modules or algorithms the comparison highlights the need to improve the representation of n2o production and diffusion processes at the same time it also highlights the application of wfps in the model methodology as a key scheme that mediates the two microbial processes i e nitrification and denitrification could probably improve the performances of n2o models in future research keywords nitrous oxide module nitrogen deposition forest module data comparison 1 introduction nitrous oxide n2o is one of the most important greenhouse gases and contributes about 6 24 to overall global radiative forcing as the third contributor after carbon dioxide and methane ipcc 2014 wmo 2011 n2o plays an important role in depleting stratospheric ozone which keeps harmful ultra violet radiation reaching the earth surface ravishankara et al 2009 since the industrial revolution the atmospheric n2o concentration has increased nearly 21 from about 270 ppbv during the pre industrial era to 325 9 ppbv in 2013 with an average increase rate of about 0 82 ppbv yr 1 during the last decade wmo 2014 terrestrial ecosystems can act as either sources or sinks for atmospheric n2o depending on time and location bellingrath kimura et al 2015 chapuis lardy et al 2007 cui et al 2018 li et al 2016 globally natural sources from terrestrial ecosystems contribute more than 50 to the n2o releases to the atmosphere denman et al 2007 quantifying n2o fluxes in global terrestrial ecosystems therefore is an urgent task for predicting future climate change sheldon and barnhart 2009 xu et al 2012 several process based n cycle models have been developed and widely used for quantifying the spatial temporal variations in n2o flux li et al 1992 engel and prentice 1993 grant et al 1993 potter et al 1996 xu et al 2008 zhuang et al 2012 in general these models usually integrate key biogeochemical processes including nutrient mineralization immobilization nitrification and denitrification however there exist substantial disagreements in the estimated magnitude and spatial distribution of n2o at regional and global scales fig 1 for example xu et al 2008 used the dyn model to estimate global terrestrial ecosystem n2o emission at 13 31 tg n yr 1 which is 3 94 times the estimate of 3 37 tg n yr 1 arrived at by zhuang et al 2012 fig 1 these models are the combination of equations describing the environmental regulations of n2o emission individual model validation however is not sufficient to identify the sources of the wide range of model differences to do this a rigorous comparison in a standardized framework with consistent validation datasets and driving variables is very necessary an earlier model intercomparison has evaluated four important n2o modules or algorithms fang et al 2015 this study contributed to our understanding of the effects of various environmental factors on the fractions of n2o released from different microbial processes however the productions of n2o from the processes which dominate n2o fluxes were not compared for the estimation of n2o emission it is extremely helpful to compare estimates from a variety of n2o algorithms or modules against consistent and extensive measurements that are available so as to generate more robust estimates of n2o flux dynamics atmospheric nitrogen n deposition which is closely related to n2o emission has shown a strong increasing trend in recent decades due to the extensive use of fossil fuels in industry and transportation and the heavy application of fertilizers in agriculture liu et al 2013 it is estimated that global atmospheric n deposition has increased from 1 tg n in the 1860s to 25 40 tg n in the 2000s and is projected to continuously increase to 210 tg n by the year 2050 neff et al 2002 lamarque et al 2005 galloway et al 2008 lu et al 2016 based on a meta analysis of n addition experimental data worldwide liu and greaver 2009 concluded that n addition could have a significantly positive impact on n2o emission the fundamental reason lie in that constant nitrogen deposition can give rise to changes in plant physiology and soil microbial community in terrestrial ecosystems litton et al 2007 treseder 2008 which consequently result in changes in soil biogenic n2o emission butterbach bahl et al 1997 allen and schlesinger 2004 bange 2006 chen et al 2015 for forest ecosystems the availability of soil ammonium nh4 and nitrate no3 can be increased in case of chronic n deposition thus affecting n2o flux from soils smith et al 2003 bowden et al 2004 monteny et al 2006 many nitrogen models which were widely used in the study of terrestrial n cycling are significant different in their performances of simulating n2o flux engel and priesack 1993 li et al 1992 potter et al 1996 parton et al 1996 xu et al 2008 zhuang et al 2012 thus far to our knowledge few studies have evaluated the performance of these model or modules for simulating the impacts of n deposition on n2o emission from the view of model development and improvement in eastern china forest ecosystem was recognized as the region receiving the highest atmospheric n deposition in southeast china liu et al 2013 many studies have been carried out to investigate the impacts of n deposition on n2o emission from forest soils huang et al 2010 wang et al 2011 in this study five widely used n2o algorithms or modules of some vegetation ecosystem models i e the n2o modules of daycent the daily version of the century ecosystem model del grosso et al 2001 parton et al 1996 2001 pnet n dndc an integrated model of the photosynthesis evapotranspiration model the denitrification decomposition model and the nitrification model li et al 2000 dyn the global dynamic nitrogen model xu et al 2008 noe the algorithm of nitrous oxide emission henault et al 2005 and ngas a hybrid of a process oriented model and a nutrient cycling model parton et al 1996 were chosen for examination of their performances under different levels of n deposition in a subtropical forest in southeast china the study aims to i examine the performance of these modules in a forest ecosystem particularly for seasonal variations of n2o emission ii investigate the ability of these modules under different levels of n deposition as well as two n forms and iii identify key issues in the application of these modules and future development in order to improve the simulation of n2o emission 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site this module data comparison is based on field experiments conducted at a subtropical evergreen forest station the qianyanzhou ecological station 26 44 39 n 115 03 33 e the station is in jiangxi province of southern china which is one of the important regions subject to atmospheric n deposition the study plots were located in the slash pine plantation established in 1958 average tree height was about 15 m with diameter at breast height of 16 1 cm stand basal area of 35 m2 ha 1 and leaf area index of 4 5 dominant understory and midstory species are woodwardia japonica l f sm dicranopteris dichotoma thunb bernh loropetalum chinense r br olv and quercus fabrei hance the study site has a humid monsoon climate with a mean air temperature of 17 9 c and precipitation of 1469 mm per year a large portion of the precipitation occurs in spring and early summer due to relatively lower precipitation and higher air temperature however it is drier in late summer and autumn fig s1 the site soil is weathered from red sandstone and mud stone it is classified as red earth ferrisols with small gravels and sometimes accompanied with paddy soil anthrosols and fluvo aquic soils the topography gently undulates with a slopes of 5 10 and elevation of about 100 m a s l soil depth ranges from 50 cm to 80 cm the soil is typically composed of three mineral particles sand 17 silt 68 and clay 15 the means of soil bulk density organic carbon and total n content are about 1 57 g cm 3 7 2 g kg 1 and 0 55 g kg 1 respectively wang et al 2012 soil ph of the surface part ranges from 4 82 to 5 45 2 2 experimental design the field experiments were conducted during april december 2012 a previous study on the atmospheric n deposition in the region showed the rate of n deposition ranged from 30 73 kg n ha 1 yr 1 huang et al 2010 accordingly based on these measurements two levels low and high n additions i e 40 and 120 kg n ha 1 yr 1 respectively of two different n fertilizers nh4cl and nano3 were applied to generate two scenarios of n deposition these two scenarios were generated to mimic one and three fold increases in atmospheric n deposition in the future respectively at the same time a control experiment was carried out for comparison each level of n treatment was conducted in a subplot of 20 m 20 m with a space of 10 m between any two plots three replications were employed for each treatment at random so there were totally 15 subplots included in the experiments the n fertilizer solutions were sprayed on the subplots once a month in 12 equal applications and the control plots received only equivalent deionized water 2 3 measurements sampling and data processing flux data of n2o was determined using static opaque chambers and gas chromatography method fang et al 2014 the chambers were installed near an eddy covariance tower in the ecological station and were made of two parts a square base frame 50 cm l 50 cm w 10 cm h and a top 50 cm l 50 cm w 15 cm h the measurements of n2o concentration within the chamber were conducted in the morning from 9 00 am to 11 00 am beijing standard time totally five gas samples were collected using 100 ml syringes immediately when the chambers were closed and 10 20 30 and 40 min after that the measurements of n2o flux were on conducted twice a week only the data of a particular day on which both the n2o fluxes and soil environmental factors were of relatively better quality were applied in the comparison totally there were about 28 days selected during the whole year the soil flux of n2o was calculated based on the rate of change in its concentration within the chamber the rate was estimated as the slope of the regression between concentration and time wang et al 2011 soil temperatures at 5 and 10 cm depths both inside and outside the chambers were monitored at each chamber site using portable temperature probes jm624 digital thermometer living jinming ltd tianjin china at the same time volumetric soil moisture m3 m 3 was measured using a moisture probe meter tdr100 spectrum technologies inc plainfield il usa this measurement was replicated ten times and the average of the ten measurements were used as the moisture value at the time soil water filled pore space wfps was calculated using the methods reported by fang et al 2014 at the same time of measuring gas flux five soil samples were collected at random nearby the static chambers from a depth of 0 20 cm using an auger 2 5 cm in diameter for each layer at each plot a composite sample which was made of these soil samples was used to determine soil inorganic n content the composite samples were passed through a 2 mm sieve to get rid of gravels stones and plant roots then to prepare soil suspension the samples were extracted to 1 0 m kcl solution and shaken for 1 h after those the soil water suspension was filtered through whatman no 40 filter paper and finally used to determine the contents of soil nh4 n and no3 n for ph determination soil samples were dried and passed through 1 mm mesh sieve the samples were then added into a beaker distilled water was added and stirred well with a glass rod after standing for 1 h the suspension was used to determine ph values using the potentiometry method 2 4 n2o modules algorithm five n2o modules or algorithms were selected in this module data comparison the n2o emission modules of daycent parton et al 1996 2001 del grosso et al 2001 pnet n dndc li et al 2000 and dyn xu et al 2008 the n2o algorithm of noe henault et al 2005 and the generalized model ngas parton et al 1996 all five investigated n2o modules are based on two microbial metabolic pathways nitrification and denitrification which are separately simulated from these two processes using the following equation 1 f n 2 o f n t f d n where f n 2 o is the n2o emission from soil to air g n m 2 h 1 and f n t and f d n are n2o emissions from nitrification and denitrification processes respectively detailed description of the modules or algorithms can be found from the supplemental online material although ngas is defined as a general model for n2 and n2o formation from nitrification and denitrification and is intended for use in a range of ecosystems it can be potentially incorporated into n cycling models as a module thus we considered it a module in the present study to make it comparable to other modules so it is with the noe algorithm 2 5 simulation protocol and parameter inversion the comparison was carried out based on the assumptions and methodologies of the five n2o modules and the variables used to drive them daycent is an ecosystem model which is designed to simulate terrestrial c n p and s dynamics parton et al 2001 as one submodel of daycent the n2o module simulates daily n2o and nox emission from soils the module assumes that n gas flux from denitrification is controlled by soil nitrate concentration labile c availability and o2 availability and that soil nitrification rates are controlled by soil ammonium concentration water content temperature and ph the variables used to drive the n2o module are provided by other submodels for the pnet n dndc there are two components included in the model one consists of three submodels i e the submodel of soil climate forest growth and decomposition quantifying the impacts of ecological drivers on soil environmental factors the other acts as a gas emission module which consists of two processes i e nitrification and denitrification predicting the impacts of soil environmental factors on no and n2o emissions three hypotheses with respect to n2o emission in the model are 1 nitrification denitrification and chemodenitrification are the three major reactions related to the production consumption of n2o 2 the key factors that affect the rates of nitrification and denitrification include soil redox potential and the size and activity of nitrifier and denitrifier populations in soil and 3 nitrification and denitrification are supposed to occur in aerobic and anaerobic microsites in soil respectively li et al 2000 the variables used to drive the n2o module is are from other modules dyn is global dynamic nitrogen scheme which has been developed and incorporated into the lund posdam jena lpj dynamic global vegetation model to simulate the flows of n through atmosphere vegetation litter and soil and back into atmosphere xu et al 2008 the n2o module of dyn which is developed to simulate the flows of n among atmosphere vegetation litter and soil is based on two microbial metabolic pathways i e nitrification and denitrification the module assumption is that both of the two processes occur only in the top 50 cm of soils the estimation of n2o fluxes are empirically simulated as fractions of predicted rates of nitrification and denitrification which are primarily controlled by soil environmental factors and substrates concentrations the algorithm noe has been proved to have the ability to predict n2o emissions from various ecosystems with local biological parameters in each investigated situation henault et al 2005 noe is based on the hypothesis that n2o estimates can be simplified as functions of soil physical factors and substrates concentrations johnsson et al 1991 similar assumptions are made in model ngas which is more like a simplified process model and assumes that different n cycling can be represented as a function of various drivers e g the soil water temperature texture and ph without representing soil microbial activities bradbury et al 1993 parton et al 1988 as most of the n2o modules above are driven by variables provided by other modules of the models that contain them they can theoretically be driven by the observations of these variables if they are available and the final estimates of n2o emission can potentially be more reliable all makes sure that the current comparison is logical and practical therefore the field observations of soil temperature soil moisture ph soil respiration dissolved organic carbon soil nh4 content and soil no3 content were used to drive the five modules as one of the key drivers wfps was derived using the following equation fang et al 2014 2 w f p s v w c 1 b d 2 65 where vwc is soil volumetric moisture content bd is soil bulk density g cm 3 and 2 65 is soil particle density g cm 3 the nonlinear regression procedure proc nlin in the statistical analysis system sas sas institute inc cary nc usa was applied to optimize the module parameters using observed n2o emission for all five experiments because a lot of parameters were required to run all the modules and it was impossible to measure each of parameters in the field we adopted different strategies to parameterize the modules for the parameters that were used to set up the initial conditions of these modules e g initial soil microbial biomass etc we used measurements from literatures for other parameters that cannot be measured in situ due to experiment limitation e g potential maximum denitrification rate the proportion of nitrified and denitrified n emitted as gases and rate of gas diffusion etc we calibrated them using a bayesian based mcmc method yuan et al 2012 to carry out the calibrations we first specified the ranges for the module parameters namely lower and upper boundaries as well as their initial values the values were derived from previous researches on the modules or algorithms of noe henault and germon 2000 henault et al 2001 2005 garrido et al 2002 ngas parton et al 1988 1996 garrido et al 2002 dyn ingwersen et al 1999 breuer et al 2002 khalil et al 2004 well and flessa 2008 daycent del grosso et al 2000 groffman et al 2000 parton et al 2001 and pn et dndc van verseveld et al 1977 shan and couiman 1978 hartel and alexander 1987 blagodatsky and richter 1998 hosen et al 2000 then we run the modules separately with about 20 000 simulations for each one the calibrated parameter values were used to simulate n2o emissions table s1 to investigate the performances of the five modules the method of correlation analysis was applied to examine the relationships between the observed fluxes of n2o emission and the simulated values from the modules the value of significance p was set to 0 05 totally three metrics were used i the coefficient of determination between observation and simulation r2 ii absolute predictive error pe quantifying the difference between simulated and observed values iii relative predictive error rpe computed as 3 r p e s o o 100 where s and o are mean simulated and mean observed values respectively at the same time analysis of covariance anova was conducted to examine the differences of n2o emission between n addition and control plots from both observations and simulations in order to investigate the impacts of n deposition on n2o flux 3 results all these modules or algorithms were generally able to reproduce the seasonal patterns of measured n2o fluxes for both control and four n addition treatments the measurements showed the peak n2o emissions of all the treatments occur during april july and the lowest emissions occur in winter fig 2 comparatively the simulated results showed the n2o emissions from various modules demonstrated similar variations even with a few differences and good correlations with observations table 1 although there were some abrupt changes in the simulations of n2o emissions under different n addition treatments the simulated n2o emissions generally decreased from spring summer to autumn winter indicating the seasonal patterns of n2o emissions fig 2 most modules captured the peak and trough of n2o emission collectively the five modules explained 1 16 of the variations in n2o fluxes across all experiment plots table 1 not all modules fully indicated the stimulations of n additions to n2o emission that were observed in field experiments according to the observed n2o fluxes no3 n and nh4 n additions increased n2o emission for four addition experiments and high no3 n and nh4 n additions led to higher n2o emission compared to low ones fig 3 furthermore larger increases of n2o emission occurred for nh4 n compared to no3 n addition experiments however there are some differences in the estimates of n2o emissions from these modules for no3 n addition treatments larger impacts due to higher n additions compared to low ones were well produced by the n2o modules of dyn daycent and pnet n dndc for nh4 n addition treatments however the similar impacts were not reproduced very well by all the n2o modules except for noe algorithm in addition the observations also indicated higher simulations of n2o emission for nh4 n compared with no3 n additions the results indicated that only noe algorithm reproduced larger impacts of nh4 n on n2o emissions compared with low nh4 n level note letters indicate significant differences among n2o values for the same levels of n addition from different module simulations or observation r2 is the coefficient of determination between observation and simulation pe is absolute predictive error rpe is relative predictive error indicates the mean value of observed or simulated n2o emissions indicates significance of p 0 05 because n2o emissions are generally from two different microbial processes i e nitrification and denitrification the proportions of n2o emissions due to both processes were calculated to quantify their contributions to total emissions all five modules showed consistently negative correlations between the ratios of n2o emission from nitrification and wfps fig 4 a the five modules showed that nitrification contributed more than half of n2o emissions however there were large differences in the ratios of n2o fluxes generated by nitrification and denitrification among the modules or algorithms fig 4b on average the daycent module simulated the lowest ratio about 55 4 of n2o emissions generated by nitrification and the largest ratio about 89 5 was for the dyn module fig 4b 4 discussion 4 1 the performances of n2o modules or algorithms n deposition from the atmosphere has been documented to increase with industry activities galloway et al 2004 which is believed to have great impacts on n2o emission from soil how much n2o can be released is mostly attributed to soil microbial processes studies showed chronic n deposition had significant influence on the availability of soil inorganic n e g nh4 and no3 for microbes metabolism monteny et al 2006 wang et al 2016 therefore the estimation of n2o emissions from these modules really depends on the soil microbial pathways our comparison found that the five investigated modules or algorithms were able to predict the seasonable pattern of n2o emissions under different levels of n additions during the entire season and that the estimates of the gas fluxes were generally close to field observations except for a few abrupt values fig 2 similar findings were reported from several recent model evaluations which reported unstable performance of n2o models senapati et al 2016 for example different studies with the daycent module have found a range of correlations from weak to strong across different agroecosystems henault et al 2012 parton et al 2001 found correlations between daily measured vs simulated n2o emissions with range 0 0 44 from a variety of five different grassland sites in the usa other ecosystem modules also face similar difficulties in simulation of daily n2o emissions for example dndc yeluripati et al 2015 and coupmodel he et al 2016 the comparison revealed the complexity in modeling the impacts of n addition on n2o emission the field observations in the current study indicated larger n2o emissions for nh4 n compared with no3 n additions at two addition levels fig 3 however these impacts were not reproduced by all of the five modules except for noe module previous study showed that the impacts of nh4 n addition on n2o emissions are to some extent larger compared with no3 n addition wang et al 2016 this is probably due to two primary reasons one is that under favorable soil temperature and moisture the process of nitrification contributes relatively more to n2o emission compared with denitrification if soil is acidic the addition of nh4 n can significantly increase the substrates for ammonia oxidizers and the abundance of ammonia oxidizing archaea which give rise to increases in soil autotrophic nitrification rate gao et al 2016a 2016b the other reason is that additions of nh4 n fertilizers can have larger positive impacts on the acidification of soil compared with the additions of no3 n which can be attributed to the accumulation of h in soil solution and the leaching of no3 from soil tian and niu 2015 the consequent soil acidification is favorable to the growth of soil nitrifiers but unfavorable to soil denitrifiers isobe et al 2016 which accounts for the dominant process of nitrification 4 2 structure differences among n2o modules the performance of these n2o modules strongly depends on the methodology of the modules and also on the major pathways of n2o emissions and their responses to environmental conditions this is because the processes of n2o emissions are extremely competitive and are controlled by many drivers e g soil temperature moisture soil redox potential and the availability of substrates for microbes schmidt et al 2000 in the present study the modules did not completely capture the environmental regulation of n2o emission which can be highly attributed to two soil microbial processes i e nitrification and denitrification because the two processes are closely associated with the coexistence of aerobic and anaerobic zones in soils henault et al 2012 hu et al 2015 their occurrences are actually regulated by the availability of soil oxygen which is related to soil texture and soil moisture conditions e g wfps li et al 1992 this is demonstrated by a study in a n fertilizer amended soil which showed that n2o emissions were attributed to a combination of nitrification up to 35 53 and denitrification only 2 9 and that the emission are highly correlated with wfps with the highest emission at around 70 wfps huang et al 2014 similar dominant contributions of nitrification e g around 29 kool et al 2011 and about 88 well et al 2008 were also reported to be associated with soil wfps all these conclusions demonstrate that the favorable wfps conditions for n2o production from nitrification are within the range of 30 70 whereas denitrification dominates n2o production in relatively wet soils with wfps 80 braker and conrad 2011 huang et al 2014 in the current study the values of wfps were within the range of 30 70 which was favorable to the occurrence of nitrification and therefore can account for the capabilities of these modules to capture the influences of environmental drivers generally in the five n2o modules soil water content is used as a key driver controlling the balance of two microbial processes namely nitrification and denitrification based on the scheme for differentiating the two processes these modules were grouped into three categories 1 category 1 c1 in which a specific parameter e g wfps is applied in the methodology of the modules 2 category 2 c2 in which a similar driver is used to indirectly represent the effect of wfps in the modules and 3 category 3 c3 in which no specific driver is applied for c1 modules e g noe a simplified scheme is used to separate the nitrification and denitrification processes nitrification only occurs if wfps 80 whereas denitrification only occurs if wfps 62 within the range of 62 80 the two processes may occur simultaneously henault et al 2005 for c2 modules e g dyn and pnet n dndc aerobic and anaerobic microsites are assumed to exist simultaneously in most soils nitrification occurs in aerobic microsites and denitrification is mainly in anaerobic microsites the key factor affecting the ratio between aerobic and anaerobic microsites is soil redox potential which controls the ratio between nitrification and denitrification and is represented indirectly by the effect of wfps li et al 1992 xu et al 2008 for c3 modules e g ngas and daycent no specific threshold is applied for the differentiation of the two processes and they are assumed to occur simultaneously parton et al 1996 2001 del grosso et al 2001 statistics on the coefficients r2 table 1 between observations and field measurements of n2o emissions under all levels of n additions showed that the average coefficient for modules in c1 group in which a specific cut off of wfps was used was much higher about 0 448 than that about 0 204 in both c2 and c3 groups these statistics indicated a potentially better performance of the module in c1 group under future n deposition compared with those in c2 and c3 groups based on these analyses it can be probably inferred although the methodology of the five modules is believed to be the fundamental reason for the differences in the estimates of n2o emissions the application of wfps in the methodology as a key scheme that regulates the balance of nitrification and denitrification should be highlighted 4 3 uncertainty the spatial and temporal variability of n2o emission is closely associated with the complexity of n2o production and diffusion processes as well as production pathways making the estimation of n2o emission particularly challenging the uncertainties in this comparison can potentially result from the drivers and parameters that are used to drive those processes although the drivers e g soil environmental factors and soil substrates were measured in the field as close to the chambers of the gas flux as possible to reduce measurement errors there was still a possibility of uncertainty in the measurements due to the spatial heterogeneity of soil properties a second reason may lie in the inversions of the parameters for each of the n2o emission modules in the study the parameters required to run all the modules were calibrated using a bayesian based mcmc method and worked well during the simulation however they were not collected in the field and were to some extent different from the measured values therefore these parameters could potentially give rise to uncertainties in the estimation of n2o emissions specific measurements in situ will be extremely helpful to reduce the uncertainties in future study 5 conclusions we examined the performances of five n2o modules of different ecosystem models for indicating the impacts of different levels of n addition on n2o emission results indicated that the investigated modules can represent the general seasonal variations of n2o emissions under both n addition and non n addition levels however additions of nh4 n rather than no3 n could have more significant effects on n2o emissions from soils which were not well represented by all of the modules in addition not all the modules were able to reproduce relatively larger n2o emissions at high level of n additions compared with low additions for both no3 n and nh4 n additions in the present comparison moreover the analysis suggested the differences in module methodologies resulted in substantial differences in n2o emissions at the same time the comparison highlighted the scheme of wfps in mediating the two microbial processes i e nitrification and denitrification so as to improve

24886,the contributions of long lived nitrous oxide n2o to global climate and environment have received increasing attention especially atmospheric nitrogen n deposition has substantially increased in recent decades due to the extensive use of fossil fuels in industry which strongly stimulates the n2o emissions of terrestrial ecosystem several models have been developed to simulate the impacts of environmental factors on n2o emission from soil but there are still large differences in the simulations of n2o emission and their responses to atmospheric deposition over global or regional scales using observations from n addition experiments in a subtropical forest this study compared five widely used n2o modules or algorithms i e the n2o modules of daycent pnet n dndc and dyn and the algorithm of noe and ngas to investigate their performances for reproducing n2o emission and especially the impacts of two forms of n additions i e nh4 n and no3 n respectively of two levels low and high on n2o emission in general the five modules reproduced the seasonal variations of n2o emission under the high levels of n addition compared to low ones for both nh4 n and no3 n however not all modules can reproduce larger n2o emission relatively larger n2o emissions in measurements due to nh4 n compared to no3 n additions were not indicated neither in all the modules moreover there were substantial differences in simulating the ratios of n2o emission from nitrification and denitrification processes due to disagreements in the structure of these modules or algorithms the comparison highlights the need to improve the representation of n2o production and diffusion processes at the same time it also highlights the application of wfps in the model methodology as a key scheme that mediates the two microbial processes i e nitrification and denitrification could probably improve the performances of n2o models in future research keywords nitrous oxide module nitrogen deposition forest module data comparison 1 introduction nitrous oxide n2o is one of the most important greenhouse gases and contributes about 6 24 to overall global radiative forcing as the third contributor after carbon dioxide and methane ipcc 2014 wmo 2011 n2o plays an important role in depleting stratospheric ozone which keeps harmful ultra violet radiation reaching the earth surface ravishankara et al 2009 since the industrial revolution the atmospheric n2o concentration has increased nearly 21 from about 270 ppbv during the pre industrial era to 325 9 ppbv in 2013 with an average increase rate of about 0 82 ppbv yr 1 during the last decade wmo 2014 terrestrial ecosystems can act as either sources or sinks for atmospheric n2o depending on time and location bellingrath kimura et al 2015 chapuis lardy et al 2007 cui et al 2018 li et al 2016 globally natural sources from terrestrial ecosystems contribute more than 50 to the n2o releases to the atmosphere denman et al 2007 quantifying n2o fluxes in global terrestrial ecosystems therefore is an urgent task for predicting future climate change sheldon and barnhart 2009 xu et al 2012 several process based n cycle models have been developed and widely used for quantifying the spatial temporal variations in n2o flux li et al 1992 engel and prentice 1993 grant et al 1993 potter et al 1996 xu et al 2008 zhuang et al 2012 in general these models usually integrate key biogeochemical processes including nutrient mineralization immobilization nitrification and denitrification however there exist substantial disagreements in the estimated magnitude and spatial distribution of n2o at regional and global scales fig 1 for example xu et al 2008 used the dyn model to estimate global terrestrial ecosystem n2o emission at 13 31 tg n yr 1 which is 3 94 times the estimate of 3 37 tg n yr 1 arrived at by zhuang et al 2012 fig 1 these models are the combination of equations describing the environmental regulations of n2o emission individual model validation however is not sufficient to identify the sources of the wide range of model differences to do this a rigorous comparison in a standardized framework with consistent validation datasets and driving variables is very necessary an earlier model intercomparison has evaluated four important n2o modules or algorithms fang et al 2015 this study contributed to our understanding of the effects of various environmental factors on the fractions of n2o released from different microbial processes however the productions of n2o from the processes which dominate n2o fluxes were not compared for the estimation of n2o emission it is extremely helpful to compare estimates from a variety of n2o algorithms or modules against consistent and extensive measurements that are available so as to generate more robust estimates of n2o flux dynamics atmospheric nitrogen n deposition which is closely related to n2o emission has shown a strong increasing trend in recent decades due to the extensive use of fossil fuels in industry and transportation and the heavy application of fertilizers in agriculture liu et al 2013 it is estimated that global atmospheric n deposition has increased from 1 tg n in the 1860s to 25 40 tg n in the 2000s and is projected to continuously increase to 210 tg n by the year 2050 neff et al 2002 lamarque et al 2005 galloway et al 2008 lu et al 2016 based on a meta analysis of n addition experimental data worldwide liu and greaver 2009 concluded that n addition could have a significantly positive impact on n2o emission the fundamental reason lie in that constant nitrogen deposition can give rise to changes in plant physiology and soil microbial community in terrestrial ecosystems litton et al 2007 treseder 2008 which consequently result in changes in soil biogenic n2o emission butterbach bahl et al 1997 allen and schlesinger 2004 bange 2006 chen et al 2015 for forest ecosystems the availability of soil ammonium nh4 and nitrate no3 can be increased in case of chronic n deposition thus affecting n2o flux from soils smith et al 2003 bowden et al 2004 monteny et al 2006 many nitrogen models which were widely used in the study of terrestrial n cycling are significant different in their performances of simulating n2o flux engel and priesack 1993 li et al 1992 potter et al 1996 parton et al 1996 xu et al 2008 zhuang et al 2012 thus far to our knowledge few studies have evaluated the performance of these model or modules for simulating the impacts of n deposition on n2o emission from the view of model development and improvement in eastern china forest ecosystem was recognized as the region receiving the highest atmospheric n deposition in southeast china liu et al 2013 many studies have been carried out to investigate the impacts of n deposition on n2o emission from forest soils huang et al 2010 wang et al 2011 in this study five widely used n2o algorithms or modules of some vegetation ecosystem models i e the n2o modules of daycent the daily version of the century ecosystem model del grosso et al 2001 parton et al 1996 2001 pnet n dndc an integrated model of the photosynthesis evapotranspiration model the denitrification decomposition model and the nitrification model li et al 2000 dyn the global dynamic nitrogen model xu et al 2008 noe the algorithm of nitrous oxide emission henault et al 2005 and ngas a hybrid of a process oriented model and a nutrient cycling model parton et al 1996 were chosen for examination of their performances under different levels of n deposition in a subtropical forest in southeast china the study aims to i examine the performance of these modules in a forest ecosystem particularly for seasonal variations of n2o emission ii investigate the ability of these modules under different levels of n deposition as well as two n forms and iii identify key issues in the application of these modules and future development in order to improve the simulation of n2o emission 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site this module data comparison is based on field experiments conducted at a subtropical evergreen forest station the qianyanzhou ecological station 26 44 39 n 115 03 33 e the station is in jiangxi province of southern china which is one of the important regions subject to atmospheric n deposition the study plots were located in the slash pine plantation established in 1958 average tree height was about 15 m with diameter at breast height of 16 1 cm stand basal area of 35 m2 ha 1 and leaf area index of 4 5 dominant understory and midstory species are woodwardia japonica l f sm dicranopteris dichotoma thunb bernh loropetalum chinense r br olv and quercus fabrei hance the study site has a humid monsoon climate with a mean air temperature of 17 9 c and precipitation of 1469 mm per year a large portion of the precipitation occurs in spring and early summer due to relatively lower precipitation and higher air temperature however it is drier in late summer and autumn fig s1 the site soil is weathered from red sandstone and mud stone it is classified as red earth ferrisols with small gravels and sometimes accompanied with paddy soil anthrosols and fluvo aquic soils the topography gently undulates with a slopes of 5 10 and elevation of about 100 m a s l soil depth ranges from 50 cm to 80 cm the soil is typically composed of three mineral particles sand 17 silt 68 and clay 15 the means of soil bulk density organic carbon and total n content are about 1 57 g cm 3 7 2 g kg 1 and 0 55 g kg 1 respectively wang et al 2012 soil ph of the surface part ranges from 4 82 to 5 45 2 2 experimental design the field experiments were conducted during april december 2012 a previous study on the atmospheric n deposition in the region showed the rate of n deposition ranged from 30 73 kg n ha 1 yr 1 huang et al 2010 accordingly based on these measurements two levels low and high n additions i e 40 and 120 kg n ha 1 yr 1 respectively of two different n fertilizers nh4cl and nano3 were applied to generate two scenarios of n deposition these two scenarios were generated to mimic one and three fold increases in atmospheric n deposition in the future respectively at the same time a control experiment was carried out for comparison each level of n treatment was conducted in a subplot of 20 m 20 m with a space of 10 m between any two plots three replications were employed for each treatment at random so there were totally 15 subplots included in the experiments the n fertilizer solutions were sprayed on the subplots once a month in 12 equal applications and the control plots received only equivalent deionized water 2 3 measurements sampling and data processing flux data of n2o was determined using static opaque chambers and gas chromatography method fang et al 2014 the chambers were installed near an eddy covariance tower in the ecological station and were made of two parts a square base frame 50 cm l 50 cm w 10 cm h and a top 50 cm l 50 cm w 15 cm h the measurements of n2o concentration within the chamber were conducted in the morning from 9 00 am to 11 00 am beijing standard time totally five gas samples were collected using 100 ml syringes immediately when the chambers were closed and 10 20 30 and 40 min after that the measurements of n2o flux were on conducted twice a week only the data of a particular day on which both the n2o fluxes and soil environmental factors were of relatively better quality were applied in the comparison totally there were about 28 days selected during the whole year the soil flux of n2o was calculated based on the rate of change in its concentration within the chamber the rate was estimated as the slope of the regression between concentration and time wang et al 2011 soil temperatures at 5 and 10 cm depths both inside and outside the chambers were monitored at each chamber site using portable temperature probes jm624 digital thermometer living jinming ltd tianjin china at the same time volumetric soil moisture m3 m 3 was measured using a moisture probe meter tdr100 spectrum technologies inc plainfield il usa this measurement was replicated ten times and the average of the ten measurements were used as the moisture value at the time soil water filled pore space wfps was calculated using the methods reported by fang et al 2014 at the same time of measuring gas flux five soil samples were collected at random nearby the static chambers from a depth of 0 20 cm using an auger 2 5 cm in diameter for each layer at each plot a composite sample which was made of these soil samples was used to determine soil inorganic n content the composite samples were passed through a 2 mm sieve to get rid of gravels stones and plant roots then to prepare soil suspension the samples were extracted to 1 0 m kcl solution and shaken for 1 h after those the soil water suspension was filtered through whatman no 40 filter paper and finally used to determine the contents of soil nh4 n and no3 n for ph determination soil samples were dried and passed through 1 mm mesh sieve the samples were then added into a beaker distilled water was added and stirred well with a glass rod after standing for 1 h the suspension was used to determine ph values using the potentiometry method 2 4 n2o modules algorithm five n2o modules or algorithms were selected in this module data comparison the n2o emission modules of daycent parton et al 1996 2001 del grosso et al 2001 pnet n dndc li et al 2000 and dyn xu et al 2008 the n2o algorithm of noe henault et al 2005 and the generalized model ngas parton et al 1996 all five investigated n2o modules are based on two microbial metabolic pathways nitrification and denitrification which are separately simulated from these two processes using the following equation 1 f n 2 o f n t f d n where f n 2 o is the n2o emission from soil to air g n m 2 h 1 and f n t and f d n are n2o emissions from nitrification and denitrification processes respectively detailed description of the modules or algorithms can be found from the supplemental online material although ngas is defined as a general model for n2 and n2o formation from nitrification and denitrification and is intended for use in a range of ecosystems it can be potentially incorporated into n cycling models as a module thus we considered it a module in the present study to make it comparable to other modules so it is with the noe algorithm 2 5 simulation protocol and parameter inversion the comparison was carried out based on the assumptions and methodologies of the five n2o modules and the variables used to drive them daycent is an ecosystem model which is designed to simulate terrestrial c n p and s dynamics parton et al 2001 as one submodel of daycent the n2o module simulates daily n2o and nox emission from soils the module assumes that n gas flux from denitrification is controlled by soil nitrate concentration labile c availability and o2 availability and that soil nitrification rates are controlled by soil ammonium concentration water content temperature and ph the variables used to drive the n2o module are provided by other submodels for the pnet n dndc there are two components included in the model one consists of three submodels i e the submodel of soil climate forest growth and decomposition quantifying the impacts of ecological drivers on soil environmental factors the other acts as a gas emission module which consists of two processes i e nitrification and denitrification predicting the impacts of soil environmental factors on no and n2o emissions three hypotheses with respect to n2o emission in the model are 1 nitrification denitrification and chemodenitrification are the three major reactions related to the production consumption of n2o 2 the key factors that affect the rates of nitrification and denitrification include soil redox potential and the size and activity of nitrifier and denitrifier populations in soil and 3 nitrification and denitrification are supposed to occur in aerobic and anaerobic microsites in soil respectively li et al 2000 the variables used to drive the n2o module is are from other modules dyn is global dynamic nitrogen scheme which has been developed and incorporated into the lund posdam jena lpj dynamic global vegetation model to simulate the flows of n through atmosphere vegetation litter and soil and back into atmosphere xu et al 2008 the n2o module of dyn which is developed to simulate the flows of n among atmosphere vegetation litter and soil is based on two microbial metabolic pathways i e nitrification and denitrification the module assumption is that both of the two processes occur only in the top 50 cm of soils the estimation of n2o fluxes are empirically simulated as fractions of predicted rates of nitrification and denitrification which are primarily controlled by soil environmental factors and substrates concentrations the algorithm noe has been proved to have the ability to predict n2o emissions from various ecosystems with local biological parameters in each investigated situation henault et al 2005 noe is based on the hypothesis that n2o estimates can be simplified as functions of soil physical factors and substrates concentrations johnsson et al 1991 similar assumptions are made in model ngas which is more like a simplified process model and assumes that different n cycling can be represented as a function of various drivers e g the soil water temperature texture and ph without representing soil microbial activities bradbury et al 1993 parton et al 1988 as most of the n2o modules above are driven by variables provided by other modules of the models that contain them they can theoretically be driven by the observations of these variables if they are available and the final estimates of n2o emission can potentially be more reliable all makes sure that the current comparison is logical and practical therefore the field observations of soil temperature soil moisture ph soil respiration dissolved organic carbon soil nh4 content and soil no3 content were used to drive the five modules as one of the key drivers wfps was derived using the following equation fang et al 2014 2 w f p s v w c 1 b d 2 65 where vwc is soil volumetric moisture content bd is soil bulk density g cm 3 and 2 65 is soil particle density g cm 3 the nonlinear regression procedure proc nlin in the statistical analysis system sas sas institute inc cary nc usa was applied to optimize the module parameters using observed n2o emission for all five experiments because a lot of parameters were required to run all the modules and it was impossible to measure each of parameters in the field we adopted different strategies to parameterize the modules for the parameters that were used to set up the initial conditions of these modules e g initial soil microbial biomass etc we used measurements from literatures for other parameters that cannot be measured in situ due to experiment limitation e g potential maximum denitrification rate the proportion of nitrified and denitrified n emitted as gases and rate of gas diffusion etc we calibrated them using a bayesian based mcmc method yuan et al 2012 to carry out the calibrations we first specified the ranges for the module parameters namely lower and upper boundaries as well as their initial values the values were derived from previous researches on the modules or algorithms of noe henault and germon 2000 henault et al 2001 2005 garrido et al 2002 ngas parton et al 1988 1996 garrido et al 2002 dyn ingwersen et al 1999 breuer et al 2002 khalil et al 2004 well and flessa 2008 daycent del grosso et al 2000 groffman et al 2000 parton et al 2001 and pn et dndc van verseveld et al 1977 shan and couiman 1978 hartel and alexander 1987 blagodatsky and richter 1998 hosen et al 2000 then we run the modules separately with about 20 000 simulations for each one the calibrated parameter values were used to simulate n2o emissions table s1 to investigate the performances of the five modules the method of correlation analysis was applied to examine the relationships between the observed fluxes of n2o emission and the simulated values from the modules the value of significance p was set to 0 05 totally three metrics were used i the coefficient of determination between observation and simulation r2 ii absolute predictive error pe quantifying the difference between simulated and observed values iii relative predictive error rpe computed as 3 r p e s o o 100 where s and o are mean simulated and mean observed values respectively at the same time analysis of covariance anova was conducted to examine the differences of n2o emission between n addition and control plots from both observations and simulations in order to investigate the impacts of n deposition on n2o flux 3 results all these modules or algorithms were generally able to reproduce the seasonal patterns of measured n2o fluxes for both control and four n addition treatments the measurements showed the peak n2o emissions of all the treatments occur during april july and the lowest emissions occur in winter fig 2 comparatively the simulated results showed the n2o emissions from various modules demonstrated similar variations even with a few differences and good correlations with observations table 1 although there were some abrupt changes in the simulations of n2o emissions under different n addition treatments the simulated n2o emissions generally decreased from spring summer to autumn winter indicating the seasonal patterns of n2o emissions fig 2 most modules captured the peak and trough of n2o emission collectively the five modules explained 1 16 of the variations in n2o fluxes across all experiment plots table 1 not all modules fully indicated the stimulations of n additions to n2o emission that were observed in field experiments according to the observed n2o fluxes no3 n and nh4 n additions increased n2o emission for four addition experiments and high no3 n and nh4 n additions led to higher n2o emission compared to low ones fig 3 furthermore larger increases of n2o emission occurred for nh4 n compared to no3 n addition experiments however there are some differences in the estimates of n2o emissions from these modules for no3 n addition treatments larger impacts due to higher n additions compared to low ones were well produced by the n2o modules of dyn daycent and pnet n dndc for nh4 n addition treatments however the similar impacts were not reproduced very well by all the n2o modules except for noe algorithm in addition the observations also indicated higher simulations of n2o emission for nh4 n compared with no3 n additions the results indicated that only noe algorithm reproduced larger impacts of nh4 n on n2o emissions compared with low nh4 n level note letters indicate significant differences among n2o values for the same levels of n addition from different module simulations or observation r2 is the coefficient of determination between observation and simulation pe is absolute predictive error rpe is relative predictive error indicates the mean value of observed or simulated n2o emissions indicates significance of p 0 05 because n2o emissions are generally from two different microbial processes i e nitrification and denitrification the proportions of n2o emissions due to both processes were calculated to quantify their contributions to total emissions all five modules showed consistently negative correlations between the ratios of n2o emission from nitrification and wfps fig 4 a the five modules showed that nitrification contributed more than half of n2o emissions however there were large differences in the ratios of n2o fluxes generated by nitrification and denitrification among the modules or algorithms fig 4b on average the daycent module simulated the lowest ratio about 55 4 of n2o emissions generated by nitrification and the largest ratio about 89 5 was for the dyn module fig 4b 4 discussion 4 1 the performances of n2o modules or algorithms n deposition from the atmosphere has been documented to increase with industry activities galloway et al 2004 which is believed to have great impacts on n2o emission from soil how much n2o can be released is mostly attributed to soil microbial processes studies showed chronic n deposition had significant influence on the availability of soil inorganic n e g nh4 and no3 for microbes metabolism monteny et al 2006 wang et al 2016 therefore the estimation of n2o emissions from these modules really depends on the soil microbial pathways our comparison found that the five investigated modules or algorithms were able to predict the seasonable pattern of n2o emissions under different levels of n additions during the entire season and that the estimates of the gas fluxes were generally close to field observations except for a few abrupt values fig 2 similar findings were reported from several recent model evaluations which reported unstable performance of n2o models senapati et al 2016 for example different studies with the daycent module have found a range of correlations from weak to strong across different agroecosystems henault et al 2012 parton et al 2001 found correlations between daily measured vs simulated n2o emissions with range 0 0 44 from a variety of five different grassland sites in the usa other ecosystem modules also face similar difficulties in simulation of daily n2o emissions for example dndc yeluripati et al 2015 and coupmodel he et al 2016 the comparison revealed the complexity in modeling the impacts of n addition on n2o emission the field observations in the current study indicated larger n2o emissions for nh4 n compared with no3 n additions at two addition levels fig 3 however these impacts were not reproduced by all of the five modules except for noe module previous study showed that the impacts of nh4 n addition on n2o emissions are to some extent larger compared with no3 n addition wang et al 2016 this is probably due to two primary reasons one is that under favorable soil temperature and moisture the process of nitrification contributes relatively more to n2o emission compared with denitrification if soil is acidic the addition of nh4 n can significantly increase the substrates for ammonia oxidizers and the abundance of ammonia oxidizing archaea which give rise to increases in soil autotrophic nitrification rate gao et al 2016a 2016b the other reason is that additions of nh4 n fertilizers can have larger positive impacts on the acidification of soil compared with the additions of no3 n which can be attributed to the accumulation of h in soil solution and the leaching of no3 from soil tian and niu 2015 the consequent soil acidification is favorable to the growth of soil nitrifiers but unfavorable to soil denitrifiers isobe et al 2016 which accounts for the dominant process of nitrification 4 2 structure differences among n2o modules the performance of these n2o modules strongly depends on the methodology of the modules and also on the major pathways of n2o emissions and their responses to environmental conditions this is because the processes of n2o emissions are extremely competitive and are controlled by many drivers e g soil temperature moisture soil redox potential and the availability of substrates for microbes schmidt et al 2000 in the present study the modules did not completely capture the environmental regulation of n2o emission which can be highly attributed to two soil microbial processes i e nitrification and denitrification because the two processes are closely associated with the coexistence of aerobic and anaerobic zones in soils henault et al 2012 hu et al 2015 their occurrences are actually regulated by the availability of soil oxygen which is related to soil texture and soil moisture conditions e g wfps li et al 1992 this is demonstrated by a study in a n fertilizer amended soil which showed that n2o emissions were attributed to a combination of nitrification up to 35 53 and denitrification only 2 9 and that the emission are highly correlated with wfps with the highest emission at around 70 wfps huang et al 2014 similar dominant contributions of nitrification e g around 29 kool et al 2011 and about 88 well et al 2008 were also reported to be associated with soil wfps all these conclusions demonstrate that the favorable wfps conditions for n2o production from nitrification are within the range of 30 70 whereas denitrification dominates n2o production in relatively wet soils with wfps 80 braker and conrad 2011 huang et al 2014 in the current study the values of wfps were within the range of 30 70 which was favorable to the occurrence of nitrification and therefore can account for the capabilities of these modules to capture the influences of environmental drivers generally in the five n2o modules soil water content is used as a key driver controlling the balance of two microbial processes namely nitrification and denitrification based on the scheme for differentiating the two processes these modules were grouped into three categories 1 category 1 c1 in which a specific parameter e g wfps is applied in the methodology of the modules 2 category 2 c2 in which a similar driver is used to indirectly represent the effect of wfps in the modules and 3 category 3 c3 in which no specific driver is applied for c1 modules e g noe a simplified scheme is used to separate the nitrification and denitrification processes nitrification only occurs if wfps 80 whereas denitrification only occurs if wfps 62 within the range of 62 80 the two processes may occur simultaneously henault et al 2005 for c2 modules e g dyn and pnet n dndc aerobic and anaerobic microsites are assumed to exist simultaneously in most soils nitrification occurs in aerobic microsites and denitrification is mainly in anaerobic microsites the key factor affecting the ratio between aerobic and anaerobic microsites is soil redox potential which controls the ratio between nitrification and denitrification and is represented indirectly by the effect of wfps li et al 1992 xu et al 2008 for c3 modules e g ngas and daycent no specific threshold is applied for the differentiation of the two processes and they are assumed to occur simultaneously parton et al 1996 2001 del grosso et al 2001 statistics on the coefficients r2 table 1 between observations and field measurements of n2o emissions under all levels of n additions showed that the average coefficient for modules in c1 group in which a specific cut off of wfps was used was much higher about 0 448 than that about 0 204 in both c2 and c3 groups these statistics indicated a potentially better performance of the module in c1 group under future n deposition compared with those in c2 and c3 groups based on these analyses it can be probably inferred although the methodology of the five modules is believed to be the fundamental reason for the differences in the estimates of n2o emissions the application of wfps in the methodology as a key scheme that regulates the balance of nitrification and denitrification should be highlighted 4 3 uncertainty the spatial and temporal variability of n2o emission is closely associated with the complexity of n2o production and diffusion processes as well as production pathways making the estimation of n2o emission particularly challenging the uncertainties in this comparison can potentially result from the drivers and parameters that are used to drive those processes although the drivers e g soil environmental factors and soil substrates were measured in the field as close to the chambers of the gas flux as possible to reduce measurement errors there was still a possibility of uncertainty in the measurements due to the spatial heterogeneity of soil properties a second reason may lie in the inversions of the parameters for each of the n2o emission modules in the study the parameters required to run all the modules were calibrated using a bayesian based mcmc method and worked well during the simulation however they were not collected in the field and were to some extent different from the measured values therefore these parameters could potentially give rise to uncertainties in the estimation of n2o emissions specific measurements in situ will be extremely helpful to reduce the uncertainties in future study 5 conclusions we examined the performances of five n2o modules of different ecosystem models for indicating the impacts of different levels of n addition on n2o emission results indicated that the investigated modules can represent the general seasonal variations of n2o emissions under both n addition and non n addition levels however additions of nh4 n rather than no3 n could have more significant effects on n2o emissions from soils which were not well represented by all of the modules in addition not all the modules were able to reproduce relatively larger n2o emissions at high level of n additions compared with low additions for both no3 n and nh4 n additions in the present comparison moreover the analysis suggested the differences in module methodologies resulted in substantial differences in n2o emissions at the same time the comparison highlighted the scheme of wfps in mediating the two microbial processes i e nitrification and denitrification so as to improve the performances of n2o models in future research declaration of competing interest we together declare that we have no financial and personal relationships with other people or organizations that can

24887,enhancing the understanding of marine phytoplankton primary production is paramount due to the relationships with oceanic food webs energy fluxes carbon cycle and earth s climate as field measurements of this process are both expensive and time consuming indirect approaches which can estimate primary production from remotely sensed imagery are the only viable large scale solution we boosted the quality of phytoplankton primary production estimates with respect to a previously developed model by embedding ecological knowledge into the training of an artificial neural network in order to achieve this goal we drove the training procedure on the basis of both theoretical and data derived ecological knowledge about phytoplankton primary production a single peak constraint exploits the theoretical knowledge about the vertical shape of the production profile a depth weighted error procedure was based on available information about the production magnitude along the water column a variable learning rate and momentum approach allowed to better exploit the available data to train our artificial neural network thanks to this customized procedure we improved the quality of the primary production estimates from both a theoretical and a numerical point of view accordingly the new artificial neural networks not only provided ecologically sounder estimates but also explained up to 4 more variance with respect to the traditional error back propagation solution this result was achieved exclusively through an ecologically driven customization of the basic algorithm since the dataset and predictive variables were the same utilized in the conventional counterpart trained with a classic error back propagation algorithm we suggest that the proposed rationale could lead to improved performances in similar modelling applications keywords marine phytoplankton primary production artificial neural networks machine learning ecologically sound training customized algorithm 1 introduction 1 1 scientific background oceans cover roughly 70 of the earth s surface enhancing the understanding of their physical and biological dynamics is therefore paramount costanza 1999 kildow and mcilgorm 2010 in this context marine phytoplankton plays a pivotal role since it accounts for the bulk of the whole oceanic primary production duarte and cebrián 1996 accordingly it is intimately linked to the carbon cycle and it influences the ocean atmosphere interactions through a net carbon dioxide uptake by the water column caldeira and duffy 2000 holland heinrich d 2006 sabine et al 2004 moreover a share of this fixed carbon is removed from the fast carbon cycle through sinking of organic matter in a process known as biological pump longhurst and glen harrison 1989 furthermore since the phytoplankton constitutes the first trophic level in the marine environment the production expressed by its photosynthetic organisms represents the main source of energy supporting the marine food webs anderson et al 2018 richardson and schoeman 2004 therefore phytoplankton primary production deeply influences not only the characteristics of the marine ecosystems and in turn the respective ecosystem services cloern et al 2014 costanza et al 1997 hattam et al 2015 but also earth s climate behrenfeld et al 2016 hays et al 2005 indirect approaches for estimating the phytoplankton production have raised in popularity as field measurements are expensive and time consuming especially on a large spatial scale clark et al 2001 low décarie et al 2014 several techniques have been applied to model the phytoplankton primary production in order to assess its spatial and temporal variability on a global scale according to the classification proposed by campbell et al 2002 modelling attempts range from depth and wave integrated to depth and wave resolved estimators it should be noted that several comparison studies of primary production models were carried out in the primary productivity algorithm round robin pparr framework campbell et al 2002 carr et al 2006 lee et al 2015 saba et al 2011 the main focus of the pparr was to provide a common context in which the main features and differences among the various techniques could be assessed this framework was extremely valuable for all the researchers involved in the study of the phytoplankton production in fact in this context both strengths and weaknesses of the different models were highlighted thus helping to define directions for further improvements among the compared models only one was based on a machine learning ml approach i e a depth integrated artificial neural network ann scardi 2001 in mattei et al 2018 we resumed the use of anns for the phytoplankton primary production estimation aiming at assessing both the magnitude and the distribution of the primary production along the water column accordingly we developed a depth resolved ann model which also provided better vertically integrated estimates than its non resolved counterpart the rationale behind the use of a ml technique lies in the advantages it provides in handling complex non linear relations which dominate natural systems lek et al 1996 olden et al 2008 scardi 1996 moreover ml approaches allow the exploitation of large amount of data in order to estimate target quantities exploitable information can be retrieved from several heterogeneous sources e g the remote sensing sammartino et al 2018 wang et al 2010 indeed no a priori explicit mathematical formulation of the link between predictive variables and the output is needed as the relationships between them are derived from the data during the model development training in ml jargon gibert et al 2018 maier and dandy 2000 this feature boosts the value of remotely sensed data which provide useful information on a global scale for these reasons ml applications in the ecology field are rising in popularity covering a wide range of topics bohan et al 2017 catucci and scardi 2020 fabbrizzi et al 2020 s franceschini et al 2019 peters et al 2014 russo et al 2011 it should be stressed that while numerous variables could be useful to estimate the primary production we used only predictors that can be acquired by remote sensing in both mattei et al 2018 and the present study in order to enhance the practical value of the model indeed the exclusive use of this type of predictors in combination with the abovementioned depth resolved approach allowed us to expand the two dimensional view from satellite images to an estimated three dimensional distribution of phytoplankton primary production that could only be obtained from time consuming and expensive sampling campaigns primary production appraisals are relevant not only for fostering the understanding of the dynamics of this process from both a temporal and a spatial perspective but also for the analysis of several ecological processes among the research fields linked to phytoplankton primary production we can highlight the assessment of natural capital and ecosystem services buonocore et al 2019 costanza et al 1997 melaku canu et al 2015 richardson and schoeman 2004 the climate change effects on related biological processes and ecosystem services blanchard et al 2012 barange et al 2014 maureaud et al 2017 behrenfeld et al 2006 the management of fishery resources chassot et al 2010 conti and scardi 2010 nixon 1992 russo et al 2019 and the understanding of marine food webs dynamics l hunt and mckinnell 2006 shurin jonathan b et al 2006 phytoplankton primary production is among the most important processes to be considered in ecological studies but the uncertainty in the available estimates from 49 to 60 gt c y 1 according to carr et al 2006 points out the importance of enhancing their quality 1 2 goal and novelty of the study the goal of this study was to boost the quality of phytoplankton primary production estimates from both a numerical accuracy and an ecological perspective accordingly we tried to embed ecological knowledge into the ann training procedure in order to obtain a biologically coherent output from a standard data driven learning procedure in fact we believe that ml algorithms are tools which could be adapted to the modelers needs thus enhancing the output value of a model it should be stressed that reproducing the high variability of the vertical phytoplankton profiles is one of the main challenges for modeling approaches in order to achieve these objectives we defined several training customizations on the basis of both theoretical and data derived ecological knowledge about primary production the latter was obtained from the analysis of the available production profiles a constrained training methodology for anns was presented by scardi 2001 in the latter work only one criterion was tested it was restricted to a depth integrated perspective and it did not directly affect the training procedure moreover we also explored the rationale of ecological sound procedures in a sensitivity analysis work simone franceschini et al 2019 in this framework we wanted to improve the performances of a depth resolved model which already outperformed the abovementioned vertically integrated ann model accordingly we exploited both the structure of the vertically resolved ann model and the larger amount of records available at different depths to develop three different training customizations each algorithm customization acts on a different phase of the ann training procedure the algorithm used and customized in this work was a classic error back propagation ebp rumelhart et al 1986 the performances of the different ecologically sound models developed in this work were compared from a depth resolved and a depth integrated perspective subsequently the results of the customizations presented in this paper were compared to the ones of its conventional counterpart i e trained with a standard ebp algorithm from both a depth resolved and a depth integrated perspective as far as we know the proposed methodology is a novelty in the application of artificial neural networks to ecological modeling similar approaches are already integrated in training algorithms such as rprop m riedmiller and braun 1993 m a riedmiller and braun 1993 but none is based on ecological knowledge we believe that the reasoning behind the approaches presented in this work could be helpful for enhancing the quality of estimates in other ecological fields which exploit ml techniques in fact standard algorithms only aim at the numerical accuracy of the predictions while we also want to produce estimates that can be regarded as high quality from an ecological perspective this is especially true for ecological applications in which data paucity and measurements uncertainties could be mitigated by embedding theoretical knowledge in the model training 2 materials and methods 2 1 data description the data set used for this work was obtained from the ocean productivity web site http www science oregonstate edu ocean productivity field data c14 online php it included 3304 vertical profiles of phytoplankton primary production which were acquired during oceanographic cruises carried out from 1954 to 1994 these data represent the most comprehensive source of information about primary production and thus they were exploited several times in model development starting from behrenfeld and falkowski 1997 the geographical data distribution was not balanced in fact the bulk of the sampling stations was located in three regions the most represented one was the north western atlantic off the coast of united states followed by the eastern equatorial pacific off the western coast of south america and the last one was off the west coast of the united states the other areas of the oceans were mostly under sampled if sampled at all an unbalanced data availability negatively affects the generality of any type of model especially empirical ones for this reason our ann model was validated only in the areas showed in fig 1 on the other hand one of the pros of ml techniques lies in their easy update procedure through new training as soon as more data become available phytoplankton production was expressed in this data set as 14c assimilation measured by in situ sunlight incubation mg cm 3 day 1 this type of production measurements represents the majority of the data related to this biological process and thus they are an extremely valuable source of information the best approximation of the 14c assimilation measurements distribution along the water column was the target of our study i e the expected output of our models within the set of variables collected during the abovementioned cruises we exploited only the ones that could be remotely sensed the following variables have been used surface chlorophyll a concentration which can be interpreted as a proxy for phytoplankton biomass sea surface temperature and surface downwelling irradiance these variables were obtained by standard fluorometric methods immersion probes and quantum sensors respectively in addition to the satellite retrievable predictors we selected geographic coordinates and sampling date as input variables for our ann model it should be noted that the information conveyed by date and latitude was not directly passed to the ann in order to exploit such predictors we applied to both of them a trigonometric transformation which produced two derived variables for the date and two for the latitude this procedure allowed us to map those variables on a circle via their sine and cosine components thus closing the gap between january 1st and december 31st with respect to the date and between 180 west and 180 east as to the latitude table 1 the predictive variables were selected considering the ecological knowledge about phytoplankton production process and the availability of these measures through remote sensing the latter feature allowed the use of the model on a wide spatial scale removing the need of expensive and time consuming sampling procedures finally it should be stressed that we used the same predictors exploited in mattei et al 2018 in order to analyze the effects of the proposed training algorithm customizations 2 2 data management since the quality of the available data is paramount in the development of a model especially if an empirical technique is chosen we performed an extensive check on the ecological consistency of several features related to the production profiles the performed data management procedures will be summarized in the following paragraph and we refer to mattei et al 2018 for further details since the exploited data set was the same one one of the main characteristics that we took into account to analyze the biological consistency of a phytoplankton primary production vertical profile was its production to biomass ratio p b indeed an extremely high or low value of this ratio could represent either a measurement error during sampling or the effect of an unusual water column status which could occur in the transition process from a stable state to another one accordingly those records were filtered out from the data set in order to avoid both the addition of noise due to human errors and a loss of generality due to the inclusion of transitory environmental conditions moreover we evaluated the coherence of the environmental predictive variables i e sea surface temperature and surface downwelling irradiance by considering the spatio temporal context in which they were gathered furthermore we invested a great deal of effort in the management of the missing data from the previously mentioned predictors since data paucity is one of the main problems hindering ecological studies missing irradiance values were obtained by interpolation of existing data whenever filling the gaps in our records was possible as for sea surface temperature we also favored interpolation but when it was not feasible we retrieved estimates for the missing information from external data sets data retrieved from http neo sci gsfc nasa gov view php datasetid myd28m the data pre processing importance is twofold in fact if biased profiles had been incorporated in the ann training both the ecological soundness of the model and its ability to generalize could have been compromised the second reason pertains to the amount and the quality of available information which are paramount aspects in model development studies the latter two features where either checked or boosted by data biological consistency analysis and missing data management phytoplankton production measurements were carried out at fixed optical depths thus the phytoplankton profiles were characterized by different sampling depths in order to adapt the data to our ann architecture we managed the production profiles such that each profile was represented by the same set of standard depths along the water column i e 0 m 5 m 10 m 20 m 40 m and 60 m primary production at these depths were estimated by weighted average between the immediately upper and lower optical depths furthermore since the last sampling point in each phytoplankton profile was set at 1 of the surface irradiance we assumed that no net production occurred below this depth therefore every standard depth deeper than the last sampled optical depth was associated with a null primary production value during the standardization process after this process we found that 56 and 75 of the profiles in our dataset showed null production respectively at 40 m and 60 m finally we generated several virtual observations n 888 by duplicating profiles from poorly sampled regions and by perturbing them with a small amount of gaussian noise i e 0 05 0 05 scardi et al 2008 these virtual observations play a crucial role in balancing the data set thus allowing to achieve the maximum degree of generality in the ann training the final version of our data set comprised 3087 phytoplankton primary production profiles the data were split into a training set 1852 profiles a validation set 618 profiles and a test set 616 profiles respectively in order to train apply the early stopping criterion during the training section 2 4 and test our ann model the abovementioned data splitting procedure was not achieved by a standard random pattern selection in fact a stratified procedure was applied by sorting the profiles according to their geographic position date and magnitude of the vertically integrated primary production subsequently three records in each group of five were randomly assigned to the training set while the remaining two were randomly assigned to the validation and test set respectively this procedure allowed to create three data subsets as balanced as possible with respect to the main sources of variation in phytoplankton primary production the last stage of data pre processing involved the normalization of the data into the 0 03 0 97 interval an interval slightly narrower than 0 1 was chosen to avoid the tails of the sigmoid activation function thus speeding up the training procedure moreover we applied a logarithmic transformation to primary production records in order to avoid the effect that very high values could exert on the mse during the ann training this choice was supported by empirical tests carried out both in this work and in previous ones which involved anns and primary production estimation scardi and harding 1999 2 3 software we developed the software used to perform our customized training procedures see section 2 4 2 5 in fortran 90 and compiled the source code with the gfortran 4 10 0 compiler the size of these programs is in the range of few kb and we named them on the basis of the applied customization i e sp ann de ann lrm ann for the single peak the depth weighted error and the variable learning rate and momentum procedure respectively the abovementioned programs a pseudocode that assists the comprehension of how the customized training procedures work and a set of instructions to use our software are available in the supplementary materials moreover we provided two python scripts to both perform all the data pre processing steps and obtain the estimates from a given set of ann synaptic weights finally we included the synaptic weights used in this work these weights coupled with the provided programs allow a guided use of the models presented in this paper 2 4 ann training the models were trained with our tailored versions of the classic error back propagation algorithm ebp developed by rumelhart et al 1986 a sigmoid activation function f a 1 1 e a was used for both the hidden and the output layer in this study we wanted to assess the potential accuracy enhancement provided by an ecologically sound training procedure therefore we kept the ann architecture unaltered compared to the one used in mattei et al 2018 except for the number of nodes in the hidden layer to this scope we used both the same eight input variables and the same output configuration i e six output nodes which provided the primary production estimates at six fixed depths the rationale for using only a single hidden layer for our ann model relies on the assumption that by using an adequate number of hidden nodes this kind of model should be able to approximate any function hornik et al 1989 as previously stated we aimed at developing a general model which could reproduce the production profiles variability represented in our data set in order to achieve such objective several techniques were applied during the training procedure accordingly we tried to minimize the probability of patterns memorization using the training for pattern strategy in which only a randomly selected subset i e 50 of the training patterns was available at each epoch for updating the weights furthermore we used a jittering procedure györgyi 1990 which consists in adding a small amount of gaussian noise μ 0 σ 0 01 to each input value before passing it to the ann inputs this is useful not only to avoid memorization but also to focus the learning efforts on reproducing the relationship between inputs and outputs in spite of noisy data in fact by using the jittering we simulated a large number of patterns similar to the original ones associated with the same phytoplankton primary production profile finally we used an early stopping strategy based on the minimization of the mean square error mse relative to the validation set as stopping criterion for the training phase we analyzed the validation set mse throughout the training epochs and when it stopped decreasing inverting its initial trend the ann training was interrupted the abovementioned inversion in the mse trend was interpreted as a sign of a decreased ability to generalize we performed several training procedures to optimize parameters such as learning rate and momentum with the exception for the variable learning rate and momentum procedure which will be discussed in section 2 4 solutions showing the lowest mse value for the validation set were considered the best ones these tests were performed for a number of hidden nodes ranging from one half to twice the input variables i e 4 to 16 and for each applied customization furthermore we analyzed the performances from both a depth integrated and a depth resolved production perspective and the error distribution of the best solution for each hidden layer configuration this allowed to find the most accurate model with higher accuracy and to highlight whether a bias was present or not in the production estimates on the basis of these procedures we chose the best ann among the trained ones the architecture chosen for each solution will be presented in section 2 5 2 5 customizations single peak filter depth weighted error deltas computation variable learning rate and momentum lr m as stated in the introduction section our main goal was to produce an ecologically sound model which in turn would return high quality estimates not only from a numerical accuracy perspective but also from a biological point of view to this scope we customized the standard ebp algorithm by including ecologically based rules into the training procedure we developed three different criteria to guide the learning procedure and each of them affected a different phase of the training procedure fig 2 the first training customization the single peak constraint penalizes the solutions presenting more than one peak in the estimated phytoplankton profile it acted after the synaptic weights updating procedure specifically after a training epoch when the vector of weights is used to perform prediction on the validation set in this phase the updated set of weights could either outperform the previous one if mse keeps decreasing for both the training and validation set or trigger the early stopping criterion if mse keeps decreasing for the training set only while it increases for the validation set the single peak constraint iteratively checks for the validation set the presence of more than one peak in the estimated phytoplankton primary production distribution along the water column if the single peak assumption is violated the error associated with the non conform pattern is artificially augmented mse of the multi peak profile mse multiplier we empirically tested a set of penalization multipliers comprised in the range 1 1 2 5 and the best one resulted to be 1 25 applying this procedure the total validation mse is not only affected by the numerical accuracy of the predictions but also by their conformity to the constraining criterion this type of customization could be seen as a selection tool in which the more a solution diverged from the expected behavior the more it was penalized thus resulting to be a sub optimal one the rationale behind this criterion relies on the assumption that a double peak situation is either the result of a transient state of the primary production profile or a sampling error it should be stressed that both cases represent sub optimal solutions for a model that aims at generality the empirical tests on this constraint led to an optimal number of hidden nodes equals to 11 the second customization similarly to the first one exploited the depth resolved nature of our model and the ann architecture to implement a procedure that boosted the ecological soundness of our model indeed we applied a depth weighted error to the delta computation during the backward phase of the ebp algorithm accordingly the first three outputs which were related to the three shallower depths were associated with an error multiplier higher than the second three outputs indeed we carried out several tests in order to establish an optimal set of multipliers that could properly convert our rationale into a training customization procedure the empirically chosen multipliers 2 1 5 1 3 1 0 8 0 7 were associated with the 0 m 5 m 10 m 20 m 40 m 60 m respectively these error coefficients directly affected the ann weights update by influencing the delta computation during the training phase the development of this procedure was driven by both ecological and data knowledge in fact from an ecological perspective a higher share of phytoplankton production is associated with shallower depths due to a higher irradiance level which is a strong driver of this biological process moreover in coastal zones the upper layers are also richer in nutrients which could be provided by the terrestrial inputs on the other hand while analyzing our data set we found that on average 50 of the production in each profile was confined within the first 10 m the selected ann architecture for this solution was characterized by 15 nodes in the hidden layer the third customization that we applied to the ebp algorithm aimed at exploiting the information provided by the vertical integration of the production profiles indeed the information about the phytoplankton production from an integrated perspective could be a valuable tool to guide the ann learning accordingly we performed an integration of the estimated profile after the forward phase of a training set pattern thus computing its estimated depth integrated production subsequently we compared the latter estimation with the expected value which was derived by integrating the in situ measurements gathered along the water column and computed their difference afterwards we converted the module of this difference in a percentage of the observed depth integrated production e g if the observed integrated production was equal to 1000 mg c m 2 day 1 and the estimated one was equal to 1200 mg c m 2 day 1 then the module of their difference was 200 mg c m 2 day 1 which corresponded to the 20 of the observed integrated production finally the percentage was passed as argument to a sigmoid function f a 1 1 e k x x 0 which returned in output a value that we used as learning rate value for the considered pattern the momentum parameter value was selected by subtracting the learning rate to 1 momentum 1 learning rate it should be noted that the larger the percentage the higher the resulting learning rate value as a result we enhanced the importance of the patterns which were more distant from the desired output in updating the weights during the learning procedure in fact a high value of learning rate boosts the influence of the current pattern on the weights update while the momentum enhances the importance of the previous update we found that in this case 10 was the optimal number of hidden nodes several similar solutions could be developed and tested to apply such customization to the training procedures we applied the solution that in our opinion best fitted both our dataset and our goals 2 6 model performances assessment once all the different ecologically sound anns were trained we assessed their performances relative to the test set from both a depth resolved and a depth integrated production perspective we used the mse and the determination coefficient r2 as accuracy measures moreover we analyzed the differences between the models trained with the customized algorithms and their conventional depth resolved counterpart mattei et al 2018 table 2 thus highlighting the effects of a training procedure driven by ecological knowledge finally we took into account the distribution of the differences between predicted and observed phytoplankton primary production to highlight whether the estimates were affected by a systematic bias or not the anns performances evaluation was carried out on raw values i e mg c m 3 day 1 and mg c m 2 day 1 for the depth resolved and the depth integrated estimates respectively this allowed us to analyze both the error and the accuracy of the estimates on the actual scale used in studies on phytoplankton primary production e g conti and scardi 2010 in this way we conveyed in a more straightforward way the quality of our appraisals with respect to indexes computed on log transformed values finally we tested whether or not the performance differences in terms of overall determination coefficient between the customized solutions and the classic ebp were statistically significant through a wilcoxon test wilcoxon 1945 the test was performed on 100 random data subsamples each of which contained 66 of the original data these subsamples were used to train and test one ann for each solution i e the classic ebp the single peak constraint the depth weighted error and the variable learning rate and momentum 3 results and discussion our main goal was to develop an empirical model for the estimation of the phytoplankton primary production based on a ml technique and to show how the algorithms that supported such approaches could be customized in order to obtain better estimates among the various techniques we chose an ann since this approach already showed good results in modeling the marine phytoplankton primary production scardi 2001 moreover anns are robust with respect to potential noise affecting data which is always to be expected when phytoplankton production data are taken into account given that the in situ measurement of this information is a challenging process scardi 2001 1996 scardi and harding 1999 furthermore the ann approach grants an output which is continuous over the data space the latter feature is crucial for regression models aimed at estimating processes like the primary production on the other hand the ebp algorithm customization has been carried out through several customization applied to the training phase the performances of the tailored procedures from both a depth resolved and a depth integrated perspective were analyzed and compared among them and with the conventional version of the model i e trained with the standard ebp algorithm the performance assessment for each solution presented in this work was carried on a data subset i e the test set which was never showed to the anns during the training procedure 3 1 anns performances 3 1 1 single peak constraint filter the first customization that we applied penalizes the solutions which from a depth resolved perspective showed more than one peak in the vertical distribution of the phytoplankton primary production fig 3 a shows the observed vs estimated profile values in which data from all the fixed depths from 0 m to 60 m are represented the cloud of points follows the concordance diagonal and the values are almost symmetrically scattered around it the overall r2 associated with this solution was equal to 0 682 and the mse was equal to 1051 23 while the scatterplot was a useful representation in order to show the concordance between observed and estimated values the histogram of the error distribution was aimed at analyzing whether a systematic bias in the estimates was present or not the overall error distribution was symmetrical and it showed neither the tendency to underestimate nor to overestimate primary production fig 3b indeed the mean error was less than the 1 of the primary production maximum value and the median error was nearly zero mean 3 97 mg c m 3 day 1 median 0 01 mg c m 3 day 1 furthermore in fig 3b the 5th 38 06 mg c m 3 day 1 and the 95th 18 81 mg c m 3 day 1 percentiles were highlighted in order to show the range in which the 95 of the differences fell the accuracy of the model expressed as r2 was not homogeneous along the water column and this feature was shared by all the tested solutions as shown in table 3 for the single peak constraint the determination coefficients for the six fixed depths i e 0 m 5 m 10 m 20 m 40 m 60 m were respectively 0 652 0 671 0 508 0 136 0 283 0 421 although this difference in the explained variance when we analyzed the error distribution of each output no bias was detected in fact the range of the mean output values 0 28 9 06 mg c m 3 day 1 i e up to 0 82 of the maximum production value roughly 1101 89 mg c m 3 day 1 and all the median values were close to zero outputs median range 0 0 81 mg c m 3 day 1 table 3 the rationale behind this criterion was based on the assumption that profiles characterized by more than one production peak represented either a transient state of the water column or an error during the sampling procedures since we aimed at developing a model with a large degree of generality we decided that neither the former nor the latter scenarios that could have led to a multiple peak production profile were in accordance with our goal accordingly we increased the measured validation error associated with the estimated profiles which did not comply with our criterion see section 2 4 therefore the solutions which strongly violated the constraint exhibited a larger error with respect to those which were more compliant with it since the best solution after a training epoch was chosen on the basis of its accuracy on the validation set this procedure acted as a selection tool for the synaptic weights configuration that not only had a good numerical accuracy but also respected the constraint from a depth integrated production perspective the model explained roughly the 62 of the variance r2 0 628 and the mse value was equal to 257 203 90 the scatter plot in fig 4 a showed a good concordance but a slight tendency to overestimate low values and underestimate extremely high ones the distribution of the deviations fig 4b was symmetrical and while in this case the mean was strongly influenced by extreme values mean 77 20 mg c m 2 day 1 the median was more balanced median 17 92 mg c m 2 day 1 the 5th and 95th percentiles which contained the 90 of the differences were respectively 982 11 mg c m 2 day 1 and 475 35 mg c m 2 day 1 it is worth stressing that the single peak constraint did not directly affect the estimation of the depth integrated production nonetheless the higher ecological soundness of the depth resolved model which was conferred by the selection tool described in this paragraph in turn resulted in a higher level of accuracy from a depth integrated point of view with respect to the standard ebp version table 2 this feature clearly showed how the selection of the solution which resulted to be the most compliant with a theoretical sound shape of the vertical distribution of the phytoplankton production positively affected also the numerical accuracy of the depth integrated estimates 3 1 2 depth weighted error delta computation as for the previous algorithm customization the second criterion that we developed exploited the depth resolved nature of our approach in order to drive the ann training in fact we applied a depth weighted error according to which the three shallower depths i e 0 5 10 m were associated with an error multiplier higher than that for the following outputs i e 20 40 60 m thus enhancing the importance of the former with respect to the latter the error coefficients applied to the six fixed depths were respectively 2 1 5 1 3 1 0 8 0 7 these multipliers influenced the delta computation during the back propagation phase therefore this customization of the ebp algorithm directly affected the procedure that updated the ann weights the overall concordance between observed and estimated depth resolved phytoplankton production is showed in fig 5 a and it could be summarized by an r squared value of 0 679 and an mse equal to 1060 46 the cloud of data points fig 5a clearly followed the unit slope line graphically showing the good concordance expressed by the determination coefficient the error distribution is symmetrical and 90 of the deviations were comprised in a small range i e 35 97 17 80 mg c m 3 day 1 the mean error was smaller than 1 of the maximum production value and the median was equal to zero mean 3 62 mg c m 3 day 1 median 0 mg c m 3 day 1 the specific indexes for each fixed depth are listed in the table 4 the r2 ranged from 0 078 for the 20 m depth to 0 674 for the 10 m one even in this case the mean and the median of the error distribution showed an unbiased distribution mean range 7 05 0 19 mg c m 3 day 1 median range 0 30 0 01 mg c m 3 day 1 the development of this customization was driven by both theoretical and data derived ecological knowledge indeed we wanted to exploit the previous mentioned sources of information in order to influence the weight update during the training procedure it should be noted that the higher the depth associated with a specific ann output the lower the error multiplier this feature reflected our choice to indirectly enhance the importance of the shallower depths in determining the weights update by artificially boosting the error associated with them from an ecological perspective the depth weighted error followed the rationale that a higher share of phytoplankton primary production is associated with shallower depths this characteristic of the phytoplankton production is the result of the higher irradiance level which is a strong driver of primary production received by the upper zone of the water column moreover it is important to note that in coastal zones the upper layers of the water column are also richer in nutrients the latter feature could be caused by upwelling phenomena and or by external inputs of nutrients from the neighbouring terrestrial ecosystems on the other hand while analyzing our dataset we gathered further information that supported the decision to attribute more importance to the shallower depths with respect to the deeper ones during the ann training in fact we found that on average 50 of the primary production in each phytoplankton profile was confined within the first 10 m which corresponded to the first three outputs of our depth resolved model this customization not only allowed to embed theoretical knowledge in the ann learning phase but also enhanced the value of the dataset for the model training this procedure in turn translated a feature of our data in a customized criterion for the weights update as to the depth integrated production the depth weighted error procedure showed a good accuracy from estimated and observed integrated angle expressed as raw values r2 0 626 mse 259 006 60 fig 6 a the error distribution is roughly symmetrical although its mean seemed to be strongly affected by extreme values mean 84 04 mg c m 2 day 1 on the other hand the median value resulted to be very close zero median 2 99 mg c m 2 day 1 table 4 moreover 90 of the differences was comprised in the 890 75 471 58 range fig 6b it ought to be noted that even in this case the appraisal of the production from an integrated perspective was not directly affected by the customization nevertheless the enhanced importance attributed to the shallower depths in determining the weights update led to an increased accuracy with respect to the conventional version of the model the reason behind this improved accuracy in term of both r squared and mse could be justified by the higher magnitude of production that was associated with the upper zone of the water column in fact the latter zone clearly had a great impact on the depth integrated production estimate 3 1 3 variable learning rate and momentum lr m the third customization that we tested to drive the weights update aimed at exploiting the information provided by the observed integrated production obtained from the training patterns the customization applied using this criterion acted on the setting of two learning parameter that in anns jargon are known as learning rate and momentum accordingly before the back propagation phase in the ebp algorithm we computed the estimated production profile for the current pattern and compared it to the integrated production profile obtained from our data set the absolute value of the difference between these two values was then converted to a percentage of the in situ measured production the same value was passed as the argument to a sigmoid function which returned a value to be used as the learning rate for the current weights update on the other hand the momentum value was set as 1 learning rate this solution was the one that allowed explaining the larger share of variance with a determination coefficient equal to 0 696 i e roughly 70 explained variance and showed the lower mse mse 1003 75 the good fitting between observed and estimated depth resolved production values was highlighted by the points distribution fig 7 a which clearly follow the concordance diagonal and was nearly symmetrical around it as to the error distribution analysis fig 7b the deviation histogram was symmetrical and showed the lower mean value among the various tested solutions mean 2 63 mg c m 3 day 1 and a median equal to zero furthermore the 5th and the 95th percentile values 34 25 mg c m 3 day 1 and 22 34 mg c m 3 day 1 respectively showed that the 90 of the differences were comprised in a narrow range we have already stated that all the solutions did not show a homogeneous accuracy along the water column from the r squared perspective table 5 in fact the explained variance ranged from 67 7 for the 0 m output to 11 3 for the 20 m output on the other hand while analysing the mean and median values of the error distribution for each output we found that the difference in the accuracy was not as strong as the determination coefficient suggested table 5 indeed the mean error range was 4 85 0 27 mg c m 3 day 1 while the median one was 0 55 0 90 mg c m 3 day 1 it is worth noting that we developed this training criterion in order to exploit a paramount information present in our dataset that otherwise would not be included in the learning procedure indeed in both the conventional and customized versions of our depth resolved model the information provided by the depth integrated production did not contribute to the model development since we showed that the estimation accuracy of the integrated primary production with an ann approach could be indirectly boosted through a depth resolved approach mattei et al 2018 we tried to fully exploit the information in our data set to further improve the quality of the estimates also from a depth integrated perspective accordingly we customized the ebp algorithm aiming at enhancing the importance when updating the weights of the most challenging patterns in fact the training for patterns that showed a high difference between the estimated and expected depth integrated production were driven by high learning rate and a low momentum conversely examples showing a high concordance with the observed integrated production affected to a lesser extent the weights update i e were associated to low learning rate and high momentum in contrast with the previous two customizations the one presented in this section directly affected the estimation of the depth integrated primary production in fact the value of the expected production along the water column was exploited in the training phase therefore it is not surprising that this solution provided more accurate appraisals and explained a larger share of the variance in the estimation of the vertically integrated primary production with respect to the other models we developed r2 0 642 mse 248 060 80 fig 8 a the error distribution was symmetrical fig 8b and showed the best values for both the mean and the median which was nearly zero mean 51 91 mg c m 2 day 1 median 0 33 mg c m 2 day 1 table 5 furthermore the 5th and the 95th percentiles were computed and 90 of the differences fell in the range 891 19 537 01 mg c m 2 day 1 3 2 conventional and ecologically sound anns comparison as showed by the results presented in the previous sections all the ecologically sound versions of the model outperformed the conventional one the single peak constraint showed an overall increase in the accuracy of the estimates in term of explained variance and mse compared to the standard ebp version of the model table 2 vs table 3 this was the less invasive procedure applied to the ebp algorithm in fact it did not directly drive the weights update rather it selected among the various solutions the most strictly compliant with the chosen theoretical criterion i e the penalization of multiple peaks in vertical profiles indeed this constraint helped to reduce the space of the possible solutions limiting the potential variability of the production vertical distributions to the most ecologically sound ones this constraint by penalizing the solutions that are linked with errors or transient states of the water column could be effective in order to achieve a high degree of generality it is reasonable to assume that the reason for the augmented accuracy from both a depth integrated and a depth resolved perspective table 2 vs table 3 was the result of the good generality achieved thank to this solution as to the depth weighted error procedure it also showed an increase in the accuracy with respect to the classic ebp training table 2 vs table 4 this customization acted on a delicate phase of the ebp algorithm i e the delta computation accordingly it is possible that further tests could lead to a better exploitation of this type of customization the last customization showed the highest gain in accuracy from both a depth resolved and a depth integrated point of view outperforming all other presented approaches table 5 given the empirical nature of our model this result did not surprise us in fact in this ebp customization we found an unconventional way to convoy a larger share of information from our data set into the model training indeed the magnitude of the phytoplankton production in the whole water column was not exploited in other approaches and we thought that it could have improved the accuracy of our ann model furthermore through the variable learning rate and momentum we stressed the importance in updating the weights of those patterns whose estimated values were more distant from an optimal solution thus focussing the learning efforts on the most challenging examples furthermore achieving high quality estimates from a depth integrated perspective is paramount not only for the understanding of the primary production dynamics but also for related studies which exploit such estimates for several purposes conti and scardi 2010 franzese et al 2017 reuer et al 2007 russo et al 2019 as stated in section 3 1 the performances expressed as r2 decreased along the water column exception made for the last two outputs on the other hand when other statistics were taken into account the differences were substantially lower tables 2 to 5 this feature could depend on the high degree of variability associated with a specific depth such as the 20 m output which ranges from 0 to 281 58 mg c m 3 day 1 moreover the deeper layers of the water column are usually associated with lower production values which exert a lower influence on the weight update during the training procedure furthermore the link between the predictive variables and the model outputs weakened with depth since we used only surface predictors conversely the apparent inversion of this tendency for the last two standard depths could only be justified by their low variability in fact as stated in section 2 2 over the 75 of the production profiles showed null production associated with this area of the water column regardless this characteristic it should be stressed that the higher share of phytoplankton production was associated with the shallower depths accordingly a higher accuracy in the latter zone of the water column was paramount in the estimation of the phytoplankton primary production as stated in section 2 6 we tested the statistical significance of the performance difference in terms of overall r2 between the classic and the customized algorithms through the wilcoxon test we found that the accuracy of the depth weighted error and the variable learning rate customizations was significantly higher than the classic ebp version p values 2 06 10 11 and 5 42 10 10 respectively on the other hand the single peak constraint accuracy was not significantly different with respect to the conventional model nevertheless we think that the single peak procedure enhanced the ecological quality of the estimates reducing the less ecologically consistent profiles even if the numerical accuracy was not significantly improved this customization is the less invasive one it only filtered the solutions once the weights update were performed and it can be used in combination with the other customizations which directly affect the weights update it ought to be noted that even when the accuracy raise was moderate from a numerical perspective the ecological quality of the estimates should be taken into account in fact we aimed not only at enhancing the accuracy of the estimates but also at achieving better performances through a boosted ecological consistency of the primary production appraisals moreover the conventional version of the model already proved to be a good solution from a numerical accuracy perspective therefore even a moderate improvement in the accuracy coupled with an enhancement of the biological soundness of the model could be regarded as an important result from a more general viewpoint we wanted to highlight how ml algorithms should be treated as tools in the hands of a modeler we tested three different approaches to customize a classic ebp algorithm for a specific task i e phytoplankton primary production our goal was to show how theoretical and data derived knowledge could be embedded in a training procedure in order to enhance the quality of a model output furthermore we believe that the rationale behind our work i e customizing a learning phase through theoretical knowledge could be effective not only in a primary production modelling framework but also in a broader one in fact our results suggest that a customized approach to ann model development could lead to an improvement in the quality of estimates from both a theoretical and a numerical point of view 4 conclusions this paper aims at highlighting how anns as well as other ml algorithms could be tailored to better fit the modeler needs achieving better results not only from a numerical point of view but also from an application specific perspective we presented three different approaches aimed at enhancing the ecological soundness of ann models through the customization of the classic ebp algorithm to achieve such an objective we defined three different customizations that once applied to the training procedure allowed us to embed theoretical and data derived ecological knowledge in our models from a numerical perspective the accuracy improvement with respect to the classic ebp version of the model mattei et al 2018 was not large since the paramount requirement for empirical models is the amount and the quality of the available data this is especially true when a process which is highly variable on spatial and temporal scale such as the phytoplankton primary production is taken into account nevertheless all the anns trained with an ecologically sound strategy performed better than their conventional counterpart thus showing that our approach improved the quality of the phytoplankton primary production estimates furthermore the higher quality of the estimates achieved thanks to the customizations we presented could in turn positively affect the results of the studies which are related to the primary production appraisals we suggest that the rationale proposed in this paper could be repurposed in similar modeling applications and that it is likely to lead to improved model performances it is important to stress how ml algorithms are widely open to such type of customizations and we believe that this should be the way forward for the application of these powerful tools in highly specific tasks declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

24887,enhancing the understanding of marine phytoplankton primary production is paramount due to the relationships with oceanic food webs energy fluxes carbon cycle and earth s climate as field measurements of this process are both expensive and time consuming indirect approaches which can estimate primary production from remotely sensed imagery are the only viable large scale solution we boosted the quality of phytoplankton primary production estimates with respect to a previously developed model by embedding ecological knowledge into the training of an artificial neural network in order to achieve this goal we drove the training procedure on the basis of both theoretical and data derived ecological knowledge about phytoplankton primary production a single peak constraint exploits the theoretical knowledge about the vertical shape of the production profile a depth weighted error procedure was based on available information about the production magnitude along the water column a variable learning rate and momentum approach allowed to better exploit the available data to train our artificial neural network thanks to this customized procedure we improved the quality of the primary production estimates from both a theoretical and a numerical point of view accordingly the new artificial neural networks not only provided ecologically sounder estimates but also explained up to 4 more variance with respect to the traditional error back propagation solution this result was achieved exclusively through an ecologically driven customization of the basic algorithm since the dataset and predictive variables were the same utilized in the conventional counterpart trained with a classic error back propagation algorithm we suggest that the proposed rationale could lead to improved performances in similar modelling applications keywords marine phytoplankton primary production artificial neural networks machine learning ecologically sound training customized algorithm 1 introduction 1 1 scientific background oceans cover roughly 70 of the earth s surface enhancing the understanding of their physical and biological dynamics is therefore paramount costanza 1999 kildow and mcilgorm 2010 in this context marine phytoplankton plays a pivotal role since it accounts for the bulk of the whole oceanic primary production duarte and cebrián 1996 accordingly it is intimately linked to the carbon cycle and it influences the ocean atmosphere interactions through a net carbon dioxide uptake by the water column caldeira and duffy 2000 holland heinrich d 2006 sabine et al 2004 moreover a share of this fixed carbon is removed from the fast carbon cycle through sinking of organic matter in a process known as biological pump longhurst and glen harrison 1989 furthermore since the phytoplankton constitutes the first trophic level in the marine environment the production expressed by its photosynthetic organisms represents the main source of energy supporting the marine food webs anderson et al 2018 richardson and schoeman 2004 therefore phytoplankton primary production deeply influences not only the characteristics of the marine ecosystems and in turn the respective ecosystem services cloern et al 2014 costanza et al 1997 hattam et al 2015 but also earth s climate behrenfeld et al 2016 hays et al 2005 indirect approaches for estimating the phytoplankton production have raised in popularity as field measurements are expensive and time consuming especially on a large spatial scale clark et al 2001 low décarie et al 2014 several techniques have been applied to model the phytoplankton primary production in order to assess its spatial and temporal variability on a global scale according to the classification proposed by campbell et al 2002 modelling attempts range from depth and wave integrated to depth and wave resolved estimators it should be noted that several comparison studies of primary production models were carried out in the primary productivity algorithm round robin pparr framework campbell et al 2002 carr et al 2006 lee et al 2015 saba et al 2011 the main focus of the pparr was to provide a common context in which the main features and differences among the various techniques could be assessed this framework was extremely valuable for all the researchers involved in the study of the phytoplankton production in fact in this context both strengths and weaknesses of the different models were highlighted thus helping to define directions for further improvements among the compared models only one was based on a machine learning ml approach i e a depth integrated artificial neural network ann scardi 2001 in mattei et al 2018 we resumed the use of anns for the phytoplankton primary production estimation aiming at assessing both the magnitude and the distribution of the primary production along the water column accordingly we developed a depth resolved ann model which also provided better vertically integrated estimates than its non resolved counterpart the rationale behind the use of a ml technique lies in the advantages it provides in handling complex non linear relations which dominate natural systems lek et al 1996 olden et al 2008 scardi 1996 moreover ml approaches allow the exploitation of large amount of data in order to estimate target quantities exploitable information can be retrieved from several heterogeneous sources e g the remote sensing sammartino et al 2018 wang et al 2010 indeed no a priori explicit mathematical formulation of the link between predictive variables and the output is needed as the relationships between them are derived from the data during the model development training in ml jargon gibert et al 2018 maier and dandy 2000 this feature boosts the value of remotely sensed data which provide useful information on a global scale for these reasons ml applications in the ecology field are rising in popularity covering a wide range of topics bohan et al 2017 catucci and scardi 2020 fabbrizzi et al 2020 s franceschini et al 2019 peters et al 2014 russo et al 2011 it should be stressed that while numerous variables could be useful to estimate the primary production we used only predictors that can be acquired by remote sensing in both mattei et al 2018 and the present study in order to enhance the practical value of the model indeed the exclusive use of this type of predictors in combination with the abovementioned depth resolved approach allowed us to expand the two dimensional view from satellite images to an estimated three dimensional distribution of phytoplankton primary production that could only be obtained from time consuming and expensive sampling campaigns primary production appraisals are relevant not only for fostering the understanding of the dynamics of this process from both a temporal and a spatial perspective but also for the analysis of several ecological processes among the research fields linked to phytoplankton primary production we can highlight the assessment of natural capital and ecosystem services buonocore et al 2019 costanza et al 1997 melaku canu et al 2015 richardson and schoeman 2004 the climate change effects on related biological processes and ecosystem services blanchard et al 2012 barange et al 2014 maureaud et al 2017 behrenfeld et al 2006 the management of fishery resources

production is among the most important processes to be considered in ecological studies but the uncertainty in the available estimates from 49 to 60 gt c y 1 according to carr et al 2006 points out the importance of enhancing their quality 1 2 goal and novelty of the study the goal of this study was to boost the quality of phytoplankton primary production estimates from both a numerical accuracy and an ecological perspective accordingly we tried to embed ecological knowledge into the ann training procedure in order to obtain a biologically coherent output from a standard data driven learning procedure in fact we believe that ml algorithms are tools which could be adapted to the modelers needs thus enhancing the output value of a model it should be stressed that reproducing the high variability of the vertical phytoplankton profiles is one of the main challenges for modeling approaches in order to achieve these objectives we defined several training customizations on the basis of both theoretical and data derived ecological knowledge about primary production the latter was obtained from the analysis of the available production profiles a constrained training methodology for anns was presented by scardi 2001 in the latter work only one criterion was tested it was restricted to a depth integrated perspective and it did not directly affect the training procedure moreover we also explored the rationale of ecological sound procedures in a sensitivity analysis work simone franceschini et al 2019 in this framework we wanted to improve the performances of a depth resolved model which already outperformed the abovementioned vertically integrated ann model accordingly we exploited both the structure of the vertically resolved ann model and the larger amount of records available at different depths to develop three different training customizations each algorithm customization acts on a different phase of the ann training procedure the algorithm used and customized in this work was a classic error back propagation ebp rumelhart et al 1986 the performances of the different ecologically sound models developed in this work were compared from a depth resolved and a depth integrated perspective subsequently the results of the customizations presented in this paper were compared to the ones of its conventional counterpart i e trained with a standard ebp algorithm from both a depth resolved and a depth integrated perspective as far as we know the proposed methodology is a novelty in the application of artificial neural networks to ecological modeling similar approaches are already integrated in training algorithms such as rprop m riedmiller and braun 1993 m a riedmiller and braun 1993 but none is based on ecological knowledge we believe that the reasoning behind the approaches presented in this work could be helpful for enhancing the quality of estimates in other ecological fields which exploit ml techniques in fact standard algorithms only aim at the numerical accuracy of the predictions while we also want to produce estimates that can be regarded as high quality from an ecological perspective this is especially true for ecological applications in which data paucity and measurements uncertainties could be mitigated by embedding theoretical knowledge in the model training 2 materials and methods 2 1 data description the data set used for this work was obtained from the ocean productivity web site http www science oregonstate edu ocean productivity field data c14 online php it included 3304 vertical profiles of phytoplankton primary production which were acquired during oceanographic cruises carried out from 1954 to 1994 these data represent the most comprehensive source of information about primary production and thus they were exploited several times in model development starting from behrenfeld and falkowski 1997 the geographical data distribution was not balanced in fact the bulk of the sampling stations was located in three regions the most represented one was the north western atlantic off the coast of united states followed by the eastern equatorial pacific off the western coast of south america and the last one was off the west coast of the united states the other areas of the oceans were mostly under sampled if sampled at all an unbalanced data availability negatively affects the generality of any type of model especially empirical ones for this reason our ann model was validated only in the areas showed in fig 1 on the other hand one of the pros of ml techniques lies in their easy update procedure through new training as soon as more data become available phytoplankton production was expressed in this data set as 14c assimilation measured by in situ sunlight incubation mg cm 3 day 1 this type of production measurements represents the majority of the data related to this biological process and thus they are an extremely valuable source of information the best approximation of the 14c assimilation measurements distribution along the water column was the target of our study i e the expected output of our models within the set of variables collected during the abovementioned cruises we exploited only the ones that could be remotely sensed the following variables have been used surface chlorophyll a concentration which can be interpreted as a proxy for phytoplankton biomass sea surface temperature and surface downwelling irradiance these variables were obtained by standard fluorometric methods immersion probes and quantum sensors respectively in addition to the satellite retrievable predictors we selected geographic coordinates and sampling date as input variables for our ann model it should be noted that the information conveyed by date and latitude was not directly passed to the ann in order to exploit such predictors we applied to both of them a trigonometric transformation which produced two derived variables for the date and two for the latitude this procedure allowed us to map those variables on a circle via their sine and cosine components thus closing the gap between january 1st and december 31st with respect to the date and between 180 west and 180 east as to the latitude table 1 the predictive variables were selected considering the ecological knowledge about phytoplankton production process and the availability of these measures through remote sensing the latter feature allowed the use of the model on a wide spatial scale removing the need of expensive and time consuming sampling procedures finally it should be stressed that we used the same predictors exploited in mattei et al 2018 in order to analyze the effects of the proposed training algorithm customizations 2 2 data management since the quality of the available data is paramount in the development of a model especially if an empirical technique is chosen we performed an extensive check on the ecological consistency of several features related to the production profiles the performed data management procedures will be summarized in the following paragraph and we refer to mattei et al 2018 for further details since the exploited data set was the same one one of the main characteristics that we took into account to analyze the biological consistency of a phytoplankton primary production vertical profile was its production to biomass ratio p b indeed an extremely high or low value of this ratio could represent either a measurement error during sampling or the effect of an unusual water column status which could occur in the transition process from a stable state to another one accordingly those records were filtered out from the data set in order to avoid both the addition of noise due to human errors and a loss of generality due to the inclusion of transitory environmental conditions moreover we evaluated the coherence of the environmental predictive variables i e sea surface temperature and surface downwelling irradiance by considering the spatio temporal context in which they were gathered furthermore we invested a great deal of effort in the management of the missing data from the previously mentioned predictors since data paucity is one of the main problems hindering ecological studies missing irradiance values were obtained by interpolation of existing data whenever filling the gaps in our records was possible as for sea surface temperature we also favored interpolation but when it was not feasible we retrieved estimates for the missing information from external data sets data retrieved from http neo sci gsfc nasa gov view php datasetid myd28m the data pre processing importance is twofold in fact if biased profiles had been incorporated in the ann training both the ecological soundness of the model and its ability to generalize could have been compromised the second reason pertains to the amount and the quality of available information which are paramount aspects in model development studies the latter two features where either checked or boosted by data biological consistency analysis and missing data management phytoplankton production measurements were carried out at fixed optical depths thus the phytoplankton profiles were characterized by different sampling depths in order to adapt the data to our ann architecture we managed the production profiles such that each profile was represented by the same set of standard depths along the water column i e 0 m 5 m 10 m 20 m 40 m and 60 m primary production at these depths were estimated by weighted average between the immediately upper and lower optical depths furthermore since the last sampling point in each phytoplankton profile was set at 1 of the surface irradiance we assumed that no net production occurred below this depth therefore every standard depth deeper than the last sampled optical depth was associated with a null primary production value during the standardization process after this process we found that 56 and 75 of the profiles in our dataset showed null production respectively at 40 m and 60 m finally we generated several virtual observations n 888 by duplicating profiles from poorly sampled regions and by perturbing them with a small amount of gaussian noise i e 0 05 0 05 scardi et al 2008 these virtual observations play a crucial role in balancing the data set thus allowing to achieve the maximum degree of generality in the ann training the final version of our data set comprised 3087 phytoplankton primary production profiles the data were split into a training set 1852 profiles a validation set 618 profiles and a test set 616 profiles respectively in order to train apply the early stopping criterion during the training section 2 4 and test our ann model the abovementioned data splitting procedure was not achieved by a standard random pattern selection in fact a stratified procedure was applied by sorting the profiles according to their geographic position date and magnitude of the vertically integrated primary production subsequently three records in each group of five were randomly assigned to the training set while the remaining two were randomly assigned to the validation and test set respectively this procedure allowed to create three data subsets as balanced as possible with respect to the main sources of variation in phytoplankton primary production the last stage of data pre processing involved the normalization of the data into the 0 03 0 97 interval an interval slightly narrower than 0 1 was chosen to avoid the tails of the sigmoid activation function thus speeding up the training procedure moreover we applied a logarithmic transformation to primary production records in order to avoid the effect that very high values could exert on the mse during the ann training this choice was supported by empirical tests carried out both in this work and in previous ones which involved anns and primary production estimation scardi and harding 1999 2 3 software we developed the software used to perform our customized training procedures see section 2 4 2 5 in fortran 90 and compiled the source code with the gfortran 4 10 0 compiler the size of these programs is in the range of few kb and we named them on the basis of the applied customization i e sp ann de ann lrm ann for the single peak the depth weighted error and the variable learning rate and momentum procedure respectively the abovementioned programs a pseudocode that assists the comprehension of how the customized training procedures work and a set of instructions to use our software are available in the supplementary materials moreover we provided two python scripts to both perform all the data pre processing steps and obtain the estimates from a given set of ann synaptic weights finally we included the synaptic weights used in this work these weights coupled with the provided programs allow a guided use of the models presented in this paper 2 4 ann training the models were trained with our tailored versions of the classic error back propagation algorithm ebp developed by rumelhart et al 1986 a sigmoid activation function f a 1 1 e a was used for both the hidden and the output layer in this study we wanted to assess the potential accuracy enhancement provided by an ecologically sound training procedure therefore we kept the ann architecture unaltered compared to the one used in mattei et al 2018 except for the number of nodes in the hidden layer to this scope we used both the same eight input variables and the same output configuration i e six output nodes which provided the primary production estimates at six fixed depths the rationale for using only a single hidden layer for our ann model relies on the assumption that by using an adequate number of hidden nodes this kind of model should be able to approximate any function hornik et al 1989 as previously stated we aimed at developing a general model which could reproduce the production profiles variability represented in our data set in order to achieve such objective several techniques were applied during the training procedure accordingly we tried to minimize the probability of patterns memorization using the training for pattern strategy in which only a randomly selected subset i e 50 of the training patterns was available at each epoch for updating the weights furthermore we used a jittering procedure györgyi 1990 which consists in adding a small amount of gaussian noise μ 0 σ 0 01 to each input value before passing it to the ann inputs this is useful not only to avoid memorization but also to focus the learning efforts on reproducing the relationship between inputs and outputs in spite of noisy data in fact by using the jittering we simulated a large number of patterns similar to the original ones associated with the same phytoplankton primary production profile finally we used an early stopping strategy based on the minimization of the mean square error mse relative to the validation set as stopping criterion for the training phase we analyzed the validation set mse throughout the training epochs and when it stopped decreasing inverting its initial trend the ann training was interrupted the abovementioned inversion in the mse trend was interpreted as a sign of a decreased ability to generalize we performed several training procedures to optimize parameters such as learning rate and momentum with the exception for the variable learning rate and momentum procedure which will be discussed in section 2 4 solutions showing the lowest mse value for the validation set were considered the best ones these tests were performed for a number of hidden nodes ranging from one half to twice the input variables i e 4 to 16 and for each applied customization furthermore we analyzed the performances from both a depth integrated and a depth resolved production perspective and the error distribution of the best solution for each hidden layer configuration this allowed to find the most accurate model with higher accuracy and to highlight whether a bias was present or not in the production estimates on the basis of these procedures we chose the best ann among the trained ones the architecture chosen for each solution will be presented in section 2 5 2 5 customizations single peak filter depth weighted error deltas computation variable learning rate and momentum lr m as stated in the introduction section our main goal was to produce an ecologically sound model which in turn would return high quality estimates not only from a numerical accuracy perspective but also from a biological point of view to this scope we customized the standard ebp algorithm by including ecologically based rules into the training procedure we developed three different criteria to guide the learning procedure and each of them affected a different phase of the training procedure fig 2 the first training customization the single peak constraint penalizes the solutions presenting more than one peak in the estimated phytoplankton profile it acted after the synaptic weights updating procedure specifically after a training epoch when the vector of weights is used to perform prediction on the validation set in this phase the updated set of weights could either outperform the previous one if mse keeps decreasing for both the training and validation set or trigger the early stopping criterion if mse keeps decreasing for the training set only while it increases for the validation set the single peak constraint iteratively checks for the validation set the presence of more than one peak in the estimated phytoplankton primary production distribution along the water column if the single peak assumption is violated the error associated with the non conform pattern is artificially augmented mse of the multi peak profile mse multiplier we empirically tested a set of penalization multipliers comprised in the range 1 1 2 5 and the best one resulted to be 1 25 applying this procedure the total validation mse is not only affected by the numerical accuracy of the predictions but also by their conformity to the constraining criterion this type of customization could be seen as a selection tool in which the more a solution diverged from the expected behavior the more it was penalized thus resulting to be a sub optimal one the rationale behind this criterion relies on the assumption that a double peak situation is either the result of a transient state of the primary production profile or a sampling error it should be stressed that both cases represent sub optimal solutions for a model that aims at generality the empirical tests on this constraint led to an optimal number of hidden nodes equals to 11 the second customization similarly to the first one exploited the depth resolved nature of our model and the ann architecture to implement a procedure that boosted the ecological soundness of our model indeed we applied a depth weighted error to the delta computation during the backward phase of the ebp algorithm accordingly the first three outputs which were related to the three shallower depths were associated with an error multiplier higher than the second three outputs indeed we carried out several tests in order to establish an optimal set of multipliers that could properly convert our rationale into a training customization procedure the empirically chosen multipliers 2 1 5 1 3 1 0 8 0 7 were associated with the 0 m 5 m 10 m 20 m 40 m 60 m respectively these error coefficients directly affected the ann weights update by influencing the delta computation during the training phase the development of this procedure was driven by both ecological and data knowledge in fact from an ecological perspective a higher share of phytoplankton production is associated with shallower depths due to a higher irradiance level which is a strong driver of this biological process moreover in coastal zones the upper layers are also richer in nutrients which could be provided by the terrestrial inputs on the other hand while analyzing our data set we found that on average 50 of the production in each profile was confined within the first 10 m the selected ann architecture for this solution was characterized by 15 nodes in the hidden layer the third customization that we applied to the ebp algorithm aimed at exploiting the information provided by the vertical integration of the production profiles indeed the information about the phytoplankton production from an integrated perspective could be a valuable tool to guide the ann learning accordingly we performed an integration of the estimated profile after the forward phase of a training set pattern thus computing its estimated depth integrated production subsequently we compared the latter estimation with the expected value which was derived by integrating the in situ measurements gathered along the water column and computed their difference afterwards we converted the module of this difference in a percentage of the observed depth integrated production e g if the observed integrated production was equal to 1000 mg c m 2 day 1 and the estimated one was equal to 1200 mg c m 2 day 1 then the module of their difference was 200 mg c m 2 day 1 which corresponded to the 20 of the observed integrated production finally the percentage was passed as argument to a sigmoid function f a 1 1 e k x x 0 which returned in output a value that we used as learning rate value for the considered pattern the momentum parameter value was selected by subtracting the learning rate to 1 momentum 1 learning rate it should be noted that the larger the percentage the higher the resulting learning rate value as a result we enhanced the importance of the patterns which were more distant from the desired output in updating the weights during the learning procedure in fact a high value of learning rate boosts the influence of the current pattern on the weights update while the momentum enhances the importance of the previous update we found that in this case 10 was the optimal number of hidden nodes several similar solutions could be developed and tested to apply such customization to the training procedures we applied the solution that in our opinion best fitted both our dataset and our goals 2 6 model performances assessment once all the different ecologically sound anns were trained we assessed their performances relative to the test set from both a depth resolved and a depth integrated production perspective we used the mse and the determination coefficient r2 as accuracy measures moreover we analyzed the differences between the models trained with the customized algorithms and their conventional depth resolved counterpart mattei et al 2018 table 2 thus highlighting the effects of a training procedure driven by ecological knowledge finally we took into account the distribution of the differences between predicted and observed phytoplankton primary production to highlight whether the estimates were affected by a systematic bias or not the anns performances evaluation was carried out on raw values i e mg c m 3 day 1 and mg c m 2 day 1 for the depth resolved and the depth integrated estimates respectively this allowed us to analyze both the error and the accuracy of the estimates on the actual scale used in studies on phytoplankton primary production e g conti and scardi 2010 in this way we conveyed in a more straightforward way the quality of our appraisals with respect to indexes computed on log transformed values finally we tested whether or not the performance differences in terms of overall determination coefficient between the customized solutions and the classic ebp were statistically significant through a wilcoxon test wilcoxon 1945 the test was performed on 100 random data subsamples each of which contained 66 of the original data these subsamples were used to train and test one ann for each solution i e the classic ebp the single peak constraint the depth weighted error and the variable learning rate and momentum 3 results and discussion our main goal was to develop an empirical model for the estimation of the phytoplankton primary production based on a ml technique and to show how the algorithms that supported such approaches could be customized in order to obtain better estimates among the various techniques we chose an ann since this approach already showed good results in modeling the marine phytoplankton primary production scardi 2001 moreover anns are robust with respect to potential noise affecting data which is always to be expected when phytoplankton production data are taken into account given that the in situ measurement of this information is a challenging process scardi 2001 1996 scardi and harding 1999 furthermore the ann approach grants an output which is continuous over the data space the latter feature is crucial for regression models aimed at estimating processes like the primary production on the other hand the ebp algorithm customization has been carried out through several customization applied to the training phase the performances of the tailored procedures from both a depth resolved and a depth integrated perspective were analyzed and compared among them and with the conventional version of the model i e trained with the standard ebp algorithm the performance assessment for each solution presented in this work was carried on a data subset i e the test set which was never showed to the anns during the training procedure 3 1 anns performances 3 1 1 single peak constraint filter the first customization that we applied penalizes the solutions which from a depth resolved perspective showed more than one peak in the vertical distribution of the phytoplankton primary production fig 3 a shows the observed vs estimated profile values in which data from all the fixed depths from 0 m to 60 m are represented the cloud of points follows the concordance diagonal and the values are almost symmetrically scattered around it the overall r2 associated with this solution was equal to 0 682 and the mse was equal to 1051 23 while the scatterplot was a useful representation in order to show the concordance between observed and estimated values the histogram of the error distribution was aimed at analyzing whether a systematic bias in the estimates was present or not the overall error distribution was symmetrical and it showed neither the tendency to underestimate nor to overestimate primary production fig 3b indeed the mean error was less than the 1 of the primary production maximum value and the median error was nearly zero mean 3 97 mg c m 3 day 1 median 0 01 mg c m 3 day 1 furthermore in fig 3b the 5th 38 06 mg c m 3 day 1 and the 95th 18 81 mg c m 3 day 1 percentiles were highlighted in order to show the range in which the 95 of the differences fell the accuracy of the model expressed as r2 was not homogeneous along the water column and this feature was shared by all the tested solutions as shown in table 3 for the single peak constraint the determination coefficients for the six fixed depths i e 0 m 5 m 10 m 20 m 40 m 60 m were respectively 0 652 0 671 0 508 0 136 0 283 0 421 although this difference in the explained variance when we analyzed the error distribution of each output no bias was detected in fact the range of the mean output values 0 28 9 06 mg c m 3 day 1 i e up to 0 82 of the maximum production value roughly 1101 89 mg c m 3 day 1 and all the median values were close to zero outputs median range 0 0 81 mg c m 3 day 1 table 3 the rationale behind this criterion was based on the assumption that profiles characterized by more than one production peak represented either a transient state of the water column or an error during the sampling procedures since we aimed at developing a model with a large degree of generality we decided that neither the former nor the latter scenarios that could have led to a multiple peak production profile were in accordance with our goal accordingly we increased the measured validation error associated with the estimated profiles which did not comply with our criterion see section 2 4 therefore the solutions which strongly violated the constraint exhibited a larger error with respect to those which were more compliant with it since the best solution after a training epoch was chosen on the basis of its accuracy on the validation set this procedure acted as a selection tool for the synaptic weights configuration that not only had a good numerical accuracy but also respected the constraint from a depth integrated production perspective the model explained roughly the 62 of the variance r2 0 628 and the mse value was equal to 257 203 90 the scatter plot in fig 4 a showed a good concordance but a slight tendency to overestimate low values and underestimate extremely high ones the distribution of the deviations fig 4b was symmetrical and while in this case the mean was strongly influenced by extreme values mean 77 20 mg c m 2 day 1 the median was more balanced median 17 92 mg c m 2 day 1 the 5th and 95th percentiles which contained the 90 of the differences were respectively 982 11 mg c m 2 day 1 and 475 35 mg c m 2 day 1 it is worth stressing that the single peak constraint did not directly affect the estimation of the depth integrated production nonetheless the higher ecological soundness of the depth resolved model which was conferred by the selection tool described in this paragraph in turn resulted in a higher level of accuracy from a depth integrated point of view with respect to the standard ebp version table 2 this feature clearly showed how the selection of the solution which resulted to be the most compliant with a theoretical sound shape of the vertical distribution of the phytoplankton production positively affected also the numerical accuracy of the depth integrated estimates 3 1 2 depth weighted error delta computation as for the previous algorithm customization the second criterion that we developed exploited the depth resolved nature of our approach in order to drive the ann training in fact we applied a depth weighted error according to which the three shallower depths i e 0 5 10 m were associated with an error multiplier higher than that for the following outputs i e 20 40 60 m thus enhancing the importance of the former with respect to the latter the error coefficients applied to the six fixed depths were respectively 2 1 5 1 3 1 0 8 0 7 these multipliers influenced the delta computation during the back propagation phase therefore this customization of the ebp algorithm directly affected the procedure that updated the ann weights the overall concordance between observed and estimated depth resolved phytoplankton production is showed in fig 5 a and it could be summarized by an r squared value of 0 679 and an mse equal to 1060 46 the cloud of data points fig 5a clearly followed the unit slope line graphically showing the good concordance expressed by the determination coefficient the error distribution is symmetrical and 90 of the deviations were comprised in a small range i e 35 97 17 80 mg c m 3 day 1 the mean error was smaller than 1 of the maximum production value and the median was equal to zero mean 3 62 mg c m 3 day 1 median 0 mg c m 3 day 1 the specific indexes for each fixed depth are listed in the table 4 the r2 ranged from 0 078 for the 20 m depth to 0 674 for the 10 m one even in this case the mean and the median of the error distribution showed an unbiased distribution mean range 7 05 0 19 mg c m 3 day 1 median range 0 30 0 01 mg c m 3 day 1 the development of this customization was driven by both theoretical and data derived ecological knowledge indeed we wanted to exploit the previous mentioned sources of information in order to influence the weight update during the training procedure it should be noted that the higher the depth associated with a specific ann output the lower the error multiplier this feature reflected our choice to indirectly enhance the importance of the shallower depths in determining the weights update by artificially boosting the error associated with them from an ecological perspective the depth weighted error followed the rationale that a higher share of phytoplankton primary production is associated with shallower depths this characteristic of the phytoplankton production is the result of the higher irradiance level which is a strong driver of primary production received by the upper zone of the water column moreover it is important to note that in coastal zones the upper layers of the water column are also richer in nutrients the latter feature could be caused by upwelling phenomena and or by external inputs of nutrients from the neighbouring terrestrial ecosystems on the other hand while analyzing our dataset we gathered further information that supported the decision to attribute more importance to the shallower depths with respect to the deeper ones during the ann training in fact we found that on average 50 of the primary production in each phytoplankton profile was confined within the first 10 m which corresponded to the first three outputs of our depth resolved model this customization not only allowed to embed theoretical knowledge in the ann learning phase but also enhanced the value of the dataset for the model training this procedure in turn translated a feature of our data in a customized criterion for the weights update as to the depth integrated production the depth weighted error procedure showed a good accuracy from estimated and observed integrated angle expressed as raw values r2 0 626 mse 259 006 60 fig 6 a the error distribution is roughly symmetrical although its mean seemed to be strongly affected by extreme values mean 84 04 mg c m 2 day 1 on the other hand the median value resulted to be very close zero median 2 99 mg c m 2 day 1 table 4 moreover 90 of the differences was comprised in the 890 75 471 58 range fig 6b it ought to be noted that even in this case the appraisal of the production from an integrated perspective was not directly affected by the customization nevertheless the enhanced importance attributed to the shallower depths in determining the weights update led to an increased accuracy with respect to the conventional version of the model the reason behind this improved accuracy in term of both r squared and mse could be justified by the higher magnitude of production that was associated with the upper zone of the water column in fact the latter zone clearly had a great impact on the depth integrated production estimate 3 1 3 variable learning rate and momentum lr m the third customization that we tested to drive the weights update aimed at exploiting the information provided by the observed integrated production obtained from the training patterns the customization applied using this criterion acted on the setting of two learning parameter that in anns jargon are known as learning rate and momentum accordingly before the back propagation phase in the ebp algorithm we computed the estimated production profile for the current pattern and compared it to the integrated production profile obtained from our data set the absolute value of the difference between these two values was then converted to a percentage of the in situ measured production the same value was passed as the argument to a sigmoid function which returned a value to be used as the learning rate for the current weights update on the other hand the momentum value was set as 1 learning rate this solution was the one that allowed explaining the larger share of variance with a determination coefficient equal to 0 696 i e roughly 70 explained variance and showed the lower mse mse 1003 75 the good fitting between observed and estimated depth resolved production values was highlighted by the points distribution fig 7 a which clearly follow the concordance diagonal and was nearly symmetrical around it as to the error distribution analysis fig 7b the deviation histogram was symmetrical and showed the lower mean value among the various tested solutions mean 2 63 mg c m 3 day 1 and a median equal to zero furthermore the 5th and the 95th percentile values 34 25 mg c m 3 day 1 and 22 34 mg c m 3 day 1 respectively showed that the 90 of the differences were comprised in a narrow range we have already stated that all the solutions did not show a homogeneous accuracy along the water column from the r squared perspective table 5 in fact the explained variance ranged from 67 7 for the 0 m output to 11 3 for the 20 m output on the other hand while analysing the mean and median values of the error distribution for each output we found that the difference in the accuracy was not as strong as the determination coefficient suggested table 5 indeed the mean error range was 4 85 0 27 mg c m 3 day 1 while the median one was 0 55 0 90 mg c m 3 day 1 it is worth noting that we developed this training criterion in order to exploit a paramount information present in our dataset that otherwise would not be included in the learning procedure indeed in both the conventional and customized versions of our depth resolved model the information provided by the depth integrated production did not contribute to the model development since we showed that the estimation accuracy of the integrated primary production with an ann approach could be indirectly boosted through a depth resolved approach mattei et al 2018 we tried to fully exploit the information in our data set to further improve the quality of the estimates also from a depth integrated perspective accordingly we customized the ebp algorithm aiming at enhancing the importance when updating the weights of the most challenging patterns in fact the training for patterns that showed a high difference between the estimated and expected depth integrated production were driven by high learning rate and a low momentum conversely examples showing a high concordance with the observed integrated production affected to a lesser extent the weights update i e were associated to low learning rate and high momentum in contrast with the previous two customizations the one presented in this section directly affected the estimation of the depth integrated primary production in fact the value of the expected production along the water column was exploited in the training phase therefore it is not surprising that this solution provided more accurate appraisals and explained a larger share of the variance in the estimation of the vertically integrated primary production with respect to the other models we developed r2 0 642 mse 248 060 80 fig 8 a the error distribution was symmetrical fig 8b and showed the best values for both the mean and the median which was nearly zero mean 51 91 mg c m 2 day 1 median 0 33 mg c m 2 day 1 table 5 furthermore the 5th and the 95th percentiles were computed and 90 of the differences fell in the range 891 19 537 01 mg c m 2 day 1 3 2 conventional and ecologically sound anns comparison as showed by the results presented in the previous sections all the ecologically sound versions of the model outperformed the conventional one the single peak constraint showed an overall increase in the accuracy of the estimates in term of explained variance and mse compared to the standard ebp version of the model table 2 vs table 3 this was the less invasive procedure applied to the ebp algorithm in fact it did not directly drive the weights update rather it selected among the various solutions the most strictly compliant with the chosen theoretical criterion i e the penalization of multiple peaks in vertical profiles indeed this constraint helped to reduce the space of the possible solutions limiting the potential variability of the production vertical distributions to the most ecologically sound ones this constraint by penalizing the solutions that are linked with errors or transient states of the water column could be effective in order to achieve a high degree of generality it is reasonable to assume that the reason for the augmented accuracy from both a depth integrated and a depth resolved perspective table 2 vs table 3 was the result of the good generality achieved thank to this solution as to the depth weighted error procedure it also showed an increase in the accuracy with respect to the classic ebp training table 2 vs table 4 this customization acted on a delicate phase of the ebp algorithm i e the delta computation accordingly it is possible that further tests could lead to a better exploitation of this type of customization the last customization showed the highest gain in accuracy from both a depth resolved and a depth integrated point of view outperforming all other presented approaches table 5 given the empirical nature of our model this result did not surprise us in fact in this ebp customization we found an unconventional way to convoy a larger share of information from our data set into the model training indeed the magnitude of the phytoplankton production in the whole water column was not exploited in other approaches and we thought that it could have improved the accuracy of our ann model furthermore through the variable learning rate and momentum we stressed the importance in updating the weights of those patterns whose estimated values were more distant from an optimal solution thus focussing the learning efforts on the most challenging examples furthermore achieving high quality estimates from a depth integrated perspective is paramount not only for the understanding of the primary production dynamics but also for related studies which exploit such estimates for several purposes conti and scardi 2010 franzese et al 2017 reuer et al 2007 russo et al 2019 as stated in section 3 1 the performances expressed as r2 decreased along the water column exception made for the last two outputs on the other hand when other statistics were taken into account the differences were substantially lower tables 2 to 5 this feature could depend on the high degree of variability associated with a specific depth such as the 20 m output which ranges from 0 to 281 58 mg c m 3 day 1 moreover the deeper layers of the water column are usually associated with lower production values which exert a lower influence on the weight update during the training procedure furthermore the link between the predictive variables and the model outputs weakened with depth since we used only surface predictors conversely the apparent inversion of this tendency for the last two standard depths could only be justified by their low variability in fact as stated in section 2 2 over the 75 of the production profiles showed null production associated with this area of the water column regardless this characteristic it should be stressed that the higher share of phytoplankton production was associated with the shallower depths accordingly a higher accuracy in the latter zone of the water column was paramount in the estimation of the phytoplankton primary production as stated in section 2 6 we tested the statistical significance of the performance difference in terms of overall r2 between the classic and the customized algorithms through the wilcoxon test we found that the accuracy of the depth weighted error and the variable learning rate customizations was significantly higher than the classic ebp version p values 2 06 10 11 and 5 42 10 10 respectively on the other hand the single peak constraint accuracy was not significantly different with respect to the conventional model nevertheless we think that the single peak procedure enhanced the ecological quality of the estimates reducing the less ecologically consistent profiles even if the numerical accuracy was not significantly improved this customization is the less invasive one it only filtered the solutions once the weights update were performed and it can be used in combination with the other customizations which directly affect the weights update it ought to be noted that even when the accuracy raise was moderate from a numerical perspective the ecological quality of the estimates should be taken into account in fact we aimed not only at enhancing the accuracy of the estimates but also at achieving better performances through a boosted ecological consistency of the primary production appraisals moreover the conventional version of the model already proved to be a good solution from a numerical accuracy perspective therefore even a moderate improvement in the accuracy coupled with an enhancement of the biological soundness of the model could be regarded as an important result from a more general viewpoint we wanted to highlight how ml algorithms should be treated as tools in the hands of a modeler we tested three different approaches to customize a classic ebp algorithm for a specific task i e phytoplankton primary production our goal was to show how theoretical and data derived knowledge could be embedded in a training procedure in order to enhance the quality of a model output furthermore we believe that the rationale behind our work i e customizing a learning phase through theoretical knowledge could be effective not only in a primary production modelling framework but also in a broader one in fact our results suggest that a customized approach to ann model development could lead to an improvement in the quality of estimates from both a theoretical and a numerical point of view 4 conclusions this paper aims at highlighting how anns as well as other ml algorithms could be tailored to better fit the modeler needs achieving better results not only from a numerical point of view but also from an application specific perspective we presented three different approaches aimed at enhancing the ecological soundness of ann models through the customization of the classic ebp algorithm to achieve such an objective we defined three different customizations that once applied to the training procedure allowed us to embed theoretical and data derived ecological knowledge in our models from a numerical perspective the accuracy improvement with respect to the classic ebp version of the model mattei et al 2018 was not large since the paramount requirement for empirical models is the amount and the quality of the available data this is especially true when a process which is highly variable on spatial and temporal scale such as the phytoplankton primary production is taken into account nevertheless all the anns trained with an ecologically sound strategy performed better than their conventional counterpart thus showing that our approach improved the quality of the phytoplankton primary production estimates furthermore the higher quality of the estimates achieved thanks to the customizations we presented could in turn positively affect the results of the studies which are related to the primary production appraisals we suggest that the rationale proposed in this paper could be repurposed in similar modeling applications and that it is likely to lead to improved model performances it is important to stress how ml algorithms are widely open to such type of customizations and we believe that this should be the way forward for the application of these powerful tools in highly specific tasks declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

24888,pest control is still a major issue for the agricultural sector conservation biological control which controls pests using their natural enemies ne appears to be a promising strategy considering the negative impacts of pesticides on the environment and human health conservation biological control relies on two main processes the conservation of a large abundance of ne and their biological control function per se to implement conservation biological control it was suggested to increase the proportion of semi natural habitats snh at the landscape scale because they contain important resources for ne especially for survival during overwintering however empirical studies show mixed results and the mechanisms involved are not well understood here we focus on the temporality of the biological control process as a key driver of the efficiency of pest regulation and the resulting limitation of crop yield losses using a modelling approach we analyse the interplay between the landscape structure and the spatio temporal dynamics of the interactions between crops pests and ne in a virtual agricultural landscape comprising crops and snh to characterise the pest control service we use several indicators including crop yield response defined as a function of the temporal outcomes of the species interactions we also test two ecological traits that are assumed to be important pest colonisation rate and ne dispersal behaviour we observe a positive response of the ne visitation rate of colonised crops when increasing the snh proportion however optimising the pest control service at the crop cell scale requires much more snh than maximising the visitation rate due to the influence of temporal trophic interactions indeed increasing the snh proportion makes it possible for ne to arrive at the crop cells faster after the pest colonisation which reduces the average crop losses however there is a trade off in optimising the crop yield at the cell or landscape scale because of the conversion of the productive crop area into snh overall our results suggest that modifying the snh proportion in agricultural landscapes can enhance the delivery of the pest control service provided that the landscape design allows ne to arrive at the right place at the right time in the event of pest colonisation abbreviations cbc conservation biological control ne natural enemies snh semi natural habitats keywords conservation biological control semi natural habitats timing spatially explicit and individual based model pest control crop yield 1 introduction for decades pest control has been and continues to be a major issue for the agricultural sector oerke 2006 culliney 2014 sharma et al 2017 there is an increasing need to develop alternative solutions to the use of pesticides because of their negative impacts on the environment and human health bourguet and guillemaud 2016 gaba et al 2018 some pest control strategies have been developed to benefit from biological control which is the biodiversity ecosystem function of the trophic regulation of pest populations by keystone biological agents notably arthropods costanza et al 1997 pest control using biological control is thus an important ecosystem service delivered by biodiversity and it has been shown for instance that the economic value of the pest control service attributable to insects represents us 4 5 billion annually when considering eight majors crops in the usa alone losey and vaughan 2006 conservation biological control cbc is one of the pest control strategies that benefits from the biological control of insects cbc aims to favour the presence of natural enemies ne i e native insect predators and parasitoids already present in agro ecosystems as opposed to introduced enemies landis et al 2000 it is a promising strategy because it avoids the potential negative impacts to the environment or human health relating to chemicals or introduced biological agents rusch et al 2016a van lenteren et al 2006 the conceptual framework of cbc relies on two main processes firstly the conservation of a large population of ne in the agroecosytem and secondly their biological control function per se which results in the pest suppression by ne and the limitation of pest damage on crops begg et al 2016 during this biological control process the temporal aspects of the trophic interactions between crops pests and ne can modify the relationship between pest regulation and crop yield outcomes firstly the date of the pest colonisation of crops can impact the magnitude of crop damage according to the crop phenology earlier pest colonisation relative to the age of the crop often induces more yield losses amoako atta and omolo 1983 robert 2004 bancal et al 2007 but a compensation phenomenon from the plant may also reduce the crop damage pinet et al 2015 secondly the timing of the arrival of ne at colonised crops is also a key driver of the efficiency of pest suppression and the limitation of crop yield losses costamagna et al 2015 neuville et al 2016 indeed as the pest population growth rate is generally higher than the pest removal rate by ne the latter should arrive rapidly after the pest colonisation event to regulate the pest dynamics thus the crop sowing dates and the timing of both pest colonisation and ne arrival are key factors influencing the pest regulation and the limitation of crop losses and this temporal sequence of events consequently plays an important role in the efficiency of the cbc strategy and the delivery of the pest control service the implementation of a cbc strategy to enhance pest control services can be achieved through habitat management by modifying for example the proportion of semi natural habitats snh at the landscape scale tscharntke et al 2007 holland et al 2016 indeed many arthropods involved in pest control disperse between habitats and across crop non crop interfaces in order to complete their lifecycle at spatial scales beyond the plot and farm levels rand et al 2006 schellhorn et al 2014 snh e g woodlots hedgerows floral or grass strips supply overwintering habitats alternative food resources and shelters for a wide variety of ne and they can also play the role of reservoirs for ne during pest outbreaks in the surrounding crops landis et al 2000 tscharntke et al 2007 increasing the snh proportion in the agricultural landscape should therefore result in larger ne populations and lower distances between ne sources and crops thus enhancing the visitation of colonised crops by ne several reviews and meta analyses have supported the significant positive effect of the snh proportion in the landscape on the abundance of ne but these studies also show a substantial variation in the response of the pest control service e g bianchi et al 2006 chaplin kramer et al 2011 veres et al 2013 rusch et al 2016a in particular an increase in ne abundance does not necessarily result in higher pest control or yield chaplin kramer et al 2011 in a recent analysis karp et al 2018 corroborated this variability across studies and across variables used to characterise the pest control service e g ne abundance ne predation activity pest abundance crop damage crop yield in response to the snh proportion thus while modifying the snh proportion appears to be a promising cbc to enhance the pest control services there are still important gaps in our understanding of the mechanisms relating to the landscape structure and effective limitation of crop losses through cbc here we seek to test how the temporal dynamics of the trophic interactions between crops pests and ne can affect the relationship between the landscape proportion of snh and the pest control response we also consider the influence of two functional ecological traits of importance in this context namely the pest colonisation rate of the cropping landscape and the dispersal behaviour of ne for this purpose we developed a model that simulates the dynamics of a meta population of ne and its impacts on the regulation of crop yield losses due to crop pests in an agricultural landscape comprised of both crops and snh to take into account the landscape scale processes such as the dispersal of ne and pest dynamics as well as the local scale processes such as trophic interactions between crops pests and ne in crop fields and their consequences on crop yields our model is spatially explicit and simulates the behaviour of ne populations located on crop fields that interact with their environment to evaluate the pest control service we compute four distinct indicators i the proportion of colonised crops visited by the ne ii the mean delay between pest colonisation and ne arrival events in crops iii the average crop losses per crop area unit and iv the total crop yield at the landscape scale we compare the responses of these indicators to the variation of the snh proportion and the functional traits of the pest colonisation rate and ne dispersal behaviour 2 material and methods we describe the model using the odd overview design concept and details protocol grimm et al 2006 2010 section 2 1 provides an overview of the model section 2 2 explains the design concepts section 2 3 depicts the initialisation section 2 4 describes the sub models procedures and finally section 2 5 explains the scenarios implemented for the simulation experiments all the parameters are defined in table 1 although our model deals with the conceptualisation of a cbc strategy in an agricultural landscape we also adapt it to the case of aphid pest control in annual crops i e winter wheat by flying generalist predators i e ladybirds this biological model is a classic of conservation biological control because the scenario in which a dominant crop pest in an annual cropping system is regulated by a generalist predator is common in temperate agricultural areas and has been largely covered in field studies dealing with habitat heterogeneity and pest control e g gardiner et al 2009 caballero lópez et al 2012 megan woltz and landis 2014 referring to such biological model helped us to design processes calibrate parameters and discuss the results in relation to the relevant literature cereal aphids are specialist herbivores dixon 1998 and major insect pests in cereal crops in northern europe dedryver et al 2010 each spring aphids disperse from their overwintering locations and colonise cereal fields during the stem elongating stage according to the species the life stage and the morph winged aphids are able to move trough different modes of transport and on a continuum of spatial and temporal scales van emden et harrington 2017 migrations on large distances sometimes on several dozens of kilometers thanks to passive wind transportation and active flights are unfrequent events and generally concern newly emerged alate aphids while the most majority of flight events during the lifetime of aphids are on short distance of the order of 20 m in favourable habitat and 100 m in poor habitat parry 2013 ladybirds are common and generalist agricultural predators although many species restrict their diets to one or few aphid species dixon and dixon 2000 hodek et al 2012 they are holometabolous and pass through the following stages egg larva the longer stage of the preimaginal development pupa and adults in temperate regions ladybirds have often only one generation per year the juvenile stage lasts around three weeks while adults typically live around one year hodek et al 2012 adults overwinter in non crop vegetation around crop fields and fly to colonise crops early in the growing season when prey densities begin to increase hodek et al 2012 adults are highly dynamic across the landscapes with substantial daily migration between fields in order to localise food such as plants colonised by aphids evans et richards 1997 van der werf et al 2000 individual ladybirds are not gregarious but they are strongly attracted by preys and as aphids are often clustered in agricultural areas ladybirds also aggregate on crop areas with pests volatile cues are supposed to attract ladybirds at short distance but detection of suitable patches on larger scales is still intriguing and volatiles as visual cues could be involved lorenzetti et al 1997 hodek et al 2012 adults stop when preys are sufficiently abundant in order to limit the important cannibalism of their larvae the number of laid eggs is proportional to the density of aphids until a certain threshold which modulates the final capacity of pest regulation hodek et al 2012 adults generally fly away after laying eggs in order to limit competition larvae are able to eat a large number of aphids and they greatly contribute to the regulation of the aphid density and impact contrary to adults their mobility is very limited because they are not winged and as a consequence they generally stay on the crop plant they were born or only move to the immediately neighbooring plants 2 1 overview 2 1 1 purpose the purpose of this model is to simulate the influence of the temporal dynamics of trophic interactions between crops pests and ne on the response to pest control services while considering variations in the snh proportion in the landscape we also consider how two ecological traits namely pest colonisation rate and ne dispersal behaviour can affect this relationship 2 1 2 state variables and scales the agricultural landscape is represented by a spatial grid and discretised in 33 33 square cells each cell of the grid is characterised by its landcover and can be either a snh i e a non cultivated and non intensively managed element with woody herbaceous or natural vegetation or a crop field i e a plot of annual crops such as winter wheat we scale the cells to a size of approximately 1 ha each resulting in a square spatial domain of around 3 3 km such cell scale corresponds more or less to one field plot which is the management scale for landcover in agricultural landscapes furthermore it is also compatible with dispersal processes of ladybirds which are able to move from field to field at a daily rate hodek et al 2012 evans et richards 1997 van der werf et al 2000 a simulated agricultural landscape grid is characterised by a fixed proportion p of snh cells with a certain level of aggregation g in real landscapes the total number of insects pests or ne present in such a cell area can be very great for simplicity of modelling and computations we do not model pest and ne individuals but rather populations of insects covering one whole cell thus one cell is always considered as free occupied by pests by ne or simultaneously by pests and ne as in a meta population model we assume that pest dynamics is implicit and deterministic modelled as a pest colonisation rate of the crop cells at the landscape scale each day a certain proportion of crop cells free of pests are thus colonised according to a random spatial pattern this random colonisation can be considered as the initial migratory flight on large distance of newly emerged aphids through passive transportation and randomly landing on suitable crop cells we assume that every colonised crop cell is covered by the same initial number of pest individuals as aphids generally move on short distances after landing from their large initial flight we also assume that pests cover the whole area of the colonised crop cell but are not able to colonise other crop cells in the agricultural landscape including the neighbouring ones we therefore assume that the pest colonisation process is independent of the pest dynamics within the agricultural landscape contrary to pests we explicitly model ne populations which allows us to investigate the interaction between the landscape features and the influence of ne dispersal behaviour we assume that ne populations are large groups of individual ne covering one cell all the ne populations have the same size and all the individuals of one ne population share the same characteristics they have the same age are on the same stage die at the same time and have the same behaviour in particular the same dispersal behaviour we assume that ne populations can be either adult all the individuals are adult or juveniles all the individuals are juvenile as for ladybirds adult ne are able to fly and they can move on long distances from field to field on the contrary juvenile ne stay on the cell they were born until converting into adults because they are not able to fly we also assume that all the individuals of one juvenile ne population convert to adults at the same time and as a consequence when one juvenile ne population has grown enough it is converted to one adult ne population we assume that at the beginning of one season a certain number of adult ne populations are located into snh cells as crops are colonised by pests during this period adult ne populations are moving from cell to cell in order to find colonised crops we therefore assume that all the individuals of one adult ne population move on the same direction if ladybirds are not gregarious they use a diversity of clues to find preys for instance olfactory and visual one and they are strongly attracted by such clues aggregating on locations with preys as a consequence we assume that such individual dispersal behaviour when considering a large number of insects located on the same field can be modelled by the dispersal of a whole population at the field spatial grain once one adult ne population has found a crop cell colonised by pests the ne population stops feeds and reproduces giving birth to a new juvenile ne population only one new juvenile population is produced during each reproduction event but one adult ne population can reproduce as many times as it finds a new colonised crop cell after this reproduction event the adult ne population moves from the crop cell while the juvenile ne population stays on the crop cell feeding on pest preys until converting into a new adult ne population able to fly we also assume that when one adult ne population or one juvenile ne population stays on one crop cell other adult ne populations can not stop on the same crop cell indeed ladybirds avoid competition for preys and limit the residence time or the number of laid eggs when their densities juveniles and adults are too high during dispersal adult ne populations suffer a mortality rate due for instance to environmental factors or the lack of energy and when a mortality event occurs we assume that all the individual of the population die at the same time resulting in the suppression of the whole ne population at the end of the season adult ne populations search for overwintering habitats and try to move in snh because juvenile and adult ne populations will not survive to the winter in crops like for crop cells we assume that one adult ne population located on one crop cell covers the whole cell snh cells sharing at least one edge form a snh cluster and we assume that one cluster has a limited carrying capacity i e only a limited number of adult ne populations located on this cluster will be able to survive after the overwintering period this carrying capacity depends on the cluster size the number of snh cells and of the carrying capacity of each crop cell called k for instance in our simulations k 0 5 and each adult ne population requires two snh cells of the cluster to overwinter this means that adult ne populations will not be able to survive in isolated crop cells and that the maximal number of adult ne populations that one snh cluster can shelter during the overwintering period corresponds to the half of its own number of snh cells finally we also assume that one adult ne population lives one year because ladybirds have also only one generation per year in temperate areas as a consequence we assume that if one adult ne population was born during the year y it will die before the end of the year y 1 furthermore in order to depict the species interactions between crop plants pests and ne in crop cells during the year each crop cell is characterised by a state variable called s this variable can take six states fig 1 i pest free i e not yet colonised by pests ii non detectable i e pests have only just colonised this crop cell but the pest population size is still limited so pests are not yet detectable by adult ne populations iii detectable i e the pest population in the crop cell has grown enough to make detection possible by adult ne populations but there is not yet ne settled on the cell iv occupied by adult ne i e an adult ne population has found the pests and stopped in the crop cell in order to feed on them and reproduce other adult ne population can not stop to feed nor reproduce on the cell v occupied by juvenile ne i e after reproducing and giving birth to a new juvenile ne population the adult ne population flies away whereas juveniles remain in the crop cell and feed on the pests until converting into adults as for the previous state other adult ne population can not stop to feed nor reproduce on the cell vi regulated i e once the juvenile ne population becomes an adult ne population this population flies away and the pest population on the cell is considered as controlled this crop cell cannot be colonised again by pests before the end of the year or being attractive for other adult ne populations indeed we assume that once one crop cell is colonised the pest population on this cell is growing exponentially in absence of regulation the sooner this colonisation event occurs the more the pest population will grow and induce an important impact on crop yield when one adult ne population stops and reproduces on one colonised crop cell we assume that the regulation capacity of ne or the proportion of pests they control and the impact of pests on crop yield will depend on the delay between the pest colonisation and the arrival of ne if ne arrive just after the pest colonisation they will be able to suppress entirely the pest population and the impact on crop yield will be minimal on the contrary if they arrive later they will only partially control pests and the impact on crop yield will be higher however even if the whole pest population was not suppressed we assume that the remaining pests after ne location do not influence the colonisation of other crop cells in the landscape nor the colonisation during the following year furthermore in order to compute the crop yield losses resulting from these trophic interactions between crops pests and ne we have characterised each crop cell by two variables that collect the dates for the events of pest colonisation d1 and the arrival of ne d2 on this crop cell because we assume that these timings are the drivers of the outcomes of the predator prey dynamics see section 2 2 observations for details 2 1 3 process overview and scheduling each year is divided into three successive periods i the pest colonisation period ii the take shelter period and iii the overwintering period while the model proceeds at daily time steps during the two first periods which continue for d1 time steps for pest colonisation 150 days in our simulations and d2 time steps for take shelter 30 days in our simulations the overwintering period is computed in a single time step for each model time step a certain sequence of events occurs and the nature of these events depends on the period once the three periods are completed a new year begins this time scheduling and the corresponding sequences of events are shown in fig 2 at the beginning of the pest colonisation period adult ne populations are located in the snh where they are overwintering as soon as the pest colonisation period begins pests colonise crops with a speed according to the pest colonisation rate procedure pestcolonisation section 2 4 2 adult ne populations then leave the snh and disperse within the landscape grid procedure dispersing section 2 4 5 whenever they move to a crop they can experience mortality procedure mortality section 2 4 4 adult ne populations can not stop nor feed on crop cells already occupied by other ne adults or juveniles once one adult ne population has found a crop colonised by pests but free of other ne adults or juveniles the ne population stops to feed and reproduces there after l2 days 7 days in our simulations matching with the time for ladybirds to lay eggs after they mate the adult ne population gives birth to one single population of juveniles procedure updatecropstate section 2 4 3 and flies away procedure dispersing section 2 4 5 the juvenile population remains on the crop where it was born for l3 days 21 days in our simulations matching with the time for ladybird larvae to complete the whole juvenile stage feeding on pests until converting into an adult ne population procedure updatecropstate section 2 4 3 and then flying away to find other colonised crops procedure dispersing section 2 4 5 the number of reproduction events for one adult ne population is not limited and while the pest colonisation period has not ended the adult ne populations can give birth to new ne if they find detectable crops as described above these interactions between ne and pests on crops are included in the states of crop cells the transitions between these states and the timings of pest and ne arrivals procedure updatecropstate section 2 4 3 after d1 days 150 in our simulations the pest colonisation period ends and the take shelter period begins during this period adult ne populations no longer stop at crops even if they are colonised by pests instead adult ne populations move towards the snh procedure backtosnh section 2 4 6 they are still experiencing mortality during this movement procedure mortality section 2 4 4 if juveniles convert into adults during this period procedure updatecropstate section 2 4 3 they adopt the adult behaviour after d2 days 30 in our simulations the take shelter period ends and the overwintering period starts adult and juvenile ne populations die if they are still located in crops when this period starts on the contrary one adult ne population in the snh can survive or die according to the carrying capacity of the snh cluster where ne have found a shelter procedure overwintering section 2 4 7 2 2 design concepts 2 2 1 basic principles ne are mobile agents and during the season adult ne populations move from snh to crops in order to find pests and reproduce and then they come back to snh for overwintering the pest dynamics are deterministic and modelled as a pest colonisation rate at the landscape scale the interplay between the landscape structure proportion and arrangement of snh its spatio temporal dynamics pest colonisation of the crops and the dispersal behaviour of adult ne populations results in local species interactions between crops pests and ne species interactions involve a temporal sequence of events firstly the pest colonisation followed by the arrival of adult ne populations in each crop cell the final yield losses depend on the timing of these events 2 2 2 emergence the main emergent properties are the movement and dynamics of the meta population of adult ne populations as well as the delivery of the pest control service 2 2 3 interactions we considered trophic interactions between crops pests and ne we also considered competition between ne as one adult ne population cannot stop and reproduce in crop cells already occupied by other adult or juvenile ne population adult ne populations also compete for snh during overwintering and every cluster of snh cells has its own limited carrying capacity that determines the final number of adult ne populations surviving the winter period in the cluster each snh cluster can shelter a maximum number of adult ne populations equal to number of cells in the cluster k where k is the carrying capacity of one snh cell with k 0 5 in our simulations 2 2 4 stochasticity for each simulation we generated a new virtual landscape characterised by the indicators of snh proportion p between 0 and 95 of snh cells and aggregation g g 9 corresponding to the strong aggregation of snh cells according to the given simulation scenario we chose in our scenarios to focus on landscapes with a strong aggregation of snh g 9 and only the snh proportion was varying in order to deal with the stochasticity we repeated each scenario a combination between the values for snh proportion pest colonisation rate and dispersal behaviour 150 times see section 2 5 during the initialisation step the allocation of adult ne populations initial number n 25 in snh cells is randomly chosen furthermore the spatial assignation of pest colonised crops during the pest colonisation period is also randomised among the crops that are not yet colonised the mortality of adult ne populations associated with their movement in crops is modelled using a bernoulli trial m 0 1 during overwintering adult ne populations that die are randomly chosen when the carrying capacity of the snh cell cluster is exceeded k 0 5 2 2 5 observation we simulated the abundance of ne populations adult and juvenile populations over time as well as the abundance of crops with the different states s pest free non detectable detectable occupied by adult ne populations occupied by juvenile ne populations regulated to evaluate the pest control service delivery during a year we used four distinct indicators i the visitation rate which is the fraction of crop cells colonised by pests that are also visited by ne ii the mean time elapsed between the pest colonisation date and the arrival date of one adult ne population in each crop cell iii the average crop losses in crop cells due to the crop pest ne interactions and iv the total crop production at the landscape scale to compute the final crop yield y of a given crop cell at the end of the year we considered the difference between a theoretical and maximal crop yield in the absence of pests and the actual crop loss value due to pests ψ 1 y 100 ψ the actual crop losses ψ of a given crop cell is the difference between the theoretical crop loss due to pests in the absence of regulation ψth and the reduction of crop losses due to the regulation by ne δψ ψth where δψ is the reduction coefficient of crop losses 2 ψ ψ t h 1 δ ψ the theoretical crop losses ψth of a crop cell colonised by pests depicts the response of yield to the crop pest interactions in absence of regulation by ne this value is a decreasing function of the date of arrival of pests d1 at the crops fig sa1 appendix a 3 ψ t h d 1 m 1 e q 1 d 1 1 where m1 is the maximal theoretical crop losses and q1 a time reduction coefficient if pests have not colonised the crop cell then ψth 0 the function decreases with time meaning that the later the pests colonise crops the less crop losses they will induce we thus assumed that the later the pests colonise the crops the less time they have to grow in terms of population size and the less damage they will inflict on the crop plant robert 2004 bancal et al 2007 the reduction of crop losses δψ ψth is the consequence of the regulation of the pest population growth by ne when they stop at a colonised crop δψ is the reduction coefficient of crop losses and this value is a function of the time d2 d1 elapsed between the pest colonisation and the arrival of one adult ne population fig sa2 appendix a 4 δ ψ d 2 d 1 1 100 m 2 1 e q 2 d 2 d 1 h 1 m 3 where m2 is the maximal capacity of crop loss reduction by the ne regulation h the time required for the crop losses to reduce to half of its maximum value m3 the minimal capacity and q2 the time reduction coefficient the later the adult ne population stops and reproduces at a crop cell after its colonisation by pests the less these ne are able to regulate the pests and reduce the crop losses this mechanism has been shown in manipulative studies where an early colonisation of crop fields by ne during the pest colonisation period was related to a better pest suppression indeed early colonisation by ne slows pest population growth before it reaches an exponentially increasing trajectory ives and settle 1997 hopper et al 1995 finally the total crop production at the landscape scale can be computed at the end of the year by summing the yield of each crop cell snh cells do not supply any yield 2 3 initialisation for each simulation a landscape grid is initialised initlandscape section 2 4 1 and an initial number of adult ne populations initial number n 25 are randomly located in the snh after this initialisation the model can simulate several years nyears with here nyears 20 years of data 2 4 submodels 2 4 1 procedure initlandscape this procedure generates a virtual landscape with an assigned proportion of snh p 0 95 from 5 to 5 and their level of aggregation g we focused only on landscapes with strong aggregation of the snh cells i e g 9 this aggregation parameter is related to the average number of snh cells neighbouring each snh cell moore neighbourhood the lower values of g indicate a landscape with scattered snh while higher values of g indicate a landscape with very clustered snh the procedure first creates a two dimensional landscape grid with the proportions p of snh cells and 1 p crop cells according to a totally random spatial pattern at each iteration of the algorithm the parameter g is calculated if the calculated g is lower than its target value it means that the snh cells should be more aggregated and a snh cell with lower number of snh neighbours is switched to a crop cell and a crop cell close to a snh cell with higher snh neighbours is switched to crop the opposite if g is higher than its target value iterations stop when the calculated g and its target value are sufficiently close their difference is lower than a precision threshold put equal to 0 1 in our simulations since not all the values of g are possible for given p it is possible that the algorithm does not converge therefore another condition for stopping the algorithm is if 1500 iterations are reached which is generally more then sufficient in a 33 33 cells landscape once the grid is created this procedure also identifies the clusters of snh group of semi natural cells that share at least one edge cells other than snh are crops and they are characterised by the state s pest free finally adult ne populations are randomly allocated on snh initial number n 25 2 4 2 procedure pestcolonisation in this procedure a fixed proportion i of the crop cells is selected for every daily time step of the pest colonisation period to be colonised by pests fig 1 this parameter i is called the pest colonisation intensity and it drives two aspects of the pest dynamics which correspond to the total number of crop cells colonised throughout the year and the colonisation speed in our simulations i was varying between 1 and 8 i e between 1 and 8 of the total of crop cells are colonised by pests every daily time step until all the crop cells are colonised which are strong rates as all the crop cells have been colonised during a year furthermore we adopted a spatial random pattern for the pest colonisation and the crops that are converted from pest free to non detectable are randomly chosen from among the pest free crops for the sake of simplicity we do not consider the role of a pest spreading from cell to cell potentially due to the proximity and short distance active movements or the potential role of snh acting as sources of pests tscharntke et al 2016 considering the specific case of aphids this pattern can correspond to passive wind transportation over long distances from outside the landscape without the capacity to control the landing with precision this is sometimes called aphid rain parry 2013 2 4 3 procedure updatecropstate this procedure considers the transitions of a crop cell to the different states these transitions are driven by conditions based on the interactions between crops pests and ne as well as temporality see section 2 1 2 and fig 1 once a pest free crop has been selected to be colonised by pests procedure pestcolonisation the procedure updatecropstate converts the crop to the non detectable state we assume that the size of the initial pest population colonising a crop is very limited and consequently ne are not able to detect these pests the pest population can grow until it reaches a detectable size which occurs after l1 days 7 days in our simulation this temporal condition allows the crop to transition from the non detectable to the detectable state once one adult ne population has stopped at a detectable crop the procedure converts the cell to the state occupied by adult ne after l2 days 7 days in our simulations spent on the crop the adult ne population gives birth to one juvenile population and leaves the crop which induces the crop s transition to the state occupied by juvenile ne these juveniles feed on pests and grow on the crop during l3 days 21 days in our simulations and then convert to an adult ne population which leaves the cell the crop is then converted to the regulated state which forbids any new pest colonisation until the end of the year in addition to the transitions between crop states the procedure updatecropstate retains for any crop cell the dates d1 and d2 respectively corresponding to the pest colonisation of the crop cell and the arrival of the first adult ne population while the crop cell is in the state detectable 2 4 4 procedure mortality for every dispersal movement during the two successive periods of the pest colonisation or take shelter periods we define m as the mortality probability of adult ne populations due to external events or lack of energy as we assume that all the individuals of the same ne population face the same events on the same moment all these individuals die on the same time resulting in the suppression of the whole ne population mortality is modelled as a bernoulli trial 2 4 5 procedure dispersing this procedure rules the movements of adult ne populations during the first period of the pest colonisation period during this period and at every daily time step adult ne populations can orient themselves towards a directional cell and then move to the adjacent cell in the same direction as this directional cell according to the moore neighborhood i e a central cell and the eight cells which surround it on a two dimensional square lattice which allowed for diagonal movements adult ne populations move if they have not found a detectable crop where they can stop and reproduce or as soon as they have reproduced in order to find another detectable crop to orient themselves adult ne populations can evaluate the cells around their current location according to a distance radius r and they must pick one directional cell in this radius two distinct dispersal behaviours are then possible in the case of random dispersal ne randomly move to a directional cell in the radius in the case of oriented dispersal ne can detect detectable crops in the radius and identify the crop with the largest pest population i e the crop colonised for the longest time in order to choose it as the directional cell 2 4 6 procedure backtosnh this procedure determines the movements of adult ne populations during the second period of the year known as the take shelter period during this period adult ne populations try to find a snh to overwinter at every daily time step of this period we consider that adult ne populations detect the closest snh from their current location orient themselves towards it pick the neighbouring cell to their current location in the same direction as the closest snh cell and then move to it 2 4 7 procedure overwintering this procedure considers the mortality of ne during overwintering as there is one generation of ne per year adult ne populations that were born during the previous year die as ne can only overwinter in the snh not in crops the juvenile and adult ne populations that are still in crops during the transition between the take shelter and overwintering periods also die during the winter period the adult ne populations located in a snh overwinter the snh clusters have a limited carrying capacity in terms of resources which could limit the total number of ne surviving the winter period in a cluster then for every snh cluster the procedure computes the total number of adult ne populations that are located in the cluster and compares this number to the carrying capacity of the cluster which equals the total number of snh cells in the latter by the carrying capacity of snh cells called k with k 0 5 in our simulations if the number of adult ne populations is greater than the carrying capacity of the snh cluster the adult ne populations in excess are randomly chosen among the ones in the cluster and then die the surviving adult ne populations are then randomly dispatched on the snh cells in the cluster 2 5 scenarios for the simulation experiments we considered six scenarios according to a factorial design based on the distinct levels for the pest colonisation rate i 2 4 8 and the dispersal behaviour of adult ne populations random or oriented for each scenario we varied the snh proportion p between 0 and 95 at intervals of 5 in order to understand the influence of the snh proportion given the pest colonisation rate and the dispersal behaviour of adult ne populations we focused on landscapes with a strong aggregation of snh g 9 each combination pest colonisation rate x dispersal behaviour x snh proportion is repeated 150 times in order to cope with stochasticity parameters are set with the same values for every run see table 1 we stopped the simulations after nyears 20 years to be sure that the dynamics of the pest ne system enter a phase of permanent regime we obtained the outputs described in the observation part of the design concepts section taken from the end of the seventh year and that we used for figures we used netlogo 6 0 2 wilensky 1999 for running the scenarios and r 3 4 4 for the results 3 results figs 3 a and b show the proportion of crops colonised by pests and then visited by adult ne populations during the final year of the simulation known here as the visitation rate this visitation rate increases with the snh proportion and reaches 100 for both ne dispersal behaviours and all the pest colonisation rates however ne dispersal behaviour has an influence on the relationship between the snh proportion and visitation rate since ne are more efficient in visiting colonised crops when the dispersal is oriented rather than random furthermore the minimal snh proportions needed to reach 100 of visits are 25 and 50 for oriented and random dispersal respectively before reaching the plateau of 100 of visits for colonised crops the pest colonisation rate has a slight influence on the visitation rate for a given snh proportion thus the higher the pest colonisation rate the higher the visitation rate but this effect decreases when the pest colonisation rate increases the pest colonisation rate does not influence the value of the snh proportion that makes 100 of visits possible finally but only in the case of random dispersal the visitation rate decreases when the snh proportion becomes extreme 85 figs 3c and d show the average time delay between colonisation date and ne arrival for crops colonised by pests and visited by ne for any scenario of dispersal behaviour and pest colonisation rate this delay initially decreases when the snh proportion increases up to a minimum and then starts to increase for the highest snh values thus there is always a snh proportion value minimising this delay between pest colonisation and ne arrival it is important to note that these snh proportions are much higher than those making it possible to reach 100 of visits of colonised crops compare fig 3a and c or b and d furthermore adult ne populations with an oriented dispersal behaviour arrive at colonised crops much faster than those with a random dispersal on the contrary the influence of the pest colonisation rate is slight the snh proportion that minimises the delay is somewhat lower for the lower pest colonisation rate while the delay is higher for the higher pest colonisation rate for a given snh proportion figs 3e and f show the response of the simulated average yield losses on crop fields to the increasing snh proportion losses decrease with the snh proportion up to a minimum and then increase for the higher proportions we can note a parallel with the mean delay between pest colonisation and ne arrival since the shapes of the responses to the increasing snh proportion and the snh proportion values that minimise the two indicators are very close compare fig 3c and e or d and f on the contrary while the visitation rate was maximal 100 of visits of colonised crops when the proportion exceeded 25 oriented or 50 random losses still decreased when the snh proportion increased compare fig 3a and e or b and f thus the reduction of losses when increasing the snh proportion from 0 to around 75 80 is essentially due to the faster arrival of adult ne populations after the pest colonisation as opposed to a better visitation rate according to the pest colonisation rates the differences in losses for a given snh proportion are greater in comparison with the mean delays this is due to the faster crop colonisation by pests in association with higher pest colonisation rates similarly to the mean delay the pest colonisation rate has a slight influence on the snh proportion that minimises the losses while a higher pest colonisation rate is associated with a higher snh proportion from 80 to 90 for colonisation increasing from low to high values furthermore similarly to the delay the adult ne populations with an oriented dispersal are better able to reduce the crop losses because they arrive at the colonised crops faster than the adult ne populations with a random dispersal however the dispersal behaviour does not influence the snh proportion that minimises the losses figs 3g and h show the simulated yield at the landscape scale or the total yield which is the sum of the yields for all the crop fields of the landscape for any scenario the total yield globally increases with the snh proportion up to a maximum and then decreases for higher proportions consequently there is always a snh proportion that maximises the total yield however these values are much lower than those that minimise the average crop losses per crop field compare fig 3g and e or h and f for instance for the adult ne populations with an oriented dispersal while the losses were minimised for snh proportions around 80 the total yield is maximised for snh proportions around 10 20 indeed while the increasing snh proportion resulted in a better regulation of pest damage better yield per crop cell such benefits were balanced by the conversion of the cropping area to snh lower number of crop cells producing a crop yield and finally for the highest snh proportions the yield reduction due to the landcover conversion outperforms the gains due to better pest damage regulation furthermore the total yield is maximised for a lower proportion when the dispersal is oriented as opposed to random and for a given proportion the total yield is higher for oriented adult ne populations compared to oriented dispersal random dispersal is less efficient in terms of finding colonised crops and reducing losses as a consequence while the production loss due to the conversion of crops to snh is the same in random than in oriented dispersal the gain of regulation is lower for random dispersal compared to oriented here again the pest colonisation rate has a slight influence on the snh proportion that maximises the total yield while a higher pest colonisation rate is associated with a higher snh proportion especially for oriented adult ne populations 4 discussion many field studies have shown that modifying the snh proportion in an agricultural landscape is a promising management strategy for pest control since it promotes cbc tscharntke et al 2005 bianchi et al 2006 chaplin kramer et al 2011 veres et al 2013 rusch et al 2016b however its efficacy and robustness are still debated karp et al 2018 and the underlying mechanisms are not well understood begg et al 2016 our study thus aimed to better understand the consequences of increasing the snh proportion on the dynamics of ne the associated pest regulation and finally the crop yield firstly our model simulates the positive response of the pest control service to the increased snh proportion in the landscape in our simulations increasing the snh proportion results in a reduction of crop yield losses per crop cell until the extreme snh proportions this reduction is explained by both an increase in the ne visitation rate of pest colonised crops and the faster arrival of adult ne populations after the pest colonisation event higher visitation rates and faster arrival times may be the result of either a mass effect for ne because increasing the snh proportion also increases the capacity of the landscape to sustain a larger adult ne populations abundance and a distance effect because the crops to be protected are on average closer to the snh which is the starting location of adult ne populations at the beginning of the pest colonisation period however for very high snh proportions 75 in our simulations simulations show a shift in the pest control response to the snh proportion and the average crop losses even start to increase with the snh proportion indeed for these very high snh proportions the low dispersal capacity of adult ne populations makes it difficult for them to detect and disperse to colonised crops second our characterisation of the pest control service using four indicators visitation rate mean delay average crop loss and total yield allows us to explain the interplay between the influence of the temporal dynamic of trophic interactions and the landscape structure while low snh proportions maximise the visitation rate of pest colonised crops by adult ne populations the influence of the temporality of the pest colonisation and arrival of adult ne populations on the crop yield value results in much higher snh proportions to optimise the average crop losses per crop cell thus the optimal snh proportion for the average crop losses per crop cell is closer to that used for the mean delay than for the visitation rate however while increasing the snh proportion results in a better average efficiency of the pest control service in crop cells at the landscape scale the loss of productive area due to the conversion of crops to snh constrains the optimal snh proportion for the total yield which is always lower than the proportion for optimising the average crop losses finally our study also highlights the interactions between the landscape structure and ecological traits as well as their influence on the pest control service adult ne populations that disperse with an oriented movement are much more able to deliver a pest control service than those that randomly disperse we also found that the optimal snh proportion for each indicator greatly changes with the dispersal behaviour the pest colonisation rate also changes the magnitude of the pest control response and slightly influences the optimal snh proportion for a given indicator in our simulations the snh proportion that maximises the visitation rate is much lower than the proportion that minimises the average crop losses the model was able to capture this difference between visitation rate and field crop losses because we took into account the temporal aspects of the trophic interactions between crops and pests on the one hand and between pests and ne on the other to do so we used both a pest damage function defining yield loss as a function of the pest colonisation date and a pest damage regulation function defining the reduction of yield gain due to the ne regulation as a function of the time delay between pest colonisation date and the arrival of one adult ne population the two functions used were theoretical so it will be useful to calibrate them with data however calibrated functions are scarce especially those concerning the regulation of crop losses due to ne and they are often developed in a pesticide application environment e g zhang and swinton 2006 reviews of field studies dealing with the implementation of cbc e g chaplin kramer et al 2011 veres et al 2013 have underlined the lack of field evaluations for the consequences of the pest enemy dynamics in terms of crop damage and crop yield losses furthermore the data collected in such field studies are often snapshots and ignore the temporal variations within a season shackelford et al 2013 karp et al 2018 this makes it difficult to calibrate such functions a posteriori and as a result new data are required under a dedicated experimental design this data could also be used to improve existing ecological production functions for the pest control service or even build new ones such as the function developed by jonsson et al 2014 for predicting the impact of landscape composition and land use changes on cereal aphid regulation and crop losses such ecological production functions are able to capture the effect of semi natural habitats on the pest control service and could be coupled to forecasting models see for instance orozco fuentes et al 2019 and assessment methods for pest control strategies kunegel lion et al 2019 in order to implement more efficient spatial management strategies to control pests including landscape design for preventing pest outbreaks we found that there is a massive heterogeneity in the snh proportions optimising each visitation rate the field crop losses and the total yield at the landscape scale from a management point of view it follows that the optimal landscape structure could vary according to the optimisation target the first consequence in terms of concrete applications is that the use of indicators such as visitation rate is insufficient to report the pest control service and its consequences for crop yields as observed above this relates to the collection of data measuring not only the abundance of pests and enemies but also the consequences on crop yield such data is costly to collect although it was argued that focusing on outcomes and not only on processes would be relevant to help farmers perceive the potential benefits of ecological intensification which could in turn facilitate the adoption of innovative practices kleijn et al 2018 the second consequence results from the higher snh proportion that optimises the field crop losses compared to the proportion that maximises the total yield at the landscape scale this difference results from converting productive crop areas into snh yet the costs associated with converting crop areas into snh include other aspects since the implementation restoration and management of such agro ecological infrastructures can be expensive for instance long and anderson 2010 estimated the cost of a 305 m hedgerow to be around us 4 000 in california however standardised costs for these infrastructures in a large diversity of contexts are scarcely available and given the difficulty of estimating the potential benefits derived from the ecosystem services very few robust economic evaluations have been conducted to date see however morandin et al 2016 the fact that the optimal snh proportion for crop yield at the landscape scale is always lower than the proportion for field crop losses suggests that from the landscape perspective it is more profitable to target the former and share the benefits as opposed to attempting to minimise the crop losses for individual fields such a situation is possible if the collective and coordinated management of the landscape is implemented in order to take into account the interdependencies between farmers due to the movement of insects involved in the pest control service cong et al 2014 however the current management of agroecosystems still tends to be globally managed at the farm and individual scales and the shift towards landscape management would require key socio technical obstacles to be overcome salliou et al 2019 methodological progress in participatory design can help in overcoming these obstacles to plan the coordination between farmers and apply ecological knowledge from science and stakeholders in order to design agricultural landscapes that enhance the pest control service landis 2017 berthet et al 2019 see the example of hoeksche waard in the netherlands steingröver et al 2010 finally our results point to the need for different landscape structures according to the pest dynamics and types as well as the associated ne indeed the model shows that both the dispersal behaviour of ne and the pest colonisation rate influence the impact of snh on the pest control service and the optimisation of landscape structure to maximise the pest regulation in the simulations oriented enemies are much more able to deliver a pest control service for low and intermediate snh proportions while the optimal snh proportions are very different for the two tested dispersal behaviours this suggests that we should pay attention to the ecological traits of targeted ne when implementing habitat management for cbc rather than totally random the foraging behaviour of generalist predators is expected to be more or less oriented not only at short distance but also for larger scales ladybirds are highly dynamic across the landscapes and they are able to use a diversity of cues olfactive visual to orient themselves during foraging for aphid preys hodek et al 2012 even if the the long distance searching behaviour of ladybirds need further investigation visual cues e g host discolouration from aphid damage might act over large distances and help ladybirds to find suitable patches see lorenzetti et al 1997 also the mobility of ne varies greatly between generalists and specialists chaplin kramer et al 2011 and between flying and walking enemies sivakoff et al 2012 resulting in very different dispersal patterns according to the predator species such ecological traits could interact with landscape features and for instance kareiva 1987 found that habitat fragmentation impaired the searching ability of c septempunctata adults foraging in experimental arrays of goldenrod with isolated aphid populations higher pest colonisation rates reduce the pest control service and this requires higher snh proportions to reach the optimum of any indicator in this model the pest colonisation rate is independent of the trophic regulation due to ne also known as top down effects several other factors can influence this rate such as the pest identity environmental and climatic conditions and bottom up effects which describe the consequences of pest resource dynamics within the landscape the latter effect notably results from the spatio temporal pattern of the crop mosaic vasseur et al 2013 consequently the modification of the snh proportion and the management of the crop mosaic are two potentially interactive levers to lower the pest pressure rusch et al 2013 mechanistic models such as ours are useful for identifying the key features of the landscape structure and the trophic system impacting the relationship between landscape management and the pest control service according to this objective our framework could be improved by including the influence of the dynamics of the crop mosaic and the diversity of ne the spatio temporal heterogeneity of the crop mosaic can directly influence the pest dynamics bottom up effects or indirectly influence the ne dynamics and thus the potential of regulation furthermore it could be easier for farmers to manage the crop mosaic than manipulate the snh proportion kleijn et al 2018 also crops are often colonised by a complex of pest species regulated by a complex of ne as opposed to only one predator species schellhorn et al 2015 these complex trophic networks can integrate a diversity of interactions including competition or intra guild predation between enemies which may have a negative influence on pest control martin et al 2013 and 2015 finally other regulating services delivered by arthropods such as pollination are important in terms of the wide diversity of crops kremen et al 2007 habitat management at the landscape scale can also influence the dynamics of the meta populations of native insect pollinators and the delivery of pollination services kennedy et al 2013 rader et al 2016 our modelling framework can be also adapted to investigate the joint response of the two services to the landscape design and management 5 conclusion our results emphasise the importance of the interplay between the landscape structure and the temporality of the biological control function in order to influence the delivery of pest control services increasing the snh proportion at the landscape level enhances the visitation rate of pest colonised crop cells but it also reduces the delay between the pest colonisation and ne arrival at the crop fields in our simulations the average crop losses and total yield essentially depend on the delay for all the crop cells rather than on the visitation rate however while increasing the snh proportion can enhance the delivery of pest control services to individual crop cells until very high snh proportions are reached the conversion of productive crop area into snh results in a trade off as the snh proportion optimising the total yield at the landscape scale is much lower than that optimising the pest control at the cell scale overall our results suggest that improving our knowledge about the ecology of ne or the relationship between crop yield losses and the timing of events such as pest colonisation and ne arrival will help in the design of agricultural landscapes in favour of pest control with adequate snh proportions

24888,pest control is still a major issue for the agricultural sector conservation biological control which controls pests using their natural enemies ne appears to be a promising strategy considering the negative impacts of pesticides on the environment and human health conservation biological control relies on two main processes the conservation of a large abundance of ne and their biological control function per se to implement conservation biological control it was suggested to increase the proportion of semi natural habitats snh at the landscape scale because they contain important resources for ne especially for survival during overwintering however empirical studies show mixed results and the mechanisms involved are not well understood here we focus on the temporality of the biological control process as a key driver of the efficiency of pest regulation and the resulting limitation of crop yield losses using a modelling approach we analyse the interplay between the landscape structure and the spatio temporal dynamics of the interactions between crops pests and ne in a virtual agricultural landscape comprising crops and snh to characterise the pest control service we use several indicators including crop yield response defined as a function of the temporal outcomes of the species interactions we also test two ecological traits that are assumed to be important pest colonisation rate and ne dispersal behaviour we observe a positive response of the ne visitation rate of colonised crops when increasing the snh proportion however optimising the pest control service at the crop cell scale requires much more snh than maximising the visitation rate due to the influence of temporal trophic interactions indeed increasing the snh proportion makes it possible for ne to arrive at the crop cells faster after the pest colonisation which reduces the average crop losses however there is a trade off in optimising the crop yield at the cell or landscape scale because of the conversion of the productive crop area into snh overall our results suggest that modifying the snh proportion in agricultural landscapes can enhance the delivery of the pest control service provided that the landscape design allows ne to arrive at the right place at the right time in the event of pest colonisation abbreviations cbc conservation biological control ne natural enemies snh semi natural habitats keywords conservation biological control semi natural habitats timing spatially explicit and individual based model pest control crop yield 1 introduction for decades pest control has been and continues to be a major issue for the agricultural sector oerke 2006 culliney 2014 sharma et al 2017 there is an increasing need to develop alternative solutions to the use of pesticides because of their negative impacts on the environment and human health bourguet and guillemaud 2016 gaba et al 2018 some pest control strategies have been developed to benefit from biological control which is the biodiversity ecosystem function of the trophic regulation of pest populations by keystone biological agents notably arthropods costanza et al 1997 pest control using biological control is thus an important ecosystem service delivered by biodiversity and it has been shown for instance that the economic value of the pest control service attributable to insects represents us 4 5 billion annually when considering eight majors crops in the usa alone losey and vaughan 2006 conservation biological control cbc is one of the pest control strategies that benefits from the biological control of insects cbc aims to favour the presence of natural enemies ne i e native insect predators and parasitoids already present in agro ecosystems as opposed to introduced enemies landis et al 2000 it is a promising strategy because it avoids the potential negative impacts to the environment or human health relating to chemicals or introduced biological agents rusch et al 2016a van lenteren et al 2006 the conceptual framework of cbc relies on two main processes firstly the conservation of a large population of ne in the agroecosytem and secondly their biological control function per se which results in the pest suppression by ne and the limitation of pest damage on crops begg et al 2016 during this biological control process the temporal aspects of the trophic interactions between crops pests and ne can modify the relationship between pest regulation and crop yield outcomes firstly the date of the pest colonisation of crops can impact the magnitude of crop damage according to the crop phenology earlier pest colonisation relative to the age of the crop often induces more yield losses amoako atta and omolo 1983 robert 2004 bancal et al 2007 but a compensation phenomenon from the plant may also reduce the crop damage pinet et al 2015 secondly the timing of the arrival of ne at colonised crops is also a key driver of the efficiency of pest suppression and the limitation of crop yield losses costamagna et al 2015 neuville et al 2016 indeed as the pest population growth rate is generally higher than the pest removal rate by ne the latter should arrive rapidly after the pest colonisation event to regulate the pest dynamics thus the crop sowing dates and the timing of both pest colonisation and ne arrival are key factors influencing the pest regulation and the limitation of crop losses and this temporal sequence of events consequently plays an important role in the efficiency of the cbc strategy and the delivery of the pest control service the implementation of a cbc strategy to enhance pest control services can be achieved through habitat management by modifying for example the proportion of semi natural habitats snh at the landscape scale tscharntke et al 2007 holland et al 2016 indeed many arthropods involved in pest control disperse between habitats and across crop non crop interfaces in order to complete their lifecycle at spatial scales beyond the plot and farm levels rand et al 2006 schellhorn et al 2014 snh e g woodlots hedgerows floral or grass strips supply overwintering habitats alternative food resources and shelters for a wide variety of ne and they can also play the role of reservoirs for ne during pest outbreaks in the surrounding crops landis et al 2000 tscharntke et al 2007 increasing the snh proportion in the agricultural landscape should therefore result in larger ne populations and lower distances between ne sources and crops thus enhancing the visitation of colonised crops by ne several reviews and meta analyses have supported the significant positive effect of the snh proportion in the landscape on the abundance of ne but these studies also show a substantial variation in the response of the pest control service e g bianchi et al 2006 chaplin kramer et al 2011 veres et al 2013 rusch et al 2016a in particular an increase in ne abundance does not necessarily result in higher pest control or yield chaplin kramer et al 2011 in a recent analysis karp et al 2018 corroborated this variability across studies and across variables used to characterise the pest control service e g ne abundance ne predation activity pest abundance crop damage crop yield in response to the snh proportion thus while modifying the snh proportion appears to be a promising cbc to enhance the pest control services there are still important gaps in our understanding of the mechanisms relating to the landscape structure and effective limitation of crop losses through cbc here we seek to test how the temporal dynamics of the trophic interactions between crops pests and ne can affect the relationship between the landscape proportion of snh and the pest control response we also consider the influence of two functional ecological traits of importance in this context namely the pest colonisation rate of the cropping landscape and the dispersal behaviour of ne for this purpose we developed a model that simulates the dynamics of a meta population of ne and its impacts on the regulation of crop yield losses due to crop pests in an agricultural landscape comprised of both crops and snh to take into account the landscape scale processes such as the dispersal of ne and pest dynamics as well as the local scale processes such as trophic interactions between crops pests and ne in crop fields and their consequences on crop yields our model is spatially explicit and simulates the behaviour of ne populations located on crop fields that interact with their environment to evaluate the pest control service we compute four distinct indicators i the proportion of colonised crops visited by the ne ii the mean delay between pest colonisation and ne arrival events in crops iii the average crop losses per crop area unit and iv the total crop yield at the landscape scale we compare the responses of these indicators to the variation of the snh proportion and the functional traits of the pest colonisation rate and ne dispersal behaviour 2 material and methods we describe the model using the odd overview design concept and details protocol grimm et al 2006 2010 section 2 1 provides an overview of the model section 2 2 explains the design concepts section 2 3 depicts the initialisation section 2 4 describes the sub models procedures and finally section 2 5 explains the scenarios implemented for the simulation experiments all the parameters are defined in table 1 although our model deals with the conceptualisation of a cbc strategy in an agricultural landscape we also adapt it to the case of aphid pest control in annual crops i e winter wheat by flying generalist predators i e ladybirds this biological model is a classic of conservation biological control because the scenario in which a dominant crop pest in an annual cropping system is regulated by a generalist predator is common in temperate agricultural areas and has been largely covered in field studies dealing with habitat heterogeneity and pest control e g gardiner et al 2009 caballero lópez et al 2012 megan woltz and landis 2014 referring to such biological model helped us to design processes calibrate parameters and discuss the results in relation to the relevant literature cereal aphids are specialist herbivores dixon 1998 and major insect pests in cereal crops in northern europe dedryver et al 2010 each spring aphids disperse from their overwintering locations and colonise cereal fields during the stem elongating stage according to the species the life stage and the morph winged aphids are able to move trough different modes of transport and on a continuum of spatial and temporal scales van emden et harrington 2017 migrations on large distances sometimes on several dozens of kilometers thanks to passive wind transportation and active flights are unfrequent events and generally concern newly emerged alate aphids while the most majority of flight events during the lifetime of aphids are on short distance of the order of 20 m in favourable habitat and 100 m in poor habitat parry 2013 ladybirds are common and generalist agricultural predators although many species restrict their diets to one or few aphid species dixon and dixon 2000 hodek et al 2012 they are holometabolous and pass through the following stages egg larva the longer stage of the preimaginal development pupa and adults in temperate regions ladybirds have often only one generation per year the juvenile stage lasts around three weeks while adults typically live around one year hodek et al 2012 adults overwinter in non crop vegetation around crop fields and fly to colonise crops early in the growing season when prey densities begin to increase hodek et al 2012 adults are highly dynamic across the landscapes with substantial daily migration between fields in order to localise food such as plants colonised by aphids evans et richards 1997 van der werf et al 2000 individual ladybirds are not gregarious but they are strongly attracted by preys and as aphids are often clustered in agricultural areas ladybirds also aggregate on crop areas with pests volatile cues are supposed to attract ladybirds at short distance but detection of suitable patches on larger scales is still intriguing and volatiles as visual cues could be involved lorenzetti et al 1997 hodek et al 2012 adults stop when preys are sufficiently abundant in order to limit the important cannibalism of their larvae the number of laid eggs is proportional to the density of aphids until a certain threshold which modulates the final capacity of pest regulation hodek et al 2012 adults generally fly away after laying eggs in order to limit competition larvae are able to eat a large number of aphids and they greatly contribute to the regulation of the aphid density and impact contrary to adults their mobility is very limited because they are not winged and as a consequence they generally stay on the crop plant they were born or only move to the immediately neighbooring plants 2 1 overview 2 1 1 purpose the purpose of this model is to simulate the influence of the temporal dynamics of trophic interactions between crops pests and ne on the response to pest control services while considering variations in the snh proportion in the landscape we also consider how two ecological traits namely pest colonisation rate and ne dispersal behaviour can affect this relationship 2 1 2 state variables and scales the agricultural landscape is represented by a spatial grid and discretised in 33 33 square cells each cell of the grid is characterised by its landcover and can be either a snh i e a non cultivated and non intensively managed element with woody herbaceous or natural vegetation or a crop field i e a plot of annual crops such as winter wheat we scale the cells to a size of approximately 1 ha each resulting in a square spatial domain of around 3 3 km such cell scale corresponds more or less to one field plot which is the management scale for landcover in agricultural landscapes furthermore it is also compatible with dispersal processes of ladybirds which are able to move from field to field at a daily rate hodek et al 2012 evans et richards 1997 van der werf et al 2000 a simulated agricultural landscape grid is characterised by a fixed proportion p of snh cells with a certain level of aggregation g in real landscapes the total number of insects pests or ne present in such a cell area can be very great for simplicity of modelling and computations we do not model pest and ne individuals but rather populations of insects covering one whole cell thus one cell is always considered as free occupied by pests by ne or simultaneously by pests and ne as in a meta population model we assume that pest dynamics is implicit and deterministic modelled as a pest colonisation rate of the crop cells at the landscape scale each day a certain proportion of crop cells free of pests are thus colonised according to a random spatial pattern this random colonisation can be considered as the initial migratory flight on large distance of newly emerged aphids through passive transportation and randomly landing on suitable crop cells we assume that every colonised crop cell is covered by the same initial number of pest individuals as aphids generally move on short distances after landing from their large initial flight we also assume that pests cover the whole area of the colonised crop cell but are not able to colonise other crop cells in the agricultural landscape including the neighbouring ones we therefore assume that the pest colonisation process is independent of the pest dynamics within the agricultural landscape contrary to pests we explicitly model ne populations which allows us to investigate the interaction between the landscape features and the influence of ne dispersal behaviour we assume that ne populations are large groups of individual ne covering one cell all the ne populations have the same size and all the individuals of one ne population share the same characteristics they have the same age are on the same stage die at the same time and have the same behaviour in particular the same dispersal behaviour we assume that ne populations can be either adult all the individuals are adult or juveniles all the individuals are juvenile as for ladybirds adult ne are able to fly and they can move on long distances from field to field on the contrary juvenile ne stay on the cell they were born until converting into adults because they are not able to fly we also assume that all the individuals of one juvenile ne population convert to adults at the same time and as a consequence when one juvenile ne population has grown enough it is converted to one adult ne population we assume that at the beginning of one season a certain number of adult ne populations are located into snh cells as crops are colonised by pests during this period adult ne populations are moving from cell to cell in order to find colonised crops we therefore assume that all the individuals of one adult ne population move on the same direction if ladybirds are not gregarious they use a diversity of clues to find preys for instance olfactory and visual one and they are strongly attracted by such clues aggregating on locations with preys as a consequence we assume that such individual dispersal behaviour when considering a large number of insects located on the same field can be modelled by the dispersal of a whole population at the field spatial grain once one adult ne population has found a crop cell colonised by pests the ne population stops feeds and reproduces giving birth to a new juvenile ne population only one new juvenile population is produced during each reproduction event but one adult ne population can reproduce as many times as it finds a new colonised crop cell after this reproduction event the adult ne population moves from the crop cell while the juvenile ne population stays on the crop cell feeding on pest preys until converting into a new adult ne population able to fly we also assume that when one adult ne population or one juvenile ne population stays on one crop cell other adult ne populations can not stop on the same crop cell indeed ladybirds avoid competition for preys and limit the residence time or the number of laid eggs when their densities juveniles and adults are too high during dispersal adult ne populations suffer a mortality rate due for instance to environmental factors or the lack of energy and when a mortality event occurs we assume that all the individual of the population die at the same time resulting in the suppression of the whole ne population at the end of the season adult ne populations search for overwintering habitats and try to move in snh because juvenile and adult ne populations will not survive to the winter in crops like for crop cells we assume that one adult ne population located on one crop cell covers the whole cell snh cells sharing at least one edge form a snh cluster and we assume that one cluster has a limited carrying capacity i e only a limited number of adult ne populations located on this cluster will be able to survive after the overwintering period this carrying capacity depends on the cluster size the number of snh cells and of the carrying capacity of each crop cell called k for instance in our simulations k 0 5 and each adult ne population requires two snh cells of the cluster to overwinter this means that adult ne populations will not be able to survive in isolated crop cells and that the maximal number of adult ne populations that one snh cluster can shelter during the overwintering period corresponds to the half of its own number of snh cells finally we also assume that one adult ne population lives one year because ladybirds have also only one generation per year in temperate areas as a consequence we assume that if one adult ne population was born during the year y it will die before the end of the year y 1 furthermore in order to depict the species interactions between crop plants pests and ne in crop cells during the year each crop cell is characterised by a state variable called s this variable can take six states fig 1 i pest free i e not yet colonised by pests ii non detectable i e pests have only just colonised this crop cell but the pest population size is still limited so pests are not yet detectable by adult ne populations iii detectable i e the pest population in the crop cell has grown enough to make detection possible by adult ne populations but there is not yet ne settled on the cell iv occupied by adult ne i e an adult ne population has found the pests and stopped in the crop cell in order to feed on them and reproduce other adult ne population can not stop to feed nor reproduce on the cell v occupied by juvenile ne i e after reproducing and giving birth to a new juvenile ne population the adult ne population flies away whereas juveniles remain in the crop cell and feed on the pests until converting into adults as for the previous state other adult ne population can not stop to feed nor reproduce on the cell vi regulated i e once the juvenile ne population becomes an adult ne population this population flies away and the pest population on the cell is considered as controlled this crop cell cannot be colonised again by pests before the end of the year or being attractive for other adult ne populations indeed we assume that once one crop cell is colonised the pest population on this cell is growing exponentially in absence of regulation the sooner this colonisation event occurs the more the pest population will grow and induce an important impact on crop yield when one adult ne population stops and reproduces on one colonised crop cell we assume that the regulation capacity of ne or the proportion of pests they control and the impact of pests on crop yield will depend on the delay between the pest colonisation and the arrival of ne if ne arrive just after the pest colonisation they will be able to suppress entirely the pest population and the impact on crop yield will be minimal on the contrary if they arrive later they will only partially control pests and the impact on crop yield will be higher however even if the whole pest population was not suppressed we assume that the remaining pests after ne location do not influence the colonisation of other crop cells in the landscape nor the colonisation during the following year furthermore in order to compute the crop yield losses resulting from these trophic interactions between crops pests and ne we have characterised each crop cell by two variables that collect the dates for the events of pest colonisation d1 and the arrival of ne d2 on this crop cell because we assume that these timings are the drivers of the outcomes of the predator prey dynamics see section 2 2 observations for details 2 1 3 process overview and scheduling each year is divided into three successive periods i the pest colonisation period ii the take shelter period and iii the overwintering period while the model proceeds at daily time steps during the two first periods which continue for d1 time steps for pest colonisation 150 days in our simulations and d2 time steps for take shelter 30 days in our simulations the overwintering period is computed in a single time step for each model time step a certain sequence of events occurs and the nature of these events depends on the period once the three periods are completed a new year begins this time scheduling and the corresponding sequences of events are shown in fig 2 at the beginning of the pest colonisation period adult ne populations are located in the snh where they are overwintering as soon as the pest colonisation period begins pests colonise crops with a speed according to the pest colonisation rate procedure pestcolonisation section 2 4 2 adult ne populations then leave the snh and disperse within the landscape grid procedure dispersing section 2 4 5 whenever they move to a crop they can experience mortality procedure mortality section 2 4 4 adult ne populations can not stop nor feed on crop cells already occupied by other ne adults or juveniles once one adult ne population has found a crop colonised by pests but free of other ne adults or juveniles the ne population stops to feed and reproduces there after l2 days 7 days in our simulations matching with the time for ladybirds to lay eggs after they mate the adult ne population gives birth to one single population of juveniles procedure updatecropstate section 2 4 3 and flies away procedure dispersing section 2 4 5 the juvenile population remains on the crop where it was born for l3 days 21 days in our simulations matching with the time for ladybird larvae to complete the whole juvenile stage feeding on pests until converting into an adult ne population procedure updatecropstate section 2 4 3 and then flying away to find other colonised crops procedure dispersing section 2 4 5 the number of reproduction events for one adult ne population is not limited and while the pest colonisation period has not ended the adult ne populations can give birth to new ne if they find detectable crops as described above these interactions between ne and pests on crops are included in the states of crop cells the transitions between these states and the timings of pest and ne arrivals procedure updatecropstate section 2 4 3 after d1 days 150 in our simulations the pest colonisation period ends and the take shelter period begins during this period adult ne populations no longer stop at crops even if they are colonised by pests instead adult ne populations move towards the snh procedure backtosnh section 2 4 6 they are still experiencing mortality during this movement procedure mortality section 2 4 4 if juveniles convert into adults during this period procedure updatecropstate section 2 4 3 they adopt the adult behaviour after d2 days 30 in our simulations the take shelter period ends and the overwintering period starts adult and juvenile ne populations die if they are still located in crops when this period starts on the contrary one adult ne population in the snh can survive or die according to the carrying capacity of the snh cluster where ne have found a shelter procedure overwintering section 2 4 7 2 2 design concepts 2 2 1 basic principles ne are mobile agents and during the season adult ne populations move from snh to crops in order to find pests and reproduce and then they come back to snh for overwintering the pest dynamics are deterministic and modelled as a pest colonisation rate at the landscape scale the interplay between the landscape structure proportion and arrangement of snh its spatio temporal dynamics pest colonisation of the crops and the dispersal behaviour of adult ne populations results in local species interactions between crops pests and ne species interactions involve a temporal sequence of events firstly the pest colonisation followed by the arrival of adult ne populations in each crop cell the final yield losses depend on the timing of these events 2 2 2 emergence the main emergent properties are the movement and dynamics of the meta population of adult ne populations as well as the delivery of the pest control service 2 2 3 interactions we considered trophic interactions between crops pests and ne we also considered competition between ne as one adult ne population cannot stop and reproduce in crop cells already occupied by other adult or juvenile ne population adult ne populations also compete for snh during overwintering and every cluster of snh cells has its own limited carrying capacity that determines the final number of adult ne populations surviving the winter period in the cluster each snh cluster can shelter a maximum number of adult ne populations equal to number of cells in the cluster k where k is the carrying capacity of one snh cell with k 0 5 in our simulations 2 2 4 stochasticity for each simulation we generated a new virtual landscape characterised by the indicators of snh proportion p between 0 and 95 of snh cells and aggregation g g 9 corresponding to the strong aggregation of snh cells according to the given simulation scenario we chose in our scenarios to focus on landscapes with a strong aggregation of snh g 9 and only the snh proportion was varying in order to deal with the stochasticity we repeated each scenario a combination between the values for snh proportion pest colonisation rate and dispersal behaviour 150 times see section 2 5 during the initialisation step the allocation of adult ne populations initial number n 25 in snh cells is randomly chosen furthermore the spatial assignation of pest colonised crops during the pest colonisation period is also randomised among the crops that are not yet colonised the mortality of adult ne populations associated with their movement in crops is modelled using a bernoulli trial m 0 1 during overwintering adult ne populations that die are randomly chosen when the carrying capacity of the snh cell cluster is exceeded k 0 5 2 2 5 observation we simulated the abundance of ne populations adult and juvenile populations over time as well as the abundance of crops with the different states s pest free non detectable detectable occupied by adult ne populations occupied by juvenile ne populations regulated to evaluate the pest control service delivery during a year we used four distinct indicators i the visitation rate which is the fraction of crop cells colonised by pests that are also visited by ne ii the mean time elapsed between the pest colonisation date and the arrival date of one adult ne population in each crop cell iii the average crop losses in crop cells due to the crop pest ne interactions and iv the total crop production at the landscape scale to compute the final crop yield y of a given crop cell at the end of the year we considered the difference between a theoretical and maximal crop yield in the absence of pests and the actual crop loss value due to pests ψ 1 y 100 ψ the actual crop losses ψ of a given crop cell is the difference between the theoretical crop loss due to pests in the absence of regulation ψth and the reduction of crop losses due to the regulation by ne δψ ψth where δψ is the reduction coefficient of crop losses 2 ψ ψ t h 1 δ ψ the theoretical crop losses ψth of a crop cell colonised by pests depicts the response of yield to the crop pest interactions in absence of regulation by ne this value is a decreasing function of the date of arrival of pests d1 at the crops fig sa1 appendix a 3 ψ t h d 1 m 1 e q 1 d 1 1 where m1 is the maximal theoretical crop losses and q1 a time reduction coefficient if pests have not colonised the crop cell then ψth 0 the function decreases with time meaning that the later the pests colonise crops the less crop losses they will induce we thus assumed that the later the pests colonise the crops the less time they have to grow in terms of population size and the less damage they will inflict on the crop plant robert 2004 bancal et al 2007 the reduction of crop losses δψ ψth is the consequence of the regulation of the pest population growth by ne when they stop at a colonised crop δψ is the reduction coefficient of crop losses and this value is a function of the time d2 d1 elapsed between the pest colonisation and the arrival of one adult ne population fig sa2 appendix a 4 δ ψ d 2 d 1 1 100 m 2 1 e q 2 d 2 d 1 h 1 m 3 where m2 is the maximal capacity of crop loss reduction by the ne regulation h the time required for the crop losses to reduce to half of its maximum value m3 the minimal capacity and q2 the time reduction coefficient the later the adult ne population stops and reproduces at a crop cell after its colonisation by pests the less these ne are able to regulate the pests and reduce the crop losses this mechanism has been shown in manipulative studies where an early colonisation of crop fields by ne during the pest colonisation period was related to a better pest suppression indeed early colonisation by ne slows pest population growth before it reaches an exponentially increasing trajectory ives and settle 1997 hopper et al 1995 finally the total crop production at the landscape scale can be computed at the end of the year by summing the yield of each crop cell snh cells do not supply any yield 2 3 initialisation for each simulation a landscape grid is initialised initlandscape section 2 4 1 and an initial number of adult ne populations initial number n 25 are randomly located in the snh after this initialisation the model can simulate several years nyears with here nyears 20 years of data 2 4 submodels 2 4 1 procedure initlandscape this procedure generates a virtual landscape with an assigned proportion of snh p 0 95 from 5 to 5 and their level of aggregation g we focused only on landscapes with strong aggregation of the snh cells i e g 9 this aggregation parameter is related to the average number of snh cells neighbouring each snh cell moore neighbourhood the lower values of g indicate a landscape with scattered snh while higher values of g indicate a landscape with very clustered snh the procedure first creates a two dimensional landscape grid with the proportions p of snh cells and 1 p crop cells according to a totally random spatial pattern at each iteration of the algorithm the parameter g is calculated if the calculated g is lower than its target value it means that the snh cells should be more aggregated and a snh cell with lower number of snh neighbours is switched to a crop cell and a crop cell close to a snh cell with higher snh neighbours is switched to crop the opposite if g is higher than its target value iterations stop when the calculated g and its target value are sufficiently close their difference is lower than a precision threshold put equal to 0 1 in our simulations since not all the values of g are possible for given p it is possible that the algorithm does not converge therefore another condition for stopping the algorithm is if 1500 iterations are reached which is generally more then sufficient in a 33 33 cells landscape once the grid is created this procedure also identifies the clusters of snh group of semi natural cells that share at least one edge cells other than snh are crops and they are characterised by the state s pest free finally adult ne populations are randomly allocated on snh initial number n 25 2 4 2 procedure pestcolonisation in this procedure a fixed proportion i of the crop cells is selected for every daily time step of the pest colonisation period to be colonised by pests fig 1 this parameter i is called the pest colonisation intensity and it drives two aspects of the pest dynamics which correspond to the total number of crop cells colonised throughout the year and the colonisation speed in our simulations i was varying between 1 and 8 i e between 1 and 8 of the total of crop cells are colonised by pests every daily time step until all the crop cells are colonised which are strong rates as all the crop cells have been colonised during a year furthermore we adopted a spatial random pattern for the pest colonisation and the crops that are converted from pest free to non detectable are randomly chosen from among the pest free crops for the sake of simplicity we do not consider the role of a pest spreading from cell to cell potentially due to the proximity and short distance active movements or the potential role of snh acting as sources of pests tscharntke et al 2016 considering the specific case of aphids this pattern can correspond to passive wind transportation over long distances from outside the landscape without the capacity to control the landing with precision this is sometimes called aphid rain parry 2013 2 4 3 procedure updatecropstate this procedure considers the transitions of a crop cell to the different states these transitions are driven by conditions based on the interactions between crops pests and ne as well as temporality see section 2 1 2 and fig 1 once a pest free crop has been selected to be colonised by pests procedure pestcolonisation the procedure updatecropstate converts the crop to the non detectable state we assume that the size of the initial pest population colonising a crop is very limited and consequently ne are not able to detect these pests the pest population can grow until it reaches a detectable size which occurs after l1 days 7 days in our simulation this temporal condition allows the crop to transition from the non detectable to the detectable state once one adult ne population has stopped at a detectable crop the procedure converts the cell to the state occupied by adult ne after l2 days 7 days in our simulations spent on the crop the adult ne population gives birth to one juvenile population and leaves the crop which induces the crop s transition to the state occupied by juvenile ne these juveniles feed on pests and grow on the crop during l3 days 21 days in our simulations and then convert to an adult ne population which leaves the cell the crop is then converted to the regulated state which forbids any new pest colonisation until the end of the year in addition to the transitions between crop states the procedure updatecropstate retains for any crop cell the dates d1 and d2 respectively corresponding to the pest colonisation of the crop cell and the arrival of the first adult ne population while the crop cell is in the state detectable 2 4 4 procedure mortality for every dispersal movement during the two successive periods of the pest colonisation or take shelter periods we define m as the mortality probability of adult ne populations due to external events or lack of energy as we assume that all the individuals of the same ne population face the same events on the same moment all these individuals die on the same time resulting in the suppression of the whole ne population mortality is modelled as a bernoulli trial 2 4 5 procedure dispersing this procedure rules the movements of adult ne populations during the first period of the pest colonisation period during this period and at every daily time step adult ne populations can orient themselves towards a directional cell and then move to the adjacent cell in the same direction as this directional cell according to the moore neighborhood i e a central cell and the eight cells which surround it on a two dimensional square lattice which allowed for diagonal movements adult ne populations move if they have not found a detectable crop where they can stop and reproduce or as soon as they have reproduced in order to find another detectable crop to orient themselves adult ne populations can evaluate the cells around their current location according to a distance radius r and they must pick one directional cell in this radius two distinct dispersal behaviours are then possible in the case of random dispersal ne randomly move to a directional cell in the radius in the case of oriented dispersal ne can detect detectable crops in the radius and identify the crop with the largest pest population i e the crop colonised for the longest time in order to choose it as the directional cell 2 4 6 procedure backtosnh this procedure determines the movements of adult ne populations during the second period of the year known as the take shelter period during this period adult ne populations try to find a snh to overwinter at every daily time step of this period we consider that adult ne populations detect the closest snh from their current location orient themselves towards it pick the neighbouring cell to their current location in the same direction as the closest snh cell and then move to it 2 4 7 procedure overwintering this procedure considers the mortality of ne during overwintering as there is one generation of ne per year adult ne populations that were born during the previous year die as ne can only overwinter in the snh not in crops the juvenile and adult ne populations that are still in crops during the transition between the take shelter and overwintering periods also die during the winter period the adult ne populations located in a snh overwinter the snh clusters have a limited carrying capacity in terms of resources which could limit the total number of ne surviving the winter period in a cluster then for every snh cluster the procedure computes the total number of adult ne populations that are located in the cluster and compares this number to the carrying capacity of the cluster which equals the total number of snh cells in the latter by the carrying capacity of snh cells called k with k 0 5 in our simulations if the number of adult ne populations is greater than the carrying capacity of the snh cluster the adult ne populations in excess are randomly chosen among the ones in the cluster and then die the surviving adult ne populations are then randomly dispatched on the snh cells in the cluster 2 5 scenarios for the simulation experiments we considered six scenarios according to a factorial design based on the distinct levels for the pest colonisation rate i 2 4 8 and the dispersal behaviour of adult ne populations random or oriented for each scenario we varied the snh proportion p between 0 and 95 at intervals of 5 in order to understand the influence of the snh proportion given the pest colonisation rate and the dispersal behaviour of adult ne populations we focused on landscapes with a strong aggregation of snh g 9 each combination pest colonisation rate x dispersal behaviour x snh proportion is repeated 150 times in order to cope with stochasticity parameters are set with the same values for every run see table 1 we stopped the simulations after nyears 20 years to be sure that the dynamics of the pest ne system enter a phase of permanent regime we obtained the outputs described in the observation part of the design concepts section taken from the end of the seventh year and that we used for figures we used netlogo 6 0 2 wilensky 1999 for running the scenarios and r 3 4 4 for the results 3 results figs 3 a and b show the proportion of crops colonised by pests and then visited by adult ne populations during the final year of the simulation known here as the visitation rate this visitation rate increases with the snh proportion and reaches 100 for both ne dispersal behaviours and all the pest colonisation rates however ne dispersal behaviour has an influence on the relationship between the snh proportion and visitation rate since ne are more efficient in visiting colonised crops when the dispersal is oriented rather than random furthermore the minimal snh proportions needed to reach 100 of visits are 25 and 50 for oriented and random dispersal respectively before reaching the plateau of 100 of visits for colonised crops the pest colonisation rate has a slight influence on the visitation rate for a given snh proportion thus the higher the pest colonisation rate the higher the visitation rate but this effect decreases when the pest colonisation rate increases the pest colonisation rate does not influence the value of the snh proportion that makes 100 of visits possible finally but only in the case of random dispersal the visitation rate decreases when the snh proportion becomes extreme 85 figs 3c and d show the average time delay between colonisation date and ne arrival for crops colonised by pests and visited by ne for any scenario of dispersal behaviour and pest colonisation rate this delay initially decreases when the snh proportion increases up to a minimum and then starts to increase for the highest snh values thus there is always a snh proportion value minimising this delay between pest colonisation and ne arrival it is important to note that these snh proportions are much higher than those making it possible to reach 100 of visits of colonised crops compare fig 3a and c or b and d furthermore adult ne populations with an oriented dispersal behaviour arrive at colonised crops much faster than those with a random dispersal on the contrary the influence of the pest colonisation rate is slight the snh proportion that minimises the delay is somewhat lower for the lower pest colonisation rate while the delay is higher for the higher pest colonisation rate for a given snh proportion figs 3e and f show the response of the simulated average yield losses on crop fields to the increasing snh proportion losses decrease with the snh proportion up to a minimum and then increase for the higher proportions we can note a parallel with the mean delay between pest colonisation and ne arrival since the shapes of the responses to the increasing snh proportion and the snh proportion values that minimise the two indicators are very close compare fig 3c and e or d and f on the contrary while the visitation rate was maximal 100 of visits of colonised crops when the proportion exceeded 25 oriented or 50 random losses still decreased when the snh proportion increased compare fig 3a and e or b and f thus the reduction of losses when increasing the snh proportion from 0 to around 75 80 is essentially due to the faster arrival of adult ne populations after the pest colonisation as opposed to a better visitation rate according to the pest colonisation rates the differences in losses for a given snh proportion are greater in comparison with the mean delays this is due to the faster crop colonisation by pests in association with higher pest colonisation rates similarly to the mean delay the pest colonisation rate has a slight influence on the snh proportion that minimises the losses while a higher pest colonisation rate is associated with a higher snh proportion from 80 to 90 for colonisation increasing from low to high values furthermore similarly to the delay the adult ne populations with an oriented dispersal are better able to reduce the crop losses because they arrive at the colonised crops faster than the adult ne populations with a random dispersal however the dispersal behaviour does not influence the snh proportion that minimises the losses figs 3g and h show the simulated yield at the landscape scale or the total yield which is the sum of the yields for all the crop fields of the landscape for any scenario the total yield globally increases with the snh proportion up to a maximum and then decreases for higher proportions consequently there is always a snh proportion that maximises the total yield however these values are much lower than those that minimise the average crop losses per crop field compare fig 3g and e or h and f for instance for the adult ne populations with an oriented dispersal while the losses were minimised for snh proportions around 80 the total yield is maximised for snh proportions around 10 20 indeed while the increasing snh proportion resulted in a better regulation of pest damage better yield per crop cell such benefits were balanced by the conversion of the cropping area to snh lower number of crop cells producing a crop yield and finally for the highest snh proportions the yield reduction due to the landcover conversion outperforms the gains due to better pest damage regulation furthermore the total yield is maximised for a lower proportion when the dispersal is oriented as opposed to random and for a given proportion the total yield is higher for oriented adult ne populations compared to oriented dispersal random dispersal is less efficient in terms of finding colonised crops and reducing losses as a consequence while the production loss due to the conversion of crops to snh is the same in random than in oriented dispersal the gain of regulation is lower for random dispersal compared to oriented here again the pest colonisation rate has a slight influence on the snh proportion that maximises the total yield while a higher pest colonisation rate is associated with a higher snh proportion especially for oriented adult ne populations 4 discussion many field studies have shown that modifying the snh proportion in an agricultural landscape is a promising management strategy for pest control since it promotes cbc tscharntke et al 2005 bianchi et al 2006 chaplin kramer et al 2011 veres et al 2013 rusch et al 2016b however its efficacy and robustness are still debated karp et al 2018 and the underlying mechanisms are not well understood begg et al 2016 our study thus aimed to better understand the consequences of increasing the snh proportion on the dynamics of ne the associated pest regulation and finally the crop yield firstly our model simulates the positive response of the pest control service to the increased snh proportion in the landscape in our simulations increasing the snh proportion results in a reduction of crop yield losses per crop cell until the extreme snh proportions this reduction is explained by both an increase in the ne visitation rate of pest colonised crops and the faster arrival of adult ne populations after the pest colonisation event higher visitation rates and faster arrival times may be the result of either a mass effect for ne because increasing the snh proportion also increases the capacity of the landscape to sustain a larger adult ne populations abundance and a distance effect because the crops to be protected are on average closer to the snh which is the starting location of adult ne populations at the beginning of the pest colonisation period however for very high snh proportions 75 in our simulations simulations show a shift in the pest control response to the snh proportion and the average crop losses even start to increase with the snh proportion indeed for these very high snh proportions the low dispersal capacity of adult ne populations makes it difficult for them to detect and disperse to colonised crops second our characterisation of the pest control service using four indicators visitation rate mean delay average crop loss and total yield allows us to explain the interplay between the influence of the temporal dynamic of trophic interactions and the landscape structure while low snh proportions maximise the visitation rate of pest colonised crops by adult ne populations the influence of the temporality of the pest colonisation and arrival of adult ne populations on the crop yield value results in much higher snh proportions to optimise the average crop losses per crop cell thus the optimal snh proportion for the average crop losses per crop cell is closer to that used for the mean delay than for the visitation rate however while increasing the snh proportion results in a better average efficiency of the pest control service in crop cells at the landscape scale the loss of productive area due to the conversion of crops to snh constrains the optimal snh proportion for the total yield which is always lower than the proportion for optimising the average crop losses finally our study also highlights the interactions between the landscape structure and ecological traits as well as their influence on the pest control service adult ne populations that disperse with an oriented movement are much more able to deliver a pest control service than those that randomly disperse we also found that the optimal snh proportion for each indicator greatly changes with the dispersal behaviour the pest colonisation rate also changes the magnitude of the pest control response and slightly influences the optimal snh proportion for a given indicator in our simulations the snh proportion that maximises the visitation rate is much lower than the proportion that minimises the average crop losses the model was able to capture this difference between visitation rate and field crop losses because we took into account the temporal aspects of the trophic interactions between crops and pests on the one hand and between pests and ne on the other to do so we used both a pest damage function defining yield loss as a function of the pest colonisation date and a pest damage regulation function defining the reduction of yield gain due to the ne regulation as a function of the time delay between pest colonisation date and the arrival of one adult ne population the two functions used were theoretical so it will be useful to calibrate them with data however calibrated functions are scarce especially those concerning the regulation of crop losses due to ne and they are often developed in a pesticide application environment e g zhang and swinton 2006 reviews of field studies dealing with the implementation of cbc e g chaplin kramer et al 2011 veres et al 2013 have underlined the lack of field evaluations for the consequences of the pest enemy dynamics in terms of crop damage and crop yield losses furthermore the data collected in such field studies are often snapshots and ignore the temporal variations within a season shackelford et al 2013 karp et al 2018 this makes it difficult to calibrate such functions a posteriori and as a result new data are required under a dedicated experimental design this data could also be used to improve existing ecological production functions for the pest control service or even build new ones such as the function developed by jonsson et al 2014 for predicting the impact of landscape composition and land use changes on cereal aphid regulation and crop losses such ecological production functions are able to capture the effect of semi natural habitats on the pest control service and could be coupled to forecasting models see for instance orozco fuentes et al 2019 and assessment methods for pest control strategies kunegel lion et al 2019 in order to implement more efficient spatial management strategies to control pests including landscape design for preventing pest outbreaks we found that there is a massive heterogeneity in the snh proportions optimising each visitation rate the field crop losses and the total yield at the landscape scale from a management point of view it follows that the optimal landscape structure could vary according to the optimisation target the first consequence in terms of concrete applications is that the use of indicators such as visitation rate is insufficient to report the pest control service and its consequences for crop yields as observed above this relates to the collection of data measuring not only the abundance of pests and enemies but also the consequences on crop yield such data is costly to collect although it was argued that focusing on outcomes and not only on processes would be relevant to help farmers perceive the potential benefits of ecological intensification which could in turn facilitate the adoption of innovative practices kleijn et al 2018 the second consequence results from the higher snh proportion that optimises the field crop losses compared to the proportion that maximises the total yield at the landscape scale this difference results from converting productive crop areas into snh yet the costs associated with converting crop areas into snh include other aspects since the implementation restoration and management of such agro ecological infrastructures can be expensive for instance long and anderson 2010 estimated the cost of a 305 m hedgerow to be around us 4 000 in california however standardised costs for these infrastructures in a large diversity of contexts are scarcely available and given the difficulty of estimating the potential benefits derived from the ecosystem services very few robust economic evaluations have been conducted to date see however morandin et al 2016 the fact that the optimal snh proportion for crop yield at the landscape scale is always lower than the proportion for field crop losses suggests that from the landscape perspective it is more profitable to target the former and share the benefits as opposed to attempting to minimise the crop losses for individual fields such a situation is possible if the collective and coordinated management of the landscape is implemented in order to take into account the interdependencies between farmers due to the movement of insects involved in the pest control service cong et al 2014 however the current management of agroecosystems still tends to be globally managed at the farm and individual scales and the shift towards landscape management would require key socio technical obstacles to be overcome salliou et al 2019 methodological progress in participatory design can help in overcoming these obstacles to plan the coordination between farmers and apply ecological knowledge from science and stakeholders in order to design agricultural landscapes that enhance the pest control service landis 2017 berthet et al 2019 see the example of hoeksche waard in the netherlands steingröver et al 2010 finally our results point to the need for different landscape structures according to the pest dynamics and types as well as the associated ne indeed the model shows that both the dispersal behaviour of ne and the pest colonisation rate influence the impact of snh on the pest control service and the optimisation of landscape structure to maximise the pest regulation in the simulations oriented enemies are much more able to deliver a pest control service for low and intermediate snh proportions while the optimal snh proportions are very different for the two tested dispersal behaviours this suggests that we should pay attention to the ecological traits of targeted ne when implementing habitat management for cbc rather than totally random the foraging behaviour of generalist predators is expected to be more or less oriented not only at short distance but also for larger scales ladybirds are highly dynamic across the landscapes and they are able to use a diversity of cues olfactive visual to orient themselves during foraging for aphid preys hodek et al 2012 even if the the long distance searching behaviour of ladybirds need further investigation visual cues e g host discolouration from aphid damage might act over large distances and help ladybirds to find suitable patches see lorenzetti et al 1997 also the mobility of ne varies greatly between generalists and specialists chaplin kramer et al 2011 and between flying and walking enemies sivakoff et al 2012 resulting in very different dispersal patterns according to the predator species such ecological traits could interact with landscape features and for instance kareiva 1987 found that habitat fragmentation impaired the searching ability of c septempunctata adults foraging in experimental arrays of goldenrod with isolated aphid populations higher pest colonisation rates reduce the pest control service and this requires higher snh proportions to reach the optimum of any indicator in this model the pest colonisation rate is independent of the trophic regulation due to ne also known as top down effects several other factors can influence this rate such as the pest identity environmental and climatic conditions and bottom up effects which describe the consequences of pest resource dynamics within the landscape the latter effect notably results from the spatio temporal pattern of the crop mosaic vasseur et al 2013 consequently the modification of the snh proportion and the management of the crop mosaic are two potentially interactive levers to lower the pest pressure rusch et al 2013 mechanistic models such as ours are useful for identifying the key features of the landscape structure and the trophic system impacting the relationship between landscape management and the pest control service according to this objective our framework could be improved by including the influence of the dynamics of the crop mosaic and the diversity of ne the spatio temporal heterogeneity of the crop mosaic can directly influence the pest dynamics bottom up effects or indirectly influence the ne dynamics and thus the potential of regulation furthermore it could be easier for farmers to manage the crop mosaic than manipulate the snh proportion kleijn et al 2018 also crops are often colonised by a complex of pest species regulated by a complex of ne as opposed to only one predator species schellhorn et al 2015 these complex trophic networks can integrate a diversity of interactions including competition or intra guild predation between enemies which may have a negative influence on pest control martin et al 2013 and 2015 finally other regulating services delivered by arthropods such as pollination are important in terms of the wide diversity of crops kremen et al 2007 habitat management at the landscape scale can also influence the dynamics of the meta populations of native insect pollinators and the delivery of pollination services kennedy et al 2013 rader et al 2016 our modelling framework can be also adapted to investigate the joint response of the two services to the landscape design and management 5 conclusion our results emphasise the importance of the interplay between the landscape structure and the temporality of the biological control function in order to influence the delivery of pest control services increasing the snh proportion at the landscape level enhances the visitation rate of pest colonised crop cells but it also reduces the delay between the pest colonisation and ne arrival at the crop fields in our simulations the average crop losses and total yield essentially depend on the delay for all the crop cells rather than on the visitation rate however while increasing the snh proportion can enhance the delivery of pest control services to individual crop cells until very high snh proportions are reached the conversion of productive crop area into snh results in a trade off as the snh proportion optimising the total yield at the landscape scale is much lower than that optimising the pest control at the cell scale overall our results suggest that improving our knowledge about the ecology of ne or the relationship between crop yield losses and the timing of events such as pest colonisation and ne arrival will help in the design of agricultural landscapes in favour of pest control with adequate snh proportions

24889,the physiological development of insect pests is driven by temperature and photoperiod geographic variations in the speed of growth reflect current patterns in thermal conditions as a function of latitude and altitude global warming will likely lead to shifts in pests phenology insects are expected to overwinter earlier and develop more generations with implications for the risks of damage to agricultural crops understanding and monitoring of the voltinism of insect pests will be increasingly important to anticipate critical phases of pest development and devise options for adapting pest control measures in this study we describe a new generic phenological model that allows to reproduce the voltinism of lobesia botrana a major insect pest that affect grapevine production vitis vinifera l worldwide inspired by existing models the lobesia generic model lgm combines two submodels representing the overwintering period and the dates of flight of subsequent generations of male insects this model uses a unique beta function for representing the temperature responses of both the overwintering generation as well as the adult generations the results indicate that lgm is able to simulate l botrana voltinism under climatic conditions ranging from those observed in southern spain to those recorded in the alsace region france the lgm only requires a single set of parameters valid for all the generations with a precision of around 7 days rmse allowing a simple use with parameters representative of natural behaviour and found in the existing literature keywords generic phenological modelling lobesia botrana voltinism process based model temperature photoperiod 1 introduction modern agriculture relies on the massive use of pesticides to increase productivity tilman et al 2002 this has caused considerable stress on biodiversity and made insect pests more resistant to pesticides hatt et al 2018 furthermore extensive commercial trade as well as increasing temperatures have enhanced the spread of insect pests as a result invasive species have started to damage crops in remote areas bale et al 2002 lin 2011 lamichhane et al 2015 understanding and predicting insect pest dynamics is necessary in order to ensure productivity while reducing the use of chemicals bregaglio et al 2013 in the context of global warming there is also a need to understand how pest species dynamics will evolve in the future in this context phenological models are interesting tools to monitor populations dynamics and to predict their evolution e g under changing environmental and climatic conditions steinbauer et al 2004 nietschke et al 2007 stoeckli et al 2012 such models are capable of anticipating insects voltinism and allows improving treatment periods moravie et al 2006 process based models aim to represent biological processes through equations that describe developmental survival fecundity or mortality rates for different life stages of insects from prediapause to overwintering among the different processes simulated phenology development is probably one of the most important because it defines the biological cycle chuine et al 2013 insects are ectotherms and consequently their physiological development is mainly driven by temperature zhou et al 1995 bale et al 2002 tobin et al 2008 they exhibit a response to thermal variation singer and parmesan 2010 bale and hayward 2010 brodeur et al 2013 moiroux et al 2014 by adjusting life history traits like the date of overwintering and population growth hance et al 2007 moreau et al 2017 diapause and overwintering are further determined by photoperiod pavan et al 2006 svobodová et al 2014 both temperature and photoperiod thus explain how insects life cycle respond to local climatic conditions latitude and altitude honĕk 1996 ioriatti et al 2011 changes in the growing rate and geographical distribution of pests have already been observed in the last decades baumgärtner et al 2012 as a consequence of recent changes in climate among the numerous species that affect agriculture lobesia botrana den schiff commonly named the european grapevine moth is a good candidate for assessing effects of climate change on the development of insect pests it is a major grapevine insect pest that is present worldwide including europe as a multivoltine species this pest is able to complete from two in northern parts of europe to four in southern parts of europe generations per year according to climate and latitude martín vertedor et al 2010 under warmer conditions it has the potential of generating more damage than currently as its development will begin earlier in the season and last longer castex et al 2017 marchesini and monta 2004 the life cycle of l botrana is characterized by its capacity to enter into diapause at the pupal phase when day length is less than 14 h 12 h is the limit for pupal overwintering the individuals will overwinter as pupa and start developing before becoming adults and mate to start their adult life and reproduction cycle thiery 2008 many models have been developed to monitor the adult flights of l botrana table 1 they all can be considered as process based models despite using different temperature response functions caffarra et al 2012 caffarelli and vita 1988 gabel and mocko 1984 gallardo et al 2009 logan et al 1976 milonas et al 2001 touzeau 1981 other models adopt a statistical approach to represent biological responses to temperature moravie et al 2006 existing models for l botrana target different purposes some of them describe the growing length at different developmental phases touzeau 1981 gabel and mocko 1984 caffarelli and vita 1988 briere and pracros 1998 1999 severini et al 2005 others focus on the timing of maximum moth flight moravie et al 2006 amo salas et al 2011 ortega lópez et al 2014 forecast the emergence timing arca et al 1993 milonas et al 2001 and population size gallardo et al 2009 the number of generations occurring before diapause caffarra et al 2012 or model the overwintering process baumgärtner et al 2012 finally very complex models such as that of gutierrez et al 2012 try to simulate various processes simultaneously grapevine phenology adult development survival and fecundity rates irrespective of type structure and complexity most of the models given in table 1 were developed to a operate at the local scale implying that they require local sets of parameters e g trentino italian alps in caffarra and eccel 2011 and b to account for possible differences in thermal requirements between different generations meaning that parameters are usually specified for each generation separately touzeau 1981 gabel and mocko 1984 caffarelli and vita 1988 milonas et al 2001 gallardo et al 2009 caffarra et al 2012 for this reason some authors have already highlighted the difficulty of using and comparing these models within a larger range of climatic conditions than initially targeted flores and azin 2015 allen 1976 gallardo et al 2009 amo salas et al 2011 in fact a major downside with local models is that they need local adjustments when applied outside the geographic area targeted in first place to the best of our knowledge only a few models such as the one developed by baumgärtner et al 2012 or ortega lópez et al 2014 have been applied to large geographical scales the overall purpose of this work is to present a generic model for l botrana hereafter called lobesia generic model or lgm that considers a large scale of application and a single response to temperature or thermal time requirements for all generations table 1 the model is built by assembling existing model components and calibrated in such a way as to obtain a generic set of parameters model development and calibration were carried out using pmp a user friendly software providing an interface for designing setting up testing and running phenological models chuine et al 2013 the specific aims of this study are 1 to analyze existing models of l botrana voltinism in order to propose a generic approach for simulating representative phase of development 10 and 50 of the male flights of an adult population from diapause to last flight and 2 to propose a validated standard set of parameters for applications at the large scale we use for this purpose a large database of flight observations compiled in a wide latitudinal transect running from southern spain to northern france fig 1 and representing mediterranean and continental climate types jongman et al 2006 beck et al 2018 2 materials and methods 2 1 data used in the study 2 1 1 phenological data of l botrana the observed data of l botrana correspond to the number of individuals captured per week by pheromone sexual confusion delta traps placed at the beginning of march traps are changed and counted weekly to represent the distribution of population from the first flight of the first generation who overwintered to the last adult flight of the last generation traps are considered one of the best way to capture and represent male flight activity milonas et al 2001 gallardo et al 2009 ortega lópez et al 2014 data were provided by private sector enterprises inter professional councils in the agronomical and viticulture sectors and academic institutions table 2 as illustrated in the map fig 1 12 sites were used to cover latitudes between lat 36 710 n and lat 48 213 n and an altitude range from 0 m a s l saint gilles france and 692 m a s l requena spain we have assumed that it was possible to combine all the data from different sites to calibrate and evaluate the model even if there is no standardized protocol for the observation of adult flights in trap catches of the initially 90 records 51 records of non consecutive observations of l botrana adult flight entire cycle of generations on an annual basis table 2 were retained after quality control from those annual male flights we identified two main phenological observations the 10 and 50 of the total adult flights per generation as done in gallardo et al 2009 to do so we identified and separated the generations of adults as explained in esm1 electronic supplementary material then we calculated the cumulated sum of the number of individuals caught in the traps for each generation g1 g2 g3 g4 from this sum we took the 10 and 50 of the cumulated sum per generation g1 10 g1 50 g2 10 g2 50 etc this data was then related to its corresponding day of year doy of observation the observed data are not continuous in time from 1997 to 2016 because observations are not made systematically also we only used the observed data when we could clearly identify the beginning the peak and the end of the generations that represent around 70 of all the data we collected 2 1 2 meteorological data meteorological data were obtained from different meteorological services at each site table 2 daily minimum maximum and mean temperatures were collected from meteorological stations in an array with a maximum distance of 10 15 km from the collection sites of l botrana flights and almost at the same altitude as the vineyards which we considered reasonable for the representation of local meteorological conditions 2 2 a generic phenological model for l botrana 2 2 1 general description of the model the lgm is a combination of two submodels allowing the simulation of at least five phases of development representing two development stages fig 2 1 the overwintering submodel it considers three phases prediapause diapause and post diapause from the year n 1 to n 2 the male adult flights submodel reproduce the 10 and 50 of the total of the population of each generation for the year n at least two generations can be reproduced with an option for additional generations depending on local climatic conditions and latitude phase is a specific part in a physiological development process e g in the overwintering stage we identify the prediapause phase baumgärtner et al 2012 propose a complex model to simulate the overwintering stage and the adult development at different phases considering the speed of growth in this study we will only consider the first cohort i e the emergence of the first individuals of each generation corresponding to our 10 of flight in fig 2 considering the accumulation of thermal time the overwintering of l botrana is simulated following baumgärtner et al 2012 and gutierrez et al 2012 i e considering three phases 1 prediapause development depend on temperature 2 diapause development depend on a combination of temperature and photoperiod 3 post diapause development depend on temperature the adults flights consider two or more adults generations and depend on temperature and local climatic conditions we propose to simulate the 10 and 50 of the total of the population of each generation the calculation considers the adults that enter into diapause in the previous year n 1 we apply the following equation to describe the temperature effect eq 1 1 f s t d d 0 d s f t d where td is the daily temperature f is the function describing the temperature response described later d0 is the first date of the developmental phase ds the day of the end of the developmental phase and fs td represents the cumulated temperatures forcing units according to baumgärtner et al 2012 d0 first date of the developmental phase depends on the latitude and the photoperiod the analysis of the equations and the parameters proposed by baumgärtner et al 2012 to simulate the end of diapause allowed us to propose a simplification of the original equations described in esm2 using daily values and considering a photoperiod threshold set at 12 h to stop the development of the last generation the final proposed equations can be described as following 2 f t d d 0 d s f t d g p d o r f t d d 0 d s f t d g p d 3 where g p t d 0 p d p l o w p h i g h p l o w 1 p d p l o w p l o w p d p h i g h where td f d0 ds and fs td represent the same variables and parameters as in eq 1 and g is the function describing the photoperiod response and pd is the daily photoperiod the photoperiod function is varying between a low and a high threshold plow and phigh respectively we explored two possibilities of combination of the temperature and photoperiod effect the multiplicative usually used in other models as wang and engel 1998 or the additive as proposed by baumgärtner et al 2012 2 2 2 temperature response functions we tested three different functions to describe the response of l botrana development to temperature fig 3 1 the richardson model r richardson et al 1974 is a step function that assumes a linear response of development to daily temperatures for temperatures in the range tlow to thigh 4 f t d 0 t d t l o w t h i g h t l o w t d t l o w t l o w t d t h i g h t d t h i g h such approaches have been used by arca et al 1993 to calculate the emergence of adults and larvae of l botrana 1 the triangular model t hänninen 1990 assumes a linear positive response to daily temperatures for td in the range tmin to topt and an linear but negative response for td in the range topt to tmax maiorano et al 2012 5 f t d 0 t d t m i n t o p t t m i n t d t m a x t o p t t m a x 0 t d t m i n t m i n t d t o p t t o p t t d t m a x t d t

the temperature wang and engel 1998 and have been applied by milonas et al 2001 briere and pracros 1998 logan et al 1976 and baumgärtner et al 2012 for l botrana 2 2 3 modelling parameterization and evaluation framework 2 2 3 1 overwintering submodel we assume that the overwintering starts dt0 when day length is more than 12 h roditakis and karandinos 2001 baumgärtner et al 2012 individuals that enter into prediapause in the year n autumn will overwinter spring in the following year diapause induction starts when the day length falls below 14 h with a critical threshold at 12 h fig 2 according to this assumption and eqs 1 3 of baumgärtner et al 2012 it is possible to define when the first cohort begins its diapause the diapause is a combination of temperature and photoperiod the doy of diapause induction was evaluated according to eq 3 in baumgärtner et al 2012 calculating the day length as a function of the doy and the latitude in spite of the fact that eq 3 predicts a critical day length threshold increasing linearly with latitude the doy allowing diapause induction does not vary significantly with latitude ranging from doy 183 to doy 193 across our sites for this reason we tested the sensibility of the model to different starting date dt0 july 1st for the southernest site and the july 15th as an average date for all the sites the post diapause depends on temperature to allow the emergence of the first generation of adults the cumulation of thermal accumulation from the prediapause to the post diapause determines the first adult flights this first sub model overwintering was necessary to determine the start of the calculation of the 10 of flight of the adults from the 1st generation g1 10 2 2 3 2 submodel for the adults flights in order to simulate the 10 and the 50 of each generation we made the three following assumptions 1 eggs laid by g1 10 or g1 50 adult will reach the adult stage at g2 10 or g2 50 and this hypothesis is valid for all the following generations gn 10 or gn 50 2 the same functions and set of parameters can be used to simulate the thermal time accumulation between g1 10 and g2 10 or g n 1 10 and gn 10 g n 1 50 and gn 50 as well as gn 10 and gn 50 3 the same set of parameters can be used for all sites and generations without significant repercussions on the quality of the simulations if compared to results obtained with site specific parameters parker et al 2011 we calibrated and tested the three models richardson r triangle t and wang w for the 10 10 and 50 50 of adult flights between the generations and the 10 50 of adult flights within the generation itself preliminary simulations were made with all parameters called allp meaning that the model calculates alone without any restriction of parameters esm8 at the same time we also tested different sets of parameters tmin 0 c 5 c 7 c tmax 28 c 33 c gutierrez s et al 2012 parameters tmin 8 9 c topt 30 8 c and tmax 33 c and some baumgärtner s et al 2012 parameters tmin 4 5 c esm6 7 and 8 2 2 4 calibration of the model for the purpose of calibration and testing we split the original data into a calibration dataset 75 of the total sample selected randomly cal dataset and a validation dataset 25 of the data val dataset picard and cook 1984 the calibration of the parameters for the overwintering stage and the adult generations were made separately once the models and parameters were determined we joined the two submodels to run the simulations with our calibration data set and validate it with the validation dataset finally in order to provide the best set of parameters we recalibrated the entire model using all the database all dataset using a cross validation method cleland et al 2007 the best parameters were selected according to the results of the statistical criteria described in table 3 the performance criteria were defined using the variance global of the observed data stot the sum of squares residuals sres the root mean square error rmse the efficiency of the model eff and the akaike test aic for more details on the description and the formulas see the esm3 and 8 2 2 5 software to facilitate the development and the parameterization of this phenological model the pmp software phenology modelling platform pmp 5 5 has been used downloaded from http www cefe cnrs fr en logiciels ressources documentaires pmp allows constructing fitting and running simulations of a phenological model using meteorological data and phenological observations chuine et al 2013 3 results in this section we describe the results obtained from the calibration and the validation of both sub models 1 the first sub model describing the overwintering period 2 the second sub model which simulates the 10 10 50 50 and 10 50 of the different generations of adults 3 1 overwintering submodel 3 1 1 model three phases testing r t and w models with cal val and all data set as described previously we tested different versions of the submodel for the three phases of overwintering fig 2 1 different functions for temperature responses r t w 2 different starting dates of prediapause dt0 july 1st and july 15th 3 different ways to combine temperature t and photoperiod p responses during the diapause period using an additive sum and multiplicative mult factor the best models obtained used the t and w functions starting on 15th july dt0 and multiplying the temperature and photoperiod effects table 3 describes only results obtained with cal data set with a start date dt0 on july 15th and using a multiplicative mult method for combining photoperiod and temperature for further results concerning all dates and methods see esm4 the best results were obtained with the triangle and wang approaches showing eff values of 0 77 and 0 74 respectively table 3 the combination method of the functions had more impact on the results than the starting dates named dt0 moreover the date of entry in prediapause was coherent with baumgärnter s values baumgärtner et al 2012 to evaluate parameter sensitivity we compare the two best models models 1 and 2 in table 4 with various models using the same functions but fixing some of their parameters from the literature table 4 because tmin and topt values for the post diapause phase were close to one another we explored the impact of fixing tmin value to 4 5 c according to baumgärtner et al 2012 keeping all the other parameters from the best models results obtained for both models models 3 and 4 in table 4 show that this parameter does not degrade the quality substantially values of efficiency of 0 67 0 69 in order to explore other values of parameters from the literature we tested gutierrez et al 2012 parameters gut parameters are tmin 8 9 c topt 30 8 c and tmax 33 c for all the temperature thresholds with free day length dl and limiting the post diapause with baum tmin 4 5 c models 5 and 6 in table 4 and with the tmin free for the post diapause phase models 7 and 8 in table 4 results obtained show that these parameters combination decrease significantly the quality of the model having a higher effect when using the w function in order to provide the best set of parameters we validated the defined best models t and w using the validation val data set table 5 in contrast to cal 39 data points the validation data val include only 12 randomly chosen observations for this reason apart for a low value of eff 0 1 and 0 08 the performance statistics for val are more than satisfactory with rmse 8 99 and aic 52 7 after a first screening the different model configurations we calibrated t and w using all available data dataset all for both response functions eff 0 5 0 59 for t 0 70 for w respectively satisfactory were also the values of the rmse 8 68 for t and 7 47 for w respectively fig 4 we also selected w to simulate the first flight in our model as it seems to be the more stable with all the simulations made with fixed or free parameterization 3 2 submodel for the adults flights we again tested different temperature response functions r w t to evaluate their performance to simulate adult flights between two consecutive generations 10 10 50 50 and within a generation itself 10 50 following the same methodology as for the first flight simulations were carried out by specifying all the parameters as free parameters to be calibrated or fixing some of them at values obtained from the literature summary statistics are presented in table 6 3 2 1 simulation the 10 10 50 50 between the generations according to the first assumption described in the modelling framework see material and methods section we explore the capacity of the model to represent with a single set of parameters all the 10 10 and 50 50 generations the three models in table 6 had high values of eff when all the parameters are fitted around 0 95 values of the eff decreased when some of the parameters were fixed values varying between 0 25 to 0 95 depending on the model we also validated the best model allp model with the independent val dataset and we obtained good efficiency values for all the models eff 0 84 as for the overwintering model we propose to exclude r from our analysis because its structure to describe the development of l botrana does not integrate maximum temperature tmax even if the calibration did not show a significant effect of this threshold moreover as in the overwintering model the test using gutierrez s parameters did not improve the simulation even if we obtained better results than with the overwintering models finally the w function with tmin 2 4 c topt 23 12 c and tmax 32 13 c was the best one with free parameters see esm7 and the closer to the known biological behaviour of l botrana according to the literature indeed we also explored the sensitivity of each group 10 10 and 50 50 separately and comparing the values of these parameters to the previously obtained this analysis allowed evaluating their robustness to simulate each phase independently table 7 results obtained in table 7 show that the models simulate correctly the 10 10 and the 50 50 generations when we consider parameters from the first calibration table 6 and with all parameters free but separating 10 10 and 50 50 in different datasets for parameters values see in esm3 the eff was around 0 92 and 0 94 and the rmse between 7 and 8 days for the three functions r t and w indeed when using gutierrez s parameters the r and t models showed good results eff 0 92 which was not the case for the w model that degraded eff 0 21 and 0 26 this analysis confirms the robustness of the model and its parameters allowing to use a single function to simulate all the generations of one cycle for the 10 to 10 and 50 to 50 values for each generation 3 2 2 simulation 10 50 of adults flights within a generation itself as previously reported fig 2 results presented in the following refer to simulations with no difference in parameter values between different generations results described in table 8 show that very high values of eff from 0 98 to 0 99 were obtained irrespective of the model configuration fixing parameters for the w model to the values suggested by gutierrez et al 2012 significantly degraded the results eff 0 05 in line with the previous tests the sensitivity of these models have been tested fixing some parameters tlow tmin and tmax in esm5 and 6 all the parameters found are close to the ones known in the literature so we kept them fixed tmin 8 9 c topt 30 8 c and tmax 33 c in gut or tmin 4 5 c in baumgärtner et al 2012 in the first simulations with cal data set and using free parameters all parameters free w seems to achieve better performances than t and r indeed with fixed parameters the results did not improve with an rmse around 5 5 days for the 3 functions and with parameters whose values are close to those found in the literature we also validated the best model all parameters free model with the independent val dataset and we obtained good efficiency values for all the models eff 0 96 and an error of 9 84 days rmse fig 5 illustrates the distribution of the simulated and observed data for the 10 50 of male flights within the same generation for the wang model the figure shows the good capacity of the model to simulate this phase in general fig 6 the box size is proportional to the number of data and shows that the error for the simulation of all the generations for all the transect study have a small error mean of 5 days between simulated and observed data 4 general discussion of the results this study examined the possibility to assemble a simple robust generic yet process based model for simulating the voltinism of l botrana this model can be useful for large scale studies and impact studies targeting the behaviour of the insect pests under future climate change the analysis of existing model indicated that two phases overwintering and adults are necessary to realistically represent the life cycle of l botrana the methodology to calculate the voltinism was based on the 10 and 50 of the total male flights per generation as significant reference to make simulations data used for model development and testing were obtained from a wide latitudinal transect allowing to test the possibility to apply the model at large scales the parameterization of the model was made by analysing different published models table 1 three types of temperature response functions were examined richardson triangle and wang the evaluation results showed that t and w are very close in their performance the analysis provided good results with or without the use of certain specific parameter values found in the literature moreover the sensitivity of the models to different sets of parameters from the literature used by baumgärtner et al 2012 and gutierrez et al 2012 did not improved the results of the parameterization tests with free parameters allp on the contrary the tests made with the gutierrez s parameters degraded the results table 8 another issue raised in our study was to integrate the photoperiod in a large latitudinal transect from lat 36 710 n to lat 48 213 n and understand its interaction with temperatures as multiplicative or additive factor the analysis of this interaction table 3 and 4 showed that the multiplicative approach was better adapted to describe these interactions than the additive approach proposed by baumgärtner et al 2012 esm2 in any case the multiplicative approach is the one commonly implemented in complex models and usually performs accurately briere and pracros 1998 wang and engel 1998 baumgärtner et al 2012 finally the analysis also indicated that assuming a common diapause starting date dt0 july 15th for the entire transect was a reasonable choice we show that lgm is able to correctly represent the life cycle of l botrana in various areas with the same set of parameters with a model performance comparable to the one of local models parker et al 2011 this model is based on existing models but applied at other scale and consider less parameters that make its use easier this approach is different to the previous one as it can be applied for large scale studies like climate change scenarios 4 1 proposal for a new model the lgm uses a simplification of baumgärtner s approach only to calculate the first cohort and not the entire population of l botrana as in the original function the overwintering submodel considers the general approach of the sum of temperatures i e cumulation of temperatures as gdd or growing degree days and not the speed of growing as in baumgärtner s original function then the adults submodel uses the same parameters to cumulate heat between and within the generations as we describe in the fig 7 the lgm model and baumgärtner s model have the same range of errors to simulate the first cohort of a l botrana population even with a simplification of the calculation methods this comparison between both models provided a second partial validation of the lgm model because it is not exhaustive as the years observations and sites latitude are different in both studies in the lgm the results of the different tests showed similar performances for all models and developmental phases studied we nevertheless propose to use the w model to simulate different temperature responses because it better reflects the known biological response of l botrana to temperature thus wang is the unique function used to simulate both overwintering predia dia and post dia and adult flights submodels this is a classical approach using a first model with the calibration and validation data sets a preliminary analysis revealed that the small divergence between the models allowed us to test another model with all the data sets table 9 provides the statistical analysis with all the parameter values used for the calibration validation and the entire data set it summarizes the proposed model lgm model showing the different parameter sets used to simulate the three phases of the overwintering period but the single common set of parameters used to simulate all the phases 10 and 50 of the different generations of the adults flights concerning the adult development stage the results confirm our hypothesis that a standard set of parameters is sufficient to accurately simulate the voltinism of l botrana from diapause to last flight in terms of the 10 and 50 of the male flights this finding is important because as we described in the introduction it is common practice to recalibrate phenological models for each generation beddow et al 2010 thus in previous studies table 1 authors proposed a different set of parameters or models for each generation considering that the biological response was different during the entire cycle we are convinced that our approach introduces more robustness into the simulation of the life cycle of l botrana indeed it allows applications at large geographical scales without adapting the model to local parameters whether this can also be extended to other species remains to be investigated 4 2 advantages and limits of the generic model to define the lgm we considered the models with the best statistical criteria and the most representative biological processes known from the literature esm7 one of the major difficulties we encountered was to model the overwintering phase as we did not dispose of data to represent the associated intermediate phases i e end of prediapause and end of diapause the calibration of this complex submodel was hence performed targeting the date of the 10 of the first generation at each site the lack of intermediate information is a common problem faced in developing phenology models for plants chuine et al 2016 in our case the data collection have been a long process and the quality selection of the male flights had to correspond to sites where we had meteorological data available close by at least 15 years some authors like amo salas et al 2011 and armendáriz et al 2009 integrated relative humidity in their model but they concluded that the value error with or without this parameter was not a significant influencing factor indeed we did not consider relative humidity as in baumgärtner et al 2012 as we did not have such data available for all our sites another limit of this study concerns the data that have been selected and converted to a comparable and standardized unit but the observed data do not consider a protocol and the heterogeneity of the observed data can alter the quality of the calibration observation values obtained in the laboratory in controlled conditions at constant temperature where rates of development are estimated approximately briere and pracros 1999 torres vila et al 1999 picart 2009 can differ considerably from those observed in the field and between the sites or by calibrating models using local conditions arca et al 1993 torres vila et al 1999 severini et al 2005 moravie et al 2006 the large latitudinal range of study is complex as seen in fig 5 where some extreme values representing the 4th generations in south of spain not present at other sites fall for the cal dataset and not in the val dataset due to the randomization of the data selection and can alter the eff of the tests nevertheless the strength of this study has been to obtain a stable and robust model at a large spatial scale we believe that this work has contributed to raise new questions on scale applications for applied studies like climate change and on the methodologies used to simulate insect developmental processes the approach developed here making use of a simple and unique set of parameters representative of the biological response to temperatures has shown very interesting and encouraging results 4 3 future model applications we anticipate that lgm as a model is appropriate to conduct impact studies that integrate climate change scenarios in order to predict the future geographical distribution of ectothermic insects and the future extent of vulnerable areas multivoltine species are likely to develop more generations under warmer conditions caffarra et al 2012 reineke and thiery 2016 sensitivity analyses with lgm combined with phenological models for plants as grapevine for example will allow to identify critical shifts in the synchrony or asynchrony of different trophic levels host plants and insect pests and the ensuing overlap periods hoover and newman 2004 hirschi et al 2012 stoeckli et al 2012 gilioli et al 2016 nevertheless more data would have been useful to validate the choice of the best models this study could be improved by testing other regions of the world or by implementing the entire set of data used in concert with phenological models for crops lgm will help raise the awareness of producers on the emergence of new threats and adaptation of future treatment practices according to geographic areas again the advantages of lgm are its conceptual simplicity and generic parameterization which allow the implementation of climate change studies at the large scale for both plants and insect pests author contribution statement vc and igca conceived and designed the research and analyzed the data pc and jm contributed

24889,the physiological development of insect pests is driven by temperature and photoperiod geographic variations in the speed of growth reflect current patterns in thermal conditions as a function of latitude and altitude global warming will likely lead to shifts in pests phenology insects are expected to overwinter earlier and develop more generations with implications for the risks of damage to agricultural crops understanding and monitoring of the voltinism of insect pests will be increasingly important to anticipate critical phases of pest development and devise options for adapting pest control measures in this study we describe a new generic phenological model that allows to reproduce the voltinism of lobesia botrana a major insect pest that affect grapevine production vitis vinifera l worldwide inspired by existing models the lobesia generic model lgm combines two submodels representing the overwintering period and the dates of flight of subsequent generations of male insects this model uses a unique beta function for representing the temperature responses of both the overwintering generation as well as the adult generations the results indicate that lgm is able to simulate l botrana voltinism under climatic conditions ranging from those observed in southern spain to those recorded in the alsace region france the lgm only requires a single set of parameters valid for all the generations with a precision of around 7 days rmse allowing a simple use with parameters representative of natural behaviour and found in the existing literature keywords generic phenological modelling lobesia botrana voltinism process based model temperature photoperiod 1 introduction modern agriculture relies on the massive use of pesticides to increase productivity tilman et al 2002 this has caused considerable stress on biodiversity and made insect pests more resistant to pesticides hatt et al 2018 furthermore extensive commercial trade as well as increasing temperatures have enhanced the spread of insect pests as a result invasive species have started to damage crops in remote areas bale et al 2002 lin 2011 lamichhane et al 2015 understanding and predicting insect pest dynamics is necessary in order to ensure productivity while reducing the use of chemicals bregaglio et al 2013 in the context of global warming there is also a need to understand how pest species dynamics will evolve in the future in this context phenological models are interesting tools to monitor populations dynamics and to predict their evolution e g under changing environmental and climatic conditions steinbauer et al 2004 nietschke et al 2007 stoeckli et al 2012 such models are capable of anticipating insects voltinism and allows improving treatment periods moravie et al 2006 process based models aim to represent biological processes through equations that describe developmental survival fecundity or mortality rates for different life stages of insects from prediapause to overwintering among the different processes simulated phenology development is probably one of the most important because it defines the biological cycle chuine et al 2013 insects are ectotherms and consequently their physiological development is mainly driven by temperature zhou et al 1995 bale et al 2002 tobin et al 2008 they exhibit a response to thermal variation singer and parmesan 2010 bale and hayward 2010 brodeur et al 2013 moiroux et al 2014 by adjusting life history traits like the date of overwintering and population growth hance et al 2007 moreau et al 2017 diapause and overwintering are further determined by photoperiod pavan et al 2006 svobodová et al 2014 both temperature and photoperiod thus explain how insects life cycle respond to local climatic conditions latitude and altitude honĕk 1996 ioriatti et al 2011 changes in the growing rate and geographical distribution of pests have already been observed in the last decades baumgärtner et al 2012 as a consequence of recent changes in climate among the numerous species that affect agriculture lobesia botrana den schiff commonly named the european grapevine moth is a good candidate for assessing effects of climate change on the development of insect pests it is a major grapevine insect pest that is present worldwide including europe as a multivoltine species this pest is able to complete from two in northern parts of europe to four in southern parts of europe generations per year according to climate and latitude martín vertedor et al 2010 under warmer conditions it has the potential of generating more damage than currently as its development will begin earlier in the season and last longer castex et al 2017 marchesini and monta 2004 the life cycle of l botrana is characterized by its capacity to enter into diapause at the pupal phase when day length is less than 14 h 12 h is the limit for pupal overwintering the individuals will overwinter as pupa and start developing before becoming adults and mate to start their adult life and reproduction cycle thiery 2008 many models have been developed to monitor the adult flights of l botrana table 1 they all can be considered as process based models despite using different temperature response functions caffarra et al 2012 caffarelli and vita 1988 gabel and mocko 1984 gallardo et al 2009 logan et al 1976 milonas et al 2001 touzeau 1981 other models adopt a statistical approach to represent biological responses to temperature moravie et al 2006 existing models for l botrana target different purposes some of them describe the growing length at different developmental phases touzeau 1981 gabel and mocko 1984 caffarelli and vita 1988 briere and pracros 1998 1999 severini et al 2005 others focus on the timing of maximum moth flight moravie et al 2006 amo salas et al 2011 ortega lópez et al 2014 forecast the emergence timing arca et al 1993 milonas et al 2001 and population size gallardo et al 2009 the number of generations occurring before diapause caffarra et al 2012 or model the overwintering process baumgärtner et al 2012 finally very complex models such as that of gutierrez et al 2012 try to simulate various processes simultaneously grapevine phenology adult development survival and fecundity rates irrespective of type structure and complexity most of the models given in table 1 were developed to a operate at the local scale implying that they require local sets of parameters e g trentino italian alps in caffarra and eccel 2011 and b to account for possible differences in thermal requirements between different generations meaning that parameters are usually specified for each generation separately touzeau 1981 gabel and mocko 1984 caffarelli and vita 1988 milonas et al 2001 gallardo et al 2009 caffarra et al 2012 for this reason some authors have already highlighted the difficulty of using and comparing these models within a larger range of climatic conditions than initially targeted flores and azin 2015 allen 1976 gallardo et al 2009 amo salas et al 2011 in fact a major downside with local models is that they need local adjustments when applied outside the geographic area targeted in first place to the best of our knowledge only a few models such as the one developed by baumgärtner et al 2012 or ortega lópez et al 2014 have been applied to large geographical scales the overall purpose of this work is to present a generic model for l botrana hereafter called lobesia generic model or lgm that considers a large scale of application and a single response to temperature or thermal time requirements for all generations table 1 the model is built by assembling existing model components and calibrated in such a way as to obtain a generic set of parameters model development and calibration were carried out using pmp a user friendly software providing an interface for designing setting up testing and running phenological models chuine et al 2013 the specific aims of this study are 1 to analyze existing models of l botrana voltinism in order to propose a generic approach for simulating representative phase of development 10 and 50 of the male flights of an adult population from diapause to last flight and 2 to propose a validated standard set of parameters for applications at the large scale we use for this purpose a large database of flight observations compiled in a wide latitudinal transect running from southern spain to northern france fig 1 and representing mediterranean and continental climate types jongman et al 2006 beck et al 2018 2 materials and methods 2 1 data used in the study 2 1 1 phenological data of l botrana the observed data of l botrana correspond to the number of individuals captured per week by pheromone sexual confusion delta traps placed at the beginning of march traps are changed and counted weekly to represent the distribution of population from the first flight of the first generation who overwintered to the last adult flight of the last generation traps are considered one of the best way to capture and represent male flight activity milonas et al 2001 gallardo et al 2009 ortega lópez et al 2014 data were provided by private sector enterprises inter professional councils in the agronomical and viticulture sectors and academic institutions table 2 as illustrated in the map fig 1 12 sites were used to cover latitudes between lat 36 710 n and lat 48 213 n and an altitude range from 0 m a s l saint gilles france and 692 m a s l requena spain we have assumed that it was possible to combine all the data from different sites to calibrate and evaluate the model even if there is no standardized protocol for the observation of adult flights in trap catches of the initially 90 records 51 records of non consecutive observations of l botrana adult flight entire cycle of generations on an annual basis table 2 were retained after quality control from those annual male flights we identified two main phenological observations the 10 and 50 of the total adult flights per generation as done in gallardo et al 2009 to do so we identified and separated the generations of adults as explained in esm1 electronic supplementary material then we calculated the cumulated sum of the number of individuals caught in the traps for each generation g1 g2 g3 g4 from this sum we took the 10 and 50 of the cumulated sum per generation g1 10 g1 50 g2 10 g2 50 etc this data was then related to its corresponding day of year doy of observation the observed data are not continuous in time from 1997 to 2016 because observations are not made systematically also we only used the observed data when we could clearly identify the beginning the peak and the end of the generations that represent around 70 of all the data we collected 2 1 2 meteorological data meteorological data were obtained from different meteorological services at each site table 2 daily minimum maximum and mean temperatures were collected from meteorological stations in an array with a maximum distance of 10 15 km from the collection sites of l botrana flights and almost at the same altitude as the vineyards which we considered reasonable for the representation of local meteorological conditions 2 2 a generic phenological model for l botrana 2 2 1 general description of the model the lgm is a combination of two submodels allowing the simulation of at least five phases of development representing two development stages fig 2 1 the overwintering submodel it considers three phases prediapause diapause and post diapause from the year n 1 to n 2 the male adult flights submodel reproduce the 10 and 50 of the total of the population of each generation for the year n at least two generations can be reproduced with an option for additional generations depending on local climatic conditions and latitude phase is a specific part in a physiological development process e g in the overwintering stage we identify the prediapause phase baumgärtner et al 2012 propose a complex model to simulate the overwintering stage and the adult development at different phases considering the speed of growth in this study we will only consider the first cohort i e the emergence of the first individuals of each generation corresponding to our 10 of flight in fig 2 considering the accumulation of thermal time the overwintering of l botrana is simulated following baumgärtner et al 2012 and gutierrez et al 2012 i e considering three phases 1 prediapause development depend on temperature 2 diapause development depend on a combination of temperature and photoperiod 3 post diapause development depend on temperature the adults flights consider two or more adults generations and depend on temperature and local climatic conditions we propose to simulate the 10 and 50 of the total of the population of each generation the calculation considers the adults that enter into diapause in the previous year n 1 we apply the following equation to describe the temperature effect eq 1 1 f s t d d 0 d s f t d where td is the daily temperature f is the function describing the temperature response described later d0 is the first date of the developmental phase ds the day of the end of the developmental phase and fs td represents the cumulated temperatures forcing units according to baumgärtner et al 2012 d0 first date of the developmental phase depends on the latitude and the photoperiod the analysis of the equations and the parameters proposed by baumgärtner et al 2012 to simulate the end of diapause allowed us to propose a simplification of the original equations described in esm2 using daily values and considering a photoperiod threshold set at 12 h to stop the development of the last generation the final proposed equations can be described as following 2 f t d d 0 d s f t d g p d o r f t d d 0 d s f t d g p d 3 where g p t d 0 p d p l o w p h i g h p l o w 1 p d p l o w p l o w p d p h i g h where td f d0 ds and fs td represent the same variables and parameters as in eq 1 and g is the function describing the photoperiod response and pd is the daily photoperiod the photoperiod function is varying between a low and a high threshold plow and phigh respectively we explored two possibilities of combination of the temperature and photoperiod effect the multiplicative usually used in other models as wang and engel 1998 or the additive as proposed by baumgärtner et al 2012 2 2 2 temperature response functions we tested three different functions to describe the response of l botrana development to temperature fig 3 1 the richardson model r richardson et al 1974 is a step function that assumes a linear response of development to daily temperatures for temperatures in the range tlow to thigh 4 f t d 0 t d t l o w t h i g h t l o w t d t l o w t l o w t d t h i g h t d t h i g h such approaches have been used by arca et al 1993 to calculate the emergence of adults and larvae of l botrana 1 the triangular model t hänninen 1990 assumes a linear positive response to daily temperatures for td in the range tmin to topt and an linear but negative response for td in the range topt to tmax maiorano et al 2012 5 f t d 0 t d t m i n t o p t t m i n t d t m a x t o p t t m a x 0 t d t m i n t m i n t d t o p t t o p t t d t m a x t d t

the temperature wang and engel 1998 and have been applied by milonas et al 2001 briere and pracros 1998 logan et al 1976 and baumgärtner et al 2012 for l botrana 2 2 3 modelling parameterization and evaluation framework 2 2 3 1 overwintering submodel we assume that the overwintering starts dt0 when day length is more than 12 h roditakis and karandinos 2001 baumgärtner et al 2012 individuals that enter into prediapause in the year n autumn will overwinter spring in the following year diapause induction starts when the day length falls below 14 h with a critical threshold at 12 h fig 2 according to this assumption and eqs 1 3 of baumgärtner et al 2012 it is possible to define when the first cohort begins its diapause the diapause is a combination of temperature and photoperiod the doy of diapause induction was evaluated according to eq 3 in baumgärtner et al 2012 calculating the day length as a function of the doy and the latitude in spite of the fact that eq 3 predicts a critical day length threshold increasing linearly with latitude the doy allowing diapause induction does not vary significantly with latitude ranging from doy 183 to doy 193 across our sites for this reason we tested the sensibility of the model to different starting date dt0 july 1st for the southernest site and the july 15th as an average date for all the sites the post diapause depends on temperature to allow the emergence of the first generation of adults the cumulation of thermal accumulation from the prediapause to the post diapause determines the first adult flights this first sub model overwintering was necessary to determine the start of the calculation of the 10 of flight of the adults from the 1st generation g1 10 2 2 3 2 submodel for the adults flights in order to simulate the 10 and the 50 of each generation we made the three following assumptions 1 eggs laid by g1 10 or g1 50 adult will reach the adult stage at g2 10 or g2 50 and this hypothesis is valid for all the following generations gn 10 or gn 50 2 the same functions and set of parameters can be used to simulate the thermal time accumulation between g1 10 and g2 10 or g n 1 10 and gn 10 g n 1 50 and gn 50 as well as gn 10 and gn 50 3 the same set of parameters can be used for all sites and generations without significant repercussions on the quality of the simulations if compared to results obtained with site specific parameters parker et al 2011 we calibrated and tested the three models richardson r triangle t and wang w for the 10 10 and 50 50 of adult flights between the generations and the 10 50 of adult flights within the generation itself preliminary simulations were made with all parameters called allp meaning that the model calculates alone without any restriction of parameters esm8 at the same time we also tested different sets of parameters tmin 0 c 5 c 7 c tmax 28 c 33 c gutierrez s et al 2012 parameters tmin 8 9 c topt 30 8 c and tmax 33 c and some baumgärtner s et al 2012 parameters tmin 4 5 c esm6 7 and 8 2 2 4 calibration of the model for the purpose of calibration and testing we split the original data into a calibration dataset 75 of the total sample selected randomly cal dataset and a validation dataset 25 of the data val dataset picard and cook 1984 the calibration of the parameters for the overwintering stage and the adult generations were made separately once the models and parameters were determined we joined the two submodels to run the simulations with our calibration data set and validate it with the validation dataset finally in order to provide the best set of parameters we recalibrated the entire model using all the database all dataset using a cross validation method cleland et al 2007 the best parameters were selected according to the results of the statistical criteria described in table 3 the performance criteria were defined using the variance global of the observed data stot the sum of squares residuals sres the root

different generations of adults 3 1 overwintering submodel 3 1 1 model three phases testing r t and w models with cal val and all data set as described previously we tested different versions of the submodel for the three phases of overwintering fig 2 1 different functions for temperature responses r t w 2 different starting dates of prediapause dt0 july 1st and july 15th 3 different ways to combine temperature t and photoperiod p responses during the diapause period using an additive sum and multiplicative mult factor the best models obtained used the t and w functions starting on 15th july dt0 and multiplying the temperature and photoperiod effects table 3 describes only results obtained with cal data set with a start date dt0 on july 15th and using a multiplicative mult method for combining photoperiod and temperature for further results concerning all dates and methods see esm4 the best results were obtained with the triangle and wang approaches showing eff values of 0 77 and 0 74 respectively table 3 the combination method of the functions had more impact on the results than the starting dates named dt0 moreover the date of entry in prediapause was coherent with baumgärnter s values baumgärtner et al 2012 to evaluate parameter sensitivity we compare the two best models models 1 and 2 in table 4 with various models using the same functions but fixing some of their parameters from the literature table 4 because tmin and topt values for the post diapause phase were close to one another we explored the impact of fixing tmin value to 4 5 c according to baumgärtner et al 2012 keeping all the other parameters from the best models results obtained for both models models 3 and 4 in table 4 show that this parameter does not degrade the quality substantially values of efficiency of 0 67 0 69 in order to explore other values of parameters from the literature we tested gutierrez et al 2012 parameters gut parameters are tmin 8 9 c topt 30 8 c and tmax 33 c for all the temperature thresholds with free day length dl and limiting the post diapause with baum tmin 4 5 c models 5 and 6 in table 4 and with the tmin free for the post diapause phase models 7 and 8 in table 4 results obtained show that these parameters combination decrease significantly the quality of the model having a higher effect when using the w function in order to provide the best set of parameters we validated the defined best models t and w using the validation val data set table 5 in contrast to cal 39 data points the validation data val include only 12 randomly chosen observations for this reason apart for a low value of eff 0 1 and 0 08 the performance statistics for val are more than satisfactory with rmse 8 99 and aic 52 7 after a first screening the different model configurations we calibrated t and w using all available data dataset all for both response functions eff 0 5 0 59 for t 0 70 for w respectively satisfactory were also the values of the rmse 8 68 for t and 7 47 for w respectively fig 4 we also selected w to simulate the first flight in our model as it seems to be the more stable with all the simulations made with fixed or free parameterization 3 2 submodel for the adults flights we again tested different temperature response functions r w t to evaluate their performance to simulate adult flights between two consecutive generations 10 10 50 50 and within a generation itself 10 50 following the same methodology as for the first flight simulations were carried out by specifying all the parameters as free parameters to be calibrated or fixing some of them at values obtained from the literature summary statistics are presented in table 6 3 2 1 simulation the 10 10 50 50 between the generations according to the first assumption described in the modelling framework see material and methods section we explore the capacity of the model to represent with a single set of parameters all the 10 10 and 50 50 generations the three models in table 6 had high values of eff when all the parameters are fitted around 0 95 values of the eff decreased when some of the parameters were fixed values varying between 0 25 to 0 95 depending on the model we also validated the best model allp model with the independent val dataset and we obtained good efficiency values for all the models eff 0 84 as for the overwintering model we propose to exclude r from our analysis because its structure to describe the development of l botrana does not integrate maximum temperature tmax even if the calibration did not show a significant effect of this threshold moreover as in the overwintering model the test using gutierrez s parameters did not improve the simulation even if we obtained better results than with the overwintering models finally the w function with tmin 2 4 c topt 23 12 c and tmax 32 13 c was the best one with free parameters see esm7 and the closer to the known biological behaviour of l botrana according to the literature indeed we also explored the sensitivity of each group 10 10 and 50 50 separately and comparing the values of these parameters to the previously obtained this analysis allowed evaluating their robustness to simulate each phase independently table 7 results obtained in table 7 show that the models simulate correctly the 10 10 and the 50 50 generations when we consider parameters from the first calibration table 6 and with all parameters free but separating 10 10 and 50 50 in different datasets for parameters values see in esm3 the eff was around 0 92 and 0 94 and the rmse between 7 and 8 days for the three functions r t and w indeed when using gutierrez s parameters the r and t models showed good results eff 0 92 which was not the case for the w model that degraded eff 0 21 and 0 26 this analysis confirms the robustness of the model and its parameters allowing to use a single function to simulate all the generations of one cycle for the 10 to 10 and 50 to 50 values for each generation 3 2 2 simulation 10 50 of adults flights within a generation itself as previously reported fig 2 results presented in the following refer to simulations with no difference in parameter values between different generations results described in table 8 show that very high values of eff from 0 98 to 0 99 were obtained irrespective of the model configuration fixing parameters for the w model to the values suggested by gutierrez et al 2012 significantly degraded the results eff 0 05 in line with the previous tests the sensitivity of these models have been tested fixing some parameters tlow tmin and tmax in esm5 and 6 all the parameters found are close to the ones known in the literature so we kept them fixed tmin 8 9 c topt 30 8 c and tmax 33 c in gut or tmin 4 5 c in baumgärtner et al 2012 in the first simulations with cal data set and using free parameters all parameters free w seems to achieve better performances than t and r indeed with fixed parameters the results did not improve with an rmse around 5 5 days for the 3 functions and with parameters whose values are close to those found in the literature we also validated the best model all parameters free model with the independent val dataset and we obtained good efficiency values for all the models eff 0 96 and an error of 9 84 days rmse fig 5 illustrates the distribution of the simulated and observed data for the 10 50 of male flights within the same generation for the wang model the figure shows the good capacity of the model to simulate this phase in general fig 6 the box size is proportional to the number of data and shows that the error for the simulation of all the generations for all the transect study have a small error mean of 5 days between simulated and observed data 4 general discussion of the results this study examined the possibility to assemble a simple robust generic yet process based model for simulating the voltinism of l botrana this model can be useful for large scale studies and impact studies targeting the behaviour of the insect pests under future climate change the analysis of existing model indicated that two phases overwintering and adults are necessary to realistically represent the life cycle of l botrana the methodology to calculate the voltinism was based on the 10 and 50 of the total male flights per generation as significant reference to make simulations data used for model development and testing were obtained from a wide latitudinal transect allowing to test the possibility to apply the model at large scales the parameterization of the model was made by analysing different published models table 1 three types of temperature response functions were examined richardson triangle and wang the evaluation results showed that t and w are very close in their performance the analysis provided good results with or without the use of certain specific parameter values found in the literature moreover the sensitivity of the models to different sets of parameters from the literature used by baumgärtner et al 2012 and gutierrez et al 2012 did not improved the results of the parameterization tests with free parameters allp on the contrary the tests made with the gutierrez s parameters degraded the results table 8 another issue raised in our study was to integrate the photoperiod in a large latitudinal transect from lat 36 710 n to lat 48 213 n and understand its interaction with temperatures as multiplicative or additive factor the analysis of this interaction table 3 and 4 showed that the multiplicative approach was better adapted to describe these interactions than the additive approach proposed by baumgärtner et al 2012 esm2 in any case the multiplicative approach is the one commonly implemented in complex models and usually performs accurately briere and pracros 1998 wang and engel 1998 baumgärtner et al 2012 finally the analysis also indicated that assuming a common diapause starting date dt0 july 15th for the entire transect was a reasonable choice we show that lgm is able to correctly represent the life cycle of l botrana in various areas with the same set of parameters with a model performance comparable to the one of local models parker et al 2011 this model is based on existing models but applied at other scale and consider less parameters that make its use easier this approach is different to the previous one as it can be applied for large scale studies like climate change scenarios 4 1 proposal for a new model the lgm uses a simplification of baumgärtner s approach only to calculate the first cohort and not the entire population of l botrana as in the original function the overwintering submodel considers the general approach of the sum of temperatures i e cumulation of temperatures as gdd or growing degree days and not the speed of growing as in baumgärtner s original function then the adults submodel uses the same parameters to cumulate heat between and within the generations as we describe in the fig 7 the lgm model and baumgärtner s model have the same range of errors to simulate the first cohort of a l botrana population even with a simplification of the calculation methods this comparison between both models provided a second partial validation of the lgm model because it is not exhaustive as the years observations and sites latitude are different in both studies in the lgm the results of the different tests showed similar performances for all models and developmental phases studied we nevertheless propose to use the w model to simulate different temperature responses because it better reflects the known biological response of l botrana to temperature thus wang is the unique function used to simulate both overwintering predia dia and post dia and adult flights submodels this is a classical approach using a first model with the calibration and validation data sets a preliminary analysis revealed that the small divergence between the models allowed us to test another model with all the data sets table 9 provides the statistical analysis with all the parameter values used for the calibration validation and the entire data set it summarizes the proposed model lgm model showing the different parameter sets used to simulate the three phases of the overwintering period but the single common set of parameters used to simulate all the phases 10 and 50 of the different generations of the adults flights concerning the adult development stage the results confirm our hypothesis that a standard set of parameters is sufficient to accurately simulate the voltinism of l botrana from diapause to last flight in terms of the 10 and 50 of the male flights this finding is important because as we described in the introduction it is common practice to recalibrate phenological models for each generation beddow et al 2010 thus in previous studies table 1 authors proposed a different set of parameters or models for each generation considering that the biological response was different during the entire cycle we are convinced that our approach introduces more robustness into the simulation of the life cycle of l botrana indeed it allows applications at large geographical scales without adapting the model to local parameters whether this can also be extended to other species remains to be investigated 4 2 advantages and limits of the generic model to define the lgm we considered the models with the best statistical criteria and the most representative biological processes known from the literature esm7 one of the major difficulties we encountered was to model the overwintering phase as we did not dispose of data to represent the associated intermediate phases i e end of prediapause and end of diapause the calibration of this complex submodel was hence performed targeting the date of the 10 of the first generation at each site the lack of intermediate information is a common problem faced in developing phenology models for plants chuine et al 2016 in our case the data collection have been a long process and the quality selection of the male flights had to correspond to sites where we had meteorological data available close by at least 15 years some authors like amo salas et al 2011 and armendáriz et al 2009 integrated relative humidity in their model but they concluded that the value error with or without this parameter was not a significant influencing factor indeed we did not consider relative humidity as in baumgärtner et al 2012 as we did not have such data available for all our sites another limit of this study concerns the data that have been selected and converted to a comparable and standardized unit but the observed data do not consider a protocol and the heterogeneity of the observed data can alter the quality of the calibration observation values obtained in the laboratory in controlled conditions at constant temperature where rates of development are estimated approximately briere and pracros 1999 torres vila et al 1999 picart 2009 can differ considerably from those observed in the field and between the sites or by calibrating models using local conditions arca et al 1993 torres vila et al 1999 severini et al 2005 moravie et al 2006 the large latitudinal range of study is complex as seen in fig 5 where some extreme values representing the 4th generations in south of spain not present at other sites fall for the cal dataset and not in the val dataset due to the randomization of the data selection and can alter the eff of the tests nevertheless the strength of this study has been to obtain a stable and robust model at a large spatial scale we believe that this work has contributed to raise new questions on scale applications for applied studies like climate change and on the methodologies used to simulate insect developmental processes the approach developed here making use of a simple and unique set of parameters representative of the biological response to temperatures has shown very interesting and encouraging results 4 3 future model applications we anticipate that lgm as a model is appropriate to conduct impact studies that integrate climate change scenarios in order to predict the future geographical distribution of ectothermic insects and the future extent of vulnerable areas multivoltine species are likely to develop more generations under warmer conditions caffarra et al 2012 reineke and thiery 2016 sensitivity analyses with lgm combined with phenological models for plants as grapevine for example will allow to identify critical shifts in the synchrony or asynchrony of different trophic levels host plants and insect pests and the ensuing overlap periods hoover and newman 2004 hirschi et al 2012 stoeckli et al 2012 gilioli et al 2016 nevertheless more data would have been useful to validate the choice of the best models this study could be improved by testing other regions of the world or by implementing the entire set of data used in concert with phenological models for crops lgm will help raise the awareness of producers on the emergence of new threats and adaptation of future treatment practices according to geographic areas again the advantages of lgm are its conceptual simplicity and generic parameterization which allow the implementation of climate change studies at the large scale for both plants and insect pests author contribution statement vc and igca conceived and designed the research and analyzed the data pc and jm contributed
