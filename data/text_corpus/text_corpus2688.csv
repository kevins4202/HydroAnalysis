13440,nano and micro plastics np mps represent one of the most challenging classes of micro pollutants with occurrence across all ecosystems and size distributions ranging from the nanometre to the millimetre scale these broad composition and size distribution ranges limit the efficiency of detection methods often inherently focused on a single and narrow class of np mps sizes in addition to their demonstrated native toxicity np mps may act as efficient carriers of pollutants and pathogens onto their surface facilitating the transfer and penetration of other classes of hazardous materials this comprehensive review presents the key challenges related to soil air and water np mps i sampling and extraction ii using defined synthetic np mps for spiking environmental samples and for model studies and iii characterisation a major challenge discussed in this paper relates to the lack of relevant characterisation strategies for the np mps materials enabling simultaneous identification quantification and generation of statistical size distributions this critical discussion ends with a series of well informed propositions to support the systematic assessment of the impact of np mps materials spanning from materials science and characterisation as well as environmental and chemical engineering keywords microplastics nanoplastics occurrence extraction characterisation microplastic analysis microplastic model synthesis microplastic surface alteration 1 introduction the current spread of anthropogenic pollution across all biomes has never been as visible and dramatic as during the past decade key contributing factors are the significant increase in industrial and agricultural activities as well as increasing densities of urban centres and global human population boom over the past five decades contaminating air soil freshwater streams and oceans 1 an emerging class of contaminants only put in light 15 years ago are micro plastics 2 3 micro plastics mps are very broadly and inaccurately defined as particles which maximum size shall not exceed 5 mm despite the large variety in the particle size shape and composition found in the environment 4 5 a vast majority of mps in number concentrations are however not likely found in nature on the millimetre scale but on the micro to nanometre scales due to fragmentation of larger items upon wear off the mps found in the environment are extremely varied because of the different types of polymeric materials origin ageing and utilisation history size distribution and surface alteration which not only relates to the intrinsic properties and shapes of the materials but also to their manufacturing routes and original purpose 6 7 mps collected in biomes are generally classified as either primary or secondary depending on whether they are found as originally produced or as fragments from larger plastic items 8 10 properties such as the buoyancy density surface chemistry and roughness will all dictate the infiltration of these mps across the biomes and their resilience and potential ingestion by various lifeforms 11 12 toxicological risks for lifeforms associated with mps do not only arise from the native properties of the materials but also from potentially adsorbed or desorbed chemicals from the mps surface or bulk 13 17 the ability of mps to act as carriers of pathogens additives such as plasticisers or dyes used in their manufacturing and chemicals placed in close contact with the mps during their utilisation or once released in nature represent equally important challenges 18 20 the fragmentation of mps into smaller components or the development of nanotechnologies involving the engineering of nano or micron sized polymeric materials has led to the formation of an even more challenging sub class of mps called nano plastics nps commonly classified as particles smaller than 1 Î¼m 2 9 21 22 such nps present large surface to volume ratios compared to mps a few orders of magnitude larger making them more prone to adsorption of compounds diffusion across air soil or water plumes and taking up by micro organisms wildlife or plants thus posing a threat to human health by entering the human food chain 23 several fragmentation pathways have demonstrated the release of very broad size distribution of nps and mps pathways such as chemical degradation through oxidation or biodegradation could also alter the surface properties and change the expected behaviour of these np mps in solution limiting agglomeration or flocculation efficiencies thus affecting their ability to be separated or captured from complex air soil or water matrices 24 given the current breadth of studies published in the field of np mps science cross comparisons of either protocols or data are often difficult due to the lack of standardised protocols 6 25 27 in order to further the understanding of the risks posed by np mps key challenges lay in the homogenisation of good practices through the development of new technologies and methodologies to better extract quantify and characterise np mps in terms of size and number distributions chemistries levels of surface contamination as well as surface properties all affecting their interactions with biomes recent reviews were primarily interested in presenting occurrence levels in specific trophic areas as well as potential relationships between surface adsorbates and toxicity levels to microorganisms present across marine aqueous environment or soils 5 27 28 considerations towards the lack of appropriate characterisation techniques were also evidenced and pointed to directions of great need primarily towards complex matrix extractions and characterisation as well as sub micrometre or nanoscale materials quantification and identification 26 27 29 this review presents a comprehensive overview of the recent strategies to characterise or model np mps materials first a discussion on occurrence levels across the different biomes is provided to highlight challenges unique to each type of ecosystem as well as expected np mps contents and natures challenges related to the extraction protocols of np mps from real complex matrices will be critically discussed to underline current barriers the second section discusses recent strategies to synthesise and modify model np mps for research and benchmarking purpose third current characterisation routes to identify particulate matter levels types and properties are discussed a roadmap is proposed on directions for the field to evolve through a set of guidelines and recommendations for the standardisation of analysis and characterisation such approaches are critical to ensure the rapid development of standardised methods and good practices to facilitate cross studies comparisons and swift normalisation of studies in this emerging field by supporting sampling processing and use of appropriate analytical tools 2 occurrence of nano and micro plastics in natural environments this section will briefly review the occurrence and level of contamination of particulates in air soils and water streams the purpose of this section is to develop a set of high level ranges of occurrences based on statistical studies to reveal not only the scope of the pollution but specific areas requiring action 2 1 airborne nano and micro plastics most plastic items are light weight 30 and may exhibit properties that can favour their wind conveyance 31 so that they can reach locations far beyond their initial emission source despite atmospheric transport being an important pathway for the dispersion of plastic particles in the environment np mps prevalence in the air has seldom been described in the literature 5 2 1 1 sources of pollution airborne airborne np mps may originate from the wind dispersion of particulates such as road dust and tire wears 32 poorly disposal of plastic pieces 33 34 or the direct erosion or abrasion of large plastic items 30 35 36 or microfibres released by synthetic clothing 37 which accounts for a large percentage of airborne mps a 20 min of normal activity when wearing poly ester outfits may produce up to 400 fibres per gram of worn fabric which would correspond to an annual release of about 1 03 109 microfibres per person 38 similarly domestic dryers participate in np mps airborne pollution with an estimated production of 58 m p fibres per 660 g of blanket loaded which would represent an emission of 3 103 airborne fibres per australian household each year 39 with the rising market demand in the clothing industry industrial processing of fabrics such as chopping cutting grinding or threading likely represents an overlooked source of plastics in the atmosphere 40 in 2018 about 66 6 million metric tons of synthetic textile fibres were produced 41 which could have subsequently generated important and still unassessed plastic pollution in the air strategies have been proposed to trace back the origin of airborne np mps based on the settling velocity of individual particles and the calculation of the trajectory followed by the particles np mps detected in air in the centre of london uk have reached deposition rates of up to 1008 m p m 2 day 1 with particles that would have been brought from locations as far as 60 km 42 precipitation events such as rain or snow are suspected to drive the deposition of np mps even though no clear correlation has been reported 5 43 indeed although droplets or snowflakes can facilitate the settling of particles upon settling their impact on the ground may also re suspend pre deposited particles the distance from the ground has been shown to be negatively correlated with the np mps concentration as reported in the city of shanghai where np mps concentration was 1 42 m p m 3 directly above the ground and 0 9 m p m 3 at a 80 m height 37 which can be justified by the difference in density between np mps and the air leading to settling in the absence of wind 31 42 the concentration of np mps has been revealed to reach 5 4 m p m 3 in indoor conditions 44 and lower values about 1 m p m 3 outdoors 33 37 44 since dilution may occur in open areas a thermal manikin was used to mimic the breathing mechanism through alternate pumping of the ambient air and estimated that 9 3 mps were inhaled for each cubic meter of air inhaled by a human being in his apartment for 24 h 45 furthermore it has been roughly calculated that 21 Î¼m sized pieces of plastic were inhaled every day by shanghai citizens 37 although most of the particles should be removed through mucociliary clearance 5 46 some may reach deep lungs and cause damage such as inflammation fibrosis and cancer 11 28 thus the focus has turned to the assessment of the toxicity of airborne np mps of both synthetic and natural fibres 43 an interesting area of research unexplored to date should also focus on np mps released by face masks and other personal breathing apparatus although face masks are designed to protect operators from external particulate intake the degradation over time of the fibres composing the active part of the masks may lead to consequent release of materials directly into the respiratory system the assessment of such release would be relevant to the general public health especially during pandemic times such as experienced with the covid 19 episode more and more data are available for the evaluation of airborne np mps but care should be taken when comparing raw data since the methodology for np mps counting may vary from one study to another table s1 2 1 2 occurrence and abundance the intrinsic physical properties of the particles such as their density size and shape may dictate their air transfer 36 47 throughout literature fibres have been identified as the predominant shape of airborne mps followed by granules and sheets table s1 5 48 and such fibre shapes have been particularly investigated to date 43 44 49 airborne particles not only comprise of synthetic particles but can also contain inorganic matter such as clay 50 organic cellulosic or proteinaceous materials 45 as well as natural fibres such as cotton or wool 44 and regenerated rayon fibres 43 both natural and regenerated fibres often represented substantial amounts of airborne particles with for instance in a parisian apartment france where only 33 of the fibres were synthetic 44 or in the streets of dongguan china where 73 of the reported particles corresponded to cellulose based materials 51 deposition rates along one of the catchments of the river trent in the uk were on average 1 8 m p m 2 day 1 for extruded fibres including synthetic and regenerated fibres and 128 4 m p m 2 day 1 for natural fibres thus demonstrating the predominance of natural components in certain areas 43 among reported polymers poly ester poly propylene pp and poly ethylene pe have been commonly found but large variations from place to place exist 5 for example pe and ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer represented respectively 48 8 and 22 of the np mps count in hamburg germany 52 whereas poly styrene ps 41 and pe 32 were predominant in a remote pyrenean mountain in france 31 the abundance of airborne np mps may also depend on external parameters such as the proximity from anthropogenic areas 37 49 height from the ground 51 precipitation events 31 44 or direction and strength of the wind 33 52 densely populated areas represent point sources for np mps pollution compared to sparsely inhabited locations thus could incur higher amounts of airborne np mps as reported for the city of paris where the deposition rate of np mps was around 110 m p m 2 day 1 in an urban zone and about 53 m p m 2 day 1 in the suburbs 49 a deposition rate of about 365 m p m 2 day 1 in a remote mountain of the pyrenees france was reported 31 which is higher than the deposition rates within large cities such as hamburg 275 m p m 2 day 1 52 or dongguan up to 43 m p m 2 day 1 51 this finding highlights the importance of wind mediated transport of plastics towards preserved natural habitats as well as the possibility to link plastic pollution and wind direction 37 42 2 1 3 sampling procedures airborne sampling has primarily been performed through three distinct methodologies namely active collection passive collection and dust sampling 5 53 active sampling collects suspended particles by pumping a known volume of air through a filter over a defined duration 33 37 44 the main advantages of this technique are related to the high level of reproducibility since the operating parameters such as the air flow rate volume sampled and pore size of the filters can be specifically selected 5 the possibility to capture all suspended particles in the surrounding environment also ensures a complete validation of the fractions present in the system nonetheless the nominal pore size of the filters will have an influence on the np mps recovery and to date the lowest pore size reported was 0 45 Î¼m 45 passive collection determines the atmospheric fallouts of airborne particles by retaining falling particles in a recipient mounted with a funnel of known opening surface area 31 44 48 49 51 52 passive sampling has been preferred in fieldwork since it does not require maintenance and energy supply thus can be conveniently applied to urban and remote areas 31 however the settling velocity of particles depends on their physico chemical properties where the heaviest and largest particles reach the sampling unit faster consequently care must be taken during the elaboration of sampling protocols to enable appropriate and statistically relevant extraction most sampling surveys span over several periods ranging from days to months 31 44 and methodological study focusing on the sampling duration has not been performed 54 single use plastic items can serve this purpose and to date only sweeping with hog bristle brushes 33 34 and vacuuming with a vacuum cleaner 44 have been utilised particles which settle rapidly might therefore be overrepresented and differences between soil based and airborne np mps becomes less pre eminent due to large changes in medium density 33 34 44 the collection of dust may therefore become problematic to evaluate the specific contribution of airflows to np mps life cycles and distributions across large areas 2 1 4 nano and micro plastic extraction airborne np mps counting and identification requires multiple steps for separating the particles from the matrix concentrating the analyte of interest or removing organic and inorganic matter that could interfere in the characterisation of np mps with outdoor sampling weather events such as rain or gusts can spread and dilute the particles supporting their diffusion into aqueous systems in this scenario researchers have coined the term wet deposition as opposite to dry deposition that describes sampling in the absence of precipitation episodes 47 filtration has been applied to separate the liquid and solid content of the samples but the efficiency of this step profoundly depends on the pore size of the membrane used since this would define the smallest size of particle that can be retrieved 31 the counting of plastic particles in such configuration is challenging and typically performed with particle counters which may partially or entirely overlook the smallest fraction nps that is believed to represent the majority in the number of plastic particles present in the environment 22 55 these particle counters are based on either optical detection of particulate matter or capacitive detection through narrow channels diffusion and are designed as well as calibrated for narrow size distribution particle targets these techniques would also not allow for materials selection accounting for other types of natural or inorganic materials counting adding noise to any analysis organic matter present in airborne samples has been eliminated with the use of strong oxidants such as h2o2 31 33 and naclo 52 but organic digestion has not been routinely implemented due to the low content of natural particles present compared to other media such as water and soil this limited concentration renders the discrimination of np mps from organic compounds manageable 37 45 furthermore the scope of the research may also justify not applying organic digestion as some may want to observe the relative prevalence of fibrous np mps vs natural fibres which could not be attained by such treatments 43 45 the removal of inorganic compounds was performed with density based separation processes using saturated solutions of inorganic salts such as nai density 1 6 g cm 3 33 and zncl2 density 1 6 g cm 3 31 34 44 table s1 the extent to which the extraction of np mps is to be performed mostly depends on the sensitivity of the characterisation techniques applied which will be further critically discussed in this review 53 airborne np mps could represent an underestimated pathway for np mps to reach the environment further research toward a comprehensive evaluation of the global quantity of np mps present in the air and the interactions between the air and other compartments would be required to understand the life cycle of np mps research investigating the occurrence of np mps in the air is still lacking adequate sampling pre treatment and analysis procedure harmonisation although recent progress has been made towards uniformity 5 56 a standardised protocol 56 has been proposed to comply with short time requirements complete study lasting for about 11 days reduced risks of contamination high recovery of np mps 94 4 recovery rate of spiked synthetic fibres and fragments and availability of analysis equipment 56 the lack of systematic approaches for such analyses represents a major hindrance to the detection of airborne np mps studies on np mps should focus on strategies offering the most appropriate protocols to their purpose and therefore consider carefully i the air sampling methodology ii the extraction of np mps and iii their characterisation techniques although active sampling appears to be ideal to ensure statistical representation such technique may be strongly influenced by the sampler height as well as the duration of the sampling process no study demonstrated to date the influence of these parameters on the np mps collection efficiency 44 45 the extraction of np mps is matrix dependent and the distinction between synthetic and natural materials especially fibres can be challenging criteria based on morphological features exist but further exploration towards selective dying of either naturally occurring particles 57 or np mps should be systematically done unless chemical analysis is otherwise performed 2 2 soil and sludge contamination soils and ground based media represent complex mixtures of solids whether organic or mineral and liquids 27 with organic contents varying from 0 02 wt for desert soils to almost 100 wt as in the case of bogs or surface litters 58 the interactions between minerals and organic compounds present within soils can lead to the stabilisation and persistence of toxic compounds over tens to hundreds of years 59 consequently underground plastic items may not undergo biodegradation unless specific plastic degrading bacteria are present 27 and thus could remain unaltered for many years as demonstrated for pp pvc and urea formaldehyde resins that were found unchanged after 32 years of burial in a japanese garden soil 60 2 2 1 sources of pollution soils and sludge since most human activities occur in land and on shore the risk of direct contamination of soils is high np mps present in soils can originate from agricultural practices such as the use of plastic mulching for crop improvements 61 biosolids spreading 24 62 63 irrigation with untreated or partially treated wastewater 64 65 but also from atmospheric inputs 5 66 lake water flooding 66 and landfill leachate 67 the process of covering a soil with a thin plastic film for increased yield and improved crop quality is named mulching 61 the application of mulching films generates a micro environment ideal for the growth of agricultural products e g increased temperature evaporation prevention 61 but benefits have been discussed since it was reported to deplete soil nutrients due to enhanced microbial activity 68 between 1991 and 2004 china has increased the soils covered with mulching films at a growth rate of 30 per year 69 which inevitably participated in the production of land based mps most of mulching films are made of pe or variants where pe is blended with other polymers but none of them has been reported to be fully biodegradable 61 mp concentration has been found to be positively correlated with the duration of mulching practice on agricultural soils with concentrations of about 80 m p kgdry solid 1 for 5 years of continuous mulching and 1076 m p kgdry solid 1 for a soil treated for 24 years 70 biosolids usage may represent the primary source of np mps in terrestrial ecosystems since waste water treatment plants wwtps concentrate plastic particles in the sludge 24 63 in 2019 3 7 mton of dry solids were produced by australian wwtps from which 67 was used for landfilling application 71 np mps in sewage sludge were also documented as high as 15 385 particles kgdry solid 1 72 which could subsequently lead to an annual input of about 3 8 1012 mps the direct input of contaminated sludge with a mp concentration of 45 5 g kgdry solid 1 was tested on a sampled soil the concentration of mps in the soil progressively increased after each sludge deposition cycle starting from 1 37 g kgdry solid 1 after one sludge application to end up with 4 38 g kgdry solid 1 after 5 cycles 63 besides between 4 1 and 13 1011 mps have been estimated to be introduced in agricultural soils of ontario each year due to the use of biosolids 73 such discoveries may question on the benefits of sludge application and regulations regarding the acceptable quantity of np mps present in biosolids could be expected in the foreseeable future 2 2 2 nano and micro plastic migration soils np mps entrapped in soils may not be static and may migrate horizontally or vertically depending on the surrounding ecosystem due to airborne or water based oceanic or river based currents requiring gradient of sampling to assess occurrence and contamination levels properly living organisms thriving and moving in soils can participate in the propagation of np mps through bioturbation 58 that includes ingestion and egestion digging burrows that could act as water channels for np mps displacement or particles stuck to living organisms 74 75 the influence of earthworms on the migration of plastic particles 76 78 was observed and found that earthworms were able to move pe beads ranging from 710 to 2800 Î¼m down to 10 cm within 21 days in a loamy soil 77 other organisms such as gophers and moles 79 or collembolas 80 may also play a role in the spread of plastic pollution within soils water percolation and leaching through macro and mesopores can also lead to the migration of plastic particles 74 np mps have been reported at concentrations up to 42 960 m p kgdry soil 1 81 with the majority of np mps being pe or pp 66 81 however large variability exists across the literature table s2 which can be explained by the intrinsic complexity of soils and origin of plastics soils remain an overlooked compartment which would deserve more attention especially for the effective detection of sub micron mps and nps 2 2 3 sampling of nano and micro plastics in soils and extraction soil samples are generally obtained via direct bulk sampling of a known mass or volume of matter for further processing but no sampling standardisation exists some research have relied on common tools applied to grounds e g auger corer 63 73 but the specification of the equipment used remains marginal sampling soil may appear to be straightforward but the collection methodology may introduce concentration extrapolation bias 27 depth of collection sampling site proximity from waterways are major parameters that have to be seriously considered prior to sampling to date np mps occurrence has been estimated at different depths but never above the metre scale table s2 since np mps can be relocated in the soil a clear justification of the soil depth and area sampled shall be provided to ensure statistical accuracy of the studies 27 in such circumstances solid expertise in soil geochemistry as well as knowledge of the inhomogeneities in term of composition of the sampling sites are required corer may appear as an appropriate technique to understand vertical distribution of np mps where separation could be achieved according to the soil stratification along the vertical axis rather than through pre selected depths the presence of np mps may then be analysed over the entire soil sample after homogenisation or extraction from selected soil sections such a methodology may provide valuable information on the concentration profiles of np mps along the depth of the corer with the possibility to correlate the migration properties of the particles with solid media characteristics determining the np mp migration rates and properties in ideal porous soil media 82 83 would support environmental sampling to feed theoretical models to better understand the fate of np mps in soils extraction of np mps from soil matrices represents the main challenge faced due to the high quantity of soil organic matter som 74 which shall strongly bind with np mps 27 the separation of np mps from soms and inorganics is commonly made by sequential drying sieving floatation filtration density based separation and finally digestion 27 common studies on soil geochemistry usually apply sieving with 2 mm mesh size but this cut off size is not appropriate to the definition of np mps and smaller sieve sizes shall be considered to discriminate further smaller fractions of materials 58 inorganics have been efficiently separated from np mps by density fractionation with concentrated nacl zncl2 nai solutions table s2 even though sodium polytungstate has been preferred for soil studies it was not applied to np mps extraction from soil matrices 66 soms cannot be completely removed through this technique because their density may generally vary from 1 to 1 4 g cm 3 58 soms are preferably removed via chemical digestion including mostly oxidants e g h2o2 and acids e g hno3 table s2 som removal with h2so4 h2o2 kclo naoh and hno3 were tested for np mps extraction from swiss floodplain soils 66 hno3 was found to yield better som removal with efficient ps pu pet pvc and pe extraction efficiency but resulted in the degradation of poly amide acrylonitrile and butadiene styrene this was considered as satisfactory for the purpose of the study since these components are not predominant in the environment 66 fenton processes were successfully applied in rich organic matrices but operated optimally in a narrow range of operating conditions e g t 40 c and ph 3 which would not be suitable in alkaline calcareous soils 84 alternative extraction methodologies have been successfully applied for retrieving spiked mps from soil samples thus could be applied to field studies total recovery of spiked pe ps pvc pet and pp mps during a 2 stage pressurised fluid extraction was obtained for a glass bead medium and municipal compost after optimisation of the extraction parameters 85 methanol was used to extract the non mp fraction at a temperature of 100 c and dichloromethane heated at 180 c achieved the mp extraction this method is theoretically size independent since plastics are dissolved during extraction which cannot allow the determination of the size distribution without prior fractionation and sieving 85 2 3 occurrence of nano and micro plastics in the aquatic environment the occurrence of np mps in aquatic ecosystems such as oceans rivers and lakes has gained great interest over the past decades to date although a literature is available to assess the occurrence of np mps in freshwater salinity of 0 5 ppt or less the volume of manuscripts for the lakes is limited compared to that of marine environment even though similar methodologies can or have been applied 86 2 3 1 sources of pollution np mps detected in the marine environment originate from fishing and recreational boating 87 88 but also from land based activities which represent up to 98 of plastics found in the oceans 89 91 the fishing industry is under strict regulations stated under the marpol 73 78 convention which prohibited the disposal and abandonment of plastic items including fishing gears and nets at sea 92 93 however challenging and scarce off shore controls as well as accidental releases participate in the plastic load in haline water bodies 23 94 with an estimated input of about 640 000 ton year 1 95 the fragmentation of sampled poly amide 6 pa nets from the venetian lagoon italy in laboratory conditions simulating the marine environment salinity of 30 g l 1 temperature around 15 c and abrasive forces was found to generate 750 microfibres per gram of net after 1 h of immersion 19 land based plastic pollution represents all plastic materials released from in land human activities that end up in seas coastal tourism 96 on shore production sites 97 leaching from landfills 98 as well as riverine import 99 wastewater treatment plants wwtps discharge 100 and atmospheric relocation 5 have been reported as sources of np mps pollution in the marine environment 90 the concentration of np mps was found to be inversely correlated to the distance from the discharge site of treated wastewaters in the helsinki archipelago with a reported concentration of 2 46 m p l 1 at the discharge site while concentrations of 1 74 and 0 51 m p l 1 at distances of 1 2 and 3 3 km from the effluent discharge site were reported respectively 100 rivers may also dramatically increase the amount of np mps flushed to oceans since freshwater media are prone to heavy np mps pollution from human activities including wwtps discharge tyre wear and household dusts to name a few 101 for instance a np mps concentration of 293 m p m 3 was detected upstream a korean river whereas 4760 m p m 3 were detected downstream after passing nearby numerous water treatment facilities 102 transport models have been generated to evaluate the magnitude of this source of pollution and when applied to the rhone river represents 163 tonnes of microplastics transported into the mediterranean sea each year 99 the contamination of freshwater by np mps is often characterised by a proximity to human inhabited regions and human infrastructures which are known to be point sources of np mps emission table s3 the pressure caused by industries and households located near rivers and lakes has been demonstrated in several cases 48 103 104 as an example the rhine river which is a densely populated and highly industrialised european waterway has recorded an average np mps concentration of 892 777 m p km 2 between basel and rotterdam 103 furthermore over 50 of the shapes reported were spherules that are commonly used in the plastic industry for the production of commodity items 2 which aligns with the ubiquity of packaging and office furniture factories along the rhine river 103 104 in remote areas leaching from soils due to agricultural practice such as mulching or sludge spreading 105 roads run off 106 aerial deposition 48 and improper disposal 107 may be the predominant sources of np mps for instance np mps concentration of up to 20 264 m p km 2 were reported in a remote mongolian lake where only small villages were present ashore 107 in that case np mps were attributed to the negligence of local populations who did not have adequate waste management systems in place 107 farming and surface run offs may represent the major pathways for np mps to reach groundwater through diffusion in the soil s micro and meso pores this aspect was confirmed with the observation of np mps with concentrations up to 15 2 m p l 1 in wells and springs sourced from underlying aquifers in the state of illinois usa 108 2 3 2 transport and abundance of nano micro plastics an overview 2 3 2 1 transport of nano microplastics through the water column the physico chemical properties of np mps drive their sedimentation across the water column as well as their horizontal displacement 4 109 most reported np mps in the aquatic environment such as pe pp or ps possess a density lower than that of seawater and similar to that of freshwater 90 110 111 which leads to their accumulation in sub surface water layers 112 more diverse compositions have been noticed in sediments where both heavy and light np mps can accumulate 113 for instance light polymers were detected into the sediments of the elbe river germany with pe ps and pp contributing to the np mps shares of 34 4 18 5 and 12 5 respectively 113 in the same river np mps concentration was found as high as 2 27 107 mp m 3 for sediments and 13 24 m p m 3 for surface water 113 stressing the role of sediments in np mps accumulation in sediments from the arctic ocean np mps pollution was found to reach 68 78 m p kgdry solid 1 with pp representing 51 5 of all np mps due to the impact of biofouling and hetero aggregation on the sinking process 114 such phenomena may lead to a stratification of np mps in the water column and sediments based on the density size shape and residence time of the particles hence the concentration of np mps can hardly be correlated with depth the vertical distribution of np mps in the monterey bay was reported for concentrations of 2 9 m p m 3 15 m p m 3 and 2 9 m p m 3 at depths of 5 m 200 m and 1 000 m respectively 115 heterogeneity in the polymeric materials was observed with pp particles present 25 m below the surface and denser polymers such as poly oxymethylene and poly methyl methacrylate detected at a depth varying from 100 to 600 m particles residing in water columns are prone to major alterations of their initial properties through biofouling and or hetero aggregation with noms reducing their buoyancy over time 4 116 the colonisation of pe packaging by bacteria and molluscs has been observed after only a week of immersion in the plymouth harbour and the materials were found to sink in laboratory settings due to buoyancy reduction after spending three weeks in the harbour 117 although sinking may occur after microbial colonisation the density of attached organisms could diminish as a consequence of diverse hostile mechanisms such as foraging by predatory species or changes in light exposure thus leading to the oscillating upward and downward movements of np mps 118 in a similar fashion hetero aggregation may also take place between np mps and natural organic matter that mainly originates from the decay of aquatic animals or plants as well as secretions of exopolymers by multiple organisms such as bacteria 119 or gastropods 120 this process embeds np mps in a cohesive gel like matrix which can lead to their settlement as demonstrated for ps nano and microspheres with size distributions ranging from 50 to 10 000 nm in the presence of microbial glycoproteins 119 ultimately fouled and denser np mps made of materials such as pet pvc pu or alkyd 4 would reach the seabed quickly where they can be incorporated into the benthic ecosystem until perturbed or stressed by external stimuli the diversity of np mps shapes detected in the aquatic environment such as fibres or fibre fractions spherical fragments likely from the wear of other materials and thin films generated from packaging table s4 can also impact the particle behaviour in the water column materials with similar chemistry and volume may settle and disperse with different velocities according to their shapes and hydrodynamic properties 18 for instance experimental and theoretical approaches have shown that cylindrical particles were subject to oscillation and rotation which induced a non linear settling trajectory as compared to their spherical counterpart 121 2 3 2 2 horizontal displacement of nano micro plastics np mps abundance in the aquatic environment can also be impacted by the horizontal transport of np mps due to water streams the aquatic environment is generally characterised by a strong dynamic nature with advective phenomena such as currents waves tidal regimes or thermohaline gradients 89 which subsequently participate in the worldwide spread of np mps even remote oceans such as the arctic ocean where np mps have been detected from both the surface waters 18 m p m 3 and the ice cores 2 17 mp l 1 are no longer free from np mps 122 ice drifts travelling from the siberian shelves to the western arctic and the central arctic were hypothesised to be the cause for np mps detected in this area multiple models were developed to explain the dynamics of oceans and have been applied to np mps pollution in order to explain their dispersion patterns 123 124 floating and submerged np mps may not be subject to the same type of dynamics which could lead to drastically different patterns along the world s oceans modelling based on well established oceanic mechanisms has shown that the migration of np mps towards subtropical and subpolar regions was stronger for np mps deeper in water streams compared to sub surface debris 125 nonetheless more data is still required for swathes of the open ocean southern hemisphere equatorial regions and coastal waters to obtain reliable models fitting with field measurements 25 shores and beaches represent a clear border between land based and pelagic np mps and the extent to which plastics are transferred from one medium to the other is yet to be fully assessed high concentrations of np mps up to 285 673 m p m 2 were obtained for coastal sediments where most np mps were composed of expanded ps which is the main component of on shore buoys 126 thus tides may also deposit np mps produced offshore onto coastal lands in addition to the dynamic of water currents man made water constructions as well as weather events can also contribute to the distribution of np mps in the aquatic environment specifically in freshwaters the influence of dams on np mps distribution was investigated with six reservoirs located near ithaca in new york by comparing np mps concentrations upstream at the reservoirs and downstream 127 five of the six barrages followed a consistent pattern with higher surface np mps concentrations upstream than at the reservoir site an inverse trend was reported in that same study as expected for the concentration of np mps in the corresponding sediments specifically striking results were found for a dam located in the fall creek usa with surface np mps concentrations of 25 m p l 1 upstream and about 8 m p l 1 at the reservoir site while 100 m p kgdry solid 1 and around 220 m p kgdry solid 1 were detected in the upstream and reservoir sediments respectively 127 a study performed in the lake donghu in china showed that peaks in np mps occurrence appeared during heavy rainfall with np mps concentrations reaching 30 m p l 1 compared to 12 m p l 1 one day before the authors were able to describe a linear correlation between the increase of np mps occurrence and rainfall 128 rainfall and storms may promote urban and agricultural run off thus facilitating the transport of np mps from lands to different water bodies 128 129 furthermore the storms and precipitations may also strengthen the hydrodynamic conditions of shallow water bodies where the re suspension of sediments may occur 86 129 np mps initially entrapped in sediments may be dispersed in the water column due to the storm action thus artificially increasing the concentration of np mps in the freshwater system even though only an exchange between sediments and water may be responsible for this trend previously the effect of biofouling on vertical transport has been mentioned but higher trophic levels organisms may also participate in the relocation of np mps in both the water body and sediments representative examples include the consumption of np mps by zooplankton which will participate in the spread of materials through defecation 130 or subsequent ingestion by predatory species the overall dynamic of np mps migration in the aquatic environment is complex and more research dedicated to this area is to be performed 2 3 3 sampling procedures the capture of np mps from the aquatic environment can be performed in the water body in the sediments and on shores where tidal events may induce continual exchange between water and coastal lands to date three methodologies have been developed for collecting np mps from these media including i selective sampling ii bulk sampling and iii volume reduced sampling 4 23 selective sampling corresponds to the direct extraction of np mps from the medium by visual monitoring of the area scanned beaches and to lesser extent surface waters are more suitable for this technique although the scientific pertinence of the approach may be debated 4 low accuracy as well as high risks of misidentification or overlooking of smaller np mps smaller than 1 mm however limit the applicability of this technique nonetheless it may represent an opportunity to raise public awareness of plastic pollution through sampling sessions including non scientific operators 131 citizen science combined with proper standard operating procedures may also help to source and monitoring plastic pollution cost effectively in multiple locations 132 bulk sampling collects the entire matrix components without any separation of the constituents of the sample the yield of np mps extraction may become the limiting step since contamination can be introduced by the capture technique the finite size of the container such as 10 l for water matrices may lead to poor statistics for representing broad areas of interest 4 133 bulk sampling in a 5 l hull and reduced volume sampling manta trawl was compared in the baltic sea where the concentration of np mps was found to be 1030 m p m 3 with bulk sampling whereas it was 0 07 m p m 3 with manta trawls 134 the sampling of sediments primarily follows this methodology with specific equipment lowered to the seabed such as corer and van veen grab which may sample precise volumes of sediments 4 135 volume reduced sampling where only the fraction of interest is conserved represents the most applied sampling technique for water sampling this technique relies on the use of trawls e g manta bongo plankton nets which are towed over a transect using fine meshes with typical sizes of 300 330 Î¼m 133 unlike for bulk sampling large volumes of water can be sampled but the lower limit of np mps that can be detected by this technique is determined by the size of the mesh used furthermore overlooking the smallest fraction of np mps may drastically modify the concentration measured a study comparing the occurrence of np mps in subtropical gyres of the northern hemisphere by using trawls with mesh sizes of 100 333 and 500 Î¼m showed that for the 100 Î¼m mesh the np mps concentration was 2 5 and 10 fold greater than that of the 333 and 500 Î¼m meshes respectively 25 although large mesh nets overlook the smaller fraction of np mps fine mesh with pore sizes between 50 and 100 Î¼m may capture them at the expense of clogging and fouling limiting the water influx a compromise between the number of particles retained and the output of the technique and statistical representativeness of the water body must be found in that case the fast clogging of a 100 Î¼m net in japanese rivers supported the shift towards nets with mesh sizes of 335 Î¼m used for durations of 5 30 min 111 clogging may be a more important issue for eutrophic lakes and the sampling methodology would have to be adapted accordingly by for instance implementing larger mesh size shorter sampling durations and consecutive filtration through different sieves another volume reduced approach consists of filtering water samples through one or consecutive filters to analyse large volumes as well as limiting clogging some freshwater streams with strong unidirectional advective flows such as rivers may avoid the use of a motorised vehicle during the sampling campaign 111 although volume reduced approaches have been favoured in field studies to sample surface or sub surface np mps bulk sampling draws the benefit of versatility with the possibility to sample np mps in shallow waterways 105 alternative approaches have been developed to assess np mps prevalence deeper in the water column as an example a remotely operated vehicle pumping water through a filter was used to monitor np mps concentration for depths as deep as 1000 m 115 2 3 4 extraction procedures extraction protocols of np mps from sampled matrices are system dependent and are selected according to the sensitivity of the characterisation techniques used the marine environment has been the first target for assessing the prevalence of mps thus more accurate detection and separation protocols have been developed for plastic particles 4 np mps detection protocols evolved from simple procedures such as filtration directly followed by microscopy to elaborated protocols for the removal of organic and inorganic compounds that may disturb the identification sediments and beach samples are typical media that require the removal of natural material for retrieving and characterising plastic particles 90 most np mps have a density ranging from 0 8 to 1 4 g cm 3 so that density separation using salts with densities higher than 1 4 g cm 3 should be used to retrieve particles from aqueous matrices and sediments that have an average density of 2 65 g cm 3 136 various brine solutions have been proposed such as saturated nai nacl sodium polytungstate and zncl2 137 the recovery of mps with different chemistry e g pp ps and pvc was found to be positively correlated with the density of the salt solution used in this study znbr2 at 25 of saturation d 1 71 g cm 3 appeared to be the best choice for mp extraction from sediments saturated nai solutions have often been prioritised due to economic and environmental reasons but can also react with starch based filters and hamper np mps identification 136 aqueous samples are less impacted by the presence of inorganics because of their long residence time in the water body that allowed them to settle nonetheless organic materials may be abundant in such matrices especially after volume reduced sampling where large volumes of water samples may have concentrated both np mps and natural organic matter 138 to date no standard protocol has been developed for the digestion of organic matter where chemical degradation e g h2o2 fenton s reagent hcl naoh and naclo as well as enzymatic digestion e g proteinase cellulose lipase chitinase have been used 139 the digestive step must i degrade contaminants ii be time and cost efficient and iii not alter the morphology and size distribution of np mps 133 fenton s reagent has been found to provide a mild oxidative environment that achieved efficient degradation without damaging mp particles 84 besides enzymes achieve excellent np mps extraction and digestion with proteinase k was found to conserve the initial aggregation state of nano sized plastic particles whereas aggregation was observed after acidic treatment 140 although largely overlooked aggregation is a key parameter determining the toxicity of a contaminant and critical analysis of the effect of separation steps on the particles should be more regularly performed nonetheless enzymatic digestion is expensive and not all laboratories have available enzymes thus conventional oxidation approaches with h2o2 have been favoured table s3 and s4 alternative extraction procedures have been successfully applied for separating np mps from both the water column and sediments methodologies based on the hydrophobic affinity between mps and oleic mixtures have shown remarkable recovery yields for large np mps the efficiency of a novel separation method using castor oil for mps ranging from 300 to 1000 Î¼m was recently demonstrated the recovery of mps pp ps and pmma spiked into sediment and soil matrices was achieved up to 99 even though high organic matter content may be responsible for poor recovery digestion cannot be avoided and represents one of the most efficient alternatives to density based separation techniques 141 3 synthetic nano micro plastics utilisation or generation parametric studies to investigate np mps chemical and physical properties require model np mps particles to mimic the size shape and composition of np mps commonly found in the environment this section summarises the existing strategies to generate model np mps for laboratory work and discusses the suitability of each approach based on the study needs fig 1 3 1 purchase of off the shelf nano and micro plastics off the shelf products are among the most convenient ways to obtain pure and ready to use mps most studies involving the use of spherical np mps source their material from microbeads mbs manufacturers 65 142 148 which can supply mb samples made of ps pe or pmma with a size ranging from 0 02 7000 Î¼m table s5 mbs with narrow size distributions with less than 5 or 10 beyond the specified size range are usually sold by manufacturers fig 2 a and b 149 154 other physicochemical properties such as fluorescence colour and surface functionality can be tuned commercially to meet the requirements of specific investigations such as analytical and biological studies 150 153 154 commercial mbs have been extensively used in studies investigating the toxicity of np mps on aquatic species 65 146 148 155 156 since it was reported that up to 8 billion mbs can be released per day in the environment 157 most biological assays focusing on np mps ingestion use ps fluorescent or coloured mbs that can be easily identified within the tissue and organs of the organisms 65 146 148 although pe is one of the main np mps constituents a lower number of experiments has been conducted with pe mbs compared to with ps 144 158 this is probably because ps mbs are a common standard for instrument and process standardisation and therefore most manufacturers offer a wider range of ps mbs than pe table s5 although chemical manufacturers produce bulk volumes of ps and pe mbs for diverse industries such as civil engineering formulations and coatings purchasing small quantities of mbs for research purpose is often challenging although mbs have been used for a long time in np mps studies their use is typically limited to simple spherical models while a growing number of reports on the occurrence of np mps in natural environments are now demonstrating the presence of more complex shapes including irregular flat and fibrous np mps of various sizes micrometre sized plastic sheets and fibres such as metallized poly ethylene terephthalate pet glitter 159 and precision cut microfibres 160 are also available the diversity in terms of size and composition of these materials is however limited and may not reflect materials found in ecosystems alternative routes to synthesise np mps of controlled composition shape and size are therefore required 3 2 extraction of nano and micro plastics from commercial products daily life products such as cosmetics and textiles represent up to 37 of all np mps found in oceans 161 extracting np mps contained in these items is a low cost solution used to source realistic np mps that would have been released in the environment tables s6 s7 and s8 3 2 1 beads and fragments plastic mbs have been deliberately used in personal care products as exfoliators or fillers at concentrations up to 10 wt 162 making rinse off cosmetics a cost effective way of recovering mbs for lab work purpose most common procedures involve the use of hot water to dissolve the product matrix before filtrating mbs through a series of filters ranging from 2 5 50 Î¼m 162 168 table s6 a wide variety of mbs can be found in personal care products including those with a smooth or rough surface 29 163 164 and those containing additives such as tio2 164 or al2o3 whiteners 29 surface roughness can be altered during the manufacturing processes of the mbs and the cosmetic product therefore mbs extracted from diverse products can display various surface roughness 29 163 164 interestingly most mbs extracted from cosmetic products are made of pe 162 164 167 which largely contribute to np mps pollution along with ps 169 although pe mbs can be purchased from dedicated manufacturers table s5 personal care products constitute a complementary method to source pe mbs unexpectedly most mbs found in cosmetic products are of irregular shape and size ranging from the nanoscale 9 170 across the microscale 168 171 and up to the milliscale 29 172 173 fig 1 c and d although large particles have been easily identified as broken mbs 163 granules 165 or threads 163 166 173 nanosized fragments are more complex to characterise 9 170 pe fragments smaller than 0 1 Î¼m were collected in facial scrubs through filtration with 0 1 and 0 2 Î¼m filters followed by high resolution sem imaging 9 170 mps released in the environment can easily break down into hazardous nps increasing their number concentration by ten folds upon fragmentation following a crack propagation and failure mechanism 9 nps are of growing interest due to their unique colloidal properties nevertheless no manufacturers offer ready to use nanosized plastic fragments to date nps found in facial scrubs represent up to 3 4 wt of the product 170 hence sourcing nps from cosmetic products appears to be a relevant alternative 3 2 2 fibres synthetic textile fibres are estimated to constitute up to 35 wt of all primary plastic debris found in oceans 161 amongst which poly ester fibres constitute the most abundant fraction 49 174 175 microplastic fibres mfs detected in the environment mainly originate from laundry whereby over 6 000 000 textile fibres from a single 5 kg load wash may be released 16 this concentration represents less than 0 03 wt of the wash 16 although a growing number of studies are now focusing on synthetic fibres and several research groups have sourced their model np mps materials from washing machine effluents by recovering the fibres shedding from the fabrics 176 177 however the size desired number and composition of the recovered fibres largely depend on the type of fabric used and on the laundry conditions 20 poly ester mfs shedding from garments can vary from hundreds of microns 16 177 to a few millimetres 20 178 in length for an average of 15 Î¼m 16 20 176 178 although the fibre length can be impacted by the type of yarn used and whether the garment may be manufactured with continuous or staple fibres mfs with a broad length distribution can still shed from the same garment resulting in polydispersed samples 178 the number of fibres shed from a piece of fabric can also be impacted by the type of sewing and the amount and type of detergents 16 a poly ester woven fabric made of multiple yarns can release 3 5 million fibres per kg of fabric whereas a poly ester knitted fabric made of a single yarn releases less than 2 million fibres in similar washing conditions 16 the use of liquid and powder detergents can also dramatically enhance fibres shedding by 8 and 20 times respectively 16 table s7 3 2 3 sheets although the presence of flat plastic particles in the environment has been previously reported 174 179 180 the contribution of these micrometre sized plastic sheets to np mps pollution remains unknown due to a lack of experimental data mp sheets originate from various sources such as paint and film packaging but also from glitter 181 which can be used as model particles for studies investigating the impact of mp sheets on the environment glitter can be extracted from cosmetic products such as facial scrub 163 or nail polish which have been found to contain glitter particles 50 75 Î¼m large and 20 Î¼m thick 182 most glitter particles are made of pet covered by a metallic layer providing reflective properties to the particles 182 this layer can be removed by mild acidic treatments 181 to obtain neat pet flat sheet particles modelling regular flat mps found in the environment table s8 extracting glitter from cosmetic products has the advantage of yielding np mps with a more complex mechanical history than ready to use glitter nevertheless other routes can be followed to generate more relevant np mps sheets such as irregular flat fragments released from plastic bags or packaging 183 184 3 3 sourcing of model nano and micro plastics via top down and bottom up approaches 3 3 1 top down approaches secondary np mps can be artificially generated via a top down approach by mechanically breaking down plastic pellets or daily life plastic products such as coffee cup lids textile fabric and plastic bags tables s9 s10 and s11 the purpose of this process is to quickly generate np mps from various materials to represent those in the environment 3 3 1 1 fragments lab scale milling systems have been predominantly used to break large plastic items into np mps ranging from 7 to 1000 Î¼m 185 190 in some cases plastic items are frozen into liquid nitrogen to stiffen the plastic material and facilitate their fragmentation before being milled 188 186 190 liquid nitrogen is used at temperatures ranging between 210 and 196 c which is lower than the glass transition of common polymer materials such as pe pet and ps plastic pieces become brittle when in contact with liquid nitrogen which facilitates the shattering of the larger plastic items during the grinding process leading to np mps although other lab scale systems have generated np mps using equipment such as high power horn sonication 9 and torque rheometry 191 these specific devices are not readily available in all lab facilities household appliances such as kitchen blenders are a cost effective alternative to obtain np mps fragments ranging from 0 1 up to 1000 Î¼m 145 189 190 192 liquid nitrogen cannot be used within these devices but plastic pieces can be frozen in liquid nitrogen first and then ground with ice to keep a low grinding temperature and increase the brittleness of the plastic material 189 although the energy given to the raw plastic material can be controlled its bulk mechanical properties are usually not homogenous due to the manufacturing process and use of the product 2 plastic based everyday life products were exposed to thermal and mechanical stress during their manufacturing process such as extrusion and blow moulding which can result in crazing a phenomenon responsible for the formation of localised microvoids on the glassy areas of a plastic material 193 these voids eventually develop into cracks leading to material failure under sufficient energy load such as during grinding 193 a wide distribution of np mps fragments is therefore commonly obtained upon grinding depending on the size and manufacturing history of the original plastic pieces used the type of plastic material and whether milling systems or kitchen blenders are used fig 2 e and f ground np mps are filtered through sieves 185 188 189 192 194 and filters 145 191 to separate np mps into fractions that can be used further depending on the investigation requirements table s9 3 3 1 2 fibres synthetic microfibres can be recovered by cutting and grinding fibrous materials such as textile fabric 195 197 ropes 198 199 and filaments 191 200 table s10 although cutting with sharp scissors and grinding can yield fibres down to 30 Î¼m in length 197 198 fibres larger than 1 mm are also generated within the same samples 195 196 the polydispersed samples can be used as such 196 197 or sieved into fractions to investigate specific length ranges 198 although the lack of accuracy of grinding and hand cutting techniques prevents the generation of controlled length distribution of microfibres cryogenic techniques such as cryo microtoming can address this issue by providing a well controlled cutting step fig 2 a and b cryostat microtomes are heavily used in the biological field to prepare frozen sections of organic tissue for microscopic analysis 201 tissues are embedded in a freezing agent before sections are cut at a thickness down to 5 Î¼m at a temperature between 20 and 80 c 201 a similar procedure was recently designed to cut microfibres from pet pa and pp poly filaments producing almost 60 000 fibres smaller than 50 Î¼m in length from a 3 m long filament within 1 h 200 a standard length variation smaller than 15 Î¼m can be obtained with this versatile method which can generate a wide range of cut fibres with a narrow size distribution 191 200 3 3 1 3 sheets flat microplastic fragments have recently become of interest since the fragmentation of single use plastic carrier bags into np mps have been reported in air soil and water ecosystems 202 although mono dispersed samples of np mps sheets can be purchased as glitter irregularly shaped sheets as found in the environment can only be generated via a top down grinding approach resulting in a board size distribution fig 3 c and d single use carrier bags have been used to generate model np mps sheets by grinding pieces into 60 600 Î¼m large irregular flat fragments by mimicking plastic bags breakage occurring in the environment 203 np mps sheets can also be sourced from ground daily life products such as gloves balloons food packaging and inflatable toys 204 205 plastic bags are complex to break down due to their flexibility nonetheless liquid nitrogen can be used to facilitate the grinding process and enhance the release of np mps 204 poly ester films used as cling wrap document sleeves or labels could also be milled or cut to generate np mps flat fragments however such method has not been reported to date sourcing model np mps fragments fibres and sheets can be done by grinding or cutting large plastic pieces either with sophisticated techniques such as cryo sectioning or simply by using a kitchen blender table s11 to date none of the top down techniques presented in this section successfully produced a suitable quantity of np mps with a monodisperse or narrow size distribution which could be useful when comparing the impact of the size of np mps on the environment 3 3 2 bottom up approaches controlling the size distribution of artificially generated np mps is a major challenge that can be tackled with bottom up techniques laboratory synthesis of nano microbeads and nano microfibres using radical polymerization and spinning techniques respectively can be performed down to the nanoscale with a controlled dispersity tables s12 and s13 3 3 2 1 beads monodisperse ps beads can be fabricated by emulsion 206 208 or dispersion 209 211 polymerisation table s12 both processes are complementary since emulsion polymerisation typically yields beads from 30 to 500 nm in diameter while dispersion polymerisation produces beads within the range of 1 15 Î¼m 212 this size difference is due to the polymerisation mechanism induced by each technique whereby monomers are either soluble or insoluble in the continuous phase of the dispersion or emulsion process respectively 212 although optional divinylbenzene is commonly used as a crosslinker during the polymerization of styrene to enhance the mechanical properties of the formed beads 206 210 213 emulsifiers and stabilizers such as sodium dodecyl sulphate and poly vinyl pyrrolidone are required during most emulsion and dispersion polymerizations respectively to stabilize the particles and prevent them from agglomerating 212 beads are eventually separated from the solution once the reaction is over by successive precipitation or centrifugation 209 ps nano and microbeads may be produced by radical polymerization under mild conditions whereas pe polymerization requires high temperature or pressure to be conducted 214 215 synthesizing monodisperse nano and microbeads by radical polymerization is quick but requires specific equipment chemicals and knowledge to be performed unless pe beads with a specific surface chemistry are required ps polymerization seems the most convenient strategy to self generate model mp beads fig 2 g and h 3 3 2 2 fibres pp pet and pa are amongst the most abundant synthetic np mps fibres found in the environment and mainly originate from synthetic textiles marine ropes and nets 49 174 216 fibres with diameters down to the micrometre range are produced via conventional spinning techniques such as wet and melt spinning while smaller diameters are obtained via electrospinning 217 a wide range of fibre compositions and diameters can be obtained by tuning the parameters of each technique table s13 poly olefin poly ester and pa fibres have been long produced via melt spinning which only requires to melt the polymer extrude it and draw it to obtain microfibres from 10 to 100 Î¼m in diameter 218 220 the melt spinning process can quickly yield large amount of fibres collected on a roller nevertheless this technique is energy consuming since raw polymers need to be heated above their melting point to be extruded diameters below 5 Î¼m cannot be obtained by melt spinning but can be reached by electrospinning which can generate pet and pa nanofibers down to 255 and 60 nm respectively at ambient temperature 221 222 electrospinning is an effective method to produce nanofibers by applying an electrostatic field to a polymer solution 223 224 pp nanofibers are more difficult to obtain by electrospinning since hazardous solvents and elevated temperatures are required to dissolve pp this issue has been addressed by adding surfactants to molten pp prior to being extruded during melt spinning which significantly reduces pp spun fibres diameter down to 400 nm 225 melt electrospinning writing can alternatively be performed to yield fibres with a sub micron diameter 226 virgin plastic pellets are commonly used as raw materials to generate spun nano and microfibres as well as recycled plastic waste 219 which can be processed under similar conditions as opposed to beads which are ready to be used after fabrication spun fibres generated as a fibrous mat require an additional cutting or grinding step to yield fibres with a specific length as described in section 1 3 1 2 aligned fibres can be specifically processed by electrospinning 221 to be subsequently sectioned with a cryostat at a controlled length and generate a more narrow size distribution 200 fibres cryo sectioning can only be conducted with a cryostat and requires more preparation and optimization time than other top down procedures which limits its use to specific investigations where the fibre length distribution must be narrow spinning techniques are a convenient way to tune model nano and microfibres according to specific needs however these processes demand a strong expertise and appropriate equipment to be successfully conducted 3 3 2 3 sheets stretch films and plastic bags are usually processed by blown film extrusion which can draw films made of diverse polymers such as pe pp and ps 227 lab scale blown film extruders could be used to consistently generate a thin pe pp or ps film with controlled composition and thickness subsequently cut or ground to generate model np mps sheets alternatively molecular templates could be used to generate ultrathin np mps films as previously performed with graphene sheets to design ultra flat organic films 228 unlike polymerisation and spinning techniques no bottom up method has been used to source np mps sheets to date main limitations are due to the equipment expertise and time required to yield a suitable amount of sample which render model np mps sheets more complex to obtain via a bottom up approach than beads and fibres 3 4 limitations of sourcing model nano and micro plastics model np mps must meet specific requirements regarding their shape size and size distribution while being representative of real np mps as detected in the environment a wide variety of well controlled shapes can be obtained via the four sourcing routes presented in this work table 1 nevertheless controlling the size and size distribution of irregular np mps remains a major challenge model np mps fragments can be either extracted from daily life products or generated via top down techniques nonetheless these methods yield polydispersed np mps samples which are not suitable for studies requiring a narrow dispersity table 1 although sieving solutions have been developed to reduce the polydispersity of such samples 191 sub micron np mps are usually missed due to the minimum mesh or pore size of the sieves and filters used a potential alternative would be to perform field flow fractionation fff to separate np mps into fractions from 50 Î¼m down to few nanometers in size 229 230 the buoyancy of most np mps allows them to be easily suspended in water which would facilitate their separation by fff uv and dls detectors could be combined with the fff system to assess the concentration and particle size of the np mps fractions directly and therefore generate ready to use suspensions of np mps at a controlled size and concentration although fff can separate mps as small as 10 nm and generate fractions of nps particles at a flow rate up to 10 ml min 1 229 230 the initial sample must contain enough nps to achieve nps concentrations suitable for further investigation in a reasonable amount of time concentrated suspensions or powder samples of spherical nps can be purchased or fabricated at a lab scale nevertheless these nps beads are less relevant when it comes to mimicking real nps samples since presenting significantly fewer effects on their surface fig 2a and b nps identification within environmental samples is challenging due to the complexity of soil and water matrices hence the generation of nps in the environment is still not well understood 231 this research gap has impeded progress on the development of model nps sourcing methods which are not well controlled yet developing a combination of sensitive analytical techniques facilitating the detection and quantification of nps could overcome this major hurdle for np mps related investigations 4 methods to alter model nano and micro plastics for specific purposes when sourcing model np mps to meet the investigation requirements it is sometimes necessary to implement subsequent modifications to facilitate np mps identification mimic the weathering np mps are exposed to when released in the environment or load np mps with relevant concentrations of contaminants this section reviews current techniques that can be used to modify the bulk and surface physico chemical properties of np mps and discusses the impact of such modifications on np mps buoyancy and agglomeration behaviour 4 1 tagging techniques to facilitate nano and micro plastics analysis np mps detection and quantification is usually performed by visual identification or spectroscopic analyses however these techniques lack accuracy and are often time consuming 232 tagging has recently risen as a quick and reliable alternative to identify np mps by using lipophilic dyes detectable with fluorescent or uv light 233 fluorescent np mps are widely used for toxicological assays where locating np mps in tissues or organs of living organisms fed with np mps is crucial to understand np mp toxicity 12 234 236 commercial fluorescent np mps are available as spheres which are not representative of irregularly shaped np mps found in the environment tagging procedures have therefore been developed to stain a wide range of np mps materials and shapes nile red nr is the most common dye used to stain np mps due to its high affinity for a broad range of polymeric materials such as pe pp pet ps and nylon rendering these materials fluorescent between 254 and 530 nm excitations 237 240 nr staining is conducted by submerging np mps in a diluted nr solution for 0 5 24 h usually followed by a filtration step to recover the stained np mps 238 239 the stained np mps are then examined on the collection filters under uv light at a specific wavelength and identified based on their emission spectrum care must however be taken when selecting the collection filter to minimize its interference with light when stained for instance nr stained nitrocellulose filters are fluorescent from 470 to 530 nm while glass fibres and pc filters are not from 254 to 625 nm 237 besides the excitation wavelength must be selected based on the composition of the sample to ensure all np mps are detected although most nr stained synthetic materials can be identified by exhibiting a strong fluorescence at 470 nm excitation wavelength stained organic matter also fluoresces at 470 nm therefore a digestion step is required to ensure that no organic matter is left in the sample 237 an alternative is to work under 254 nm excitation where stained organic matter does not fluorescent nevertheless several nr stained materials such as ps and nylon cannot be identified at 254 nm which limits the use of such procedure to pe pp and pet materials only 237 although nr appears as a versatile tool to facilitate np mps detection a commercial textile dye idye pink has been reported to provide similar if not superior staining performance to nr regarding fluorescence intensity and stability during exposure to living organisms 233 idye pink stained ps microparticles stayed fluorescent over 72 h upon ingestion by a salina shrimp with a fluorescence intensity up to two orders of magnitude higher than that obtained for nr stained np mps 233 several dyes may also render specific synthetic materials highly fluorescent such as acridine orange with pet or safranin t with cellulose acetate 237 although nr is the most versatile dye to tag np mps several other dyes are relevant to facilitate np mps identification in environmental samples provided that the right excitation light filter and exposure medium are combined to np mps of appropriate composition fig 4 alternatively radiolabeling may be used to detect 18f labeled np mps in toxicological studies via positron emission tomography or single photon emission computed tomography as commonly performed with polymers or inorganic particles for in vivo medical applications 241 242 although the short half life t1 2 of 18f of 110 min may limit the application of such labelling to np mps used in long term experiments longer lived radionuclides are also available such as 64cu t1 2 12 7 h 72as t1 2 26 h or 124i t1 2 4 2 d and may be more suitable for np mps detection the synthesis of radiolabeled compounds can be conducted via direct or indirect coupling involving labeled prosthetic groups or chelating agents which selection depends on the material to be labelled 241 radiolabeling may also be used to investigate the adsorption desorption of labelled persistent organic pollutants onto np mps such as phenanthrene and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane 163 243 4 2 modification techniques to mimic environmental nano and micro plastics np mps found in the environment differ from pristine plastic materials in term of surface and bulk physical properties as well as chemical composition since np mps released in the environment have been exposed to diverse conditions and interacted with a wide range of pollutants and microorganisms 244 although a strong database has been developed regarding np mps fate behaviour and toxicity using pristine np mps materials 245 246 more complex np mps models representing environmental np mps are required to understand the true impact these plastic particles considering their interactions with the surroundings 247 4 2 1 artificial loading of contaminants on model nano and micro plastics np mps are considered as potential carriers of hazardous chemicals due to the adsorption desorption phenomenon occurring between np mps and contaminants in the environment 248 although contaminated np mps can induce inflammatory responses when ingested by aquatic species 249 the sorption mechanism and resulting toxicity of such contaminated np mps remain unclear this section summarises lab scale protocols to artificially load contaminants on np mps subsequently used for sorption and toxicological studies while matching the same level of contamination than real np mps tables s14 and 15 4 2 1 1 loading of pollutants pollutants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane ddts may be released in the environment from land based activities and a large number of studies have reported their presence onto np mps 187 250 257 pahs and pcbs are amongst the most detected pollutants on np mps surface due to their hydrophobic properties which facilitates their diffusion through np mps 258 259 in deionised water only two days are required to sorb benzo a pyrene bap on 20 Î¼m large ldpe mps at an environmental concentration of bap of 15 Î¼g g 1 251 using smaller np mps can increase the uptake of pollutants by 30 due to their larger surface to volume ratio and available specific surface area 254 as an example 6 4 Î¼g g 1 of pcbs can sorb on 500 Î¼m large ps spheres while 8 5 Î¼g g 1 can sorb on 6 Î¼m large ps spheres for the same loading of np mps within two days 254 this aspect is environmentally relevant since up to 19 Î¼g g 1 of pcbs have been detected on np mps samples collected on a beach in japan 258 a prolonged exposure between the pollutant and np mps may bring the system closer to its sorption equilibrium corresponding to the maximum diffusion of the pollutant through np mps 260 a sorption equilibrium of 630 Î¼g g 1 of pcbs was measured on ps nanospheres 70 nm after six weeks of exposure 255 this sorption capacity is however over 30 times higher than that commonly reported on beached resin pellets 258 nonetheless determining the sorption equilibrium and kinetics is useful to subsequently tune the exposure time between np mps and pollutants and reach the desired sorption level pharmaceuticals such as antibiotics are an emerging class of pollutants which constitute a serious concern due to their prevalence in the environment 261 262 contrary to pahs pcbs and ddts which are hydrophobic chemicals antibiotics can develop polar interactions and hydrogen bonding with polymeric materials such as poly amide pa 16 hence within four days up to 2818 Î¼g g 1 of amoxicillin can sorb on pa particles smaller than 200 Î¼m in size 16 although the sorption of antibiotics by np mps is reduced in seawater 16 antibiotics present in freshwater could potentially sorb onto pa fibres released from laundry wash antibiotics have not been detected on np mps extracted from environmental samples to date however the toxicity of antibiotic loaded np mps has been reported 263 hence research in this area is most likely to rise in the near future 4 2 1 2 loading of additives additives such as phthalates polydibrominated diphenyl ethers pbdes phenols perfluorinated alkyl substances pfass and trace metals are commonly used in plastic materials as plasticisers flame retardant uv stabilisers and pigments respectively plastic additives are usually not chemically bonded to the polymer matrix but mixed with the polymeric matrix and may therefore migrate from the bulk polymer to their surrounding environment 264 265 plasticisers such as phthalate compounds commonly used in pvc materials have been detected on pp and pe np mp debris 266 267 and multiple combinations of additives np mps can be found in the environment such np mps can be produced at a lab scale to generate a consistent batch of additives loaded np mps at environmentally relevant concentrations table s15 phthalates pbdes and phenols can be adsorbed on np mps by mixing the additives solution with np mps and evaporating the solvent 268 this technique may however lead to a concentration of additives on np mps higher than the environmental reference 252 which can be avoided by reducing the concentration of the additives solution in contact with np mps 268 metal oxide pigments are widely used in the plastic industry and are therefore commonly detected on np mps 269 these pigments may also be released across the environment from agricultural automotive or marine industries and subsequently become adsorbed onto np mps thus increasing the concentration of metals present on their surface up to 15 mg g 1 270 artificial loading of np mps with metals can be performed with plasma emission standard solutions of metals such as cr cu and zn to achieve concentrations from 0 297 Î¼g g 1 within 48 h of exposure to pe fragments to 7 900 Î¼g g 1 after 14 days 15 271 metal loading has also been conducted using a plate coated with an antifouling paint containing cu and zn to simulate the transfer of metals leaking from the paint to np mps which resulted in cu and zn concentrations on np mps of up to 1 320 Î¼g g 1 within 14 days 13 although pfass substances are emerging contaminants which have not been detected on np mps to date pfass sorption capacity on np mps of up to 70 Î¼g g 1 have been reported 17 272 273 hence it is expected that research involving pfass loaded np mps will start to grow in the future 4 2 2 weathering of model microplastics a vast majority of np mps collected from real soil or water environment have been reported with a weathered surface resulting from external mechanical stress and oxidation 274 275 this section discusses current protocols used to generate artificially weathered np mps and their suitability for investigations focusing on the impact of weathered np mps on the environment tables s16 and s17 4 2 2 1 exposure to natural conditions the most straightforward method to produce a large number of weathered np mps is to expose np mps to natural conditions such as outdoor uv moisture and temperature while placed in soil water or air environment and retrieve them after a specific period of exposure 202 276 280 table s16 frame supports mesh bags or home made traps are commonly used to maintain plastic items such as ropes 276 carrier bags 202 278 microbeads 279 and fragments 277 in outdoor conditions the main chemical and physical consequences of weathering on plastic items are the oxidation of the material and the decrease of its mechanical properties 2 oxidation is usually monitored by assessing the oxygen to carbon ratio o c and the carbonyl index ci of exposed plastic items which may rise by more than ten times after exposure in air for 180 days 278 o c and ci are usually obtained via ftir or xps measurements of the aged np mps 278 281 tensile strength and brittleness are commonly used to investigate the physical impact of weathering which can induce the fragmentation of plastic materials into np mps smaller than 5 mm after 120 days of exposure 278 overall weathering is more severe under atmospheric conditions such as on soils or sand as opposed to marine and freshwater conditions where np mps are submerged in water 90 this phenomenon is most probably due to the lower temperature and decreased uv light intensity in aqueous systems which slows down some oxidation processes leading to less chemical and mechanical damage 278 furthermore biofilm formation is usually observed on plastic materials exposed over a long period to natural marine and freshwater conditions resulting in an unwanted surface contamination by marine organisms clay or sediments 202 277 279 this issue may be avoided by submerging plastic pellets under seawater or freshwater in glass trays and exposing them to natural solar radiation 282 283 4 2 2 2 exposure to simulated conditions accelerated ageing is commonly used to produce weathered np mps in a short amount of time equivalent to np mps exposed to outdoor conditions such as air water and soil for years 22 283 284 most protocols involve thermo oxidation 281 photo oxidation 285 and or chemical oxidation processes 283 and in some cases mechanical processes 22 to generate weathered np mps within timeframes as short as 3 h 285 table s17 heat treatments are well known to increase oxidation rates hence temperatures from 45 to 75 c are commonly used in combination with uv light to enhance the photo oxidation reaction taking place with np mps 284 286 after two months under natural air outdoor atmospheric conditions ldpe films carbonyl index ci reached 0 17 while only 72 h were required to reach the same ci upon exposure to uva at 60 c in a weathering chamber 287 ageing chambers are convenient to conduct simulated ageing tests since relative humidity temperature and uv irradiation are easily controlled this equipment is however costly and therefore not available across all facilities nevertheless accelerated weathering can also be performed using strong oxidation reactive such as fenton reagent ozone or hydrogen peroxide 283 285 288 fenton reagents are usually used to remove organic matter from np mps by exposing np mps for less than 10 min 289 exposure to fenton reagents for 30 days may also oxidise np mps and lead to an ageing degree after one month of exposure similar to that obtained for np mps exposed to natural conditions for 11 months 283 ozone treatments may also dramatically reduce np mps ageing time down to 3 h by generating ps np mps with a o c ratio of 0 62 285 while this ratio only reaches 0 2 after 11 months in outdoor conditions 283 although these strong oxidation treatments produce weathered np mps at a relevant degree of ageing some procedures can lead to the fragmentation of np mps which can be an issue when the aim is to obtain aged np mps within a specific size range ps and pe granules were found to break down after 30 days of exposure to a strong oxidising agent k2s2o8 at 70 c resulting in a decrease of the particle size from 50 to less than 20 Î¼m 283 similarly a long exposure time to uva uvb and uvc may lead to the embrittlement of plastic pellets which may not be suitable for further experiments 22 specifically the surface of artificially weathered pp pellets was found to erode during sorption tests rendering the pellets useless for the rest of the study 286 hence care must be taken when selecting the experimental conditions to generate artificially weathered np mps at the desired ageing degree and with suitable mechanical properties several accelerated weathering protocols involving a mechanical process such as a rolling bottle filled with sand may also be used to mimic the mechanical weathering occurring in the environment such as on the beach and generate on purpose np mps with a rough surface 22 np mp surface roughness is an important factor to consider when investigating biofilm formation 290 and np mp adsorption capacity 291 292 since an eroded rough surface can impact the interactions between np mps and their surroundings although physical etching can be performed to control the surface roughness of polymeric materials 293 294 no etching protocol has been developed for np mps yet although weathering under natural conditions is the most representative of the environment the need for long exposure time from months to years and the lack of reproducibility do not favour this weathering method against lab scale simulated ageing protocols which are quicker and allow better control of the process 4 3 consequences of surface modifications to mimic nano and micro plastics in the environment altering the surface and bulk properties of model np mp materials to mimic np mps extracted from the environment may impact the behaviour of np mps and therefore drastically alter expected behaviour compared to pristine materials np mp buoyancy can be affected by a change in np mp density due to the adsorption of inorganic and organic contaminants but also due to a change of crystallinity occurring upon weathering 276 295 a change of buoyancy can become an issue for investigations such as toxicity assays where organisms are fed with np mps in suspension in the culture medium sinking or floating np mps could decrease the availability of np mps to the organisms and lead to biased results another major issue potentially occurring upon np mps modification is the homo and hetero aggregation of np mps 9 119 296 297 the temperature ionic strength or presence of suspended matter may alter np mps electrical double layer thickness and surface charge leading to agglomeration in solution a high ionic strength such as found in seawater i 0 7 m can screen ps nps electrical double layer and therefore reduce the electrostatic repulsion occurring between nps and finally lead to their homo aggregation 297 as an example raising the solution temperature increases the likelihood of collision between nps which energy overcomes their potential energy barrier resulting in np agglomeration 297 finally the formation of complex hetero aggregates of ps nps with phytoplankton or exopolymeric substances was observed after being exposed to natural seawater which questions the use of natural water during weathering or sorption experiments 119 296 hence it is crucial to ensure that model np mps are stable in the target medium upon weathering or sorption procedures buoyancy issues can be tackled by optimising the density of the medium or by selecting an appropriate agitation device agglomeration issues can be avoided by carefully selecting the temperature ionic strength and composition of the medium more specifically when additional organic inorganic or biological species are present 5 challenges in the characterisation of nano micro plastics np mps come in a variety of compositions shapes sizes and surface contaminants affecting hydrodynamic stability in water uptake by cells and therefore toxicity 298 as well as specific interactions in their carrying medium 299 the history of the materials and their properties may lead to potential fragmentation or agglomeration thus requiring gentle but efficient extraction processes towards their analysis 300 301 the fracturing of composite materials and polymer at the filler polymer matrix interface is of particular concern and leads to faster ageing and fragmentation 302 the characterisation of np mps is also challenging due to the typically varied nature of the water matrices in which they were present or extracted from combined to their broad properties and morphological distributions 9 a sound base for scientists to benchmark techniques and make educated choices on appropriate characterisation techniques fit for purpose is therefore required 21 the aim of this section is to provide comparative information on the key precautions to be taken upon np mp extraction as well as to the main particle characterisation techniques currently available to assess the occurrence nature and size distribution of np mp materials in addition normalised approaches when dealing with np mp materials must also be developed and followed consistently to allow for assessment of studies reproducibility 5 1 extraction protocols and their potential impact on characterisation techniques particle characterisation techniques will require a degree of sub sampling to perform a measurement and the definition of a minimum volume and number of samples to be statistically relevant such approaches lead irremediably to issues around unreliable and unreproducible measurements which are empirically related to sampling strategies 303 particle counting approaches performed in the food pharma detection or synthesis industries where medium volumes of a few tens or hundreds of millilitres maximum measure only a small fraction of the overall materials within a production line 304 307 at the laboratory scale the percentages of the volumes utilised and analysed may be greater but given time and quality control constraints it is often unrealistic to test more than few millilitres for each repeat sample 308 it is therefore essential that the subsample measured by the instrument is as representative as possible of the entire process within product specifications challenges related to statistical relevance of such sampling across very large volumes will not be addressed in this section but must be kept in mind when engaging on the occurrence of statistical distribution analysis 309 in the following liquid suspension characterisations where samples are extracted directly from liquids or from solid waste will be primarily referred to as lixiviate corresponding to a solution generated by selective digestion of specific influent materials and offering higher purity than the source materials aspects such as the colloidal suspension stability including agglomeration of particles or sedimentation due to differences in relative densities as well as heterogeneous solute to particle interactions and chemical stability over time including solvent uptake or surface modifications will greatly affect the kinetics of the analysis such parameters will confer to specific techniques relevant ability to provide a clear picture of the colloidal system and its transient and steady state regimes 310 311 the characterisation of np mps regardless if in situ synthesised or extracted from soil or waters will therefore face the same challenges the agglomeration of nps has been extensively modelled and described and readers shall refer to reference manuscripts on unified agglomeration models as well as key mechanisms for self assembly in solution 299 312 the aspect ratio of nano sized particles from 0 d spheres 1 d nanofibres or nanotubes to 2 d sheet like materials will greatly affect the kinetics of agglomeration due to the enhanced contribution of surface interactions and specific surface area the understanding of such interactions for nano sized materials can be correlated thanks to the close density and buoyancy values to previous works on carbon nanomaterials such as fullerenes nanotubes or graphene 313 such methods were applied to the development of suspensions of polymeric nanofibres 314 317 particularly the interactions of nano sized carbon materials with np mp materials may support their extraction or characterisation in the case of liquid samples from marine environments aquifers or rivers numerous pre treatments must be carried out to ensure that the np mps are properly extracted from fresh sludge and marine effluents as well as to facilitate the analysis of samples expertise rising from years of work on nano macro latex particles used in biological applications as tags or drug delivery systems has paved the way for the development of isolation treatment strategies a very large number of strategies have been proposed and found to be efficient to isolate np mps for these effluents primarily relying on direct digestion of organics selective dissolution of surface inorganic adsorbents and densimetry sieving strategies 85 318 320 the transposition of a technique from one type of effluent to another comes with a range of challenges to match the relevant ranges of appropriate technique operation such strategies include direct liquid extraction density flotation techniques high pressure sieving and compaction as well as magnetic extraction to induce semi selective phase separation of the particles efficient strategies rely on the native properties of np mps and relatively strong resistance to acids bases as well as general sturdy mechanical properties often making them resilient enough to sustain strong without noticeable damages 321 322 risks associated to fragmentation or fracturing of the materials however exist and should be considered when implementing stressful extraction or purification mechanisms which is rendered more difficult by the broad size distribution and low buoyancy of np mps 323 systematic studies evaluating the impact of such treatment on model particle size distributions as well as yielding faster and more selective extraction protocols are however lacking and must be designed and trialled much less has been reported on soils pastes and solid source materials for np mps extraction grinding or dissociation of the source material matrix may be required to extract np mps and generate a lixiviate 324 similar to some liquid extraction technologies digestion of organic matter to recover otherwise undigested np mps was carried out as a pre treatment step with various chemicals including h2o2 fenton reagents and alkaline bases 84 allowing for a lean lixiviate formation as well as enzymatic reactions sludge compost materials were also evaluated and pre treated by soil fractionation through dry wet sequential separation and sieving 325 such separation processes are tedious but efficient and require large volume and repeat of samples to be statistically significant 326 physical grinding mechanisms may also lead to surface or bulk particulate damage thus affecting the surface chemistry through oxidation reactions but also and more prominently the particle size distribution this aspect was evidenced recently for np mps extracted from commercial cosmetic face scrub paste like materials which were found to fragment under mild stress the fragmentation was attributed to the history of the material and pre stressed or cracked area within the material 9 if a stable suspension or lixiviate is required for the characterisation test the effects of any sampling challenges due to unstable colloidal mixtures for instance may be minimised by homogenising and the material prior to testing the development of time stable suspensions which effluent stability depends on the proper operational properties of the technique needs to be controlled for each characterisation technique such kinetics may be ranging from seconds to minutes and will ultimately dictate the characterisation technique suitability and usability extraction of np mps was also achieved through relatively slow densitometry techniques by utilising gradients of highly saline suspensions of bromide salts after washing 327 which although tedious represents an accurate extraction protocol from colloidal to solid fractions for various polymeric materials the design of mixing demixing systems to render operation simpler and faster would be required to make this technique applicable for large sampling volumes of a few tens of litres or more a route to tackle such issues may therefore be to couple centrifugation to densimetry to collect kinetics data at various states of colloidal stabilisation although not applied to np mp separation to date sequential or inertial micro fluidic devices previously used for particulate matter separation could be one of such options but would nevertheless require pre treatments such as digestion to extract the np mp phase from the raw influent 328 329 5 2 size fractionation of polydisperse nano and micro plastics alternative techniques based on physical separation have been developed for measuring the size of nanoparticles one could mention differential centrifugal sedimentation dcs field flow fractionation fff or chromatography as widely used techniques falling into this category 21 330 both fff and hydrodynamic chromatography hdc have been used in np mp studies whereas to the best of our knowledge dcs has never been applied to np mp solutions dcs has been primarily used for the analysis of the interaction between biological material and nanoparticles 331 332 or the separation of cells components 333 5 2 1 differential centrifugal sedimentation dcs dcs separates particles according to their size density and shapes with the help of a spinning disc that exerts a centrifugal force towards the particles in this technique the particles are injected at the centre of the disc which rotation induces the migration of particles to the edges of the disc 330 since particles with different sizes shapes or densities do not move at the same pace stratification will appear with smaller and lighter particles close to the centre whereas larger and heavier ones will be found in the outer regions of the disc the distance of the particles from the centre can be correlated to the hydrodynamic diameter of particles through the stokes law 330 usually this method is applied for sizes ranging from 0 01 Î¼m to 50 Î¼m 334 even though the range may depend on the particle material 5 2 2 field flow fractionation fff fff stratifies liquid matrices flowing within a thin 50 300 Î¼m channel 229 under laminar flow by exerting a force perpendicular to the direction of flow 335 the force triggers the migration of particles towards a portion of the channel known as accumulation wall where an equilibrium between the force applied and back diffusion takes place and results in the stratification of the sample perpendicularly to the flow 336 since the flow velocity pattern of the laminar fluid has a parabolic curvature along the channel particles exhibiting different diffusivity behaviours relative to the applied force will be eluted at different times 229 many variants have been developed based on the nature of the force that can be thermal gradient electrical magnetic gravitational centrifugal and so forth 21 336 the most common configuration is asymmetric flow field flow fractionation af4 that uses a perpendicular flow passing through a semi permeable membrane af4 can separate a mixture of small particles 1 50 nm as well as large colloids 2 100 Î¼m 335 that can be composed of complex macromolecules such as proteins fulvic and humic substances or simpler entities e g poly styrene and latex beads 229 337 post separation detection techniques such as dls uv vis absorption fluorescence or pyr gc ms are commonly used for the characterisation of the separated entities 231 the applicability of af4 for nps and mps studies have been investigated in a handful of studies that mainly relied on mals 338 339 with additional analyses done by fluorescence 140 uv vis 339 or pyr gc ms 339 it has been demonstrated that spiked fluorescent ps and pe nps could be successfully retrieved and analysed in complex matrices such as fish tissues after enzymatic digestion followed by af4 140 nonetheless the authors also pointed out that the procedure had to be adapted to the type of nps to be separated efficiently a nahco3 solution would be more suitable for ps whereas an alkaline detergent fl 70 yielded better separation for pe 140 af4 may also produce measurement artefacts because of interactions between the particles and the semi permeable membrane the size cut off of the membrane will also determine the particles that can be obtained at the end of the channel 21 additionally an effect known as steric inversion occurs for particles of 1 Î¼m or above with a strong dependence on the channel thickness flow rate and cross flow the steric inversion leads to the co elution of large and small particles which may hamper the post separation characterisation steps 231 5 2 3 chromatography chromatography separates mixtures in liquid or gas solutions through differential partitioning between the mobile and stationary phases common techniques applied to the characterization of engineered nanoparticles include high performance liquid chromatography hplc gas chromatography gc size exclusion chromatography sec and hdc 231 all are defined for a different type of samples with sizes range of 5 nm 1 2 Î¼m 1 nm 100 nm and 1 nm 40 nm for hdc sec and hplc respectively 231 however hplc and gc do not separate particles according to their sizes but according to their chemical properties which can also be applied in the determination of contaminants adsorbed on mps 5 2 3 1 size exclusion chromatography sec sec is constituted of a column packed with inert and highly porous material with well controlled pore diameters small molecules and particles may have a longer residence time in the column since they can travel between the grains as well as inside the micro fractures in this configuration interactions between the static medium and particles are to be avoided to obtain discrimination only based on the size and shape of particles sec has been proposed to analyse pe beads in cleansing products with the possibility to obtain both the size distribution and np mp content per product after calibrating the ir detector the methodology was able to obtain robust size distributions with good resolution for bimodal samples with distribution gaps of about 55 000 g mol 1 167 however the resolution is often restricted to 10 species or less 340 recently sec has been applied for the study of polymer dissolved organic matter stressing that additive free polymers generated predominantly low molecular weight neutral species 350 da irrespective of the initial polymer chemistry pe vs pp and exposition to uv irradiation 341 however np mps are prone to fragmentation due to shear stress and collision against the porous stationary medium which may bias the size distribution determination and participate in co elution of particles 21 the applicability to environmental matrices is difficult since the shape greatly influences the retention of np mps in the column even when the molecular weight or volume are similar 340 correlation between the stokes radii and the retention in sec have been elaborated for natural compounds such as proteins and dna 340 similar calibration would be required for aspect ratios of well defined np mps before any consistent application in environmental studies 5 2 3 2 hydrodynamic chromatography hdc unlike sec hdc separates particles according to their size with completely non porous beads packed in the column the separation of particles is dictated by the hydrodynamic conditions generated within the interstices of the stationary phase where the mobile phase flows 231 342 space between the packing beads creates a velocity gradient with larger particles traversing the capillary in the centre of the flow where the velocity is maximum and smaller particles tend to displace on the edges leading to longer elution time for small particles 21 342 the ability of hdc to resolve polydisperse samples has been described for ps and pmma beads with sizes ranging from 2 21 107 to 1 39 1010 g mol 1 343 in this study hdc was not able to fully resolve quadrimodal samples but the use of multi angle light scattering mals quasi elastic light scattering qels and differential refractometry dri subsequent analysis provided sufficient information to overpass the detection limitations of hdc little has been done to evaluate the applicability of the technique to np mps however the use of plastic particles as models for calibrating or assessing the efficiency of the technique 343 344 may permit extrapolation of the results it has been demonstrated that the shape of particles had a major impact on the separation efficiency whereas the surface charge and chemical composition did not affect the separation noticeably 344 5 3 morphology and size particles may undergo several self assembly or agglomeration processes with other similar or dissimilar particulate matter or macromolecules while also capturing through surface chemi or physi sorption random contaminants present in liquids these aspects will significantly affect the relative size and shape of particles and therefore a choice of techniques required for distributions determination 5 3 1 liquid state characterisation 5 3 1 1 dynamic light scattering dls dynamic light scattering dls is a well established technique for the size determination of nano and microscale particles or aggregates 330 345 the technology relies on the light scattering of a monochromatic laser beam 346 by suspended nanoparticles undergoing brownian motion 347 dls calculates the average size distribution of a sample by analysing the variation of the scattered light intensity on a detector 345 dls is user friendly does not require intensive sample preparation and can be applied for particles ranging from 4 nm to 100 Î¼m 21 345 however the technology cannot resolve polydisperse samples and may only deliver an approximated size distribution shifted towards larger particles since the intensity of the scattered light is a function of the sixth power of the size of the particle 346 348 dls has not been routinely applied to np mps studies because of the impossibility to discriminate plastic particles from natural organic or inorganic content by light scattering and the lack of information on the shape of the np mps analysed 14 light scattering techniques calculate the hydrodynamic diameter of particles by considering them as ideal rigid spheres 346 even though particles within natural samples may likely not respect this hypothesis furthermore environmental samples may be composed of a wide size distribution of np mps which could not be accurately characterised by dls without proper preparation of the sample 330 347 dls may not be appropriate for direct size determination of np mps in complex matrices but the technology has the potential to be combined with other characterisation techniques for assaying the parameters of the system in simple methodologies for instance electrophoretic light scattering els and dls have been successfully combined to evaluate the aggregation state through the measurement of the zeta potential as well as the size distribution 5 3 1 2 nanoparticle tracking analysis nta nanoparticle tracking analysis nta is a characterisation technique that can determine the size distribution as well as the concentration of a sample based on particle to particle counting and analysis 347 349 likewise dls nta exploits brownian motion and light scattering for measuring the size distribution of a sample 330 350 the difference resides in the fact the nta tracks the short displacement of all particles individually thanks to a 20 x magnification microscope which results in the possibility to resolve polydisperse samples 347 351 352 nta can be operated for particles ranging from 10 to 1000 nm 21 347 and requires samples with a concentration of nanoparticles between 106 and 109 particles ml 21 349 this specific range of concentrations and the fact that the maximum permissible size is 1 Î¼m represent major drawbacks since this analytical procedures may be time consuming and requires extensive sample handling increasing the risks of contamination from airborne plastic particles 18 231 another disadvantage is the high degree of freedom the experimenter has during the analysis since visual selection during sampling may be performed to analyse and modify the settings of the software to obtain a better resolution 347 this aspect has been highlighted by a study where similar samples were analysed by five different research groups 353 in the absence of standardised guidelines on sample preparation and device operation high variability was obtained between the laboratories hence the development of robust protocols and the formation of the experimenter would be necessary to obtain valuable results to date nta has been applied to np characterisation by a handful of laboratory studies with well controlled experimental conditions 9 10 55 354 356 but has never found its place in field studies most of the sampling strategies applied in water media used towed manta trawl or plankton nets with mesh sizes always above 80 Î¼m leading to challenges if other contaminants non mps are also present in solution 138 smaller plastic particles have been rarely described in the literature because of practical considerations 231 indeed the sampling of nps which are all plastic particles below 1 Î¼m may pose a challenge since filtering real matrices induce fast clogging of tight pore filters and may require a labour intensive sampling campaign to obtain representative amounts of nps 138 as long as a robust sampling method for capturing nps in the environment does not exist nta could not be used to assess their relative abundance and particle size distribution 5 3 2 dry state characterisation 5 3 2 1 optical microscopy optical microscopy provides images of materials through the differences in contrast within the light reflected on the surface of the sample 21 this technique has been extensively used in np mp studies since this technology is fast cheap and simple 7 133 information on the size shape weathering state and breakage of plastic particles are obtained with the additional possibility to estimate the concentration by manual sorting and counting the spatial resolution is defined by the diffraction limit of the light used which mainly depends on the wavelength from 400 to 700 nm 357 and the aperture of the optical system 18 although the detection limit for light microscopy may range from 0 2 to 0 5 Î¼m 231 358 it would be largely inaccurate to use light microscopy for np mps below 10 Î¼m in environmental samples due to aggregation and interactions with colloidal matter 7 359 identification of np mps is complex in the presence of natural organic matter and inorganic particles and can induce misidentification and miscount 360 synthetic particles can be identified through visual criteria that are i no visible cellular or organic structures ii fibres should be equally thick along their entire length iii coloured particles must be homogeneous and clear with white and transparent particles requiring further analysis with higher magnification or fluorescence microscope 4 additional procedures such as hot needle test 361 362 or staining with a lipophilic fluorophore e g nile red 240 363 may decrease the risk of errors but are not completely reliable which still lead to bias a study evaluated that among 1279 suspected plastic particles extracted from the atlantic ocean and selected with optical microscopy 67 of suspected mps below 50 Î¼m were confirmed to be synthetic by raman spectroscopy whereas 83 of suspected plastic particles above 100 Î¼m were identified 359 optical microscopy and visual observation are necessary 364 but must be combined with suitable chemical characterisation techniques to obtain a representative and real overview of plastic pollution as mentioned before the possibility to classify particles according to their shape and size is the major asset of optical microscopy unfortunately it is a time consuming and mostly manual process to acquire reliable data since np mp shapes are mostly irregular key parameters need be measured to differentiate granules fibres from sheets spheres and fragments among primary parameters to be measured one could mention the area minimum and maximum diameter feret diameter and perimeter ideally other parameters used in microscopy such as the mean diameter the centre of gravity the radius of gyration or shape factors could be reported as well 18 furthermore the total number of particles counted should always be reported since it indicates the statistical pertinence of data 18 where optical microscopy fails to characterise the smaller fraction of np mps electron microscopy can be used since its spatial resolution is higher down to 0 02 nm for an energy of beam of 100 kev 357 5 3 2 2 electron microscopy em em techniques probe a material with a beam of electrons instead of photons under a strict vacuum a focused low energy electron beam is produced and directed toward the sample by electromagnetic lenses 357 conventional or environmental scanning electron microscopy sem is a high resolution 3d imaging technology based on the elastic scattering of the electrons whereas transmission electron microscopy tem provides 2d projection images by capturing the electrons that can pass through the sample on one hand sem does not require intensive sample preparation and is easy to use since it only scans the surface of the material on the other hand transmission electron microscopy tem requires ultra thin samples for the electrons to be transmitted 365 which inevitably complicates the procedure 330 both techniques are designed for the size determination of particles and can reveal additional information on the chemical properties of the material sem has been widely applied to np mp studies for determining the key features of particles such as their size aspect ratio or weathering state 18 although tem has known less popularity for the characterisation of plastic particles in the environment this technique can also provide valuable information on the presence of crystalline surface contaminants and on the level of amorphicity of the materials in em samples should be analysed with care because biological material or polymer based samples could melt shrink or charge under the electron beam 330 357 furthermore materials with poor electrical conductivity are not suitable for em unless additional coating with metals such as gold or platinum is performed 366 367 5 3 2 3 atomic force microscopy afm afm scans the surface of a sample with the help of a cantilever carrying a sharp tip moving across the surface the interactions between the tip and the sample change the relative position of the cantilever which can indicate the presence of grooves pits and peaks on the surface a laser reflected on the cantilever permits precise measurements of the deflection magnitude of the cantilever 21 afm can be operated in a vacuum air or liquid 231 and does not require intensive sample preparation 21 the mapping of surfaces puts afm in a strategic position for the physical characterisation of nanoparticles one of the major advantages of afm is the possibility to combine afm with chemical characterisation techniques like fourier transform infrared and raman spectroscopy 7 21 the technique is promising for nps analyses 7 but still suffers from major drawbacks that have not yet been alleviated unlike scattering technologies afm scans at slow rates 1 Î¼m s and cannot inform about the concentration within the liquid sample 21 furthermore afm relies on the interactions between a tip and the material which means that depending on the properties of the tip artefacts could be generated when analysing particles with different physico chemical structures 368 5 4 bulk chemistry and composition 5 4 1 vibrational spectroscopy vibrational spectroscopy represents one of the pillars of the chemical characterisation of any molecule and material all molecules may experience vibrations under visible infrared irradiation due to the elastic nature of chemical bonds resulting in characteristic spectra when irradiated over a specific wavelength range 369 most of the research on np mps have applied vibrational spectroscopy for determining the chemical composition of the sampled np mps through either fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir or raman spectroscopy fundamentally both techniques are complementary since ftir analyses vibrational modes that induce a change of dipole moment while raman detects those triggering a modification of the polarizability consequently the material to be analysed may be composed of vibrational modes that produce signals in ftir whereas no signal may appear in raman and vice versa 370 this consideration was investigated in a study aiming at answering if both techniques should be used to analyse sampled np mps or if they were equivalent 371 the authors remarked that pvc np mps were more detectable under raman spectroscopy whereas polyesters had a stronger signal with ftir furthermore ftir missed all particles ranging from 5 to 10 Î¼m and 40 of particles between 11 and 20 Î¼m whereas raman successfully identified these particles they concluded that both techniques can be used independently for np mps larger than 20 Î¼m but better accuracy would be obtained with both measurements 371 5 4 1 1 fourier transformed infrared ftir ftir may be operated in four variants namely transmission ftir diffuse reflectance ftir true specular reflectance ftir and attenuated total reflection ftir 21 to date the attention of researchers in the field of np mps has focused on transmission ftir and attenuated total reflectance ftir atr ftir in atr mode ir light enters the atr crystal in contact with the sample and is totally reflected at the crystal sample interface towards the detector 21 the signal sources from the penetration depth of the electromagnetic wave before reflection which varies proportionally to the ir wavelength applied 372 this is by far the most common ftir mode used in np mps studies for the chemical analysis of visually pre sorted suspected np mps 372 atr ftir is cost efficient requires little sample preparation and is non destructive even though the surface of the material may be indented upon tip compression onto the material 373 this mode is adequate to large np mps 500 Î¼m 231 but may lead to biased results if smaller particles or matter adhere strongly to the tip of the apparatus during operation leading to unwanted noise levels 373 transmission mode analyses the ir beam that passes through the sample which per definition requires thin samples that do not completely absorb ir light 21 furthermore since np mps collected in the environment undergo a succession of treatments that generally end up by a filtration step the transmission ftir analysis is generally performed with the particles directly on the filter in that case the filter is to be selected to avoid interactions with ir light which would lead to additional peaks in the spectrum related to the substratum 374 different ir transparent substrates have been proposed such as znse window 45 aluminium oxide filters 370 or silicon filter 375 silicon filters with a pore size of 10 Î¼m were proposed due to their transparency for a broad mid ir region 4000 to 600 cm 1 which was suitable for the distinction of chemically close polyesters such as poly ethylene terephthalate and poly butylene terephthalate 375 whereas aluminium oxide filters tested were limited to the range 3600 to 1500 cm 1 370 another aspect to consider in all ftir modes is the presence of impurities from organic and inorganic origin that can interact with the ir beam and produce a signal moisture is an important interference during the analysis which must be removed prior to analysis through drying steps 372 np mps in the environment are prone to chemical modification through weathering leading to the formation of chemical bonds that can be observed in the ftir spectra such as hydroxyl 3100 3700 cm 1 carbonyl 1690 1810 cm 1 and alkenes 1600 1680 cm 1 373 modification of the initial crystallinity may also lead to the formation disappearance of peaks 376 this difference may become an asset during ftir analysis to estimate the degree of ageing and weathering of a particle according to the intensity of characteristics peaks therefore carbonyl index hydroxyl index and carbon oxygen index have been proposed to assess np mp weathering 231 373 5 4 1 2 raman raman spectroscopy uses low wavelength dispersion lasers down to 500 nm which allows for a better spatial resolution as compared to ftir that is restricted to the infrared spectrum 1 Î¼m vs 10 Î¼m 18 231 raman spectroscopy may not be as influenced by water presence as ftir is 377 but is prone to interferences from sample fluorescence 375 organic materials and biological polymers are well known sources of fluorescence if excited at specific wavelength 375 which may overshadow the main raman signal 377 the removal of such contaminants through digestive degradation is therefore a critical pre treatment step an automated algorithm to suppress the fluorescence background generated by biofilms developed onto np mp particles was generated which remarkably resulted in clearer pe spectra 378 fluorescence may occur from dyes and additives encapsulated within the polymer material 377 as well as from the substratum where the analysis is performed 379 in the objective of determining the filter that would allow to obtain the better resolution with no background interference 11 membranes including modified poly carbonate silver aluminium oxide have been compared for the characterisation of np mps aluminium coated poly carbonate was found to yield lower noise and fluorescence production levels under laser excitation 379 5 4 1 3 combined techniques the most promising application of vibrational spectroscopy is the possibility to combine it with key techniques applied in np mps studies such as optical microscopy the hyphenated characterisation tool associated to optical microscopy and ftir or raman is defined as Î¼ftir or Î¼raman respectively to date Î¼ftir has been studied more than Î¼raman with continuous improvement towards automation for counting and chemical characterisation of particles 380 381 atr Î¼ftir has been tested but suffered from long scanning time on the order of seconds per point limiting throughput for large sampling or mapping areas 382 where the size of each pixel will vary from a few micron to a few tens or hundreds of microns depending on the crystal size and the light source consequently transmission mode appears to be the most promising technique especially with the introduction of multiple focal plane array fpa detectors 383 that allows the fast scanning of the entire surface of the filter instead of selecting an area as performed in early studies 384 fpa Î¼ftir successfully scanned a filter of about 10 mm in diameter in less than 11 h with the possibility to identify np mps down to 20 Î¼m 383 the challenge of Î¼raman spectroscopy remains the time necessary for obtaining statistically relevant signals due to the low intensity of raman scattering long acquisition durations are necessary which may lead to potential heating and degradation of np mps efforts are made towards the reduction of acquisition time by improving the detector type ccd vs em ccd and targeting the zones where the scans occur to avoid the point by point mapping that analyses the filter multiple times such progress has allowed the scanning time that was initially about 38 h mm 2 371 to be reduced to 20 s mm 2 380 however Î¼raman has been less utilised for the characterisation of np mps since long measurement durations and interferences with contaminant materials often occur 21 378 5 4 2 x ray spectroscopy 5 4 2 1 energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds eds is a feature available during electron microscopy analysis and represents a powerful tool for obtaining qualitative and quantitative information on the chemical composition of a sample during the excitation of the material with an highly energetic electron beam electrons from the core shells of the atoms are expelled with electrons from the outer shells that migrate to fill the formed electronic holes 357 when this event occurs x ray photoelectrons with energies corresponding to the electronic transition are emitted and captured by a semiconductor detector e g silicon crystal each chemical element can be segregated based on their x ray emissions that paved the way towards the analysis of environmental samples of unknown composition mps have been successfully identified via sem eds with chlorinated polymers such as pvc 385 or ptfe 386 particularly recognizable with the strong chlorine elemental signature additionally to the polymer structure eds was also used for assessing biofouling and inorganic scaling across np mps 387 np mps sampled in the north western pacific were found to yield nitrogen peaks under sem eds analysis even though nitrogen is not a component of common synthetic polymers the authors suggested to use the magnitude of this peak as a proxy for biofouling since nitrogen is a primary component of biofilms and cells 388 it is noteworthy however that the evaluation of low atomic number elements by eds is not quantitative and elements lighter than fluoride cannot be trustfully evaluated with this technique limiting its span the sample preparation represents the main limitation of sem eds since the procedure is time consuming and difficult to achieve 387 as mentioned for sem sample preparation plasma sputtering of carbon or conductive metals is mandatory for the success of the method the thickness of this layer is usually around 10 nm however a too thick coating will interfere with the other signals while a too thin one will trigger the accumulation of charge and subsequent degradation of the polymer 389 5 4 2 2 x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps during xps the sample is bombarded with x ray radiations e 1500 ev in order to detach core electrons from the material 369 the kinetic energy of the electrons is measured and correlated to the binding energies between entities present within the material the technology is close to eds but conditions are milder under xps e g energies hundreds to thousands time inferior thus it can deliver information on the sub surface chemistry of the material penetration depth 2 5 nm 390 xps may provide precious information about the surface of np mps and has already been used to investigate ageing and weathering processes 283 391 the potential of xps in ageing studies has been demonstrated with aged ps np mps where xps was able to generate deconvoluted 1 s orbitals of oxygen involved in different chemical groups such as ketone hydroperoxide and peroxycarboxylic acid 392 this technology may enlighten on the mechanisms of weathering through a deeper understanding of the chain reaction involved in the surface oxidation with key limiting steps associated with specific functional groups 5 4 3 sorption and surface adsorption an underlying effect of np mp pollution is the accumulation of pollutants onto the particles and within the polymeric network 393 the contaminants may either originate from the manufacturing of the initial plastic materials such as residual catalysts or additives 394 395 or from other anthropogenic sources leading to the pollution of the environment including pesticides or pharmaceutical compounds 396 from a chemical perspective one may differentiate metallic pollutants such as arsenic 397 chromium 398 and organic pollutants including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs 399 and polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs 400 different characterisation tools have been used in np mps studies for the specific detection of these two classes of pollutants in general the identification of sorbed chemicals is done after separating the compounds from the np mp surface 401 liquid solid extraction has been primarily applied with techniques such as soxhlet extraction 402 403 ultrasonic extraction 404 and solvent soaking 405 the separation efficiency is highly dependent on the nature of the species to separate as well as the properties of the np mps the description of the different options when dealing with extraction of sorbed chemicals goes beyond the scope of this section but has been described elsewhere 133 401 5 4 3 1 sorbed metallic compounds atomic spectrometry gathers an array of techniques able to detect trace metal species at concentrations down to 0 1 Î¼g l 1 the most common techniques applied in np mp studies for the detection of sorbed metals are inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms and flame atomic absorption spectrometry faas 13 406 inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy icp aes has also found its place in a handful of studies 398 407 409 icp triggers a so called hard ionization under an argon plasma where most molecules of the sample are reduced to the atomic state with free flowing electrons 410 two preliminary steps for liquid samples are introduced to produce fine aerosols d 10 Î¼m via successive passage in the nebulizer and spray chamber 411 before undergoing icp ionization the particles can be decomposed with aqua regia hno3 hcl 1 3 mol 394 398 in order to retrieve all metallic species sorbed by the polymer 395 icp ms quantitatively characterises the elements of the sample with the separation of ionised atoms based on their m z ratio whereas icp aes analyses the spectroscopic spectrum produced by the elements icp ms has gain in popularity and tend to replace other atomic spectrometry techniques due to its higher sensitivity 410 5 4 3 2 sorbed organic compounds to date hplc has been primarily used to either detect sorbed chemicals on mps such as phthalates 412 413 and phenanthrene 414 or to analyse mono and oligomers formed during the depolymerisation of mps such as pet and pc 34 415 the application of lc with short length np mps in environmental samples has been described with ps np mps with molecular weights below 3000 da that were successfully analysed via lc arpi hrms liquid chromatography atmospheric pressure photoionisation source high resolution mass spectrometry with a lower limit of detection of 30 pg l 1 416 gc has been applied to np mp studies as a part of a hyphenated characterisation set including thermal degradation analysis e g pyrolysis tga and dsc and mass spectrometry ms 26 volatile molecules produced by thermal degradation can be efficiently separated by gc and analysed via ms 6 conclusions challenges and prospects the following section will present critical aspects related to the extraction characterization towards potential remediation of np mps the authors emphasized the core challenges and routes going forward to enable is more systematic analysis and collection extraction ii novel approaches to evaluate concentrations and size distributions or surface contaminants levels across np mps as well as iii novel routes to synthesize model materials to be used for laboratory and pilot scale studies this section is first and foremost a piece of opinion aiming at highlighting good practices and strategies which should be implemented to resolve the emerging and worrying issues arising from np mp pollution 6 1 np mp occurrence and collection the alarming rate in the rise of plastic contamination in the form of particles and fibres is currently occurring across all environmental compartments this trend is not only a result of direct pollution but also of the degradation and fragmentation of plastic items stressed through photo chemical mechanical and biological processes these weathering and historical events will affect the properties of collected np mps and also their surface compositions leading to significant up takes in organic or inorganic matters which may affect their further uptake by biological or chemical remediation systems reported concentrations are therefore underestimating true concentrations both in number and weight due to the inappropriateness of current sampling and quantification methods the large variability in the quality and quantity of the data in the literature is nevertheless directly linked to the lack of normalization of sampling and characterization techniques used and available to date although synthetic textile fibres and fragments of np mps are the dominant source of plastic in the environment these concentrations will only increase over the decades to come due to the lack of recycling and repurposing strategies for waste materials a truly circular economy approach is required immediately to ensure the valorisation and repurposing of such materials as well as their recovery from contaminated environments a major challenge lies with the currently unexplored area of nanoscale plastic materials which are systematically un explored in literature with only a handful of studies focusing on this crucial challenge specific guidelines must be developed for extraction sourcing or synthesizing np mps in the laboratory and thereafter characterizing resulting distributions there is therefore clear need to develop a detailed catalogue of standardised procedures combined with specific standards and analytical protocols to source and characterise model mps of various sizes and shapes although the sourcing from commercial products is appealing since rapid and cost effective recent and well justified bans on the use of microbeads and shopping bags have reduced the availability of plastic based products in most regions 417 419 6 2 diversity in sizes and shapes the extremely large range of materials shapes sizes and surface compositions or contaminations reported to date make any pertinent laboratory scale experiment on the capture or remediation of np mp difficult weathering and surface chemical loading of np mps occurring naturally in ecosystems will alter the np mps properties and lab induced selective weathering is an extremely promising approach to generate sample sets relevant to that found during occurrence studies np mps loading can be performed under natural conditions by exposing np mps to the environment however such conditions are hardly reproducible and can take up to several months to achieve the same contamination level as np mps artificially loaded under lab conditions new benchmarked synthesis methods for the generation of model np mps at the laboratory scale are also required to better predict the impact of such np mps on realistic systems and to model their interactions with complex water matrixes and biological systems various methods for generating model synthetic micro plastic fragments fibres and sheets to be used for mimicking the size shape and composition of common np mps found in the environment have been discussed routes ranging from the selective extraction of microplastics from commercial samples to top down and bottom up approaches were discussed and require further works and international benchmarking these synthesis processes may induce chemicals and mechanical stresses to the np mps which may further alter the physical and chemical properties of np mps and their subsequent modifications 6 3 surface properties alteration and ageing in addition the chemical and physical changes caused to the plastics once they are released in the environment further challenges our ability to accurately extract and characterise np mps appropriate and pertinent detection systems and strategies although available for mps in the range of the tens to hundreds of micrometers in size are available are desperately lacking for smaller particle fractions there is currently no standardised method of sampling and analysis of plastics in the environment and multi scalar interpretation of data sets presented in the literature is therefore biased and must be rendered in the context of the methods used in each study making cross studies comparisons hardly relevant this challenge is further compounded by the presence of submicron and nanosized fragments within single environmentally sourced samples which are difficult to extract and simultaneously detect quantify a series of novel techniques and strategies are therefore necessary to fully characterise the materials and develop a fingerprint of the np mps present in the samples last routes to load np mps with environmentally relevant contaminants may be achieved if the np mps are synthesized in situ through bulk loading or surface encapsulation loading environmentally relevant amounts of trace metals or metal oxide materials on np mps can also be achieved through specific reduction or precipitation it is recommended to combine metals such as cr cu and pb to np mps materials such as pe pp and pvc for which these metals have more affinity 6 4 extraction identification and characterization the challenges faced by extraction and detection of np mps in the environment solid liquid or airborne matrices as well as in the laboratory are i the low concentrations ii the broad size and shape distributions iii the buoyancy and densities of np mps which are close to water iv the increase surface effects over bulk properties at the short micro and nano scales and v the interactions with adsorbed contaminants and others particulate or colloidal matters which becomes extremely important at high surface to volume ratios the development of tagging technologies to trace np mps across complex environments have also been discussed but requires further investigation to generate more specific and yet stable tagging strategies the development of new characterization routes must be developed for both size and chemical composition evaluations given the outputs of current technologies one should envision systems where pre conditioning is performed through separative microfluidics devices while detection and counting are achieved through ir raman coupled to improved nta or sas operating units np mp fragments fibres and sheets are usually not detectable by common analytical techniques which have been standardised for spherical particles hence one must ensure that specific procedures and algorithms are developed to analyse np mps of various shapes for instance although turbidity and optical measurements can be performed to assess the concentration of fibres in a sample they cannot be used to characterize directly size distributions solutions allowing for operation in raw samples or with less needs for pre treatments would greatly support such endeavours small angle scattering sas with x ray or neutrons could offer such a solution to reveal the properties of dispersions in complex solution matrices at the right camera length as previously trialled for nanoscale and sub micrometre materials 420 421 further research and technologies development must be funded at the interface of research groups and equipment providers to allow for the development of more efficient and versatile characterization tools it is equally important that these tools are democratized and designed to be portable or scalable to ensure that areas of needs are not left behind in their assessment of occurrence and analysis 6 5 prospects the purpose of the authors when developing this review was to present a fair and objective account of the field it is hoped that this will generate new discussions in the area of standardisation characterisation and remediation strategies the challenges brought to researchers and scientists by np mps are nearly un precedented and a one fit them all solution will not be found it is the belief of the authors that multi disciplinary strategies only with efforts at the government academic and industry levels are required to tackle these issues this strategy must start with better stewardship strategies to ensure that plastics are not disposed of improperly anymore and that circular materials strategies are developed to make better value of these

13440,nano and micro plastics np mps represent one of the most challenging classes of micro pollutants with occurrence across all ecosystems and size distributions ranging from the nanometre to the millimetre scale these broad composition and size distribution ranges limit the efficiency of detection methods often inherently focused on a single and narrow class of np mps sizes in addition to their demonstrated native toxicity np mps may act as efficient carriers of pollutants and pathogens onto their surface facilitating the transfer and penetration of other classes of hazardous materials this comprehensive review presents the key challenges related to soil air and water np mps i sampling and extraction ii using defined synthetic np mps for spiking environmental samples and for model studies and iii characterisation a major challenge discussed in this paper relates to the lack of relevant characterisation strategies for the np mps materials enabling simultaneous identification quantification and generation of statistical size distributions this critical discussion ends with a series of well informed propositions to support the systematic assessment of the impact of np mps materials spanning from materials science and characterisation as well as environmental and chemical engineering keywords microplastics nanoplastics occurrence extraction characterisation microplastic analysis microplastic model synthesis microplastic surface alteration 1 introduction the current spread of anthropogenic pollution across all biomes has never been as visible and dramatic as during the past decade key contributing factors are the significant increase in industrial and agricultural activities as well as increasing densities of urban centres and global human population boom over the past five decades contaminating air soil freshwater streams and oceans 1 an emerging class of contaminants only put in light 15 years ago are micro plastics 2 3 micro plastics mps are very broadly and inaccurately defined as particles which maximum size shall not exceed 5 mm despite the large variety in the particle size shape and composition found in the environment 4 5 a vast majority of mps in number concentrations are however not likely found in nature on the millimetre scale but on the micro to nanometre scales due to fragmentation of larger items upon wear off the mps found in the environment are extremely varied because of the different types of polymeric materials origin ageing and utilisation history size distribution and surface alteration which not only relates to the intrinsic properties and shapes of the materials but also to their manufacturing routes and original purpose 6 7 mps collected in biomes are generally classified as either primary or secondary depending on whether they are found as originally produced or as fragments from larger plastic items 8 10 properties such as the buoyancy density surface chemistry and roughness will all dictate the infiltration of these mps across the biomes and their resilience and potential ingestion by various lifeforms 11 12 toxicological risks for lifeforms associated with mps do not only arise from the native properties of the materials but also from potentially adsorbed or desorbed chemicals from the mps surface or bulk 13 17 the ability of mps to act as carriers of pathogens additives such as plasticisers or dyes used in their manufacturing and chemicals placed in close contact with the mps during their utilisation or once released in nature represent equally important challenges 18 20 the fragmentation of mps into smaller components or the development of nanotechnologies involving the engineering of nano or micron sized polymeric materials has led to the formation of an even more challenging sub class of mps called nano plastics nps commonly classified as particles smaller than 1 Î¼m 2 9 21 22 such nps present large surface to volume ratios compared to mps a few orders of magnitude larger making them more prone to adsorption of compounds diffusion across air soil or water plumes and taking up by micro organisms wildlife or plants thus posing a threat to human health by entering the human food chain 23 several fragmentation pathways have demonstrated the release of very broad size distribution of nps and mps pathways such as chemical degradation through oxidation or biodegradation could also alter the surface properties and change the expected behaviour of these np mps in solution limiting agglomeration or flocculation efficiencies thus affecting their ability to be separated or captured from complex air soil or water matrices 24 given the current breadth of studies published in the field of np mps science cross comparisons of either protocols or data are often difficult due to the lack of standardised protocols 6 25 27 in order to further the understanding of the risks posed by np mps key challenges lay in the homogenisation of good practices through the development of new technologies and methodologies to better extract quantify and characterise np mps in terms of size and number distributions chemistries levels of surface contamination as well as surface properties all affecting their interactions with biomes recent reviews were primarily interested in presenting occurrence levels in specific trophic areas as well as potential relationships between surface adsorbates and toxicity levels to microorganisms present across marine aqueous environment or soils 5 27 28 considerations towards the lack of appropriate characterisation techniques were also evidenced and pointed to directions of great need primarily towards complex matrix extractions and characterisation as well as sub micrometre or nanoscale materials quantification and identification 26 27 29 this review presents a comprehensive overview of the recent strategies to characterise or model np mps materials first a discussion on occurrence levels across the different biomes is provided to highlight challenges unique to each type of ecosystem as well as expected np mps contents and natures challenges related to the extraction protocols of np mps from real complex matrices will be critically discussed to underline current barriers the second section discusses recent strategies to synthesise and modify model np mps for research and benchmarking purpose third current characterisation routes to identify particulate matter levels types and properties are discussed a roadmap is proposed on directions for the field to evolve through a set of guidelines and recommendations for the standardisation of analysis and characterisation such approaches are critical to ensure the rapid development of standardised methods and good practices to facilitate cross studies comparisons and swift normalisation of studies in this emerging field by supporting sampling processing and use of appropriate analytical tools 2 occurrence of nano and micro plastics in natural environments this section will briefly review the occurrence and level of contamination of particulates in air soils and water streams the purpose of this section is to develop a set of high level ranges of occurrences based on statistical studies to reveal not only the scope of the pollution but specific areas requiring action 2 1 airborne nano and micro plastics most plastic items are light weight 30 and may exhibit properties that can favour their wind conveyance 31 so that they can reach locations far beyond their initial emission source despite atmospheric transport being an important pathway for the dispersion of plastic particles in the environment np mps prevalence in the air has seldom been described in the literature 5 2 1 1 sources of pollution airborne airborne np mps may originate from the wind dispersion of particulates such as road dust and tire wears 32 poorly disposal of plastic pieces 33 34 or the direct erosion or abrasion of large plastic items 30 35 36 or microfibres released by synthetic clothing 37 which accounts for a large percentage of airborne mps a 20 min of normal activity when wearing poly ester outfits may produce up to 400 fibres per gram of worn fabric which would correspond to an annual release of about 1 03 109 microfibres per person 38 similarly domestic dryers participate in np mps airborne pollution with an estimated production of 58 m p fibres per 660 g of blanket loaded which would represent an emission of 3 103 airborne fibres per australian household each year 39 with the rising market demand in the clothing industry industrial processing of fabrics such as chopping cutting grinding or threading likely represents an overlooked source of plastics in the atmosphere 40 in 2018 about 66 6 million metric tons of synthetic textile fibres were produced 41 which could have subsequently generated important and still unassessed plastic pollution in the air strategies have been proposed to trace back the origin of airborne np mps based on the settling velocity of individual particles and the calculation of the trajectory followed by the particles np mps detected in air in the centre of london uk have reached deposition rates of up to 1008 m p m 2 day 1 with particles that would have been brought from locations as far as 60 km 42 precipitation events such as rain or snow are suspected to drive the deposition of np mps even though no clear correlation has been reported 5 43 indeed although droplets or snowflakes can facilitate the settling of particles upon settling their impact on the ground may also re suspend pre deposited particles the distance from the ground has been shown to be negatively correlated with the np mps concentration as reported in the city of shanghai where np mps concentration was 1 42 m p m 3 directly above the ground and 0 9 m p m 3 at a 80 m height 37 which can be justified by the difference in density between np mps and the air leading to settling in the absence of wind 31 42 the concentration of np mps has been revealed to reach 5 4 m p m 3 in indoor conditions 44 and lower values about 1 m p m 3 outdoors 33 37 44 since dilution may occur in open areas a thermal manikin was used to mimic the breathing mechanism through alternate pumping of the ambient air and estimated that 9 3 mps were inhaled for each cubic meter of air inhaled by a human being in his apartment for 24 h 45 furthermore it has been roughly calculated that 21 Î¼m sized pieces of plastic were inhaled every day by shanghai citizens 37 although most of the particles should be removed through mucociliary clearance 5 46 some may reach deep lungs and cause damage such as inflammation fibrosis and cancer 11 28 thus the focus has turned to the assessment of the toxicity of airborne np mps of both synthetic and natural fibres 43 an interesting area of research unexplored to date should also focus on np mps released by face masks and other personal breathing apparatus although face masks are designed to protect operators from external particulate intake the degradation over time of the fibres composing the active part of the masks may lead to consequent release of materials directly into the respiratory system the assessment of such release would be relevant to the general public health especially during pandemic times such as experienced with the covid 19 episode more and more data are available for the evaluation of airborne np mps but care should be taken when comparing raw data since the methodology for np mps counting may vary from one study to another table s1 2 1 2 occurrence and abundance the intrinsic physical properties of the particles such as their density size and shape may dictate their air transfer 36 47 throughout literature fibres have been identified as the predominant shape of airborne mps followed by granules and sheets table s1 5 48 and such fibre shapes have been particularly investigated to date 43 44 49 airborne particles not only comprise of synthetic particles but can also contain inorganic matter such as clay 50 organic cellulosic or proteinaceous materials 45 as well as natural fibres such as cotton or wool 44 and regenerated rayon fibres 43 both natural and regenerated fibres often represented substantial amounts of airborne particles with for instance in a parisian apartment france where only 33 of the fibres were synthetic 44 or in the streets of dongguan china where 73 of the reported particles corresponded to cellulose based materials 51 deposition rates along one of the catchments of the river trent in the uk were on average 1 8 m p m 2 day 1 for extruded fibres including synthetic and regenerated fibres and 128 4 m p m 2 day 1 for natural fibres thus demonstrating the predominance of natural components in certain areas 43 among reported polymers poly ester poly propylene pp and poly ethylene pe have been commonly found but large variations from place to place exist 5 for example pe and ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer represented respectively 48 8 and 22 of the np mps count in hamburg germany 52 whereas poly styrene ps 41 and pe 32 were predominant in a remote pyrenean mountain in france 31 the abundance of airborne np mps may also depend on external parameters such as the proximity from anthropogenic areas 37 49 height from the ground 51 precipitation events 31 44 or direction and strength of the wind 33 52 densely populated areas represent point sources for np mps pollution compared to sparsely inhabited locations thus could incur higher amounts of airborne np mps as reported for the city of paris where the deposition rate of np mps was around 110 m p m 2 day 1 in an urban zone and about 53 m p m 2 day 1 in the suburbs 49 a deposition rate of about 365 m p m 2 day 1 in a remote mountain of the pyrenees france was reported 31 which is higher than the deposition rates within large cities such as hamburg 275 m p m 2 day 1 52 or dongguan up to 43 m p m 2 day 1 51 this finding highlights the importance of wind mediated transport of plastics towards preserved natural habitats as well as the possibility to link plastic pollution and wind direction 37 42 2 1 3 sampling procedures airborne sampling has primarily been performed through three distinct methodologies namely active collection passive collection and dust sampling 5 53 active sampling collects suspended particles by pumping a known volume of air through a filter over a defined duration 33 37 44 the main advantages of this technique are related to the high level of reproducibility since the operating parameters such as the air flow rate volume sampled and pore size of the filters can be specifically selected 5 the possibility to capture all suspended particles in the surrounding environment also ensures a complete validation of the fractions present in the system nonetheless the nominal pore size of the filters will have an influence on the np mps recovery and to date the lowest pore size reported was 0 45 Î¼m 45 passive collection determines the atmospheric fallouts of airborne particles by retaining falling particles in a recipient mounted with a funnel of known opening surface area 31 44 48 49 51 52 passive sampling has been preferred in fieldwork since it does not require maintenance and energy supply thus can be conveniently applied to urban and remote areas 31 however the settling velocity of particles depends on their physico chemical properties where the heaviest and largest particles reach the sampling unit faster consequently care must be taken during the elaboration of sampling protocols to enable appropriate and statistically relevant extraction most sampling surveys span over several periods ranging from days to months 31 44 and methodological study focusing on the sampling duration has not been performed 54 single use plastic items can serve this purpose and to date only sweeping with hog bristle brushes 33 34 and vacuuming with a vacuum cleaner 44 have been utilised particles which settle rapidly might therefore be overrepresented and differences between soil based and airborne np mps becomes less pre eminent due to large changes in medium density 33 34 44 the collection of dust may therefore become problematic to evaluate the specific contribution of airflows to np mps life cycles and distributions across large areas 2 1 4 nano and micro plastic extraction airborne np mps counting and identification requires multiple steps for separating the particles from the matrix concentrating the analyte of interest or removing organic and inorganic matter that could interfere in the characterisation of np mps with outdoor sampling weather events such as rain or gusts can spread and dilute the particles supporting their diffusion into aqueous systems in this scenario researchers have coined the term wet deposition as opposite to dry deposition that describes sampling in the absence of precipitation episodes 47 filtration has been applied to separate the liquid and solid content of the samples but the efficiency of this step profoundly depends on the pore size of the membrane used since this would define the smallest size of particle that can be retrieved 31 the counting of plastic particles in such configuration is challenging and typically performed with particle counters which may partially or entirely overlook the smallest fraction nps that is believed to represent the majority in the number of plastic particles present in the environment 22 55 these particle counters are based on either optical detection of particulate matter or capacitive detection through narrow channels diffusion and are designed as well as calibrated for narrow size distribution particle targets these techniques would also not allow for materials selection accounting for other types of natural or inorganic materials counting adding noise to any analysis organic matter present in airborne samples has been eliminated with the use of strong oxidants such as h2o2 31 33 and naclo 52 but organic digestion has not been routinely implemented due to the low content of natural particles present compared to other media such as water and soil this limited concentration renders the discrimination of np mps from organic compounds manageable 37 45 furthermore the scope of the research may also justify not applying organic digestion as some may want to observe the relative prevalence of fibrous np mps vs natural fibres which could not be attained by such treatments 43 45 the removal of inorganic compounds was performed with density based separation processes using saturated solutions of inorganic salts such as nai density 1 6 g cm 3 33 and zncl2 density 1 6 g cm 3 31 34 44 table s1 the extent to which the extraction of np mps is to be performed mostly depends on the sensitivity of the characterisation techniques applied which will be further critically discussed in this review 53 airborne np mps could represent an underestimated pathway for np mps to reach the environment further research toward a comprehensive evaluation of the global quantity of np mps present in the air and the interactions between the air and other compartments would be required to understand the life cycle of np mps research investigating the occurrence of np mps in the air is still lacking adequate sampling pre treatment and analysis procedure harmonisation although recent progress has been made towards uniformity 5 56 a standardised protocol 56 has been proposed to comply with short time requirements complete study lasting for about 11 days reduced risks of contamination high recovery of np mps 94 4 recovery rate of spiked synthetic fibres and fragments and availability of analysis equipment 56 the lack of systematic approaches for such analyses represents a major hindrance to the detection of airborne np mps studies on np mps should focus on strategies offering the most appropriate protocols to their purpose and therefore consider carefully i the air sampling methodology ii the extraction of np mps and iii their characterisation techniques although active sampling appears to be ideal to ensure statistical representation such technique may be strongly influenced by the sampler height as well as the duration of the sampling process no study demonstrated to date the influence of these parameters on the np mps collection efficiency 44 45 the extraction of np mps is matrix dependent and the distinction between synthetic and natural materials especially fibres can be challenging criteria based on morphological features exist but further exploration towards selective dying of either naturally occurring particles 57 or np mps should be systematically done unless chemical analysis is otherwise performed 2 2 soil and sludge contamination soils and ground based media represent complex mixtures of solids whether organic or mineral and liquids 27 with organic contents varying from 0 02 wt for desert soils to almost 100 wt as in the case of bogs or surface litters 58 the interactions between minerals and organic compounds present within soils can lead to the stabilisation and persistence of toxic compounds over tens to hundreds of years 59 consequently underground plastic items may not undergo biodegradation unless specific plastic degrading bacteria are present 27 and thus could remain unaltered for many years as demonstrated for pp pvc and urea formaldehyde resins that were found unchanged after 32 years of burial in a japanese garden soil 60 2 2 1 sources of pollution soils and sludge since most human activities occur in land and on shore the risk of direct contamination of soils is high np mps present in soils can originate from agricultural practices such as the use of plastic mulching for crop improvements 61 biosolids spreading 24 62 63 irrigation with untreated or partially treated wastewater 64 65 but also from atmospheric inputs 5 66 lake water flooding 66 and landfill leachate 67 the process of covering a soil with a thin plastic film for increased yield and improved crop quality is named mulching 61 the application of mulching films generates a micro environment ideal for the growth of agricultural products e g increased temperature evaporation prevention 61 but benefits have been discussed since it was reported to deplete soil nutrients due to enhanced microbial activity 68 between 1991 and 2004 china has increased the soils covered with mulching films at a growth rate of 30 per year 69 which inevitably participated in the production of land based mps most of mulching films are made of pe or variants where pe is blended with other polymers but none of them has been reported to be fully biodegradable 61 mp concentration has been found to be positively correlated with the duration of mulching practice on agricultural soils with concentrations of about 80 m p kgdry solid 1 for 5 years of continuous mulching and 1076 m p kgdry solid 1 for a soil treated for 24 years 70 biosolids usage may represent the primary source of np mps in terrestrial ecosystems since waste water treatment plants wwtps concentrate plastic particles in the sludge 24 63 in 2019 3 7 mton of dry solids were produced by australian wwtps from which 67 was used for landfilling application 71 np mps in sewage sludge were also documented as high as 15 385 particles kgdry solid 1 72 which could subsequently lead to an annual input of about 3 8 1012 mps the direct input of contaminated sludge with a mp concentration of 45 5 g kgdry solid 1 was tested on a sampled soil the concentration of mps in the soil progressively increased after each sludge deposition cycle starting from 1 37 g kgdry solid 1 after one sludge application to end up with 4 38 g kgdry solid 1 after 5 cycles 63 besides between 4 1 and 13 1011 mps have been estimated to be introduced in agricultural soils of ontario each year due to the use of biosolids 73 such discoveries may question on the benefits of sludge application and regulations regarding the acceptable quantity of np mps present in biosolids could be expected in the foreseeable future 2 2 2 nano and micro plastic migration soils np mps entrapped in soils may not be static and may migrate horizontally or vertically depending on the surrounding ecosystem due to airborne or water based oceanic or river based currents requiring gradient of sampling to assess occurrence and contamination levels properly living organisms thriving and moving in soils can participate in the propagation of np mps through bioturbation 58 that includes ingestion and egestion digging burrows that could act as water channels for np mps displacement or particles stuck to living organisms 74 75 the influence of earthworms on the migration of plastic particles 76 78 was observed and found that earthworms were able to move pe beads ranging from 710 to 2800 Î¼m down to 10 cm within 21 days in a loamy soil 77 other organisms such as gophers and moles 79 or collembolas 80 may also play a role in the spread of plastic pollution within soils water percolation and leaching through macro and mesopores can also lead to the migration of plastic particles 74 np mps have been reported at concentrations up to 42 960 m p kgdry soil 1 81 with the majority of np mps being pe or pp 66 81 however large variability exists across the literature table s2 which can be explained by the intrinsic complexity of soils and origin of plastics soils remain an overlooked compartment which would deserve more attention especially for the effective detection of sub micron mps and nps 2 2 3 sampling of nano and micro plastics in soils and extraction soil samples are generally obtained via direct bulk sampling of a known mass or volume of matter for further processing but no sampling standardisation exists some research have relied on common tools applied to grounds e g auger corer 63 73 but the specification of the equipment used remains marginal sampling soil may appear to be straightforward but the collection methodology may introduce concentration extrapolation bias 27 depth of collection sampling site proximity from waterways are major parameters that have to be seriously considered prior to sampling to date np mps occurrence has been estimated at different depths but never above the metre scale table s2 since np mps can be relocated in the soil a clear justification of the soil depth and area sampled shall be provided to ensure statistical accuracy of the studies 27 in such circumstances solid expertise in soil geochemistry as well as knowledge of the inhomogeneities in term of composition of the sampling sites are required corer may appear as an appropriate technique to understand vertical distribution of np mps where separation could be achieved according to the soil stratification along the vertical axis rather than through pre selected depths the presence of np mps may then be analysed over the entire soil sample after homogenisation or extraction from selected soil sections such a methodology may provide valuable information on the concentration profiles of np mps along the depth of the corer with the possibility to correlate the migration properties of the particles with solid media characteristics determining the np mp migration rates and properties in ideal porous soil media 82 83 would support environmental sampling to feed theoretical models to better understand the fate of np mps in soils extraction of np mps from soil matrices represents the main challenge faced due to the high quantity of soil organic matter som 74 which shall strongly bind with np mps 27 the separation of np mps from soms and inorganics is commonly made by sequential drying sieving floatation filtration density based separation and finally digestion 27 common studies on soil geochemistry usually apply sieving with 2 mm mesh size but this cut off size is not appropriate to the definition of np mps and smaller sieve sizes shall be considered to discriminate further smaller fractions of materials 58 inorganics have been efficiently separated from np mps by density fractionation with concentrated nacl zncl2 nai solutions table s2 even though sodium polytungstate has been preferred for soil studies it was not applied to np mps extraction from soil matrices 66 soms cannot be completely removed through this technique because their density may generally vary from 1 to 1 4 g cm 3 58 soms are preferably removed via chemical digestion including mostly oxidants e g h2o2 and acids e g hno3 table s2 som removal with h2so4 h2o2 kclo naoh and hno3 were tested for np mps extraction from swiss floodplain soils 66 hno3 was found to yield better som removal with efficient ps pu pet pvc and pe extraction efficiency but resulted in the degradation of poly amide acrylonitrile and butadiene styrene this was considered as satisfactory for the purpose of the study since these components are not predominant in the environment 66 fenton processes were successfully applied in rich organic matrices but operated optimally in a narrow range of operating conditions e g t 40 c and ph 3 which would not be suitable in alkaline calcareous soils 84 alternative extraction methodologies have been successfully applied for retrieving spiked mps from soil samples thus could be applied to field studies total recovery of spiked pe ps pvc pet and pp mps during a 2 stage pressurised fluid extraction was obtained for a glass bead medium and municipal compost after optimisation of the extraction parameters 85 methanol was used to extract the non mp fraction at a temperature of 100 c and dichloromethane heated at 180 c achieved the mp extraction this method is theoretically size independent since plastics are dissolved during extraction which cannot allow the determination of the size distribution without prior fractionation and sieving 85 2 3 occurrence of nano and micro plastics in the aquatic environment the occurrence of np mps in aquatic ecosystems such as oceans rivers and lakes has gained great interest over the past decades to date although a literature is available to assess the occurrence of np mps in freshwater salinity of 0 5 ppt or less the volume of manuscripts for the lakes is limited compared to that of marine environment even though similar methodologies can or have been applied 86 2 3 1 sources of pollution np mps detected in the marine environment originate from fishing and recreational boating 87 88 but also from land based activities which represent up to 98 of plastics found in the oceans 89 91 the fishing industry is under strict regulations stated under the marpol 73 78 convention which prohibited the disposal and abandonment of plastic items including fishing gears and nets at sea 92 93 however challenging and scarce off shore controls as well as accidental releases participate in the plastic load in haline water bodies 23 94 with an estimated input of about 640 000 ton year 1 95 the fragmentation of sampled poly amide 6 pa nets from the venetian lagoon italy in laboratory conditions simulating the marine environment salinity of 30 g l 1 temperature around 15 c and abrasive forces was found to generate 750 microfibres per gram of net after 1 h of immersion 19 land based plastic pollution represents all plastic materials released from in land human activities that end up in seas coastal tourism 96 on shore production sites 97 leaching from landfills 98 as well as riverine import 99 wastewater treatment plants wwtps discharge 100 and atmospheric relocation 5 have been reported as sources of np mps pollution in the marine environment 90 the concentration of np mps was found to be inversely correlated to the distance from the discharge site of treated wastewaters in the helsinki archipelago with a reported concentration of 2 46 m p l 1 at the discharge site while concentrations of 1 74 and 0 51 m p l 1 at distances of 1 2 and 3 3 km from the effluent discharge site were reported respectively 100 rivers may also dramatically increase the amount of np mps flushed to oceans since freshwater media are prone to heavy np mps pollution from human activities including wwtps discharge tyre wear and household dusts to name a few 101 for instance a np mps concentration of 293 m p m 3 was detected upstream a korean river whereas 4760 m p m 3 were detected downstream after passing nearby numerous water treatment facilities 102 transport models have been generated to evaluate the magnitude of this source of pollution and when applied to the rhone river represents 163 tonnes of microplastics transported into the mediterranean sea each year 99 the contamination of freshwater by np mps is often characterised by a proximity to human inhabited regions and human infrastructures which are known to be point sources of np mps emission table s3 the pressure caused by industries and households located near rivers and lakes has been demonstrated in several cases 48 103 104 as an example the rhine river which is a densely populated and highly industrialised european waterway has recorded an average np mps concentration of 892 777 m p km 2 between basel and rotterdam 103 furthermore over 50 of the shapes reported were spherules that are commonly used in the plastic industry for the production of commodity items 2 which aligns with the ubiquity of packaging and office furniture factories along the rhine river 103 104 in remote areas leaching from soils due to agricultural practice such as mulching or sludge spreading 105 roads run off 106 aerial deposition 48 and improper disposal 107 may be the predominant sources of np mps for instance np mps concentration of up to 20 264 m p km 2 were reported in a remote mongolian lake where only small villages were present ashore 107 in that case np mps were attributed to the negligence of local populations who did not have adequate waste management systems in place 107 farming and surface run offs may represent the major pathways for np mps to reach groundwater through diffusion in the soil s micro and meso pores this aspect was confirmed with the observation of np mps with concentrations up to 15 2 m p l 1 in wells and springs sourced from underlying aquifers in the state of illinois usa 108 2 3 2 transport and abundance of nano micro plastics an overview 2 3 2 1 transport of nano microplastics through the water column the physico chemical properties of np mps drive their sedimentation across the water column as well as their horizontal displacement 4 109 most reported np mps in the aquatic environment such as pe pp or ps possess a density lower than that of seawater and similar to that of freshwater 90 110 111 which leads to their accumulation in sub surface water layers 112 more diverse compositions have been noticed in sediments where both heavy and light np mps can accumulate 113 for instance light polymers were detected into the sediments of the elbe river germany with pe ps and pp contributing to the np mps shares of 34 4 18 5 and 12 5 respectively 113 in the same river np mps concentration was found as high as 2 27 107 mp m 3 for sediments and 13 24 m p m 3 for surface water 113 stressing the role of sediments in np mps accumulation in sediments from the arctic ocean np mps pollution was found to reach 68 78 m p kgdry solid 1 with pp representing 51 5 of all np mps due to the impact of biofouling and hetero aggregation on the sinking process 114 such phenomena may lead to a stratification of np mps in the water column and sediments based on the density size shape and residence time of the particles hence the concentration of np mps can hardly be correlated with depth the vertical distribution of np mps in the monterey bay was reported for concentrations of 2 9 m p m 3 15 m p m 3 and 2 9 m p m 3 at depths of 5 m 200 m and 1 000 m respectively 115 heterogeneity in the polymeric materials was observed with pp particles present 25 m below the surface and denser polymers such as poly oxymethylene and poly methyl methacrylate detected at a depth varying from 100 to 600 m particles residing in water columns are prone to major alterations of their initial properties through biofouling and or hetero aggregation with noms reducing their buoyancy over time 4 116 the colonisation of pe packaging by bacteria and molluscs has been observed after only a week of immersion in the plymouth harbour and the materials were found to sink in laboratory settings due to buoyancy reduction after spending three weeks in the harbour 117 although sinking may occur after microbial colonisation the density of attached organisms could diminish as a consequence of diverse hostile mechanisms such as foraging by predatory species or changes in light exposure thus leading to the oscillating upward and downward movements of np mps 118 in a similar fashion hetero aggregation may also take place between np mps and natural organic matter that mainly originates from the decay of aquatic animals or plants as well as secretions of exopolymers by multiple organisms such as bacteria 119 or gastropods 120 this process embeds np mps in a cohesive gel like matrix which can lead to their settlement as demonstrated for ps nano and microspheres with size distributions ranging from 50 to 10 000 nm in the presence of microbial glycoproteins 119 ultimately fouled and denser np mps made of materials such as pet pvc pu or alkyd 4 would reach the seabed quickly where they can be incorporated into the benthic ecosystem until perturbed or stressed by external stimuli the diversity of np mps shapes detected in the aquatic environment such as fibres or fibre fractions spherical fragments likely from the wear of other materials and thin films generated from packaging table s4 can also impact the particle behaviour in the water column materials with similar chemistry and volume may settle and disperse with different velocities according to their shapes and hydrodynamic properties 18 for instance experimental and theoretical approaches have shown that cylindrical particles were subject to oscillation and rotation which induced a non linear settling trajectory as compared to their spherical counterpart 121 2 3 2 2 horizontal displacement of nano micro plastics np mps abundance in the aquatic environment can also be impacted by the horizontal transport of np mps due to water streams the aquatic environment is generally characterised by a strong dynamic nature with advective phenomena such as currents waves tidal regimes or thermohaline gradients 89 which subsequently participate in the worldwide spread of np mps even remote oceans such as the arctic ocean where np mps have been detected from both the surface waters 18 m p m 3 and the ice cores 2 17 mp l 1 are no longer free from np mps 122 ice drifts travelling from the siberian shelves to the western arctic and the central arctic were hypothesised to be the cause for np mps detected in this area multiple models were developed to explain the dynamics of oceans and have been applied to np mps pollution in order to explain their dispersion patterns 123 124 floating and submerged np mps may not be subject to the same type of dynamics which could lead to drastically different patterns along the world s oceans modelling based on well established oceanic mechanisms has shown that the migration of np mps towards subtropical and subpolar regions was stronger for np mps deeper in water streams compared to sub surface debris 125 nonetheless more data is still required for swathes of the open ocean southern hemisphere equatorial regions and coastal waters to obtain reliable models fitting with field measurements 25 shores and beaches represent a clear border between land based and pelagic np mps and the extent to which plastics are transferred from one medium to the other is yet to be fully assessed high concentrations of np mps up to 285 673 m p m 2 were obtained for coastal sediments where most np mps were composed of expanded ps which is the main component of on shore buoys 126 thus tides may also deposit np mps produced offshore onto coastal lands in addition to the dynamic of water currents man made water constructions as well as weather events can also contribute to the distribution of np mps in the aquatic environment specifically in freshwaters the influence of dams on np mps distribution was investigated with six reservoirs located near ithaca in new york by comparing np mps concentrations upstream at the reservoirs and downstream 127 five of the six barrages followed a consistent pattern with higher surface np mps concentrations upstream than at the reservoir site an inverse trend was reported in that same study as expected for the concentration of np mps in the corresponding sediments specifically striking results were found for a dam located in the fall creek usa with surface np mps concentrations of 25 m p l 1 upstream and about 8 m p l 1 at the reservoir site while 100 m p kgdry solid 1 and around 220 m p kgdry solid 1 were detected in the upstream and reservoir sediments respectively 127 a study performed in the lake donghu in china showed that peaks in np mps occurrence appeared during heavy rainfall with np mps concentrations reaching 30 m p l 1 compared to 12 m p l 1 one day before the authors were able to describe a linear correlation between the increase of np mps occurrence and rainfall 128 rainfall and storms may promote urban and agricultural run off thus facilitating the transport of np mps from lands to different water bodies 128 129 furthermore the storms and precipitations may also strengthen the hydrodynamic conditions of shallow water bodies where the re suspension of sediments may occur 86 129 np mps initially entrapped in sediments may be dispersed in the water column due to the storm action thus artificially increasing the concentration of np mps in the freshwater system even though only an exchange between sediments and water may be responsible for this trend previously the effect of biofouling on vertical transport has been mentioned but higher trophic levels organisms may also participate in the relocation of np mps in both the water body and sediments representative examples include the consumption of np mps by zooplankton which will participate in the spread of materials through defecation 130 or subsequent ingestion by predatory species the overall dynamic of np mps migration in the aquatic environment is complex and more research dedicated to this area is to be performed 2 3 3 sampling procedures the capture of np mps from the aquatic environment can be performed in the water body in the sediments and on shores where tidal events may induce continual exchange between water and coastal lands to date three methodologies have been developed for collecting np mps from these media including i selective sampling ii bulk sampling and iii volume reduced sampling 4 23 selective sampling corresponds to the direct extraction of np mps from the medium by visual monitoring of the area scanned beaches and to lesser extent surface waters are more suitable for this technique although the scientific pertinence of the approach may be debated 4 low accuracy as well as high risks of misidentification or overlooking of smaller np mps smaller than 1 mm however limit the applicability of this technique nonetheless it may represent an opportunity to raise public awareness of plastic pollution through sampling sessions including non scientific operators 131 citizen science combined with proper standard operating procedures may also help to source and monitoring plastic pollution cost effectively in multiple locations 132 bulk sampling collects the entire matrix components without any separation of the constituents of the sample the yield of np mps extraction may become the limiting step since contamination can be introduced by the capture technique the finite size of the container such as 10 l for water matrices may lead to poor statistics for representing broad areas of interest 4 133 bulk sampling in a 5 l hull and reduced volume sampling manta trawl was compared in the baltic sea where the concentration of np mps was found to be 1030 m p m 3 with bulk sampling whereas it was 0 07 m p m 3 with manta trawls 134 the sampling of sediments primarily follows this methodology with specific equipment lowered to the seabed such as corer and van veen grab which may sample precise volumes of sediments 4 135 volume reduced sampling where only the fraction of interest is conserved represents the most applied sampling technique for water sampling this technique relies on the use of trawls e g manta bongo plankton nets which are towed over a transect using fine meshes with typical sizes of 300 330 Î¼m 133 unlike for bulk sampling large volumes of water can be sampled but the lower limit of np mps that can be detected by this technique is determined by the size of the mesh used furthermore overlooking the smallest fraction of np mps may drastically modify the concentration measured a study comparing the occurrence of np mps in subtropical gyres of the northern hemisphere by using trawls with mesh sizes of 100 333 and 500 Î¼m showed that for the 100 Î¼m mesh the np mps concentration was 2 5 and 10 fold greater than that of the 333 and 500 Î¼m meshes respectively 25 although large mesh nets overlook the smaller fraction of np mps fine mesh with pore sizes between 50 and 100 Î¼m may capture them at the expense of clogging and fouling limiting the water influx a compromise between the number of particles retained and the output of the technique and statistical representativeness of the water body must be found in that case the fast clogging of a 100 Î¼m net in japanese rivers supported the shift towards nets with mesh sizes of 335 Î¼m used for durations of 5 30 min 111 clogging may be a more important issue for eutrophic lakes and the sampling methodology would have to be adapted accordingly by for instance implementing larger mesh size shorter sampling durations and consecutive filtration through different sieves another volume reduced approach consists of filtering water samples through one or consecutive filters to analyse large volumes as well as limiting clogging some freshwater streams with strong unidirectional advective flows such as rivers may avoid the use of a motorised vehicle during the sampling campaign 111 although volume reduced approaches have been favoured in field studies to sample surface or sub surface np mps bulk sampling draws the benefit of versatility with the possibility to sample np mps in shallow waterways 105 alternative approaches have been developed to assess np mps prevalence deeper in the water column as an example a remotely operated vehicle pumping water through a filter was used to monitor np mps concentration for depths as deep as 1000 m 115 2 3 4 extraction procedures extraction protocols of np mps from sampled matrices are system dependent and are selected according to the sensitivity of the characterisation techniques used the marine environment has been the first target for assessing the prevalence of mps thus more accurate detection and separation protocols have been developed for plastic particles 4 np mps detection protocols evolved from simple procedures such as filtration directly followed by microscopy to elaborated protocols for the removal of organic and inorganic compounds that may disturb the identification sediments and beach samples are typical media that require the removal of natural material for retrieving and characterising plastic particles 90 most np mps have a density ranging from 0 8 to 1 4 g cm 3 so that density separation using salts with densities higher than 1 4 g cm 3 should be used to retrieve particles from aqueous matrices and sediments that have an average density of 2 65 g cm 3 136 various brine solutions have been proposed such as saturated nai nacl sodium polytungstate and zncl2 137 the recovery of mps with different chemistry e g pp ps and pvc was found to be positively correlated with the density of the salt solution used in this study znbr2 at 25 of saturation d 1 71 g cm 3 appeared to be the best choice for mp extraction from sediments saturated nai solutions have often been prioritised due to economic and environmental reasons but can also react with starch based filters and hamper np mps identification 136 aqueous samples are less impacted by the presence of inorganics because of their long residence time in the water body that allowed them to settle nonetheless organic materials may be abundant in such matrices especially after volume reduced sampling where large volumes of water samples may have concentrated both np mps and natural organic matter 138 to date no standard protocol has been developed for the digestion of organic matter where chemical degradation e g h2o2 fenton s reagent hcl naoh and naclo as well as enzymatic digestion e g proteinase cellulose lipase chitinase have been used 139 the digestive step must i degrade contaminants ii be time and cost efficient and iii not alter the morphology and size distribution of np mps 133 fenton s reagent has been found to provide a mild oxidative environment that achieved efficient degradation without damaging mp particles 84 besides enzymes achieve excellent np mps extraction and digestion with proteinase k was found to conserve the initial aggregation state of nano sized plastic particles whereas aggregation was observed after acidic treatment 140 although largely overlooked aggregation is a key parameter determining the toxicity of a contaminant and critical analysis of the effect of separation steps on the particles should be more regularly performed nonetheless enzymatic digestion is expensive and not all laboratories have available enzymes thus conventional oxidation approaches with h2o2 have been favoured table s3 and s4 alternative extraction procedures have been successfully applied for separating np mps from both the water column and sediments methodologies based on the hydrophobic affinity between mps and oleic mixtures have shown remarkable recovery yields for large np mps the efficiency of a novel separation method using castor oil for mps ranging from 300 to 1000 Î¼m was recently demonstrated the recovery of mps pp ps and pmma spiked into sediment and soil matrices was achieved up to 99 even though high organic matter content may be responsible for poor recovery digestion cannot be avoided and represents one of the most efficient alternatives to density based separation techniques 141 3 synthetic nano micro plastics utilisation or generation parametric studies to investigate np mps chemical and physical properties require model np mps particles to mimic the size shape and composition of np mps commonly found in the environment this section summarises the existing strategies to generate model np mps for laboratory work and discusses the suitability of each approach based on the study needs fig 1 3 1 purchase of off the shelf nano and micro plastics off the shelf products are among the most convenient ways to obtain pure and ready to use mps most studies involving the use of spherical np mps source their material from microbeads mbs manufacturers 65 142 148 which can supply mb samples made of ps pe or pmma with a size ranging from 0 02 7000 Î¼m table s5 mbs with narrow size distributions with less than 5 or 10 beyond the specified size range are usually sold by manufacturers fig 2 a and b 149 154 other physicochemical properties such as fluorescence colour and surface functionality can be tuned commercially to meet the requirements of specific investigations such as analytical and biological studies 150 153 154 commercial mbs have been extensively used in studies investigating the toxicity of np mps on aquatic species 65 146 148 155 156 since it was reported that up to 8 billion mbs can be released per day in the environment 157 most biological assays focusing on np mps ingestion use ps fluorescent or coloured mbs that can be easily identified within the tissue and organs of the organisms 65 146 148 although pe is one of the main np mps constituents a lower number of experiments has been conducted with pe mbs compared to with ps 144 158 this is probably because ps mbs are a common standard for instrument and process standardisation and therefore most manufacturers offer a wider range of ps mbs than pe table s5 although chemical manufacturers produce bulk volumes of ps and pe mbs for diverse industries such as civil engineering formulations and coatings purchasing small quantities of mbs for research purpose is often challenging although mbs have been used for a long time in np mps studies their use is typically limited to simple spherical models while a growing number of reports on the occurrence of np mps in natural environments are now demonstrating the presence of more complex shapes including irregular flat and fibrous np mps of various sizes micrometre sized plastic sheets and fibres such as metallized poly ethylene terephthalate pet glitter 159 and precision cut microfibres 160 are also available the diversity in terms of size and composition of these materials is however limited and may not reflect materials found in ecosystems alternative routes to synthesise np mps of controlled composition shape and size are therefore required 3 2 extraction of nano and micro plastics from commercial products daily life products such as cosmetics and textiles represent up to 37 of all np mps found in oceans 161 extracting np mps contained in these items is a low cost solution used to source realistic np mps that would have been released in the environment tables s6 s7 and s8 3 2 1 beads and fragments plastic mbs have been deliberately used in personal care products as exfoliators or fillers at concentrations up to 10 wt 162 making rinse off cosmetics a cost effective way of recovering mbs for lab work purpose most common procedures involve the use of hot water to dissolve the product matrix before filtrating mbs through a series of filters ranging from 2 5 50 Î¼m 162 168 table s6 a wide variety of mbs can be found in personal care products including those with a smooth or rough surface 29 163 164 and those containing additives such as tio2 164 or al2o3 whiteners 29 surface roughness can be altered during the manufacturing processes of the mbs and the cosmetic product therefore mbs extracted from diverse products can display various surface roughness 29 163 164 interestingly most mbs extracted from cosmetic products are made of pe 162 164 167 which largely contribute to np mps pollution along with ps 169 although pe mbs can be purchased from dedicated manufacturers table s5 personal care products constitute a complementary method to source pe mbs unexpectedly most mbs found in cosmetic products are of irregular shape and size ranging from the nanoscale 9 170 across the microscale 168 171 and up to the milliscale 29 172 173 fig 1 c and d although large particles have been easily identified as broken mbs 163 granules 165 or threads 163 166 173 nanosized fragments are more complex to characterise 9 170 pe fragments smaller than 0 1 Î¼m were collected in facial scrubs through filtration with 0 1 and 0 2 Î¼m filters followed by high resolution sem imaging 9 170 mps released in the environment can easily break down into hazardous nps increasing their number concentration by ten folds upon fragmentation following a crack propagation and failure mechanism 9 nps are of growing interest due to their unique colloidal properties nevertheless no manufacturers offer ready to use nanosized plastic fragments to date nps found in facial scrubs represent up to 3 4 wt of the product 170 hence sourcing nps from cosmetic products appears to be a relevant alternative 3 2 2 fibres synthetic textile fibres are estimated to constitute up to 35 wt of all primary plastic debris found in oceans 161 amongst which poly ester fibres constitute the most abundant fraction 49 174 175 microplastic fibres mfs detected in the environment mainly originate from laundry whereby over 6 000 000 textile fibres from a single 5 kg load wash may be released 16 this concentration represents less than 0 03 wt of the wash 16 although a growing number of studies are now focusing on synthetic fibres and several research groups have sourced their model np mps materials from washing machine effluents by recovering the fibres shedding from the fabrics 176 177 however the size desired number and composition of the recovered fibres largely depend on the type of fabric used and on the laundry conditions 20 poly ester mfs shedding from garments can vary from hundreds of microns 16 177 to a few millimetres 20 178 in length for an average of 15 Î¼m 16 20 176 178 although the fibre length can be impacted by the type of yarn used and whether the garment may be manufactured with continuous or staple fibres mfs with a broad length distribution can still shed from the same garment resulting in polydispersed samples 178 the number of fibres shed from a piece of fabric can also be impacted by the type of sewing and the amount and type of detergents 16 a poly ester woven fabric made of multiple yarns can release 3 5 million fibres per kg of fabric whereas a poly ester knitted fabric made of a single yarn releases less than 2 million fibres in similar washing conditions 16 the use of liquid and powder detergents can also dramatically enhance fibres shedding by 8 and 20 times respectively 16 table s7 3 2 3 sheets although the presence of flat plastic particles in the environment has been previously reported 174 179 180 the contribution of these micrometre sized plastic sheets to np mps pollution remains unknown due to a lack of experimental data mp sheets originate from various sources such as paint and film packaging but also from glitter 181 which can be used as model particles for studies investigating the impact of mp sheets on the environment glitter can be extracted from cosmetic products such as facial scrub 163 or nail polish which have been found to contain glitter particles 50 75 Î¼m large and 20 Î¼m thick 182 most glitter particles are made of pet covered by a metallic layer providing reflective properties to the particles 182 this layer can be removed by mild acidic treatments 181 to obtain neat pet flat sheet particles modelling regular flat mps found in the environment table s8 extracting glitter from cosmetic products has the advantage of yielding np mps with a more complex mechanical history than ready to use glitter nevertheless other routes can be followed to generate more relevant np mps sheets such as irregular flat fragments released from plastic bags or packaging 183 184 3 3 sourcing of model nano and micro plastics via top down and bottom up approaches 3 3 1 top down approaches secondary np mps can be artificially generated via a top down approach by mechanically breaking down plastic pellets or daily life plastic products such as coffee cup lids textile fabric and plastic bags tables s9 s10 and s11 the purpose of this process is to quickly generate np mps from various materials to represent those in the environment 3 3 1 1 fragments lab scale milling systems have been predominantly used to break large plastic items into np mps ranging from 7 to 1000 Î¼m 185 190 in some cases plastic items are frozen into liquid nitrogen to stiffen the plastic material and facilitate their fragmentation before being milled 188 186 190 liquid nitrogen is used at temperatures ranging between 210 and 196 c which is lower than the glass transition of common polymer materials such as pe pet and ps plastic pieces become brittle when in contact with liquid nitrogen which facilitates the shattering of the larger plastic items during the grinding process leading to np mps although other lab scale systems have generated np mps using equipment such as high power horn sonication 9 and torque rheometry 191 these specific devices are not readily available in all lab facilities household appliances such as kitchen blenders are a cost effective alternative to obtain np mps fragments ranging from 0 1 up to 1000 Î¼m 145 189 190 192 liquid nitrogen cannot be used within these devices but plastic pieces can be frozen in liquid nitrogen first and then ground with ice to keep a low grinding temperature and increase the brittleness of the plastic material 189 although the energy given to the raw plastic material can be controlled its bulk mechanical properties are usually not homogenous due to the manufacturing process and use of the product 2 plastic based everyday life products were exposed to thermal and mechanical stress during their manufacturing process such as extrusion and blow moulding which can result in crazing a phenomenon responsible for the formation of localised microvoids on the glassy areas of a plastic material 193 these voids eventually develop into cracks leading to material failure under sufficient energy load such as during grinding 193 a wide distribution of np mps fragments is therefore commonly obtained upon grinding depending on the size and manufacturing history of the original plastic pieces used the type of plastic material and whether milling systems or kitchen blenders are used fig 2 e and f ground np mps are filtered through sieves 185 188 189 192 194 and filters 145 191 to separate np mps into fractions that can be used further depending on the investigation requirements table s9 3 3 1 2 fibres synthetic microfibres can be recovered by cutting and grinding fibrous materials such as textile fabric 195 197 ropes 198 199 and filaments 191 200 table s10 although cutting with sharp scissors and grinding can yield fibres down to 30 Î¼m in length 197 198 fibres larger than 1 mm are also generated within the same samples 195 196 the polydispersed samples can be used as such 196 197 or sieved into fractions to investigate specific length ranges 198 although the lack of accuracy of grinding and hand cutting techniques prevents the generation of controlled length distribution of microfibres cryogenic techniques such as cryo microtoming can address this issue by providing a well controlled cutting step fig 2 a and b cryostat microtomes are heavily used in the biological field to prepare frozen sections of organic tissue for microscopic analysis 201 tissues are embedded in a freezing agent before sections are cut at a thickness down to 5 Î¼m at a temperature between 20 and 80 c 201 a similar procedure was recently designed to cut microfibres from pet pa and pp poly filaments producing almost 60 000 fibres smaller than 50 Î¼m in length from a 3 m long filament within 1 h 200 a standard length variation smaller than 15 Î¼m can be obtained with this versatile method which can generate a wide range of cut fibres with a narrow size distribution 191 200 3 3 1 3 sheets flat microplastic fragments have recently become of interest since the fragmentation of single use plastic carrier bags into np mps have been reported in air soil and water ecosystems 202 although mono dispersed samples of np mps sheets can be purchased as glitter irregularly shaped sheets as found in the environment can only be generated via a top down grinding approach resulting in a board size distribution fig 3 c and d single use carrier bags have been used to generate model np mps sheets by grinding pieces into 60 600 Î¼m large irregular flat fragments by mimicking plastic bags breakage occurring in the environment 203 np mps sheets can also be sourced from ground daily life products such as gloves balloons food packaging and inflatable toys 204 205 plastic bags are complex to break down due to their flexibility nonetheless liquid nitrogen can be used to facilitate the grinding process and enhance the release of np mps 204 poly ester films used as cling wrap document sleeves or labels could also be milled or cut to generate np mps flat fragments however such method has not been reported to date sourcing model np mps fragments fibres and sheets can be done by grinding or cutting large plastic pieces either with sophisticated techniques such as cryo sectioning or simply by using a kitchen blender table s11 to date none of the top down techniques presented in this section successfully produced a suitable quantity of np mps with a monodisperse or narrow size distribution which could be useful when comparing the impact of the size of np mps on the environment 3 3 2 bottom up approaches controlling the size distribution of artificially generated np mps is a major challenge that can be tackled with bottom up techniques laboratory synthesis of nano microbeads and nano microfibres using radical polymerization and spinning techniques respectively can be performed down to the nanoscale with a controlled dispersity tables s12 and s13 3 3 2 1 beads monodisperse ps beads can be fabricated by emulsion 206 208 or dispersion 209 211 polymerisation table s12 both processes are complementary since emulsion polymerisation typically yields beads from 30 to 500 nm in diameter while dispersion polymerisation produces beads within the range of 1 15 Î¼m 212 this size difference is due to the polymerisation mechanism induced by each technique whereby monomers are either soluble or insoluble in the continuous phase of the dispersion or emulsion process respectively 212 although optional divinylbenzene is commonly used as a crosslinker during the polymerization of styrene to enhance the mechanical properties of the formed beads 206 210 213 emulsifiers and stabilizers such as sodium dodecyl sulphate and poly vinyl pyrrolidone are required during most emulsion and dispersion polymerizations respectively to stabilize the particles and prevent them from agglomerating 212 beads are eventually separated from the solution once the reaction is over by successive precipitation or centrifugation 209 ps nano and microbeads may be produced by radical polymerization under mild conditions whereas pe polymerization requires high temperature or pressure to be conducted 214 215 synthesizing monodisperse nano and microbeads by radical polymerization is quick but requires specific equipment chemicals and knowledge to be performed unless pe beads with a specific surface chemistry are required ps polymerization seems the most convenient strategy to self generate model mp beads fig 2 g and h 3 3 2 2 fibres pp pet and pa are amongst the most abundant synthetic np mps fibres found in the environment and mainly originate from synthetic textiles marine ropes and nets 49 174 216 fibres with diameters down to the micrometre range are produced via conventional spinning techniques such as wet and melt spinning while smaller diameters are obtained via electrospinning 217 a wide range of fibre compositions and diameters can be obtained by tuning the parameters of each technique table s13 poly olefin poly ester and pa fibres have been long produced via melt spinning which only requires to melt the polymer extrude it and draw it to obtain microfibres from 10 to 100 Î¼m in diameter 218 220 the melt spinning process can quickly yield large amount of fibres collected on a roller nevertheless this technique is energy consuming since raw polymers need to be heated above their melting point to be extruded diameters below 5 Î¼m cannot be obtained by melt spinning but can be reached by electrospinning which can generate pet and pa nanofibers down to 255 and 60 nm respectively at ambient temperature 221 222 electrospinning is an effective method to produce nanofibers by applying an electrostatic field to a polymer solution 223 224 pp nanofibers are more difficult to obtain by electrospinning since hazardous solvents and elevated temperatures are required to dissolve pp this issue has been addressed by adding surfactants to molten pp prior to being extruded during melt spinning which significantly reduces pp spun fibres diameter down to 400 nm 225 melt electrospinning writing can alternatively be performed to yield fibres with a sub micron diameter 226 virgin plastic pellets are commonly used as raw materials to generate spun nano and microfibres as well as recycled plastic waste 219 which can be processed under similar conditions as opposed to beads which are ready to be used after fabrication spun fibres generated as a fibrous mat require an additional cutting or grinding step to yield fibres with a specific length as described in section 1 3 1 2 aligned fibres can be specifically processed by electrospinning 221 to be subsequently sectioned with a cryostat at a controlled length and generate a more narrow size distribution 200 fibres cryo sectioning can only be conducted with a cryostat and requires more preparation and optimization time than other top down procedures which limits its use to specific investigations where the fibre length distribution must be narrow spinning techniques are a convenient way to tune model nano and microfibres according to specific needs however these processes demand a strong expertise and appropriate equipment to be successfully conducted 3 3 2 3 sheets stretch films and plastic bags are usually processed by blown film extrusion which can draw films made of diverse polymers such as pe pp and ps 227 lab scale blown film extruders could be used to consistently generate a thin pe pp or ps film with controlled composition and thickness subsequently cut or ground to generate model np mps sheets alternatively molecular templates could be used to generate ultrathin np mps films as previously performed with graphene sheets to design ultra flat organic films 228 unlike polymerisation and spinning techniques no bottom up method has been used to source np mps sheets to date main limitations are due to the equipment expertise and time required to yield a suitable amount of sample which render model np mps sheets more complex to obtain via a bottom up approach than beads and fibres 3 4 limitations of sourcing model nano and micro plastics model np mps must meet specific requirements regarding their shape size and size distribution while being representative of real np mps as detected in the environment a wide variety of well controlled shapes can be obtained via the four sourcing routes presented in this work table 1 nevertheless controlling the size and size distribution of irregular np mps remains a major challenge model np mps fragments can be either extracted from daily life products or generated via top down techniques nonetheless these methods yield polydispersed np mps samples which are not suitable for studies requiring a narrow dispersity table 1 although sieving solutions have been developed to reduce the polydispersity of such samples 191 sub micron np mps are usually missed due to the minimum mesh or pore size of the sieves and filters used a potential alternative would be to perform field flow fractionation fff to separate np mps into fractions from 50 Î¼m down to few nanometers in size 229 230 the buoyancy of most np mps allows them to be easily suspended in water which would facilitate their separation by fff uv and dls detectors could be combined with the fff system to assess the concentration and particle size of the np mps fractions directly and therefore generate ready to use suspensions of np mps at a controlled size and concentration although fff can separate mps as small as 10 nm and generate fractions of nps particles at a flow rate up to 10 ml min 1 229 230 the initial sample must contain enough nps to achieve nps concentrations suitable for further investigation in a reasonable amount of time concentrated suspensions or powder samples of spherical nps can be purchased or fabricated at a lab scale nevertheless these nps beads are less relevant when it comes to mimicking real nps samples since presenting significantly fewer effects on their surface fig 2a and b nps identification within environmental samples is challenging due to the complexity of soil and water matrices hence the generation of nps in the environment is still not well understood 231 this research gap has impeded progress on the development of model nps sourcing methods which are not well controlled yet developing a combination of sensitive analytical techniques facilitating the detection and quantification of nps could overcome this major hurdle for np mps related investigations 4 methods to alter model nano and micro plastics for specific purposes when sourcing model np mps to meet the investigation requirements it is sometimes necessary to implement subsequent modifications to facilitate np mps identification mimic the weathering np mps are exposed to when released in the environment or load np mps with relevant concentrations of contaminants this section reviews current techniques that can be used to modify the bulk and surface physico chemical properties of np mps and discusses the impact of such modifications on np mps buoyancy and agglomeration behaviour 4 1 tagging techniques to facilitate nano and micro plastics analysis np mps detection and quantification is usually performed by visual identification or spectroscopic analyses however these techniques lack accuracy and are often time consuming 232 tagging has recently risen as a quick and reliable alternative to identify np mps by using lipophilic dyes detectable with fluorescent or uv light 233 fluorescent np mps are widely used for toxicological assays where locating np mps in tissues or organs of living organisms fed with np mps is crucial to understand np mp toxicity 12 234 236 commercial fluorescent np mps are available as spheres which are not representative of irregularly shaped np mps found in the environment tagging procedures have therefore been developed to stain a wide range of np mps materials and shapes nile red nr is the most common dye used to stain np mps due to its high affinity for a broad range of polymeric materials such as pe pp pet ps and nylon rendering these materials fluorescent between 254 and 530 nm excitations 237 240 nr staining is conducted by submerging np mps in a diluted nr solution for 0 5 24 h usually followed by a filtration step to recover the stained np mps 238 239 the stained np mps are then examined on the collection filters under uv light at a specific wavelength and identified based on their emission spectrum care must however be taken when selecting the collection filter to minimize its interference with light when stained for instance nr stained nitrocellulose filters are fluorescent from 470 to 530 nm while glass fibres and pc filters are not from 254 to 625 nm 237 besides the excitation wavelength must be selected based on the composition of the sample to ensure all np mps are detected although most nr stained synthetic materials can be identified by exhibiting a strong fluorescence at 470 nm excitation wavelength stained organic matter also fluoresces at 470 nm therefore a digestion step is required to ensure that no organic matter is left in the sample 237 an alternative is to work under 254 nm excitation where stained organic matter does not fluorescent nevertheless several nr stained materials such as ps and nylon cannot be identified at 254 nm which limits the use of such procedure to pe pp and pet materials only 237 although nr appears as a versatile tool to facilitate np mps detection a commercial textile dye idye pink has been reported to provide similar if not superior staining performance to nr regarding fluorescence intensity and stability during exposure to living organisms 233 idye pink stained ps microparticles stayed fluorescent over 72 h upon ingestion by a salina shrimp with a fluorescence intensity up to two orders of magnitude higher than that obtained for nr stained np mps 233 several dyes may also render specific synthetic materials highly fluorescent such as acridine orange with pet or safranin t with cellulose acetate 237 although nr is the most versatile dye to tag np mps several other dyes are relevant to facilitate np mps identification in environmental samples provided that the right excitation light filter and exposure medium are combined to np mps of appropriate composition fig 4 alternatively radiolabeling may be used to detect 18f labeled np mps in toxicological studies via positron emission tomography or single photon emission computed tomography as commonly performed with polymers or inorganic particles for in vivo medical applications 241 242 although the short half life t1 2 of 18f of 110 min may limit the application of such labelling to np mps used in long term experiments longer lived radionuclides are also available such as 64cu t1 2 12 7 h 72as t1 2 26 h or 124i t1 2 4 2 d and may be more suitable for np mps detection the synthesis of radiolabeled compounds can be conducted via direct or indirect coupling involving labeled prosthetic groups or chelating agents which selection depends on the material to be labelled 241 radiolabeling may also be used to investigate the adsorption desorption of labelled persistent organic pollutants onto np mps such as phenanthrene and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane 163 243 4 2 modification techniques to mimic environmental nano and micro plastics np mps found in the environment differ from pristine plastic materials in term of surface and bulk physical properties as well as chemical composition since np mps released in the environment have been exposed to diverse conditions and interacted with a wide range of pollutants and microorganisms 244 although a strong database has been developed regarding np mps fate behaviour and toxicity using pristine np mps materials 245 246 more complex np mps models representing environmental np mps are required to understand the true impact these plastic particles considering their interactions with the surroundings 247 4 2 1 artificial loading of contaminants on model nano and micro plastics np mps are considered as potential carriers of hazardous chemicals due to the adsorption desorption phenomenon occurring between np mps and contaminants in the environment 248 although contaminated np mps can induce inflammatory responses when ingested by aquatic species 249 the sorption mechanism and resulting toxicity of such contaminated np mps remain unclear this section summarises lab scale protocols to artificially load contaminants on np mps subsequently used for sorption and toxicological studies while matching the same level of contamination than real np mps tables s14 and 15 4 2 1 1 loading of pollutants pollutants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane ddts may be released in the environment from land based activities and a large number of studies have reported their presence onto np mps 187 250 257 pahs and pcbs are amongst the most detected pollutants on np mps surface due to their hydrophobic properties which facilitates their diffusion through np mps 258 259 in deionised water only two days are required to sorb benzo a pyrene bap on 20 Î¼m large ldpe mps at an environmental concentration of bap of 15 Î¼g g 1 251 using smaller np mps can increase the uptake of pollutants by 30 due to their larger surface to volume ratio and available specific surface area 254 as an example 6 4 Î¼g g 1 of pcbs can sorb on 500 Î¼m large ps spheres while 8 5 Î¼g g 1 can sorb on 6 Î¼m large ps spheres for the same loading of np mps within two days 254 this aspect is environmentally relevant since up to 19 Î¼g g 1 of pcbs have been detected on np mps samples collected on a beach in japan 258 a prolonged exposure between the pollutant and np mps may bring the system closer to its sorption equilibrium corresponding to the maximum diffusion of the pollutant through np mps 260 a sorption equilibrium of 630 Î¼g g 1 of pcbs was measured on ps nanospheres 70 nm after six weeks of exposure 255 this sorption capacity is however over 30 times higher than that commonly reported on beached resin pellets 258 nonetheless determining the sorption equilibrium and kinetics is useful to subsequently tune the exposure time between np mps and pollutants and reach the desired sorption level pharmaceuticals such as antibiotics are an emerging class of pollutants which constitute a serious concern due to their prevalence in the environment 261 262 contrary to pahs pcbs and ddts which are hydrophobic chemicals antibiotics can develop polar interactions and hydrogen bonding with polymeric materials such as poly amide pa 16 hence within four days up to 2818 Î¼g g 1 of amoxicillin can sorb on pa particles smaller than 200 Î¼m in size 16 although the sorption of antibiotics by np mps is reduced in seawater 16 antibiotics present in freshwater could potentially sorb onto pa fibres released from laundry wash antibiotics have not been detected on np mps extracted from environmental samples to date however the toxicity of antibiotic loaded np mps has been reported 263 hence research in this area is most likely to rise in the near future 4 2 1 2 loading of additives additives such as phthalates polydibrominated diphenyl ethers pbdes phenols perfluorinated alkyl substances pfass and trace metals are commonly used in plastic materials as plasticisers flame retardant uv stabilisers and pigments respectively plastic additives are usually not chemically bonded to the polymer matrix but mixed with the polymeric matrix and may therefore migrate from the bulk polymer to their surrounding environment 264 265 plasticisers such as phthalate compounds commonly used in pvc materials have been detected on pp and pe np mp debris 266 267 and multiple combinations of additives np mps can be found in the environment such np mps can be produced at a lab scale to generate a consistent batch of additives loaded np mps at environmentally relevant concentrations table s15 phthalates pbdes and phenols can be adsorbed on np mps by mixing the additives solution with np mps and evaporating the solvent 268 this technique may however lead to a concentration of additives on np mps higher than the environmental reference 252 which can be avoided by reducing the concentration of the additives solution in contact with np mps 268 metal oxide pigments are widely used in the plastic industry and are therefore commonly detected on np mps 269 these pigments may also be released across the environment from agricultural automotive or marine industries and subsequently become adsorbed onto np mps thus increasing the concentration of metals present on their surface up to 15 mg g 1 270 artificial loading of np mps with metals can be performed with plasma emission standard solutions of metals such as cr cu and zn to achieve concentrations from 0 297 Î¼g g 1 within 48 h of exposure to pe fragments to 7 900 Î¼g g 1 after 14 days 15 271 metal loading has also been conducted using a plate coated with an antifouling paint containing cu and zn to simulate the transfer of metals leaking from the paint to np mps which resulted in cu and zn concentrations on np mps of up to 1 320 Î¼g g 1 within 14 days 13 although pfass substances are emerging contaminants which have not been detected on np mps to date pfass sorption capacity on np mps of up to 70 Î¼g g 1 have been reported 17 272 273 hence it is expected that research involving pfass loaded np mps will start to grow in the future 4 2 2 weathering of model microplastics a vast majority of np mps collected from real soil or water environment have been reported with a weathered surface resulting from external mechanical stress and oxidation 274 275 this section discusses current protocols used to generate artificially weathered np mps and their suitability for investigations focusing on the impact of weathered np mps on the environment tables s16 and s17 4 2 2 1 exposure to natural conditions the most straightforward method to produce a large number of weathered np mps is to expose np mps to natural conditions such as outdoor uv moisture and temperature while placed in soil water or air environment and retrieve them after a specific period of exposure 202 276 280 table s16 frame supports mesh bags or home made traps are commonly used to maintain plastic items such as ropes 276 carrier bags 202 278 microbeads 279 and fragments 277 in outdoor conditions the main chemical and physical consequences of weathering on plastic items are the oxidation of the material and the decrease of its mechanical properties 2 oxidation is usually monitored by assessing the oxygen to carbon ratio o c and the carbonyl index ci of exposed plastic items which may rise by more than ten times after exposure in air for 180 days 278 o c and ci are usually obtained via ftir or xps measurements of the aged np mps 278 281 tensile strength and brittleness are commonly used to investigate the physical impact of weathering which can induce the fragmentation of plastic materials into np mps smaller than 5 mm after 120 days of exposure 278 overall weathering is more severe under atmospheric conditions such as on soils or sand as opposed to marine and freshwater conditions where np mps are submerged in water 90 this phenomenon is most probably due to the lower temperature and decreased uv light intensity in aqueous systems which slows down some oxidation processes leading to less chemical and mechanical damage 278 furthermore biofilm formation is usually observed on plastic materials exposed over a long period to natural marine and freshwater conditions resulting in an unwanted surface contamination by marine organisms clay or sediments 202 277 279 this issue may be avoided by submerging plastic pellets under seawater or freshwater in glass trays and exposing them to natural solar radiation 282 283 4 2 2 2 exposure to simulated conditions accelerated ageing is commonly used to produce weathered np mps in a short amount of time equivalent to np mps exposed to outdoor conditions such as air water and soil for years 22 283 284 most protocols involve thermo oxidation 281 photo oxidation 285 and or chemical oxidation processes 283 and in some cases mechanical processes 22 to generate weathered np mps within timeframes as short as 3 h 285 table s17 heat treatments are well known to increase oxidation rates hence temperatures from 45 to 75 c are commonly used in combination with uv light to enhance the photo oxidation reaction taking place with np mps 284 286 after two months under natural air outdoor atmospheric conditions ldpe films carbonyl index ci reached 0 17 while only 72 h were required to reach the same ci upon exposure to uva at 60 c in a weathering chamber 287 ageing chambers are convenient to conduct simulated ageing tests since relative humidity temperature and uv irradiation are easily controlled this equipment is however costly and therefore not available across all facilities nevertheless accelerated weathering can also be performed using strong oxidation reactive such as fenton reagent ozone or hydrogen peroxide 283 285 288 fenton reagents are usually used to remove organic matter from np mps by exposing np mps for less than 10 min 289 exposure to fenton reagents for 30 days may also oxidise np mps and lead to an ageing degree after one month of exposure similar to that obtained for np mps exposed to natural conditions for 11 months 283 ozone treatments may also dramatically reduce np mps ageing time down to 3 h by generating ps np mps with a o c ratio of 0 62 285 while this ratio only reaches 0 2 after 11 months in outdoor conditions 283 although these strong oxidation treatments produce weathered np mps at a relevant degree of ageing some procedures can lead to the fragmentation of np mps which can be an issue when the aim is to obtain aged np mps within a specific size range ps and pe granules were found to break down after 30 days of exposure to a strong oxidising agent k2s2o8 at 70 c resulting in a decrease of the particle size from 50 to less than 20 Î¼m 283 similarly a long exposure time to uva uvb and uvc may lead to the embrittlement of plastic pellets which may not be suitable for further experiments 22 specifically the surface of artificially weathered pp pellets was found to erode during sorption tests rendering the pellets useless for the rest of the study 286 hence care must be taken when selecting the experimental conditions to generate artificially weathered np mps at the desired ageing degree and with suitable mechanical properties several accelerated weathering protocols involving a mechanical process such as a rolling bottle filled with sand may also be used to mimic the mechanical weathering occurring in the environment such as on the beach and generate on purpose np mps with a rough surface 22 np mp surface roughness is an important factor to consider when investigating biofilm formation 290 and np mp adsorption capacity 291 292 since an eroded rough surface can impact the interactions between np mps and their surroundings although physical etching can be performed to control the surface roughness of polymeric materials 293 294 no etching protocol has been developed for np mps yet although weathering under natural conditions is the most representative of the environment the need for long exposure time from months to years and the lack of reproducibility do not favour this weathering method against lab scale simulated ageing protocols which are quicker and allow better control of the process 4 3 consequences of surface modifications to mimic nano and micro plastics in the environment altering the surface and bulk properties of model np mp materials to mimic np mps extracted from the environment may impact the behaviour of np mps and therefore drastically alter expected behaviour compared to pristine materials np mp buoyancy can be affected by a change in np mp density due to the adsorption of inorganic and organic contaminants but also due to a change of crystallinity occurring upon weathering 276 295 a change of buoyancy can become an issue for investigations such as toxicity assays where organisms are fed with np mps in suspension in the culture medium sinking or floating np mps could decrease the availability of np mps to the organisms and lead to biased results another major issue potentially occurring upon np mps modification is the homo and hetero aggregation of np mps 9 119 296 297 the temperature ionic strength or presence of suspended matter may alter np mps electrical double layer thickness and surface charge leading to agglomeration in solution a high ionic strength such as found in seawater i 0 7 m can screen ps nps electrical double layer and therefore reduce the electrostatic repulsion occurring between nps and finally lead to their homo aggregation 297 as an example raising the solution temperature increases the likelihood of collision between nps which energy overcomes their potential energy barrier resulting in np agglomeration 297 finally the formation of complex hetero aggregates of ps nps with phytoplankton or exopolymeric substances was observed after being exposed to natural seawater which questions the use of natural water during weathering or sorption experiments 119 296 hence it is crucial to ensure that model np mps are stable in the target medium upon weathering or sorption procedures buoyancy issues can be tackled by optimising the density of the medium or by selecting an appropriate agitation device agglomeration issues can be avoided by carefully selecting the temperature ionic strength and composition of the medium more specifically when additional organic inorganic or biological species are present 5 challenges in the characterisation of nano micro plastics np mps come in a variety of compositions shapes sizes and surface contaminants affecting hydrodynamic stability in water uptake by cells and therefore toxicity 298 as well as specific interactions in their carrying medium 299 the history of the materials and their properties may lead to potential fragmentation or agglomeration thus requiring gentle but efficient extraction processes towards their analysis 300 301 the fracturing of composite materials and polymer at the filler polymer matrix interface is of particular concern and leads to faster ageing and fragmentation 302 the characterisation of np mps is also challenging due to the typically varied nature of the water matrices in which they were present or extracted from combined to their broad properties and morphological distributions 9 a sound base for scientists to benchmark techniques and make educated choices on appropriate characterisation techniques fit for purpose is therefore required 21 the aim of this section is to provide comparative information on the key precautions to be taken upon np mp extraction as well as to the main particle characterisation techniques currently available to assess the occurrence nature and size distribution of np mp materials in addition normalised approaches when dealing with np mp materials must also be developed and followed consistently to allow for assessment of studies reproducibility 5 1 extraction protocols and their potential impact on characterisation techniques particle characterisation techniques will require a degree of sub sampling to perform a measurement and the definition of a minimum volume and number of samples to be statistically relevant such approaches lead irremediably to issues around unreliable and unreproducible measurements which are empirically related to sampling strategies 303 particle counting approaches performed in the food pharma detection or synthesis industries where medium volumes of a few tens or hundreds of millilitres maximum measure only a small fraction of the overall materials within a production line 304 307 at the laboratory scale the percentages of the volumes utilised and analysed may be greater but given time and quality control constraints it is often unrealistic to test more than few millilitres for each repeat sample 308 it is therefore essential that the subsample measured by the instrument is as representative as possible of the entire process within product specifications challenges related to statistical relevance of such sampling across very large volumes will not be addressed in this section but must be kept in mind when engaging on the occurrence of statistical distribution analysis 309 in the following liquid suspension characterisations where samples are extracted directly from liquids or from solid waste will be primarily referred to as lixiviate corresponding to a solution generated by selective digestion of specific influent materials and offering higher purity than the source materials aspects such as the colloidal suspension stability including agglomeration of particles or sedimentation due to differences in relative densities as well as heterogeneous solute to particle interactions and chemical stability over time including solvent uptake or surface modifications will greatly affect the kinetics of the analysis such parameters will confer to specific techniques relevant ability to provide a clear picture of the colloidal system and its transient and steady state regimes 310 311 the characterisation of np mps regardless if in situ synthesised or extracted from soil or waters will therefore face the same challenges the agglomeration of nps has been extensively modelled and described and readers shall refer to reference manuscripts on unified agglomeration models as well as key mechanisms for self assembly in solution 299 312 the aspect ratio of nano sized particles from 0 d spheres 1 d nanofibres or nanotubes to 2 d sheet like materials will greatly affect the kinetics of agglomeration due to the enhanced contribution of surface interactions and specific surface area the understanding of such interactions for nano sized materials can be correlated thanks to the close density and buoyancy values to previous works on carbon nanomaterials such as fullerenes nanotubes or graphene 313 such methods were applied to the development of suspensions of polymeric nanofibres 314 317 particularly the interactions of nano sized carbon materials with np mp materials may support their extraction or characterisation in the case of liquid samples from marine environments aquifers or rivers numerous pre treatments must be carried out to ensure that the np mps are properly extracted from fresh sludge and marine effluents as well as to facilitate the analysis of samples expertise rising from years of work on nano macro latex particles used in biological applications as tags or drug delivery systems has paved the way for the development of isolation treatment strategies a very large number of strategies have been proposed and found to be efficient to isolate np mps for these effluents primarily relying on direct digestion of organics selective dissolution of surface inorganic adsorbents and densimetry sieving strategies 85 318 320 the transposition of a technique from one type of effluent to another comes with a range of challenges to match the relevant ranges of appropriate technique operation such strategies include direct liquid extraction density flotation techniques high pressure sieving and compaction as well as magnetic extraction to induce semi selective phase separation of the particles efficient strategies rely on the native properties of np mps and relatively strong resistance to acids bases as well as general sturdy mechanical properties often making them resilient enough to sustain strong without noticeable damages 321 322 risks associated to fragmentation or fracturing of the materials however exist and should be considered when implementing stressful extraction or purification mechanisms which is rendered more difficult by the broad size distribution and low buoyancy of np mps 323 systematic studies evaluating the impact of such treatment on model particle size distributions as well as yielding faster and more selective extraction protocols are however lacking and must be designed and trialled much less has been reported on soils pastes and solid source materials for np mps extraction grinding or dissociation of the source material matrix may be required to extract np mps and generate a lixiviate 324 similar to some liquid extraction technologies digestion of organic matter to recover otherwise undigested np mps was carried out as a pre treatment step with various chemicals including h2o2 fenton reagents and alkaline bases 84 allowing for a lean lixiviate formation as well as enzymatic reactions sludge compost materials were also evaluated and pre treated by soil fractionation through dry wet sequential separation and sieving 325 such separation processes are tedious but efficient and require large volume and repeat of samples to be statistically significant 326 physical grinding mechanisms may also lead to surface or bulk particulate damage thus affecting the surface chemistry through oxidation reactions but also and more prominently the particle size distribution this aspect was evidenced recently for np mps extracted from commercial cosmetic face scrub paste like materials which were found to fragment under mild stress the fragmentation was attributed to the history of the material and pre stressed or cracked area within the material 9 if a stable suspension or lixiviate is required for the characterisation test the effects of any sampling challenges due to unstable colloidal mixtures for instance may be minimised by homogenising and the material prior to testing the development of time stable suspensions which effluent stability depends on the proper operational properties of the technique needs to be controlled for each characterisation technique such kinetics may be ranging from seconds to minutes and will ultimately dictate the characterisation technique suitability and usability extraction of np mps was also achieved through relatively slow densitometry techniques by utilising gradients of highly saline suspensions of bromide salts after washing 327 which although tedious represents an accurate extraction protocol from colloidal to solid fractions for various polymeric materials the design of mixing demixing systems to render operation simpler and faster would be required to make this technique applicable for large sampling volumes of a few tens of litres or more a route to tackle such issues may therefore be to couple centrifugation to densimetry to collect kinetics data at various states of colloidal stabilisation although not applied to np mp separation to date sequential or inertial micro fluidic devices previously used for particulate matter separation could be one of such options but would nevertheless require pre treatments such as digestion to extract the np mp phase from the raw influent 328 329 5 2 size fractionation of polydisperse nano and micro plastics alternative techniques based on physical separation have been developed for measuring the size of nanoparticles one could mention differential centrifugal sedimentation dcs field flow fractionation fff or chromatography as widely used techniques falling into this category 21 330 both fff and hydrodynamic chromatography hdc have been used in np mp studies whereas to the best of our knowledge dcs has never been applied to np mp solutions dcs has been primarily used for the analysis of the interaction between biological material and nanoparticles 331 332 or the separation of cells components 333 5 2 1 differential centrifugal sedimentation dcs dcs separates particles according to their size density and shapes with the help of a spinning disc that exerts a centrifugal force towards the particles in this technique the particles are injected at the centre of the disc which rotation induces the migration of particles to the edges of the disc 330 since particles with different sizes shapes or densities do not move at the same pace stratification will appear with smaller and lighter particles close to the centre whereas larger and heavier ones will be found in the outer regions of the disc the distance of the particles from the centre can be correlated to the hydrodynamic diameter of particles through the stokes law 330 usually this method is applied for sizes ranging from 0 01 Î¼m to 50 Î¼m 334 even though the range may depend on the particle material 5 2 2 field flow fractionation fff fff stratifies liquid matrices flowing within a thin 50 300 Î¼m channel 229 under laminar flow by exerting a force perpendicular to the direction of flow 335 the force triggers the migration of particles towards a portion of the channel known as accumulation wall where an equilibrium between the force applied and back diffusion takes place and results in the stratification of the sample perpendicularly to the flow 336 since the flow velocity pattern of the laminar fluid has a parabolic curvature along the channel particles exhibiting different diffusivity behaviours relative to the applied force will be eluted at different times 229 many variants have been developed based on the nature of the force that can be thermal gradient electrical magnetic gravitational centrifugal and so forth 21 336 the most common configuration is asymmetric flow field flow fractionation af4 that uses a perpendicular flow passing through a semi permeable membrane af4 can separate a mixture of small particles 1 50 nm as well as large colloids 2 100 Î¼m 335 that can be composed of complex macromolecules such as proteins fulvic and humic substances or simpler entities e g poly styrene and latex beads 229 337 post separation detection techniques such as dls uv vis absorption fluorescence or pyr gc ms are commonly used for the characterisation of the separated entities 231 the applicability of af4 for nps and mps studies have been investigated in a handful of studies that mainly relied on mals 338 339 with additional analyses done by fluorescence 140 uv vis 339 or pyr gc ms 339 it has been demonstrated that spiked fluorescent ps and pe nps could be successfully retrieved and analysed in complex matrices such as fish tissues after enzymatic digestion followed by af4 140 nonetheless the authors also pointed out that the procedure had to be adapted to the type of nps to be separated efficiently a nahco3 solution would be more suitable for ps whereas an alkaline detergent fl 70 yielded better separation for pe 140 af4 may also produce measurement artefacts because of interactions between the particles and the semi permeable membrane the size cut off of the membrane will also determine the particles that can be obtained at the end of the channel 21 additionally an effect known as steric inversion occurs for particles of 1 Î¼m or above with a strong dependence on the channel thickness flow rate and cross flow the steric inversion leads to the co elution of large and small particles which may hamper the post separation characterisation steps 231 5 2 3 chromatography chromatography separates mixtures in liquid or gas solutions through differential partitioning between the mobile and stationary phases common techniques applied to the characterization of engineered nanoparticles include high performance liquid chromatography hplc gas chromatography gc size exclusion chromatography sec and hdc 231 all are defined for a different type of samples with sizes range of 5 nm 1 2 Î¼m 1 nm 100 nm and 1 nm 40 nm for hdc sec and hplc respectively 231 however hplc and gc do not separate particles according to their sizes but according to their chemical properties which can also be applied in the determination of contaminants adsorbed on mps 5 2 3 1 size exclusion chromatography sec sec is constituted of a column packed with inert and highly porous material with well controlled pore diameters small molecules and particles may have a longer residence time in the column since they can travel between the grains as well as inside the micro fractures in this configuration interactions between the static medium and particles are to be avoided to obtain discrimination only based on the size and shape of particles sec has been proposed to analyse pe beads in cleansing products with the possibility to obtain both the size distribution and np mp content per product after calibrating the ir detector the methodology was able to obtain robust size distributions with good resolution for bimodal samples with distribution gaps of about 55 000 g mol 1 167 however the resolution is often restricted to 10 species or less 340 recently sec has been applied for the study of polymer dissolved organic matter stressing that additive free polymers generated predominantly low molecular weight neutral species 350 da irrespective of the initial polymer chemistry pe vs pp and exposition to uv irradiation 341 however np mps are prone to fragmentation due to shear stress and collision against the porous stationary medium which may bias the size distribution determination and participate in co elution of particles 21 the applicability to environmental matrices is difficult since the shape greatly influences the retention of np mps in the column even when the molecular weight or volume are similar 340 correlation between the stokes radii and the retention in sec have been elaborated for natural compounds such as proteins and dna 340 similar calibration would be required for aspect ratios of well defined np mps before any consistent application in environmental studies 5 2 3 2 hydrodynamic chromatography hdc unlike sec hdc separates particles according to their size with completely non porous beads packed in the column the separation of particles is dictated by the hydrodynamic conditions generated within the interstices of the stationary phase where the mobile phase flows 231 342 space between the packing beads creates a velocity gradient with larger particles traversing the capillary in the centre of the flow where the velocity is maximum and smaller particles tend to displace on the edges leading to longer elution time for small particles 21 342 the ability of hdc to resolve polydisperse samples has been described for ps and pmma beads with sizes ranging from 2 21 107 to 1 39 1010 g mol 1 343 in this study hdc was not able to fully resolve quadrimodal samples but the use of multi angle light scattering mals quasi elastic light scattering qels and differential refractometry dri subsequent analysis provided sufficient information to overpass the detection limitations of hdc little has been done to evaluate the applicability of the technique to np mps however the use of plastic particles as models for calibrating or assessing the efficiency of the technique 343 344 may permit extrapolation of the results it has been demonstrated that the shape of particles had a major impact on the separation efficiency whereas the surface charge and chemical composition did not affect the separation noticeably 344 5 3 morphology and size particles may undergo several self assembly or agglomeration processes with other similar or dissimilar particulate matter or macromolecules while also capturing through surface chemi or physi sorption random contaminants present in liquids these aspects will significantly affect the relative size and shape of particles and therefore a choice of techniques required for distributions determination 5 3 1 liquid state characterisation 5 3 1 1 dynamic light scattering dls dynamic light scattering dls is a well established technique for the size determination of nano and microscale particles or aggregates 330 345 the technology relies on the light scattering of a monochromatic laser beam 346 by suspended nanoparticles undergoing brownian motion 347 dls calculates the average size distribution of a sample by analysing the variation of the scattered light intensity on a detector 345 dls is user friendly does not require intensive sample preparation and can be applied for particles ranging from 4 nm to 100 Î¼m 21 345 however the technology cannot resolve polydisperse samples and may only deliver an approximated size distribution shifted towards larger particles since the intensity of the scattered light is a function of the sixth power of the size of the particle 346 348 dls has not been routinely applied to np mps studies because of the impossibility to discriminate plastic particles from natural organic or inorganic content by light scattering and the lack of information on the shape of the np mps analysed 14 light scattering techniques calculate the hydrodynamic diameter of particles by considering them as ideal rigid spheres 346 even though particles within natural samples may likely not respect this hypothesis furthermore environmental samples may be composed of a wide size distribution of np mps which could not be accurately characterised by dls without proper preparation of the sample 330 347 dls may not be appropriate for direct size determination of np mps in complex matrices but the technology has the potential to be combined with other characterisation techniques for assaying the parameters of the system in simple methodologies for instance electrophoretic light scattering els and dls have been successfully combined to evaluate the aggregation state through the measurement of the zeta potential as well as the size distribution 5 3 1 2 nanoparticle tracking analysis nta nanoparticle tracking analysis nta is a characterisation technique that can determine the size distribution as well as the concentration of a sample based on particle to particle counting and analysis 347 349 likewise dls nta exploits brownian motion and light scattering for measuring the size distribution of a sample 330 350 the difference resides in the fact the nta tracks the short displacement of all particles individually thanks to a 20 x magnification microscope which results in the possibility to resolve polydisperse samples 347 351 352 nta can be operated for particles ranging from 10 to 1000 nm 21 347 and requires samples with a concentration of nanoparticles between 106 and 109 particles ml 21 349 this specific range of concentrations and the fact that the maximum permissible size is 1 Î¼m represent major drawbacks since this analytical procedures may be time consuming and requires extensive sample handling increasing the risks of contamination from airborne plastic particles 18 231 another disadvantage is the high degree of freedom the experimenter has during the analysis since visual selection during sampling may be performed to analyse and modify the settings of the software to obtain a better resolution 347 this aspect has been highlighted by a study where similar samples were analysed by five different research groups 353 in the absence of standardised guidelines on sample preparation and device operation high variability was obtained between the laboratories hence the development of robust protocols and the formation of the experimenter would be necessary to obtain valuable results to date nta has been applied to np characterisation by a handful of laboratory studies with well controlled experimental conditions 9 10 55 354 356 but has never found its place in field studies most of the sampling strategies applied in water media used towed manta trawl or plankton nets with mesh sizes always above 80 Î¼m leading to challenges if other contaminants non mps are also present in solution 138 smaller plastic particles have been rarely described in the literature because of practical considerations 231 indeed the sampling of nps which are all plastic particles below 1 Î¼m may pose a challenge since filtering real matrices induce fast clogging of tight pore filters and may require a labour intensive sampling campaign to obtain representative amounts of nps 138 as long as a robust sampling method for capturing nps in the environment does not exist nta could not be used to assess their relative abundance and particle size distribution 5 3 2 dry state characterisation 5 3 2 1 optical microscopy optical microscopy provides images of materials through the differences in contrast within the light reflected on the surface of the sample 21 this technique has been extensively used in np mp studies since this technology is fast cheap and simple 7 133 information on the size shape weathering state and breakage of plastic particles are obtained with the additional possibility to estimate the concentration by manual sorting and counting the spatial resolution is defined by the diffraction limit of the light used which mainly depends on the wavelength from 400 to 700 nm 357 and the aperture of the optical system 18 although the detection limit for light microscopy may range from 0 2 to 0 5 Î¼m 231 358 it would be largely inaccurate to use light microscopy for np mps below 10 Î¼m in environmental samples due to aggregation and interactions with colloidal matter 7 359 identification of np mps is complex in the presence of natural organic matter and inorganic particles and can induce misidentification and miscount 360 synthetic particles can be identified through visual criteria that are i no visible cellular or organic structures ii fibres should be equally thick along their entire length iii coloured particles must be homogeneous and clear with white and transparent particles requiring further analysis with higher magnification or fluorescence microscope 4 additional procedures such as hot needle test 361 362 or staining with a lipophilic fluorophore e g nile red 240 363 may decrease the risk of errors but are not completely reliable which still lead to bias a study evaluated that among 1279 suspected plastic particles extracted from the atlantic ocean and selected with optical microscopy 67 of suspected mps below 50 Î¼m were confirmed to be synthetic by raman spectroscopy whereas 83 of suspected plastic particles above 100 Î¼m were identified 359 optical microscopy and visual observation are necessary 364 but must be combined with suitable chemical characterisation techniques to obtain a representative and real overview of plastic pollution as mentioned before the possibility to classify particles according to their shape and size is the major asset of optical microscopy unfortunately it is a time consuming and mostly manual process to acquire reliable data since np mp shapes are mostly irregular key parameters need be measured to differentiate granules fibres from sheets spheres and fragments among primary parameters to be measured one could mention the area minimum and maximum diameter feret diameter and perimeter ideally other parameters used in microscopy such as the mean diameter the centre of gravity the radius of gyration or shape factors could be reported as well 18 furthermore the total number of particles counted should always be reported since it indicates the statistical pertinence of data 18 where optical microscopy fails to characterise the smaller fraction of np mps electron microscopy can be used since its spatial resolution is higher down to 0 02 nm for an energy of beam of 100 kev 357 5 3 2 2 electron microscopy em em techniques probe a material with a beam of electrons instead of photons under a strict vacuum a focused low energy electron beam is produced and directed toward the sample by electromagnetic lenses 357 conventional or environmental scanning electron microscopy sem is a high resolution 3d imaging technology based on the elastic scattering of the electrons whereas transmission electron microscopy tem provides 2d projection images by capturing the electrons that can pass through the sample on one hand sem does not require intensive sample preparation and is easy to use since it only scans the surface of the material on the other hand transmission electron microscopy tem requires ultra thin samples for the electrons to be transmitted 365 which inevitably complicates the procedure 330 both techniques are designed for the size determination of particles and can reveal additional information on the chemical properties of the material sem has been widely applied to np mp studies for determining the key features of particles such as their size aspect ratio or weathering state 18 although tem has known less popularity for the characterisation of plastic particles in the environment this technique can also provide valuable information on the presence of crystalline surface contaminants and on the level of amorphicity of the materials in em samples should be analysed with care because biological material or polymer based samples could melt shrink or charge under the electron beam 330 357 furthermore materials with poor electrical conductivity are not suitable for em unless additional coating with metals such as gold or platinum is performed 366 367 5 3 2 3 atomic force microscopy afm afm scans the surface of a sample with the help of a cantilever carrying a sharp tip moving across the surface the interactions between the tip and the sample change the relative position of the cantilever which can indicate the presence of grooves pits and peaks on the surface a laser reflected on the cantilever permits precise measurements of the deflection magnitude of the cantilever 21 afm can be operated in a vacuum air or liquid 231 and does not require intensive sample preparation 21 the mapping of surfaces puts afm in a strategic position for the physical characterisation of nanoparticles one of the major advantages of afm is the possibility to combine afm with chemical characterisation techniques like fourier transform infrared and raman spectroscopy 7 21 the technique is promising for nps analyses 7 but still suffers from major drawbacks that have not yet been alleviated unlike scattering technologies afm scans at slow rates 1 Î¼m s and cannot inform about the concentration within the liquid sample 21 furthermore afm relies on the interactions between a tip and the material which means that depending on the properties of the tip artefacts could be generated when analysing particles with different physico chemical structures 368 5 4 bulk chemistry and composition 5 4 1 vibrational spectroscopy vibrational spectroscopy represents one of the pillars of the chemical characterisation of any molecule and material all molecules may experience vibrations under visible infrared irradiation due to the elastic nature of chemical bonds resulting in characteristic spectra when irradiated over a specific wavelength range 369 most of the research on np mps have applied vibrational spectroscopy for determining the chemical composition of the sampled np mps through either fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir or raman spectroscopy fundamentally both techniques are complementary since ftir analyses vibrational modes that induce a change of dipole moment while raman detects those triggering a modification of the polarizability consequently the material to be analysed may be composed of vibrational modes that produce signals in ftir whereas no signal may appear in raman and vice versa 370 this consideration was investigated in a study aiming at answering if both techniques should be used to analyse sampled np mps or if they were equivalent 371 the authors remarked that pvc np mps were more detectable under raman spectroscopy whereas polyesters had a stronger signal with ftir furthermore ftir missed all particles ranging from 5 to 10 Î¼m and 40 of particles between 11 and 20 Î¼m whereas raman successfully identified these particles they concluded that both techniques can be used independently for np mps larger than 20 Î¼m but better accuracy would be obtained with both measurements 371 5 4 1 1 fourier transformed infrared ftir ftir may be operated in four variants namely transmission ftir diffuse reflectance ftir true specular reflectance ftir and attenuated total reflection ftir 21 to date the attention of researchers in the field of np mps has focused on transmission ftir and attenuated total reflectance ftir atr ftir in atr mode ir light enters the atr crystal in contact with the sample and is totally reflected at the crystal sample interface towards the detector 21 the signal sources from the penetration depth of the electromagnetic wave before reflection which varies proportionally to the ir wavelength applied 372 this is by far the most common ftir mode used in np mps studies for the chemical analysis of visually pre sorted suspected np mps 372 atr ftir is cost efficient requires little sample preparation and is non destructive even though the surface of the material may be indented upon tip compression onto the material 373 this mode is adequate to large np mps 500 Î¼m 231 but may lead to biased results if smaller particles or matter adhere strongly to the tip of the apparatus during operation leading to unwanted noise levels 373 transmission mode analyses the ir beam that passes through the sample which per definition requires thin samples that do not completely absorb ir light 21 furthermore since np mps collected in the environment undergo a succession of treatments that generally end up by a filtration step the transmission ftir analysis is generally performed with the particles directly on the filter in that case the filter is to be selected to avoid interactions with ir light which would lead to additional peaks in the spectrum related to the substratum 374 different ir transparent substrates have been proposed such as znse window 45 aluminium oxide filters 370 or silicon filter 375 silicon filters with a pore size of 10 Î¼m were proposed due to their transparency for a broad mid ir region 4000 to 600 cm 1 which was suitable for the distinction of chemically close polyesters such as poly ethylene terephthalate and poly butylene terephthalate 375 whereas aluminium oxide filters tested were limited to the range 3600 to 1500 cm 1 370 another aspect to consider in all ftir modes is the presence of impurities from organic and inorganic origin that can interact with the ir beam and produce a signal moisture is an important interference during the analysis which must be removed prior to analysis through drying steps 372 np mps in the environment are prone to chemical modification through weathering leading to the formation of chemical bonds that can be observed in the ftir spectra such as hydroxyl 3100 3700 cm 1 carbonyl 1690 1810 cm 1 and alkenes 1600 1680 cm 1 373 modification of the initial crystallinity may also lead to the formation disappearance of peaks 376 this difference may become an asset during ftir analysis to estimate the degree of ageing and weathering of a particle according to the intensity of characteristics peaks therefore carbonyl index hydroxyl index and carbon oxygen index have been proposed to assess np mp weathering 231 373 5 4 1 2 raman raman spectroscopy uses low wavelength dispersion lasers down to 500 nm which allows for a better spatial resolution as compared to ftir that is restricted to the infrared spectrum 1 Î¼m vs 10 Î¼m 18 231 raman spectroscopy may not be as influenced by water presence as ftir is 377 but is prone to interferences from sample fluorescence 375 organic materials and biological polymers are well known sources of fluorescence if excited at specific wavelength 375 which may overshadow the main raman signal 377 the removal of such contaminants through digestive degradation is therefore a critical pre treatment step an automated algorithm to suppress the fluorescence background generated by biofilms developed onto np mp particles was generated which remarkably resulted in clearer pe spectra 378 fluorescence may occur from dyes and additives encapsulated within the polymer material 377 as well as from the substratum where the analysis is performed 379 in the objective of determining the filter that would allow to obtain the better resolution with no background interference 11 membranes including modified poly carbonate silver aluminium oxide have been compared for the characterisation of np mps aluminium coated poly carbonate was found to yield lower noise and fluorescence production levels under laser excitation 379 5 4 1 3 combined techniques the most promising application of vibrational spectroscopy is the possibility to combine it with key techniques applied in np mps studies such as optical microscopy the hyphenated characterisation tool associated to optical microscopy and ftir or raman is defined as Î¼ftir or Î¼raman respectively to date Î¼ftir has been studied more than Î¼raman with continuous improvement towards automation for counting and chemical characterisation of particles 380 381 atr Î¼ftir has been tested but suffered from long scanning time on the order of seconds per point limiting throughput for large sampling or mapping areas 382 where the size of each pixel will vary from a few micron to a few tens or hundreds of microns depending on the crystal size and the light source consequently transmission mode appears to be the most promising technique especially with the introduction of multiple focal plane array fpa detectors 383 that allows the fast scanning of the entire surface of the filter instead of selecting an area as performed in early studies 384 fpa Î¼ftir successfully scanned a filter of about 10 mm in diameter in less than 11 h with the possibility to identify np mps down to 20 Î¼m 383 the challenge of Î¼raman spectroscopy remains the time necessary for obtaining statistically relevant signals due to the low intensity of raman scattering long acquisition durations are necessary which may lead to potential heating and degradation of np mps efforts are made towards the reduction of acquisition time by improving the detector type ccd vs em ccd and targeting the zones where the scans occur to avoid the point by point mapping that analyses the filter multiple times such progress has allowed the scanning time that was initially about 38 h mm 2 371 to be reduced to 20 s mm 2 380 however Î¼raman has been less utilised for the characterisation of np mps since long measurement durations and interferences with contaminant materials often occur 21 378 5 4 2 x ray spectroscopy 5 4 2 1 energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds eds is a feature available during electron microscopy analysis and represents a powerful tool for obtaining qualitative and quantitative information on the chemical composition of a sample during the excitation of the material with an highly energetic electron beam electrons from the core shells of the atoms are expelled with electrons from the outer shells that migrate to fill the formed electronic holes 357 when this event occurs x ray photoelectrons with energies corresponding to the electronic transition are emitted and captured by a semiconductor detector e g silicon crystal each chemical element can be segregated based on their x ray emissions that paved the way towards the analysis of environmental samples of unknown composition mps have been successfully identified via sem eds with chlorinated polymers such as pvc 385 or ptfe 386 particularly recognizable with the strong chlorine elemental signature additionally to the polymer structure eds was also used for assessing biofouling and inorganic scaling across np mps 387 np mps sampled in the north western pacific were found to yield nitrogen peaks under sem eds analysis even though nitrogen is not a component of common synthetic polymers the authors suggested to use the magnitude of this peak as a proxy for biofouling since nitrogen is a primary component of biofilms and cells 388 it is noteworthy however that the evaluation of low atomic number elements by eds is not quantitative and elements lighter than fluoride cannot be trustfully evaluated with this technique limiting its span the sample preparation represents the main limitation of sem eds since the procedure is time consuming and difficult to achieve 387 as mentioned for sem sample preparation plasma sputtering of carbon or conductive metals is mandatory for the success of the method the thickness of this layer is usually around 10 nm however a too thick coating will interfere with the other signals while a too thin one will trigger the accumulation of charge and subsequent degradation of the polymer 389 5 4 2 2 x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps during xps the sample is bombarded with x ray radiations e 1500 ev in order to detach core electrons from the material 369 the kinetic energy of the electrons is measured and correlated to the binding energies between entities present within the material the technology is close to eds but conditions are milder under xps e g energies hundreds to thousands time inferior thus it can deliver information on the sub surface chemistry of the material penetration depth 2 5 nm 390 xps may provide precious information about the surface of np mps and has already been used to investigate ageing and weathering processes 283 391 the potential of xps in ageing studies has been demonstrated with aged ps np mps where xps was able to generate deconvoluted 1 s orbitals of oxygen involved in different chemical groups such as ketone hydroperoxide and peroxycarboxylic acid 392 this technology may enlighten on the mechanisms of weathering through a deeper understanding of the chain reaction involved in the surface oxidation with key limiting steps associated with specific functional groups 5 4 3 sorption and surface adsorption an underlying effect of np mp pollution is the accumulation of pollutants onto the particles and within the polymeric network 393 the contaminants may either originate from the manufacturing of the initial plastic materials such as residual catalysts or additives 394 395 or from other anthropogenic sources leading to the pollution of the environment including pesticides or pharmaceutical compounds 396 from a chemical perspective one may differentiate metallic pollutants such as arsenic 397 chromium 398 and organic pollutants including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs 399 and polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs 400 different characterisation tools have been used in np mps studies for the specific detection of these two classes of pollutants in general the identification of sorbed chemicals is done after separating the compounds from the np mp surface 401 liquid solid extraction has been primarily applied with techniques such as soxhlet extraction 402 403 ultrasonic extraction 404 and solvent soaking 405 the separation efficiency is highly dependent on the nature of the species to separate as well as the properties of the np mps the description of the different options when dealing with extraction of sorbed chemicals goes beyond the scope of this section but has been described elsewhere 133 401 5 4 3 1 sorbed metallic compounds atomic spectrometry gathers an array of techniques able to detect trace metal species at concentrations down to 0 1 Î¼g l 1 the most common techniques applied in np mp studies for the detection of sorbed metals are inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms and flame atomic absorption spectrometry faas 13 406 inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy icp aes has also found its place in a handful of studies 398 407 409 icp triggers a so called hard ionization under an argon plasma where most molecules of the sample are reduced to the atomic state with free flowing electrons 410 two preliminary steps for liquid samples are introduced to produce fine aerosols d 10 Î¼m via successive passage in the nebulizer and spray chamber 411 before undergoing icp ionization the particles can be decomposed with aqua regia hno3 hcl 1 3 mol 394 398 in order to retrieve all metallic species sorbed by the polymer 395 icp ms quantitatively characterises the elements of the sample with the separation of ionised atoms based on their m z ratio whereas icp aes analyses the spectroscopic spectrum produced by the elements icp ms has gain in popularity and tend to replace other atomic spectrometry techniques due to its higher sensitivity 410 5 4 3 2 sorbed organic compounds to date hplc has been primarily used to either detect sorbed chemicals on mps such as phthalates 412 413 and phenanthrene 414 or to analyse mono and oligomers formed during the depolymerisation of mps such as pet and pc 34 415 the application of lc with short length np mps in environmental samples has been described with ps np mps with molecular weights below 3000 da that were successfully analysed via lc arpi hrms liquid chromatography atmospheric pressure photoionisation source high resolution mass spectrometry with a lower limit of detection of 30 pg l 1 416 gc has been applied to np mp studies as a part of a hyphenated characterisation set including thermal degradation analysis e g pyrolysis tga and dsc and mass spectrometry ms 26 volatile molecules produced by thermal degradation can be efficiently separated by gc and analysed via ms 6 conclusions challenges and prospects the following section will present critical aspects related to the extraction characterization towards potential remediation of np mps the authors emphasized the core challenges and routes going forward to enable is more systematic analysis and collection extraction ii novel approaches to evaluate concentrations and size distributions or surface contaminants levels across np mps as well as iii novel routes to synthesize model materials to be used for laboratory and pilot scale studies this section is first and foremost a piece of opinion aiming at highlighting good practices and strategies which should be implemented to resolve the emerging and worrying issues arising from np mp pollution 6 1 np mp occurrence and collection the alarming rate in the rise of plastic contamination in the form of particles and fibres is currently occurring across all environmental compartments this trend is not only a result of direct pollution but also of the degradation and fragmentation of plastic items stressed through photo chemical mechanical and biological processes these weathering and historical events will affect the properties of collected np mps and also their surface compositions leading to significant up takes in organic or inorganic matters which may affect their further uptake by biological or chemical remediation systems reported concentrations are therefore underestimating true concentrations both in number and weight due to the inappropriateness of current sampling and quantification methods the large variability in the quality and quantity of the data in the literature is nevertheless directly linked to the lack of normalization of sampling and characterization techniques used and available to date although synthetic textile fibres and fragments of np mps are the dominant source of plastic in the environment these concentrations will only increase over the decades to come due to the lack of recycling and repurposing strategies for waste materials a truly circular economy approach is required immediately to ensure the valorisation and repurposing of such materials as well as their recovery from contaminated environments a major challenge lies with the currently unexplored area of nanoscale plastic materials which are systematically un explored in literature with only a handful of studies focusing on this crucial challenge specific guidelines must be developed for extraction sourcing or synthesizing np mps in the laboratory and thereafter characterizing resulting distributions there is therefore clear need to develop a detailed catalogue of standardised procedures combined with specific standards and analytical protocols to source and characterise model mps of various sizes and shapes although the sourcing from commercial products is appealing since rapid and cost effective recent and well justified bans on the use of microbeads and shopping bags have reduced the availability of plastic based products in most regions 417 419 6 2 diversity in sizes and shapes the extremely large range of materials shapes sizes and surface compositions or contaminations reported to date make any pertinent laboratory scale experiment on the capture or remediation of np mp difficult weathering and surface chemical loading of np mps occurring naturally in ecosystems will alter the np mps properties and lab induced selective weathering is an extremely promising approach to generate sample sets relevant to that found during occurrence studies np mps loading can be performed under natural conditions by exposing np mps to the environment however such conditions are hardly reproducible and can take up to several months to achieve the same contamination level as np mps artificially loaded under lab conditions new benchmarked synthesis methods for the generation of model np mps at the laboratory scale are also required to better predict the impact of such np mps on realistic systems and to model their interactions with complex water matrixes and biological systems various methods for generating model synthetic micro plastic fragments fibres and sheets to be used for mimicking the size shape and composition of common np mps found in the environment have been discussed routes ranging from the selective extraction of microplastics from commercial samples to top down and bottom up approaches were discussed and require further works and international benchmarking these synthesis processes may induce chemicals and mechanical stresses to the np mps which may further alter the physical and chemical properties of np mps and their subsequent modifications 6 3 surface properties alteration and ageing in addition the chemical and physical changes caused to the plastics once they are released in the environment further challenges our ability to accurately extract and characterise np mps appropriate and pertinent detection systems and strategies although available for mps in the range of the tens to hundreds of micrometers in size are available are desperately lacking for smaller particle fractions there is currently no standardised method of sampling and analysis of plastics in the environment and multi scalar interpretation of data sets presented in the literature is therefore biased and must be rendered in the context of the methods used in each study making cross studies comparisons hardly relevant this challenge is further compounded by the presence of submicron and nanosized fragments within single environmentally sourced samples which are difficult to extract and simultaneously detect quantify a series of novel techniques and strategies are therefore necessary to fully characterise the materials and develop a fingerprint of the np mps present in the samples last routes to load np mps with environmentally relevant contaminants may be achieved if the np mps are synthesized in situ through bulk loading or surface encapsulation loading environmentally relevant amounts of trace metals or metal oxide materials on np mps can also be achieved through specific reduction or precipitation it is recommended to combine metals such as cr cu and pb to np mps materials such as pe pp and pvc for which these metals have more affinity 6 4 extraction identification and characterization the challenges faced by extraction and detection of np mps in the environment solid liquid or airborne matrices as well as in the laboratory are i the low concentrations ii the broad size and shape distributions iii the buoyancy and densities of np mps which are close to water iv the increase surface effects over bulk properties at the short micro and nano scales and v the interactions with adsorbed contaminants and others particulate or colloidal matters which becomes extremely important at high surface to volume ratios the development of tagging technologies to trace np mps across complex environments have also been discussed but requires further investigation to generate more specific and yet stable tagging strategies the development of new characterization routes must be developed for both size and chemical composition evaluations given the outputs of current technologies one should envision systems where pre conditioning is performed through separative microfluidics devices while detection and counting are achieved through ir raman coupled to improved nta or sas operating units np mp fragments fibres and sheets are usually not detectable by common analytical techniques which have been standardised for spherical particles hence one must ensure that specific procedures and algorithms are developed to analyse np mps of various shapes for instance although turbidity and optical measurements can be performed to assess the concentration of fibres in a sample they cannot be used to characterize directly size distributions solutions allowing for operation in raw samples or with less needs for pre treatments would greatly support such endeavours small angle scattering sas with x ray or neutrons could offer such a solution to reveal the properties of dispersions in complex solution matrices at the right camera length as previously trialled for nanoscale and sub micrometre materials 420 421 further research and technologies development must be funded at the interface of research groups and equipment providers to allow for the development of more efficient and versatile characterization tools it is equally important that these tools are democratized and designed to be portable or scalable to ensure that areas of needs are not left behind in their assessment of occurrence and analysis 6 5 prospects the purpose of the authors when developing this review was to present a fair and objective account of the field it is hoped that this will generate new discussions in the area of standardisation characterisation and remediation strategies the challenges brought to researchers and scientists by np mps are nearly un precedented and a one fit them all solution will not be found it is the belief of the authors that multi disciplinary strategies only with efforts at the government academic and industry levels are required to tackle these issues this strategy must start with better stewardship strategies to ensure that plastics are not disposed of improperly anymore and that circular materials strategies are developed to make better value of these

13441,the roles of influent cellulose in regulating bio system performance and microbial community structure remain largely unknown here we investigated the wastewater treatment performance microbial diversity along with interspecific interaction in a membrane bioreactor mbr in the presence and absence of influent cellulose the results showed that the presence of cellulose did not affect reactor performance significantly including the removal of total nitrogen and organics p 0 05 for both however the absence of influent cellulose decreased the biodiversity of bacterial and fungal community as compared with the presence of cellulose thus the community structure between the two scenarios was significantly different proteobacteria 39 2 51 0 chloroflexi 25 2 18 7 and bacteroidetes 16 0 15 9 were the top 3 dominant phyla and cellulose degrading populations most of which were affiliated with bacteroidetes e g flavobacterium acetobacteroides and firmicutes e g exiguobacterium showed higher relative abundance when being fed with cellulose phylogenetic molecular ecological networks pmens indicated that biotic interactions were weaker in the presence of cellulose and possessed higher proportion of competitive relationships the keystone microbes including nitrogen and cellulose metabolism associated taxa were inconsistent between the two scenarios cellulose decomposer bryobacter and om190 nitrifier nitrospira and denitrifier sulfuritalea were the keystone microbes in the presence of cellulose while the species belonging to chloroflexi anaerolineaceae kouleothrix played important roles in the absence of cellulose this study highlights the important roles of cellulose in shaping microbial community structure and advances our understanding of characteristics of microbial ecology regulated by cellulose in mbr systems keywords cellulose microbial community membrane bioreactor ecological network wastewater treatment 1 introduction cellulose in wastewater treatment plants wwtps mainly originating from the use of toilet paper is a kind of slowly biodegradable organics in 2019 roughly 29 kilotons of toilet paper were used in china every day about 5 88 9 80 kg per person per year 1 and almost all toilet paper ended up being flushed into sewers it was estimated that the toilet paper cellulose fiber was responsible for 30 50 the suspended solids in the sewage 2 it has been observed that 33 84 of toilet paper fibers could enter bio treatment systems of wwtps with primary clarifiers and 55 97 for those without primary clarifiers 2 overall cellulose account for approximately 20 40 of total chemical oxygen demand cod of sewage influent 2 3 given that cellulose is an important fraction of municipal influent understanding the role of influent cellulose in wastewater treatment systems is vital to the operation and optimization of wwtps recent studies have improved our understanding of the effects of cellulose on biodiversity and community structure in natural and engineered ecosystems 4 for instance the roles of cellulose in aquatic soil anaerobic membrane bioreactor and sequencing batch reactor system have been previously studied 2 5 7 and microbial community subjected to different contents of cellulose showed distinct characteristics moreover it has illustrated that cellulose in swage increased the relative abundance of cellulolytic hydrolytic bacteria and change of influent cellulose ratio can shift the structure of cellulolytic species 2 3 8 9 in addition fungal species were observed to play important roles in cellulose degradation in both soil and aquatic systems 9 however there lacks of comprehensive knowledge about the response of bacterial and fungal community to influent cellulose in sewage treatment systems especially in anoxic aerobic membrane bioreactors a o mbrs system which are widely used for sewage treatment moreover the knowledge gaps regarding the roles of influent cellulose in regulating core functional groups ecological network and keystone taxa of activated sludge microbiota remain statistical analyses such as linear discriminant analysis lda can be applied to identify taxa with significantly different levels of abundance and lda effect size lefse analysis can elucidate the potential microbial biomarker expounding differentiate between different groups 10 besides ecological network analysis can characterize the interplay between co occurring species in microbial communities 11 12 enabling identification of the keystone populations crucial for maintaining microbiota structure 12 affirmably the usage of above methods could largely illuminate the role of influent cellulose in shaping microbial community structure and species interactions in sewage treatment ecosystems these knowledge are crucial to better manipulate and optimize the functioning of the biological processes for the cellulose containing wastewater treatment this work aimed to unravel the mechanisms of microbial community shift including biodiversity microbial structure core functional taxa and interspecies interaction driven by cellulose a lab scale a o mbr fed with and without cellulose was operated for a long period and the rector performance i e nutrient and organic removal was monitored regularly the 16s rrna gene and its gene sequencing were conducted to determine the diversity and structure of bacterial and fungal community respectively the lefse analysis was used to unravel the biomarker in different communities i e sludge microbiotas fed with and without cellulose moreover phylogenetic molecular ecological network pmen analyses were performed to decipher the interaction patterns ecological roles of co occurring taxa and thus identify the keystone taxa in microbial communities overall this work is proposed to improve our understanding of microbial ecology in cellulose containing wastewater treatment systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 mbr setup and operation an a o mbr with an effective total volume of 2 3 l 1 3 l for anoxic tank and 1 l for aerobic tank fig s1 in the supplementary information the solids retention time srt and hydraulic retention time hrt were set as 20 d and 12 h respectively a hollow fiber membrane module 0 046 m2 pvdf was submerged in the aerobic tank where aeration rate was set at ca 60 l h to maintain a dissolved oxygen do concentration of 2 0 3 0 mg l the seeding sludge was collected from a full scale wwtp in guangzhou china before the startup of this mbr the seeding sludge was acclimated to a synthetic wastewater table s1 for 30 days sludge recirculation from the aerobic tank to the anoxic tank was set at 200 of the influent flow average concentrations of total chemical oxygen demand tcod total nitrogen tn in the synthetic wastewater with were ca 250 mg l and 30 mg l respectively table s1 in phase i day 0 143 toilet paper cellulose 40 of tcod was added named as wtpc while in phase ii day 144 198 none of extra cellulose was added named as wotpc table s1 2 2 sample collection physical and chemical analyses influents supernatants and membrane effluents were collected regularly for the measurement of water parameters as well as protein and polysaccharide concentrations ammonia nitrogen mlss mlvss cod nitrate nitrogen no3 n nitrite nitrogen no2 n and total nitrogen tn were measured according to standard methods 13 the extraction of soluble microbial products smps and bound extracellular polymeric substances eps followed the modified procedure proposed by a previous study 14 polysaccharide ps and protein pn in eps and smp were determined by phenol sulfuric acid methods 15 and lowry method 16 respectively 2 3 dna extraction pcr amplification and data processing the sampling points of sludge are shown in fig s2 there were 16 samples from wtpc and 13 samples from wotpc resulting in a total of 29 biomass samples for dna extraction and subsequent analysis of microbial communities the e z n a soil dna kit omega bio tek norcross ga usa was used to extract microbial dna according to manufacturer s instructions the final dna concentration and purity were evaluated using a nanodrop 2000 uv vis spectrophotometer thermo scientific wilmington usa and dna quality was assessed by 1 agarose gel electrophoresis the v3 v4 hypervariable regions of the bacterial 16s rrna gene were amplified with 338 f and 806r primers using a thermocycler pcr system geneamp 9700 abi usa while the its2 region of fungi its gene was amplified with its3f and its4r primers pcr reactions were conducted following previous studies 17 18 the resulting pcr products were then extracted by using 2 agarose gel afterwards the pcr products were further purified by the axyprep dna gel extraction kit axygen biosciences union city ca usa and quantified by quantifluor st promega usa following the manufacturer s protocols then amplicons were sequenced on an illumina miseq pe300 platform at the shanghai majorbio bio pharm technology co ltd processing of sequencing data was performed according to previous works 17 18 the raw reads were then deposited into the ncbi sequence read archive database under accession prjna529301 2 4 bioinformatics and statistics analyses the paired end reads were assembled using flash v1 2 11 https ccb jhu edu software flash index shtml the qiime version 1 9 1 was used to filter the paired end reads for quality control to obtain effective tags and align the operational taxonomic units otus at a cutoff of 97 sequence similarity against the silva database version 132 https www arb silva de and unite database version 8 0 https unite ut ee respectively after removing the singleton otus the relative abundances of the bacterial and fungi taxa were determined miseq sequencing for the v3 v4 regions of 16s rdna and its2 regions of fungi of 29 samples yielded 1 273 785 2 and 1 950 636 2 paired end reads respectively to fairly compare samples bacterial and fungal sequences in different samples were normalized based on the minimum sequence number 25 529 and 34561 respectively by randomly extracting sequences in one sample for further analysis alpha diversity beta diversity wilcoxon rank sum test and lefse analysis were performed using the free online platform of majorbio i sanger cloud platform www i sanger com the potential functional microbes were primarily selected based on a previous study table s2 19 2 5 molecular ecological network analysis the phylogenetic molecular ecological networks pmens based on random matrix theory rmt were constructed through an online mena pipeline http ieg4 rccc ou edu mena four networks wtpc bacteria wotpc bacteria wtpc fungi and wotpc fungi using the otu tables of wtpc and wotpc communities were constructed following a previous study 20 absolute correlation values of bacteria greater than 0 890 and 0 860 fungi were 0 39 and 0 32 p 0 05 for each pair of nodes were considered significant in wtpc and wotpc community respectively the greedy modularity optimization was applied to detect modules of mens since it was considered as a robust approach for obtaining the highest modularity value and identifying the submodular structure of ecological networks 21 a total of 100 randomized networks were generated to compare with the topology of the corresponding virtual network by using the maslov sneppen method 22 the small world coefficient was applied to describe the small world property of the networks i e the degree of clustering and shortness of paths between nodes 23 within module degree zi and among module connectivity pi were used to illustrate the topological role of each node the values of 2 5 and 0 62 were adopted as the zi and pi thresholds for species assorting i e peripherals connectors module hubs and network hubs 24 respectively gephi 0 9 2 software was then used for network visualization 25 3 results 3 1 reactor performance the nitrogen and carbon removal performance of the mbr system was investigated for ca 200 days fig 1 no significant differences were found in the effluent concentrations and removal efficiencies of ammonium tn and cod p 0 05 table s3 the average removal rates of ammonium were 95 wtpc and 97 wotpc without any accumulation of nitrite table s3 and the corresponding removal rate of tn were 68 0 and 65 2 p 0 05 respectively the lower tn removal efficiencies likely resulted from the lower influent c n ratio in our system in addition the removal efficiencies of cod were 88 2 and 87 8 p 0 05 respectively besides the mixed liquor suspended solids mlss were 3504 9 914 4 and 2998 8 427 2 mg l p 0 05 and mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss were 2789 7 783 7 and 2398 9 382 4 mg l p 0 05 respectively the higher concentrations of mlss and mlvss in wtpc phase were mainly attributed to the cellulose addition since cellulose was a kind of refractory organic carbon which can be decomposed and volatilized at 250 300 c 26 and thus contribute to both the mlss and mlvss overall there was no significant difference in cod and tn removal efficiencies between two stages mostly attributable to the fact that shift of influent organics had little effect on operation performance under a relatively long hrt i e 12 h in this work 27 as shown in fig s3 there were lower soluble pn and ps in eps and smp in phase wtpc the average concentrations of pn in eps were 37 5 wtpc and 63 0 mg gvss 1 wotpc p 0 05 respectively while ps in eps were 14 8 and 22 5 mg gvss 1 p 0 05 in addition pn in smp were 1 65 and 2 47 mg gvss 1 p 0 05 and ps in smp were 2 14 and 3 22 mg gvss 1 p 0 05 it was expected that in the presence of influent cellulose microbes secreted fewer and or biodegraded more extracellular polymers than those in wotpc 3 2 the response of microbial communities with respect to bacterial community the sobs observed species richness indices reduced from 865 6 wtpc to 760 2 wotpc and shannon indices also decreased from 4 66 to 4 26 as well as the chao index declined from 1111 2 to 993 5 table s4 p 0 05 indicating the declines in bacterial community richness and diversity along the change of feeds as for fungal community the sobs from 61 9 to 63 5 p 0 05 and chao from 73 1 to 79 4 p 0 05 indices were increased while shannon indices decreased from 1 22 to 1 16 p 0 05 denoting the adverse trend between richness and diversity of fungal community as compared to those of bacterial community the dynamics of bacterial communities in the a o mbr reactor were shown in fig 2 the three most abundant bacterial phyla were proteobacteria 39 2 51 0 chloroflexi 25 2 18 7 and bacteroidetes 16 0 15 9 the relative abundance of proteobacteria in wotpc was higher than in wtpc while the relative abundances of chloroflexi and bacteroidetes showed an opposite trend at genus level fig 2c kouleothrix and nitrifying bacteria were declined from wtpc to wotpc implying that these bacteria might be able to utilize refractory carbon or acted as refractory nutrient metabolism associated symbiotic organisms at otu level fig 2d otu 985 kouleothrix and otu 970 nitrospira nob were reduced from wtpc to wotpc while otu 1583 azospira denitrifying bacteria otu 1023 kouleothrix and otu 320 om27 clade showed an opposite trend although both otu 985 and otu 1023 were affiliated with kouleothrix their responses to the change of influent cellulose were different fungus does not occupy a dominant position in the domestic sewage treatment system but it is often used as an additive in the treatment of cellulose containing wastewater to increase the rate of hydrolysis and conversion 8 the dynamics of fungal communities in the mbr were shown in fig 3 unclassified fungi made up most of the fungal communities which was likely due to the lack of reference sequence data eukaryota were the dominated classified phyla followed by basidiomycota and ascomycota during the whole operation period notably basidiomycota and ascomycota which could secrete cellulase 28 were identified as the core phyla that were significantly enriched in wtpc fig 3b and had a significant impact on microbial community differences between wtpc and wotpc fig s4 at genus level fig 3c cutaneotrichosporon 2 49 0 96 cladosporium 0 84 0 02 and apiotrichum 0 46 0 02 were reduced according to the lefse test fig s4 the core genera exophiala 0 01 0 penicillium 0 02 0 01 and fusarium 0 24 0 98 were significantly different between wtpc and wotpc communities at otu level otu 9 class pucciniomycetes 4 80 0 10 and otu 192 phylum ascomycota 2 31 0 00 showed a decline from wtpc to wotpc fig 3d the fungi capable of secreting cellulase such as otu 120 cutaneotrichosporon from 1 58 to 0 79 otu 62 fusarium from 0 22 to 0 97 showed distinct responses to the change of cellulose content overall the influent cellulose could affect the structure and diversity of microbial community 3 3 the variation of core functional communities the change of core functional microbes should be highly related to the presence of influent cellulose according to the lda analysis proteobacteria acidobacteria fimicutes latescibacteria and verrucomicrobia were the core bacteria phyla that differentiated the microbial community structures between two phases fig 4 proteobacteria was reported to utilize low molecular mass oligosaccharides amino acids or more complex substrates 29 the higher relative abundance of proteobacteria in wotpc was highly relevant to the higher proportion of influent low molecular organic matter phylum latescibacteria was one of the core microbe in wotpc capable to secrete eps using multiple carbon sources 30 previous studies have illustrated that many classes from acidobacteria have the genes responsible for degrading complex carbohydrate such as cellulose chitin and starch 31 32 besides microbes from firmicutes and verrucomicrobia were capable of degrading cellulose 33 and both showed higher relative abundances in wtpc noted that members from firmicutes bacteroidetes flavobacterium and saprospiraceae can degrade the eps by secreting polysaccharide and protein hydrolyzing enzymes 34 basidiomycota and ascomycota were the core fungal phyla in wtpc samples both of which were reported to secret cellulase the representative differentially abundant bacterial taxa included

noted that 3 of 16 biomarkers in wtpc were belonged to family rhodocyclaceae most of them are aerobic or denitrifying bacteria found in aquatic habitats members from rhodocyclaceae are capable of utilizing fermentation products 31 35 denitratisoma is highly related to heterotrophic denitrification 36 and dechloromonas is characterized as denitrifying polyphosphate accumulating organisms 37 three genera were belonged to family burkholderiaceae which were likely involved in aromatic compounds degradation 38 diaphorobacter and hydrogenophaga are characterized as denitrifying strains 39 several species belonged to diaphorobacter harbor the ability to perform simultaneous nitrification and denitrification under aerobic conditions 40 while members of rhodocyclaceae and sphaerotilus can utilize a variety of carbon sources including alcohols organic acids and amino acids 41 there were 2 genera belonged to family chitinophagaceae which were involved in nitrogen cycle as well as cellulose degradation 42 terrimonas played positive roles in the reduction of nitrates and accumulation of polyhydroxybutyrate 43 44 in addition members from saprospiraceae can improve the hydrolysis of complex organic compounds especially for protein 41 besides thiobacillus and swb02 were belonged to family hyphomonadaceae thiobacillus is recognized as autotrophic denitrifying bacteria and act as hydrolytic bacteria 36 45 acinetobacter is recognized as heterotrophic nitrification and aerobic denitrification bacteria 37 as well as cellulolytic bacteria 46 mycobacterium can degrade the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon 47 most biomarkers in wtpc were denitrifying and cellulose hydrolyzing microbes suggesting potential synergistic effect between denitrification and cellulose degradation overall the presence of cellulose in mbr system could greatly affect the structure of functional microbes such as carbohydrates nitrogen and eps metabolism associated bacteria potentially influencing the expression of microbial community function 3 4 characteristics of the microbial networks four rmt based networks were constructed to reveal bacterial and fungal interactions the global network topology followed a scale free degree distribution with r 2 being 0 859 0 881 0 258 and 0 061 for wtpc bacteria wotpc bacteria wtpc fungi wotpc fungi respectively most nodes otus of bacterial community in networks had few links while only a few hub nodes had numerous links however most nodes of fungal community in network were highly connected the average clustering coefficient avgcc and harmonic geodesic distance hd of empirical bacterial networks were higher than corresponding random networks table s6 and s7 suggesting that the pmens in bacterial communities possessed small word and modular characteristics 23 the resulting networks consisted of 209 nods linked by 381 edge 48 6 positive and 51 4 negative 332 nodes linked by 1453 edges 80 7 positive and 19 3 negative 51 nodes linked by 696 edges 49 1 positive and 50 9 negative and 61 nodes linked by 820 edges 59 8 positive and 40 2 negative for wtpc bacteria wotpc bacteria wtpc fungi and wotpc fungi network respectively these results indicated that both bacteria and fungi in wtpc community tended to compete more intensively than those in wotpc the bacterial network of wotpc sludge community displayed the higher average connectivity avgk lower harmonic geodesic distance hd and smaller average path distance gd than in wtpc sludge indicating that bacterial interactions in wotpc were intensive than in wtpc additionally the modularity of bacterial network in wotpc sample was smaller than in wtpc to the opposite fungal community network of wtpc showed higher avgk smaller hd and gd than in wotpc table s8 two parameters within module connectivity zi and among module connectivity pi describing the topological roles of nodes were applied for identification of keystone species the topological roles of nodes were illustrated in z p plot fig 5 fig s5 none of network hubs were found in all networks the majority of nodes in all networks were peripherals 95 7 for wtpc bacteria 96 1 for wotpc bacteria and 100 for the two fungi network with most of their links inside their own modules five module hubs otus 970 361 122 253 and 1146 4 connectors otus 363 471 1946 and 885 and 7 module hubs otus 1225 846 1620 1398 728 62 and 531 6 connectors otus 541 1254 159 996 1101 and 461 were considered as keystone taxa in the bacterial networks of wtpc and wotpc respectively none of keystone were shared between the two bacterial networks at the otu and genus levels 9 keystone taxa of wtpc network were affiliated with 7 different phyla table s9 it indicates the central roles of multi species in the a o mbr system with cellulose compound two of 9 otus in wtpc phase i affiliated with phylum acidobacteria were acted as module hub otu361 and connector otu885 respectively these results indicated that otus from the same phyla played different roles in one ecological system seven of the 13 keystone taxa of wotpc network were affiliated with phylum chloroflexi indicating central roles of chloroflexi members in the mbr system in the absence of influent cellulose 4 discussion 4 1 cellulose regulated microbial structure in sludge microbiota in this study the bacterial diversity and species richness of sludge were significantly higher in wtpc phase i than in wotpc phase ii table s3 it was most probably due to the decreased of nutrient diversity from wtpc to wotpc while no significant differences of alpha diversity were found in fungal community change of biodiversity can affect ecosystem functions of microbial community the increase of biodiversity leading to the increase of ecosystem functions and greater biodiversity contribute to the functional redundancy as described in a previous study 48 based on this more bacteria in wtpc with identical functions were more likely to promote interspecies competition this result was supported by the more negative associations in the wtpc networks as revealed by the network analysis fig 5 and s5 in this work contrasting microbial community subjected to different contents of influent cellulose were observed figs 2 and 3 notably members from bacteroidetes considered as primary degraders of polysaccharide can participate in the degradation of cellulose starch long chain fatty acids and other polysaccharide substances 49 it was illustrated that acidobacteria had an important role of biogeochemical cycling of carbon and might be suitable to degrade various carbon sources used in our system 50 both the phyla bacteroidetes and acidobacteria were present in significantly higher abundances p 0 05 in the mbr fed with cellulose than that fed without cellulose exigubacterium which could simultaneously produce alginate lyase and cellulase 51 were significantly enriched in the mbr fed with cellulose all the above findings corroborated that sludge fed with cellulose possessed the higher cellulose degradation potential relative to that fed without cellulose members from phylum latescibacteria are capable to secrete eps using multiple carbon sources 30 the higher abundances of latescibacteria in the sludge fed without cellulose partially explained its higher production of eps and smp fig s3 overall around 9 phyla and 175 genera of bacterial communities showed significant difference between two phases which mainly consisted of denitrifying bacteria and polysaccharide metabolic bacteria basidiomycota and ascomycota were the core fungal phyla leading to the community dissimilarity and both 8 07 vs 1 16 3 12 vs 2 37 had higher relative abundances in wtpc than in wotpc those fungi combined with bacteroidetes were supposed to degrade the eps by secreting hydrolyzing enzymes in the presence of cellulose 4 2 cellulose regulated microbial interactions in sludge microbiota there were clear differences in the composition of specialists especially carbon and nitrogen metabolism related species indicating that cellulose contents played an important role in shaping the ecological structure of the sludge microbiota specifically the keystone taxa forming negative interactions were mainly from otus affiliated with chlamydiae planctomycetes and bacteroidetes in phase wtpc while those in wotpc were mainly from otu531 proteobacteria table s9 intriguingly cellulose metabolic related keystone otus were exclusively found in wtpc suggesting their crucial roles in cellulose metabolism in wtpc previous studies illustrated that the bacterial interactions between species inhibited by significant niche differentiation 6 52 in the pmens of microbial communities the modules could be considered as functional units 53 as well as microbial niches 54 thus the higher modularity of the bacterial community in wtpc might indicate a great extent of niche differentiation suggesting weaker species interactions in wtpc sludge community this was also evidenced by the topological characteristic analysis e g avgk hd moreover the more negative interactions in wtpc bacterial community were associated with competitions for resources and niches under conditions of restricted resource availability 55 56 4 3 implications and research needs from an engineering perspective our results have great implications to the microbial information and operation of biological cellulose containing wastewater treatment e g paper mill wastewater restaurant sewage 57 58 in this study we found that the presence of influent cellulose could improve the relative abundances of cellulolytic populations thus potentially enhancing degradation of membrane foulants e g polysaccharides and benefitting fouling mitigation in mbr processes 59 60 previous studies have illustrated that high treatment efficiency of cellulose waste can be achieved by adding cellulolytic fungi 8 this provides a potential avenue for the treatment of cellulose containing wastewater by adding isolated and modified cellulolytic microbial consortium note also that previous studies have verified that sewage with cellulose as substrate to produce cellulase can reduce the producing cost of cellulase by adding cellulolytic microbes 61 62 of note cellulolytic microbes were enriched in treating cellulose containing wastewater process also increased the cellulose degradation potential of activated sludge fig s6 therefore we can reuse the isolated cellulolytic microbes enriched by our a o mbr to produce secondary products with higher economic value from cellulose containing waste e g cellulase alginates 63 the relative abundances of eps metabolism associated microbial populations were also affected by influent compounds this provides a potential useful strategy to modify the sludge characteristic by adding refractory carbons in addition the keystone species structuring sludge community and the characteristic of interspecific interactions could affect the overall functions of microbial communities 48 64 overall the fundamental understanding of microbial responses to cellulose variations will help us to realize some engineered purposes such as enrichment of cellulolytic microbes production of cellulase and alleviation of membrane fouling 62 65 68 in this work the microbial community in the mbr was analyzed under a well controlled mbr fed with and without cellulose future investigation should focus more on microbial response to influent cellulose fluctuation in the practical wwtp operation in addition previous studies have verified that community characteristics are considerably controlled by operational parameters e g ph do hrt srt 2 27 69 therefore the microbial community succession in a o mbr based process in treating cellulose containing wastewater should take the multiple factors into consideration note also that the change in relative abundance does not completely indicate the increase in the activity of the functional populations future work will focus on the quantitative analysis of functional bacteria and microbial metabolomics analysis to explore the functional expression characteristics of the mbrs for cellulose containing wastewater treatment nevertheless the established approach in this work provided a skeleton for determining the significance of microbial community in treating cellulose containing wastewater and the obtained results highlighted the importance of cellulose content in microbial community succession 5 conclusion in conclusion cellulose is one of the main solid organic carbon in wastewater treatment system wwtp response of microbial community e g biodiversity structure biotic interactions to cellulose is of great significance for understanding the microbial ecology of wwtp this study focused on the shift of microbial community affected by cellulose in an mbr system the main conclusions of this work can be summarized as follows 1 the effect of influent cellulose on the mbr performance was marginal bacterial community subjected to influent cellulose harbored significantly higher diversities than that fed with cellulose free influent 2 community structure was significantly correlated with the change of cellulose contents and the abundance of functional taxa associated to nitrogen and cellulose cycling varied between two phases most of nitrifier and cellulose degrading populations showed higher relative abundance when being fed with cellulose 3 the bacterial community from the mbr fed with cellulose had lower connectivity and higher modularity of networks and more competitive interaction relationship as revealed by the pmens analysis additionally the keystone species were different between two

13441,the roles of influent cellulose in regulating bio system performance and microbial community structure remain largely unknown here we investigated the wastewater treatment performance microbial diversity along with interspecific interaction in a membrane bioreactor mbr in the presence and absence of influent cellulose the results showed that the presence of cellulose did not affect reactor performance significantly including the removal of total nitrogen and organics p 0 05 for both however the absence of influent cellulose decreased the biodiversity of bacterial and fungal community as compared with the presence of cellulose thus the community structure between the two scenarios was significantly different proteobacteria 39 2 51 0 chloroflexi 25 2 18 7 and bacteroidetes 16 0 15 9 were the top 3 dominant phyla and cellulose degrading populations most of which were affiliated with bacteroidetes e g flavobacterium acetobacteroides and firmicutes e g exiguobacterium showed higher relative abundance when being fed with cellulose phylogenetic molecular ecological networks pmens indicated that biotic interactions were weaker in the presence of cellulose and possessed higher proportion of competitive relationships the keystone microbes including nitrogen and cellulose metabolism associated taxa were inconsistent between the two scenarios cellulose decomposer bryobacter and om190 nitrifier nitrospira and denitrifier sulfuritalea were the keystone microbes in the presence of cellulose while the species belonging to chloroflexi anaerolineaceae kouleothrix played important roles in the absence of cellulose this study highlights the important roles of cellulose in shaping microbial community structure and advances our understanding of characteristics of microbial ecology regulated by cellulose in mbr systems keywords cellulose microbial community membrane bioreactor ecological network wastewater treatment 1 introduction cellulose in wastewater treatment plants wwtps mainly originating from the use of toilet paper is a kind of slowly biodegradable organics in 2019 roughly 29 kilotons of toilet paper were used in china every day about 5 88 9 80 kg per person per year 1 and almost all toilet paper ended up being flushed into sewers it was estimated that the toilet paper cellulose fiber was responsible for 30 50 the suspended solids in the sewage 2 it has been observed that 33 84 of toilet paper fibers could enter bio treatment systems of wwtps with primary clarifiers and 55 97 for those without primary clarifiers 2 overall cellulose account for approximately 20 40 of total chemical oxygen demand cod of sewage influent 2 3 given that cellulose is an important fraction of municipal influent understanding the role of influent cellulose in wastewater treatment systems is vital to the operation and optimization of wwtps recent studies have improved our understanding of the effects of cellulose on biodiversity and community structure in natural and engineered ecosystems 4 for instance the roles of cellulose in aquatic soil anaerobic membrane bioreactor and sequencing batch reactor system have been previously studied 2 5 7 and microbial community subjected to different contents of cellulose showed distinct characteristics moreover it has illustrated that cellulose in swage increased the relative abundance of cellulolytic hydrolytic bacteria and change of influent cellulose ratio can shift the structure of cellulolytic species 2 3 8 9 in addition fungal species were observed to play important roles in cellulose degradation in both soil and aquatic systems 9 however there lacks of comprehensive knowledge about the response of bacterial and fungal community to influent cellulose in sewage treatment systems especially in anoxic aerobic membrane bioreactors a o mbrs system which are widely used for sewage treatment moreover the knowledge gaps regarding the roles of influent cellulose in regulating core functional groups ecological network and keystone taxa of activated sludge microbiota remain statistical analyses such as linear discriminant analysis lda can be applied to identify taxa with significantly different levels of abundance and lda effect size lefse analysis can elucidate the potential microbial biomarker expounding differentiate between different groups 10 besides ecological network analysis can characterize the interplay between co occurring species in microbial communities 11 12 enabling identification of the keystone populations crucial for maintaining microbiota structure 12 affirmably the usage of above methods could largely illuminate the role of influent cellulose in shaping microbial community structure and species interactions in sewage treatment ecosystems these knowledge are crucial to better manipulate and optimize the functioning of the biological processes for the cellulose containing wastewater treatment this work aimed to unravel the mechanisms of microbial community shift including biodiversity microbial structure core functional taxa and interspecies interaction driven by cellulose a lab scale a o mbr fed with and without cellulose was operated for a long period and the rector performance i e nutrient and organic removal was monitored regularly the 16s rrna gene and its gene sequencing were conducted to determine the diversity and structure of bacterial and fungal community respectively the lefse analysis was used to unravel the biomarker in different communities i e sludge microbiotas fed with and without cellulose moreover phylogenetic molecular ecological network pmen analyses were performed to decipher the interaction patterns ecological roles of co occurring taxa and thus identify the keystone taxa in microbial communities overall this work is proposed to improve our understanding of microbial ecology in cellulose containing wastewater treatment systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 mbr setup and operation an a o mbr with an effective total volume of 2 3 l 1 3 l for anoxic tank and 1 l for aerobic tank fig s1 in the supplementary information the solids retention time srt and hydraulic retention time hrt were set as 20 d and 12 h respectively a hollow fiber membrane module 0 046 m2 pvdf was submerged in the aerobic tank where aeration rate was set at ca 60 l h to maintain a dissolved oxygen do concentration of 2 0 3 0 mg l the seeding sludge was collected from a full scale wwtp in guangzhou china before the startup of this mbr the seeding sludge was acclimated to a synthetic wastewater table s1 for 30 days sludge recirculation from the aerobic tank to the anoxic tank was set at 200 of the influent flow average concentrations of total chemical oxygen demand tcod total nitrogen tn in the synthetic wastewater with were ca 250 mg l and 30 mg l respectively table s1 in phase i day 0 143 toilet paper cellulose 40 of tcod was added named as wtpc while in phase ii day 144 198 none of extra cellulose was added named as wotpc table s1 2 2 sample collection physical and chemical analyses influents supernatants and membrane effluents were collected regularly for the measurement of water parameters as well as protein and polysaccharide concentrations ammonia nitrogen mlss mlvss cod nitrate nitrogen no3 n nitrite nitrogen no2 n and total nitrogen tn were measured according to standard methods 13 the extraction of soluble microbial products smps and bound extracellular polymeric substances eps followed the modified procedure proposed by a previous study 14 polysaccharide ps and protein pn in eps and smp were determined by phenol sulfuric acid methods 15 and lowry method 16 respectively 2 3 dna extraction pcr amplification and data processing the sampling points of sludge are shown in fig s2 there were 16 samples from wtpc and 13 samples from wotpc resulting in a total of 29 biomass samples for dna extraction and subsequent analysis of microbial communities the e z n a soil dna kit omega bio tek norcross ga usa was used to extract microbial dna according to manufacturer s instructions the final dna concentration and purity were evaluated using a nanodrop 2000 uv vis spectrophotometer thermo scientific wilmington usa and dna quality was assessed by 1 agarose gel electrophoresis the v3 v4 hypervariable regions of the bacterial 16s rrna gene were amplified with 338 f and 806r primers using a thermocycler pcr system geneamp 9700 abi usa while the its2 region of fungi its gene was amplified with its3f and its4r primers pcr reactions were conducted following previous studies 17 18 the resulting pcr products were then extracted by using 2 agarose gel afterwards the pcr products were further purified by the axyprep dna gel extraction kit axygen biosciences union city ca usa and quantified by quantifluor st promega usa following the manufacturer s protocols then amplicons were sequenced on an illumina miseq pe300 platform at the shanghai majorbio bio pharm technology co ltd processing of sequencing data was performed according to previous works 17 18 the raw reads were then deposited into the ncbi sequence read archive database under accession prjna529301 2 4 bioinformatics and statistics analyses the paired end reads were assembled using flash v1 2 11 https ccb jhu edu software flash index shtml the qiime version 1 9 1 was used to filter the paired end reads for quality control to obtain effective tags and align the operational taxonomic units otus at a cutoff of 97 sequence similarity against the silva database version 132 https www arb silva de and unite database version 8 0 https unite ut ee respectively after removing the singleton otus the relative abundances of the bacterial and fungi taxa were determined miseq sequencing for the v3 v4 regions of 16s rdna and its2 regions of fungi of 29 samples yielded 1 273 785 2 and 1 950 636 2 paired end reads respectively to fairly compare samples bacterial and fungal sequences in different samples were normalized based on the minimum sequence number 25 529 and 34561 respectively by randomly extracting sequences in one sample for further analysis alpha diversity beta diversity wilcoxon rank sum test and lefse analysis were performed using the free online platform of majorbio i sanger cloud platform www i sanger com the potential functional microbes were primarily selected based on a previous study table s2 19 2 5 molecular ecological network analysis the phylogenetic molecular ecological networks pmens based on random matrix theory rmt were constructed through an online mena pipeline http ieg4 rccc ou edu mena four networks wtpc bacteria wotpc bacteria wtpc fungi and wotpc fungi using the otu tables of wtpc and wotpc communities were constructed following a previous study 20 absolute correlation values of bacteria greater than 0 890 and 0 860 fungi were 0 39 and 0 32 p 0 05 for each pair of nodes were considered significant in wtpc and wotpc community respectively the greedy modularity optimization was applied to detect modules of mens since it was considered as a robust approach for obtaining the highest modularity value and identifying the submodular structure of ecological networks 21 a total of 100 randomized networks were generated to compare with the topology of the corresponding virtual network by using the maslov sneppen method 22 the small world coefficient was applied to describe the small world property of the networks i e the degree of clustering and shortness of paths between nodes 23 within module degree zi and among module connectivity pi were used to illustrate the topological role of each node the values of 2 5 and 0 62 were adopted as the zi and pi thresholds for species assorting i e peripherals connectors module hubs and network hubs 24 respectively gephi 0 9 2 software was then used for network visualization 25 3 results 3 1 reactor performance the nitrogen and carbon removal performance of the mbr system was investigated for ca 200 days fig 1 no significant differences were found in the effluent concentrations and removal efficiencies of ammonium tn and cod p 0 05 table s3 the average removal rates of ammonium were 95 wtpc and 97 wotpc without any accumulation of nitrite table s3 and the corresponding removal rate of tn were 68 0 and 65 2 p 0 05 respectively the lower tn removal efficiencies likely resulted from the lower influent c n ratio in our system in addition the removal efficiencies of cod were 88 2 and 87 8 p 0 05 respectively besides the mixed liquor suspended solids mlss were 3504 9 914 4 and 2998 8 427 2 mg l p 0 05 and mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss were 2789 7 783 7 and 2398 9 382 4 mg l p 0 05 respectively the higher concentrations of mlss and mlvss in wtpc phase were mainly attributed to the cellulose addition since cellulose was a kind of refractory organic carbon which can be decomposed and volatilized at 250 300 c 26 and thus contribute to both the mlss and mlvss overall there was no significant difference in cod and tn removal efficiencies between two stages mostly attributable to the fact that shift of influent organics had little effect on operation performance under a relatively long hrt i e 12 h in this work 27 as shown in fig s3 there were lower soluble pn and ps in eps and smp in phase wtpc the average concentrations of pn in eps were 37 5 wtpc and 63 0 mg gvss 1 wotpc p 0 05 respectively while ps in eps were 14 8 and 22 5 mg gvss 1 p 0 05 in addition pn in smp were 1 65 and 2 47 mg gvss 1 p 0 05 and ps in smp were 2 14 and 3 22 mg gvss 1 p 0 05 it was expected that in the presence of influent cellulose microbes secreted fewer and or biodegraded more extracellular polymers than those in wotpc 3 2 the response of microbial communities with respect to bacterial community the sobs observed species richness indices reduced from 865 6 wtpc to 760 2 wotpc and shannon indices also decreased from 4 66 to 4 26 as well as the chao index declined from 1111 2 to 993 5 table s4 p 0 05 indicating the declines in bacterial community richness and diversity along the change of feeds as for fungal community the sobs from 61 9 to 63 5 p 0 05 and chao from 73 1 to 79 4 p 0 05 indices were increased while shannon indices decreased from 1 22 to 1 16 p 0 05 denoting the adverse trend between richness and diversity of fungal community as compared to those of bacterial community the dynamics of bacterial communities in the a o mbr reactor were shown in fig 2 the three most abundant bacterial phyla were proteobacteria 39 2 51 0 chloroflexi 25 2 18 7 and bacteroidetes 16 0 15 9 the relative abundance of proteobacteria in wotpc was higher than in wtpc while the relative abundances of chloroflexi and bacteroidetes showed an opposite trend at genus level fig 2c kouleothrix and nitrifying bacteria were declined from wtpc to wotpc implying that these bacteria might be able to utilize refractory carbon or acted as refractory nutrient metabolism associated symbiotic organisms at otu level fig 2d otu 985 kouleothrix and otu 970 nitrospira nob were reduced from wtpc to wotpc while otu 1583 azospira denitrifying bacteria otu 1023 kouleothrix and otu 320 om27 clade showed an opposite trend although both otu 985 and otu 1023 were affiliated with kouleothrix their responses to the change of influent cellulose were different fungus does not occupy a dominant position in the domestic sewage treatment system but it is often used as an additive in the treatment of cellulose containing wastewater to increase the rate of hydrolysis and conversion 8 the dynamics of fungal communities in the mbr were shown in fig 3 unclassified fungi made up most of the fungal communities which was likely due to the lack of reference sequence data eukaryota were the dominated classified phyla followed by basidiomycota and ascomycota during the whole operation period notably basidiomycota and ascomycota which could secrete cellulase 28 were identified as the core phyla that were significantly enriched in wtpc fig 3b and had a significant impact on microbial community differences between wtpc and wotpc fig s4 at genus level fig 3c cutaneotrichosporon 2 49 0 96 cladosporium 0 84 0 02 and apiotrichum 0 46 0 02 were reduced according to the lefse test fig s4 the core genera exophiala 0 01 0 penicillium 0 02 0 01 and fusarium 0 24 0 98 were significantly different between wtpc and wotpc communities at otu level otu 9 class pucciniomycetes 4 80 0 10 and otu 192 phylum ascomycota 2 31 0 00 showed a decline from wtpc to wotpc fig 3d the fungi capable of secreting cellulase such as otu 120 cutaneotrichosporon from 1 58 to 0 79 otu 62 fusarium from 0 22 to 0 97 showed distinct responses to the change of cellulose content overall the influent cellulose could affect the structure and diversity of microbial community 3 3 the variation of core functional communities the change of core functional microbes should be highly related to the presence of influent cellulose according to the lda analysis proteobacteria acidobacteria fimicutes latescibacteria and verrucomicrobia were the core bacteria phyla that differentiated the microbial community structures between two phases fig 4 proteobacteria was reported to utilize low molecular mass oligosaccharides amino acids or more complex substrates 29 the higher relative abundance of proteobacteria in wotpc was highly relevant to the higher proportion of influent low molecular organic matter phylum latescibacteria was one of the core microbe in wotpc capable to secrete eps using multiple carbon sources 30 previous studies have illustrated that many classes from acidobacteria have the genes responsible for degrading complex carbohydrate such as cellulose chitin and starch 31 32 besides microbes from firmicutes and verrucomicrobia were capable of degrading cellulose 33 and both showed higher relative abundances in wtpc noted that members from firmicutes bacteroidetes flavobacterium and saprospiraceae can degrade the eps by secreting polysaccharide and protein hydrolyzing enzymes 34 basidiomycota and ascomycota were the core fungal phyla in wtpc samples both of which were reported to secret cellulase the representative differentially abundant bacterial taxa included

noted that 3 of 16 biomarkers in wtpc were belonged to family rhodocyclaceae most of them are aerobic or denitrifying bacteria found in aquatic habitats members from rhodocyclaceae are capable of utilizing fermentation products 31 35 denitratisoma is highly related to heterotrophic denitrification 36 and dechloromonas is characterized as denitrifying polyphosphate accumulating organisms 37 three genera were belonged to family burkholderiaceae which were likely involved in aromatic compounds degradation 38 diaphorobacter and hydrogenophaga are characterized as denitrifying strains 39 several species belonged to diaphorobacter harbor the ability to perform simultaneous nitrification and denitrification under aerobic conditions 40 while members of rhodocyclaceae and sphaerotilus can utilize a variety of carbon sources including alcohols organic acids and amino acids 41 there were 2 genera belonged to family chitinophagaceae which were involved in nitrogen cycle as well as cellulose degradation 42 terrimonas played positive roles in the reduction of nitrates and accumulation of polyhydroxybutyrate 43 44 in addition members from saprospiraceae can improve the hydrolysis of complex organic compounds especially for protein 41 besides thiobacillus and swb02 were belonged to family hyphomonadaceae thiobacillus is recognized as autotrophic denitrifying bacteria and act as hydrolytic bacteria 36 45 acinetobacter is recognized as heterotrophic nitrification and aerobic denitrification bacteria 37 as well as cellulolytic bacteria 46 mycobacterium can degrade the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon 47 most biomarkers in wtpc were denitrifying and cellulose hydrolyzing microbes suggesting potential synergistic effect between denitrification and cellulose degradation overall the presence of cellulose in mbr system could greatly affect the structure of functional microbes such as carbohydrates nitrogen and eps metabolism associated bacteria potentially influencing the expression of microbial community function 3 4 characteristics of the microbial networks four rmt based networks were constructed to reveal bacterial and fungal interactions the global network topology followed a scale free degree distribution with r 2 being 0 859 0 881 0 258 and 0 061 for wtpc bacteria wotpc bacteria wtpc fungi wotpc fungi respectively most nodes otus of bacterial community in networks had few links while only a few hub nodes had numerous links however most nodes of fungal community in network were highly connected the average clustering coefficient avgcc and harmonic geodesic distance hd of empirical bacterial networks were higher than corresponding random networks table s6 and s7 suggesting that the pmens in bacterial communities possessed small word and modular characteristics 23 the resulting networks consisted of 209 nods linked by 381 edge 48 6 positive and 51 4 negative 332 nodes linked by 1453 edges 80 7 positive and 19 3 negative 51 nodes linked by 696 edges 49 1 positive and 50 9 negative and 61 nodes linked by 820 edges 59 8 positive and 40 2 negative for wtpc bacteria wotpc bacteria wtpc fungi and wotpc fungi network respectively these results indicated that both bacteria and fungi in wtpc community tended to compete more intensively than those in wotpc the bacterial network of wotpc sludge community displayed the higher average connectivity avgk lower harmonic geodesic distance hd and smaller average path distance gd than in wtpc sludge indicating that bacterial interactions in wotpc were intensive than in wtpc additionally the modularity of bacterial network in wotpc sample was smaller than in wtpc to the opposite fungal community network of wtpc showed higher avgk smaller hd and gd than in wotpc table s8 two parameters within module connectivity zi and among module connectivity pi describing the topological roles of nodes were applied for identification of keystone species the topological roles of nodes were illustrated in z p plot fig 5 fig s5 none of network hubs were found in all networks the majority of nodes in all networks were peripherals 95 7 for wtpc bacteria 96 1 for wotpc bacteria and 100 for the two fungi network with most of their links inside their own modules five module hubs otus 970 361 122 253 and 1146 4 connectors otus 363 471 1946 and 885 and 7 module hubs otus 1225 846 1620 1398 728 62 and 531 6 connectors otus 541 1254 159 996 1101 and 461 were considered as keystone taxa in the bacterial networks of wtpc and wotpc respectively none of keystone were shared between the two bacterial networks at the otu and genus levels 9 keystone taxa of wtpc network were affiliated with 7 different phyla table s9 it indicates the central roles of multi species in the a o mbr system with cellulose compound two of 9 otus in wtpc phase i affiliated with phylum acidobacteria were acted as module hub otu361 and connector otu885 respectively these results indicated that otus from the same phyla played different roles in one ecological system seven of the 13 keystone taxa of wotpc network were affiliated with phylum chloroflexi indicating central roles of chloroflexi members in the mbr system in the absence of influent cellulose 4 discussion 4 1 cellulose regulated microbial structure in sludge microbiota in this study the bacterial diversity and species richness of sludge were significantly higher in wtpc phase i than in wotpc phase ii table s3 it was most probably due to the decreased of nutrient diversity from wtpc to wotpc while no significant differences of alpha diversity were found in fungal community change of biodiversity can affect ecosystem functions of microbial community the increase of biodiversity leading to the increase of ecosystem functions and greater biodiversity contribute to the functional redundancy as described in a previous study 48 based on this more bacteria in wtpc with identical functions were more likely to promote interspecies competition this result was supported by the more negative associations in the wtpc networks as revealed by the network analysis fig 5 and s5 in this work contrasting microbial community subjected to different contents of influent cellulose were observed figs 2 and 3 notably members from bacteroidetes considered as primary degraders of polysaccharide can participate in the degradation of cellulose starch long chain fatty acids and other polysaccharide substances 49 it was illustrated that acidobacteria had an important role of biogeochemical cycling of carbon and might be suitable to degrade various carbon sources used in our system 50 both the phyla bacteroidetes and acidobacteria were present in significantly higher abundances p 0 05 in the mbr fed with cellulose than that fed without cellulose exigubacterium which could simultaneously produce alginate lyase and cellulase 51 were significantly enriched in the mbr fed with cellulose all the above findings corroborated that sludge fed with cellulose possessed the higher cellulose degradation potential relative to that fed without cellulose members from phylum latescibacteria are capable to secrete eps using multiple carbon sources 30 the higher abundances of latescibacteria in the sludge fed without cellulose partially explained its higher production of eps and smp fig s3 overall around 9 phyla and 175 genera of bacterial communities showed significant difference between two phases which mainly consisted of denitrifying bacteria and polysaccharide metabolic bacteria basidiomycota and ascomycota were the core fungal phyla leading to the community dissimilarity and both 8 07 vs 1 16 3 12 vs 2 37 had higher relative abundances in wtpc than in wotpc those fungi combined with bacteroidetes were supposed to degrade the eps by secreting hydrolyzing enzymes in the presence of cellulose 4 2 cellulose regulated microbial interactions in sludge microbiota there were clear differences in the composition of specialists especially carbon and nitrogen metabolism related species indicating that cellulose contents played an important role in shaping the ecological structure of the sludge microbiota specifically the keystone taxa forming negative interactions were mainly from otus affiliated with chlamydiae planctomycetes and bacteroidetes in phase wtpc while those in wotpc were mainly from otu531 proteobacteria table s9 intriguingly cellulose metabolic related keystone otus were exclusively found in wtpc suggesting their crucial roles in cellulose metabolism in wtpc previous studies illustrated that the bacterial interactions between species inhibited by significant niche differentiation 6 52 in the pmens of microbial communities the modules could be considered as functional units 53 as well as microbial niches 54 thus the higher modularity of the bacterial community in wtpc might indicate a great extent of niche differentiation suggesting weaker species interactions in wtpc sludge community this was also evidenced by the topological characteristic analysis e g avgk hd moreover the more negative interactions in wtpc bacterial community were associated with competitions for resources and niches under conditions of restricted resource availability 55 56 4 3 implications and research needs from an engineering perspective our results have great implications to the microbial information and operation of biological cellulose containing wastewater treatment e g paper mill wastewater restaurant sewage 57 58 in this study we found that the presence of influent cellulose could improve the relative abundances of cellulolytic populations thus potentially enhancing degradation of membrane foulants e g polysaccharides and benefitting fouling mitigation in mbr processes 59 60 previous studies have illustrated that high treatment efficiency of cellulose waste can be achieved by adding cellulolytic fungi 8 this provides a potential avenue for the treatment of cellulose containing wastewater by adding isolated and modified cellulolytic microbial consortium note also that previous studies have verified that sewage with cellulose as substrate to produce cellulase can reduce the producing cost of cellulase by adding cellulolytic microbes 61 62 of note cellulolytic microbes were enriched in treating cellulose containing wastewater process also increased the cellulose degradation potential of activated sludge fig s6 therefore we can reuse the isolated cellulolytic microbes enriched by our a o mbr to produce secondary products with higher economic value from cellulose containing waste e g cellulase alginates 63 the relative abundances of eps metabolism associated microbial populations were also affected by influent compounds this provides a potential useful strategy to modify the sludge characteristic by adding refractory carbons in addition the keystone species structuring sludge community and the characteristic of interspecific interactions could affect the overall functions of microbial communities 48 64 overall the fundamental understanding of microbial responses to cellulose variations will help us to realize some engineered purposes such as enrichment of cellulolytic microbes production of cellulase and alleviation of membrane fouling 62 65 68 in this work the microbial community in the mbr was analyzed under a well controlled mbr fed with and without cellulose future investigation should focus more on microbial response to influent cellulose fluctuation in the practical wwtp operation in addition previous studies have verified that community characteristics are considerably controlled by operational parameters e g ph do hrt srt 2 27 69 therefore the microbial community succession in a o mbr based process in treating cellulose containing wastewater should take the multiple factors into consideration note also that the change in relative abundance does not completely indicate the increase in the activity of the functional populations future work will focus on the quantitative analysis of functional bacteria and microbial metabolomics analysis to explore the functional expression characteristics of the mbrs for cellulose containing wastewater treatment nevertheless the established approach in this work provided a skeleton for determining the significance of microbial community in treating cellulose containing wastewater and the obtained results highlighted the importance of cellulose content in microbial community succession 5 conclusion in conclusion cellulose is one of the main solid organic carbon in wastewater treatment system wwtp response of microbial community e g biodiversity structure biotic interactions to cellulose is of great significance for understanding the microbial ecology of wwtp this study focused on the shift of microbial community affected by cellulose in an mbr system the main conclusions of this work can be summarized as follows 1 the effect of influent cellulose on the mbr performance was marginal bacterial community subjected to influent cellulose harbored significantly higher diversities than that fed with cellulose free influent 2 community structure was significantly correlated with the change of cellulose contents and the abundance of functional taxa associated to nitrogen and cellulose cycling varied between two phases most of nitrifier and cellulose degrading populations showed higher relative abundance when being fed with cellulose 3 the bacterial community from the mbr fed with cellulose had lower connectivity and higher modularity of networks and more competitive interaction relationship as revealed by the pmens analysis additionally the keystone species were different between two

13442,this study presents a simple method for facile synthesis of core shell microspheres of graphene oxide mno2 goethite go mno2 goe synthesised go was used as the core material for treatment with the pre decided molar ratio mixture of fe and mn to form a mno2 goe shell over the go surface optimising various parameters subsequently the go mno2 goe nanoparticles were impregnated into alginate polymer to form go mno2 goethite impregnated alginate hydrogel beads go mno2 goe ca alg using displacement reaction the product was characterized by xrd ftir bet sem eds and zeta potential measurement the go mno2 goe ca alg hybrid nanosorbent was used to efficiently remove both arsenic iii and arsenic v from groundwater 80 96 for 0 1 100 Î¼g ml 1 concentration range at ph 4 6 uptake processes for both as iii and as v followed langmuir isotherm model with maximum sorption capacity evaluated as 27 53 and 34 17 mg g 1 respectively for as iii and as v the reaction kinetics thermodynamic parameters interparticle diffusion model were studied mechanism of uptake was suggested based on fraction diagram of as iii and as v species along with zeta potential of go mno2 goe at various ph the in situ transformation of as iii to as v before its sorption was investigated and explained with the help of xps analysis keywords graphene oxide goethite mno2 hybrid material calcium alginate arsenic 1 introduction water pollution has become a serious issue worldwide one of the most common source of groundwater pollution is through arsenic contamination several areas in world have reported for high arsenic concentrations in groundwater 1 2 which include large and highly populated countries like china india usa canada mexico japan bangladesh etc 3 4 because of highly toxicity and carcinogenicity world health organization has set the prescribed limit for as in potable water as 10 Î¼g l 1 5 6 in natural groundwater arsenic is present in various forms like particulate matter soluble component organic bound material 7 in nature arsenic occurs in both trivalent as iii and pentavalent as v states driven by redox potential of the medium both the oxidation states are frequently observed because redox transformations of arsenic species are relatively slow ph and eh redox potential have great impact on arsenic speciation 8 9 arsenic speciation with predominant species at different ph h3aso3 h3aso4 h3aso3 2 h3aso4 2 h3aso4 aso4 3 etc has been extensively discussed in literature 10 11 new technologies and materials are constantly being evolved by researchers worldwide to tackle water pollution from contaminants of various kinds including trace and toxic elements organic dyes radioactive materials 12 13 earlier investigated technologies for arsenic removal from potable water include adsorption coagulation sedimentation ion exchange nano and ultra filtration reverse osmosis 10 14 15 materials such as activated charcoal alumina alum ferric hydroxide iron oxy hydroxides various biomasses have been reported for arsenic decontamination from ground water 16 17 but to bring down arsenic concentration below 10 Î¼g l 1 many of these reported materials displayed low capacity some materials work at extreme ph condition some are prone to release their chemical constituents in water leading to further pollution of water a major constrain is that most of the reported materials and technologies available are for only as v removal form groundwater 18 21 as iii because of its neutral nature at ambient ph is not removed by these sorbents few methods suggest as iii oxidation in a separate pre treatment method to as v which increase the naoh koh and hno3 hcl load on the water processes involving ion exchange reverse osmosis nano ultrafiltration are not cost effective as they need regular maintenance and change of costly consumable components iron oxide hydroxide oxy hydroxide based sorbents are very efficient in the removal of arsenic and many other heavy elements arsenic can be coprecipitated along iron oxides and hydroxides from groundwater 22 24 utilising nanocrystals of iron oxides e g magnetite hematite goethite etc or in form of nano composites not only increase its removal efficiency but also reduce the waste generation because of high specific surface area 4 25 goethite feooh which is iron iii oxy hydroxide is susceptible to redox reaction and hydroxides formation being triggered by ph change or atmospheric exposure to overcome this issue researchers have attached these iron oxide nanoparticles with polymeric matrix carbon based materials like activated carbon graphene oxide go cnt 26 29 graphene oxide go is potentially a good supporting material for iron oxides or oxy hydroxides because of monolayer sheet like structure of sp2 hybridised carbon in hexagonal array with intermittently attached functional groups on surfaces properties like high thermal electrical conductivity very high surface area etc attracted researchers to explore its potential as a sorbing media or as a constituent of hybrid material along with its other application in electronics sensing catalysis etc 30 33 in recent years a number of studies have been carried out on utilisation of graphene or modified graphene composites for removal of verities of pollutants from water 34 40 to address the issue of difficulties in removal of as iii the use of binary oxide or oxide oxy hydroxide comprising manganese oxide mno2 and goethite iron oxy hydroxide have been proposed here mno2 acts as an oxidant and goethite functions as a sorbent for arsenic mno2 has been studied for oxidation of as iii to as v while mno2 itself being reduced to mn iii or mn ii but it is not a good absorber for arsenic 21 41 43 mn fe binary mixture in mno2 goethite form can be proved to be an efficient sorbent for both as iii and as v for as v goethite can directly function for sorption whereas for as iii mno2 fraction can promote its oxidation followed by sorption by goethite fusing this binary mixture mno2 goethite with go provide important advantages properties of go can be utilised by judiciously placing the mno2 goethite in the nano composite structure 20 21 44 45 it can be formed as a core shell composite with high surface area adjustable pore structure and narrow distribution of sizes 46 49 suitable properties of mno2 goethite and go have motivated us to make a core shell hybrid microspheres involving them for the as iii and as v removal application these core shell nanosorbents are however difficult to be separated from water and to be employed in column method due to extremely small particle size if the core shell nano composite can be tailored to a different matrix without any compromise on its effectiveness it can be easier for practical application alginate being a polysaccharide is a good candidate in this regard 50 52 many earlier studies including ours have used alginate for immobilisation of suitable nanosorbent because of the ability of alginate to form stable gel at room formation through crosslinking the guluronate moieties of alginate chain with the divalent cations ca ba sr etc 53 55 in this study we report facile synthesis of core shell microspheres of go mno2 goethite go mno2 goe and subsequent impregnation into alginate to form go mno2 goethite impregnated alginate hydrogel beads go mno2 goe ca alg optimising various parameters developed hybrid hydrogel beads were characterised using various techniques ftir sem eds xrd bet the go mno2 goe ca alg beads were utilised for removal of both as ii and as v from groundwater 0 1 100 Î¼gml 1 ph 4 6 without affecting the water quality index impact of various parameters on as uptake were studied and sorption capacity was evaluated the sorption data was fitted into suitable isotherm kinetic and inter particle diffusion models the mechanism was suggested by understanding the interaction of as iii and as v species with go and mno2 goethite layers in the core shell nanocomposites 2 experimental 2 1 reagents all reagents used were analytical grade sigma aldrich demineralised water with resistivity 0 01 Î¼s cm 1 and doc 5 ng ml 1 was used for preparation of solutions experimental as iii solution was prepared by dissolving naaso2 and as v solution was prepared by dissolving na2haso4 7h2o in nitric acid arsenic as standard stock solutions in hno3 sigma aldrich was used for preparation calibration standards ph modification of the experimental simulated solutions was carried out using hno3 and naoh 2 2 synthesis the synthesis of the hydrogel go mno2 goethite core shell microsphere loaded alginate hydrogel was carried out as follows 2 2 1 synthesis of graphene oxide go graphene oxide go was synthesized following modified hummers method 28 56 57 this method is most widely accepted fast and efficient for pure go synthesis graphite powder is treated with h2so4 and kmno4 to exfoliate the graphite layer structure followed by reduction of excess kmno4 using h2o2 the formed go was separated using pressurised ultrafiltration system millipore 2 l high pressure cell with 10000d nmwl membrane and subsequently washed the details of the synthesis procedure are discussed in the electronic supplementary material 2 2 2 synthesis of go mno2 goethite microsphere go mno2 geo the dried go powder was used as the core material for the synthesis of graphene oxide mno2 goethite go mno2 geo core shell particles 1 0 g go particle was suspended in 25 ml water using ultrasonication retsch ur1 and heated at 60 c under magnetic stirring at 600 rpm the ph was adjusted in acidic range ph 3 4 a pre decided molar ratio mixture of fe as fecl2 and mn as kmno4 solution was added slowly to the go suspension at 60 c and under continuous stirring 400 rpm fe mn molar ratio was varied from 0 to 8 the reaction was allowed to continue at 60 c for 1 h then allowed to cool at room temperature go mno2 geo core shell particles were formed 21 46 48 particles were separated using ultrafiltration system 10000d nmwl membrane and washed thoroughly with water before drying them in an oven at 60 70 c for 24 h on 01e jeio tech oven 2 2 3 synthesis of go mno2 goethite microsphere impregnated alginate go mno2 goe ca alg beads prepared go mno2 geo was loaded into alginate matrix to form mno2 goethite microsphere impregnated alginate go mno2 goe ca alg hydrogel beads synthesized go mno2 geo powder was mixed at varied proportion to 3 na alginate solution the mixture was thoroughly homogenised stirring at 1200 rpm 3 h and was dropped with the help of a peristaltic pump into 4 w v calcium chloride through displacement reaction of na alginate with calcium chloride hydrogel beads of go mno2

quantification of arsenic inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp oes from thermo scientific model icap 6000 was used for determination of arsenic concentration in Î¼gml 1 range

prepared as iii and as v stock solutions into demineralised water for specific requirements groundwater samples were however used locally collected groundwater samples from mumbai india containing no arsenic 1 ng ml 1 was used and spiked with arsenic as per requirement all the groundwater samples collected were filtered through 0 45 Î¼m paper prior to their use in the laboratory various physicochemical parameters like ph conductivity redox behaviour were monitored using pico lab india ph and conductivity meter major anion and cation were analysed by ion chromatography whereas trace and heavy metals were analysed by icp oes 2 6 uptake experiment arsenic sorption studies on go mno2 goe ca alg beads was carried out in batch experiment method predecided amount of arsenic was added into pre cleaned dry borosilicate glass bottles ph adjusted measured quantity of go mno2 goe ca alg beads were added to it sets were kept on an orbital shaker spinix tarson with pulse shaking mode on till equilibrium is established between the sorbent and arsenic after separation of go mno2 goe ca alg beads arsenic concentration was measured and uptake quantity was calculated detailed equation is given in supplementary information for the effect of contact time fixed go mno2 goe ca alg beads amount and arsenic concentration were maintained and contact time was varied gradually 2 7 kinetics isotherm and thermodynamics study optimum amount of go mno2 goe ca alg beads was allowed to be in contact to known arsenic concentration for a pre determined varying time interval for the kinetics study for isotherm evaluation different arsenic concentrations were kept in contact with go mno2 goe ca alg beads till equilibrium is established final arsenic concentrations were measured kinetics experiment was carried out at three different ambient temperatures 277 0 5 k 298 0 5 k and 328 0 5 k temperatures were maintained separately for the batches 3 results and discussion 3 1 synthesis and characterization go mno2 goe was characterised before its impregnating into alginate matrix developed go mno2 goe ca alg hydrogel beads was also characterised 3 1 1 go first the synthesised go through chemical exfoliation of graphite modified hummers method was characterised by recording its xrd and ftir in the xrd pattern of go 001 crystal plane was evident fig 1 the spacing evaluated was 8 31 Ã¥ which is typical value for go 30 ftir spectrum in fig 2 shows the signature of go vibrational peaks at 1084 cm 1 and 1387 cm 1 were observed due to co and characteristic vibration of cc oh were observed at 1627 cm 1 and 3434 cm 1 respectively 58 59 3 1 2 go mno2 goe in the next step core shell particles of go mno2 goe were formed schematic of which is shown in fig 3 go was used as a support for immobilizing the production of reaction between kmno4 and fecl2 to prevent iron hydroxide precipitation and oxidation the ph of go suspension was pre adjusted to ph 3 4 mno4 and fe ii molar ratio played an important role for the formation of iron oxy hydroxide goethite feooh kmno4 concentration was fixed at 0 1 m for 1 g of go fe ii concentration was varied varying the fe mn molar ratio from 0 to 8 it was observed that when the molar ratio was 3 the mno2 goe binary oxide oxy hydroxide was formed in the first step of reduction of mno4 by fe2 mno2 goe is perfectly formed equ 1 1 go 3 fec l 2

desired product equ 2 at molar ratio 3 mno2 and goethite co precipitated on go surface to form the binary oxide oxy hydroxide immobilised go microspheres the xrd of the go mno2 goe confirms the formation of the same with the phases of go Î± mno2 and Î± goethite being clearly identified fig 4 atr ftir of the formed product vibration showed peaks at 538 cm 1 which is characteristic mn o stretching vibration in mno2 51 60 62 peaks at 799 cm 1 and 900 cm 1 are due to the hydroxyl deformation fe oh of goethite 4 51 63 64 and a single peak at 1084 cm 1 is due to co vibration in go 58 59 fig 5 the size of the go mno2 goe particles was in the range of 60 310 nm with a mean diameter of 104 nm as seen in the size number distribution provided in fig 6 derived from dls measurement this size is higher compared to the size of the go particle 50 210 nm fig 6 which is because of the growth of mno2 goe binary oxide oxy hydroxide over the go sheet bet analysis showed a surface area of this microspheres as 372 6 m2 g 1 bet plot is provided in the supplementary material fig s1 3 1 3 go mno2 goe ca alg hydrogel beads go mno2 goe particles were immobilised in calcium alginate polymeric matrix during calcium alginate formation from sodium alginate solution through displacement reaction go mno2 goe particles were impregnated uniformly in the hydrogel beads size of the formed go mno2 goe ca alg hydrogel beads was 1 9 0 1 mm digital image of the beads is presented in fig 7 uniform size and spherical shape of go mno2 goe ca alg beads was maintained by precisely controlling the addition rate of go mno2 goe and sodium alginate homogenised mixture through a 1 5 mm diameter tube to calcium chloride solution bet surface area analysis of go mno2 goe ca alg beads yielded 169 3 m2 g 1 specific surface area which is significantly less than the go mno2 goe microspheres bet plot is provided in supplementary material fig s2 recorded sem images of go mno2 goe ca alg beads fig 8 showed porous surface structure with surface deposition of mno2 crystals which is clearly visible in the magnified image fig 8 composition of the go mno2 goe ca alg beads was optimised it was found that optimised loading of go mno2 goe was 21 in 3 calcium alginate hydrogels for further verification of the composition of hydrogel beads water content was analysis gave a value of 75 77 which is the reason behind high permeability of the beads chemical analysis of the dried residue of the beads suggested presence of ca mn fe analysed through icp oes and low z elements like c o n h using elemental analyzer euroea optimisation details and the stability check of go mno2 goe ca alg beads have been presented in the supplementary material 3 2 uptake of as iii and as v by go mno2 goe ca alg beads prepared and characterised go mno2 goe ca alg beads were utilised for the uptake of as iii and as v effects of various parameters like initial concentration ph contact time temperature are disused here 3 2 1 effect of initial concentration of as iii and as v sorption of as both as iii and as v by go mno2 goe ca alg beads was studied for initial concentration range of 0 1 100 Î¼g ml 1 keeping the bead dose constant at 5 mg ml 1 results of uptake are given in fig 9 it shows more than 90 uptake of as v for initial concentration range of 0 1 10 Î¼g ml 1 thereafter it slightly reduces due to gradual occupancy of limited number of sites available in the beads with increase in input arsenic concentrations fig 9 also shows the uptake of as iii at different concentrations it was observed that the uptake of as iii was 85 95 for 0 1 10 Î¼g ml 1 and thereafter it reduces the slightly lesser uptake of as iii was observed compared to as v irrespective of initial concentration this is because of the involvement of mno2 reduction mechanism in case of as iii prior to interaction with goethite in case of as v its direct interaction of as v with goethite the standard deviation of the percentage uptake depicted as error bars in fig 9 and other subsequent figs were derived from five identical samples analysis 3 2 2 comparison of individual components a comparison on percentage uptake of as iii and as v by different combinations of the components of the go mno2 goe ca alg beads are plotted in fig 10 initial concentration 10 Î¼g ml 1 contact time 24 h dose rate 5 mg ml 1 ph 6 7 for pure ca alg and go ca alg beads uptake for both as iii and as v were as low as 20 and 25 respectively for go mno2 ca alg beads uptake was 30 for both as iii and as v suggesting minimal role of mno2 for uptake in case of go goe ca alg beads uptake is substantially high for as v but low for as iii confirming the role of mno2 for the oxidation of as iii and goethite for uptake of as v for go mno2 goe ca alg beads and go mno2 goe powder uptake was very high as also observed for the beads in fig 9 and go mno2 goe powder can alone be used for both as iii and as v uptake but hydrogel beads are preferred over powder due to easy isolation and low leachability 3 2 3 effect of ph on uptake fig 11 shows the percentage uptake of both as iii and as v with respect to ph of the medium medium ph was artificially maintained at different values from ph 1 to ph 10 keeping other parameters constant initial concentration 10 Î¼g ml 1 contact time 24 h 1 mg ml 1 results showed that uptake was maximum in ph range 4 6 for as v and as iii also followed almost the similar trend the fig 11 also provides the zeta potential of go and go mno2 goe zeta potential values of sorbent at different ph and the as iii and as v speciation diagrams help to understand the mechanism which are discussed in details in latter parts the reason behind similar trend of as iii and as v is basically conversion of as iii to as v by mno2 prior to its sorption by goethite 3 2 4 effect of time and temperature on uptake equilibrium time for as iii and as v uptake go mno2 goe ca alg beads was optimised keeping initial concentration 10 Î¼g ml 1 contact time 24 h dose rate 1 mg ml 1 and ph 5 the batches were thermally equilibrated at three different temperatures 277 k 298 k and 325 k fig 12 shows that percentage uptake of both as iii and as v increases with increase in equilibration time till 5 h before it saturates although the trend is similar for all three thermal conditions but the uptake percentages differ which is used to evaluate thermodynamic parameters experimental equilibrium time was fixed at 5 h for sufficient uptake of as iii and as v to take place slow diffusion of arsenic species into polymeric hydrogel matrix to interact with go mno2 goe is responsible for moderate equilibrium time 3 3 isotherm study sorption data of both as iii and as v at stp 298 k 1 atm were used to fit them into a suitable isotherm model two extensively used isotherm models for understanding the interaction of solute and sorbent namely langmuir and freundlich models 48 65 66 were tested details of these models to illustrate the sorption are discussed in literature including our earlier works 48 65 67 if qe is equilibrium arsenic concentration in sorbent and ce is equilibrium arsenic concentration in solution the langmuir equ 3 and freundlich equ 4 isotherm model are as follows 3 q e q 0 b c e 1 b c e 4 q e k c e 1 n these two isotherms of arsenic sorption on go mno2 goe ca alg beads are plotted in fig 13 a and b for as iii and as v respectively both the sorption were seen to follow the langmuir model with adjusted r2 values of 0 92 and 0 95 respectively sorption capacity q0 of go mno2 goe ca alg beads for as iii and as v were evaluated from langmuir model the values were 28 53 mgg 1 and 34 17 mgg 1 respectively for as iii and as v the parameters evaluated from the isotherm models are presented in table 1 3 4 kinetics study two basic kinetic models pseudo first and pseudo second order were tested the sorption data of as iii and as v at room temperature as plotted in fig 12a and b were used for the fitting points beyond saturation were not considered to get a true nature of the fitting the kinetic analysis shows that the sorption of both as iii and as v on go mno2 goe ca alg beads followed pseudo first order model with the adjusted r2 values of 0 9807 and 0 9812 respectively fig 14 a and b for pseudo second order model adjusted r2 values were not satisfactory 0 8676 and 0 8934 for as iii and as v respectively pseudo second order kinetic plot is provided in supplementary information fig s3a and s3b the kinetic equations along with the evaluated parameters like rate constants are provided in table 2 3 5 thermodynamics study sorption is normally dependent on the temperature it is clear from fig 12a and b that sorption percentages for both as iii and as v by go mno2 goe ca alg beads increases with increase in the experimental temperature three different isothermal conditions at 4 k 298 k and 333 k were maintained the results indicate that both as iii and as v uptake by go mno2 goe ca alg beads were endothermic in nature which may be attributed to the enhancement in the rate of interparticle diffusion of arsenic species into the beads gibb s free energy Î´g0 can be calculated from the kinetic data to get an idea about spontaneity of as iii and as v uptake by the go mno2 goe ca alg beads the following equation equ 5 is used 56 5 Î´g0 rt ln k the equilibrium constant at 298 k k is calculated for as iii and as v sorption by go mno2 goe ca alg beads k evaluated and r universal gas constant value of 8 314 j mol 1 k 1 are used to calculate Î´g0 Î´g0 values were evaluated as 20 54 kj mol 1 for as iii sorption and 22 32 kj mol 1 for as v sorption suggesting both the sorption reactions were spontaneous 3 6 diffusion modelling the process of uptake of arsenic in go mno2 goe ca alg hydrogel beads may occur in single step or may involve multiple steps to understand it better intraparticle diffusion model weber morris equation equ 6 was utilised where ki is rate constant for diffusion mg g 1 h1 2 and c mg g 1 is constant but dependent on boundary layer thickness 68 70 6 q t k i t 1 2 c positive slope suggests favourable adsorption as plotted in fig 15 both the as iii and as v uptake on go mno2 goe ca alg beads occur in three steps first two parts having positive slopes probably due to the interaction of the arsenic species with the outer alginate polymer and due to interaction with the active ingredients mno2 goethite composite third part of the plot fig 15 is having zero slope suggesting saturation of as iii and as v uptake 3 7 xps analysis to understand the uptake mechanism of both as iii and as v uptake by the go mno2 goe ca alg beads the samples were subjected to xps analysis go mno2 goe saturated with as iii and as v separately were analysed fig 16 shows the xps peaks of mn and as in go mno2 goe after the uptake of as iii and as v mn was seen to be present as mn ii mn iii and mn iv forms in the as iii sorbed go mno2 goe fig 16a whereas no mn ii was present in case of as v sorbed go mno2 goe fig 16c in case of arsenic for as iii uptake by go mno2 goe it was observed that as was present as both as iii and as v fig 16b but in case of as v uptake it was present as only as v fig 16d the above observations clearly suggest the oxidation of as iii to as v by the mno2 in go mno2 goe ca alg beads mno2 itself reduces to mno and mn2o3 while oxidising as iii the same was not applicable for as v uptake 3 8 sem eds mapping of the go mno2 goe ca alg beads after as iii as v uptake the sem eds mapping of go mno2 goe ca alg beads after arsenic uptake was carried out go mno2 goe ca alg beads saturated with as iii and as v were analysed separately in both the cases porous structure of the beads although not very the well defined structure were observed fig 17 a and b the elemental mapping of the beads suggests uniform distribution of the fe ca mn c and o throughout the analysis area fig 17a and b these are mainly the predominant elements of the constituents in the beads fe is because of goethite mn is because of mno2 ca is because of ca alginate hydrogel network c and o are the major light elements in go alginate and even goethite the similar distribution patterns are observed for both as iii and as v uptake as the base sorbent is the same the sorbed arsenic species was also seen to be uniformly present in both the cases fig 17a and b 3 9 probable mechanism of as iii and as v uptake by go mno2 goe ca alg beads arsenic is present in various forms based on the physicochemical condition of the groundwater system ph conductance etc concentration of each species at a given condition can be predicted from the fraction diagrams which are well documented in literature 71 72 as iii is mainly present as a neutral species in the groundwater ph h3aso3 is predominant in ph 1 9 fig 18 a but as v is present mostly as negative species in groundwater h2aso4 is predominant in ph 2 7 haso4 2 is predominant in ph 7 11 fig 18b the zeta potential of the active sorbent go mno2 goe was measured and plotted in fig 11 which suggest an iso electric point of the sorbent at ph 5 suggesting the negative surface charge of the sorbent above ph 5 mainly because of the deprotonation of the goethite the high uptake of both as iii and as v as shown in fig 11 can be explained by the favourable sorption of oppositely charged go mno2 goe surface and the as v species for both as iii and as v uptake the sorption is mainly due to the sorption of as v species rather than the neutral as iii species as iii is readily oxidised to as v by mno2 present in the sorbent which is proven from fig 10 uptake by different combinations of the constituents and from xps analysis fig 16 go has no direct role in the arsenic uptake rather more important in the formation of the core shell type of sorbents with high specific surface area calcium alginate plays the role of connector to form the hydrogel network the schematic of the probable mechanism is shown in fig 19 3 10 applicability of go mno2 goe ca alg beads for arsenic uptake in real water samples five groundwater samples were collected and the physicochemical parameters along with major ion concentrations were measured before and after spiking with as iii and as v separately no major alteration of the values was observed assuring drinkability of the groundwater results are provided in supplementary material table s1 the results confirm that the components of go mno2 goe ca alg beads were not leachable as mn fe ca concentrations and doc values were not enhanced due to the treatment 3 11 desorption of arsenic reusability study of the sorbent the beads having sufficient sorption capacity can be utilised multiple times for the arsenic for both as iii as v removal till they reach saturation desorption study was carried out on the saturated sorbents the different reagents phosphate and hydroxyl ions were used for desorption of as from both saturated go mno2 goe ca alg beads and saturated go mno2 goe powder it was observed that for the phosphate driven desorption carried out at ph 3 7 the desorption percentage was 46 77 for the go mno2 goe powder and 41 65 go mno2 goe ca alg beads in 2 h while using hydroxyl ions in ph 8 12 desorption was 38 51 for the go mno2 goe powder and 31 42 go mno2 goe ca alg beads in 1 h the desorption percentages were not very high may be due to inner sphere complexation of arenite and arsenate species with goethite a table containing the detailed desorption percentages is given in the supplementary material table s2 3 12 comparison of sorbents for as uptake table 3 presents a comparison of the different hybrid sorbents developed for arsenic removal the sorption capacities of the sorbents are also tabulated and compared with the present work it has to be noted that same sorbent being applicable for both as iii and as v removal is rare in literature 4 conclusion the study exhibits potential of go mno2 goe ca alg hydrogel beads for uptake of both arsenic iii and arsenic v from groundwater without disturbing water quality parameters optimum

13442,this study presents a simple method for facile synthesis of core shell microspheres of graphene oxide mno2 goethite go mno2 goe synthesised go was used as the core material for treatment with the pre decided molar ratio mixture of fe and mn to form a mno2 goe shell over the go surface optimising various parameters subsequently the go mno2 goe nanoparticles were impregnated into alginate

transformation of as iii to as v before its sorption was investigated and explained with the help of xps analysis keywords graphene oxide goethite mno2 hybrid material calcium alginate arsenic 1 introduction water pollution has become a serious issue worldwide one of the most common source of groundwater pollution is through arsenic contamination several areas in world have reported for high arsenic concentrations in groundwater 1 2 which include large and highly populated countries like china india usa canada mexico japan bangladesh etc 3 4 because of highly toxicity and carcinogenicity world health organization has set the prescribed limit for as in potable water as 10 Î¼g l 1 5 6 in natural groundwater arsenic is present in various forms like particulate matter soluble component organic bound material 7 in nature arsenic occurs in both trivalent as iii and pentavalent as v states driven by redox potential of the medium both the oxidation states are frequently observed because redox transformations of arsenic species are relatively slow ph and eh redox potential have great impact on arsenic speciation 8 9 arsenic speciation with predominant species at different ph h3aso3 h3aso4 h3aso3 2 h3aso4 2 h3aso4 aso4 3 etc has been extensively discussed in literature 10 11 new technologies and materials are constantly being evolved by researchers worldwide to tackle water pollution from contaminants of various kinds including trace and toxic elements organic dyes radioactive materials 12 13 earlier investigated technologies for arsenic removal from potable water include adsorption coagulation sedimentation ion exchange nano and ultra filtration reverse osmosis 10 14 15 materials such as activated charcoal alumina alum ferric hydroxide iron oxy hydroxides various biomasses have been reported for arsenic decontamination from ground water 16 17 but to bring down arsenic concentration below 10 Î¼g l 1 many of these reported materials displayed low capacity some materials work at extreme ph condition some are prone to release their chemical constituents in water leading to further pollution of water a major constrain is that most of the reported materials and technologies available are for only as v removal form groundwater 18 21 as iii because of its neutral nature at ambient ph is not removed by these sorbents few methods suggest as iii oxidation in a separate pre treatment method to as v which increase the naoh koh and hno3 hcl load on the water processes involving ion exchange reverse osmosis nano ultrafiltration are not cost effective as they need regular maintenance and change of costly consumable components iron oxide hydroxide oxy hydroxide based sorbents are very efficient in the removal of arsenic and many other heavy elements arsenic can be coprecipitated along iron oxides and hydroxides from groundwater 22 24 utilising nanocrystals of iron oxides e g magnetite hematite goethite etc or in form of nano composites not only increase its removal efficiency but also reduce the waste generation because of high specific surface area 4 25 goethite feooh which is iron iii oxy hydroxide is susceptible to redox reaction and hydroxides formation being triggered by ph change or atmospheric exposure to overcome this issue researchers have attached these iron oxide nanoparticles with polymeric matrix carbon based materials like activated carbon graphene oxide go cnt 26 29 graphene oxide go is potentially a good supporting material for iron oxides or oxy hydroxides because of monolayer sheet like structure of sp2 hybridised carbon in hexagonal array with intermittently attached functional groups on surfaces properties like high thermal electrical conductivity very high surface area etc attracted researchers to explore its potential as a sorbing media or as a constituent of hybrid material along with its other application in electronics sensing catalysis etc 30 33 in recent years a number of studies have been carried out on utilisation of graphene or modified graphene composites for removal of verities of pollutants from water 34 40 to address the issue of difficulties in removal of as iii the use of binary oxide or oxide oxy hydroxide comprising manganese oxide mno2 and goethite iron oxy hydroxide have been proposed here mno2 acts as an oxidant and goethite functions as a sorbent for arsenic mno2 has been studied for oxidation of as iii to as v while mno2 itself being reduced to mn iii or mn ii but it is not a good absorber for arsenic 21 41 43 mn fe binary mixture in mno2 goethite form can be proved to be an efficient sorbent for both as iii and as v for as v goethite can directly function for sorption whereas for as iii mno2 fraction can promote its oxidation followed by sorption by goethite fusing this binary mixture mno2 goethite with go provide important advantages properties of go can be utilised by judiciously placing the mno2 goethite in the nano composite structure 20 21 44 45 it can be formed as a core shell composite with high surface area adjustable pore structure and narrow distribution of sizes 46 49 suitable properties of mno2 goethite and go have motivated us to make a core shell hybrid microspheres involving them for the as iii and as v removal application these core shell nanosorbents are however difficult to be separated from water and to be employed in column method due to extremely small particle size if the core shell nano composite can be tailored to a different matrix without any compromise on its effectiveness it can be easier for practical application alginate being a polysaccharide is a good candidate in this regard 50 52 many earlier studies including ours have used alginate for immobilisation of suitable nanosorbent because of the ability of alginate to form stable gel at room formation through crosslinking the guluronate moieties of alginate chain with the divalent cations ca ba sr etc 53 55 in this study we report facile synthesis of core shell microspheres of go mno2 goethite go mno2 goe and subsequent impregnation into alginate to form go mno2 goethite impregnated alginate hydrogel beads go mno2 goe ca alg optimising various parameters developed hybrid hydrogel beads were characterised using various techniques ftir sem eds xrd bet the go mno2 goe ca alg beads were utilised for removal of both as ii and as v from groundwater 0 1 100 Î¼gml 1 ph 4 6 without affecting the water quality index impact of various parameters on as uptake were studied and sorption capacity was evaluated the sorption data was fitted into suitable isotherm kinetic and inter particle diffusion models the mechanism was suggested by understanding the interaction of as iii and as v species with go and mno2 goethite layers in the core shell nanocomposites 2 experimental 2 1 reagents all reagents used were analytical grade sigma aldrich demineralised water with resistivity 0 01 Î¼s cm 1 and doc 5 ng ml 1 was used for preparation of solutions experimental as iii solution was prepared by dissolving naaso2 and as v solution was prepared by dissolving na2haso4 7h2o in nitric acid arsenic as standard stock solutions in hno3 sigma aldrich was used for preparation calibration standards ph modification of the experimental simulated solutions was carried out using hno3 and naoh 2 2 synthesis the synthesis of the hydrogel go mno2 goethite core shell microsphere loaded alginate hydrogel was carried out as follows 2 2 1 synthesis of graphene oxide go graphene oxide go was synthesized following modified hummers method 28 56 57 this method is most widely accepted fast and efficient for pure go synthesis graphite powder is treated with h2so4 and kmno4 to exfoliate the graphite layer structure followed by reduction of excess kmno4 using h2o2 the formed go was separated using pressurised ultrafiltration system millipore 2 l high pressure cell with 10000d nmwl membrane and subsequently washed the details of the synthesis procedure are discussed in the electronic supplementary material 2 2 2 synthesis of go mno2 goethite microsphere go mno2 geo the dried go powder was used as the core material for the synthesis of graphene oxide mno2 goethite go mno2 geo core shell particles 1 0 g go particle was suspended in 25 ml water using ultrasonication retsch ur1 and heated at 60 c under magnetic stirring at 600 rpm the ph was adjusted in acidic range ph 3 4 a pre decided molar ratio mixture of fe as fecl2 and mn as kmno4 solution was added slowly to the go suspension at 60 c and under continuous stirring 400 rpm fe mn molar ratio was varied from 0 to 8 the reaction was allowed to continue at 60 c for 1 h then allowed to cool at room temperature go mno2 geo core shell particles were formed 21 46 48 particles were separated using ultrafiltration system 10000d nmwl membrane and washed thoroughly with water before drying them in an oven at 60 70 c for 24 h on 01e jeio tech oven 2 2 3 synthesis of go mno2 goethite microsphere impregnated alginate go mno2 goe ca alg beads prepared go mno2 geo was loaded into alginate matrix to form mno2 goethite microsphere impregnated alginate go mno2 goe ca alg hydrogel beads synthesized go mno2 geo powder was mixed at varied proportion to 3 na alginate solution the mixture was thoroughly homogenised stirring at 1200 rpm 3 h and was dropped with the help of a peristaltic pump into 4 w v calcium chloride through displacement reaction of na alginate with calcium chloride hydrogel beads of go mno2

quantification of arsenic inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp oes from thermo scientific model icap 6000 was used for determination of arsenic concentration in Î¼gml 1 range

spectrometer icp ms model vg pq excell vg elemental uk was used 2 5 sample preparation and physicochemical parameters measurement simulated arsenic iii and v solution were prepared spiking already prepared as iii and as v stock solutions into demineralised water for specific requirements groundwater samples were however used locally collected groundwater samples from mumbai india containing no arsenic 1 ng ml 1 was used and spiked with arsenic as per requirement all the groundwater samples collected were filtered through 0 45 Î¼m paper prior to their use in the laboratory various physicochemical parameters like ph conductivity redox behaviour were monitored using pico lab india ph and conductivity meter major anion and cation were analysed by ion chromatography whereas trace and heavy metals were analysed by icp oes 2 6 uptake experiment arsenic sorption studies on go mno2 goe ca alg beads was carried out in batch experiment method predecided amount of arsenic was added into pre cleaned dry borosilicate glass bottles ph adjusted measured quantity of go mno2 goe ca alg beads were added to it sets were kept on an orbital shaker spinix tarson with pulse shaking mode on till equilibrium is established between the sorbent and arsenic after separation of go mno2 goe ca alg beads arsenic concentration was measured and uptake quantity was calculated detailed equation is given in supplementary information for the effect of contact time fixed go mno2 goe ca alg beads amount and arsenic concentration were maintained and contact time was varied gradually 2 7 kinetics isotherm and thermodynamics study optimum amount of go mno2 goe ca alg beads was allowed to be in contact to known arsenic concentration for a pre determined varying time interval for the kinetics study for isotherm evaluation different arsenic concentrations were kept in contact with go mno2 goe ca alg beads till equilibrium is established final arsenic concentrations were measured kinetics experiment was carried out at three different ambient temperatures 277 0 5 k 298 0 5 k and 328 0 5 k temperatures were maintained separately for the batches 3 results and discussion 3 1 synthesis and characterization go mno2 goe was characterised before its impregnating into alginate matrix developed go mno2 goe ca alg hydrogel beads was also characterised 3 1 1 go first the synthesised go through chemical exfoliation of graphite modified hummers method was characterised by recording its xrd and ftir in the xrd pattern of go 001 crystal plane was evident fig 1 the spacing evaluated was 8 31 Ã¥ which is typical value for go 30 ftir spectrum in fig 2 shows the signature of go vibrational peaks at 1084 cm 1 and 1387 cm 1 were observed due to co and characteristic vibration of cc oh were observed at 1627 cm 1 and 3434 cm 1 respectively 58 59 3 1 2 go mno2 goe in the next step core shell particles of go mno2 goe were formed schematic of which is shown in fig 3 go was used as a support for immobilizing the production of reaction between kmno4 and fecl2 to prevent iron hydroxide precipitation and oxidation the ph of go suspension was pre adjusted to ph 3 4 mno4 and fe ii molar ratio played an important role for the formation of iron oxy hydroxide goethite feooh kmno4 concentration was fixed at 0 1 m for 1 g of go fe ii concentration was varied varying the fe mn molar ratio from 0 to 8 it was observed that when the molar ratio was 3 the mno2 goe binary oxide oxy hydroxide was formed in the first step of reduction of mno4 by fe2 mno2 goe is perfectly formed equ 1 1 go 3 fec l 2

desired product equ 2 at molar ratio 3 mno2 and goethite co precipitated on go surface to form the binary oxide oxy hydroxide immobilised go microspheres the xrd of the go mno2 goe confirms the formation of the same with the phases of go Î± mno2 and Î± goethite being clearly identified fig 4 atr ftir of the formed product vibration showed peaks at 538 cm 1 which is characteristic mn o stretching vibration in mno2 51 60 62 peaks at 799 cm 1 and 900 cm 1 are due to the hydroxyl deformation fe oh of goethite 4 51 63 64 and a single peak at 1084 cm 1 is due to co vibration in go 58 59 fig 5 the size of the go mno2 goe particles was in the range of 60 310 nm with a mean diameter of 104 nm as seen in the size number distribution provided in fig 6 derived from dls measurement this size is higher compared to the size of the go particle 50 210 nm fig 6 which is because of the growth of mno2 goe binary oxide oxy hydroxide over the go sheet bet analysis showed a surface area of this microspheres as 372 6 m2 g 1 bet plot is provided in the supplementary material fig s1 3 1 3 go mno2 goe ca alg hydrogel beads go mno2 goe particles were immobilised in calcium alginate polymeric matrix during calcium alginate formation from sodium alginate solution through displacement reaction go mno2 goe particles were impregnated uniformly in the hydrogel beads size of the formed go mno2 goe ca alg hydrogel beads was 1 9 0 1 mm digital image of the beads is presented in fig 7 uniform size and spherical shape of go mno2 goe ca alg beads was maintained by precisely controlling the addition rate of go mno2 goe and sodium alginate homogenised mixture through a 1 5 mm diameter tube to calcium chloride solution bet surface area analysis of go mno2 goe ca alg beads yielded 169 3 m2 g 1 specific surface area which is significantly less than the go mno2 goe microspheres bet plot is provided in supplementary material fig s2 recorded sem images of go mno2 goe ca alg beads fig 8 showed porous surface structure with surface deposition of mno2 crystals which is clearly visible in the magnified image fig 8 composition of the go mno2 goe ca alg beads was optimised it was found that optimised loading of go mno2 goe was 21 in 3 calcium alginate hydrogels for further verification of the composition of hydrogel beads water content was analysis gave a value of 75 77 which is the reason behind high permeability of the beads chemical analysis of the dried residue of the beads suggested presence of ca mn fe analysed through icp oes and low z elements like c o n h using elemental analyzer euroea optimisation details and the stability check of go mno2 goe ca alg beads have been presented in the supplementary material 3 2 uptake of as iii and as v by go mno2 goe ca alg beads prepared and characterised go mno2 goe ca alg beads were utilised for the uptake of as iii and as v effects of various parameters like initial concentration ph contact time temperature are disused here 3 2 1 effect of initial concentration of as iii and as v sorption of as both as iii and as v by go mno2 goe ca alg beads was studied for initial concentration range of 0 1 100 Î¼g ml 1 keeping the bead dose constant at 5 mg ml 1 results of uptake are given in fig 9 it shows more than 90 uptake of as v for initial concentration range of 0 1 10 Î¼g ml 1 thereafter it slightly reduces due to gradual occupancy of limited number of sites available in the beads with increase in input arsenic concentrations fig 9 also shows the uptake of as iii at different concentrations it was observed that the uptake of as iii was 85 95 for 0 1 10 Î¼g ml 1 and thereafter it reduces the slightly lesser uptake of as iii was observed compared to as v irrespective of initial concentration this is because of the involvement of mno2 reduction mechanism in case of as iii prior to interaction with goethite in case of as v its direct interaction of as v with goethite the standard deviation of the percentage uptake depicted as error bars in fig 9 and other subsequent figs were derived from five identical samples analysis 3 2 2 comparison of individual components a comparison on percentage uptake of as iii and as v by different combinations of the components of the go mno2 goe ca alg beads are plotted in fig 10 initial concentration 10 Î¼g ml 1 contact time 24 h dose rate 5 mg ml 1 ph 6 7 for pure ca alg and go ca alg beads uptake for both as iii and as v were as low as 20 and 25 respectively for go mno2 ca alg beads uptake was 30 for both as iii and as v suggesting minimal role of mno2 for uptake in case of go goe ca alg beads uptake is substantially high for as v but low for as iii confirming the role of mno2 for the oxidation of as iii and goethite for uptake of as v for go mno2 goe ca alg beads and go mno2 goe powder uptake was very high as also observed for the beads in fig 9 and go mno2 goe powder can alone be used for both as iii and as v uptake but hydrogel beads are preferred over powder due to easy isolation and low leachability 3 2 3 effect of ph on uptake fig 11 shows the percentage uptake of both as iii and as v with respect to ph of the medium medium ph was artificially maintained at different values from ph 1 to ph 10 keeping other parameters constant initial concentration 10 Î¼g ml 1 contact time 24 h 1 mg ml 1 results showed that uptake was maximum in ph range 4 6 for as v and as iii also followed almost the similar trend the fig 11 also provides the zeta potential of go and go mno2 goe zeta potential values of sorbent at different ph and the as iii and as v speciation diagrams help to understand the mechanism which are discussed in details in latter parts the reason behind similar trend of as iii and as v is basically conversion of as iii to as v by mno2 prior to its sorption by goethite 3 2 4 effect of time and temperature on uptake equilibrium time for as iii and as v uptake go mno2 goe ca alg beads was optimised keeping initial concentration 10 Î¼g ml 1 contact time 24 h dose rate 1 mg ml 1 and ph 5 the batches were thermally equilibrated at three different temperatures 277 k 298 k and 325 k fig 12 shows that percentage uptake of both as iii and as v increases with increase in equilibration time till 5 h before it saturates although the trend is similar for all three thermal conditions but the uptake percentages differ which is used to evaluate thermodynamic parameters experimental equilibrium time was fixed at 5 h for sufficient uptake of as iii and as v to take place slow diffusion of arsenic species into polymeric hydrogel matrix to interact with go mno2 goe is responsible for moderate equilibrium time 3 3 isotherm study sorption data of both as iii and as v at stp 298 k 1 atm were used to fit them into a suitable isotherm model two extensively used isotherm models for understanding the interaction of solute and sorbent namely langmuir and freundlich models 48 65 66 were tested details of these models to illustrate the sorption are discussed in literature including our earlier works 48 65 67 if qe is equilibrium arsenic concentration in sorbent and ce is equilibrium arsenic concentration in solution the langmuir equ 3 and freundlich equ 4 isotherm model are as follows 3 q e q 0 b c e 1 b c e 4 q e k c e 1 n these two isotherms of arsenic sorption on go mno2 goe ca alg beads are plotted in fig 13 a and b for as iii and as v respectively both the sorption were seen to follow the langmuir model with adjusted r2 values of 0 92 and 0 95 respectively sorption capacity q0 of go mno2 goe ca alg beads for as iii and as v were evaluated from langmuir model the values were 28 53 mgg 1 and 34 17 mgg 1 respectively for as iii and as v the parameters evaluated from the isotherm models are presented in table 1 3 4 kinetics study two basic kinetic models pseudo first and pseudo second order were tested the sorption data of as iii and as v at room temperature as plotted in fig 12a and b were used for the fitting points beyond saturation were not considered to get a true nature of the fitting the kinetic analysis shows that the sorption of both as iii and as v on go mno2 goe ca alg beads followed pseudo first order model with the adjusted r2 values of 0 9807 and 0 9812 respectively fig 14 a and b for pseudo second order model adjusted r2 values were not satisfactory 0 8676 and 0 8934 for as iii and as v respectively pseudo second order kinetic plot is provided in supplementary information fig s3a and s3b the kinetic equations along with the evaluated parameters like rate constants are provided in table 2 3 5 thermodynamics study sorption is normally dependent on the temperature it is clear from fig 12a and b that sorption percentages for both as iii and as v by go mno2 goe ca alg beads increases with increase in the experimental temperature three different isothermal conditions at 4 k 298 k and 333 k were maintained the results indicate that both as iii and as v uptake by go mno2 goe ca alg beads were endothermic in nature which may be attributed to the enhancement in the rate of interparticle diffusion of arsenic species into the beads gibb s free energy Î´g0 can be calculated from the kinetic data to get an idea about spontaneity of as iii and as v uptake by the go mno2 goe ca alg beads the following equation equ 5 is used 56 5 Î´g0 rt ln k the equilibrium constant at 298 k k is calculated for as iii and as v sorption by go mno2 goe ca alg beads k evaluated and r universal gas constant value of 8 314 j mol 1 k 1 are used to calculate Î´g0 Î´g0 values were evaluated as 20 54 kj mol 1 for as iii sorption and 22 32 kj mol 1 for as v sorption suggesting both the sorption reactions were spontaneous 3 6 diffusion modelling the process of uptake of arsenic in go mno2 goe ca alg hydrogel beads may occur in single step or may involve multiple steps to understand it better intraparticle diffusion model weber morris equation equ 6 was utilised where ki is rate constant for diffusion mg g 1 h1 2 and c mg g 1 is constant but dependent on boundary layer thickness 68 70 6 q t k i t 1 2 c positive slope suggests favourable adsorption as plotted in fig 15 both the as iii and as v uptake on go mno2 goe ca alg beads occur in three steps first two parts having positive slopes probably due to the interaction of the arsenic species with the outer alginate polymer and due to interaction with the active ingredients mno2 goethite composite third part of the plot fig 15 is having zero slope suggesting saturation of as iii and as v uptake 3 7 xps analysis to understand the uptake mechanism of both as iii and as v uptake by the go mno2 goe ca alg beads the samples were subjected to xps analysis go mno2 goe saturated with as iii and as v separately were analysed fig 16 shows the xps peaks of mn and as in go mno2 goe after the uptake of as iii and as v mn was seen to be present as mn ii mn iii and mn iv forms in the as iii sorbed go mno2 goe fig 16a whereas no mn ii was present in case of as v sorbed go mno2 goe fig 16c in case of arsenic for as iii uptake by go mno2 goe it was observed that as was present as both as iii and as v fig 16b but in case of as v uptake it was present as only as v fig 16d the above observations clearly suggest the oxidation of as iii to as v by the mno2 in go mno2 goe ca alg beads mno2 itself reduces to mno and mn2o3 while oxidising as iii the same was not applicable for as v uptake 3 8 sem eds mapping of the go mno2 goe ca alg beads after as iii as v uptake the sem eds mapping of go mno2 goe ca alg beads after arsenic uptake was carried out go mno2 goe ca alg beads saturated with as iii and as v were analysed separately in both the cases porous structure of the beads although not very the well defined structure were observed fig 17 a and b the elemental mapping of the beads suggests uniform distribution of the fe ca mn c and o throughout the analysis area fig 17a and b these are mainly the predominant elements of the constituents in the beads fe is because of goethite mn is because of mno2 ca is because of ca alginate hydrogel network c and o are the major light elements in go alginate and even goethite the similar distribution patterns are observed for both as iii and as v uptake as the base sorbent is the same the sorbed arsenic species was also seen to be uniformly present in both the cases fig 17a and b 3 9 probable mechanism of as iii and as v uptake by go mno2 goe ca alg beads arsenic is present in various forms based on the physicochemical condition of the groundwater system ph conductance etc concentration of each species at a given condition can be predicted from the fraction diagrams which are well documented in literature 71 72 as iii is mainly present as a neutral species in the groundwater ph h3aso3 is predominant in ph 1 9 fig 18 a but as v is present mostly as negative species in groundwater h2aso4 is predominant in ph 2 7 haso4 2 is predominant in ph 7 11 fig 18b the zeta potential of the active sorbent go mno2 goe was measured and plotted in fig 11 which suggest an iso electric point of the sorbent at ph 5 suggesting the negative surface charge of the sorbent above ph 5 mainly because of the deprotonation of the goethite the high uptake of both as iii and as v as shown in fig 11 can be explained by the favourable sorption of oppositely charged go mno2 goe surface and the as v species for both as iii and as v uptake the sorption is mainly due to the sorption of as v species rather than the neutral as iii species as iii is readily oxidised to as v by mno2 present in the sorbent which is proven from fig 10 uptake by different combinations of the constituents and from xps analysis fig 16 go has no direct role in the arsenic uptake rather more important in the formation of the core shell type of sorbents with high specific surface area calcium alginate plays the role of connector to form the hydrogel network the schematic of the probable mechanism is shown in fig 19 3 10 applicability of go mno2 goe ca alg beads for arsenic uptake in real water samples five groundwater samples were collected and the physicochemical parameters along with major ion concentrations were measured before and after spiking with as iii and as v separately no major alteration of the values was observed assuring drinkability of the groundwater results are provided in supplementary material table s1 the results confirm that the components of go mno2 goe ca alg beads were not leachable as mn fe ca concentrations and doc values were not enhanced due to the treatment 3 11 desorption of arsenic reusability study of the sorbent the beads having sufficient sorption capacity can be utilised multiple times for the arsenic for both as iii as v removal till they reach saturation desorption study was carried out on the saturated sorbents the different reagents phosphate and hydroxyl ions were used for desorption of as from both saturated go mno2 goe ca alg beads and saturated go mno2 goe powder it was observed that for the phosphate driven desorption carried out at ph 3 7 the desorption percentage was 46 77 for the go mno2 goe powder and 41 65 go mno2 goe ca alg beads in 2 h while using hydroxyl ions in ph 8 12 desorption was 38 51 for the go mno2 goe powder and 31 42 go mno2 goe ca alg beads in 1 h the desorption percentages were not very high may be due to inner sphere complexation of arenite and arsenate species with goethite a table containing the detailed desorption percentages is given in the supplementary material table s2 3 12 comparison of sorbents for as uptake table 3 presents a comparison of the different hybrid sorbents developed for arsenic removal the sorption capacities of the sorbents are also tabulated and compared with the present work it has to be noted that same sorbent being applicable for both as iii and as v removal is rare in literature 4 conclusion the study exhibits potential of go mno2 goe ca alg hydrogel beads for uptake of both arsenic iii and arsenic v from groundwater without disturbing water quality parameters optimum composition of the hydrogel beads was 21 go mno2 goe microspheres loaded in 3 calcium alginate uptake processes for both as iii and as v followed langmuir isotherm model with maximum sorption capacity evaluated as 27 53 mg g 1 and 34 17 mg g 1 at stp respectively for as iii and as v sem eds and xps analysis were used to understand the interaction between as iii and as v and the go mno2 goe ca alg

13443,this paper summarized the metabolic pathways mechanisms and performance of various microbial induced calcite precipitation micp microorganisms as self healing agents for the development of self healing bioconcrete despite the remarkable progress achieved to date the high costs involved in the cultivation and encapsulation of the axenic cultures have led to a shift of research focus towards the use of non axenic microbial cultures they have superior benefits as self healing agents in terms of easy cultivation and low cost granular sludge was widely used in wastewater treatment considering the high need for concrete based wastewater infrastructure granular sludge cultivated using wastewater has the potential to develop bioconcrete for sewer systems and wastewater treatment plants to achieve large scale application future research should enhance the understanding of the long term performances and develop systematic and comparable evaluation methods keywords self healing bioconcrete axenic cultures non axenic cultures 1 introduction concrete is the most consumed material in the world by mass besides water 1 by its high compressive strength compatibility with reinforcement bars low cost availability and ease of casting in desired shapes and sizes concrete became the backbone for large scale constructions and infrastructures 2 yearly the consumption of concrete is approaching 30 billion tonnes and over past 65 years relative to the per capita production of other materials such as steel and wood there is a 10 fold increase in the concrete production 3 of all the concrete constructions sewer networks are of the most critical components that are required to prevent the exposure of humans to the unhygienic sewage nowadays the scale of these systems built is massive and if only china japan us uk and germany are considered the total length of sewer networks far exceeds the circumference of earth by more than 10 times 4 the total length of australia s sewer pipes is over 110 000 km and the overall estimated sewer asset value is reported to be 100 billion dollars 5 7 thus the durability of concrete is an important aspect to be considered in designing these structures concrete often suffers severe degradation and deterioration because of physical chemical and biological attacks these threatening factors along with the concrete s low tensile strength increase the tendency of cracking to address the tensile strength issues steel reinforcement bars are used and their good condition plays a vital role in the durability of the concrete structures the alkaline concrete environment provides a passivation effect on the rebar 8 however the increased permeability of concrete because of cracking exposes the steel reinforcement to the ambient conditions this exposure leads to the carbonation decrease in ph and eventually the hindrance of the passivation of rebar in the early ages although cracks do not pose a serious risk to the concrete strength their formation in the long run can lead to the reduction in the lifespan 9 13 not only cracking but sewer systems also face severe structural deterioration because of corrosion induced by microbes this corrosion termed as microbial induced concrete corrosion micc is one of the main factors for reducing the lifespan of the structures 14 15 for instance the service life of sewers was reduced from expected 100 years to 30 50 years and in extreme cases even below 10 years or lesser 14 16 the yearly rehabilitation costs for these sewer systems are estimated to be around 982 million in australia and more than 85 million in uk and 450 in germany while the usa need to spend around 390 billion in the coming 20 years 17 20 it also raises health and environmental concerns apart from high financial costs 14 21 24 various maintenance and repair methods passive treatment such as epoxy resin reinforcing grouting gravity filling using cementitious materials or epoxy injections were performed traditionally 13 25 to repair and maintain the cracks with a width of 400 Î¼m it costs approximately 250 m2 whereas the estimated cost of new concrete production is 44 m2 26 this raising cost of the sealing process made the researchers to look for another way of introducing applied biotechnology that heals the concrete their efforts led to the development of new domain called microbial concrete or self healing bioconcrete 27 29 in this strategy the concrete structures are treated with bacteria to induce calcium carbonate through a process called microbial induced calcite calcium carbonate precipitation micp which leads to the sealing of cracks by calcite 30 fig 1 apart from cracking and corrosion concrete s high co2 footprint is also a major drawback 31 an essential component of concrete is cement and its production faces challenges like depleting raw materials and fuel reserves and increasing environmental concerns if cement production is compared to a country it would be the third largest co2 emitter in the world accounting up to 2 8 billion tonnes exceeded only by china and the us 1 to address the environmental sustainability of concrete the microbial self healing concrete made by incorporating mineral producing bacteria can be a promising solution 32 33 there has been a significant volume of research done on various aspects of microbial concrete after the pioneering works of ramachandran et al 2001 34 fig 2 shows the exponentially growing research publications in this field there are some excellent review articles on self healing concrete based on three key taxonomies such as natural self healing chemical self healing and biological self healing 29 30 35 40 more recently effectiveness of self healing in actual structures and its potential to achieve sustainable concrete were explored 41 42 it is evident from the studies that the presence of bacteria in any form in concrete increases the strength in comparison to the traditional concrete 27 43 46 moreover the involvement of bacterial cultures prevents rebar from its corrosion by forming a passive layer 47 it was also proved that bioconcrete imparts protection by decreasing freeze thaw cracks 48 coming to the durability the research on bacteria based bioconcrete proved that it is denser and more durable than the traditional concrete 49 it may extend the existence of current constructions thus becoming a renewal alternative 48 when compared to traditional concrete though there are some initial cost issues involved in the bioconcrete development in the long run the self healing capabilities of bioconcrete will reduce the long term maintenance of structures 49 50 several authors have dealt with different microbial pathways such as urea hydrolysis denitrification methane oxidation and sulfate reduction since 2001 and they have achieved crack closure to a great extent 27 44 46 51 58 to the best of our knowledge most of the research work was done using single bacterial cultures that incurred hefty costs for their production and protection from the harsh concrete environments mostly ureolytic bacteria were used and they had survivability issues in the concrete s environment 59 60 only a few studies addressed these issues and considered self protected alternative microbial communities for calcium carbonate precipitation 61 moreover there are some questions regarding the functionality of the bacteria under realistic environmental conditions the previous research mostly carried out the testing of self healing and concrete properties shortly after casting and curing of concrete samples sometimes up to 6 months 45 47 57 61 62 as cracking can happen at any stage of the service life of the concrete structures there is a need for the durability study over years rather than just for weeks or months moreover there is a lack of data on the service life of the bioconcrete structures in comparison to general concrete ones a comprehensive review addressing all the aforementioned issues has not been found to gain a better overview this review aims to compile the drawbacks of the currently investigated micp pathways and it consolidates the reasons that led the researchers shift their focus towards the use of non axenic cultures as economically feasible healing agents in inducing calcium carbonate precipitation for persistent sealing of the cracks self healing bioconcrete could find large applications in wastewater infrastructure i e sewers wastewater treatment plants and other concrete structures due to the continuous investment harsh wastewater environment and high maintenance costs this review focuses on identifying bioconcrete as a preferential choice for the next generation wastewater infrastructure 2 the pioneering concept of microbial induced caco3 precipitation the contemporary times witnessed a ground breaking development of self healing concrete through the incorporation of bacterial cells to induce carbonate precipitation which in turn seals the crack this green approach was termed as microbial induced calcite precipitation micp by stocks fischer et al 1999 and the concrete which has been developed using this approach is called as self healing concrete or microbial concrete or bioconcrete 28 29 63 64 micp was first reported in the late 20th century in occurrence with urea decomposition by the marine microbiota 65 66 in biologically controlled mineralization process the microbe controls the nucleation and growth of the mineral particles to a large extent however micp is generally regarded as induced because the environmental conditions play a vital role in deciding the type of mineral produced without the involvement of specialized structures or molecular mechanisms 66 67 hammes and verstraete reported that the calcium concentration the concentration of dissolved inorganic carbon the ph and the availability of the nucleation sites are the four key factors that influence the caco3 precipitation 68 chemical precipitation of a compound occurs in aqueous solution when the solution is completely saturated with their ions the solubility product constant ksp of caco3 is 4 8 10 9 at 25 c 38 thus by increasing the concentration of co3 2 ions caco3 precipitation can occur in the presence of ca2 the precipitation reaction follows second order kinetics or pseudo first order kinetics if at all any of the reagent is present in excess 69 bacteria can regulate the formation of calcite crystal polymorphs and thus influences the saturation and rate of carbonate precipitation when the ksp is exceeded by the concentration of ca2 and co3 2 ions then the solution reaches supersaturation 70 eq 1 the higher the supersaturation the more will be the precipitation of calcite 1 s c a 2 c o 3 2 k s p microorganisms influence the precipitation process by altering almost any of the above mentioned factors either individually or in combination with others their key role has been attributed to their ability to increase the alkalinity of the environment by producing co3 2 ions through their metabolic pathways apart from the changes induced in the microenvironment bacteria also influence the caco3 precipitation by acting as nucleation sites at neutral ph the positively charged metal ions e g ca2 bind to the negatively charged groups on the microbial cell wall and subsequently react with anions e g carbonate to form an insoluble salt e g caco3 the mineral formation occurs when the required cation and anions are present in excess of saturation 32 furthermore it was demonstrated that the exopolysaccharides and amino acids present in the specific bacterial outer structures like glycol calyx and parietal polymers play a vital role in the morphology and mineralogy of micp 71 72 2 1 autotrophic and heterotrophic mediated calcite precipitation pathways following the above mentioned conditions bacteria precipitate caco3 through autotrophic and heterotrophic pathways table 1 and extensive research on these physiological processes were conducted by several researchers 73 78 in the autotrophic mediated pathway the microbes induce the caco3 precipitation in the presence of ca2 ions via conversion of carbon dioxide in its immediate environment this pathway includes anaerobic oxidation of methane anoxygenic and oxygenic photosynthesis 73 86 87 carbon dioxide is the carbon source for all the autotrophic pathways anaerobic oxidation of methane results in the production of bicarbonate by the electron acceptors such as sulfate in the presence of calcium the produced carbonate precipitates as caco3 whereas in photosynthesis process two groups namely oxygenic and anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria produce caco3 in the presence of calcium ions by utilizing water and hydrogen sulfide as electron donors respectively to produce methanal the removal of carbon dioxide from the bicarbonate solutions results in the carbonate production which leads to increase in localized ph and caco3 precipitation in the presence of calcium ions 68 88 despite the possibility of caco3 precipitation the fact that the autotrophic pathways require carbon dioxide as carbon source and light in case of photosynthesis poses several negative impacts for bioconcrete production bioconcrete based on this pathway can only be applied in those areas of concrete structures that are exposed to carbon dioxide and or light nitrogen cycle and sulfur cycle are the two heterotrophic mediated pathways through which caco3 precipitation occurs 33 the nitrogen cycle is further categorised into ammonification of amino acids dissimilatory nitrate reduction and urea degradation 87 carbonate bicarbonate ions or ammonia is produced as a metabolic end product in all these mechanisms ammonia production increases the alkalinity of the microenvironment and shifts the carbonate bicarbonate equilibria towards the precipitation of caco3 sulfate reducing bacteria srb carry out the sulfur cycle via dissimilatory sulfate reduction in an anoxic calcium and sulfate rich environment srb degrade the organic matter and produce bicarbonate ions and hydrogen sulfide h2s using so4 2 as terminal electron acceptor 89 in the presence of ca2 ions the degasification of h2s occurs and this increases the ph of the surrounding environment which eventually induces the caco3 precipitation some important research on the self healing performance of different types of bioconcrete are summarized in the table 2 2 2 drawbacks of the currently investigated micp pathways because of their pioneering works in the ornamental stone surfaces restoration adolphe et al 1990 obtained the patent for the micp technique termed bio concept of calcite or bio deposition which has expired in 2010 95 each of the pathways that has been incorporated for the studies witnessed some major drawbacks the microbial urea hydrolysis releases ammonia which is known for aquatic toxicity 96 both urea hydrolysis and the aerobic oxidation of methane pathways require o2 as the final electron acceptor yet in the concrete applications this is limited particularly in the deeper parts of the cracks not only this the solubility of o2 in water 9 1 mg l at 20 c is 102 to 105 times lower than the other types of electron acceptors such as no3 or so4 2 besides the caco3 precipitation itself entraps the bacterial cells and inhibit the o2 diffusion 97 unlike urea hydrolysis the aerobic respiration does not produce alkalinity which is the major inducing factor for calcite precipitation 98 though concrete has an alkaline environment in the long run this process might encounter alkalinity limitation issues when necessary nutrients are considered the urea hydrolysis requires yeast extract and urea and on the other side aerobic respiration requires either calcium lactate or calcium glutamate along with yeast extract which are incompatible with the cement matrix 99 102 therefore their incorporation should be limited to a certain extent there is a need to select beneficial micp pathways that work well with the concrete environment current research mainly studied self healing performance up to a few months nosouhian et al 2016 tested the increase of compressive strength of concrete to 20 with s pasteurii along with b subtilis after 28 days 62 xu and wang tested the crack healing of width 417 Î¼m following 28 days of incubation and ersan achieved a 465 Î¼m crack width healing after 56 days 45 57 in another study the effect of curing time on self healing efficiency was evaluated after 4 and 6 months of curing 47 61 no studies tested the long term durability for several years which are pertinent for practical self healing thus long term durability studies are needed since cracking can occur at any point during the service life of concrete structures 2 3 drawbacks of axenic cultures as self healing agents to date appreciable self healing concrete has been achieved by various researchers using axenic cultures 2 25 52 92 103 107 concrete poses a major hurdle to the survivability of the microbial life due to factors like the high alkaline condition ph 13 the absence of o2 pore size less than 0 1 nm and elevated temperatures during the curing in addition the shear stress forces because of concrete mixing during the preparation stage can kill many microorganisms 108 effective self healing is said to be done only when the sealing is persistent over the long term and performs throughout the life of the structures therefore to substantially increase the survivability of bacteria by protecting them from the harsh concrete environment several techniques like encapsulation immobilization are employed 25 52 106 109 encapsulation protects the bacteria from the mechanical forces during concrete preparation process and thereby increase the viability of bacteria for a long period of time 38 on the other hand immobilization using swollen hydrogels provides extra water supply and enhances the efficiency of calcite precipitation to fill the cracks of width up to 0 5 mm 38 silica can retain the enzyme activity if it is used as the immobilizing agent 110 along with these protective strategies bacterial spores were also used as bio agents due to their remarkable resistance to harsh conditions 111 because of the considerable ureolytic activity potential to induce calcite precipitation and ability to sporulate it was hypothesized that the incorporation of b sphaericus spores together with urea into the concrete would provide self healing properties 104 112 113 another sporulating bacteria b cohnii was also considered as a potential self healing agent for bioconcrete based on the assumption of calcite precipitation 105 it is reported that b sphaericus spores can heal the concrete cracks up to 1 mm when microencapsulated 92 encapsulated b cohnii spores in expanded clay perlite can heal up to 0 2 mm 103 research was also done to optimize the spore formations and thereby increasing the rate of sporulation is considered necessary to meet the requirements of industrial applications of self healing bioconcrete single factor optimization experiments conducted on b cohnii by jiang et al 2020 found that the sporulation rate was 89 2 when sucrose was used at 3 5 g l concentration as carbon source 114 they have claimed that the sporulation rate was 82 3 when yeast extract was used as the nitrogen source at 4 0 g l it was concluded that the optimal conditions for the sporulation of b cohnii were ph 10 temperature at 30 c and 160 rpm shaking speed nevertheless not all bacterial spores have the required characteristics to be used as self healing agents research was also done to improve the application of micp by genetically engineered axenic cultures by incorporating bioremediase like gene of a thermophilic anaerobic bacterium bkh2 to alkaliphilic b subtilis a self healing biological agent was developed and used for developing bioconcrete that exhibited improved durability of the samples 115 microstructural studies confirmed the formation of a novel rod shaped gehlenite ca2al2sio7 phase along with calcite deposition inside the matrices of the altered b subtilis amended cementitious materials this development of rod shaped gehlenite significantly increased the self healing property as well as the durability and mechanical strength of bioconcrete for a prolonged period by filling the micro pores inside the samples 115 canolly et al 2013 transfected p aeruginosa mjk1 and e coli mjk2 to express green fluorescent protein and performed ureolysis to study the micp 116 in another study bergdale et al 2012 transfected p aeruginosa strains 8821 and pao1 with urease genes from s pasteurii 117 these were developed purely on an assumption basis that the inorganic caco3 and organic extracellular polymeric substances together with micp would be more effective self healing agents than the micp alone though there was significant improvement in the self healing abilities by altering the genetic content of the axenic cultures there is a requirement of skilled labour to do such transformations under controlled conditions which comes with the hidden high costs although appreciable self healing efficiency has been achieved through all these axenic culture studies the main hindrance to the application is the cost involved in preparing these cultures based on the production procedures silva revealed that the production cost operational expenditure and capital expenditure cost of b sphaericus spores is of the order 540 kg cdw and of b cohnii spores is 1175 kg cdw 50 thus these huge costs prevented the transition of the technology to the market axenic cultures on one hand are important to demonstrate the potential of the proposed microbial pathways for developing bioconcrete which are easy to control and to minimize the unexpected results however the use of these well controlled and pure cultures is limited due to the production costs 118 to avoid contamination inoculum is crucial for the successful production of axenic cultures thus a highly controlled environment and precise operations to produce the bioconcrete are required which is eventually expensive and impractical for low cost applications like bioconcrete 3 shift of the research focus towards non axenic cultures 3 1 non axenic cultures as the potential self healing agents to cut down the costs involved in the usage of axenic cultures as healing agents options such as decreasing the amount of bacterial agent to be used can be considered depending on the manufacturer s need can be considered another feasible alternative can be the replacement of axenic cultures with non axenic cultures 61 119 since the main driver for concrete industry is the low cost solutions for durability issues use of non axenic cultures can clear the path for the application of microbial self healing concrete silva et al 2015 made an effort to use the microbial community called cerup cyclicenriched ureolytic powder as a cheaper form of bio agent with the production cost operational expenditure and capital expenditure cost of 113 kg cdw and their work achieved a crack healing of up to 0 45 mm 119 apart from healing the concrete cracks investigations conducted by ersan et al 2018 revealed that the non axenic cultures can survive motor incorporation and inhibit the steel corrosion by accumulating no2 47 accordingly in order to reduce the cost of axenic culture productions the research focus shifted towards the use of non axenic cultures whose production and culturing is easier and less costly the works of silva et al 2015 reported that the use of non axenic cultures is 40 times less expensive than the use of axenic cultures 119 production of bioplastic and bioremediation are some instances of full scale implementation of mixed non axenic cultures 120 hence it is highly potential to use non axenic bacterial cultures to provide self healing capabilities to concrete structures as an alternative approach to axenic cultures most of the studies using axenic cultures are conducted in laboratories under nutrient rich conditions at temperatures between 20 c and 37 c which is impossible in the practical applications 121 122 moreover in the previous studies aerobic microbes such as ureolytic bacteria and myxobacteria are used in lab studies 84 85 however their end applications will be in deeper parts of concrete where anaerobic conditions prevail thus making their survival questionable 123 to cope up with these survival questions researchers are focusing on non axenic cultures with spore forming abilities which can depend on each other for their nutrient requirements and can also grow in anaerobic conditions 61 a compact and non axenic multi layered granular bacterial culture can be an option 124 it was reported that bacteria has the ability to create a self organizing clusters made up of compact self immobilized cells to protect themselves from harsh conditions 125 based on the cultivation process certain types of bacterial species in granulated cultures can be selectively enriched by altering the operational conditions and feed solution compositions 61 the compact form of granular culture protects the bacteria at the core 124 126 based on the formation mechanisms several categories of granulation genesis have been classified by the researchers 127 129 table 3 and fig 3 shows the overview of the theories that enabled the aerobic granules formation 129 moreover the study by lv et al 2013 revealed that the granulated bacteria can be dried stored and reactivated when necessary 130 thus ersan et al 2015 achieved self healing by developing a self protected granular culture in dried form which led to positive self healing results when compared to axenic cultures which were used as culture solutions 61 ecological friendliness has become a critical criterion for environmental technologies re use and recycle of some industrial side streams has become an inexpensive way to replace raw materials sewage sludge an alarming municipal waste is another biomaterial that forms the basis of sludge based aggregates and admixtures 148 activated sludge and a feed containing degradable carbon sources can be considered as raw material for the non axenic cultures 118 a regular activated sludge after drying can easily get about 12 kg m3 of dry organic matter which can be assumed as the non axenic culture production yield 118 moreover the average biomass yield from aerobic granulated sludge is about 0 6 g mlvss g cod 149 further studies using these mixed cultures should be performed as a potential approach to reduce the production cost one must keep in mind that waste sludge contains high organic substances and heavy metals and when it is used as a raw material for concrete there might be durability issues 150 151 thus there is a need for long term experiments to reuse sludge into construction materials in a way that it not only alleviates disposal problems but also has economic ecological and energy saving advantages studies conducted by reusing dry and wet sewage sludge with 5 of cement weight in concrete mix showed acceptable effect on concrete properties along with cost saving 152 3 2 non axenic granules for bioconcrete 3 2 1 cultivation of non axenic granules the non axenic microbial granules can be cultivated using rich growth media minimal nutrient media or to further reduce the cost industrial waste 61 153 in wastewater treatment process nitrogen reducing bacteria nrb and sulfate reducing bacteria srb exist because of the prevalence of their substrates in wastewater 154 there is literature available on the usage of axenic nrb and srb for bioconcrete development 44 46 these two bacteria do not require oxygen for their metabolism and thus they can survive longer on oxygen limited concrete 38 it was also found that in alkaline environment with ph up to 11 the spore forming haloalkaliphilic srb were active 68 this is similar to the fresh concrete conditions thus if both nrb and srb are cultivated in the same granule this could not only heal the concrete cracks but also reduces the cost of concrete production as wastewater is used for the cultivation of the non axenic cultures as srb are strict anaerobes while nrb can survive at high orp level srb will tend to grow in the inner layers of the granule if nrb and srb are cultivated in the non axenic granule form the nitrate reduction produces the carbonate ions and ammonia which increases the ph 87 and on the other hand sulfate reduction releases h2s gas which also increases the ph 89 this combined ph increases may be more when compared to the individual ph increase it must also be noted that the h2s release due to srb can lead to odour and downstream corrosion problems in systems like sewer pipes the released h2s can diffuse to areas with lower h2s concentration then the oxygen in the headspace of the sewer systems oxidize h2s to sulfate by the action of sob sulfate oxidizing bacteria as a result of this ph dramatically reduces and results in the formation of corrosion products such as ettringite and gypsum 15 89 satoh et al 2009 proved that sob and srb can co exist 155 the sulfate which is produced because of the sob activity along with the generated protons continuously diffuses into the anaerobic region and activates the srb not only this but also the variety of organic compounds in wastewater and volatile organics in sewer atmosphere diffuse into the corrosion layer and support the growth of the srb 24 156 because of these continuous diffusions the srb will be nurtured consequently the srb will consume sulfates increase ph and may also revert the corrosion products to concrete component calcite these synergistic effects among the nrb srb and sob may maximize the self healing and avoid the micc fig 4 our recent study has demonstrated the potential application of bioconcrete embedded with granular sludge cultivated using wastewater for the micc problem mainly attributed to the srb activities to be published there is increasing need for a corrosion resistant bioconcrete to solve this micc problem the potential bioconcrete can utilize some intrinsic wastewater bacteria that have the capabilities of growing as non axenic cultures precipitating calcite protecting themselves being environment friendly and corrosion resistant 3 2 2 non axenic granules obtained directly from wwtps 3 2 2 1 nereda granules nereda is an innovative cost effective and sustainable wastewater treatment technology based on aerobic granules 157 due to the limitation of oxygen diffusion several zones including aerobic anoxic and anaerobic zones are formed in the granules to achieve simultaneous cod n and p removal nereda granules can produce co2 and elevate ph by the denitrification process which favours the caco3 precipitation 2 organics o 2 c o 2 h 2 o aerobic zone 3 n h 4 o 2 n o x anoxic zone 4 organics n o x p o 4 3 n 2 c o 2 h 2 o poly p anaerobic zone though nereda granules are feasible for bioconcrete production the oxygen limitation in concrete and survival of different bacterial species becomes an issue for aerobic granules where different bacteria with various functions coexist this limitation makes the survival difficult which might also lead to deconstruction of the granules 3 2 2 2 granules from anaerobic wastewater reactors anaerobic reactors are advantageous over aerobic reactors in terms of reduced pollution load providing good stabilization of solids among various anaerobic reactors up flow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor uasb has achieved considerable success to treat a wide range of effluents from sugar pulp paper dairy chemical and coffee processing industries 158 159 with methanogens as the dominant species there is always excess co2 in the biogas that will favour the bio carbonation process however methanogens are sensitive to ph 6 8 7 5 and temperature 35 c or 55 c and are not suitable for the survival inside the concrete without further protections 160 table 4 summarizes the feasibility evaluation for granules based self healing concrete this concept is still a budding area and thus all indications gathered must be further pursued there is a need to address the problems such as the bacterial survival need for cultivation and production of toxins because of the micp process which might have environmental impacts to make this concept practical and to achieve the durability throughout the life of the structure effective wastewater granules are yet to be explored nonetheless the considerable potential with robust and more cost effective non axenic bacterial cultures warrants further investigations 3 3 recent developments on using non axenic cultures as self healing agents since 2015 there have been some new developments of bioconcrete using non axenic self protected bacterial cultures since 2015 61 119 erÅan et al 2015 opted granular cultures as an option for the use of non axenic bacteria in concrete and termed them as activated compact denitrifying core acdc 61 the systematic placement of cultures in a compact form is considered to be the main advantage of the granulated culture 161 in the granule different bacteria such as aerobic heterotrophs denitrifiers polyphosphate accumulating bacteria and nitrifiers grow at the same time also selective enrichment of particular species can be done by altering the cultivation process 61 besides the compact form and layered structure protect the bacterial core when being incorporated in bioconcrete 124 they can be dried stored and re activated in case of necessity 130 in a sequencing batch reactor the acdc granules were cultivated using synthetic wastewater and seed sludge from wastewater treatment plant the cultivated granules were dried in a drying tunnel with ventilation for 48 h at 60 61 the dried acdc powders were then mixed with the mortar specimens at different percentages w w relative to cement it was revealed that compared to axenic cultures the no3 reduction rate of acdc was at least 20 higher at ph 9 5 and was compatible with concrete up to the addition of 1 w w of cement the crack closure potential increased to 500 Î¼m width after 28 days of healing in comparison to that achieved by axenic culture after 56 days the watertightness regain by acdc was also higher than axenic cultures at the end of 28 days in this study it was found that 0 5 acdc in terms of cdw weight of cement i e 0 71 acdc w cement is enough to achieve a significant microbial induced crack closure in concrete after mixing with mortar specimens along with 3 ca no3 2 and 2 ca cooh 2 most importantly the study brought the bioconcrete technology closer to the application by reducing the cost by about 10 times in another study conducted by silva et al 2015 non axenic cultures in the form of cerup with the ability to sporulate hydrolyse urea and induce caco3 precipitation was produced from a sub stream of a vegetable treatment plant containing non axenic bacterial cultures 119 the cerup was dried and grounded to a particle size below 500 Î¼m in diameter and mixed with the mortar samples at a particular ratio the evaluated self healing abilities and comparisons with the axenic b sphaericus spores showed that cerup closed the cracks up to 0 5 mm after a healing period of 4 weeks which is higher than the maximum of 0 4 mm obtained with axenic culture in the same period also there is no need for the addition of highly nutritious compounds to activate the bacteria 102 it was also found that cerup constituted not only bacterial spores but also some carbonate salts which appeared to shield the spores from aggressive agents the co2 emissions from cerup production were 2 7 and 40 times lower than the cultivation of b sphaericus and b cohnii respectively and thus revealing the non axenic cultures to be more environmentally friendly 119 4 future perspectives and conclusions the research interest on self healing concrete is increasing in recent years and bioconcrete has great potentials in improving the durability and sustainability of the wastewater concrete structures at present the large scale studies and trials of this strategy are not up to the mark current major hurdles are due to the limited understanding of the long term performances such as bacterial survival in harsh concrete environments the sporulation and germination of microbes after years of service the lack of systematic and comparable evaluation methods micp tests self healing performance and cost evaluation in addition to addressing these challenges a breakthrough application needs to be identified for the large scale uptake of bioconcrete microbial self healing concrete for the construction of wastewater infrastructure is an innovative approach to heal the cracks and extend the service life of the infrastructure a further challenge is the high resistance to micp required for this self healing bioconcrete in wastewater environment specifically non axenic granules cultivated using wastewater could be the potential solution for bioconcrete to be used in wastewater systems like sewers the sporulation and germination of bacteria in the granules are the key to bioconcrete in the long run the germinated bacteria can use nutrients and substrate in wastewater to perform self healing overall this low cost bioconcrete using wastewater cultivated granules can serve as a suitable pilot product in the bioconcrete market declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of

13443,this paper summarized the metabolic pathways mechanisms and performance of various microbial induced calcite precipitation micp microorganisms as self healing agents for the development of self healing bioconcrete despite the remarkable progress achieved to date the high costs involved in the cultivation and encapsulation of the axenic cultures have led to a shift of research focus towards the use of non axenic microbial cultures they have superior benefits as self healing agents in terms of easy cultivation and low cost granular sludge was widely used in wastewater treatment considering the high need for concrete based wastewater infrastructure granular sludge cultivated using wastewater has the potential to develop bioconcrete for sewer systems and wastewater treatment plants to achieve large scale application future research should enhance the understanding of the long term performances and develop systematic and comparable evaluation methods keywords self healing bioconcrete axenic cultures non axenic cultures 1 introduction concrete is the most consumed material in the world by mass besides water 1 by its high compressive strength compatibility with reinforcement bars low cost availability and ease of casting in desired shapes and sizes concrete became the backbone for large scale constructions and infrastructures 2 yearly the consumption of concrete is approaching 30 billion tonnes and over past 65 years relative to the per capita production of other materials such as steel and wood there is a 10 fold increase in the concrete production 3 of all the concrete constructions sewer networks are of the most critical components that are required to prevent the exposure of humans to the unhygienic sewage nowadays the scale of these systems built is massive and if only china japan us uk and germany are considered the total length of sewer networks far exceeds the circumference of earth by more than 10 times 4 the total length of australia s sewer pipes is over 110 000 km and the overall estimated sewer asset value is reported to be 100 billion dollars 5 7 thus the durability of concrete is an important aspect to be considered in designing these structures concrete often suffers severe degradation and deterioration because of physical chemical and biological attacks these threatening factors along with the concrete s low tensile strength increase the tendency of cracking to address the tensile strength issues steel reinforcement bars are used and their good condition plays a vital role in the durability of the concrete structures the alkaline concrete environment provides a passivation effect on the rebar 8 however the increased permeability of concrete because of cracking exposes the steel reinforcement to the ambient conditions this exposure leads to the carbonation decrease in ph and eventually the hindrance of the passivation of rebar in the early ages although cracks do not pose a serious risk to the concrete strength their formation in the long run can lead to the reduction in the lifespan 9 13 not only cracking but sewer systems also face severe structural deterioration because of corrosion induced by microbes this corrosion termed as microbial induced concrete corrosion micc is one of the main factors for reducing the lifespan of the structures 14 15 for instance the service life of sewers was reduced from expected 100 years to 30 50 years and in extreme cases even below 10 years or lesser 14 16 the yearly rehabilitation costs for these sewer systems are estimated to be around 982 million in australia and more than 85 million in uk and 450 in germany while the usa need to spend around 390 billion in the coming 20 years 17 20 it also raises health and environmental concerns apart from high financial costs 14 21 24 various maintenance and repair methods passive treatment such as epoxy resin reinforcing grouting gravity filling using cementitious materials or epoxy injections were performed traditionally 13 25 to repair and maintain the cracks with a width of 400 Î¼m it costs approximately 250 m2 whereas the estimated cost of new concrete production is 44 m2 26 this raising cost of the sealing process made the researchers to look for another way of introducing applied biotechnology that heals the concrete their efforts led to the development of new domain called microbial concrete or self healing bioconcrete 27 29 in this strategy the concrete structures are treated with bacteria to induce calcium carbonate through a process called microbial induced calcite calcium carbonate precipitation micp which leads to the sealing of cracks by calcite 30 fig 1 apart from cracking and corrosion concrete s high co2 footprint is also a major drawback 31 an essential component of concrete is cement and its production faces challenges like depleting raw materials and fuel reserves and increasing environmental concerns if cement production is compared to a country it would be the third largest co2 emitter in the world accounting up to 2 8 billion tonnes exceeded only by china and the us 1 to address the environmental sustainability of concrete the microbial self healing concrete made by incorporating mineral producing bacteria can be a promising solution 32 33 there has been a significant volume of research done on various aspects of microbial concrete after the pioneering works of ramachandran et al 2001 34 fig 2 shows the exponentially growing research publications in this field there are some excellent review articles on self healing concrete based on three key taxonomies such as natural self healing chemical self healing and biological self healing 29 30 35 40 more recently effectiveness of self healing in actual structures and its potential to achieve sustainable concrete were explored 41 42 it is evident from the studies that the presence of bacteria in any form in concrete increases the strength in comparison to the traditional concrete 27 43 46 moreover the involvement of bacterial cultures prevents rebar from its corrosion by forming a passive layer 47 it was also proved that bioconcrete imparts protection by decreasing freeze thaw cracks 48 coming to the durability the research on bacteria based bioconcrete proved that it is denser and more durable than the traditional concrete 49 it may extend the existence of current constructions thus becoming a renewal alternative 48 when compared to traditional concrete though there are some initial cost issues involved in the bioconcrete development in the long run the self healing capabilities of bioconcrete will reduce the long term maintenance of structures 49 50 several authors have dealt with different microbial pathways such as urea hydrolysis denitrification methane oxidation and sulfate reduction since 2001 and they have achieved crack closure to a great extent 27 44 46 51 58 to the best of our knowledge most of the research work was done using single bacterial cultures that incurred hefty costs for their production and protection from the harsh concrete environments mostly ureolytic bacteria were used and they had survivability issues in the concrete s environment 59 60 only a few studies addressed these issues and considered self protected alternative microbial communities for calcium carbonate precipitation 61 moreover there are some questions regarding the functionality of the bacteria under realistic environmental conditions the previous research mostly carried out the testing of self healing and concrete properties shortly after casting and curing of concrete samples sometimes up to 6 months 45 47 57 61 62 as cracking can happen at any stage of the service life of the concrete structures there is a need for the durability study over years rather than just for weeks or months moreover there is a lack of data on the service life of the bioconcrete structures in comparison to general concrete ones a comprehensive review addressing all the aforementioned issues has not been found to gain a better overview this review aims to compile the drawbacks of the currently investigated micp pathways and it consolidates the reasons that led the researchers shift their focus towards the use of non axenic cultures as economically feasible healing agents in inducing calcium carbonate precipitation for persistent sealing of the cracks self healing bioconcrete could find large applications in wastewater infrastructure i e sewers wastewater treatment plants and other concrete structures due to the continuous investment harsh wastewater environment and high maintenance costs this review focuses on identifying bioconcrete as a preferential choice for the next generation wastewater infrastructure 2 the pioneering concept of microbial induced caco3 precipitation the contemporary times witnessed a ground breaking development of self healing concrete through the incorporation of bacterial cells to induce carbonate precipitation which in turn seals the crack this green approach was termed as microbial induced calcite precipitation micp by stocks fischer et al 1999 and the concrete which has been developed using this approach is called as self healing concrete or microbial concrete or bioconcrete 28 29 63 64 micp was first reported in the late 20th century in occurrence with urea decomposition by the marine microbiota 65 66 in biologically controlled mineralization process the microbe controls the nucleation and growth of the mineral particles to a large extent however micp is generally regarded as induced because the environmental conditions play a vital role in deciding the type of mineral produced without the involvement of specialized structures or molecular mechanisms 66 67 hammes and verstraete reported that the calcium concentration the concentration of dissolved inorganic carbon the ph and the availability of the nucleation sites are the four key factors that influence the caco3 precipitation 68 chemical precipitation of a compound occurs in aqueous solution when the solution is completely saturated with their ions the solubility product constant ksp of caco3 is 4 8 10 9 at 25 c 38 thus by increasing the concentration of co3 2 ions caco3 precipitation can occur in the presence of ca2 the precipitation reaction follows second order kinetics or pseudo first order kinetics if at all any of the reagent is present in excess 69 bacteria can regulate the formation of calcite crystal polymorphs and thus influences the saturation and rate of carbonate precipitation when the ksp is exceeded by the concentration of ca2 and co3 2 ions then the solution reaches supersaturation 70 eq 1 the higher the supersaturation the more will be the precipitation of calcite 1 s c a 2 c o 3 2 k s p microorganisms influence the precipitation process by altering almost any of the above mentioned factors either individually or in combination with others their key role has been attributed to their ability to increase the alkalinity of the environment by producing co3 2 ions through their metabolic pathways apart from the changes induced in the microenvironment bacteria also influence the caco3 precipitation by acting as nucleation sites at neutral ph the positively charged metal ions e g ca2 bind to the negatively charged groups on the microbial cell wall and subsequently react with anions e g carbonate to form an insoluble salt e g caco3 the mineral formation occurs when the required cation and anions are present in excess of saturation 32 furthermore it was demonstrated that the exopolysaccharides and amino acids present in the specific bacterial outer structures like glycol calyx and parietal polymers play a vital role in the morphology and mineralogy of micp 71 72 2 1 autotrophic and heterotrophic mediated calcite precipitation pathways following the above mentioned conditions bacteria precipitate caco3 through autotrophic and heterotrophic pathways table 1 and extensive research on these physiological processes were conducted by several researchers 73 78 in the autotrophic mediated pathway the microbes induce the caco3 precipitation in the presence of ca2 ions via conversion of carbon dioxide in its immediate environment this pathway includes anaerobic oxidation of methane anoxygenic and oxygenic photosynthesis 73 86 87 carbon dioxide is the carbon source for all the autotrophic pathways anaerobic oxidation of methane results in the production of bicarbonate by the electron acceptors such as sulfate in the presence of calcium the produced carbonate precipitates as caco3 whereas in photosynthesis process two groups namely oxygenic and anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria produce caco3 in the presence of calcium ions by utilizing water and hydrogen sulfide as electron donors respectively to produce methanal the removal of carbon dioxide from the bicarbonate solutions results in the carbonate production which leads to increase in localized ph and caco3 precipitation in the presence of calcium ions 68 88 despite the possibility of caco3 precipitation the fact that the autotrophic pathways require carbon dioxide as carbon source and light in case of photosynthesis poses several negative impacts for bioconcrete production bioconcrete based on this pathway can only be applied in those areas of concrete structures that are exposed to carbon dioxide and or light nitrogen cycle and sulfur cycle are the two heterotrophic mediated pathways through which caco3 precipitation occurs 33 the nitrogen cycle is further categorised into ammonification of amino acids dissimilatory nitrate reduction and urea degradation 87 carbonate bicarbonate ions or ammonia is produced as a metabolic end product in all these mechanisms ammonia production increases the alkalinity of the microenvironment and shifts the carbonate bicarbonate equilibria towards the precipitation of caco3 sulfate reducing bacteria srb carry out the sulfur cycle via dissimilatory sulfate reduction in an anoxic calcium and sulfate rich environment srb degrade the organic matter and produce bicarbonate ions and hydrogen sulfide h2s using so4 2 as terminal electron acceptor 89 in the presence of ca2 ions the degasification of h2s occurs and this increases the ph of the surrounding environment which eventually induces the caco3 precipitation some important research on the self healing performance of different types of bioconcrete are summarized in the table 2 2 2 drawbacks of the currently investigated micp pathways because of their pioneering works in the ornamental stone surfaces restoration adolphe et al 1990 obtained the patent for the micp technique termed bio concept of calcite or bio deposition which has expired in 2010 95 each of the pathways that has been incorporated for the studies witnessed some major drawbacks the microbial urea hydrolysis releases ammonia which is known for aquatic toxicity 96 both urea hydrolysis and the aerobic oxidation of methane pathways require o2 as the final electron acceptor yet in the concrete applications this is limited particularly in the deeper parts of the cracks not only this the solubility of o2 in water 9 1 mg l at 20 c is 102 to 105 times lower than the other types of electron acceptors such as no3 or so4 2 besides the caco3 precipitation itself entraps the bacterial cells and inhibit the o2 diffusion 97 unlike urea hydrolysis the aerobic respiration does not produce alkalinity which is the major inducing factor for calcite precipitation 98 though concrete has an alkaline environment in the long run this process might encounter alkalinity limitation issues when necessary nutrients are considered the urea hydrolysis requires yeast extract and urea and on the other side aerobic respiration requires either calcium lactate or calcium glutamate along with yeast extract which are incompatible with the cement matrix 99 102 therefore their incorporation should be limited to a certain extent there is a need to select beneficial micp pathways that work well with the concrete environment current research mainly studied self healing performance up to a few months nosouhian et al 2016 tested the increase of compressive strength of concrete to 20 with s pasteurii along with b subtilis after 28 days 62 xu and wang tested the crack healing of width 417 Î¼m following 28 days of incubation and ersan achieved a 465 Î¼m crack width healing after 56 days 45 57 in another study the effect of curing time on self healing efficiency was evaluated after 4 and 6 months of curing 47 61 no studies tested the long term durability for several years which are pertinent for practical self healing thus long term durability studies are needed since cracking can occur at any point during the service life of concrete structures 2 3 drawbacks of axenic cultures as self healing agents to date appreciable self healing concrete has been achieved by various researchers using axenic cultures 2 25 52 92 103 107 concrete poses a major hurdle to the survivability of the microbial life due to factors like the high alkaline condition ph 13 the absence of o2 pore size less than 0 1 nm and elevated temperatures during the curing in addition the shear stress forces because of concrete mixing during the preparation stage can kill many microorganisms 108 effective self healing is said to be done only when the sealing is persistent over the long term and performs throughout the life of the structures therefore to substantially increase the survivability of bacteria by protecting them from the harsh concrete environment several techniques like encapsulation immobilization are employed 25 52 106 109 encapsulation protects the bacteria from the mechanical forces during concrete preparation process and thereby increase the viability of bacteria for a long period of time 38 on the other hand immobilization using swollen hydrogels provides extra water supply and enhances the efficiency of calcite precipitation to fill the cracks of width up to 0 5 mm 38 silica can retain the enzyme activity if it is used as the immobilizing agent 110 along with these protective strategies bacterial spores were also used as bio agents due to their remarkable resistance to harsh conditions 111 because of the considerable ureolytic activity potential to induce calcite precipitation and ability to sporulate it was hypothesized that the incorporation of b sphaericus spores together with urea into the concrete would provide self healing properties 104 112 113 another sporulating bacteria b cohnii was also considered as a potential self healing agent for bioconcrete based on the assumption of calcite precipitation 105 it is reported that b sphaericus spores can heal the concrete cracks up to 1 mm when microencapsulated 92 encapsulated b cohnii spores in expanded clay perlite can heal up to 0 2 mm 103 research was also done to optimize the spore formations and thereby increasing the rate of sporulation is considered necessary to meet the requirements of industrial applications of self healing bioconcrete single factor optimization experiments conducted on b cohnii by jiang et al 2020 found that the sporulation rate was 89 2 when sucrose was used at 3 5 g l concentration as carbon source 114 they have claimed that the sporulation rate was 82 3 when yeast extract was used as the nitrogen source at 4 0 g l it was concluded that the optimal conditions for the sporulation of b cohnii were ph 10 temperature at 30 c and 160 rpm shaking speed nevertheless not all bacterial spores have the required characteristics to be used as self healing agents research was also done to improve the application of micp by genetically engineered axenic cultures by incorporating bioremediase like gene of a thermophilic anaerobic bacterium bkh2 to alkaliphilic b subtilis a self healing biological agent was developed and used for developing bioconcrete that exhibited improved durability of the samples 115 microstructural studies confirmed the formation of a novel rod shaped gehlenite ca2al2sio7 phase along with calcite deposition inside the matrices of the altered b subtilis amended cementitious materials this development of rod shaped gehlenite significantly increased the self healing property as well as the durability and mechanical strength of bioconcrete for a prolonged period by filling the micro pores inside the samples 115 canolly et al 2013 transfected p aeruginosa mjk1 and e coli mjk2 to express green fluorescent protein and performed ureolysis to study the micp 116 in another study bergdale et al 2012 transfected p aeruginosa strains 8821 and pao1 with urease genes from s pasteurii 117 these were developed purely on an assumption basis that the inorganic caco3 and organic extracellular polymeric substances together with micp would be more effective self healing agents than the micp alone though there was significant improvement in the self healing abilities by altering the genetic content of the axenic cultures there is a requirement of skilled labour to do such transformations under controlled conditions which comes with the hidden high costs although appreciable self healing efficiency has been achieved through all these axenic culture studies the main hindrance to the application is the cost involved in preparing these cultures based on the production procedures silva revealed that the production cost operational expenditure and capital expenditure cost of b sphaericus spores is of the order 540 kg cdw and of b cohnii spores is 1175 kg cdw 50 thus these huge costs prevented the transition of the technology to the market axenic cultures on one hand are important to demonstrate the potential of the proposed microbial pathways for developing bioconcrete which are easy to control and to minimize the unexpected results however the use of these well controlled and pure cultures is limited due to the production costs 118 to avoid contamination inoculum is crucial for the successful production of axenic cultures thus a highly controlled environment and precise operations to produce the bioconcrete are required which is eventually expensive and impractical for low cost applications like bioconcrete 3 shift of the research focus towards non axenic cultures 3 1 non axenic cultures as the potential self healing agents to cut down the costs involved in the usage of axenic cultures as healing agents options such as decreasing the amount of bacterial agent to be used can be considered depending on the manufacturer s need can be considered another feasible alternative can be the replacement of axenic cultures with non axenic cultures 61 119 since the main driver for concrete industry is the low cost solutions for durability issues use of non axenic cultures can clear the path for the application of microbial self healing concrete silva et al 2015 made an effort to use the microbial community called cerup cyclicenriched ureolytic powder as a cheaper form of bio agent with the production cost operational expenditure and capital expenditure cost of 113 kg cdw and their work achieved a crack healing of up to 0 45 mm 119 apart from healing the concrete cracks investigations conducted by ersan et al 2018 revealed that the non axenic cultures can survive motor incorporation and inhibit the steel corrosion by accumulating no2 47 accordingly in order to reduce the cost of axenic culture productions the research focus shifted towards the use of non axenic cultures whose production and culturing is easier and less costly the works of silva et al 2015 reported that the use of non axenic cultures is 40 times less expensive than the use of axenic cultures 119 production of bioplastic and bioremediation are some instances of full scale implementation of mixed non axenic cultures 120 hence it is highly potential to use non axenic bacterial cultures to provide self healing capabilities to concrete structures as an alternative approach to axenic cultures most of the studies using axenic cultures are conducted in laboratories under nutrient rich conditions at temperatures between 20 c and 37 c which is impossible in the practical applications 121 122 moreover in the previous studies aerobic microbes such as ureolytic bacteria and myxobacteria are used in lab studies 84 85 however their end applications will be in deeper parts of concrete where anaerobic conditions prevail thus making their survival questionable 123 to cope up with these survival questions researchers are focusing on non axenic cultures with spore forming abilities which can depend on each other for their nutrient requirements and can also grow in anaerobic conditions 61 a compact and non axenic multi layered granular bacterial culture can be an option 124 it was reported that bacteria has the ability to create a self organizing clusters made up of compact self immobilized cells to protect themselves from harsh conditions 125 based on the cultivation process certain types of bacterial species in granulated cultures can be selectively enriched by altering the operational conditions and feed solution compositions 61 the compact form of granular culture protects the bacteria at the core 124 126 based on the formation mechanisms several categories of granulation genesis have been classified by the researchers 127 129 table 3 and fig 3 shows the overview of the theories that enabled the aerobic granules formation 129 moreover the study by lv et al 2013 revealed that the granulated bacteria can be dried stored and reactivated when necessary 130 thus ersan et al 2015 achieved self healing by developing a self protected granular culture in dried form which led to positive self healing results when compared to axenic cultures which were used as culture solutions 61 ecological friendliness has become a critical criterion for environmental technologies re use and recycle of some industrial side streams has become an inexpensive way to replace raw materials sewage sludge an alarming municipal waste is another biomaterial that forms the basis of sludge based aggregates and admixtures 148 activated sludge and a feed containing degradable carbon sources can be considered as raw material for the non axenic cultures 118 a regular activated sludge after drying can easily get about 12 kg m3 of dry organic matter which can be assumed as the non axenic culture production yield 118 moreover the average biomass yield from aerobic granulated sludge is about 0 6 g mlvss g cod 149 further studies using these mixed cultures should be performed as a potential approach to reduce the production cost one must keep in mind that waste sludge contains high organic substances and heavy metals and when it is used as a raw material for concrete there might be durability issues 150 151 thus there is a need for long term experiments to reuse sludge into construction materials in a way that it not only alleviates disposal problems but also has economic ecological and energy saving advantages studies conducted by reusing dry and wet sewage sludge with 5 of cement weight in concrete mix showed acceptable effect on concrete properties along with cost saving 152 3 2 non axenic granules for bioconcrete 3 2 1 cultivation of non axenic granules the non axenic microbial granules can be cultivated using rich growth media minimal nutrient media or to further reduce the cost industrial waste 61 153 in wastewater treatment process nitrogen reducing bacteria nrb and sulfate reducing bacteria srb exist because of the prevalence of their substrates in wastewater 154 there is literature available on the usage of axenic nrb and srb for bioconcrete development 44 46 these two bacteria do not require oxygen for their metabolism and thus they can survive longer on oxygen limited concrete 38 it was also found that in alkaline environment with ph up to 11 the spore forming haloalkaliphilic srb were active 68 this is similar to the fresh concrete conditions thus if both nrb and srb are cultivated in the same granule this could not only heal the concrete cracks but also reduces the cost of concrete production as wastewater is used for the cultivation of the non axenic cultures as srb are strict anaerobes while nrb can survive at high orp level srb will tend to grow in the inner layers of the granule if nrb and srb are cultivated in the non axenic granule form the nitrate reduction produces the carbonate ions and ammonia which increases the ph 87 and on the other hand sulfate reduction releases h2s gas which also increases the ph 89 this combined ph increases may be more when compared to the individual ph increase it must also be noted that the h2s release due to srb can lead to odour and downstream corrosion problems in systems like sewer pipes the released h2s can diffuse to areas with lower h2s concentration then the oxygen in the headspace of the sewer systems oxidize h2s to sulfate by the action of sob sulfate oxidizing bacteria as a result of this ph dramatically reduces and results in the formation of corrosion products such as ettringite and gypsum 15 89 satoh et al 2009 proved that sob and srb can co exist 155 the sulfate which is produced because of the sob activity along with the generated protons continuously diffuses into the anaerobic region and activates the srb not only this but also the variety of organic compounds in wastewater and volatile organics in sewer atmosphere diffuse into the corrosion layer and support the growth of the srb 24 156 because of these continuous diffusions the srb will be nurtured consequently the srb will consume sulfates increase ph and may also revert the corrosion products to concrete component calcite these synergistic effects among the nrb srb and sob may maximize the self healing and avoid the micc fig 4 our recent study has demonstrated the potential application of bioconcrete embedded with granular sludge cultivated using wastewater for the micc problem mainly attributed to the srb activities to be published there is increasing need for a corrosion resistant bioconcrete to solve this micc problem the potential bioconcrete can utilize some intrinsic wastewater bacteria that have the capabilities of growing as non axenic cultures precipitating calcite protecting themselves being environment friendly and corrosion resistant 3 2 2 non axenic granules obtained directly from wwtps 3 2 2 1 nereda granules nereda is an innovative cost effective and sustainable wastewater treatment technology based on aerobic granules 157 due to the limitation of oxygen diffusion several zones including aerobic anoxic and anaerobic zones are formed in the granules to achieve simultaneous cod n and p removal nereda granules can produce co2 and elevate ph by the denitrification process which favours the caco3 precipitation 2 organics o 2 c o 2 h 2 o aerobic zone 3 n h 4 o 2 n o x anoxic zone 4 organics n o x p o 4 3 n 2 c o 2 h 2 o poly p anaerobic zone though nereda granules are feasible for bioconcrete production the oxygen limitation in concrete and survival of different bacterial species becomes an issue for aerobic granules where different bacteria with various functions coexist this limitation makes the survival difficult which might also lead to deconstruction of the granules 3 2 2 2 granules from anaerobic wastewater reactors anaerobic reactors are advantageous over aerobic reactors in terms of reduced pollution load providing good stabilization of solids among various anaerobic reactors up flow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor uasb has achieved considerable success to treat a wide range of effluents from sugar pulp paper dairy chemical and coffee processing industries 158 159 with methanogens as the dominant species there is always excess co2 in the biogas that will favour the bio carbonation process however methanogens are sensitive to ph 6 8 7 5 and temperature 35 c or 55 c and are not suitable for the survival inside the concrete without further protections 160 table 4 summarizes the feasibility evaluation for granules based self healing concrete this concept is still a budding area and thus all indications gathered must be further pursued there is a need to address the problems such as the bacterial survival need for cultivation and production of toxins because of the micp process which might have environmental impacts to make this concept practical and to achieve the durability throughout the life of the structure effective wastewater granules are yet to be explored nonetheless the considerable potential with robust and more cost effective non axenic bacterial cultures warrants further investigations 3 3 recent developments on using non axenic cultures as self healing agents since 2015 there have been some new developments of bioconcrete using non axenic self protected bacterial cultures since 2015 61 119 erÅan et al 2015 opted granular cultures as an option for the use of non axenic bacteria in concrete and termed them as activated compact denitrifying core acdc 61 the systematic placement of cultures in a compact form is considered to be the main advantage of the granulated culture 161 in the granule different bacteria such as aerobic heterotrophs denitrifiers polyphosphate accumulating bacteria and nitrifiers grow at the same time also selective enrichment of particular species can be done by altering the cultivation process 61 besides the compact form and layered structure protect the bacterial core when being incorporated in bioconcrete 124 they can be dried stored and re activated in case of necessity 130 in a sequencing batch reactor the acdc granules were cultivated using synthetic wastewater and seed sludge from wastewater treatment plant the cultivated granules were dried in a drying tunnel with ventilation for 48 h at 60 61 the dried acdc powders were then mixed with the mortar specimens at different percentages w w relative to cement it was revealed that compared to axenic cultures the no3 reduction rate of acdc was at least 20 higher at ph 9 5 and was compatible with concrete up to the addition of 1 w w of cement the crack closure potential increased to 500 Î¼m width after 28 days of healing in comparison to that achieved by axenic culture after 56 days the watertightness regain by acdc was also higher than axenic cultures at the end of 28 days in this study it was found that 0 5 acdc in terms of cdw weight of cement i e 0 71 acdc w cement is enough to achieve a significant microbial induced crack closure in concrete after mixing with mortar specimens along with 3 ca no3 2 and 2 ca cooh 2 most importantly the study brought the bioconcrete technology closer to the application by reducing the cost by about 10 times in another study conducted by silva et al 2015 non axenic cultures in the form of cerup with the ability to sporulate hydrolyse urea and induce caco3 precipitation was produced from a sub stream of a vegetable treatment plant containing non axenic bacterial cultures 119 the cerup was dried and grounded to a particle size below 500 Î¼m in diameter and mixed with the mortar samples at a particular ratio the evaluated self healing abilities and comparisons with the axenic b sphaericus spores showed that cerup closed the cracks up to 0 5 mm after a healing period of 4 weeks which is higher than the maximum of 0 4 mm obtained with axenic culture in the same period also there is no need for the addition of highly nutritious compounds to activate the bacteria 102 it was also found that cerup constituted not only bacterial spores but also some carbonate salts which appeared to shield the spores from aggressive agents the co2 emissions from cerup production were 2 7 and 40 times lower than the cultivation of b sphaericus and b cohnii respectively and thus revealing the non axenic cultures to be more environmentally friendly 119 4 future perspectives and conclusions the research interest on self healing concrete is increasing in recent years and bioconcrete has great potentials in improving the durability and sustainability of the wastewater concrete structures at present the large scale studies and trials of this strategy are not up to the mark current major hurdles are due to the limited understanding of the long term performances such as bacterial survival in harsh concrete environments the sporulation and germination of microbes after years of service the lack of systematic and comparable evaluation methods micp tests self healing performance and cost evaluation in addition to addressing these challenges a breakthrough application needs to be identified for the large scale uptake of bioconcrete microbial self healing concrete for the construction of wastewater infrastructure is an innovative approach to heal the cracks and extend the service life of the infrastructure a further challenge is the high resistance to micp required for this self healing bioconcrete in wastewater environment specifically non axenic granules cultivated using wastewater could be the potential solution for bioconcrete to be used in wastewater systems like sewers the sporulation and germination of bacteria in the granules are the key to bioconcrete in the long run the germinated bacteria can use nutrients and substrate in wastewater to perform self healing overall this low cost bioconcrete using wastewater cultivated granules can serve as a suitable pilot product in the bioconcrete market declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of

13444,here graphene oxide poly acrylamide 2 acrylamide methyl propanesulfonic acid sodium alginate go pa amps sa hydrogel was synthesized through a free radical polymerization approach the impact of graphene oxide go content on mechanical strength swelling behavior and the adsorption performance of prepared hydrogel was studied the operating parameters including contact time solution ph and initial cu ii content on the adsorption capacity of the hydrogel were studied the maximum cu ii adsorption capacity of 230 8 mg g was obtained for go pa amps sa under a ph of 5 the contact time of 270 min and adsorbent content of 0 5 g l at 25 c the high value of adsorption capacity after six adsorption desorption cycles indicated excellent reusability of the hydrogel absorbent the adsorption capability of synthesized hydrogel was also evaluated for cu ii elimination from industrial wastewater the cu ii concentration of wastewater decreased from 2 6 mg l to 0 1 mg l in the presence of synthesized hydrogel adsorbent the kinetic and isotherm investigation of cu ii adsorption for prepared hydrogels revealed that the pseudo second order and langmuir models fitted well with the kinetics and the isotherm data respectively the obtained e value of 0 01 kj mol using the dubinin radushkevitch d r isotherm model indicates that the physical adsorption dominates the adsorption process the relationships between the critical parameters in hydrogel and acquired adsorption data were investigated using the analysis of variance anova technique keywords hydrogel graphene oxide sodium alginate cu ll removal adsorption isotherms adsorption kinetic mathematical optimization 1 introduction the groundwater rivers and surface water contamination resulted from discharging aqueous solutions of heavy metals ions is becoming a severe issue due to toxicity and adverse impact on human health and the environment 1 accumulation of heavy metals in living organisms contaminates the food chains and consequently causes a potential health threat to consumers 1 2 copper ions are among the most common metal ions in wastewater which are toxic and detrimental to the environment and human health manufacturing processes such as mining steel production electrical industry and agriculture are the primary source of copper in the watercourses 3 it has been reported that higher copper concentrations than 1 mg l cause toxic impacts on the nervous system kidney liver heart and brain leading to various diseases such as hemolysis low blood pressure hepatitis cirrhosis gastrointestinal distress and convulsions 4 the potential toxicity of copper could be due to the conversions between cu ii and cu i which leads to producing superoxide and hydroxyl radicals 5 among various removal methods the adsorption technique is often considered as an efficient affordable non toxic and simple technique for removing metal ions from wastewater 4 6 the biocompatibility biodegradability and non toxicity of natural polymers have attracted considerable attention for their use in adsorption processes 7 the different kinds of natural and synthetic polymers including chitosan chitin and alginate in multiple forms of nanoparticles 8 11 hydrogels 12 15 nanofibers 16 18 were utilized to eliminate heavy metal ions from aqueous media hydrogel based adsorbents due to their macroscopic pores and surface functional groups such as hydroxyl carboxyl and amine to interact with metal ions are favorable for removing heavy metals from aqueous solutions 19 among different hydrogel based adsorbents biocompatible polyacrylamide pa based hydrogels have been widely applied for heavy metals elimination 20 22 and other toxic materials 23 24 from aquatic solutions the researches indicated that ionic strength plays a critical role in the chelating of pa based hydrogels with metal ions and therefore increasing their adsorption capacity 25 26 the adsorption capability of pa hydrogel could be significantly improved using the crosslinking of pa with ionic monomers like 2 acrylamido 2 methylpropanesulfonic acid amps 25 28 and itaconic acid 29 30 as a hydrophilic anionic monomer due to its sulfonic functional groups amps shows a high potential for chelating with cationic metal ions 26 moreover the hydrophilicity of polymers could be remarkably enhanced by crosslinking with amps which can improve their potential for biomedical 31 32 and environmental applications 33 however studies have been revealed that the application of poly acrylamide amps hydrogels for wastewater treatment has been limited due to their low mechanical properties 34 the mechanical properties of pa hydrogel could be improved by physically chemically crosslinking with sodium alginate sa 35 sa as a natural hydrophilic polysaccharide contains carboxylic groups that can chelate with cationic metals such as copper in aquatic solutions due to strong ion exchange properties 36 37 other inorganic and organic materials such as hydroxyapatite 38 and graphene oxide go 39 42 also loaded into the pa hydrogels could improve their mechanical properties the high density of epoxy hydroxyl and carboxyl functional groups and enormous surface area of go improve not only the mechanical strength of pa hydrogels but also the adsorption efficiency of pa hydrogels yang et al 39 utilized pa reduced go hydrogel composite to eliminate the pb ii and methylene blue from the aquatic system the pa go hydrogel capability was also investigated for cationic dyes adsorption by yang et al 40 their results indicated that the xerogels adsorbed the cationic dye molecules with a high adsorption value of 292 mg g 1 in other studies incorporated go nanosheets into the sodium acrylate acrylamide hydrogel and pa grafted graphene have been utilized to eliminate pb ii and cd ii from aqueous media 41 42 fan et al 35 evaluated the ability of go pa sa hydrogel nanocomposite for dyes adsorption they found that the go loading into the hydrogel improved the mechanical strength and adsorption property of synthesized hydrogel for dye removal zhuang et al examined the adsorption capability of alginate go towards cu ii and cr vi 43 the synthesized double network gad hydrogel demonstrated the maximum capacities of 169 5 and 72 5 mg g for copper and chromium ions sorption respectively in previous studies either go or amps and sa alone have been utilized to modify pa properties however the synergetic effects of all these compounds together on pa based hydrogel properties have not been investigated based on the properties mentioned above of go amps am and sa components it is expected that the contribution of all these properties would facilitate the creation of a novel pa based hydrogel with a high adsorption capacity towards heavy metal ions removal therefore the synthesized hydrogel with high adsorption capacity can be considered as a potential candidate for cu ii removal from industrial wastewater in this study the synergetic impact of go amps and sa on the mechanical resistance chemical stability and adsorption capability of pa hydrogel was investigated in this regard a crosslinked highly ordered quaternary composite of pa and with acrylamido 2 methylpropanesulfonic acid amps was fabricated by the free radical polymerization frp process in the presence of n n methylenebisacrylamide mba as a crosslinker and go and sa as fillers the polymerization of sa with pa in the presence of amps created a unique ordered structure the synthesized go pa amps sa composites were characterized using sem ftir xrd and tensile techniques the adsorption performance of prepared hydrogel was investigated for copper ions removal from synthesized and industrial wastewater to provide an understanding of the complexation and mechanism of the separation phenomenon in the adsorption experiment the impacts of contact time ph and cu ii initial content on the adsorption capability of prepared hydrogels were studied the pseudo first and second order kinetic models were manipulated to determine the kinetics of cu ii adsorption equilibrium data of copper adsorption using synthesized hydrogel was fitted with langmuir and freundlich isotherms as well moreover different mathematical modeling was performed to determine the adsorption capacity as a function of studied parameters the effect of each factor and the interaction between the parameters the results of the optimizations derived from the proposed models are illustrated 2 experimental 2 1

methods as described previously in the literature 44 at first graphite powder 3 00 g was mixed with concentrated h2so4 12 ml k2s2o8 2 50 g and p2o5 2 50 g the obtained solution was stirred for 5 h at 80 c in an oil bath after diluting with 500 ml of di water the oxidized graphite was filtered using a 0 2 Î¼m nylon film washed and dried under ambient conditions in the second step the oxidized graphite was mixed with the concentrated h2so4 460 ml in an ice bath afterward kmno4 60 g was gently added under a temperature below 10 c after 2 h stirring at 35 c the mixture was diluted using di water 920 ml under temperature below 50 c followed by stirring for 2 h after that di water 2 8 l and 30 h2o2 50 ml were poured into the mixture the obtained product was washed with a 10 hcl solution followed by di water to increase the ph 2 3 preparation of polyacrylamide based hydrogel cross linked composite of pa amps polymers with sa and go were synthesized via free radical polymerization followed by ionically crosslinking calcium ions pa 1 5 neutralized amps 1 5 g and sa 0 2 g were dissolved in the di water 20 ml then mba 0 05 g as a crosslinker and pps 0 1 g as initiator were added to the obtained solution the solution was purged with n2 gas for 10 min and stirred for 24 h until the reaction was completed afterward the prepared mixture was transferred into the silicone molds and dried at 60 c for 2 h for ionic crosslinking the synthesized hydrogel named pa amps sa was immersed in a 4 cacl2 solution for 24 h the pa amps sa hydrogel was transferred into deionized water for a further 24 h to remove the uncross linked monomers and finally freeze dried for 24 h to synthesize go based pa amps sa composite hydrogels go solutions 20 ml with different content were sonicated for 30 min then pa 1 5 g neutralized amps 1 5 g and sa 0 2 g were dissolved in the go suspension the following steps in synthesis were similar to pa amps sa hydrogels the scheme of the synthesis procedure has been shown in fig 1 table 1 represents the contents of each component in the samples according to the hydrogels synthesis procedure 2 4 characterization of synthesized hydrogels the chemical composition of go and hydrogels were defined by a fourier transfer infrared ftir spectroscopy perkin elmer spectrum gx ftir spectrometer ranging from 500 to 4000 cm 1 the crystal structure of go nanosheets was determined by x ray panalytical almelo netherlands ranging from 5 to 80 and raman spectroscopy senterra using an excitation wavelength of 785 nm the morphology of the prepared go and fabricated hydrogels before and after adsorption was studied identified using field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem tescan mira iii czech republic equipped with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx oxford detector the tensile tests of synthesized hydrogels were carried out by a testing machine hounsfield h5ks with a crosshead rate of 2 mm min at 25 c the flame atomic absorption spectrophotometer faas perkin elmer 603 was used to determine copper ions content the pore structure of the synthesized materials was characterized by n2 adsorption at 77 k using an adsorption apparatus quantachrome instrument and the surface area of the samples was determined from the brunauer emmett teller bet equation and pore volume from the total amount of nitrogen adsorbed at relative pressures of p p0 0 96 2 5 swelling equilibria and adsorption experiments the swelling percentage of the synthesized hydrogels was performed by soaking 100 mg hydrogel in 1000 ml water for 24 h the swelling value can be calculated using eq 1 1 s w e l l i n g w 1 w 0 w 0 where w1 and w0 are the swollen and dry hydrogels weights respectively the go loading effect on the adsorption capability of synthesized hydrogels was studied as well in this regards cu ii ions adsorption was carried out in 100 ml falcon tubes containing 25 mg of the synthesized hydrogel as adsorbent and 50 ml of cu ii 100 mg l 1 at 25 c on a rotary shaker at 150 rpm under various times up to 6 h the impact of ph in the range of 2 7 on the adsorption capacity of optimized hydrogel was evaluated by adjusting ph with 0 1 m hcl 0 1 m naoh solution the contact time effect 5 360 min was investigated at a ph of 5 the adsorbent loading of 0 5 mg ml initial concentration of 100 mg l 1 cu ii and 25 c furthermore the effect of the cu ii initial content was examined in the range of 100 500 mgl 1 for cu ii ions adsorption at 25 c for 240 min the adsorption capacity of adsorbents was determined using eq 2 2 q e c 0 c e v 1000 m where c0 and ce mgl 1 are the cu ii initial and equilibrium contents respectively m is the adsorbent weight g and v presents the liquid volume ml 2 6 kinetics and isotherm parameters reusability of hydrogels the pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic models were applied to the experimental adsorptive data obtained for hydrogels 45 the nonlinear kinetic models were given as follows 3 pseudo first order q t q e 1 exp k 1 t 4 pseudo second order q t k 2 q e 2 t 1 k 2 q e t where qt and qe mg g 1 are the adsorption capacities at the time of t and when the reaction

the synthesized hydrogels were examined by langmuir and freundlich isotherm models as follows 45 5 langmuir q e q m b c e 1 b c e 6 freundlich q e k f c e 1 n where kf mgg 1 n and qm mgg 1 b mg 1 are the freundlich and langmuir parameters respectively the industrial wastewater sample was provided from eshtehard industrial town iran with a ph of 6 2 cu ii concentration of 2 6 mgl 1 and cod of 1400 mgl without any treatment the suspended solids were removed by filtration using wattman paper the synthesized hydrogels were regenerated using 0 2 m hcl and water and dried at 50 c for 6 h the reusability of hydrogel was performed for six adsorption desorption cycles 2 7 statistical analysis the statistical analysis was manipulated to analyze the experimental data using anova in order to investigate the relationships between the critical parameters in hydrogel and acquired adsorption data the fit model quality was demonstrated using the determination coefficient of r2 and f value design expert software was utilized for statistical analysis as an approach to specify the optimum settings of variables to define optimum performance levels for one or more responses mathematical optimization has been investigated on cu concentration and obtained capacity the mathematical optimization was performed using spss software the purpose was to estimate the experimental ranges of the independent variables that simultaneously create the desirable predicted adsorption responses while maximizing the overall adsorption capacity 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization the fesem image of go nanosheets in fig s1a showed the synthesis of interlinked three dimensional go sheets with a porous structure the xrd pattern of go nanosheets was presented in fig s1b the observed diffraction peak at 2Î¸ 9 is the characteristic of the reflection plane 002 of the go indicating the interplanar distance of go sheets the raman spectrum of go sheets was also illustrated in fig s1c the observed d band at 1312 cm 1 was related to the defects and disordered nature of graphene sheets and a broad g band at 1584 cm 1 could be because of the e2g first order scattering mode 46 the sem images of synthesized pa amps sa and go8 pa amps sa before and after the adsorption were illustrated in fig 2 chemical bonds between pa and sa in pa amps sa created a hydrogel with a three dimensional internal porous structure and finger like pores texture matrix the polymerization of pa and sa in the presence of amps creates a highly ordered structure in the synthesized composite amps is a strongly dissociating acid pka 2 that makes acidic conditions and allows nearly complete in situ hydrolysis of all amide groups of pa to react with sa besides amps incorporates sulfonic acid groups into the pa and sa matrix 47 fig 2a and b 35 furthermore the vinyl structure of the amps by minimizing the chain transfer reaction allows the formation of high molecular weight generation with ordered structure 48 the immobilization of go sheets into the pa amps sa matrix changed the morphology of macroporous hydrogel and produced the dense lamellar structure in comparison to pa amps sa hydrogel fig 2c and d implying the intense interaction between go sheets and functional groups in the surface of pa amps sa hydrogel and excellent dispersion of go sheets into the pa amps sa matrix adsorption of copper ions on go8 pa amps sa occurring via carboxylate sulfinyl carbonyl amino hydroxyl functional of hydrogel led to the occupation of some pores by the cu ii ions the hydrogel holes were relatively irregular compared to regular pores of go8 pa amps sa before adsorption as demonstrated in fig 2e and f the comparison of edx analysis of synthesized go8 pa amps sa before and after the adsorption process has been confirmed the presence of cu ii ions into go8 pa amps sa network after adsorption fig 2g and h the ftir spectra of pa amps pa amps sa and go8 pa amps sa are illustrated in fig 3 the observed peak at 2931 cm 1 in the ftir spectra of pa amps hydrogel was related to the ch stretching vibration of the ch2 group the amide carbonyl group was detected at 1611 cm 1 the observed peaks at 1043 cm 1 and 1117 cm 1 could be assigned to the carboxylate symmetric stretching of so and asymmetric stretch vibrations of pa amps 33 in the ftir spectra of pa amps sa hydrogel the observed new bonds at 804 cm 1 and 917 cm 1 were because of the mannuronic acid functional group and the uronic acid in the sa structure the observed peak at 1611 cm 1 in the ftir spectra of go8 pa amps sa was shifted to 1641 cm 1 which could be related to the interaction of go nanosheets with nh groups of the pa via hydrogen bonds the broad peak at 3200 3500 cm 1 belongs to the oh group of the h2o 47 48 nitrogen adsorption desorption tests of dry hydrogels were performed the surface areas were 130 3 dmÂ² g and 49 4 dmÂ² g for go8 pa amps sa and pa amps sa respectively the obtained bet data was in agreement with the other similar studies in the literature 49 it should be highlighted that the surface area was enhanced after the incorporation of go onto the pa amps hydrogel which is consistent with our results that hydrogels with graphene perform better towards copper ions adsorption the pore volume and size evaluation are reported in table s2 in the supplementary information besides the adsorption desorption isotherm has been demonstrated in fig s2 in the supplementary information the tensile mechanical measurement was performed fig 4 a and the results of various synthesized hydrogels with different go concentrations are illustrated in fig 4b as results demonstrate pa amps sa indicated a higher elasticity than pa amps showing the introduction of sodium alginate to pa amps significantly increased the elasticity of obtained hydrogel increasing the go content from 1 g l to 8 g l led to enhancing the compressive stress at the deformation point from 6 mpa to 1 23 mpa confirming the increase of the strength the compressive strengths of pa amps pa amps sa and go1 pa amps sa go2 pa amps sa go4 pa amps sa and go8 pa amps sa hydrogels were found to be 0 08 mpa 0 47 mpa 0 6 mpa 0 81 mpa 1 01 mpa 1 09 mpa and 1 23 mpa respectively therefore the go8 pa amps sa hydrogel demonstrated the best mechanical properties than other synthesized hydrogels the crosslinking of go with pa amps sa matrix restricted the motion of macromolecular chains of the hydrogel increasing the compressive strength of the hydrogel besides carboxylic and hydroxyl groups on go sheets play an essential role in the mechanical strength of pa amps sa hydrogels increasing the go concentration enhances the number of carboxylic and hydroxyl groups improving the compressive strength of synthesized hydrogel 50 51 however the uniform dispersion of higher concentrations than 8 g l of go into the hydrogel solution was challenging the effect of go content on the swelling behavior of synthesized hydrogels was illustrated in fig 4c the obtained results indicated that the loading of go nanosheets up to 1 g l led to a decrease in the mobility of hydrogel chains because of an increase in the cross linked points by the go cross linked agents as a consequence the swelling percentage of hydrogel was reduced the swelling ratio of composite hydrogels increased at higher go concentrations than 1 g l the hydrophilic groups of go sheets containing hydroxyl carbonyl and carboxyl groups increased the hydrophilic groups density of the synthesized hydrogels network therefore the water diffusion into the hydrogel networks was raised which resulted in an increasing swelling percentage of composite hydrogels at higher go concentrations than 1 g l 52 53 3 2 adsorption studies the contact time ph and initial cu ii content effect on the adsorption capacity of the synthesized hydrogels were investigated fig 5 fig 5a demonstrated the contact time impact toward cu ii sorption under experimental conditions the results revealed that approximately 80 of total adsorption occurred during 120 min while the adsorption of cu ii ions into synthesized hydrogels reached the equilibrium after 270 min the high porosity of the hydrogels and the considerable number of functional groups like carboxylate sulfinyl carbonyl amino hydroxyl etc on the adsorbent surface led to faster adsorption of cu ii ions during the first 2 h increasing the concentration of go sheets in the pa amps sa hydrogels resulted in an enhancement in the adsorption capability of pa amps sa hydrogels due to the interaction of oxygen containing functional groups on the surface of go with cu ii ions as the results indicated there is not that much difference between adsorption capacities of go4 pa amps sa and go8 pa amps sa for cu ii ions sorption the reason is that although loading of go into the pa amps sa created more ionic adsorption sites for cu ii ions the higher concentration of go retarded the diffusion rate of cu ii ions into the inner adsorbent pores 54 therefore go8 pa amps sa which demonstrated maximum adsorption capacity among the synthesized hydrogel nanocomposites was selected for further investigations fig 5b showed the ph effect on the cu ii adsorption on pa amps sa and go8 pa amps sa hydrogels the obtained results demonstrated that the maximum adsorption capacity of both pa amps sa and go8 pa amps sa hydrogels was achieved at a ph of 5 for cu ii sorption at lower ph values the electrostatic repulsions between the protonated functional groups on the adsorbent surface and positively charged cu ii ions retarded the effective interaction among the adsorbent and ions as a result the hydrogel sorption capacity was decreased furthermore the competition between cu ii ions and hydrogen for chelating with surface functional groups of hydrogel adsorbents reduced the adsorption capacity at lower ph values increasing the ph enhanced the significant interaction between cu ii cations and carboxylate sulfonyl carbonyl amino hydroxyl functional groups of pa amps sa and go8 pa amps sa hydrogels therefore the cu ii adsorption capacity was improved in ph values higher than 5 the formation of hydroxylated cu ii ions in cu oh 2 form and their competition with cu ii ions for chelating with functional groups of pa amps sa and go8 pa amps sa hydrogels decreased the adsorption capacity of both pa amps sa and go8 pa amps sa hydrogels therefore a ph of 5 was chosen as an optimum ph for further experiments 55 56 the impact of the cu ii initial content on the adsorption capacity of pa amps sa and go8 pa amps sa hydrogels fig 5c demonstrated that increasing initial cu ii concentration retarded the adsorption capacity enhancement because of trapping available active sites of the adsorbent 3 3 reusability and application for actual wastewater treatment the reusability of pa amps sa and go8 pa amps sa hydrogels for the adsorption of cu ii ions was studied during six sorption desorption cycles the obtained results fig 5d demonstrated that the go8 pa amps sa showed excellent reusability within six adsorption desorption cycles since the adsorption capacity of go8 pa amps sa did not significantly change and more than 80 of total sorption of cu ii was achieved after six cycles the robust mechanical strength and improved chemical stability of the go8 pa amps sa compared to pa amps sa could be the reason for better stability of go8 pa amps sa hydrogel adsorbent the capability of synthesized go8 pa amps sa hydrogel was evaluated for industrial wastewater pulp industry treatment with initial cu ii concentration and cod chemical oxygen demand values of 2 6 mg l and 1400 mg l respectively in summary cu ii concentration and cod value of industrial wastewater decreased to 0 1 mg l and 220 mg l respectively thus the go8 pa amps sa has an appropriate capability to adsorb heavy metal ions from wastewater of the pulp industry 3 4 optimization analysis the contact time effect on the adsorbent capacity of go8 pa amps sa was optimized considering cu ii interaction with adsorbent in order to achieve the maximum adsorption capacity of the hydrogel and the results are illustrated in fig 6 a d according to the optimization results obtained for the adsorbent capacity in terms of the time and cu concentration ce contact time has a positive effect and the ce showed a negative influence on the adsorbent capacity of go8 pa amps sa fig 6a besides their mutual interaction also increases the considered adsorbent capacity a graphical overview of the optimized solution is depicted in fig 6b in this graph flat ramps imply uniform desirability whereas inclined ramps demonstrate an extremum expected value factors and responses are represented by red and blue dots respectively and the level of desirability achieved upon optimization corresponds to the height of the dot contour plot for desirability achievement according to the defined criteria as well as a three dimensional surface plot of adsorption capacity versus both time and cu content for go8 pa amps sa hydrogel were demonstrated in fig 6c and d respectively these graphs implied the achievement of 74 6 mg g as a maximum adsorption capacity desirability achievement when the concentration of cu was set between 62 7 ppm and 100 ppm during the contact time of 280 85 min the optimization results for the contact time and cu ll initial concentration on the adsorption capacity of go8 pa amps sa were summarized in table s2 in the supplementary information the ph effect on adsorption capacity of go8 pa amps sa considering the synergic impact of cu concentration and ph on interaction was optimized in order to achieve the maximum adsorption capacity for go8 pa amps sa the results represented in fig 7 a to d show the ph and cu concentration interaction under each condition as well as their associated effect on adsorption capacity the optimal ph and cu concentration were obtained by superimposing the contour plots of the responses ramps a graphical representation of the optimal solution are depicted in fig 7a contour plot for desirability based on the pre defined aspect as well as a three dimensional surface plot of adsorption capacity as a function of both ph and cu content for go8 pa amps sa hydrogel were demonstrated in fig 7c and d respectively based on obtained results the adsorption capacity of 75 243 mg g as a desirable achievement was obtained when the concentration of cu ll was set at 29 41 ppm at a ph of 6 87 the optimization results were summarised in table s3 in the supplementary information 3 5 kinetics and isotherm mechanism pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic models have been employed to study the kinetics of cu ii adsorption on synthesized hydrogels these two kinetic models were given as the equations eqs 3 and 4 respectively in order to fit the obtained data from the experiments with kinetic models qt as a function of time for the pseudo first order and the pseudo second order are depicted in fig 8 a and b respectively the obtained kinetic parameters of cu ii adsorption are summarized in table 2 the comparison of the determination coefficients r2 of applied models implies that the kinetics of cu ii adsorption is well fitted with the pseudo second order equation with r2 of 0 9978 and the surface adsorption assigned as a potential rate controlling step besides the adsorption rate on the hydrogel surface is equivalent to the square of the number of unoccupied hydrogel sites 55 57 further investigation of pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic models has been conducted through anova and statistical analyses to confirm the suitability of the pseudo second order kinetic model for describing the adsorption phenomena the obtained results are presented in tables s4 and s5 respectively the determination coefficients obtained from the statistical nonlinear regression model for first order kinetics r2 0 9924 reduced chi sqr 3 870 and second order kinetics r2 0 9978 reduced chi sqr 1 145 demonstrated that the nonlinear regression model well followed the pseudo second order equation the higher f value of 18860 for second order kinetics compared to this amount for first order kinetics 5577 from variance analysis implied that this model is significant the langmuir and freundlich isotherm models were applied to express the equilibrium adsorption of cu ii ions on go8 pa amps sa hydrogel as the equations eqs 5 and 6 respectively 47 the experimental data fitting with these two models is depicted in fig 9 a and b respectively the obtained parameters for these two isotherms are summarized in table 3 the values of the determination coefficient r2 0 9959 demonstrated that the equilibrium data of cu ii sorption were fitted well with the langmuir isotherm model 58 therefore the monolayer sorption of cu ii ions was predominant for cu ii sorption using go8 pa amps sa hydrogels 59 the maximum adsorption capacity of the obtained monolayer through this model for cu ii ions using go8 pa amps sa hydrogels was 230 8 mg g further investigation of cu ii adsorption behavior on go8 pa amps sa surface has been conducted by anova and statistical analyses to verify the correlation between the dependent variable qe and the independent variable ce for freundlich isotherm and langmuir isotherms the obtained results have been shown in tables s6 and s7 in supporting information the higher determination coefficients of the nonlinear regression r2 adjusted 0 9959 reduced chi sqr 11 15 for responses of qe and ce demonstrated a well fitting of the regression model for langmuir isotherm furthermore considering the variance analysis the f value of 4698 for the langmuir model compared to 661 in freundlich isotherm also suggested the significant relationship between the response variable and the predictors for the langmuir model dubinin radushkevitch d r isotherm model has been applied to verify the adsorption type physical or chemical and the adsorption energy the nonlinear d r equation is as below 7 q e q m e x p k Îµ 2 where qe qm

mol ion is adsorbed on the surface can be determined using the following equation 10 e 2 k 0 5 the e value less than 8 kj mol depicts physical adsorption while the chemical adsorption has values of 9 16 kj mol the obtained e value of 0 01 kj mol using the d r isotherm model indicates that the physical adsorption dominates the system which means that adsorption proceeds by the formation of van der waals interaction 60 d r diagram has been shown in fig s3 the maximum adsorption capacity of go8 pa amps sa hydrogel towards cu ii was compared to the other hydrogels previously reported the summarized results in table 4 revealed that the adsorption capacity of synthesized go8 pa amps sa hydrogel for cu ii sorption is higher than the other hydrogel adsorbents studied in the literature the highest adsorption capacity of go8 pa amps sa hydrogel could be attributed to the simultaneous presence of amps and go which enhanced the adsorption capacity of pa through the chelating of functional groups of go and amps with cu ii ions 4 conclusion in this work go pa amps sa hydrogels were prepared by the free radical polymerization method different go content on the mechanical properties swelling behavior and adsorption capacity of synthesized hydrogels were studied the obtained results were revealed that increasing the go content from 1 g l to 8 g l led to the rising of both compressive stress and swelling ratio where go8 pa amps sa hydrogel has the best mechanical properties compared to other synthesized hydrogels in contrast the minimum swelling percentage was obtained for go1 pa amps sa hydrogel the capability of prepared hydrogels was investigated for cu ii sorption from aqueous solution and industrial wastewater and the synthesized go8 pa amps sa was chosen as an optimum adsorbent for cu ii adsorption regarding the adsorption capacity and mechanical properties the impact of contact time ph and initial cu ii content on the adsorption of cu ii in go8 pa amps sa

13444,here graphene oxide poly acrylamide 2 acrylamide methyl propanesulfonic acid sodium alginate go pa amps sa hydrogel was synthesized through a free radical polymerization approach the impact of graphene oxide go content on mechanical strength swelling behavior and the adsorption performance of prepared hydrogel was studied the operating parameters including contact time solution ph and initial cu ii content on the adsorption capacity of the hydrogel were studied the maximum cu ii adsorption capacity of 230 8 mg g was obtained for go pa amps sa under a ph of 5 the contact time of 270 min and adsorbent content of 0 5 g l at 25 c the high value of adsorption capacity after six adsorption desorption cycles indicated excellent reusability of the hydrogel absorbent the adsorption

relationships between the critical parameters in hydrogel and acquired adsorption data were investigated using the analysis of variance anova technique keywords hydrogel graphene oxide sodium alginate cu ll removal adsorption isotherms adsorption kinetic mathematical optimization 1 introduction the groundwater rivers and surface water contamination resulted from discharging aqueous solutions of heavy metals ions is becoming a severe issue due to toxicity and adverse impact on human health and the environment 1 accumulation of heavy metals in living organisms contaminates the food chains and consequently causes a potential health threat to consumers 1 2 copper ions are among the most common metal ions in wastewater which are toxic and detrimental to the environment and human health manufacturing processes such as mining steel production electrical industry and agriculture are the primary source of copper in the watercourses 3 it has been reported that higher copper concentrations than 1 mg l cause toxic impacts on the nervous system kidney liver heart and brain leading to various diseases such as hemolysis low blood pressure hepatitis cirrhosis gastrointestinal distress and convulsions 4 the potential toxicity of copper could be due to the conversions between cu ii and cu i which leads to producing superoxide and hydroxyl radicals 5 among various removal methods the adsorption technique is often considered as an efficient affordable non toxic and simple technique for removing metal ions from wastewater 4 6 the biocompatibility biodegradability and non toxicity of natural polymers have attracted considerable attention for their use in adsorption processes 7 the different kinds of natural and synthetic polymers including chitosan chitin and alginate in multiple forms of nanoparticles 8 11 hydrogels 12 15 nanofibers 16 18 were utilized to eliminate heavy metal ions from aqueous media hydrogel based adsorbents due to their macroscopic pores and surface functional groups such as hydroxyl carboxyl and amine to interact with metal ions are favorable for removing heavy metals from aqueous solutions 19 among different hydrogel based adsorbents biocompatible polyacrylamide pa based hydrogels have been widely applied for heavy metals elimination 20 22 and other toxic materials 23 24 from aquatic solutions the researches indicated that ionic strength plays a critical role in the chelating of pa based hydrogels with metal ions and therefore increasing their adsorption capacity 25 26 the adsorption capability of pa hydrogel could be significantly improved using the crosslinking of pa with ionic monomers like 2 acrylamido 2 methylpropanesulfonic acid amps 25 28 and itaconic acid 29 30 as a hydrophilic anionic monomer due to its sulfonic functional groups amps shows a high potential for chelating with cationic metal ions 26 moreover the hydrophilicity of polymers could be remarkably enhanced by crosslinking with amps which can improve their potential for biomedical 31 32 and environmental applications 33 however studies have been revealed that the application of poly acrylamide amps hydrogels for wastewater treatment has been limited due to their low mechanical properties 34 the mechanical properties of pa hydrogel could be improved by physically chemically crosslinking with sodium alginate sa 35 sa as a natural hydrophilic polysaccharide contains carboxylic groups that can chelate with cationic metals such as copper in aquatic solutions due to strong ion exchange properties 36 37 other inorganic and organic materials such as hydroxyapatite 38 and graphene oxide go 39 42 also loaded into the pa hydrogels could improve their mechanical properties the high density of epoxy hydroxyl and carboxyl functional groups and enormous surface area of go improve not only the mechanical strength of pa hydrogels but also the adsorption efficiency of pa hydrogels yang et al 39 utilized pa reduced go hydrogel composite to eliminate the pb ii and methylene blue from the aquatic system the pa go hydrogel capability was also investigated for cationic dyes adsorption by yang et al 40 their results indicated that the xerogels adsorbed the cationic dye molecules with a high adsorption value of 292 mg g 1 in other studies incorporated go nanosheets into the sodium acrylate acrylamide hydrogel and pa grafted graphene have been utilized to eliminate pb ii and cd ii from aqueous media 41 42 fan et al 35 evaluated the ability of go pa sa hydrogel nanocomposite for dyes adsorption they found that the go loading into the hydrogel improved the mechanical strength and adsorption property of synthesized hydrogel for dye removal zhuang et al examined the adsorption capability of alginate go towards cu ii and cr vi 43 the synthesized double network gad hydrogel demonstrated the maximum capacities of 169 5 and 72 5 mg g for copper and chromium ions sorption respectively in previous studies either go or amps and sa alone have been utilized to modify pa properties however the synergetic effects of all these compounds together on pa based hydrogel properties have not been investigated based on the properties mentioned above of go amps am and sa components it is expected that the contribution of all these properties would facilitate the creation of a novel pa based hydrogel with a high adsorption capacity towards heavy metal ions removal therefore the synthesized hydrogel with high adsorption capacity can be considered as a potential candidate for cu ii removal from industrial wastewater in this study the synergetic impact of go amps and sa on the mechanical resistance chemical stability and adsorption capability of pa hydrogel was investigated in this regard a crosslinked highly ordered quaternary composite of pa and with acrylamido 2 methylpropanesulfonic acid amps was fabricated by the free radical polymerization frp process in the presence of n n methylenebisacrylamide mba as a crosslinker and go and sa as fillers the polymerization of sa with pa in the presence of amps created a unique ordered structure the synthesized go pa amps sa composites were characterized using sem ftir xrd and tensile techniques the adsorption performance of prepared hydrogel was investigated for copper ions removal from synthesized and industrial wastewater to provide an understanding of the complexation and mechanism of the separation phenomenon in the adsorption experiment the impacts of contact time ph and cu ii initial content on the adsorption capability of prepared hydrogels were studied the pseudo first and second order kinetic models were manipulated to determine the kinetics of cu ii adsorption equilibrium data of copper adsorption using synthesized hydrogel was fitted with langmuir and freundlich isotherms as well moreover different mathematical modeling was performed to determine the adsorption capacity as a function of studied parameters the effect of each factor and the interaction between the parameters the results of the optimizations derived from the proposed models are illustrated 2 experimental 2 1

followed by di water to increase the ph 2 3 preparation of polyacrylamide based hydrogel cross linked composite of pa amps polymers with sa and go were synthesized via free radical polymerization followed by ionically crosslinking calcium ions pa 1 5 neutralized amps 1 5 g and sa 0 2 g were dissolved in the di water 20 ml then mba 0 05 g as a crosslinker and pps 0 1 g as initiator were added to the obtained solution the solution was purged with n2 gas for 10 min and stirred for 24 h until the reaction was completed afterward the prepared mixture was transferred into the silicone molds and dried at 60 c for 2 h for ionic crosslinking the synthesized hydrogel named pa amps sa was immersed in a 4 cacl2 solution for 24 h the pa amps sa hydrogel was transferred into deionized water for a further 24 h to remove the uncross linked monomers and finally freeze dried for 24 h to synthesize go based pa amps sa composite hydrogels go solutions 20 ml with different content were sonicated for 30 min then pa 1 5 g neutralized amps 1 5 g and sa 0 2 g were dissolved in the go suspension the following steps in synthesis were similar to pa amps sa hydrogels the scheme of the synthesis procedure has been shown in fig 1 table 1 represents the contents of each component in the samples according to the hydrogels synthesis procedure 2 4 characterization of synthesized hydrogels the chemical

spectrophotometer faas perkin elmer 603 was used to determine copper ions content the pore structure of the synthesized materials was characterized by n2 adsorption at 77 k using an adsorption apparatus quantachrome instrument and the surface area of the samples was determined from the brunauer emmett teller bet equation and pore volume from the total amount of nitrogen adsorbed at relative pressures of p p0 0 96 2 5 swelling equilibria and adsorption experiments the swelling percentage of the synthesized hydrogels was performed by soaking 100 mg hydrogel in 1000 ml water for 24 h the swelling value can be calculated using eq 1 1 s w e l l i n g w 1 w 0 w 0 where w1 and w0 are the swollen and dry hydrogels weights respectively the go loading effect on the adsorption capability of synthesized hydrogels was studied as well in this regards cu ii ions adsorption was carried out in 100 ml falcon tubes containing 25 mg of the synthesized hydrogel as adsorbent and 50 ml of cu ii 100 mg l 1 at 25 c on a rotary shaker at 150 rpm under various times up to 6 h the impact of ph in the range of 2 7 on the adsorption capacity of optimized hydrogel was evaluated by adjusting ph with 0 1 m hcl 0 1 m naoh solution the contact time effect 5 360 min was investigated at a ph of 5 the adsorbent loading of 0 5 mg ml initial concentration of 100 mg l 1 cu ii and 25 c furthermore the effect of the cu ii initial content was examined in the range of 100 500 mgl 1 for cu ii ions adsorption at 25 c for 240 min the adsorption capacity of adsorbents was determined using eq 2 2 q e c 0 c e v 1000 m where c0 and ce mgl 1 are the cu ii initial and equilibrium contents respectively m is the adsorbent weight g and v presents the liquid volume ml 2 6 kinetics and isotherm parameters reusability of hydrogels the pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic models were applied to the experimental adsorptive data obtained for hydrogels 45 the nonlinear kinetic models were given as follows 3 pseudo first order q t q e 1 exp k 1 t 4 pseudo second order q t k 2 q e 2 t 1 k 2 q e t where qt and qe mg g 1 are the adsorption capacities at the time of t and when the reaction reached the equilibrium condition respectively k1 min 1 and k2 g mg 1 min 1 are the pseudo first order and pseudo second order constant rates respectively the equilibrium data of cu ii adsorption on the synthesized hydrogels were examined by langmuir and freundlich isotherm models as follows 45 5 langmuir q e q m b c e 1 b c e 6 freundlich q e k f c e 1 n where kf mgg 1 n and qm mgg 1 b mg 1 are the freundlich and langmuir parameters respectively the industrial wastewater sample was provided from eshtehard industrial town iran with a ph of 6 2 cu ii concentration of 2 6 mgl 1 and cod of 1400 mgl without any treatment the suspended solids were removed by filtration using wattman paper the synthesized hydrogels were regenerated using 0 2 m hcl and water and dried at 50 c for 6 h the reusability of hydrogel was performed for six adsorption desorption cycles 2 7 statistical analysis the statistical analysis was manipulated to analyze the experimental data using anova in order to investigate the relationships between the critical parameters in hydrogel and acquired adsorption data the fit model quality was demonstrated using the determination coefficient of r2 and f value design expert software was utilized for statistical analysis as an approach to specify the optimum settings of variables to define optimum performance levels for one or more responses mathematical optimization has been investigated on cu concentration and obtained capacity the mathematical optimization was performed using spss software the purpose was to estimate the experimental ranges of the independent variables that simultaneously create the desirable predicted adsorption responses while maximizing the overall adsorption capacity 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization the fesem image of go nanosheets in fig s1a showed the synthesis of interlinked three dimensional go sheets with a porous structure the xrd pattern of go nanosheets was presented in fig s1b the observed diffraction peak at 2Î¸ 9 is the characteristic of the reflection plane 002 of the go indicating the interplanar distance of go sheets the raman spectrum of go sheets was also illustrated in fig s1c the observed d band at 1312 cm 1 was related to the defects and disordered nature of graphene sheets and a broad g band at 1584 cm 1 could be because of the e2g first order scattering mode 46 the sem images of synthesized pa amps sa and go8 pa amps sa before and after the adsorption were illustrated in fig 2 chemical bonds between pa and sa in pa amps sa created a hydrogel with a three dimensional internal porous structure and finger like pores texture matrix the polymerization of pa and sa in the presence of amps creates a highly ordered structure in the synthesized composite amps is a strongly dissociating acid pka 2 that makes acidic conditions and allows nearly complete in situ hydrolysis of all amide groups of pa to react with sa besides amps incorporates sulfonic acid groups into the pa and sa matrix 47 fig 2a and b 35 furthermore the vinyl structure of the amps by minimizing the chain transfer reaction allows the formation of high molecular weight generation with ordered structure 48 the immobilization of go sheets into the pa amps sa matrix changed the morphology of macroporous hydrogel and produced the dense lamellar structure in comparison to pa amps sa hydrogel fig 2c and d implying the intense interaction between go sheets and functional groups in the surface of pa amps sa hydrogel and excellent dispersion of go sheets into the pa amps sa matrix adsorption of copper ions on go8 pa amps sa occurring via carboxylate sulfinyl carbonyl amino hydroxyl functional of hydrogel led to the occupation of some pores by the cu ii ions the hydrogel holes were relatively irregular compared to regular pores of go8 pa amps sa before adsorption as demonstrated in fig 2e and f the comparison of edx analysis of synthesized go8 pa amps sa before and after the adsorption process has been confirmed the presence of cu ii ions into go8 pa amps sa network after adsorption fig 2g and h the ftir spectra of pa amps pa amps sa and go8 pa amps sa are illustrated in fig 3 the observed peak at 2931 cm 1 in the ftir spectra of pa amps hydrogel was related to the ch stretching vibration of the ch2 group the amide carbonyl group was detected at 1611 cm 1 the observed peaks at 1043 cm 1 and 1117 cm 1 could be assigned to the carboxylate symmetric stretching of so and asymmetric stretch vibrations of pa amps 33 in the ftir spectra of pa amps sa hydrogel the observed new bonds at 804 cm 1 and 917 cm 1 were because of the mannuronic acid functional group and the uronic acid in the sa structure the observed peak at 1611 cm 1 in the ftir spectra of go8 pa amps sa was shifted to 1641 cm 1 which could be related to the interaction of go nanosheets with nh groups of the pa via hydrogen bonds the broad peak at 3200 3500 cm 1 belongs to the oh group of the h2o 47 48 nitrogen adsorption desorption tests of dry hydrogels were performed the surface areas were 130 3 dmÂ² g and 49 4 dmÂ² g for go8 pa amps sa and pa amps sa respectively the obtained bet data was in agreement with the other similar studies in the literature 49 it should be highlighted that the surface area was enhanced after the incorporation of go onto the pa amps hydrogel which is consistent with our results that hydrogels with graphene perform better towards copper ions adsorption the pore volume and size evaluation are reported in table s2 in the supplementary information besides the adsorption desorption isotherm has been demonstrated in fig s2 in the supplementary information the tensile mechanical measurement was performed fig 4 a and the results of various synthesized hydrogels with different go concentrations are illustrated in fig 4b as results demonstrate pa amps sa indicated a higher elasticity than pa amps showing the introduction of sodium alginate to pa amps significantly increased the elasticity of obtained hydrogel increasing the go content from 1 g l to 8 g l led to enhancing the compressive stress at the deformation point from 6 mpa to 1 23 mpa confirming the increase of the strength the compressive strengths of pa amps pa amps sa and go1 pa amps sa go2 pa amps sa go4 pa amps sa and go8 pa amps sa hydrogels were found to be 0 08 mpa 0 47 mpa 0 6 mpa 0 81 mpa 1 01 mpa 1 09 mpa and 1 23 mpa respectively therefore the go8 pa amps sa hydrogel demonstrated the best mechanical properties than other synthesized hydrogels the crosslinking of go with pa amps sa matrix restricted the motion of macromolecular chains of the hydrogel increasing the compressive strength of the hydrogel besides carboxylic and hydroxyl groups on go sheets play an essential role in the mechanical strength of pa amps sa hydrogels increasing the go concentration enhances the number of carboxylic and hydroxyl groups improving the compressive strength of synthesized hydrogel 50 51 however the uniform dispersion of higher concentrations than 8 g l of go into the hydrogel solution was challenging the effect of go content on the swelling behavior of synthesized hydrogels was illustrated in fig 4c the obtained results indicated that the loading of go nanosheets up to 1 g l led to a decrease in the mobility of hydrogel chains because of an increase in the cross linked points by the go cross linked agents as a consequence the swelling percentage of hydrogel was reduced the swelling ratio of composite hydrogels increased at higher go concentrations than 1 g l the hydrophilic groups of go sheets containing hydroxyl carbonyl and carboxyl groups increased the hydrophilic groups density of the synthesized hydrogels network therefore the water diffusion into the hydrogel networks was raised which resulted in an increasing swelling percentage of composite hydrogels at higher go concentrations than 1 g l 52 53 3 2 adsorption studies the contact time ph and initial cu ii content effect on the adsorption capacity of the synthesized hydrogels were investigated fig 5 fig 5a demonstrated the contact time impact toward cu ii sorption under experimental conditions the results revealed that approximately 80 of total adsorption occurred during 120 min while the adsorption of cu ii ions into synthesized hydrogels reached the equilibrium after 270 min the high porosity of the hydrogels and the considerable number of functional groups like carboxylate sulfinyl carbonyl amino hydroxyl etc on the adsorbent surface led to faster adsorption of cu ii ions during the first 2 h increasing the concentration of go sheets in the pa amps sa hydrogels resulted in an enhancement in the adsorption capability of pa amps sa hydrogels due to the interaction of oxygen containing functional groups on the surface of go with cu ii ions as the results indicated there is not that much difference between adsorption capacities of go4 pa amps sa and go8 pa amps sa for cu ii ions sorption the reason is that although loading of go into the pa amps sa created more ionic adsorption sites for cu ii ions the higher concentration of go retarded the diffusion rate of cu ii ions into the inner adsorbent pores 54 therefore go8 pa amps sa which demonstrated maximum adsorption capacity among the synthesized hydrogel nanocomposites was selected for further investigations fig 5b showed the ph effect on the cu ii adsorption on pa amps sa and go8 pa amps sa hydrogels the obtained results demonstrated that the maximum adsorption capacity of both pa amps sa and go8 pa amps sa hydrogels was achieved at a ph of 5 for cu ii sorption at lower ph values the electrostatic repulsions between the protonated functional groups on the adsorbent surface and positively charged cu ii ions retarded the effective interaction among the adsorbent and ions as a result the hydrogel sorption capacity was decreased furthermore the competition between cu ii ions and hydrogen for chelating with surface functional groups of hydrogel adsorbents reduced the adsorption capacity at lower ph values increasing the ph enhanced the significant interaction between cu ii cations and carboxylate sulfonyl carbonyl amino hydroxyl functional groups of pa amps sa and go8 pa amps sa hydrogels therefore the cu ii adsorption capacity was improved in ph values higher than 5 the formation of hydroxylated cu ii ions in cu oh 2 form and their competition with cu ii ions for chelating with functional groups of pa amps sa and go8 pa amps sa hydrogels decreased the adsorption capacity of both pa amps sa and go8 pa amps sa hydrogels therefore a ph of 5 was chosen as an optimum ph for further experiments 55 56 the impact of the cu ii initial content on the adsorption capacity of pa amps sa and go8 pa amps sa hydrogels fig 5c demonstrated that increasing initial cu ii concentration retarded the adsorption capacity enhancement because of trapping available active sites of the adsorbent 3 3 reusability and application for actual wastewater treatment the reusability of pa amps sa and go8 pa amps sa hydrogels for the adsorption of cu ii ions was studied during six sorption desorption cycles the obtained results fig 5d demonstrated that the go8 pa amps sa showed excellent reusability within six adsorption desorption cycles since the adsorption capacity of go8 pa amps sa did not significantly change and more than 80 of total sorption of cu ii was achieved after six cycles the robust mechanical strength and improved chemical stability of the go8 pa amps sa compared to pa amps sa could be the reason for better stability of go8 pa amps sa hydrogel adsorbent the capability of synthesized go8 pa amps sa hydrogel was evaluated for industrial wastewater pulp industry treatment with initial cu ii concentration and cod chemical oxygen demand values of 2 6 mg l and 1400 mg l respectively in summary cu ii concentration and cod value of industrial wastewater decreased to 0 1 mg l and 220 mg l respectively thus the go8 pa amps sa has an appropriate capability to adsorb heavy metal ions from wastewater of the pulp industry 3 4 optimization analysis the contact time effect on the adsorbent capacity of go8 pa amps sa was optimized considering cu ii interaction with adsorbent in order to achieve the maximum adsorption capacity of the hydrogel and the results are illustrated in fig 6 a d according to the optimization results obtained for the adsorbent capacity in terms of the time and cu concentration ce contact time has a positive effect and the ce showed a negative influence on the adsorbent capacity of go8 pa amps sa fig 6a besides their mutual interaction also increases the considered adsorbent capacity a graphical overview of the optimized solution is depicted in fig 6b in this graph flat ramps imply uniform desirability whereas inclined ramps demonstrate an extremum expected value factors and responses are represented by red and blue dots respectively and the level of desirability achieved upon optimization corresponds to the height of the dot contour plot for desirability achievement according to the defined criteria as well as a three dimensional surface plot of adsorption capacity versus both time and cu content for go8 pa amps sa hydrogel were demonstrated in fig 6c and d respectively these graphs implied the achievement of 74 6 mg g as a maximum adsorption capacity desirability achievement when the concentration of cu was set between 62 7 ppm and 100 ppm during the contact time of 280 85 min the optimization results for the contact time and cu ll initial concentration on the adsorption capacity of go8 pa amps sa were summarized in table s2 in the supplementary information the ph effect on adsorption capacity of go8 pa amps sa considering the synergic impact of cu concentration and ph on interaction was optimized in order to achieve the maximum adsorption capacity for go8 pa amps sa the results represented in fig 7 a to d show the ph and cu concentration interaction under each condition as well as their associated effect on adsorption capacity the optimal ph and cu concentration were obtained by superimposing the contour plots of the responses ramps a graphical representation of the optimal solution are depicted in fig 7a contour plot for desirability based on the pre defined aspect as well as a three dimensional surface plot of adsorption capacity as a function of both ph and cu content for go8 pa amps sa hydrogel were demonstrated in fig 7c and d respectively based on obtained results the adsorption capacity of 75 243 mg g as a desirable achievement was obtained when the concentration of cu ll was set at 29 41 ppm at a ph of 6 87 the optimization results were summarised in table s3 in the supplementary information 3 5 kinetics and isotherm mechanism pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic models have been employed to study the kinetics of cu ii adsorption on synthesized hydrogels these two kinetic models were given as the equations eqs 3 and 4 respectively in order to fit the obtained data from the experiments with kinetic models qt as a function of time for the pseudo first order and the pseudo second order are depicted in fig 8 a and b respectively the obtained kinetic parameters of cu ii adsorption are summarized in table 2 the comparison of the determination coefficients r2 of applied models implies that the kinetics of cu ii adsorption is well fitted with the pseudo second order equation with r2 of 0 9978 and the surface adsorption assigned as a potential rate controlling step besides the adsorption rate on the hydrogel surface is equivalent to the square of the number of unoccupied hydrogel sites 55 57 further investigation of pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic models has been conducted through anova and statistical analyses to confirm the suitability of the pseudo second order kinetic model for describing the adsorption phenomena the obtained results are presented in tables s4 and s5 respectively the determination coefficients obtained from the statistical nonlinear regression model for first order kinetics r2 0 9924 reduced chi sqr 3 870 and second order kinetics r2 0 9978 reduced chi sqr 1 145 demonstrated that the nonlinear regression model well followed the pseudo second order equation the higher f value of 18860 for second order kinetics compared to this amount for first order kinetics 5577 from variance analysis implied that this model is significant the langmuir and freundlich isotherm models were applied to express the equilibrium adsorption of cu ii ions on go8 pa amps sa hydrogel as the equations eqs 5 and 6 respectively 47 the experimental data fitting with these two models is depicted in fig 9 a and b respectively the obtained parameters for these two isotherms are summarized in table 3 the values of the determination coefficient r2 0 9959 demonstrated that the equilibrium data of cu ii sorption were fitted well with the langmuir isotherm model 58 therefore the monolayer sorption of cu ii ions was predominant for cu ii sorption using go8 pa amps sa hydrogels 59 the maximum adsorption capacity of the obtained monolayer through this model for cu ii ions using go8 pa amps sa hydrogels was 230 8 mg g further investigation of cu ii adsorption behavior on go8 pa amps sa surface has been conducted by anova and statistical analyses to verify the correlation between the dependent variable qe and the independent variable ce for freundlich isotherm and langmuir isotherms the obtained results have been shown in tables s6 and s7 in supporting information the higher determination coefficients of the nonlinear regression r2 adjusted 0 9959 reduced chi sqr 11 15 for responses of qe and ce demonstrated a well fitting of the regression model for langmuir isotherm furthermore considering the variance analysis the f value of 4698 for the langmuir model compared to 661 in freundlich isotherm also suggested the significant relationship between the response variable and the predictors for the langmuir model dubinin radushkevitch d r isotherm model has been applied to verify the adsorption type physical or chemical and the adsorption energy the nonlinear d r equation is as below 7 q e q m e x p k Îµ 2 where qe qm k and Îµ are adsorption capacity theoretical adsorption capacity constant of adsorption energy and polanyi potential respectively polanyi potential can be expressed as below 8 Îµ r t l n 1 1 c e 9 q e q m e x p k r t ln 1 1 c e 2 where r is the gas constant 8 314 j mol k t is the temperature 298 k and ce is the equilibrium concentration of cu ii the e value known as the free energy change when 1 mol ion is adsorbed on the surface can be determined using the following equation 10 e 2 k 0 5 the e value less than 8 kj mol depicts physical adsorption while the chemical adsorption has values of 9 16 kj mol the obtained e value of 0 01 kj mol using the d r isotherm model indicates that the physical adsorption dominates the system which means that adsorption proceeds by the formation of van der waals interaction 60 d r diagram has been shown in fig s3 the maximum adsorption capacity of go8 pa amps sa hydrogel towards cu ii was compared to the other hydrogels previously reported the summarized results in table 4 revealed that the adsorption capacity of synthesized go8 pa amps sa hydrogel for cu ii sorption is higher than the other hydrogel adsorbents studied in the literature the highest adsorption capacity of go8 pa amps sa hydrogel could be attributed to the simultaneous presence of amps and go which enhanced the adsorption capacity of pa through the chelating of functional groups of go and amps with cu ii ions 4 conclusion in this work go pa amps sa hydrogels were prepared by the free radical polymerization method different go content on the mechanical properties swelling behavior and adsorption capacity of synthesized hydrogels were studied the obtained results were revealed that increasing the go content from 1 g l to 8 g l led to the rising of both compressive stress and swelling ratio where go8 pa amps sa hydrogel has the best mechanical properties compared to other synthesized hydrogels in contrast the minimum swelling percentage was obtained for go1 pa amps sa hydrogel the capability of prepared hydrogels was investigated for cu ii sorption from aqueous solution and industrial wastewater and the synthesized go8 pa amps sa was chosen as an optimum adsorbent for cu ii adsorption regarding the adsorption capacity and mechanical properties the impact of contact time ph and initial cu ii content on the adsorption of cu ii in go8 pa amps sa were studied the maximum adsorption capacity of cu ii ions was found to be 230 8 mgg 1 under ph of 5 equilibrium time of 270 min the adsorbent dosage of 0 5 g l and 25 c the kinetic and equilibrium data of cu ii adsorption using go8 pa amps sa hydrogel were well explained using pseudo second order kinetic and langmuir isotherm models the better reusability and higher adsorption capacity were achieved for go8 pa amps sa hydrogel adsorbent after six sorption desorption cycles the cu ii concentration of wastewater was decreased from 2 6 mgl 1 to 0 1 mgl 1 in the presence of go8 pa amps sa hydrogel adsorbent the obtained results indicated a high potential of go8 pa amps sa hydrogel to eliminate heavy metal ions from wastewaters the statistical analysis was applied to analyze the experimental data statistical characteristics analysis of variance covariance and residuals statistics of the linear model between the hydrogels with different amount of go and contact time have been
