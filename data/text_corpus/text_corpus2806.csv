14030,dual layer hollow fiber membrane dlhfm offers the flexibility to independently tailor the outer and inner surface of hollow fiber membrane in a single step the optimization of key spinning parameters is crucial to attain the desired membrane properties to suit its application in this study polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf dlhfm incorporated with titania nanotube boron tnt b in the outer layer was developed via dry wet spinning using a triple orifice spinneret as synthesized tnt b served as a promising nanofiller to improve the hydrophilicity flux and rejection of dlhfm bore fluid flow rate bffr outer layer dope solution flow rate olfr air gap ag and nanofiller loading during the dlhf spinning were optimized through experimental approach the resultant membranes exhibited triple layered sandwich structure with a dense interlayer in the middle between a long finger like asymmetrical structure in its inner layer and a thinner finger like structure underneath the selective layer on the outer layer of membrane the separation performances for bovine serum albumin bsa lignin and tannic acid ta of prepared membranes were evaluated dlhfm spun with bffr of 3 ml min olfr of 3 ml min ag of 10 cm and nanofiller loading of 2 wt exhibited the optimal performance by achieving pure water bsa lignin and ta flux of 97 65 l m2h 106 78 l m2h 37 48 l m2h 25 46 l m2h and rejection of 99 12 99 06 and 78 51 respectively keywords dual layer hollow fiber membrane at pome ultrafiltration colour removal 1 introduction the rapid development of membrane technology is attributed to its wide acceptance in a huge array of industries which require efficient separation techniques at low cost and low energy consumption 1 membrane based separation processes have been applied to treat wastewater and effluents from various sectors such as petrochemical electronics and agriculture in malaysia the discharge of agricultural waste has posed significant risk to the water source and environment 2 as the second largest palm oil producers in the world large quantity of palm oil mill effluent pome has also been produced in malaysia it is estimated that in average a total of 53 million m3 of pome is produced in malaysia 3 palm oil extraction process is a water intensive process in which it is estimated that every tonne of palm oil produces 7 tonnes of pome 4 pome is highly greasy effluent filled with organic matter and with high chemical oxygen demand cod 30 000 60 000 mg l and biochemical oxygen demand bod 10 000 25 000 mg l levels 5 prior to its discharge pome is commonly treated using conventional method such as aerobic and anaerobic digestion in multiple ponds for 20 60 days the final effluent produced is known as aerobically treated palm oil mill effluent at pome which is characterised by its brownish coloration due to the presence of lignocellulosic matters such as lignin and tannins 6 even though this effluent passes the stringent discharge requirements the presence of pigments poses negative impacts towards the receiving water bodies 7 studies have shown that natural water bodies that are contaminated with pigments may undergo eutrophication and lead to the systemic collapse of local aquatic systems 8 additionally the intrusion of pigments into natural water bodies may render water unusable for domestic purposes membrane filtration is a viable alternative to provide a tertiary polishing step to remove pigments present in at pome to mitigate any harmful outcome towards receiving water bodies both nanofiltration nf and ultrafiltration uf membranes have been used for the removal of pigments at varying degrees of success amat et al treated at pome using conventional nf flat sheet membranes where a removal of 99 69 was achieved at a pressure of 10 bar 9 subramaniam et al prepared tnt pvdf based hollow fiber uf membranes and reported colour removal of 58 9 10 it has been generally observed that nf suffers from severe fouling despite the promising removal efficiency whereas uf membranes cannot sufficiently remove the colour pigments a new class of membranes known as mixed matrix membranes mmm has been introduced to mitigate the limitation of conventional membranes in mmm nanomaterials which endowed with exceptional physico chemical properties such as high surface area and highly hydrophilic are dispersed across the membrane matrix the field of membrane technology experienced a significant breakthrough when it was evident that the addition of such nanomaterials can impart specific characteristics which can play a role in improving membrane performance in the past decade the incorporation of nanomaterials such as graphene 11 graphene oxide go 12 titania based nanomaterials 10 13 silica 14 and metal organic frameworks mof 15 16 have brought about improved productivity and rejection capability currently researchers have shifted their attention on developing hybrid nanomaterials which can impart multiple unique characteristics on the resultant mmm for example arumugham et al prepared a nano cuo g c3n4 g cn sheets which was incorporated into a polyphenylsulfone ppsu membrane for protein removal from water 17 the embedded nanomaterial did not only increase the membrane permeation and rejection capabilities but also imparted antifouling properties similarly wang et al developed a thin film nanocomposite membrane embedded with two dimensional mxene ti3c2tx for desalination purpose 18 the incorporation of this unique nanofiller brought about several distinct improvement on membrane performance including antifouling chlorine resistance and improved flux such improvements are directly linked to the properties of the nanomaterials however one common problem faced by mmm is the uneven and uncontrollable distribution of the nanomaterials across the membrane structure this condition is detrimental to nanocomposite membranes which require specific surface characteristics such as antifouling and antibacterial as the nanoparticles that are embedded deep in membrane matrix may be rendered useless or less effectiveness recent development on the configuration of annular spinnerets has opened to the possibility of fabricating dual layer hollow fiber membranes dlhfm where membranes are prepared using two distinct dope solutions to obtain membranes with inner and outer layers with tailored properties for specific applications 19 this also allows a higher degree of control on nanomaterial dispersion where it can be concentrated on membrane outer layer during the spinning process sun et al developed a polyamide imide cellulose acetate dlhfm for the nanofiltration of divalent and monovalent anions for desalination purposes 20 the spinneret design allowed the formation of dense inner layer while forming a less defective but thicker dense selective skin similarly setiawan et al developed a nf dlhfm using poly amide imide pai as the selective layer and polyether sulfone psf as the inner support layer for water softening purpose 21 the pai coating was able to increase the hydrophilicity and improved rejection of salts 22 another work conducted by kamaluddin et al highlighted the advantage of dual layer spinneret by ensuring nanofillers were concentrated on the surface of dlhfm to enhance its potential in improving flux and rejection 23 these findings demonstrated the potential of dlhfm to mitigate the limitation faced by using single layered uf and nf membranes in this work the development of dlhfm for the remediation of at pome was done titania nanotube boron tnt b nanotubes were incorporated into the outer layer of membrane tubular nanomaterials have been evidenced to show higher surface area than their spherical counterpart tnt has abundant surface hydroxyl functional groups to facilitate water permeability across the membrane 24 the incorporation of boron into the structure of tnt has the potential to improve nanotube surface negativity which helps to improve the dispersion of nanotube across the membrane matrix 25 the spinning conditions including bore fluid flow rate bffr outer layer dope solution flow rate dsfr air gap ag and nanofiller loading were optimized as of our knowledge there is no work conducted specifically on the optimisation of key spinning parameters on membrane characteristics and filtration performance of dlhfm in current literature stage by stage optimisation via experimentation was chosen over response surface methodology rsm because the range of parameters tested was small which favours experimental optimisation over rsm 2 methodology 2 1 materials pvdf kynar 760 pellets arkema inc usa polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp mw 40 kda sigma aldrich and n methyl 2 pyrrolidone nmp across chemicals were used as polymer host pore former and solvent respectively tio2 p25 degussa evonik sodium hydroxide hydrochloric acid and boric acid sigma aldrich were used for the preparation of tnt b nanotubes bovine serum albumin bsa lignin and tannic acid ta were also procured from sigma aldrich and used for preparation of 100 ppm of bsa 1000 ppm of lignin and 1000 ppm of ta ultrapure water was used for synthesis and washing purpose while reverse osmosis ro water was used for preparation of testing solutions all chemicals and materials were used as received without prior modification or purification 2 2 preparation and characterisation of tnt b nanotubes tnt b nanotubes were prepared by a dual step hydrothermal technique the procedure has been discussed in detail elsewhere 26 firstly 3 g of tio2 p25 degussa was dispersed in 120 ml of 10 m naoh for 3 h the solution was then transferred into a teflon lined autoclave and treated for 24 h at a temperature of 180 c the treated sample was then washed with 1 m hcl solution followed by ro water wash air dry and ground the ground tnt were then treated with 0 5 m of h3bo3 for 3 h followed with hydrothermal treatment for 6 h at 120 c the treated samples were again washed with ro water air dried and ground into particles using agate mortar the prepared nanotubes were characterised using various equipment such as transmission electron microscopy tem ht 7700 hitachi x ray diffraction xrd d500 siemens brunauer emmett teller surface area thermo scientific surfer zetasizer malvern zetasizer nano zsp to study its morphology crystallinity surface area surface charge and average particle size respectively 2 3 fabrication and characterisation of pvdf tnt b dlhfm 2 3 1 dope solution preparation the dope solutions were prepared via blending technique the pre determined amount of tnt b nanotubes were added into nmp and sonicated using a probe sonicator for 10 m to ensure well dispersion of nanomaterial then pvp was added into the solvent and stirred using a magnetic stirrer until complete dissolution was achieved next pvdf pellets were added into the solvent and stirred using a mechanical stirrer at a temperature of 60 c until a homogeneous solution was obtained the solution was then sonicated for degassing purpose before spinning was commenced the dope solution composition for inner layer was standardised for all dlhfm 18 pvdf 5 pvp 77 nmp while the outer layer dope solution consists of 15 pvdf 1 pvp 84 nmp a high pore former loading for inner layer dope solution 5 wt was chosen to obtain porous and asymmetrical finger like structure mansur et al 2018 a lower pore former loading 1 wt was chosen for outer layer dope solution to produce a denser structure which would enhance membrane rejection capabilities 27 for optimisation of nanofiller loading the loading was varied at 1 wt 2 wt and 3 wt a single layer mixed matrix membrane mmm where the nanofiller was dispersed evenly in the membrane dope solution was also prepared for comparison purpose the formulation of the mmm was 18 pvdf 1 pvp 80 nmp and 1 tnt b 2 3 2 dry wet spinning ro water was used as bore fluid while tap water was used as eternal coagulant to form the hollow fiber membranes the spinning process was conducted in an ambient temperature of 25 c the hollow fiber membranes were spun using a triple orifice annular spinneret with an outer diameter of 1 2 mm middle diameter of 0 8 mm and internal diameter 0 4 mm the spinnerets were centered before spinning was commenced to ensure the needles are centered an electronic magnifying glass connected to a computer was used the thickness of bore fluid orifice is 0 4 mm the thickness of inner layer orifice is 0 2 mm and the thickness of outer layer orifice is 0 6 mm fig 1 shows the dimension of the annular spinneret and schematic set up of the spinning system four different spinning parameters were investigated in this study the optimisation was done in stages where the best parameter based on characterization and membrane performance in terms of permeability and rejection was used for the subsequent parameter study the optimisation was done based on the following sequence i bffr ii olfr iii ag and iv nanofiller loading the membrane uptake speed was maintained at 10 m min while the inner dope solution flow rate was maintained at 3 ml min for all membranes table 1 shows the sample denotation of tnt b pvdf dlhfm spun with different spinning parameters to evaluate the difference in membrane characteristics and performance a single layered mmm with pvdf pvp tnt b nmp formulation of 18 5 1 76 was prepared using a dual orifice spinneret post treatment was imperative to strengthen and cover any defect on membrane surface during fabrication and handling process the fabricated membranes were immersed in tap water for 24 h to ensure all the solvent was removed from the fabricated membranes the immersion water was changed every 8 h with fresh tap water next the membranes were treated with 10 glycerol solution for 24 h to enhance membrane structure and integrity 28 finally the membranes were left to be dried in a dryer at 60 c dried for 48 h 2 4 membrane characterisation throughout this study the membrane surface and cross section samples were examined using a hitachi tm3000 tabletop scanning electron microscope sem energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx was employed to identify the presence of elements such as ti and b on the structure of hollow fiber membranes which are the elements present in the nanofiller edx was conducted using a using a zeiss supra 35 v p field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem carl zeiss inc usa the porosity of the membranes was calculated using eq 1 10 1 ε w 0 w 1 v 100 where ε is the membrane porosity w 0 and w 1 is the weight of wet and dry membrane in grams and v is the membrane volume in cm3 water uptake analysis was also conducted the hydrophilic hydrophobic property of the membranes was characterized based of contact angle measurements using a contact angle goniometer oca20 dataphysics germany static contact angles of the membrane surface were measured using sessile drop method membrane surface roughness and topology studies were conducted using a afm model park xe 100 afm park systems california usa scanning was done for 2 different samples via contact mode where the sample size was set at 1cm 1cm finally atr ftir spectra of membrane incorporated with nanofiller was recorded using a thermo nicolet 5700 atr ftir spectroscopy which was supplied by thermo nicolet corporation and spectra tech usa using an attenuated total reflection atr sample holder 2 5 membrane filtration studies the membrane pure water flux bovine serum albumin bsa rejection synthetic at pome flux and rejection via uf was examined using a cross flow uf filtration system for each membrane sample a module consisting of 5 hollow fibers of 10 cm length was prepared and tested at pressure of 1 bar the schematics of the uf filtration system is provided in supplementary file s1 prior to any testing the membranes were pre compacted at 2 bar for 30 min to achieve steady state flux the pure water flux pwf j w l m2h was then calculated using eq 2 10 2 j w v a δ t where v is the volume of the permeate collected l a is the membrane effective area m2 and δ t is the permeation time h bsa lignin and tannic acid ta were prepared at 1000 ppm each for testing purpose in this study a hach dr5000 uv vis spectrophotometer was used to detect the intensity of permeate after membrane filtration bsa lignin ta membrane rejection r was calculated using eq 3 10 3 r r 0 r t r 0 100 where r 0 is the initial concentration of solution and r t is the concentration of solution collected from permeate end during membrane filtration 3 results and discussions 3 1 characterisation of tnt b nanotubes fig 2 shows the tem micrograph at 300k magnification xrd diffraction pattern ftir spectra of tnt b the tem micrographs in fig 2 a indicates the formation of tubular structured tio2 obtained from hydrothermal treatment of tio2 precursor in addition the nanotubes exhibited open ended structure which is in line with previous study 29 the formation of open ended structure would allow access towards the inner lumen of nanotubes and further enhance the effective surface area this would assist in exposing the hydroxyl functional group present on particle surface improving its interaction with water molecules during membrane separation the 10 50 nm diameter range of nanotubes formed is also in line with the previous work 30 31 the tem images reveal the formation of almost distinct and randomly oriented nanotubes the formation of microcrystalline structure on the surface of tnt indicates the attachment of boron nanoparticle on the surface of tnt referring to fig 2 b the peaks were identified based on the reference found in the joint committee on powder diffraction standards jcpds database the xrd peaks located at the xrd spectra shows that there are changes in the diffraction peak intensities at 25 3 1 0 1 37 7 0 0 4 48 4 2 0 0 and 54 0 2 1 1 these peaks correspond to the anatase phase plane jcpds 21 1272 on the other hand the peaks at 26 9 1 1 0 and 34 4 1 0 1 corresponds to the rutile phase plans jcpds 21 1276 respectively 32 the spectra revealed that the incorporation of boron into the structure of tnt does not bring about major changes in terms of crystallinity this emphasises the successful incorporation of boron into the structure without compromising particle crystallinity in fig 2 c the band observed between 3000 to 3700 cm 1 is attributed to the stretching of hydroxyl groups the peak at 1600 cm 1 is attributed to the bending vibration of water molecules adsorbed on the surface of the nanomaterial bezerra et al observed that the oh stretching vibration band became broader possibly due to the larger amount of water adsorbed onto the tnt surface after doping 33 similar phenomena were observed in this work as shown in the ftir spectra in fig 2 c additionally the peak intensity at 1635 cm 1 which corresponded to the carboxyl functional group increased indicating that the incorporation of semiconducting materials such as boron may induce defects and introduce oxygen vacancies on the tnt structure these vacancies can be occupied by water producing adsorbed hydroxyl functional group 34 35 the peak at 469 cm 1 for the stretching of tio bond present in all samples the absence of adsorption peaks which correspond to pure b2o3 1202 cm 1 and bo4 1096 cm 1 implied that boron atom has been incorporated in the lattice structure 36 table 2 shows the surface area average crystallinity size surface charge average pore size and nanotube diameter of the prepared tnt b nanofillers based on the results shown in table 2 tnt b exhibited a higher surface area of 159 552 m2 g which is almost 400 increment as compared to the tio2 precursor 25 37 the tubular structure formation via hydrothermal method renders higher exposed surface area which greatly increased the particle surface area 38 furthermore the successful incorporation of boron into the lattice structure contributed to its high surface negativity as seen in the data demonstrated in table 2 the surface charge of tnt b 11 767 0 058 mv is twice of bare tnt 6 717 mv boron is known to be more electronegative than titanium based on the pauling scale 39 hence the doping of boron on the surface of tnt increased its surface electronegativity these data show that tnt b has the potential to be an adequate nanofiller to improve polymeric membranes characteristics for better rejection and permeation performance 3 2 characterisation of dlhfm 3 2 1 effect of different bffr the first parameter investigated was the bffr ro water was used as bore fluid the bffr was selected based on the ratio between dsfr and bffr of 3 1 3 1 5 and 1 1 fig 3 shows the surface micrographs and cross section morphology of dlhfm prepared at different bffr while table 3 shows the lumen size thickness inner finger like structure length diameter outer layer finger like thickness length of mmm and all dlhfm prepared in this study based on the sem micrographs shown in fig 3 both pvdf bffr1 and pvdf bffr1 5 did not show significant changes in membrane lumen size as both membranes recorded a lumen size of 425 12 μm and 433 8 μm respectively however the lumen size of pvdf bffr3 was significantly increased to 635 11 μm all membranes exhibited a three layered structure which consists of finger like structure in the inner layer a dense structure in the middle and a thinner finger like structure underneath the selective layer on the outer layer of membrane these three layered structures were formed from the concurrent extrusion of two dope solution this structure is known as the sandwich like structure which is due to the suspension coagulation instability during phase inversion process since 5 wt of pore former has been added in the inner layer a porous inner membrane structure was obtained song et al also observed the increase in membrane porosity when polyethylene glycol peg was used as pore forming agent 40 the inner layer exhibited longer finger like structure compared to the outer layer due to the difference in pore former loading as inner layer dope solution was added with 5 wt of pvp whist outer layer dope solution was only added with 1 wt of pvp the lower bffr also inhibited the phase inversion process as indicated by the membrane wall thickness the wall thickness of pvdf bffr1 pvdf bffr1 5 pvdf bffr3 measured from the sem images was 715 17 μm 735 12 μm and 685 13 μm respectively when the bffr was increased the demixing of internal coagulant with solvent of polymer solution was accelerated followed by domain growth that reached the point of solidification the faster phase inversion promoted the formation of longer finger like structure as exhibited in fig 3 c2 on the other hand slower phase inversion process for pvdf bffr1 and pvdf bffr1 5 due to lower bffr promoted the formation of larger dense layer in the middle of the membrane higher bffr resulted in complete polymer precipitation as the non solvent penetrated from the lumen side into the membrane matrix which led to higher precipitation rate 41 compared to mmm all dlhfm exhibited smaller membrane lumen due to the presence of two different dope solution which flowed concurrently additionally mmm membranes exhibited longer inner layer finger like structure the flow rate of mmm membrane was 3 ml min while the flowrate of dlhfm was 6 ml min combining inner and outer dsfr theoretically more dope solution would be flowing though the spinneret during the spinning of dlhfm as compared to that of mmm the lower flow rate of mmm would allow faster demixing which would be the reason why longer inner layer finger like structure was observed for mmm as compared to dlhfm the surface roughness of the membranes fabricated with different bffr was analysed through afm fig 4 shows the 3d afm surface images and surface roughness ra values of pvdf bffr1 pvdf bffr1 5 pvdf bffr3 and mmm in these images the brightest area represents the highest point of membrane surface and the dark regions indicate valley or membrane pores the 3d afm images of all membranes exhibited the formation of nodule like structure which aggregated on the outer surface table 4 shows the 3d surface roughness values of mmm and all dlhfm prepared in this study pvdf bffr3 exhibited the lowest rq and the roughness parameter was similar to that of mmm the membrane surface roughness increased when bffr was increased from 1 ml min and 1 5 ml min with low bffr the occurrence of phase inversion within the membrane lumen was also hampered hence leading to delayed liquid liquid demixing when the nascent membrane entered the coagulation bath phase inversion via the membrane outer surface took place at a much higher rate resulted in the leaching of pore former from inner layer and outer layer dope solution through the membrane surface this phenomenon increased the membrane surface roughness with the formation of conglomerated nodules on the other hand this phenomenon was averted for membrane pvdf bffr3 since the flowrate ratio between inner layer dope solution and bore fluid are the same 3 ml min phase inversion occurred at a higher rate though the inner layer compared to the outer layer this reduced the leaching of pore former through the membrane surface which led to lower membrane surface roughness 41 due to the controlled distribution of tnt b0 5 in the outer layer instead of randomly distributed throughout the polymer matrix the hydrophilic nanofiller could more significantly alter the membrane surface porosity and hydrophilicity table 5 shows the water uptake porosity and contact angle of mmm and all dlhfm prepared in this study table 5 shows the water uptake porosity and contact angle of the membranes spun using different bffr hydrophilic nanofillers have been favourably incorporated to improve the hydrophilicity of hydrophobic polymers such as pvdf mmm membrane exhibited a contact angle of 73 83 the distribution of the nanofillers within polymer matrix of the outer layer has significantly reduced the contact angle particularly for pvdf bffr3 which exhibited the lowest contact angle of 64 44 as more hydrophilic nanomaterials were distribution within the outer layer of membrane the water uptake volume was similar for all membranes implying that spinning parameter does not influence water uptake for membrane porosity mmm exhibited the highest membrane porosity while increase in bffr led to higher membrane porosity higher bffr accelerated the solvent nonsolvent demixing thus promoted the formation of finger like structures and macrovoid and improved the membrane porosity 42 the influence of bffr towards the permeation and rejection of dlhfm using pure water bsa lignin and ta as model solutions was investigated it was noticed that the bffr greatly affected the membrane permeability and rejection capabilities this spinning parameter directly affected the thickness of the dlhfm fig 5 a shows the flux of pure water bsa lignin and ta and b the rejection performance for bsa 67 kda lignin 127 kda and ta 17 kda a molecular weight cut off mwco graph was also plotted and added in the supplementary file as s2 due to the thinner membrane structure mmm with single layer exhibited higher permeation compared to that of pvdf bffr1 and pvdf bffr1 5 the reduced resistance for liquid transport across the membrane wall has enhanced the water permeability however it was observed that pvdf bffr3 exhibited higher flux for all solutions tested as compared to mmm the smaller wall thickness due to faster phase inversion process improved membrane transport properties additionally the higher surface hydrophilicity due to the immobilisation of nanofiller on membrane outer layer enhanced the flux 43 the removal exhibited by the membranes are solely via sieving mechanism the development of the dlhfm was to ensure the deposition of nanofillers are concentrated solely on the membrane surface this would improve water transport across membrane and improve rejection as seen in the results shown in this work all dlhfm exhibited higher rejection for all tested solute as compared to mmm owing to the increased transport resistance across the membrane low bffr slowed down phase inversion process hence producing a thicker membrane layer however faster bffr would enhance the movement of solvent across dope solution and out of polymer matrix this would produce a membrane with long and intrinsic asymmetrical structure due to the simultaneous movement of pore formers out of membrane matrix and continuous coagulation of polymer in membrane matrix dlhfm exhibited a dense structure in the middle of the membrane which is absent in mmm fig 2 d3 the presence of a dense layer in between the asymmetrical structures can improve membrane rejection as all dlhfm exhibited greater rejection of all tested solutes compared to mmm the optimization of bffr showed that pvdf bffr3 exhibited the highest flux and rejection hence the bore fluid of 3 ml min was fixed for the optimisation of olfr 3 2 2 effect of different olfr the manipulation of olfr is important to understand the effect of different outer dsfr on the thickness of the membrane outer layer this is paramount as the selective layer would govern the permeation and rejection of the dlhfm prepared a minimum ratio between olfr and inner layer flow rate ilfr of 1 1 was set due to the configuration of spinneret fig 6 shows the surface and cross section morphology of pvdf olfr3 pvdf olfr4 5 and pvdf olfr6 based on cross sectional morphology the higher olfr has increased the thickness of the membrane outer layer as shown in fig 6 a2 c2 all the dlhfm exhibited three distinct layers where there is the outermost layer the interface layer between outer layer dope solution and inner layer dope solution and the inner layer this observation is similar with the membranes that were spun at different bffr as shown in fig 6 both inner and outer layer shows a narrow finger like structure while the interfacial layer shows a porous macrovoid structure however the finger like structure of outer layer elongated with the increase of olfr additionally no evidence of delamination was observed in the cross section micrographs which is in good agreement with previous research work done delamination was not observed as the same polymers were used for both outer and inner layer hence good compatibility was achieved between the outer and inner layers with the polymer content of 15 wt and 18 wt used for the outer and inner layer the outer layer experienced greater shrinkage rate as compared to inner layer during phase inversion process as a result the inner layer was tightly wrapped by the outer layer similar structure of dlhfm has been reported by dzinun et al who fabricated dlhfm with pvdf as polymers 44 the lower viscosity of the outer layer dope solution due to low polymer loading could have been compensated with the addition of nanofiller which increased the dope viscosity all dlhfm exhibited similar surface structure with evidence of tubular looking rods attached on it indicating the presence of tnt b nanotubes with increased olfr the middle layer exhibited higher thickness due to larger volume of dope solution provision during phase inversion process as seen in fig 6 a2 b2 c2 fig 7 shows the 3d afm images of all membranes prepared at different olfr it can be noticed that the membrane surface roughness reduced with the increasing olfr pvdf olfr6 exhibited the lowest surface roughness of 26 82 9 28 nm and lowest rz at 149 17 55 42 nm when the dope solution is extruded at a higher rate the polymer molecular chains tend to align themselves better the enhancement of molecular orientation causes the polymer molecules to pack closer to each other which leads to a tighter structure hence further reducing membrane surface roughness 45 as tabulated in table 5 the water contact angle increased with increasing olfr on the other hand lower water uptake and membrane porosity were observed when the olfr was increased from 3 ml min to 6 ml min it was expected that with higher olfr the hydrophilicity would be improved as more nanofiller was incorporated into the membrane outer layer however this phenomenon has been offset by the hydrophobicity of polymer these results were reflected by the lower water uptake value with higher olfr and lower porosity fig 8 shows the flux and rejection performance for bsa lignin and ta for membranes prepared at different olfr a molecular weight cut off mwco graph was also plotted and added in the supplementary file as s2 the increment of olfr reduced the membrane thickness as observed in table 3 all dual layer membranes exhibited higher flux for all solute tested as compared to mmm which again highlights the advantage of dual layer membrane configuration referring to fig 8 a when the olfr was increased from 3 ml min to 4 5 ml min and 6 ml min there was a small drop of flux for all solutes tested with the highest flux values for pure water bsa lignin and ta at 106 07 l m2h 107 48 l m2h 40 31 l m2h and 29 70 l m2h respectively was recorded by pvdf olfr3 the drop in flux may be due to the increased membrane transport resistance with higher olfr the increased olfr produced a thicker middle layer as observed in fig 6 a2 b2 c2 due to larger volume of dope solution experiencing mutual diffusion with inner layer dope solution gradual improvement in membrane rejection capabilities was observed when the olfr was increased in which membrane pvdf olfr6 exhibited the highest rejection for bsa lignin and ta at 98 49 98 86 and 71 96 respectively while membrane pvdf olfr3 recorded similar rejection of 98 01 98 40 and 68 91 for bsa lignin and ta respectively the results showed that manipulation of olfr of dlhfm could enhance flux but insignificant in improving membrane rejection properties a higher olfr promoted a thicker intermediate layer between both inner and outer finger like structure as observed in fig 6 this played a role in increasing membrane transport resistance and hindered membrane permeation however it did not improve membrane rejection properties based on the results it was concluded that membranes spun with olfr of 3 ml min was the best due to slightly enhanced flux while maintaining its rejection performance 3 2 3 effect of different ag fig 9 shows the changes in membrane surface and cross section morphology under tem analysis when ag was manipulated as 5 10 and 15 cm all membrane surface exhibited similar morphology at different ag values as seen in fig 9 a1 b1 c1 indicating the manipulation of ag does not lead to significant changes in membrane surface structure however noticeable changes have been observed in membrane cross section morphology the membrane diameter decreased with the increasing ag as the membrane was exposed to longer period of gravitational pull which in turn increased the elongation force exerted on the fibers exiting the spinneret this phenomenon reduced the thickness of the membranes a similar phenomenon was observed by said et al when ag was manipulated between 3 cm to 50 cm for the preparation of psf hollow fiber membrane 46 however since the travel time for nascent membrane from spinneret to outer coagulant bath was increased with higher ag the outer layer finger like structure length was reduced fig 10 shows the 3d afm images of dlhfm prepared at different ag when the ag was increased the number of needle like nodules becomes larger with reduced difference between peak and valley this phenomenon would decrease the membrane surface roughness at higher ag the polymeric molecular chain tends to align themselves much better than that of lower ag the enhanced orientation resulted in the closer packing of polymer molecules to form tighter structure 47 additionally at higher ag the travel time between spinneret to external coagulant bath was increased this promoted the formation of thin selective layer on the membrane surface due to the evaporation of solvent from dope solution into the environment both phenomena have led to smoother membrane surface as observed in in fig 10 a b and c when the ag was increased the membrane thickness showed a reducing trend as seen in table 5 past study has shown that membranes with smaller wall thickness can contribute towards higher hydrophilicity 48 sem images elucidated in fig 9 show a reduction in membrane wall thickness for membranes spun at higher ag which translated to higher hydrophilicity the membrane water uptake was also increased which is in tandem with lower contact angle the ag between spinneret and coagulation bath is important as it governs the membrane surface properties and eventual rejection performance since two dope solutions are extruded simultaneously the effect of ag towards the membrane performance may vary as compared to single layered hollow fiber membrane fig 11 shows the flux and rejection performance of dlhfm prepared at different ag on the permeation and rejection of bsa lignin and ta a molecular weight cut off mwco graph was also plotted and added in the supplementary file as s2 as observed in fig 11 a the flux of membranes shows a reducing trend when ag was increased from 5 cm to 15 cm pvdf ag5 exhibited the highest flux among all membranes tested the flux values of pvdf ag5 for pure water bsa lignin and ta is 107 48 l m2h 108 88 l m2h 40 31 l m2h and 29 35 l m2h respectively when ag increased the travel time of nascent membrane from spinneret to coagulation bath increases this phenomenon would allow greater time for solvent to diffuse through air forming a thin layer on membrane surface before it reaches the coagulation bath to complete the phase inversion process longer travel time would create a denser thin layer on the membrane surface which would hinder membrane permeation however this would improve membrane rejection performance as evidenced in fig 11 b membrane pvdf ag10 exhibited the best rejection performance for all tested solute with rejection of 99 86 99 04 and 76 46 of bsa lignin and ta respectively the increase in rejection can be attributed to the denser thin layer formed on membrane surface however membrane pvdf ag15 exhibited a slight drop in rejection performance rejecting 96 71 of bsa 68 63 of lignin and 64 11 of ta as the coagulated dope solution was passing through the ag region the larger mass of the fiber at longer ag could induce an increase in extrusion rate this phenomenon resulted in membrane stretching which consequently led to defects that compromise membrane rejection performance 49 based on the results obtained in this section it can be concluded that an ag of 10 cm is the best in terms of producing dlhfm with high flux and rejection capabilities hence for the following optimisation an ag of 10 cm was used for the optimization of nanofiller loading 3 2 4 effect of different nanofiller loading fig 12 shows the changes in membrane surface and cross section morphology when the loading of nanofiller in outer layer dope solution was varied to 1 wt 2 wt and 3 wt all the dlhfm exhibited asymmetrical finger like structure on both outer and inner part of the membranes these membranes also exhibited a three layered structure the middle structure for pvdf l1 shows a sponge like structure while both pvdf l2 and pvdf l3 shows a porous macrovoid structure in place of the sponge like structure sponge like structures are commonly associated to slower phase inversion process additionally no signs of delamination were observed between both layers even at 3 wt nanofiller loading which shows great compatibility between both dope solutions when the nanofiller loading was increased there was an increment in the length of finger like structure on the outer layer of membrane it was also observed that the dense interlayer started to diminish with increase in nanofiller loading due to the hydrophilicity of tnt b incorporated in the outer layer large amount of water was attracted towards the membranes during phase inversion hence increases the rate of phase inversion dzinun et al 2015 with the increasing hydrophilicity of the dope solution upon the addition of more tnt b it was observed that the finger like length increased as reflected in table 3 fig 13 shows the cross section edx mapping of mmm and pvdf l1 fig 13 shows the edx mapping of both said membranes which confirmed the distribution of tnt b on the membrane outer layer it was observed that the even distribution of tnt b0 5 across the membrane matrix for mmm while the nanofiller could mainly be observed in the outer layer of dlhfm a small amount of tnt b0 5 also presented in the inner layer of pvdf l1 which suggested the diffusion of outer dope solution towards inner dope solution phase inversion took place on the inner part of membrane once bore fluid was introduced during the spinning and completed when the membrane entered the external coagulant bath upon exiting the spinneret the mixing of the highly miscible polymer dopes of inner and outer layer could possibly take place this explains the presence of nanomaterials which are initially absent in the inner layer dope solution however the edx mapping shows that the large portion of tnt b0 5 was concentrated on the membrane outer layer which confirms the fact that single step dual layer spinning allows controlled distribution of nanomaterials fig 14 shows the 3d afm surface images of all dlhfm prepared at different nanofiller loading on outer layer the addition of nanomaterials into polymeric dope solution increased the dope viscosity hence delaying phase inversion process 43 additionally the presence of needle like tnt on the outer layer dope solution can also influence membrane surface roughness by promoting the development of ridge and valley structure on the membrane surface 50 based on fig 14 a b and c all membrane surface exhibited nodular like needles while data in table 4 showed an increase in surface roughness when nanofiller loading was increased from 1 wt 34 88 4 78 nm to 2 wt 41 51 9 10 nm ong et al reported a surface roughness of 10 4 nm when 1 wt of tio2 was added in dope solution while mmm in this current work reported a surface roughness of 36 74 4 66 nm 51 pvdf l3 with contact angle of 58 03 exhibited the highest surface hydrophilicity among the membranes dzinun et al reported the increase in surface hydrophilicity with the increasing tio2 loading 52 the increased concentration of in hydrophilic nanomaterial on membrane surface contributed to lower contact angle value the membranes also exhibited higher porosity with the increased nanofiller loading fig 15 shows the flux and rejection performance of dlhfm prepared at different nanofiller loading on the permeation and rejection of bsa lignin and ta a molecular weight cut off mwco graph was also plotted and added in the supplementary file as s2 it can be observed in fig 15 that all dlhfm exhibited higher flux for all solute tested as compared to mmm particularly membrane pvdf l3 exhibited the highest flux for pure water bsa lignin and ta at 106 07 l m2h 136 28 l m2h 43 49 l m2h and 33 24 l m2h respectively pvdf l3 also exhibited the highest flux among all dlhfm prepared in this study the increased loading of nanomaterial in membrane structure played an important role in this improvement as discussed in section 3 1 0 tnt b exhibited good hydrophilicity due to the presence of hydroxyl functional groups which is necessary to attract water across membrane the improvement in membrane hydrophilicity with increased loading was also observed the enhancement in membrane hydrophilicity improved the absorption of water molecules within the membrane surface which in turn enhanced the water permeation through membrane however the high flux exhibited may also due to the defects formation resulted from tnt b0 5 agglomeration 43 previous research has shown that when nanomaterial loading is very high agglomeration of nanomaterial will occur and this would lead to formation of defected membrane that enhances flux but compromises membrane rejection properties 53 54 however there was no clear trend in flux values with increment of tnt b0 5 loading with pvdf l2 exhibiting lower flux values compared to pvdf l1 and pvdf l3 for all solutions tested the reduction of flux exhibited by pvdf l2 may be due to the slower demixing of solvent nonsolvent during phase inversion process it is a well established fact that greater loading of nanomaterial is known to increase dope solution viscosity which in turns delay the phase inversion process 55 this may lead to the formation of denser membranes which reduced flux but improved membrane rejection capabilities in terms of rejection all dlhfm exhibited improved rejection performance as compared to mmm with pvdf l2 exhibiting the best rejection for bsa lignin and ta at 99 12 99 06 and 78 51 respectively on the other hand pvdf l3 exhibited the worst rejection performance for bsa lignin and ta at 96 15 97 68 and 55 67 respectively this correlates to the increment in flux exhibited by pvdf l3 compared to pvdf l2 at higher nanomaterial loading above threshold value the agglomeration of nanomaterials in the membrane matrix may lead to formation of large voids this would enhance flux but compromise rejection the flux and rejection data showed that the optimum loading of tnt b0 5 into outer layer of dlhfm is 2 wt the denser selective layer exhibited by pvdf l2 was able to improve rejection the results indicated that pvdf l2 is the best candidate for the treatment of at pome 4 conclusion a pvdf based dlhfm incorporated with tnt b in their outer layer were successfully developed using a triple orifice spinneret various characterisations showed the formation of tubular structure deposited with boron high crystallinity and a large surface area with abundant surface hydroxyl functional group these results showed that tnt b is a good nanofiller as it resulted in improved rejection and permeation dlhfm membranes of various spinning parameters including single layered mmm different bffr different olfr different ag and different nanofiller loading were fabricated to understand the effect of each key parameters towards membrane morphology surface roughness hydrophilicity permeation and rejection of various solutions including pure water and bsa lignin and ta were also used as model solutions mimicking at pome the development of dlhfm suggested that a bffr of 3 ml min olfr of 3 ml min ag of 10 cm and nanofiller loading of 2 wt is the best in developing a dlhfm which can retain high flux while exhibiting high rejection of both lignin flux 37 48 l m2h rejection 99 06 and ta flux 25 46 l m2h rejection 78 51 model solutes of at pome the formation of finger like asymmetrical structure on the inner layer of membrane and dense layer in the middle and a thin selective

14030,dual layer hollow fiber membrane dlhfm offers the flexibility to independently tailor the outer and inner surface of hollow fiber membrane in a single step the optimization of key spinning parameters is crucial to attain the desired membrane properties to suit its application in this study polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf dlhfm incorporated with titania nanotube boron tnt b in the outer layer was developed via dry wet spinning using a triple orifice spinneret as synthesized tnt b served as a promising nanofiller to improve the hydrophilicity flux and rejection of dlhfm bore fluid flow rate bffr outer layer dope solution flow rate olfr air gap ag and nanofiller loading during the dlhf spinning were optimized through experimental approach the resultant membranes exhibited triple layered sandwich structure with a dense interlayer in the middle between a long finger like asymmetrical structure in its inner layer and a thinner finger like structure underneath the selective layer on the outer layer of membrane the separation performances for bovine serum albumin bsa lignin and tannic acid ta of prepared membranes were evaluated dlhfm spun with bffr of 3 ml min olfr of 3 ml min ag of 10 cm and nanofiller loading of 2 wt exhibited the optimal performance by achieving pure water bsa lignin and ta flux of 97 65 l m2h 106 78 l m2h 37 48 l m2h 25 46 l m2h and rejection of 99 12 99 06 and 78 51 respectively keywords dual layer hollow fiber membrane at pome ultrafiltration colour removal 1 introduction the rapid development of membrane technology is attributed to its wide acceptance in a huge array of industries which require efficient separation techniques at low cost and low energy consumption 1 membrane based separation processes have been applied to treat wastewater and effluents from various sectors such as petrochemical electronics and agriculture in malaysia the discharge of agricultural waste has posed significant risk to the water source and environment 2 as the second largest palm oil producers in the world large quantity of palm oil mill effluent pome has also been produced in malaysia it is estimated that in average a total of 53 million m3 of pome is produced in malaysia 3 palm oil extraction process is a water intensive process in which it is estimated that every tonne of palm oil produces 7 tonnes of pome 4 pome is highly greasy effluent filled with organic matter and with high chemical oxygen demand cod 30 000 60 000 mg l and biochemical oxygen demand bod 10 000 25 000 mg l levels 5 prior to its discharge pome is commonly treated using conventional method such as aerobic and anaerobic digestion in multiple ponds for 20 60 days the final effluent produced is known as aerobically treated palm oil mill effluent at pome which is characterised by its brownish coloration due to the presence of lignocellulosic matters such as lignin and tannins 6 even though this effluent passes the stringent discharge requirements the presence of pigments poses negative impacts towards the receiving water bodies 7 studies have shown that natural water bodies that are contaminated with pigments may undergo eutrophication and lead to the systemic collapse of local aquatic systems 8 additionally the intrusion of pigments into natural water bodies may render water unusable for domestic purposes membrane filtration is a viable alternative to provide a tertiary polishing step to remove pigments present in at pome to mitigate any harmful outcome towards receiving water bodies both nanofiltration nf and ultrafiltration uf membranes have been used for the removal of pigments at varying degrees of success amat et al treated at pome using conventional nf flat sheet membranes where a removal of 99 69 was achieved at a pressure of 10 bar 9 subramaniam et al prepared tnt pvdf based hollow fiber uf membranes and reported colour removal of 58 9 10 it has been generally observed that nf suffers from severe fouling despite the promising removal efficiency whereas uf membranes cannot sufficiently remove the colour pigments a new class of membranes known as mixed matrix membranes mmm has been introduced to mitigate the limitation of conventional membranes in mmm nanomaterials which endowed with exceptional physico chemical properties such as high surface area and highly hydrophilic are dispersed across the membrane matrix the field of membrane technology experienced a significant breakthrough when it was evident that the addition of such nanomaterials can impart specific characteristics which can play a role in improving membrane performance in the past decade the incorporation of nanomaterials such as graphene 11 graphene oxide go 12 titania based nanomaterials 10 13 silica 14 and metal organic frameworks mof 15 16 have brought about improved productivity and rejection capability currently researchers have shifted their attention on developing hybrid nanomaterials which can impart multiple unique characteristics on the resultant mmm for example arumugham et al prepared a nano cuo g c3n4 g cn sheets which was incorporated into a polyphenylsulfone ppsu membrane for protein removal from water 17 the embedded nanomaterial did not only increase the membrane permeation and rejection capabilities but also imparted antifouling properties similarly wang et al developed a thin film nanocomposite membrane embedded with two dimensional mxene ti3c2tx for desalination purpose 18 the incorporation of this unique nanofiller brought about several distinct improvement on membrane performance including antifouling chlorine resistance and improved flux such improvements are directly linked to the properties of the nanomaterials however one common problem faced by mmm is the uneven and uncontrollable distribution of the nanomaterials across the membrane structure this condition is detrimental to nanocomposite membranes which require specific surface characteristics such as antifouling and antibacterial as the nanoparticles that are embedded deep in membrane matrix may be rendered useless or less effectiveness recent development on the configuration of annular spinnerets has opened to the possibility of fabricating dual layer hollow fiber membranes dlhfm where membranes are prepared using two distinct dope solutions to obtain membranes with inner and outer layers with tailored properties for specific applications 19 this also allows a higher degree of control on nanomaterial dispersion where it can be concentrated on membrane outer layer during the spinning process sun et al developed a polyamide imide cellulose acetate dlhfm for the nanofiltration of divalent and monovalent anions for desalination purposes 20 the spinneret design allowed the formation of dense inner layer while forming a less defective but thicker dense selective skin similarly setiawan et al developed a nf dlhfm using poly amide imide pai as the selective layer and polyether sulfone psf as the inner support layer for water softening purpose 21 the pai coating was able to increase the hydrophilicity and improved rejection of salts 22 another work conducted by kamaluddin et al highlighted the advantage of dual layer spinneret by ensuring nanofillers were concentrated on the surface of dlhfm to enhance its potential in improving flux and rejection 23 these findings demonstrated the potential of dlhfm to mitigate the limitation faced by using single layered uf and nf membranes in this work the development of dlhfm for the remediation of at pome was done titania nanotube boron tnt b nanotubes were incorporated into the outer layer of membrane tubular nanomaterials have been evidenced to show higher surface area than their spherical counterpart tnt has abundant surface hydroxyl functional groups to facilitate water permeability across the membrane 24 the incorporation of boron into the structure of tnt has the potential to improve nanotube surface negativity which helps to improve the dispersion of nanotube across the membrane matrix 25 the spinning conditions including bore fluid flow rate bffr outer layer dope solution flow rate dsfr air gap ag and nanofiller loading were optimized as of our knowledge there is no work conducted specifically on the optimisation of key spinning parameters on membrane characteristics and filtration performance of dlhfm in current literature stage by stage optimisation via experimentation was chosen over response surface methodology rsm because the range of parameters tested was small which favours experimental optimisation over rsm 2 methodology 2 1 materials pvdf kynar 760 pellets arkema inc usa polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp mw 40 kda sigma aldrich and n methyl 2 pyrrolidone nmp across chemicals were used as polymer host pore former and solvent respectively tio2 p25 degussa evonik sodium hydroxide hydrochloric acid and boric acid sigma aldrich were used for the preparation of tnt b nanotubes bovine serum albumin bsa lignin and tannic acid ta were also procured from sigma aldrich and used for preparation of 100 ppm of bsa 1000 ppm of lignin and 1000 ppm of ta ultrapure water was used for synthesis and washing purpose while reverse osmosis ro water was used for preparation of testing solutions all chemicals and materials were used as received without prior modification or purification 2 2 preparation and characterisation of tnt b nanotubes tnt b nanotubes were prepared by a dual step hydrothermal technique the procedure has been discussed in detail elsewhere 26 firstly 3 g of tio2 p25 degussa was dispersed in 120 ml of 10 m naoh for 3 h the solution was then transferred into a teflon lined autoclave and treated for 24 h at a temperature of 180 c the treated sample was then washed with 1 m hcl solution followed by ro water wash air dry and ground the ground tnt were then treated with 0 5 m of h3bo3 for 3 h followed with hydrothermal treatment for 6 h at 120 c the treated samples were again washed with ro water air dried and ground into particles using agate mortar the prepared nanotubes were characterised using various equipment such as transmission electron microscopy tem ht 7700 hitachi x ray diffraction xrd d500 siemens brunauer emmett teller surface area thermo scientific surfer zetasizer malvern zetasizer nano zsp to study its morphology crystallinity surface area surface charge and average particle size respectively 2 3 fabrication and characterisation of pvdf tnt b dlhfm 2 3 1 dope solution preparation the dope solutions were prepared via blending technique the pre determined amount of tnt b nanotubes were added into nmp and sonicated using a probe sonicator for 10 m to ensure well dispersion of nanomaterial then pvp was added into the solvent and stirred using a magnetic stirrer until complete dissolution was achieved next pvdf pellets were added into the solvent and stirred using a mechanical stirrer at a temperature of 60 c until a homogeneous solution was obtained the solution was then sonicated for degassing purpose before spinning was commenced the dope solution composition for inner layer was standardised for all dlhfm 18 pvdf 5 pvp 77 nmp while the outer layer dope solution consists of 15 pvdf 1 pvp 84 nmp a high pore former loading for inner layer dope solution 5 wt was chosen to obtain porous and asymmetrical finger like structure mansur et al 2018 a lower pore former loading 1 wt was chosen for outer layer dope solution to produce a denser structure which would enhance membrane rejection capabilities 27 for optimisation of nanofiller loading the loading was varied at 1 wt 2 wt and 3 wt a single layer mixed matrix membrane mmm where the nanofiller was dispersed evenly in the membrane dope solution was also prepared for comparison purpose the formulation of the mmm was 18 pvdf 1 pvp 80 nmp and 1 tnt b 2 3 2 dry wet spinning ro water was used as bore fluid while tap water was used as eternal coagulant to form the hollow fiber membranes the spinning process was conducted in an ambient temperature of 25 c the hollow fiber membranes were spun using a triple orifice annular spinneret with an outer diameter of 1 2 mm middle diameter of 0 8 mm and internal diameter 0 4 mm the spinnerets were centered before spinning was commenced to ensure the needles are centered an electronic magnifying glass connected to a computer was used the thickness of bore fluid orifice is 0 4 mm the thickness of inner layer orifice is 0 2 mm and the thickness of outer layer orifice is 0 6 mm fig 1 shows the dimension of the annular spinneret and schematic set up of the spinning system four different spinning parameters were investigated in this study the optimisation was done in stages where the best parameter based on characterization and membrane performance in terms of permeability and rejection was used for the subsequent parameter study the optimisation was done based on the following sequence i bffr ii olfr iii ag and iv nanofiller loading the membrane uptake speed was maintained at 10 m min while the inner dope solution flow rate was maintained at 3 ml min for all membranes table 1 shows the sample denotation of tnt b pvdf dlhfm spun with different spinning parameters to evaluate the difference in membrane characteristics and performance a single layered mmm with pvdf pvp tnt b nmp formulation of 18 5 1 76 was prepared using a dual orifice spinneret post treatment was imperative to strengthen and cover any defect on membrane surface during fabrication and handling process the fabricated membranes were immersed in tap water for 24 h to ensure all the solvent was removed from the fabricated membranes the immersion water was changed every 8 h with fresh tap water next the membranes were treated with 10 glycerol solution for 24 h to enhance membrane structure and integrity 28 finally the membranes were left to be dried in a dryer at 60 c dried for 48 h 2 4 membrane characterisation throughout this study the membrane surface and cross section samples were examined using a hitachi tm3000 tabletop scanning electron microscope sem energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx was employed to identify the presence of elements such as ti and b on the structure of hollow fiber membranes which are the elements present in the nanofiller edx was conducted using a using a zeiss supra 35 v p field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem carl zeiss inc usa the porosity of the membranes was calculated using eq 1 10 1 ε w 0 w 1 v 100 where ε is the membrane porosity w 0 and w 1 is the weight of wet and dry membrane in grams and v is the membrane volume in cm3 water uptake analysis was also conducted the hydrophilic hydrophobic property of the membranes was characterized based of contact angle measurements using a contact angle goniometer oca20 dataphysics germany static contact angles of the membrane surface were measured using sessile drop method membrane surface roughness and topology studies were conducted using a afm model park xe 100 afm park systems california usa scanning was done for 2 different samples via contact mode where the sample size was set at 1cm 1cm finally atr ftir spectra of membrane incorporated with nanofiller was recorded using a thermo nicolet 5700 atr ftir spectroscopy which was supplied by thermo nicolet corporation and spectra tech usa using an attenuated total reflection atr sample holder 2 5 membrane filtration studies the membrane pure water flux bovine serum albumin bsa rejection synthetic at pome flux and rejection via uf was examined using a cross flow uf filtration system for each membrane sample a module consisting of 5 hollow fibers of 10 cm length was prepared and tested at pressure of 1 bar the schematics of the uf filtration system is provided in supplementary file s1 prior to any testing the membranes were pre compacted at 2 bar for 30 min to achieve steady state flux the pure water flux pwf j w l m2h was then calculated using eq 2 10 2 j w v a δ t where v is the volume of the permeate collected l a is the membrane effective area m2 and δ t is the permeation time h bsa lignin and tannic acid ta were prepared at 1000 ppm each for testing purpose in this study a hach dr5000 uv vis spectrophotometer was used to detect the intensity of permeate after membrane filtration bsa lignin ta membrane rejection r was calculated using eq 3 10 3 r r 0 r t r 0 100 where r 0 is the initial concentration of solution and r t is the concentration of solution collected from permeate end during membrane filtration 3 results and discussions 3 1 characterisation of tnt b nanotubes fig 2 shows the tem micrograph at 300k magnification xrd diffraction pattern ftir spectra of tnt b the tem micrographs in fig 2 a indicates the formation of tubular structured tio2 obtained from hydrothermal treatment of tio2 precursor in addition the nanotubes exhibited open ended structure which is in line with previous study 29 the formation of open ended structure would allow access towards the inner lumen of nanotubes and further enhance the effective surface area this would assist in exposing the hydroxyl functional group present on particle surface improving its interaction with water molecules during membrane separation the 10 50 nm diameter range of nanotubes formed is also in line with the previous work 30 31 the tem images reveal the formation of almost distinct and randomly oriented nanotubes the formation of microcrystalline structure on the surface of tnt indicates the attachment of boron nanoparticle on the surface of tnt referring to fig 2 b the peaks were identified based on the reference found in the joint committee on powder diffraction standards jcpds database the xrd peaks located at the xrd spectra shows that there are changes in the diffraction peak intensities at 25 3 1 0 1 37 7 0 0 4 48 4 2 0 0 and 54 0 2 1 1 these peaks correspond to the anatase phase plane jcpds 21 1272 on the other hand the peaks at 26 9 1 1 0 and 34 4 1 0 1 corresponds to the rutile phase plans jcpds 21 1276 respectively 32 the spectra revealed that the incorporation of boron into the structure of tnt does not bring about major changes in terms of crystallinity this emphasises the successful incorporation of boron into the structure without compromising particle crystallinity in fig 2 c the band observed between 3000 to 3700 cm 1 is attributed to the stretching of hydroxyl groups the peak at 1600 cm 1 is attributed to the bending vibration of water molecules adsorbed on the surface of the nanomaterial bezerra et al observed that the oh stretching vibration band became broader possibly due to the larger amount of water adsorbed onto the tnt surface after doping 33 similar phenomena were observed in this work as shown in the ftir spectra in fig 2 c additionally the peak intensity at 1635 cm 1 which corresponded to the carboxyl functional group increased indicating that the incorporation of semiconducting materials such as boron may induce defects and introduce oxygen vacancies on the tnt structure these vacancies can be occupied by water producing adsorbed hydroxyl functional group 34 35 the peak at 469 cm 1 for the stretching of tio bond present in all samples the absence of adsorption peaks which correspond to pure b2o3 1202 cm 1 and bo4 1096 cm 1 implied that boron atom has been incorporated in the lattice structure 36 table 2 shows the surface area average crystallinity size surface charge average pore size and nanotube diameter of the prepared tnt b nanofillers based on the results shown in table 2 tnt b exhibited a higher surface area of 159 552 m2 g which is almost 400 increment as compared to the tio2 precursor 25 37 the tubular structure formation via hydrothermal method renders higher exposed surface area which greatly increased the particle surface area 38 furthermore the successful incorporation of boron into the lattice structure contributed to its high surface negativity as seen in the data demonstrated in table 2 the surface charge of tnt b 11 767 0 058 mv is twice of bare tnt 6 717 mv boron is known to be more electronegative than titanium based on the pauling scale 39 hence the doping of boron on the surface of tnt increased its surface electronegativity these data show that tnt b has the potential to be an adequate nanofiller to improve polymeric membranes characteristics for better rejection and permeation performance 3 2 characterisation of dlhfm 3 2 1 effect of different bffr the first parameter investigated was the bffr ro water was used as bore fluid the bffr was selected based on the ratio between dsfr and bffr of 3 1 3 1 5 and 1 1 fig 3 shows the surface micrographs and cross section morphology of dlhfm prepared at different bffr while table 3 shows the lumen size thickness inner finger like structure length diameter outer layer finger like thickness length of mmm and all dlhfm prepared in this study based on the sem micrographs shown in fig 3 both pvdf bffr1 and pvdf bffr1 5 did not show significant changes in membrane lumen size as both membranes recorded a lumen size of 425 12 μm and 433 8 μm respectively however the lumen size of pvdf bffr3 was significantly increased to 635 11 μm all membranes exhibited a three layered structure which consists of finger like structure in the inner layer a dense structure in the middle and a thinner finger like structure underneath the selective layer on the outer layer of membrane these three layered structures were formed from the concurrent extrusion of two dope solution this structure is known as the sandwich like structure which is due to the suspension coagulation instability during phase inversion process since 5 wt of pore former has been added in the inner layer a porous inner membrane structure was obtained song et al also observed the increase in membrane porosity when polyethylene glycol peg was used as pore forming agent 40 the inner layer exhibited longer finger like structure compared to the outer layer due to the difference in pore former loading as inner layer dope solution was added with 5 wt of pvp whist outer layer dope solution was only added with 1 wt of pvp the lower bffr also inhibited the phase inversion process as indicated by the membrane wall thickness the wall thickness of pvdf bffr1 pvdf bffr1 5 pvdf bffr3 measured from the sem images was 715 17 μm 735 12 μm and 685 13 μm respectively when the bffr was increased the demixing of internal coagulant with solvent of polymer solution was accelerated followed by domain growth that reached the point of solidification the faster phase inversion promoted the formation of longer finger like structure as exhibited in fig 3 c2 on the other hand slower phase inversion process for pvdf bffr1 and pvdf bffr1 5 due to lower bffr promoted the formation of larger dense layer in the middle of the membrane higher bffr resulted in complete polymer precipitation as the non solvent penetrated from the lumen side into the membrane matrix which led to higher precipitation rate 41 compared to mmm all dlhfm exhibited smaller membrane lumen due to the presence of two different dope solution which flowed concurrently additionally mmm membranes exhibited longer inner layer finger like structure the flow rate of mmm membrane was 3 ml min while the flowrate of dlhfm was 6 ml min combining inner and outer dsfr theoretically more dope solution would be flowing though the spinneret during the spinning of dlhfm as compared to that of mmm the lower flow rate of mmm would allow faster demixing which would be the reason why longer inner layer finger like structure was observed for mmm as compared to dlhfm the surface roughness of the membranes fabricated with different bffr was analysed through afm fig 4 shows the 3d afm surface images and surface roughness ra values of pvdf bffr1 pvdf bffr1 5 pvdf bffr3 and mmm in these images the brightest area represents the highest point of membrane surface and the dark regions indicate valley or membrane pores the 3d afm images of all membranes exhibited the formation of nodule like structure which aggregated on the outer surface table 4 shows the 3d surface roughness values of mmm and all dlhfm prepared in this study pvdf bffr3 exhibited the lowest rq and the roughness parameter was similar to that of mmm the membrane surface roughness increased when bffr was increased from 1 ml min and 1 5 ml min with low bffr the occurrence of phase inversion within the membrane lumen was also hampered hence leading to delayed liquid liquid demixing when the nascent membrane entered the coagulation bath phase inversion via the membrane outer surface took place at a much higher rate resulted in the leaching of pore former from inner layer and outer layer dope solution through the membrane surface this phenomenon increased the membrane surface roughness with the formation of conglomerated nodules on the other hand this phenomenon was averted for membrane pvdf bffr3 since the flowrate ratio between inner layer dope solution and bore fluid are the same 3 ml min phase inversion occurred at a higher rate though the inner layer compared to the outer layer this reduced the leaching of pore former through the membrane surface which led to lower membrane surface roughness 41 due to the controlled distribution of tnt b0 5 in the outer layer instead of randomly distributed throughout the polymer matrix the hydrophilic nanofiller could more significantly alter the membrane surface porosity and hydrophilicity table 5 shows the water uptake porosity and contact angle of mmm and all dlhfm prepared in this study table 5 shows the water uptake porosity and contact angle of the membranes spun using different bffr hydrophilic nanofillers have been favourably incorporated to improve the hydrophilicity of hydrophobic polymers such as pvdf mmm membrane exhibited a contact angle of 73 83 the distribution of the nanofillers within polymer matrix of the outer layer has significantly reduced the contact angle particularly for pvdf bffr3 which exhibited the lowest contact angle of 64 44 as more hydrophilic nanomaterials were distribution within the outer layer of membrane the water uptake volume was similar for all membranes implying that spinning parameter does not influence water uptake for membrane porosity mmm exhibited the highest membrane porosity while increase in bffr led to higher membrane porosity higher bffr accelerated the solvent nonsolvent demixing thus promoted the formation of finger like structures and macrovoid and improved the membrane porosity 42 the influence of bffr towards the permeation and rejection of dlhfm using pure water bsa lignin and ta as model solutions was investigated it was noticed that the bffr greatly affected the membrane permeability and rejection capabilities this spinning parameter directly affected the thickness of the dlhfm fig 5 a shows the flux of pure water bsa lignin and ta and b the rejection performance for bsa 67 kda lignin 127 kda and ta 17 kda a molecular weight cut off mwco graph was also plotted and added in the supplementary file as s2 due to the thinner membrane structure mmm with single layer exhibited higher permeation compared to that of pvdf bffr1 and pvdf bffr1 5 the reduced resistance for liquid transport across the membrane wall has enhanced the water permeability however it was observed that pvdf bffr3 exhibited higher flux for all solutions tested as compared to mmm the smaller wall thickness due to faster phase inversion process improved membrane transport properties additionally the higher surface hydrophilicity due to the immobilisation of nanofiller on membrane outer layer enhanced the flux 43 the removal exhibited by the membranes are solely via sieving mechanism the development of the dlhfm was to ensure the deposition of nanofillers are concentrated solely on the membrane surface this would improve water transport across membrane and improve rejection as seen in the results shown in this work all dlhfm exhibited higher rejection for all tested solute as compared to mmm owing to the increased transport resistance across the membrane low bffr slowed down phase inversion process hence producing a thicker membrane layer however faster bffr would enhance the movement of solvent across dope solution and out of polymer matrix this would produce a membrane with long and intrinsic asymmetrical structure due to the simultaneous movement of pore formers out of membrane matrix and continuous coagulation of polymer in membrane matrix dlhfm exhibited a dense structure in the middle of the membrane which is absent in mmm fig 2 d3 the presence of a dense layer in between the asymmetrical structures can improve membrane rejection as all dlhfm exhibited greater rejection of all tested solutes compared to mmm the optimization of bffr showed that pvdf bffr3 exhibited the highest flux and rejection hence the bore fluid of 3 ml min was fixed for the optimisation of olfr 3 2 2 effect of different olfr the manipulation of olfr is important to understand the effect of different outer dsfr on the thickness of the membrane outer layer this is paramount as the selective layer would govern the permeation and rejection of the dlhfm prepared a minimum ratio between olfr and inner layer flow rate ilfr of 1 1 was set due to the configuration of spinneret fig 6 shows the surface and cross section morphology of pvdf olfr3 pvdf olfr4 5 and pvdf olfr6 based on cross sectional morphology the higher olfr has increased the thickness of the membrane outer layer as shown in fig 6 a2 c2 all the dlhfm exhibited three distinct layers where there is the outermost layer the interface layer between outer layer dope solution and inner layer dope solution and the inner layer this observation is similar with the membranes that were spun at different bffr as shown in fig 6 both inner and outer layer shows a narrow finger like structure while the interfacial layer shows a porous macrovoid structure however the finger like structure of outer layer elongated with the increase of olfr additionally no evidence of delamination was observed in the cross section micrographs which is in good agreement with previous research work done delamination was not observed as the same polymers were used for both outer and inner layer hence good compatibility was achieved between the outer and inner layers with the polymer content of 15 wt and 18 wt used for the outer and inner layer the outer layer experienced greater shrinkage rate as compared to inner layer during phase inversion process as a result the inner layer was tightly wrapped by the outer layer similar structure of dlhfm has been reported by dzinun et al who fabricated dlhfm with pvdf as polymers 44 the lower viscosity of the outer layer dope solution due to low polymer loading could have been compensated with the addition of nanofiller which increased the dope viscosity all dlhfm exhibited similar surface structure with evidence of tubular looking rods attached on it indicating the presence of tnt b nanotubes with increased olfr the middle layer exhibited higher thickness due to larger volume of dope solution provision during phase inversion process as seen in fig 6 a2 b2 c2 fig 7 shows the 3d afm images of all membranes prepared at different olfr it can be noticed that the membrane surface roughness reduced with the increasing olfr pvdf olfr6 exhibited the lowest surface roughness of 26 82 9 28 nm and lowest rz at 149 17 55 42 nm when the dope solution is extruded at a higher rate the polymer molecular chains tend to align themselves better the enhancement of molecular orientation causes the polymer molecules to pack closer to each other which leads to a tighter structure hence further reducing membrane surface roughness 45 as tabulated in table 5 the water contact angle increased with increasing olfr on the other hand lower water uptake and membrane porosity were observed when the olfr was increased from 3 ml min to 6 ml min it was expected that with higher olfr the hydrophilicity would be improved as more nanofiller was incorporated into the membrane outer layer however this phenomenon has been offset by the hydrophobicity of polymer these results were reflected by the lower water uptake value with higher olfr and lower porosity fig 8 shows the flux and rejection performance for bsa lignin and ta for membranes prepared at different olfr a molecular weight cut off mwco graph was also plotted and added in the supplementary file as s2 the increment of olfr reduced the membrane thickness as observed in table 3 all dual layer membranes exhibited higher flux for all solute tested as compared to mmm which again highlights the advantage of dual layer membrane configuration referring to fig 8 a when the olfr was increased from 3 ml min to 4 5 ml min and 6 ml min there was a small drop of flux for all solutes tested with the highest flux values for pure water bsa lignin and ta at 106 07 l m2h 107 48 l m2h 40 31 l m2h and 29 70 l m2h respectively was recorded by pvdf olfr3 the drop in flux may be due to the increased membrane transport resistance with higher olfr the increased olfr produced a thicker middle layer as observed in fig 6 a2 b2 c2 due to larger volume of dope solution experiencing mutual diffusion with inner layer dope solution gradual improvement in membrane rejection capabilities was observed when the olfr was increased in which membrane pvdf olfr6 exhibited the highest rejection for bsa lignin and ta at 98 49 98 86 and 71 96 respectively while membrane pvdf olfr3 recorded similar rejection of 98 01 98 40 and 68 91 for bsa lignin and ta respectively the results showed that manipulation of olfr of dlhfm could enhance flux but insignificant in improving membrane rejection properties a higher olfr promoted a thicker intermediate layer between both inner and outer finger like structure as observed in fig 6 this played a role in increasing membrane transport resistance and hindered membrane permeation however it did not improve membrane rejection properties based on the results it was concluded that membranes spun with olfr of 3 ml min was the best due to slightly enhanced flux while maintaining its rejection performance 3 2 3 effect of different ag fig 9 shows the changes in membrane surface and cross section morphology under tem analysis when ag was manipulated as 5 10 and 15 cm all membrane surface exhibited similar morphology at different ag values as seen in fig 9 a1 b1 c1 indicating the manipulation of ag does not lead to significant changes in membrane surface structure however noticeable changes have been observed in membrane cross section morphology the membrane diameter decreased with the increasing ag as the membrane was exposed to longer period of gravitational pull which in turn increased the elongation force exerted on the fibers exiting the spinneret this phenomenon reduced the thickness of the membranes a similar phenomenon was observed by said et al when ag was manipulated between 3 cm to 50 cm for the preparation of psf hollow fiber membrane 46 however since the travel time for nascent membrane from spinneret to outer coagulant bath was increased with higher ag the outer layer finger like structure length was reduced fig 10 shows the 3d afm images of dlhfm prepared at different ag when the ag was increased the number of needle like nodules becomes larger with reduced difference between peak and valley this phenomenon would decrease the membrane surface roughness at higher ag the polymeric molecular chain tends to align themselves much better than that of lower ag the enhanced orientation resulted in the closer packing of polymer molecules to form tighter structure 47 additionally at higher ag the travel time between spinneret to external coagulant bath was increased this promoted the formation of thin selective layer on the membrane surface due to the evaporation of solvent from dope solution into the environment both phenomena have led to smoother membrane surface as observed in in fig 10 a b and c when the ag was increased the membrane thickness showed a reducing trend as seen in table 5 past study has shown that membranes with smaller wall thickness can contribute towards higher hydrophilicity 48 sem images elucidated in fig 9 show a reduction in membrane wall thickness for membranes spun at higher ag which translated to higher hydrophilicity the membrane water uptake was also increased which is in tandem with lower contact angle the ag between spinneret and coagulation bath is important as it governs the membrane surface properties and eventual rejection performance since two dope solutions are extruded simultaneously the effect of ag towards the membrane performance may vary as compared to single layered hollow fiber membrane fig 11 shows the flux and rejection performance of dlhfm prepared at different ag on the permeation and rejection of bsa lignin and ta a molecular weight cut off mwco graph was also plotted and added in the supplementary file as s2 as observed in fig 11 a the flux of membranes shows a reducing trend when ag was increased from 5 cm to 15 cm pvdf ag5 exhibited the highest flux among all membranes tested the flux values of pvdf ag5 for pure water bsa lignin and ta is 107 48 l m2h 108 88 l m2h 40 31 l m2h and 29 35 l m2h respectively when ag increased the travel time of nascent membrane from spinneret to coagulation bath increases this phenomenon would allow greater time for solvent to diffuse through air forming a thin layer on membrane surface before it reaches the coagulation bath to complete the phase inversion process longer travel time would create a denser thin layer on the membrane surface which would hinder membrane permeation however this would improve membrane rejection performance as evidenced in fig 11 b membrane pvdf ag10 exhibited the best rejection performance for all tested solute with rejection of 99 86 99 04 and 76 46 of bsa lignin and ta respectively the increase in rejection can be attributed to the denser thin layer formed on membrane surface however membrane pvdf ag15 exhibited a slight drop in rejection performance rejecting 96 71 of bsa 68 63 of lignin and 64 11 of ta as the coagulated dope solution was passing through the ag region the larger mass of the fiber at longer ag could induce an increase in extrusion rate this phenomenon resulted in membrane stretching which consequently led to defects that compromise membrane rejection performance 49 based on the results obtained in this section it can be concluded that an ag of 10 cm is the best in terms of producing dlhfm with high flux and rejection capabilities hence for the following optimisation an ag of 10 cm was used for the optimization of nanofiller loading 3 2 4 effect of different nanofiller loading fig 12 shows the changes in membrane surface and cross section morphology when the loading of nanofiller in outer layer dope solution was varied to 1 wt 2 wt and 3 wt all the dlhfm exhibited asymmetrical finger like structure on both outer and inner part of the membranes these membranes also exhibited a three layered structure the middle structure for pvdf l1 shows a sponge like structure while both pvdf l2 and pvdf l3 shows a porous macrovoid structure in place of the sponge like structure sponge like structures are commonly associated to slower phase inversion process additionally no signs of delamination were observed between both layers even at 3 wt nanofiller loading which shows great compatibility between both dope solutions when the nanofiller loading was increased there was an increment in the length of finger like structure on the outer layer of membrane it was also observed that the dense interlayer started to diminish with increase in nanofiller loading due to the hydrophilicity of tnt b incorporated in the outer layer large amount of water was attracted towards the membranes during phase inversion hence increases the rate of phase inversion dzinun et al 2015 with the increasing hydrophilicity of the dope solution upon the addition of more tnt b it was observed that the finger like length increased as reflected in table 3 fig 13 shows the cross section edx mapping of mmm and pvdf l1 fig 13 shows the edx mapping of both said membranes which confirmed the distribution of tnt b on the membrane outer layer it was observed that the even distribution of tnt b0 5 across the membrane matrix for mmm while the nanofiller could mainly be observed in the outer layer of dlhfm a small amount of tnt b0 5 also presented in the inner layer of pvdf l1 which suggested the diffusion of outer dope solution towards inner dope solution phase inversion took place on the inner part of membrane once bore fluid was introduced during the spinning and completed when the membrane entered the external coagulant bath upon exiting the spinneret the mixing of the highly miscible polymer dopes of inner and outer layer could possibly take place this explains the presence of nanomaterials which are initially absent in the inner layer dope solution however the edx mapping shows that the large portion of tnt b0 5 was concentrated on the membrane outer layer which confirms the fact that single step dual layer spinning allows controlled distribution of nanomaterials fig 14 shows the 3d afm surface images of all dlhfm prepared at different nanofiller loading on outer layer the addition of nanomaterials into polymeric dope solution increased the dope viscosity hence delaying phase inversion process 43 additionally the presence of needle like tnt on the outer layer dope solution can also influence membrane surface roughness by promoting the development of ridge and valley structure on the membrane surface 50 based on fig 14 a b and c all membrane surface exhibited nodular like needles while data in table 4 showed an increase in surface roughness when nanofiller loading was increased from 1 wt 34 88 4 78 nm to 2 wt 41 51 9 10 nm ong et al reported a surface roughness of 10 4 nm when 1 wt of tio2 was added in dope solution while mmm in this current work reported a surface roughness of 36 74 4 66 nm 51 pvdf l3 with contact angle of 58 03 exhibited the highest surface hydrophilicity among the membranes dzinun et al reported the increase in surface hydrophilicity with the increasing tio2 loading 52 the increased concentration of in hydrophilic nanomaterial on membrane surface contributed to lower contact angle value the membranes also exhibited higher porosity with the increased nanofiller loading fig 15 shows the flux and rejection performance of dlhfm prepared at different nanofiller loading on the permeation and rejection of bsa lignin and ta a molecular weight cut off mwco graph was also plotted and added in the supplementary file as s2 it can be observed in fig 15 that all dlhfm exhibited higher flux for all solute tested as compared to mmm particularly membrane pvdf l3 exhibited the highest flux for pure water bsa lignin and ta at 106 07 l m2h 136 28 l m2h 43 49 l m2h and 33 24 l m2h respectively pvdf l3 also exhibited the highest flux among all dlhfm prepared in this study the increased loading of nanomaterial in membrane structure played an important role in this improvement as discussed in section 3 1 0 tnt b exhibited good hydrophilicity due to the presence of hydroxyl functional groups which is necessary to attract water across membrane the improvement in membrane hydrophilicity with increased loading was also observed the enhancement in membrane hydrophilicity improved the absorption of water molecules within the membrane surface which in turn enhanced the water permeation through membrane however the high flux exhibited may also due to the defects formation resulted from tnt b0 5 agglomeration 43 previous research has shown that when nanomaterial loading is very high agglomeration of nanomaterial will occur and this would lead to formation of defected membrane that enhances flux but compromises membrane rejection properties 53 54 however there was no clear trend in flux values with increment of tnt b0 5 loading with pvdf l2 exhibiting lower flux values compared to pvdf l1 and pvdf l3 for all solutions tested the reduction of flux exhibited by pvdf l2 may be due to the slower demixing of solvent nonsolvent during phase inversion process it is a well established fact that greater loading of nanomaterial is known to increase dope solution viscosity which in turns delay the phase inversion process 55 this may lead to the formation of denser membranes which reduced flux but improved membrane rejection capabilities in terms of rejection all dlhfm exhibited improved rejection performance as compared to mmm with pvdf l2 exhibiting the best rejection for bsa lignin and ta at 99 12 99 06 and 78 51 respectively on the other hand pvdf l3 exhibited the worst rejection performance for bsa lignin and ta at 96 15 97 68 and 55 67 respectively this correlates to the increment in flux exhibited by pvdf l3 compared to pvdf l2 at higher nanomaterial loading above threshold value the agglomeration of nanomaterials in the membrane matrix may lead to formation of large voids this would enhance flux but compromise rejection the flux and rejection data showed that the optimum loading of tnt b0 5 into outer layer of dlhfm is 2 wt the denser selective layer exhibited by pvdf l2 was able to improve rejection the results indicated that pvdf l2 is the best candidate for the treatment of at pome 4 conclusion a pvdf based dlhfm incorporated with tnt b in their outer layer were successfully developed using a triple orifice spinneret various characterisations showed the formation of tubular structure deposited with boron high crystallinity and a large surface area with abundant surface hydroxyl functional group these results showed that tnt b is a good nanofiller as it resulted in improved rejection and permeation dlhfm membranes of various spinning parameters including single layered mmm different bffr different olfr different ag and different nanofiller loading were fabricated to understand the effect of each key parameters towards membrane morphology surface roughness hydrophilicity permeation and rejection of various solutions including pure water and bsa lignin and ta were also used as model solutions mimicking at pome the development of dlhfm suggested that a bffr of 3 ml min olfr of 3 ml min ag of 10 cm and nanofiller loading of 2 wt is the best in developing a dlhfm which can retain high flux while exhibiting high rejection of both lignin flux 37 48 l m2h rejection 99 06 and ta flux 25 46 l m2h rejection 78 51 model solutes of at pome the formation of finger like asymmetrical structure on the inner layer of membrane and dense layer in the middle and a thin selective layer on the surface where hydrophilic nanofillers is concentrated contributed to improved rejection without compromising the flux declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have

14031,the ethanol distillery generates a huge quantum of undesirable dark brown coloured wastewater called distillery spent wash dsw or vinasse which has high cod and bod presently the disposal of dsw sustainably and efficiently is a major scientific engineering economic and environmental challenge in front of the distillery industry in the present manuscript a comprehensive approach has been made to elucidate the physicochemical properties of dsw and explored its potential for the production of commodity chemicals the characterization of dsw samples collected from different distilleries throughout india was done by various analytical techniques such as hplc elemental analysis tds tss and ash content etc typically the cod of dsw samples was found in the range of 1 10 000 to 2 05 000 ppm parts per million due to the variable composition of dissolved organic compounds of the total cod a 1 2 is contributed by sugars like xylose glucose and sucrose b 30 36 by carboxylic acids like formic acid acetic acid propionic acid and butyric acid c 5 6 by alcohol like ethanol and d 50 57 by melanoidins and caramels the estimated statistics based on the present study depicted that dsw can be a potential chemical pool for the production of commodity chemicals assessment of dsw for the production of commodity chemicals could appreciably contribute to both the economic and environmental aspects of distillery wastewater management however future distillery can be directed as a multiproduct industry for the production of commodity chemicals from distillery wastewater keywords distillery spent wash vinasse carboxylic acid melanoidins 1 introduction india is the largest sugar consumer and second largest sugar producer country across the globe as per agro processing industries across the country the sugar industry is regarded as the second largest sector after the textile industry 1 3 the major key raw material for the sugar industry is sugar cane and its production and quality depend on climatic and geographical conditions 4 6 presently sugar industries are facing huge challenges to get maximum sugar recovery however to balance the economics of the sugar industry molasses based distilleries bio methanation plant and bagasse based co generation plants are integrated with the sugar industry 7 9 there are about 579 sugar mills in india out of which 285 are connected to distilleries 10 the sugar and distillery industry produce a humongous amount of solid liquid waste materials such as a bagasse b press mud carbon pmc c fermentation sludge fs and d distillery spent wash dsw most of the distilleries are unable to manage such a huge quantum of the waste efficiently and economically however sugar and distillery industries are regarded as the most polluting industry and categorized as the red class industry by central pollution control board 11 12 thus there is an urge to understand and explore the sustainable distillery waste treatment technologies currently in india distillery solid wastes like pmc and fs are usually disposed off by composting and bagasse is used for steam power generation while the dsw is partially treated through bio methanation or mee etc 13 14 due to complex nature and huge quantum of generation an efficient treatment of dsw is not available till this date dsw is an unwanted dark brown coloured liquid generated from reboiler in the distillery with an obnoxious odour on an average about 12 15 liters of dsw is produced per liter of alcohol thus approximately 40 billion liters of spent wash generated per annum from 285 distilleries across the country 15 typically dsw contains caramelization products and recalcitrant components having high chemical oxygen demand cod biological oxygen demand bod along with inorganic salts and low ph 16 17 the unscientific disposal of dsw in open drains and landfill in the vicinity of distilleries creates several environmental issues due to its toxic nature 18 therefore distillery industries are eagerly searching for an economically feasible scientific dsw treatment technology it attracts researchers to explore novel ideas for the development of new sustainable technologies several reports are available regarding different treatment methods technologies for disposal and or treatment of dsw such as a anaerobic digestion ad b adsorption c coagulation d flocculation and e oxidation etc 19 22 of the possible dsw treatment technologies ad is a most routine and popular dsw treatment method used in the distillery to produce biogas 23 25 the adsorbents such as chitosan chemically modified bagasse and activated carbon etc are also explored for removal of colour and specific organic pollutants from dsw due to their high surface area microporous structure high adsorption capacity and a high degree of surface reactivity 26 28 in addition to this coagulants and flocculants are also used to form large agglomerates by aggregating the pollutants which are easy to separate but these methods seem to be expensive to treat huge quantum of dsw due to large expenses on chemicals 29 31 in the case of chemical treatment oxidation seems to be one of the promising option for disposal of dsw ozone gas in the presence of h2o2 and iron salts is used most frequently 32 33 pikaev et al 34 have reported the use of radiation technology for disposal of spent wash the ultrasound based technology was applied to increase the bio degradability of dsw 35 photodegradation of dsw using cr tio2 and v tio2 as photocatalyst is reported 36 37 there are few reports were available for exploring dsw to obtain value added products such as manure fertilizer micronutrients and lipids etc 38 jain et al 39 have reported the nutrient composition of the spent wash petit et al 40 have explored spent wash for lipid production thus several approaches have been convoyed and deployed to get relief from dsw either by treating it or by producing value added products fertilizers but the reported dsw disposal treatment methods have their own advantages and drawbacks however till this date there is no permanent solution in the market for the sustainable treatment of dsw thus in addition to environmental issues the sugar and distillery industry is facing extensive problems for a scarcity of water chemically dsw is a very complex mixture and it is very crucial to understand the physicochemical properties to develop a novel and feasible strategies dsw contains a large spectrum of organic compounds inorganic salts and caramelization products novel approaches for separation of these components will help to project dsw as a chemical mine for the production of commodity chemicals as best of our knowledge there is no report available for consideration of the potential of dsw as a chemical mine in the present manuscript we have made a methodical attempt to investigate the physicochemical properties of dsw and reported its potential for the production of commodity chemicals for ease of understanding the overall cod of dsw is bifurcated into four major parts a sugars b acids c alcohols and d caramels and melanoidins of the total organic content the contribution and importance of significant components are estimated thus the projected approach will encourage future researchers to device the technology which considers dsw as a chemical pool and it can add significant revenue to the distillery with added environmental benefits 2 materials and experimental method 2 1 chemicals all the chemicals and chemical reagents were purchased from synthetic grade chemical suppliers and used without further purification the chemicals and solvents used for hplc mobile phase preparation were hplc grade chemicals purchased from s d fine the standards for hplc analysis were purchased from sigma aldrich and used without further purification for analysis all the experimental values are the mean of three experiments that may vary 5 based on the variable composition of dsw 2 2 hplc analysis for quantification of carbohydrates and carboxylic acids the carbohydrates such as glucose xylose and sucrose as well as organic acids such as formic acid acetic acid propionic acid were quantified by using agilent 1200 hplc equipped with ri detector and aminex 87h 300 x 7 8 mm 9 μm particle size 8 cross linkage bio rad laboratories inc the 5 mm h2so4 mobile phase is passed at column temperature 65 c with a flow rate of 0 6 ml min detector ri detector rid the 10 μl sample was injected for analysis 2 3 elemental and cod analysis the elemental analysis was conducted by using thermo scientific flash 2000 chns o analyzer about 1 5 to 3 0 mg of dried sample with suitable protocol and kept in a desiccator to maintain minimum moisture at the time of analysis was used for the analysis standard protocol as per the specification of thermo scientific flash 2000 c h n s and o analyzer was followed the oxygen content in the sample was calculated by difference the cod analysis was conducted by using closed reflux spectrophotometric method cod vials are heated in hi 839800 cod reactor hanna instruments 2 4 uv visible spectrophotometric analysis the uv and visible light absorbance of the sample was measured by using shimadzu uv 2550 uv visible spectrophotometer the samples were diluted up to an appropriate dilution factor using ro water uv visible spectrophotometer calibrated by using ro water in both cuvettes 2 5 atr ftir analysis the atr ftir analysis attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was conducted on the shimadzu ir prestige 21 kyoto japan instrument coupled with the specac golden gate gs10500 atr assembly 3 result and discussion 3 1 proximate analysis of various dsw during the alcohol production process the dsw is generated from the bottom of the rectifier column shown in scheme 1 physically it s a dark brown liquid with a specific obnoxious smell of caramelized products the physiochemical characteristics of the dsw obtained from different distilleries are highly inconsistent it was reported that the properties of dsw produced are highly dependent on raw materials used for fermentation and the different aspects of ethanol production 41 the dsw samples were collected from different distilleries located at different locations throughout the india such as sample 1 western region western maharashtra sample 2 north region utter pradesh sample 3 northeast region uttarakhand sample 4 southeast region tamil nadu and sample 5 northwestern region punjab the samples were collected directly from running waste stream of dsw in a distillery and tested for their physicochemical properties as received the analysis of samples was conducted in three sets of reparative experiments and the mean value is indicated in graphs the proximate and physicochemical analysis of dsw obtained from various molasses based distilleries is shown table 1 and fig 1 it was observed that there is no significant variation in physical parameters such as ph colour and density but the remarkable variation was noted in the case of cod tds and ash content of the collected samples it is noted that cod ranges from 1 10 000 to 2 05 500 ppm tds ranges from 1 10 000 2 46 500 ppm conductivity ranges from 45 58 ms cm and ash content ranges from 2 4 5 it was noted that there is a significant variation in tss content from 0 5 3 5 and in conductivity from 45 58 ms cm the tss of dsw can be observed due to the presence of fermented cell cellulose microfibers salts and biomass slime while conductivity is because of dissolved inorganic salts the atr ftir spectra of dry tss collected from dsw shows the peaks at 1072 cm 1 s o 1408 cm 1 1544 cm 1 nh 1672 cm 1 c o 2926 cm 1 ch 2954 cm 1 ch and 3273 cm 1 oh which confirms the presence of proteins cellulose microfibers and biomass slime etc fig s1 esi while the atr ftir spectra of ash obtained from tss showed the absence of 1408 cm 1 1544 cm 1 nh 1672 cm 1 c o 2926 cm 1 ch 2954 cm 1 ch 3273 cm 1 oh and presence of peaks only at 1036 cm 1 613 cm 1 496 cm 1 which indicated the presence of inorganic matter only thus it can be speculated that the tss in dsw contains proteins cellulose and inorganic salts in the ethanol production process several distilleries have integrated decanters to separate sludge from dsw thus the percentage of tss depends on the use and efficiency of a decanter the dsw contains 3 4 tss before decanter but integration of decanter reduces the tss content significantly 0 5 furthermore it was noted that the dsw has a huge variation in cod and tds value the tds was estimated by evaporating water from dsw which is nothing but total dissolved solids organic inorganic present in dsw the variation in cod tds and ash contents depicted the diverse composition of dissolved solids in dsw in the distillery unit operations dsw is generated after the fermentation of molasses thus the steps before fermentation and molasses production are significantly contributing to variation in cod tds and ash content it is reported that the dark brown colour of dsw is because of maillard reaction products and caramels formed during the sugar cane juice concentration process 42 however the concentration of caramels and melanoidins can be dependent on a variation in unit operation during molasses generation ethanol fermentation b variety of cane and c operating parameters for sugar and ethanol production process etc in order to understand the presence of the dissolved carbonaceous compound the residue obtained after the evaporation of dsw is subjected to an elemental analysis the elemental analysis of tds obtained after the evaporation of water from dsw is depicted that there is a slight variation in elemental composition among all the tested samples shown fig s3 esi the atr ftir spectra of tds residue after water evaporation shown in fig 2 depicted the presence of 1039 cm 1 s o 1122 cm 1 ch 1402 cm 1 nh 1570 cm 1 nh 2927 cm 1 ch 3206 cm 1 oh which indicated the presence of acids alcohols and maillard reaction products etc the hplc analysis of subsequent samples was also conducted which depicted the presence of sugars acids and alcohol in dsw fig s5 esi however the overall cod of dsw is composed of carbonaceous compounds such as acids sugars alcohols and maillard reaction products while the overall tds is composed of carbonaceous compounds and inorganic salts of the tested samples there is a huge variation 2 28 4 4 in ash content was noted the ash in dsw is due to the presence of dissolved salts used during the cane juice clarification and fermentation process the amount of inorganic salt present as an ash in dsw may vary concerning the sugar industry and distillery it noted that the typical dsw contains 2 4 ash 3 2 volatile acids sugars and alcohol in dsw the dsw is the wastewater stream generated after fermentation of molasses with subsequent alcohol recovery thus there is a strong probability for the existence of volatile acids alcohols and unreacted sugars in the spent wash which contributes to the cod of dsw in order to check the concentration of volatile acids alcohols and unreacted sugars all the samples obtained from different distilleries are subjected to hplc analysis the hplc analysis was conducted in triplicate and the mean values are mentioned in figures the observed deviation was depicted in the graph it was noted that there is a 3 deviation in the percentage of organic acid and alcohol except sample 3 5 the quantitative analysis of volatile acids alcohols and sugars are shown fig 3 it was observed that all the spent wash samples obtained from different distilleries contains a sugars xylose glucose and sucrose b carboxylic acids formic acid fa acetic acid aa propionic acid pr acid and butyric acid but acid and c alcohol ethanol the concentration range for these components is very ambiguous which can be dependent on various factors of molasses fermentation and unit operations thus the variable percentage of carboxylic acids and alcohol can be attributed to the use of molasses from different locations molasses storage time and facility and distillery unit operations etc of the tested samples the concentration of sugars 0 3 1 0 carboxylic acids 0 80 10 0 and alcohol 0 07 0 48 was in variable range but the presence of carboxylic is found to be maximum the presence of sugars is due to unreacted molasses while the presence of alcohol is due to tipping of alcohol in the distillation process or fermentation of unreacted sugars in the spent wash the major constituent of dsw is carboxylic acids which can be carried forward from molasses or can be generated as side products during the alcohol fermentation process the formation of fa aa pr acid and but acid as a co product of alcohol fermentation is reported 43 44 3 3 overall cod convergence in dsw the cod of spent wash ranges from 1 10 000 to 2 05 500 ppm because of all dissolved organic components present in dsw in the present study it was observed that the overall cod of dsw is a cohesive combination of cod of a caramels melanoidins b biopolymers c acids sugars d alcohols others the cod contribution of sugars acids alcohols melanoidins and others in respective dsw samples is depicted fig 4 of the total cod significant contribution of cod is due to acids melanoidins and other biopolymers were noted the melanoidins and other biopolymers were formed in the maillard reaction during the heating process of sugar cane juice and these components are carry forwarded in molasses and then in dsw 45 46 the presence of dark brown colour of dsw is majorly due to maillard reaction and caramelized products in order to check the presence of these products uv visible spectra of respective samples were obtained fig s4 esi the uv visible spectra clearly depicted the absorbance maxima at λmax 280 nm and 400 nm which is indicative of maillard reaction products 47 the chemical structures of these products are still unknown because it depends on the initial concentration of reacting species temperature condition time and ph etc 48 the dark brown colour of dsw is an indicative for the presence of these components the strong dark brown colour of dsw resists the penetration of sunlight in the water which is hazardous for aquatic life 49 the analysis of dsw clearly depicted complexity in handling and its treatment but on the other hand dsw can be a chemical mine for the future due to the presence of commodity chemicals of the total organic tds it majorly composed of fa aa pr acid and but acid and ethanol as well fig 5 the estimated values of corresponding acid alcohol and others can be a variable as per the initial chemical composition of dsw in the present study it was noted that there is a 3 deviation in the percentage of organic acid and alcohol except sample 3 5 thus the estimated quantities of tpd is based on deviation and hplc analysis of different samples used in the present study however based on estimated values it can be speculated that an efficient strategy for the separation and isolation of these components significantly contributes to produce carboxylic acids from the waste the estimated potential of the distillery to produces commodity chemicals from 1000 klpd kl per day dsw is shown in fig 6 thus based on the average composition of respective components it can be speculated that the 1000 klpd dsw has the potential to produce 23 77 tpd tons per day of fa 1 10 tpd of aa 1 10 tpd pr acid 1 6 tpd of but acid and 2 7 tpd ethanol the estimated quantum of respective components clearly provides an idea for building a sustainable strategy to separate these chemicals form dsw and improve the economics of distillery 3 4 strategy for carboxylic acids recovery in the process of dsw disposal technologists preferred volume reduction before treatment of dsw which decreases the ultimate cost of effluent treatment several technological options are available in the market for volume reduction of dsw such as reverse osmosis ro and multiple effect evaporation mee etc but of the possible options mee is a widely used technique because of its low cost and high efficiency 50 during mee water gets evaporated along with low boiling components present in dsw the dsw components such as carboxylic acids and ethanol were evaporated with water and ended into the condensate shown in fig 7 the presence of these components was confirmed by hplc analysis the hplc analysis was conducted in triplicate and the mean value mentioned in the table it was noted that there is a 3 deviation in the percentage of carboxylic acids and cod the analysis of volatile components in mee condensate water obtained from different molasses based distilleries is shown in table 2 of the tested samples of mee condensate the diverse range of cod with variable ph the variable concentration of carboxylic acids acetic acid propionic and butyric acid and ethanol were noted however the presence of these components in mee condensate provides evidence for the evaporation of carboxylic acids and ethanol from dsw during the mee operation since the concentration of these components in mee condensate can be dependent on the performance of mee as well as their abundance in dsw the abundance of ethanol in mee condensate was also noted which can be observed be due to the presence of ethanol in dsw formed during the dsw storage through the fermentation of residual sugars resulted from previous unit operation thus the volatile carboxylic acid components of spent wash can be recovered by integrating the acid recovery system and used as an additional revenue source to the distillery industry fig 8 4 conclusion in conclusion the present manuscript unbolts the new horizons for sustainable management of dsw to explore its potential for the production of commodity chemicals to the best of our knowledge this is the first report to discover the potential of dsw for the production of commodity chemicals overall cod of dsw is the combination of cod potential of sugars carboxylic acids alcohols caramels and melanoidins the percentage composition of dissolved chemical components in dsw varies and it majorly depends on feedstock composition distillery unit operation and operating conditions of the fermentation process if dsw is treated efficiently the recovery of carboxylic acid such as formic acid acetic acid propionic acid and butyric acid can be a major revenue generating source for distillery industries thus novel or conventional treatment of dsw along with recovery and separation of these chemical components would be far more beneficial to develop a new strategy however separation and recovery is still challenging tasks for future researchers conclusively dsw is not only a waste but a potential feedstock for the secondary chemical industry to produce green chemicals

14031,the ethanol distillery generates a huge quantum of undesirable dark brown coloured wastewater called distillery spent wash dsw or vinasse which has high cod and bod presently the disposal of dsw sustainably and efficiently is a major scientific engineering economic and environmental challenge in front of the distillery industry in the present manuscript a comprehensive approach has been made to elucidate the physicochemical properties of dsw and explored its potential for the production of commodity chemicals the characterization of dsw samples collected from different distilleries throughout india was done by various analytical techniques such as hplc elemental analysis tds tss and ash content etc typically the cod of dsw samples was found in the range of 1 10 000 to 2 05 000 ppm parts per million due to the variable composition of dissolved organic compounds of the total cod a 1 2 is contributed by sugars like xylose glucose and sucrose b 30 36 by carboxylic acids like formic acid acetic acid propionic acid and butyric acid c 5 6 by alcohol like ethanol and d 50 57 by melanoidins and caramels the estimated statistics based on the present study depicted that dsw can be a potential chemical pool for the production of commodity chemicals assessment of dsw for the production of commodity chemicals could appreciably contribute to both the economic and environmental aspects of distillery wastewater management however future distillery can be directed as a multiproduct industry for the production of commodity chemicals from distillery wastewater keywords distillery spent wash vinasse carboxylic acid melanoidins 1 introduction india is the largest sugar consumer and second largest sugar producer country across the globe as per agro processing industries across the country the sugar industry is regarded as the second largest sector after the textile industry 1 3 the major key raw material for the sugar industry is sugar cane and its production and quality depend on climatic and geographical conditions 4 6 presently sugar industries are facing huge challenges to get maximum sugar recovery however to balance the economics of the sugar industry molasses based distilleries bio methanation plant and bagasse based co generation plants are integrated with the sugar industry 7 9 there are about 579 sugar mills in india out of which 285 are connected to distilleries 10 the sugar and distillery industry produce a humongous amount of solid liquid waste materials such as a bagasse b press mud carbon pmc c fermentation sludge fs and d distillery spent wash dsw most of the distilleries are unable to manage such a huge quantum of the waste efficiently and economically however sugar and distillery industries are regarded as the most polluting industry and categorized as the red class industry by central pollution control board 11 12 thus there is an urge to understand and explore the sustainable distillery waste treatment technologies currently in india distillery solid wastes like pmc and fs are usually disposed off by composting and bagasse is used for steam power generation while the dsw is partially treated through bio methanation or mee etc 13 14 due to complex nature and huge quantum of generation an efficient treatment of dsw is not available till this date dsw is an unwanted dark brown coloured liquid generated from reboiler in the distillery with an obnoxious odour on an average about 12 15 liters of dsw is produced per liter of alcohol thus approximately 40 billion liters of spent wash generated per annum from 285 distilleries across the country 15 typically dsw contains caramelization products and recalcitrant components having high chemical oxygen demand cod biological oxygen demand bod along with inorganic salts and low ph 16 17 the unscientific disposal of dsw in open drains and landfill in the vicinity of distilleries creates several environmental issues due to its toxic nature 18 therefore distillery industries are eagerly searching for an economically feasible scientific dsw treatment technology it attracts researchers to explore novel ideas for the development of new sustainable technologies several reports are available regarding different treatment methods technologies for disposal and or treatment of dsw such as a anaerobic digestion ad b adsorption c coagulation d flocculation and e oxidation etc 19 22 of the possible dsw treatment technologies ad is a most routine and popular dsw treatment method used in the distillery to produce biogas 23 25 the adsorbents such as chitosan chemically modified bagasse and activated carbon etc are also explored for removal of colour and specific organic pollutants from dsw due to their high surface area microporous structure high adsorption capacity and a high degree of surface reactivity 26 28 in addition to this coagulants and flocculants are also used to form large agglomerates by aggregating the pollutants which are easy to separate but these methods seem to be expensive to treat huge quantum of dsw due to large expenses on chemicals 29 31 in the case of chemical treatment oxidation seems to be one of the promising option for disposal of dsw ozone gas in the presence of h2o2 and iron salts is used most frequently 32 33 pikaev et al 34 have reported the use of radiation technology for disposal of spent wash the ultrasound based technology was applied to increase the bio degradability of dsw 35 photodegradation of dsw using cr tio2 and v tio2 as photocatalyst is reported 36 37 there are few reports were available for exploring dsw to obtain value added products such as manure fertilizer micronutrients and lipids etc 38 jain et al 39 have reported the nutrient composition of the spent wash petit et al 40 have explored spent wash for lipid production thus several approaches have been convoyed and deployed to get relief from dsw either by treating it or by producing value added products fertilizers but the reported dsw disposal treatment methods have their own advantages and drawbacks however till this date there is no permanent solution in the market for the sustainable treatment of dsw thus in addition to environmental issues the sugar and distillery industry is facing extensive problems for a scarcity of water chemically dsw is a very complex mixture and it is very crucial to understand the physicochemical properties to develop a novel and feasible strategies dsw contains a large spectrum of organic compounds inorganic salts and caramelization products novel approaches for separation of these components will help to project dsw as a chemical mine for the production of commodity chemicals as best of our knowledge there is no report available for consideration of the potential of dsw as a chemical mine in the present manuscript we have made a methodical attempt to investigate the physicochemical properties of dsw and reported its potential for the production of commodity chemicals for ease of understanding the overall cod of dsw is bifurcated into four major parts a sugars b acids c alcohols and d caramels and melanoidins of the total organic content the contribution and importance of significant components are estimated thus the projected approach will encourage future researchers to device the technology which considers dsw as a chemical pool and it can add significant revenue to the distillery with added environmental benefits 2 materials and experimental method 2 1 chemicals all the chemicals and chemical reagents were purchased from synthetic grade chemical suppliers and used without further purification the chemicals and solvents used for hplc mobile phase preparation were hplc grade chemicals purchased from s d fine the standards for hplc analysis were purchased from sigma aldrich and used without further purification for analysis all the experimental values are the mean of three experiments that may vary 5 based on the variable composition of dsw 2 2 hplc analysis for quantification of carbohydrates and carboxylic acids the carbohydrates such as glucose xylose and sucrose as well as organic acids such as formic acid acetic acid propionic acid were quantified by using agilent 1200 hplc equipped with ri detector and aminex 87h 300 x 7 8 mm 9 μm particle size 8 cross linkage bio rad laboratories inc the 5 mm h2so4 mobile phase is passed at column temperature 65 c with a flow rate of 0 6 ml min detector ri detector rid the 10 μl sample was injected for analysis 2 3 elemental and cod analysis the elemental analysis was conducted by using thermo scientific flash 2000 chns o analyzer about 1 5 to 3 0 mg of dried sample with suitable protocol and kept in a desiccator to maintain minimum moisture at the time of analysis was used for the analysis standard protocol as per the specification of thermo scientific flash 2000 c h n s and o analyzer was followed the oxygen content in the sample was calculated by difference the cod analysis was conducted by using closed reflux spectrophotometric method cod vials are heated in hi 839800 cod reactor hanna instruments 2 4 uv visible spectrophotometric analysis the uv and visible light absorbance of the sample was measured by using shimadzu uv 2550 uv visible spectrophotometer the samples were diluted up to an appropriate dilution factor using ro water uv visible spectrophotometer calibrated by using ro water in both cuvettes 2 5 atr ftir analysis the atr ftir analysis attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was conducted on the shimadzu ir prestige 21 kyoto japan instrument coupled with the specac golden gate gs10500 atr assembly 3 result and discussion 3 1 proximate analysis of various dsw during the alcohol production process the dsw is generated from the bottom of the rectifier column shown in scheme 1 physically it s a dark brown liquid with a specific obnoxious smell of caramelized products the physiochemical characteristics of the dsw obtained from different distilleries are highly inconsistent it was reported that the properties of dsw produced are highly dependent on raw materials used for fermentation and the different aspects of ethanol production 41 the dsw samples were collected from different distilleries located at different locations throughout the india such as sample 1 western region western maharashtra sample 2 north region utter pradesh sample 3 northeast region uttarakhand sample 4 southeast region tamil nadu and sample 5 northwestern region punjab the samples were collected directly from running waste stream of dsw in a distillery and tested for their physicochemical properties as received the analysis of samples was conducted in three sets of reparative experiments and the mean value is indicated in graphs the proximate and physicochemical analysis of dsw obtained from various molasses based distilleries is shown table 1 and fig 1 it was observed that there is no significant variation in physical parameters such as ph colour and density but the remarkable variation was noted in the case of cod tds and ash content of the collected samples it is noted that cod ranges from 1 10 000 to 2 05 500 ppm tds ranges from 1 10 000 2 46 500 ppm conductivity ranges from 45 58 ms cm and ash content ranges from 2 4 5 it was noted that there is a significant variation in tss content from 0 5 3 5 and in conductivity from 45 58 ms cm the tss of dsw can be observed due to the presence of fermented cell cellulose microfibers salts and biomass slime while conductivity is because of dissolved inorganic salts the atr ftir spectra of dry tss collected from dsw shows the peaks at 1072 cm 1 s o 1408 cm 1 1544 cm 1 nh 1672 cm 1 c o 2926 cm 1 ch 2954 cm 1 ch and 3273 cm 1 oh which confirms the presence of proteins cellulose microfibers and biomass slime etc fig s1 esi while the atr ftir spectra of ash obtained from tss showed the absence of 1408 cm 1 1544 cm 1 nh 1672 cm 1 c o 2926 cm 1 ch 2954 cm 1 ch 3273 cm 1 oh and presence of peaks only at 1036 cm 1 613 cm 1 496 cm 1 which indicated the presence of inorganic matter only thus it can be speculated that the tss in dsw contains proteins cellulose and inorganic salts in the ethanol production process several distilleries have integrated decanters to separate sludge from dsw thus the percentage of tss depends on the use and efficiency of a decanter the dsw contains 3 4 tss before decanter but integration of decanter reduces the tss content significantly 0 5 furthermore it was noted that the dsw has a huge variation in cod and tds value the tds was estimated by evaporating water from dsw which is nothing but total dissolved solids organic inorganic present in dsw the variation in cod tds and ash contents depicted the diverse composition of dissolved solids in dsw in the distillery unit operations dsw is generated after the fermentation of molasses thus the steps before fermentation and molasses production are significantly contributing to variation in cod tds and ash content it is reported that the dark brown colour of dsw is because of maillard reaction products and caramels formed during the sugar cane juice concentration process 42 however the concentration of caramels and melanoidins can be dependent on a variation in unit operation during molasses generation ethanol fermentation b variety of cane and c operating parameters for sugar and ethanol production process etc in order to understand the presence of the dissolved carbonaceous compound the residue obtained after the evaporation of dsw is subjected to an elemental analysis the elemental analysis of tds obtained after the evaporation of water from dsw is depicted that there is a slight variation in elemental composition among all the tested samples shown fig s3 esi the atr ftir spectra of tds residue after water evaporation shown in fig 2 depicted the presence of 1039 cm 1 s o 1122 cm 1 ch 1402 cm 1 nh 1570 cm 1 nh 2927 cm 1 ch 3206 cm 1 oh which indicated the presence of acids alcohols and maillard reaction products etc the hplc analysis of subsequent samples was also conducted which depicted the presence of sugars acids and alcohol in dsw fig s5 esi however the overall cod of dsw is composed of carbonaceous compounds such as acids sugars alcohols and maillard reaction products while the overall tds is composed of carbonaceous compounds and inorganic salts of the tested samples there is a huge variation 2 28 4 4 in ash content was noted the ash in dsw is due to the presence of dissolved salts used during the cane juice clarification and fermentation process the amount of inorganic salt present as an ash in dsw may vary concerning the sugar industry and distillery it noted that the typical dsw contains 2 4 ash 3 2 volatile acids sugars and alcohol in dsw the dsw is the wastewater stream generated after fermentation of molasses with subsequent alcohol recovery thus there is a strong probability for the existence of volatile acids alcohols and unreacted sugars in the spent wash which contributes to the cod of dsw in order to check the concentration of volatile acids alcohols and unreacted sugars all the samples obtained from different distilleries are subjected to hplc analysis the hplc analysis was conducted in triplicate and the mean values are mentioned in figures the observed deviation was depicted in the graph it was noted that there is a 3 deviation in the percentage of organic acid and alcohol except sample 3 5 the quantitative analysis of volatile acids alcohols and sugars are shown fig 3 it was observed that all the spent wash samples obtained from different distilleries contains a sugars xylose glucose and sucrose b carboxylic acids formic acid fa acetic acid aa propionic acid pr acid and butyric acid but acid and c alcohol ethanol the concentration range for these components is very ambiguous which can be dependent on various factors of molasses fermentation and unit operations thus the variable percentage of carboxylic acids and alcohol can be attributed to the use of molasses from different locations molasses storage time and facility and distillery unit operations etc of the tested samples the concentration of sugars 0 3 1 0 carboxylic acids 0 80 10 0 and alcohol 0 07 0 48 was in variable range but the presence of carboxylic is found to be maximum the presence of sugars is due to unreacted molasses while the presence of alcohol is due to tipping of alcohol in the distillation process or fermentation of unreacted sugars in the spent wash the major constituent of dsw is carboxylic acids which can be carried forward from molasses or can be generated as side products during the alcohol fermentation process the formation of fa aa pr acid and but acid as a co product of alcohol fermentation is reported 43 44 3 3 overall cod convergence in dsw the cod of spent wash ranges from 1 10 000 to 2 05 500 ppm because of all dissolved organic components present in dsw in the present study it was observed that the overall cod of dsw is a cohesive combination of cod of a caramels melanoidins b biopolymers c acids sugars d alcohols others the cod contribution of sugars acids alcohols melanoidins and others in respective dsw samples is depicted fig 4 of the total cod significant contribution of cod is due to acids melanoidins and other biopolymers were noted the melanoidins and other biopolymers were formed in the maillard reaction during the heating process of sugar cane juice and these components are carry forwarded in molasses and then in dsw 45 46 the presence of dark brown colour of dsw is majorly due to maillard reaction and caramelized products in order to check the presence of these products uv visible spectra of respective samples were obtained fig s4 esi the uv visible spectra clearly depicted the absorbance maxima at λmax 280 nm and 400 nm which is indicative of maillard reaction products 47 the chemical structures of these products are still unknown because it depends on the initial concentration of reacting species temperature condition time and ph etc 48 the dark brown colour of dsw is an indicative for the presence of these components the strong dark brown colour of dsw resists the penetration of sunlight in the water which is hazardous for aquatic life 49 the analysis of dsw clearly depicted complexity in handling and its treatment but on the other hand dsw can be a chemical mine for the future due to the presence of commodity chemicals of the total organic tds it majorly composed of fa aa pr acid and but acid and ethanol as well fig 5 the estimated values of corresponding acid alcohol and others can be a variable as per the initial chemical composition of dsw in the present study it was noted that there is a 3 deviation in the percentage of organic acid and alcohol except sample 3 5 thus the estimated quantities of tpd is based on deviation and hplc analysis of different samples used in the present study however based on estimated values it can be speculated that an efficient strategy for the separation and isolation of these components significantly contributes to produce carboxylic acids from the waste the estimated potential of the distillery to produces commodity chemicals from 1000 klpd kl per day dsw is shown in fig 6 thus based on the average composition of respective components it can be speculated that the 1000 klpd dsw has the potential to produce 23 77 tpd tons per day of fa 1 10 tpd of aa 1 10 tpd pr acid 1 6 tpd of but acid and 2 7 tpd ethanol the estimated quantum of respective components clearly provides an idea for building a sustainable strategy to separate these chemicals form dsw and improve the economics of distillery 3 4 strategy for carboxylic acids recovery in the process of dsw disposal technologists preferred volume reduction before treatment of dsw which decreases the ultimate cost of effluent treatment several technological options are available in the market for volume reduction of dsw such as reverse osmosis ro and multiple effect evaporation mee etc but of the possible options mee is a widely used technique because of its low cost and high efficiency 50 during mee water gets evaporated along with low boiling components present in dsw the dsw components such as carboxylic acids and ethanol were evaporated with water and ended into the condensate shown in fig 7 the presence of these components was confirmed by hplc analysis the hplc analysis was conducted in triplicate and the mean value mentioned in the table it was noted that there is a 3 deviation in the percentage of carboxylic acids and cod the analysis of volatile components in mee condensate water obtained from different molasses based distilleries is shown in table 2 of the tested samples of mee condensate the diverse range of cod with variable ph the variable concentration of carboxylic acids acetic acid propionic and butyric acid and ethanol were noted however the presence of these components in mee condensate provides evidence for the evaporation of carboxylic acids and ethanol from dsw during the mee operation since the concentration of these components in mee condensate can be dependent on the performance of mee as well as their abundance in dsw the abundance of ethanol in mee condensate was also noted which can be observed be due to the presence of ethanol in dsw formed during the dsw storage through the fermentation of residual sugars resulted from previous unit operation thus the volatile carboxylic acid components of spent wash can be recovered by integrating the acid recovery system and used as an additional revenue source to the distillery industry fig 8 4 conclusion in conclusion the present manuscript unbolts the new horizons for sustainable management of dsw to explore its potential for the production of commodity chemicals to the best of our

14032,the natural rubber processing industry produces large amounts of wastewater the treatment of this wastewater to produce clean water has potential as an alternative source of process water for natural rubber production in this study we modified a polymeric membrane by nanoparticle blending to enhance its mechanical and separation properties in this study we processed natural rubber wastewater using polysulfone membranes doped with nano tio2 particles sem characterization shows that the nano tio2 loading caused enlargement of the finger like micro voids in the membrane sublayer and localization of the tio2 nanoparticles at the membrane surface the addition of nano tio2 also improved the hydrophilicity by reducing the water contact angle from 61 83 to 41 67 and the mechanical strength of the membrane from 4 1 7 2 mpa however at higher nano tio2 loadings 1 5 wt the tensile strength and hydrophilicity both decreased slightly due to its greater porosity and pore size the highest pwf 4 65 l m 2 h 1 was achieved using a membrane with 2 0 wt tio2 the best pollutant removal efficiency was exhibited by the psf tio2 1 0 wt membrane with tds cod nh3 and turbidity rejections of 14 03 87 88 88 79 and 99 respectively due to the improved hydrophilicity of the 0 5 wt tio2 loading membrane it achieved the lowest reversible fouling resistance rrf 6 90 1015 m 1 for natural rubber wastewater treatment the developed membranes have the potential for application in industrial rubber wastewater treatment to produce clean water for reuse keywords hybrid membrane nano tio2 natural rubber polysulfone wastewater 1 introduction developments in membrane separation technology have extended its application to many sectors including wastewater treatment 1 due to its high concentration of pollutants there are challenges associated with the membrane based treatment of wastewater generated by natural rubber processing proteins lipids carotene organic acids and inorganic minerals are the major components polluting rubber waste effluent 2 indonesia as the second largest natural rubber producer in the world generates a large amount of natural rubber wastewater each year the approximate volume of wastewater produced by the rubber industry in indonesia totals 300 400 m3 day 3 treating natural rubber wastewater is also essential for protecting the environment since this wastewater typically generates ammonia as a malodor by product although wastewater treatment offers the potential for recycling water resources the use of conventional techniques such as coagulation and activated sludge pond treatment are limited by their high treatment costs complex separation equipment low removal efficiency and secondary generation of pollutants 4 membrane filtration can be applied as a final treatment to achieve high separation efficiency but the fouling issue limits its use both technically and economically the consequence of fouling in membrane filtration is a significant flux decline during the filtration process membrane cleaning must be intensified to overcome the unfavorable result of the use of membranes with wastewater improving membrane surface characteristics such as hydrophilicity may mitigate membrane fouling however unfortunately most polymeric membranes that have excellent chemical mechanical and thermal strengths are slightly hydrophobic one such membrane is the polysulfone psf membrane which has excellent properties but is reported to be a hydrophobic polymer 5 many techniques have been developed to mitigate fouling by enhancing membrane surface hydrophilicity polymer blending 6 surface modification 7 uv irradiation 8 cross linking 9 and the incorporation of nano entities 10 have been reported as methods commonly used to enhance membrane characteristics the incorporation of nanomaterials has also become a matter of interest since these methods are also reported to enhance hydrophilicity structural characteristics and mechanical strength 11 inorganic nanoparticles that have been incorporated into polymer matrices include tio2 12 sio2 13 al2o3 14 zno 15 clay 16 zro2 17 graphene 18 and functionalized metal oxides 10 titanium dioxide tio2 is widely used in nanoparticles for the fabrication of nanohybrid membranes due to its unique properties such as strong hydrophilicity chemical stability commercial availability and photocatalytic behavior the incorporation of tio2 into psf membranes is expected to enhance their hydrophilicity and macro voids structure sirinupong et al 19 reported that the incorporation of tio2 increased the hydrophilicity and roughness of the psf membrane surface in their study a dope solution containing tio2 caused the membrane to develop extended finger like voids this membrane was applied in the rejection of salt and the authors found the incorporation of tio2 nanoparticles to enhance salt rejection jyothi et al 20 fabricated a nanocomposite psf membrane by incorporating hybridized tio2 nanoparticles and achieved a bifunctional efficacy of metal ion reduction and separation the authors reported that the membrane was able to remove cr iv with high efficiency however there are no reports of the influence of other pollutants on cr removal uv irradiation on a psf tio2 membrane was also performed by jyothi et al 21 where the uv irradiation activated the photocatalytic behavior of tio2 which enhanced the rejection of cr as well as the flux xu et al 22 developed a nanocomposite psf membrane by the incorporation of tio2 and found that the blending of n doped go and tio2 in membrane polymers increased the photodecomposition efficiency toward methylene blue ayaru and ahn 23 also fabricated a tio2 incorporated pes membrane to mitigate fouling this nanoparticle blended membrane exhibited higher water flux and lowered irreversible resistance than a neat membrane overall hybrid membranes were found to exhibit high hydrophilicity permeability and anti fouling performances in bovine serum albumin filtration although the incorporation of tio2 nanoparticles in membrane fabrication for the mitigation of membrane fouling has been reported in the literature there have been no reports regarding original wastewater sample treatment in which the complexity of the pollutant influences the membrane performance in this study we used original natural wastewater as the feed wastewater we fabricated psf tio2 nanohybrid membranes and made a detailed investigation of their characteristics including the permeate flux pollutant rejection and anti fouling behavior the stability of the membrane in terms of flux recovery after membrane cleaning are evaluated in this study the treated water was analyzed for potential reuse purposes moreover we considered the water conservation process after membrane application 2 experiments 2 1 materials polysulfone udel p 1700 nt was purchased from solvay advanced material usa n methyl pyrrolidone nmp and polyethylene glycol peg 4000 were purchased from merck and used as a solvent and pore former respectively tio2 nanoparticles mean particle size 322 25 nm as shown in fig 1 were supplied by nano center indonesia we used distilled water throughout the experiment we obtained natural rubber wastewater effluent secondary treatment discharge from ptpn vii bengkulu indonesia as feed wastewater with the characteristics as shown in table 1 2 2 fabrication of psf tio2 nanohybrid membranes neat psf and nanohybrid psf tio2 membranes were fabricated via dry wet phase inversion as reported in previous work 24 a casting dope solution was made containing 19 wt psf 2 wt peg as the pore former and various concentrations of tio2 nanoparticles in an nmp solvent the formulations of which are shown in table 2 an appropriate amount of tio2 nanoparticles dried at 105 c for 5 h was dissolved in nmp solvent and then ultrasonicated for 60 min to achieve a stable and homogeneous suspension then the considered amounts of psf and peg were added to the nanoparticle suspension and stirred for 8 h until a homogeneous suspension was obtained the dope solution was then manually cast onto a clean glass plate at a thickness of 150 μm with a knife the casted film was allowed to dry for 60 s and was then immediately soaked in a non solvent bath at room temperature 28 30 c after complete phase separation the membranes were stored in distilled water for 24 h to allow the solvent and other water soluble components to be completely leached from the membrane the membrane was then dried in an oven at 50 c for 24 h 2 3 characterization procedures 2 3 1 morphology characterization using scanning electron microscopy sem to investigate the morphologies of both surface and cross sectional images we used sem jeol series jsm 6510 la japan to scan the membrane surface we placed a membrane sample on a sample holder and then sputter coated it with gold the sample was then examined by sem at 10 000x and 20 000x magnifications in the cross sectional scanning we immersed a membrane sample in liquid nitrogen and fractured it with tweezers the membrane was then placed on a sample holder and sputter coated with gold the morphology of the membrane was examined at 1 000x and 5 000x magnifications with an applied voltage of 20 kv 2 3 2 x ray diffraction xrd of nanohybrid membranes in fabricating the nanohybrid membranes membrane immersion in a non solvent during the phase inversion process is a critical step since the nanoparticles may leach out from the polymer matrix to verify the presence of nanoparticles in the membrane matrix we performed xrd analysis of the neat psf and nanohybrid psf membranes using an x ray diffractometer panalytical xrd x pert3 powder dy 5367 uk with a monochromatic cu kα radiation source at 300 ma 400 kv with 2θ range from 10 to 80 we identified the presence of the tio2 nanoparticles by identifying the typical peaks of tio2 particles 2 3 3 contact angle measurements to determine the surface hydrophilicity of the nanohybrid membranes we measured the water contact angles of the surface using an anglemeter race anglemeter japan contact angle measurements were performed using the sessile drop method at constant temperature 25 c using deionized water as the probe liquid we added a specific volume of water dropwise onto the membrane surface when the water droplet became stable after 30 s the measurement was made during a 4 min observation to minimize measurement error we chose from five to ten random dropping spots on the membrane surface to measure the contact angle under the same conditions 2 3 4 mechanical strength evaluation the mechanical strengths of the membranes were evaluated using a material testing machine uts h001 china to determine their tensile stress strength and elongation break values stress strain measurements were applied on 5 cm 1 cm 100 μm membrane samples at a stretching rate of 20 mm min 1 we recorded the applied force per unit area and the elongation of the membrane at the point of the material break as the tensile strength and elongation break values respectively the obtained data were based on an average of three sample measurements 2 3 5 membrane porosity and average pore radius the porosity and pore size of membranes are difficult to measure directly as reported by li et al 25 and hong and he 26 the porosity can instead be estimated using the dry wet gravimetric method to do so we immersed a piece of membrane in deionized water for 24 h then wiped the wet membrane surface with cleaning paper the wiped membrane was then weighed and dried at 60 c and weighed again to obtain the dry membrane weight the porosity of the membrane was determined using eq 1 as follows 1 ε w i w 0 ρ w a δ 100 where ε is the porosity of the membrane wi and w0 are the weights of the wet and dry membranes g respectively ρw is the density of pure water at 25 c 0 997 g cm 3 a is the effective area of the membrane cm2 and δ is the membrane thickness cm we determined the average pore size by the filtration velocity method using the guerout elford ferry formula the pore size rm can be calculated using eq 2 as follows 2 r m 2 9 1 75 ε 8 η l q ε a δ p where η is the viscosity of the pure water 8 9 10 4 pa s l is the membrane thickness m q is the volume of the permeate per unit of time m3 s 1 and δp is the trans membrane pressure pa 2 4 permeate flux and pollutant rejection to measure the permeate fluxes of pure water and original rubber wastewater we used a lab scale cross flow membrane filtration cell with an effective area of 15 90 cm2 a schematic diagram of the filtration process is shown in fig 2 the fabricated membrane was mounted in the membrane cell and then compacted using deionized water at 5 bar for 30 min until reaching a steady permeate flux we recorded the pure water permeate at pressures from 2 bar to 8 bar for the rubber wastewater filtration after the membrane had been compacted using deionized water wastewater was introduced to the membrane at 5 bar and permeate water was collected over a period of time the pure water flux jw and wastewater permeate flux jww were calculated using eq 3 as follows 3 j w o r j w w v i a δ t where vi is the volume of permeate water at a certain period of time l a is the effective area of the membrane m2 and δt is the permeate collection time h jw and jww are the permeate fluxes of pure water and wastewater l m 2 h 1 respectively to evaluate the membrane s performance in removing pollutants from the rubber wastewater we performed a rejection analysis by measuring wastewater pollutant parameters such as the total dissolved solids tds turbidity ammonia content and chemical oxygen demand cod in both the feed and permeate wastewaters the pollutant rejection was determined using eq 4 as follows 4 r i 1 c p i c f i 100 where ri is the rejection efficiency with respect to a certain pollutant and cpi and cfi are the concentrations of pollutants in the permeate and feed wastewater respectively 2 5 fouling resistance analysis a decrease in the permeate flux during membrane separation is caused by a combination of reversible and irreversible fouling the presence of foulant in the membrane can be investigated by evaluating the fouling resistance using the pure water permeation method we determined the resistances of the intrinsic membrane rm reversible fouling rrf and irreversible fouling rif using a series model derived from darcy s equation to evaluate intrinsic membrane resistance we performed a pure water permeation test using a clean membrane irreversible fouling resistance was evaluated by removing the foulant deposited on the membrane to do so the fouled membrane was carefully rinsed using deionized water and then soaked in distilled water for 24 h we determined the rm rif and rrf values using eqs 5 7 respectively 27 28 5 r m δ p μ j 0 6 r

the viscosity of the pure water pa s and δp is the trans membrane pressure pa 3 results and discussion 3 1 membrane surface and cross sectional morphologies the images from sem analysis were useful to characterize the surface and cross section morphology of the nanohybrid psf tio2 membranes fig 3 shows eight sem images of membrane surface and cross section of neat psf and psf tio2 nanohybrid membranes the membrane surface was dense and no dark spot that indicates the presence of the void defect the nano tio2 particles were observed spreading on the membrane surface some of the particles are assembled however the agglomerates aren t formed for membrane with tio2 concentration of 0 5 1 0 wt it indicates that nano tio2 is well mixed homogenously during dope solution preparation at the magnification of 20 000x the pores of the membrane could not be observed confirming that the pores were in the nano scale the nano gaps between nano particles and the polymer was not found it seems that nano tio2 has a good interaction behavior with psf polymer and they are attached to each other however at a higher concentration of tio2 2 wt nanoparticles agglomeration was found with unselective nanogaps in general the fabricated membranes have an asymmetric structure consisting of a dense skin layer and a porous sublayer that has finger like void morphology this kind of structure is generally found in the membrane that is produced using the nips method 29 however the neat psf cross section image shows a uniformly sponge like structure it could be due to the rheological properties of the casting solution which affects the demixing rate during the phase inversion process the finger like voids of the psf tio2 membrane are larger with the increasing of tio2 loading concentration the possible answer is the addition of nano tio2 enhances the dope solution hydrophilicity since it has a strong hydrophilic nature that leads to faster solvent diffusion during phase inversion the finger like micro void structure extends from the middle to the bottom of the membrane as shown in fig 3 the nano tio2 distribution is localized on the surface of the membrane this may be caused by mobile particles during the demixing process when the polymer solution is in contact with non solvent during this process there is a migration of solvents from the polymer solution phase to the non solvent phase the solvent movement out of the polymer matrix is replaced by non solvent which depresses the tio2 nanoparticles towards the surface this condition is advantageous in membrane fabrication because according to a previous study report the addition of nanoparticles is known to increase the hydrophilicity of membrane surfaces significantly 30 more hydrophilic membranes have been reported to improve flux performance and minimize membrane fouling problems 31 during filtration water molecules pass through the membrane via non clogged pores created by the interspace between nano tio2 particles and polymer thus enhance the permeate flux membrane surface hydrophilicity can be improved by the addition of hydrophilic nanoparticles however the over loading of nanoparticles may initiate the agglomerate formation that significantly reduces the membrane separation performance 3 2 x ray diffraction analysis the phase inversion process when using a non solvent is a critical point during nanohybrid membrane fabrication incorporated nanoparticles may leach out of the polymer matrix due to their affinity with water as a non solvent to verify the presence of nanoparticles in the membrane matrix we performed an xrd analysis typically xrd is used to identify changes in the crystallinity of material but apart from its function in crystalline phase identification this non destructive analysis can also be used to identify the presence of materials therefore we examined the xrd patterns of neat psf tio2 nanoparticle powder and nanohybrid psf tio2 to determine the presence of tio2 nanoparticles in the psf matrix fig 4 shows the xrd diffraction patterns of neat psf tio2 nanoparticles and the nanohybrid membrane of psf tio2 in which we can see that psf is a glassy polymer with an amorphous phase and no crystalline peak the xrd patterns of tio2 powder shows a crystalline phase with four characteristic crystalline peaks at 2θs of 27 43 36 09 41 25 and 54 31 this results in accordance with previous studies reported by wu et al 32 we used the nanohybrid membrane with the lowest tio2 nanoparticle loading 0 5 wt as a sample to show that the tio2 and psf are firmly attached the xrd patterns of the nanohybrid membrane shown in fig 2 also have four crystalline peaks that correspond to the tio2 crystalline peaks however these peaks are weakly dispersed on the amorphous psf membrane with careful observation we find that the crystalline peaks in the nanohybrid membrane exhibit a slight shift with the peaks at 27 66 36 33 44 55 and 54 59 this indicates that there may have been an interaction between the tio2 nanoparticle and psf polymer the xrd analysis revealed that the tio2 nanoparticles in the dope solution had not leached out during the phase inversion process and the nanoparticles had been distributed throughout the membrane matrix to evaluate the nanoparticles leaching from the psf membrane a spent nanohybrid membrane from rubber wastewater filtration test was analyzed using xrd the diffraction profile shows that the used nanohybrid membrane has different peaks than the clean nanohybrid membrane there are some addition sharp peaks in the range of 2θ 15 to 20 these peaks might come from the salt that adsorbed on the membrane the typical peaks of tio2 nanoparticles were also found among the amorphous signal that indicates the nanoparticles were well attached within the psf matrix and were not leached during the filtration process 3 3 membranes porosity and pore analysis the structural properties of the membrane are important to identify to obtain information about membrane separation and permeability to characterize the membrane structure we measured its porosity thickness and mean pore size table 3 shows the structural properties of the fabricated membranes at various concentrations of tio2 nanoparticles as shown in table 3 the thickness of the membranes varied with the concentration of tio2 particles the neat psf membrane had a thickness of 55 μm and with the addition of 0 5 wt and 1 0 wt tio2 nanoparticles this thickness slightly increased to 60 μm and 65 μm respectively during the film casting process the dope solution was cast at a thickness of 150 μm and the membrane thickness reduced due to solvent demixing and water loss during the drying process the presence of nanoparticles distributed throughout the whole of the membrane matrix serves to maintain the membrane structure however concentrations greater than 1 0 wt showed similar thicknesses of 65 μm a possible reason for this is that at higher nanoparticle concentrations the volume fraction of psf in the nanohybrid membrane decreases according to table 3 with an increase of nanoparticle concentration i e the addition of up to 1 0 wt tio2 the porosity of the membranes increased from 36 to 43 however at higher concentrations more than 1 0 wt the membrane porosity slightly declines this alteration in the membrane porosity due to nanoparticle loading is attributed to the increasing hydrophilicity of the dope solution tio2 nanoparticles are well known to be strongly hydrophilic materials that can enhance the dope solution hydrophilicity with higher hydrophilicity the solvent demixing during phase inversion occurs more quickly the rapid demixing of the solvent from the polymer phase creates larger micropores in the intermediate layer as shown in the sem images fig 1 at the higher concentrations 1 0 wt of tio2 the dope solution becomes more viscous this accords with a previous study in which the addition of some inorganic nanoparticles significantly increased the dope solution viscosity due to the high surface area and high surface energy of the nanoparticles 26 the viscosity of the dope solution affects the coagulation rate due to the demixing rate of the solvent in a non solvent immersion with a viscous dope solution the exchange rate between the solvent and non solvent is slower the consequence of the slow demixing process is lower membrane porosity based on these results we can conclude that the addition of nanoparticles to the dope solution influenced its hydrophilicity and viscosity at a relatively low concentration of nanoparticles the hydrophilicity enhancement effect dominates during phase inversion whereas at a high nanoparticle concentration the viscosity of the dope solution increases similarly the mean pore size radius increases with the addition of tio2 nanoparticles from 7 65 nm to 10 10 nm with a tio2 loading of 1 5 wt at a 2 wt tio2 loading the pore size of the membrane decreases slightly to 9 87 nm this could be due to the fact that the incorporation of tio2 nanoparticles provided nanogaps between the nanoparticle surfaces and the psf matrix such that when overloading of the nanoparticles occurred the nanoparticles blocked the pores 3 4 water contact angle and pwf one of the most significant membrane properties that strongly affect membrane performance and anti fouling behavior is surface hydrophilicity the hydrophilicity of a membrane surface can be determined by measuring the water contact angle a membrane with a contact angle of less than 90 is considered to be hydrophilic and a smaller water contact angle as shown in fig 5 indicates that the membrane is more hydrophilic the static water contact angle of the nanohybrid psf tio2 membrane decreased when the amount of tio2 nanoparticles increased we attribute this hydrophilicity enhancement of the membrane surface to the addition of tio2 nanoparticles which are well known to be strongly hydrophilic as shown in fig 5 the neat psf membrane is slightly hydrophobic with a water contact angle of 61 83 with the addition of 0 5 wt tio2 the contact angle declined to 48 57 and this decline continued until the addition of 1 5 wt tio2 when the contact angle was 41 67 the strong affinity of tio2 nanoparticles with water caused the nanoparticles to migrate toward the top layer of the membrane during the phase inversion process and reduce the interface energy 33 however the addition of more than 1 5 wt tio2 nanoparticles slightly increased the water contact angle this is probably due to the nanoparticle s self assembling into agglomerates which increased the roughness of the membrane surface based on our sem images we confirmed that membrane surfaces at higher concentrations exhibit a concentrated distribution of nanoparticles in the top layer of the membrane similar results have been reported for nano sized zno and iron oxide in pes membranes 13 34 from the results of this study we can conclude that the addition of tio2 nanoparticles significantly enhances the hydrophilicity of the membrane surface but the addition of more than a certain amount of tio2 in this study 1 5 wt increases the membrane roughness due to agglomeration by taking advantage of this improvement in hydrophilicity through tio2 loading its application can mitigate fouling in rubber wastewater treatment the structural properties of membranes include porosity mean pore size membrane thickness the skin layer sublayer structure and hydrophilicity from which the permeation performance of membranes can be determined from the above discussion we know that the addition of tio2 nanoparticles to a psf membrane significantly affects its structural properties therefore the hydrophilicity enhancement and change in membrane morphology may also influence the pwf fig 6 shows the effect on the pw fof the addition of nano tio2 particles generally the pwf profile increases almost linearly with the concentration of tio2 loading the neat psf has the lowest pwf and reaches its highest pwf value when the concentration of tio2 is 2 0 wt at a relatively low concentration of tio2 0 5 1 0 wt the pwf enhancement is attributed to the improvement in membrane porosity and the wide distribution of nanoparticles at high concentrations of tio2 1 5 2 0 wt agglomerations of nanoparticles occur which creates larger surface pores that lead to low membrane resistance the low pwf value bellow 5 l m 2 h 1 in this study could be due to the low tmp during filtration the membranes in this study are considered as nanofiltration where the suitable pressure is in the range of 5 25 bars during filtration process the tmp was maintained at 5 bars thus the pwf values were relatively low to obtained higher pwf value higher tmp should be applied 3 5 evaluation of membrane mechanical strength the mechanical strength of a membrane determines its durability when it is used in a filtration process therefore the evaluation of mechanical strength in membrane fabrication is an important task fig 7 shows the tensile strength and elongation break values of fabricated membranes in the figure we can see that as the concentration of tio2 increased from 0 wt to 2 0 wt both the tensile strength and elongation break values increased from 4 1 mpa to 5 7 mpa and from 4 20 to 15 50 respectively this indicates that the incorporation of tio2 nanoparticles improved the force load of the membrane whereby the force applied to the membrane was distributed to the polymer and nanoparticles which means that the membrane doesn t break as easily with the application of higher force 35 another possible reason for the increased mechanical strength is the interaction between the tio2 nanoparticles and psf whereby the nanoparticles act as a linking agent to connect the polymer chain to the membrane and increase its rigidity 25 however the addition of more than 1 0 wt tio2 decreases the tensile strength a possible reason for this is the localized self assembly of the nanoparticles in the body of the membrane the weak cohesive force between the nanoparticles in agglomerates causes a disconnection between the polymer chains the addition of nanoparticles in nanohybrid membrane fabrication should be maintained at a certain concentration in this study 1 5 wt to maintain the adhesive bond between the tio2 particles and psf and thereby improve the mechanical strength of the membrane 3 6 membrane filtration performance on wastewater 3 6 1 permeate flux a permeation test using pure water provided insufficient data regarding the filtration performance of a membrane a filtration test must be performed using the original rubber wastewater to evaluate the ability of the membrane to remove complex pollutants this test also provides information for producing an actual permeate flux profile for rubber wastewater treatment fig 6 shows the normalized and actual flux profiles for rubber wastewater filtration using fabricated membranes with various tio2 concentrations the flux profiles of all the membranes exhibit a sharp decline early in the filtration process this could be due to the deposition of reversible fouling on the membrane surface after a period of time the flux profiles exhibit a pseudo steady state with a slight decline in the permeate flux due to the high concentration of organic materials in the rubber wastewater this phenomenon is due to the deposition of the absorbed foulant within the membrane in fig 8 the flux profile of neat psf has the lowest permeate flux and the sharpest flux decline relative to the nanohybrid membrane this is due to the poor hydrophilicity of the neat psf membrane which causes the deposition of foulant on the membrane no pseudo steady state occurs in the normalized flux of the neat psf membrane which means that there is a continuous deposition of absorbed foulant the nanohybrid membranes with tio2 loadings of 1 5 wt and 2 0 wt show sharp declines in their normalized flux despite their high actual permeate fluxes the reason for this may be that the surface morphologies of the membranes with tio2 loadings greater than 1 5 wt have rougher membrane surfaces which leads to the deposition of reversible fouling on the membrane surface 36 the addition of tio2 loadings between 0 5 wt and 1 0 wt however result in moderate permeate fluxes and slight flux declines this reveals that well blended nanoparticles in a nanohybrid membrane with minimal agglomeration enhance the hydrophilicity of the membrane surface the morphology of the membrane sublayer and the roughness of the lower membrane hence its permeate flux is improved and the degree of fouling is mitigated 3 6 2 pollutant removal efficiency the rejection of pollutants in wastewater varies with the type of compound molecule or particle rejection in membrane separation may occur based on size exclusion charge exclusion polarity difference solubility properties or affinity difference based on the rejection rate for each component shown in fig 9 and our characterization of the structural properties we know that the membranes in this study are nanofiltration membranes for which size exclusion charge exclusion and affinity difference between the membrane material and pollutant components play important roles in determining the separation performance we found the tds rejection rates to be lowest for all types of nanohybrid membranes which can be explained by the fact that the pores of this membrane are nanoscale in size the membranes may thus be able to reject multivalent ions but perform less well in rejecting monovalent ions with this fact it can be assumed that the main component in tds is monovalent ions the highest tds rejection rate of 14 03 was achieved by the membrane with a 1 0 wt tio2 loading the rejection rates of cod and nh3 for all membranes were relatively high ranging from 54 to 87 and from 76 to 89 respectively the higher rejection rates for cod and nh3 than tds can be explained by the size exclusion principle as cod organic compounds are larger than the most ions so they experience higher rejection rates for nh3 the presence of nh3 in water occurs in the equilibrium state of ammonium ions and soluble ammonia n h 3 h 2 o n h 4 o h the introduction of tio2 nanoparticles in a zwitterionic or neutral material causes the surface charge to become positive 37 hence the ammonium ion is excluded based on its similar charge turbidity rejection exhibited the highest efficiency of 99 the turbidity rejection measure in wastewater indicates the amount of micro sized particles that were effectively removed using the nanofiltration membrane 38 we observed a similar trend in the rejection profiles of all the pollutants with the highest rejection achieved when the tio2 loading was 1 0 wt at this point the removal efficiencies of tds cod nh3 and turbidity were 14 03 87 88 88 79 and 99 respectively this indicates that the addition of tio2 nanoparticles significantly enhanced pollutant removal efficiency however when the tio2 loading was greater than 1 0 wt the removal efficiencies of all the components slightly declined a possible reason for this is the formation of nanoparticle agglomerates in which unselective nanogaps are created this reasoning is also supported by our previous finding that the incorporation of high concentrations of tio2 produces membranes with larger pore sizes 3 7 analysis of fouling resistance next we evaluated the anti fouling properties of the membranes based on their fouling resistances during pure water permeation of fouled membranes resistance may occur due to the membrane s intrinsic resistance and absorbed irreversible foulant internal fouling or cake formation reversible fouling deposition in table 4 the psf membrane has the highest rm value 13 75 1016 m 1 relative to the nanohybrid membrane this is due to the higher porosity of the nanohybrid membrane and the enhanced hydrophilicity of the membrane surface such that the water more easily permeates the membrane barrier in the table we can see that the rm value decreases with increases in the tio2 concentration as this yields larger pore sizes and porosities the lowest irreversible fouling resistance rir which is related to the absorbed foulant compounds in the membrane was achieved by psf tio2 2 0 wt 1 46 1016 m 1 this occurs due to the strong affinity between the foulant compounds and the membrane matrix according to the rir results listed in table 4 the foulant was most highly absorbed by the psf polymer so the addition of tio2 decreases the amount of absorbed foulant since it decreases the mass fraction of the polymer in the membrane the reversible fouling resistance is related to the cake formation on the membrane surface during filtration with the rrf of pes tio2 0 5 wt showing the lowest resistance 6 9 1015 m 1 cake formation strongly depends on the membrane hydrophilicity and membrane surface roughness 39 as discussed in the previous section the formation of self assembled nanoparticle agglomerates caused an increase in the membrane surface roughness due to the higher hydrophilicity and lower membrane surface roughness of the psf tio2 0 5 wt nanohybrid membrane it showed the lowest rrf value in addition the lowest total resistance rt was exhibited by the nanohybrid membrane with 2 0 wt tio2 loading this result accords with the findings of previous studies that at higher loading concentrations of nanofillers the total resistance of a membrane decreases 40 3 8 permeate water evaluation and its potential for recycling purpose large amounts of water are needed to process natural rubber without any steps taken to recycle the used water this process becomes increasingly uneconomical and wasteful of clean water conventional processing cannot achieve the processed water quality necessary to meet the required standards in this study we evaluated the quality of treated wastewater for which we used a psf tio2 nanohybrid membrane and we compared it against the clean water quality standards established by the indonesian ministry of health for agro industries 41 table 5 lists the permeate quality and clean water quality standards for agro industries as shown in the table almost all the parameters meet the quality standards but the cod and nh3 values remain still slightly above the permitted standards processing wastewater using this process has the potential for use in recycling water from natural rubber production although the process must be improved to increase the cod and ammonia rejection rates based on this research and given the average wastewater quantity of 300 m3 day produced by the indonesian rubber industry the required effective membrane area is about 2500 m2 3 9 flux recovery after membrane cleaning permeate water flux during wastewater filtration decreased as function of time due to deposition of pollutant on the membrane membrane cleaning is required to recover the permeate flux flux recovery of the membrane after cleaning via backwashing was evaluated in this study the permeate flux profile after backwashing was shown in fig 10 overall the flux obtained from nanohybrid membranes were higher than flux from neat psf membrane the flux significantly declined in the initial filtration where total flux drops of neat psf psf tio2 1 0 wt and psf tio2 1 5 wt were 77 51 and 44 respectively after 150 min of experimental time after backwashing the flux recovery of neat psf psf tio2 1 0 wt psf tio2 1 5 wt were 61 89 and 91 respectively the flux recovery of the nanohybrid membranes are higher than neat psf due to the fouling behavior of the membrane based on resistance evaluation table 5 neat psf membrane h showed higher irreversible foulant resistance than that of nanohybrid membrane this high irreversible resistance is indicating that adsorbed foulant in neat psf membrane is higher since the backwashing only remove reversible foulant on the membrane surface the nanohybrid membranes have better flux recovery the second backwashing step showed the flux recovery of the neat psf psf tio2 1 0 wt and psf tio2 1 5 wt were 67 62 42 in a sequential backwashing procedure flux recovery decreases with the number of backwashing process 4 conclusion in this study we prepared nanohybrid membranes via a dry wet phase inversion process and then introduced various amounts of tio2 nanoparticles to a psf dope solution to improve the structural properties of the nanohybrid membranes the addition of a tio2 nanofiller significantly changed the membrane morphologies xrd analysis revealed a strong interaction between tio2 nanoparticles and the psf polymer the addition of tio2 also controlled the top layer and sublayer of the asymmetric membrane with the formation of larger finger like pores the addition of a small amount of tio2 in the dope solution also resulted in greater porosity and pore size however increasing the amount of tio2 nanoparticles from 1 5 wt to 2 0 wt resulted in slight decreases in the porosity and pore size due to the increased viscosity of the dope solution which affects the solvent exchange rate during phase inversion we found the hydrophilicity of the membrane surface to be enhanced by introducing tio2 nanoparticles with the contact angle decreasing from 61 83 to 41 67 when the nanofiller loading was increased the contact angle increased to 43 50 due to the formation of agglomerates which increased the membrane surface roughness the presence of tio2 nanoparticles also improved the mechanical strength of the psf membranes the highest pwf 4 65 l m 2 h 1 was achieved by the membrane with 2 0 wt tio2 loading due to its higher porosity and pore size the best pollutant removal efficiency was exhibited by the psf tio2 1 0 wt membrane with tds cod nh3 and turbidity removal rates reaching 14 03 87 88 88 79 and 99 respectively the improved hydrophilicity of the 0 5 wt tio2 loading membrane led to the lowest reversible fouling resistance rrf 6 90 1015 m 1 for natural rubber wastewater treatment

14032,the natural rubber processing industry produces large amounts of wastewater the treatment of this wastewater to produce clean water has potential as an alternative source of process water for natural rubber production in this study we modified a polymeric membrane by nanoparticle blending to enhance its mechanical and separation properties in this study we processed natural rubber wastewater using polysulfone membranes doped with nano tio2 particles sem characterization shows that the nano tio2 loading caused enlargement of the finger like micro voids in the membrane sublayer and localization of the tio2 nanoparticles at the membrane surface the addition of nano tio2 also improved the hydrophilicity by reducing the water contact angle from 61 83 to 41 67 and the mechanical strength of the membrane from 4 1 7 2 mpa however at higher nano tio2 loadings 1 5 wt the tensile strength and hydrophilicity both decreased slightly due to its greater porosity and pore size the highest pwf 4 65 l m 2 h 1 was achieved using a membrane with 2 0 wt tio2 the best pollutant removal efficiency was exhibited by the psf tio2 1 0 wt membrane with tds cod nh3 and turbidity rejections of 14 03 87 88 88 79 and 99 respectively due to the improved hydrophilicity of the 0 5 wt tio2 loading membrane it achieved the lowest reversible fouling resistance rrf 6 90 1015 m 1 for natural rubber wastewater treatment the developed membranes have the potential for application in industrial rubber wastewater treatment to produce clean water for reuse keywords hybrid membrane nano tio2 natural rubber polysulfone wastewater 1 introduction developments in membrane separation technology have extended its application to many sectors including wastewater treatment 1 due to its high concentration of pollutants there are challenges associated with the membrane based treatment of wastewater generated by natural rubber processing proteins lipids carotene organic acids and inorganic minerals are the major components polluting rubber waste effluent 2 indonesia as the second largest natural rubber producer in the world generates a large amount of natural rubber wastewater each year the approximate volume of wastewater produced by the rubber industry in indonesia totals 300 400 m3 day 3 treating natural rubber wastewater is also essential for protecting the environment since this wastewater typically generates ammonia as a malodor by product although wastewater treatment offers the potential for recycling water resources the use of conventional techniques such as coagulation and activated sludge pond treatment are limited by their high treatment costs complex separation equipment low removal efficiency and secondary generation of pollutants 4 membrane filtration can be applied as a final treatment to achieve high separation efficiency but the fouling issue limits its use both technically and economically the consequence of fouling in membrane filtration is a significant flux decline during the filtration process membrane cleaning must be intensified to overcome the unfavorable result of the use of membranes with wastewater improving membrane surface characteristics such as hydrophilicity may mitigate membrane fouling however unfortunately most polymeric membranes that have excellent chemical mechanical and thermal strengths are slightly hydrophobic one such membrane is the polysulfone psf membrane which has excellent properties but is reported to be a hydrophobic polymer 5 many techniques have been developed to mitigate fouling by enhancing membrane surface hydrophilicity polymer blending 6 surface modification 7 uv irradiation 8 cross linking 9 and the incorporation of nano entities 10 have been reported as methods commonly used to enhance membrane characteristics the incorporation of nanomaterials has also become a matter of interest since these methods are also reported to enhance hydrophilicity structural characteristics and mechanical strength 11 inorganic nanoparticles that have been incorporated into polymer matrices include tio2 12 sio2 13 al2o3 14 zno 15 clay 16 zro2 17 graphene 18 and functionalized metal oxides 10 titanium dioxide tio2 is widely used in nanoparticles for the fabrication of nanohybrid membranes due to its unique properties such as strong hydrophilicity chemical stability commercial availability and photocatalytic behavior the incorporation of tio2 into psf membranes is expected to enhance their hydrophilicity and macro voids structure sirinupong et al 19 reported that the incorporation of tio2 increased the hydrophilicity and roughness of the psf membrane surface in their study a dope solution containing tio2 caused the membrane to develop extended finger like voids this membrane was applied in the rejection of salt and the authors found the incorporation of tio2 nanoparticles to enhance salt rejection jyothi et al 20 fabricated a nanocomposite psf membrane by incorporating hybridized tio2 nanoparticles and achieved a bifunctional efficacy of metal ion reduction and separation the authors reported that the membrane was able to remove cr iv with high efficiency however there are no reports of the influence of other pollutants on cr removal uv irradiation on a psf tio2 membrane was also performed by jyothi et al 21 where the uv irradiation activated the photocatalytic behavior of tio2 which enhanced the rejection of cr as well as the flux xu et al 22 developed a nanocomposite psf membrane by the incorporation of tio2 and found that the blending of n doped go and tio2 in membrane polymers increased the photodecomposition efficiency toward methylene blue ayaru and ahn 23 also fabricated a tio2 incorporated pes membrane to mitigate fouling this nanoparticle blended membrane exhibited higher water flux and lowered irreversible resistance than a neat membrane overall hybrid membranes were found to exhibit high hydrophilicity permeability and anti fouling performances in bovine serum albumin filtration although the incorporation of tio2 nanoparticles in membrane fabrication for the mitigation of membrane fouling has been reported in the literature there have been no reports regarding original wastewater sample treatment in which the complexity of the pollutant influences the membrane performance in this study we used original natural wastewater as the feed wastewater we fabricated psf tio2 nanohybrid membranes and made a detailed investigation of their characteristics including the permeate flux pollutant rejection and anti fouling behavior the stability of the membrane in terms of flux recovery after membrane cleaning are evaluated in this study the treated water was analyzed for potential reuse purposes moreover we considered the water conservation process after membrane application 2 experiments 2 1 materials polysulfone udel p 1700 nt was purchased from solvay advanced material usa n methyl pyrrolidone nmp and polyethylene glycol peg 4000 were purchased from merck and used as a solvent and pore former respectively tio2 nanoparticles mean particle size 322 25 nm as shown in fig 1

as feed wastewater with the characteristics as shown in table 1 2 2 fabrication of psf tio2 nanohybrid membranes neat psf and nanohybrid psf tio2 membranes were fabricated via dry wet phase inversion as reported in previous work 24 a casting dope solution was made containing 19 wt psf 2 wt peg as the pore former and various concentrations of tio2 nanoparticles in an nmp solvent the formulations of which are shown in table 2 an appropriate amount of tio2 nanoparticles dried at 105 c for 5 h was dissolved in nmp solvent and then ultrasonicated for 60 min to achieve a stable and homogeneous suspension then the considered amounts of psf and peg were added to the nanoparticle suspension and stirred for 8 h until a homogeneous suspension was obtained the dope solution was then manually cast onto a clean glass plate at a thickness of 150 μm with a knife the casted film was allowed to dry for 60 s and was then immediately soaked in a non solvent bath at room temperature 28 30 c after complete phase separation the membranes were stored in distilled water for 24 h to allow the solvent and other water soluble components to be completely leached from the membrane the membrane was then dried in an oven at 50 c for 24 h 2 3 characterization procedures 2 3 1 morphology characterization using scanning electron microscopy sem to investigate the morphologies of both surface and cross sectional images we used sem jeol series jsm 6510 la japan to scan the membrane surface we placed a membrane sample on a sample holder and then sputter coated it with gold the sample was then examined by sem at 10 000x and 20 000x magnifications in the cross sectional scanning we immersed a membrane sample in liquid nitrogen and fractured it with tweezers the membrane was then placed on a sample holder and sputter coated with gold the morphology of the membrane was examined at 1 000x and 5 000x magnifications with an applied voltage of 20 kv 2 3 2 x ray diffraction xrd of nanohybrid membranes in fabricating the nanohybrid membranes membrane immersion in a non solvent during the phase inversion process is a critical step since the nanoparticles may leach out from the polymer matrix to verify the presence of nanoparticles in the membrane matrix we performed xrd analysis of the neat psf and nanohybrid psf membranes using an x ray diffractometer panalytical xrd x pert3 powder dy 5367 uk with a monochromatic cu kα radiation source at 300 ma 400 kv with 2θ range from 10 to 80 we identified the presence of the tio2 nanoparticles by identifying the typical peaks of tio2 particles 2 3 3 contact angle measurements to determine the surface hydrophilicity of the nanohybrid membranes we measured the water contact angles of the surface using an anglemeter race anglemeter japan contact angle measurements were performed using the sessile drop method at constant temperature 25 c using deionized water as the probe liquid we added a specific volume of water dropwise onto the membrane surface when the water droplet became stable after 30 s the measurement was made during a 4 min observation to minimize measurement error we chose from five to ten random dropping spots on the membrane surface to measure the contact angle under the same conditions 2 3 4 mechanical strength evaluation the mechanical strengths of the membranes were evaluated using a material testing machine uts h001 china to determine their tensile stress strength and elongation break values stress strain measurements were applied on 5 cm 1 cm 100 μm membrane samples at a stretching rate of 20 mm min 1 we recorded the applied force per unit area and the elongation of the membrane at the point of the material break as the tensile strength and elongation break values respectively the obtained data were based on an average of three sample measurements 2 3 5 membrane porosity and average pore radius the porosity and pore size of membranes are difficult to measure directly as reported by li et al 25 and hong and he 26 the porosity can instead be estimated using the dry wet gravimetric method to do so we immersed a piece of membrane in deionized water for 24 h then wiped the wet membrane surface with cleaning paper the wiped membrane was then weighed and dried at 60 c and weighed again to obtain the dry membrane weight the porosity of the membrane was determined using eq 1 as follows 1 ε w i w 0 ρ w a δ 100 where ε is the porosity of the membrane wi and w0 are the weights of the wet and dry membranes g respectively ρw is the density of pure water at 25 c 0 997 g cm 3 a is the effective area of the membrane cm2 and δ is the membrane thickness cm we determined the average pore size by the filtration velocity method using the guerout elford ferry formula the pore size rm can be calculated using eq 2 as follows 2 r m 2 9 1 75 ε 8 η l q ε a δ p where η is the viscosity of the pure water 8 9 10 4 pa s l is the membrane thickness m q is the volume of the permeate per unit of time m3 s 1 and δp is the trans membrane pressure pa 2 4 permeate flux and pollutant rejection to measure the permeate fluxes of pure water and original rubber wastewater we used a lab scale cross flow membrane filtration cell with an effective area of 15 90 cm2 a schematic diagram of the filtration process is shown in fig 2 the fabricated membrane was mounted in the membrane cell and then compacted using deionized water at 5 bar for 30 min until reaching a steady permeate flux we recorded the pure water permeate at pressures from 2 bar to 8 bar for the rubber wastewater filtration after the membrane had been compacted using deionized water wastewater was introduced to the membrane at 5 bar and permeate water was collected over a period of time the pure water flux jw and wastewater permeate flux jww were calculated using eq 3 as follows 3 j w o r j w w v i a δ t where vi is the volume of permeate water at a certain period of time l a is the effective area of the membrane m2 and δt is the permeate collection time h jw and jww are the permeate fluxes of pure water and wastewater l m 2 h 1 respectively to evaluate the membrane s performance in removing pollutants from the rubber wastewater we performed a rejection analysis by measuring wastewater pollutant parameters such as the total dissolved solids tds turbidity ammonia content and chemical oxygen demand cod in both the feed and permeate wastewaters the pollutant rejection was determined using eq 4 as follows 4 r i 1 c p i c f i 100 where ri is the rejection efficiency with respect to a certain pollutant and cpi and cfi are the concentrations of pollutants in the permeate and feed wastewater respectively 2 5 fouling resistance analysis a decrease in the permeate flux during membrane separation is caused by a combination of reversible and irreversible fouling the presence of foulant in the membrane can be investigated by evaluating the fouling resistance using the pure water permeation method we determined the resistances of the intrinsic membrane rm reversible fouling rrf and irreversible fouling rif using a series model derived from darcy s equation to evaluate intrinsic membrane resistance we performed a pure water permeation test using a clean membrane irreversible fouling resistance was evaluated by removing the foulant deposited on the membrane to do so the fouled membrane was carefully rinsed using deionized water and then soaked in distilled water for 24 h we determined the rm rif and rrf values using eqs 5 7 respectively 27 28 5 r m δ p μ j 0 6 r

the viscosity of the pure water pa s and δp is the trans membrane pressure pa 3 results and discussion 3 1 membrane surface and cross sectional morphologies the images from sem analysis were useful to characterize the surface and cross section morphology of the nanohybrid psf tio2 membranes fig 3 shows eight sem images of membrane surface and cross section of neat psf and psf tio2 nanohybrid membranes the membrane surface was dense and no dark spot that indicates the presence of the void defect the nano tio2 particles were observed spreading on the membrane surface some of the particles are assembled however the agglomerates aren t formed for membrane with tio2 concentration of 0 5 1 0 wt it indicates that nano tio2 is well mixed homogenously during dope solution preparation at the magnification of 20 000x the pores of the membrane could not be observed confirming that the pores were in the nano scale the nano gaps between nano particles and the polymer was not found it seems that nano tio2 has a good interaction behavior with psf polymer and they are attached to each other however at a higher concentration of tio2 2 wt nanoparticles agglomeration was found with unselective nanogaps in general the fabricated membranes have an asymmetric structure consisting of a dense skin layer and a porous sublayer that has finger like void morphology this kind of structure is generally found in the membrane that is produced using the nips method 29 however the neat psf cross section image shows a uniformly sponge like structure it could be due to the rheological properties of the casting solution which affects the demixing rate during the phase inversion process the finger like voids of the psf tio2 membrane are larger with the increasing of tio2 loading concentration the possible answer is the addition of nano tio2 enhances the dope solution hydrophilicity since it has a strong hydrophilic nature that leads to faster solvent diffusion during phase inversion the finger like micro void structure extends from the middle to the bottom of the membrane as shown in fig 3 the nano tio2 distribution is localized on the surface of the membrane this may be caused by mobile particles during the demixing process when the polymer solution is in contact with non solvent during this process there is a migration of solvents from the polymer solution phase to the non solvent phase the solvent movement out of the polymer matrix is replaced by non solvent which depresses the tio2 nanoparticles towards the surface this condition is advantageous in membrane fabrication because according to a previous study report the addition of nanoparticles is known to increase the hydrophilicity of membrane surfaces significantly 30 more hydrophilic membranes have been reported to improve flux performance and minimize membrane fouling problems 31 during filtration water molecules pass through the membrane via non clogged pores created by the interspace between nano tio2 particles and polymer thus enhance the permeate flux membrane surface hydrophilicity can be improved by the addition of hydrophilic nanoparticles however the over loading of nanoparticles may initiate the agglomerate formation that significantly reduces the membrane separation performance 3 2 x ray diffraction analysis the phase inversion process when using a non solvent is a critical point during nanohybrid membrane fabrication incorporated nanoparticles may leach out of the polymer matrix due to their affinity with water as a non solvent to verify the presence of nanoparticles in the membrane matrix we performed an xrd analysis typically xrd is used to identify changes in the crystallinity of material but apart from its function in crystalline phase identification this non destructive analysis can also be used to identify the presence of materials therefore we examined the xrd patterns of neat psf tio2 nanoparticle powder and nanohybrid psf tio2 to determine the presence of tio2 nanoparticles in the psf matrix fig 4 shows the xrd diffraction patterns of neat psf tio2 nanoparticles and the nanohybrid membrane of psf tio2 in which we can see that psf is a glassy polymer with an amorphous phase and no crystalline peak the xrd patterns of tio2 powder shows a crystalline phase with four characteristic crystalline peaks at 2θs of 27 43 36 09 41 25 and 54 31 this results in accordance with previous studies reported by wu et al 32 we used the nanohybrid membrane with the lowest tio2 nanoparticle loading 0 5 wt as a sample to show that the tio2 and psf are firmly attached the xrd patterns of the nanohybrid membrane shown in fig 2 also have four crystalline peaks that correspond to the tio2 crystalline peaks however these peaks are weakly dispersed on the amorphous psf membrane with careful observation we find that the crystalline peaks in the nanohybrid membrane exhibit a slight shift with the peaks at 27 66 36 33 44 55 and 54 59 this indicates that there may have been an interaction between the tio2 nanoparticle and psf polymer the xrd analysis revealed that the tio2 nanoparticles in the dope solution had not leached out during the phase inversion process and the nanoparticles had been distributed throughout the membrane matrix to evaluate the nanoparticles leaching from the psf membrane a spent nanohybrid membrane from rubber wastewater filtration test was analyzed using xrd the diffraction profile shows that the used nanohybrid membrane has different peaks than the clean nanohybrid membrane there are some addition sharp peaks in the range of 2θ 15 to 20 these peaks might come from the salt that adsorbed on the membrane the typical peaks of tio2 nanoparticles were also found among the amorphous signal that indicates the nanoparticles were well attached within the psf matrix and were not leached during the filtration process 3 3 membranes porosity and pore analysis the structural properties of the membrane are important to identify to obtain information about membrane separation and permeability to characterize the membrane structure we measured its porosity thickness and mean pore size table 3 shows the structural properties of the fabricated membranes at various concentrations of tio2 nanoparticles as shown in table 3 the thickness of the membranes varied with the concentration of tio2 particles the neat psf membrane had a thickness of 55 μm and with the addition of 0 5 wt and 1 0 wt tio2 nanoparticles this thickness slightly increased to 60 μm and 65 μm respectively during the film casting process the dope solution was cast at a thickness of 150 μm and the membrane thickness reduced due to solvent demixing and water loss during the drying process the presence of nanoparticles distributed throughout the whole of the membrane matrix serves to maintain the membrane structure however concentrations greater than 1 0 wt showed similar thicknesses of 65 μm a possible reason for this is that at higher nanoparticle concentrations the volume fraction of psf in the nanohybrid membrane decreases according to table 3 with an increase of nanoparticle concentration i e the addition of up to 1 0 wt tio2 the porosity of the membranes increased from 36 to 43 however at higher concentrations more than 1 0 wt the membrane porosity slightly declines this alteration in the membrane porosity due to nanoparticle loading is attributed to the increasing hydrophilicity of the dope solution tio2 nanoparticles are well known to be strongly hydrophilic materials that can enhance the dope solution hydrophilicity with higher hydrophilicity the solvent demixing during phase inversion occurs more quickly the rapid demixing of the solvent from the polymer phase creates larger micropores in the intermediate layer as shown in the sem images fig 1 at the higher concentrations 1 0 wt of tio2 the dope solution becomes more viscous this accords with a previous study in which the addition of some inorganic nanoparticles significantly increased the dope solution viscosity due to the high surface area and high surface energy of the nanoparticles 26 the viscosity of the dope solution affects the coagulation rate due to the demixing rate of the solvent in a non solvent immersion with a viscous dope solution the exchange rate between the solvent and non solvent is slower the consequence of the slow demixing process is lower membrane porosity based on these results we can conclude that the addition of nanoparticles to the dope solution influenced its hydrophilicity and viscosity at a relatively low concentration of nanoparticles the hydrophilicity enhancement effect dominates during phase inversion whereas at a high nanoparticle concentration the viscosity of the dope solution increases similarly the mean pore size radius increases with the addition of tio2 nanoparticles from 7 65 nm to 10 10 nm with a tio2 loading of 1 5 wt at a 2 wt tio2 loading the pore size of the membrane decreases slightly to 9 87 nm this could be due to the fact that the incorporation of tio2 nanoparticles provided nanogaps between the nanoparticle surfaces and the psf matrix such that when overloading of the nanoparticles occurred the nanoparticles blocked the pores 3 4 water contact angle and pwf one of the most significant membrane properties that strongly affect membrane performance and anti fouling behavior is surface hydrophilicity the hydrophilicity of a membrane surface can be determined by measuring the water contact angle a membrane with a contact angle of less than 90 is considered to be hydrophilic and a smaller water contact angle as shown in fig 5 indicates that the membrane is more hydrophilic the static water contact angle of the nanohybrid psf tio2 membrane decreased when the amount of tio2 nanoparticles increased we attribute this hydrophilicity enhancement of the membrane surface to the addition of tio2 nanoparticles which are well known to be strongly hydrophilic as shown in fig 5 the neat psf membrane is slightly hydrophobic with a water contact angle of 61 83 with the addition of 0 5 wt tio2 the contact angle declined to 48 57 and this decline continued until the addition of 1 5 wt tio2 when the contact angle was 41 67 the strong affinity of tio2 nanoparticles with water caused the nanoparticles to migrate toward the top layer of the membrane during the phase inversion process and reduce the interface energy 33 however the addition of more than 1 5 wt tio2 nanoparticles slightly increased the water contact angle this is probably due to the nanoparticle s self assembling into agglomerates which increased the roughness of the membrane surface based on our sem images we confirmed that membrane surfaces at higher concentrations exhibit a concentrated distribution of nanoparticles in the top layer of the membrane similar results have been reported for nano sized zno and iron oxide in pes membranes 13 34 from the results of this study we can conclude that the addition of tio2 nanoparticles significantly enhances the hydrophilicity of the membrane surface but the addition of more than a certain amount of tio2 in this study 1 5 wt increases the membrane roughness due to agglomeration by taking advantage of this improvement in hydrophilicity through tio2 loading its application can mitigate fouling in rubber wastewater treatment the structural properties of membranes include porosity mean pore size membrane thickness the skin layer sublayer structure and hydrophilicity from which the permeation performance of membranes can be determined from the above discussion we know that the addition of tio2 nanoparticles to a psf membrane significantly affects its structural properties therefore the hydrophilicity enhancement and change in membrane morphology may also influence the pwf fig 6 shows the effect on the pw fof the addition of nano tio2 particles generally the pwf profile increases almost linearly with the concentration of tio2 loading the neat psf has the lowest pwf and reaches its highest pwf value when the concentration of tio2 is 2 0 wt at a relatively low concentration of tio2 0 5 1 0 wt the pwf enhancement is attributed to the improvement in membrane porosity and the wide distribution of nanoparticles at high concentrations of tio2 1 5 2 0 wt agglomerations of nanoparticles occur which creates larger surface pores that lead to low membrane resistance the low pwf value bellow 5 l m 2 h 1 in this study could be due to the low tmp during filtration the membranes in this study are considered as nanofiltration where the suitable pressure is in the range of 5 25 bars during filtration process the tmp was maintained at 5 bars thus the pwf values were relatively low to obtained higher pwf value higher tmp should be applied 3 5 evaluation of membrane mechanical strength the mechanical strength of a membrane determines its durability when it is used in a filtration process therefore the evaluation of mechanical strength in membrane fabrication is an important task fig 7 shows the tensile strength and elongation break values of fabricated membranes in the figure we can see that as the concentration of tio2 increased from 0 wt to 2 0 wt both the tensile strength and elongation break values increased from 4 1 mpa to 5 7 mpa and from 4 20 to 15 50 respectively this indicates that the incorporation of tio2 nanoparticles improved the force load of the membrane whereby the force applied to the membrane was distributed to the polymer and nanoparticles which means that the membrane doesn t break as easily with the application of higher force 35 another possible reason for the increased mechanical strength is the interaction between the tio2 nanoparticles and psf whereby the nanoparticles act as a linking agent to connect the polymer chain to the membrane and increase its rigidity 25 however the addition of more than 1 0 wt tio2 decreases the tensile strength a possible reason for this is the localized self assembly of the nanoparticles in the body of the membrane the weak cohesive force between the nanoparticles in agglomerates causes a disconnection between the polymer chains the addition of nanoparticles in nanohybrid membrane fabrication should be maintained at a certain concentration in this study 1 5 wt to maintain the adhesive bond between the tio2 particles and psf and thereby improve the mechanical strength of the membrane 3 6 membrane filtration performance on wastewater 3 6 1 permeate flux a permeation test using pure water provided insufficient data regarding the filtration performance of a membrane a filtration test must be performed using the original rubber wastewater to evaluate the ability of the membrane to remove complex pollutants this test also provides information for producing an actual permeate flux profile for rubber wastewater treatment fig 6 shows the normalized and actual flux profiles for rubber wastewater filtration using fabricated membranes with various tio2 concentrations the flux profiles of all the membranes exhibit a sharp decline early in the filtration process this could be due to the deposition of reversible fouling on the membrane surface after a period of time the flux profiles exhibit a pseudo steady state with a slight decline in the permeate flux due to the high concentration of organic materials in the rubber wastewater this phenomenon is due to the deposition of the absorbed foulant within the membrane in fig 8 the flux profile of neat psf has the lowest permeate flux and the sharpest flux decline relative to the nanohybrid membrane this is due to the poor hydrophilicity of the neat psf membrane which causes the deposition of foulant on the membrane no pseudo steady state occurs in the normalized flux of the neat psf membrane which means that there is a continuous deposition of absorbed foulant the nanohybrid membranes with tio2 loadings of 1 5 wt and 2 0 wt show sharp declines in their normalized flux despite their high actual permeate fluxes the reason for this may be that the surface morphologies of the membranes with tio2 loadings greater than 1 5 wt have rougher membrane surfaces which leads to the deposition of reversible fouling on the membrane surface 36 the addition of tio2 loadings between 0 5 wt and 1 0 wt however result in moderate permeate fluxes and slight flux declines this reveals that well blended nanoparticles in a nanohybrid membrane with minimal agglomeration enhance the hydrophilicity of the membrane surface the morphology of the membrane sublayer and the roughness of the lower membrane hence its permeate flux is improved and the degree of fouling is mitigated 3 6 2 pollutant removal efficiency the rejection of pollutants in wastewater varies with the type of compound molecule or particle rejection in membrane separation may occur based on size exclusion charge exclusion polarity difference solubility properties or affinity difference based on the rejection rate for each component shown in fig 9 and our characterization of the structural properties we know that the membranes in this study are nanofiltration membranes for which size exclusion charge exclusion and affinity difference between the membrane material and pollutant components play important roles in determining the separation performance we found the tds rejection rates to be lowest for all types of nanohybrid membranes which can be explained by the fact that the pores of this membrane are nanoscale in size the membranes may thus be able to reject multivalent ions but perform less well in rejecting monovalent ions with this fact it can be assumed that the main component in tds is monovalent ions the highest tds rejection rate of 14 03 was achieved by the membrane with a 1 0 wt tio2 loading the rejection rates of cod and nh3 for all membranes were relatively high ranging from 54 to 87 and from 76 to 89 respectively the higher rejection rates for cod and nh3 than tds can be explained by the size exclusion principle as cod organic compounds are larger than the most ions so they experience higher rejection rates for nh3 the presence of nh3 in water occurs in the equilibrium state of ammonium ions and soluble ammonia n h 3 h 2 o n h 4 o h the introduction of tio2 nanoparticles in a zwitterionic or neutral material causes the surface charge to become positive 37 hence the ammonium ion is excluded based on its similar charge turbidity rejection exhibited the highest efficiency of 99 the turbidity rejection measure in wastewater indicates the amount of micro sized particles that were effectively removed using the nanofiltration membrane 38 we observed a similar trend in the rejection profiles of all the pollutants with the highest rejection achieved when the tio2 loading was 1 0 wt at this point the removal efficiencies of tds cod nh3 and turbidity were 14 03 87 88 88 79 and 99 respectively this indicates that the addition of tio2 nanoparticles significantly enhanced pollutant removal efficiency however when the tio2 loading was greater than 1 0 wt the removal efficiencies of all the components slightly declined a possible reason for this is the formation of nanoparticle agglomerates in which unselective nanogaps are created this reasoning is also supported by our previous finding that the incorporation of high concentrations of tio2 produces membranes with larger pore sizes 3 7 analysis of fouling resistance next we evaluated the anti fouling properties of the membranes based on their fouling resistances during pure water permeation of fouled membranes resistance may occur due to the membrane s intrinsic resistance and absorbed irreversible foulant internal fouling or cake formation reversible fouling deposition in table 4 the psf membrane has the highest rm value 13 75 1016 m 1 relative to the nanohybrid membrane this is due to the higher porosity of the nanohybrid membrane and the enhanced hydrophilicity of the membrane surface such that the water more easily permeates the membrane barrier in the table we can see that the rm value decreases with increases in the tio2 concentration as this yields larger pore sizes and porosities the lowest irreversible fouling resistance rir which is related to the absorbed foulant compounds in the membrane was achieved by psf tio2 2 0 wt 1 46 1016 m 1 this occurs due to the strong affinity between the foulant compounds and the membrane matrix according to the rir results listed in table 4 the foulant was most highly absorbed by the psf polymer so the addition of tio2 decreases the amount of absorbed foulant since it decreases the mass fraction of the polymer in the membrane the reversible fouling resistance is related to the cake formation on the membrane surface during filtration with the rrf of pes tio2 0 5 wt showing the lowest resistance 6 9 1015 m 1 cake formation strongly depends on the membrane hydrophilicity and membrane surface roughness 39 as discussed in the previous section the formation of self assembled nanoparticle agglomerates caused an increase in the membrane surface roughness due to the higher hydrophilicity and lower membrane surface roughness of the psf tio2 0 5 wt nanohybrid membrane it showed the lowest rrf value in addition the lowest total resistance rt was exhibited by the nanohybrid membrane with 2 0 wt tio2 loading this result accords with the findings of previous studies that at higher loading concentrations of nanofillers the total resistance of a membrane decreases 40 3 8 permeate water evaluation and its potential for recycling purpose large amounts of water are needed to process natural rubber without any steps taken to recycle the used water this process becomes increasingly uneconomical and wasteful of clean water conventional processing cannot achieve the processed water quality necessary to meet the required standards in this study we evaluated the quality of treated wastewater for which we used a psf tio2 nanohybrid membrane and we compared it against the clean water quality standards established by the indonesian ministry of health for agro industries 41 table 5 lists the permeate quality and clean water quality standards for agro industries as shown in the table almost all the parameters meet the quality standards but the cod and nh3 values remain still slightly above the permitted standards processing wastewater using this process has the potential for use in recycling water from natural rubber production although the process must be improved to increase the cod and ammonia rejection rates based on this research and given the average wastewater quantity of 300 m3 day produced by the indonesian rubber industry the required effective membrane area is about 2500 m2 3 9 flux recovery after membrane cleaning permeate water flux during wastewater filtration decreased as function of time due to deposition of pollutant on the membrane membrane cleaning is required to recover the permeate flux flux recovery of the membrane after cleaning via backwashing was evaluated in this study the permeate flux profile after backwashing was shown in fig 10 overall the flux obtained from nanohybrid membranes were higher than flux from neat psf membrane the flux significantly declined in the initial filtration where total flux drops of neat psf psf tio2 1 0 wt and psf tio2 1 5 wt were 77 51 and 44 respectively after 150 min of experimental time after backwashing the flux recovery of neat psf psf tio2 1 0 wt psf tio2 1 5 wt were 61 89 and 91 respectively the flux recovery of the nanohybrid membranes are higher than neat psf due to the fouling behavior of the membrane based on resistance evaluation table 5 neat psf membrane h showed higher irreversible foulant resistance than that of nanohybrid membrane this high irreversible resistance is indicating that adsorbed foulant in neat psf membrane is higher since the backwashing only remove reversible foulant on the membrane surface the nanohybrid membranes have better flux recovery the second backwashing step showed the flux recovery of the neat psf psf tio2 1 0 wt and psf tio2 1 5 wt were 67 62 42 in a sequential backwashing procedure flux recovery decreases with the number of backwashing process 4 conclusion in this study we prepared nanohybrid membranes via a dry wet phase inversion process and then introduced various amounts of tio2 nanoparticles to a psf dope solution to improve the structural properties of the nanohybrid membranes the addition of a tio2 nanofiller significantly changed the membrane morphologies xrd analysis revealed a strong interaction between tio2 nanoparticles and the psf polymer the addition of tio2 also controlled the top layer and sublayer of the asymmetric membrane with the formation of larger finger like pores the addition of a small amount of tio2 in the dope solution also resulted in greater porosity and pore size however increasing the amount of tio2 nanoparticles from 1 5 wt to 2 0 wt resulted in slight decreases in the porosity and pore size due to the increased viscosity of the dope solution which affects the solvent exchange rate during phase inversion we found the hydrophilicity of the membrane surface to be enhanced by introducing tio2 nanoparticles with the contact angle decreasing from 61 83 to 41 67 when the nanofiller loading was increased the contact angle increased to 43 50 due to the formation of agglomerates which increased the membrane surface roughness the presence of tio2 nanoparticles also improved the mechanical strength of the psf membranes the highest pwf 4 65 l m 2 h 1 was achieved by the membrane with 2 0 wt tio2 loading due to its higher porosity and pore size the best pollutant removal efficiency was exhibited by the psf tio2 1 0 wt membrane with tds cod nh3 and turbidity removal rates reaching 14 03 87 88 88 79 and 99 respectively the improved hydrophilicity of the 0 5 wt tio2 loading membrane led to the lowest reversible fouling resistance rrf 6 90 1015 m 1 for natural rubber wastewater treatment

electrode keywords electrocoagulation dielectrophoresis dep secondary treated wastewater stw total phosphorous tp chemical oxygen demand cod 1 introduction electrocoagulation ec is an advanced coagulation technique where the coagulants are generated from the dissolution of electrodes electrocoagulation has some advantages over the conventional wastewater treatment techniques such as ease in solid liquid separation high pollutant removal efficiency low sludge volume inexpensive operation and compact facility 1 4 electrocoagulation consists of two submerged metal electrodes connected to a power supply for a certain electrolysis time the passing current causes the dissolution of metals from the electrodes which forms metal ions 6 5 these metal ions induce three stage pollutant removal processes the three stages are formation of coagulants destabilization and neutralization of contaminants and suspended colloids and aggregation of these destabilized colloids forming flocs that can be settled down by gravity 6 9 previous studies have shown that electrocoagulation can effectively treat different types of wastewaters as shown in table 1 in electrocoagulation the most commonly used electrode materials are aluminum al and iron fe the main advantages of al and fe as electrode materials are their availability and non toxicity as they form non toxic hydroxides 2 several studies have shown that aluminum electrodes gave higher removal percentages of different pollutants when compared to iron electrodes in an electrocoagulation process 2 10 illhan et al 2008 have shown that the cod removal efficiency of al electrode is 25 higher than fe electrodes 11 studies have showed that electrocoagulation can be operated with either a direct current dc or an alternating current ac power supply 12 table 1 summarizes several studies used electrocoagulation for the treatment of different wastewaters targeting different pollutants under different operating parameters to the best of our knowledge none of the previous studies have examined the impact of the use of unsymmetrical electrodes on the performance of the electrocoagulation process in this paper a new electrode configuration with an unsymmetrical aluminum electrode is being proposed the use of unsymmetrical electrodes in electrocoagulation is expected to generate an extra force which is the dielectrophoresis dep force the aim of this study is to enhance the removal efficiency of total phosphorus tp and chemical oxygen demand cod from a secondary treated wastewater stw by the application of the dep electrocoagulation process the impact of electrode configuration and type of power supply on tp and cod removal were evaluated in addition the impact of electrolysis time and current density on the removal of tp and cod were evaluated a simulation model was built using comsol multiphysics software to simulate the performance of the new electrode configuration 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental set up fig 1

by gentle mixing provided by a magnetic stirrer three different modules were tested module 1 and module 2 used symmetrical electrodes with a direct current and an alternative current power supply respectively module 1 and module 2 will be referred to as dc and ac respectively in module 3 unsymmetrical electrodes with an alternative current power supply were used module 3 will be referred to as ac dep in the dc and ac modules two non porous aluminum electrodes were used a small cylindrical electrode with a diameter of 2 5 cm was place in the center of a hollow cylindrical electrode with a diameter of 4 5 cm the length of both electrodes was 15 cm the effective area was 274 9 cm2 and 551 4 cm2 for the inner and the outer electrodes respectively the distance between the electrodes was 1 cm as shown in fig 1 electrode a in the ac dep module two nonporous aluminum electrodes where also used however the dimensions of the inner electrode were 2 5 cm in diameter and 5 cm length with an effective area of 117 8 cm2 the outer electrode remained the same as before for the dc module the inner electrode is considered as the anode where the effective area is equal to the area of the anode while for the ac and ac dep modules the effective area is equal to the average of the effective area between the inner and outer electrodes in both ac dep and ac modules the electrodes were connected to a variac variable transformer variac cleveland ohio to deliver a voltage in a range of 0 250 v at a constant frequency of 50 hz moreover for the measurements of current and voltage an oscilloscope mdo3024 tektronix beaverton oregon was used the type of wave that was used is a sine wave usually ac power supply generates sine wave with time rely the time rely concept is to shift the function of the anode and cathode occasionally 23 while for dc module the electrodes were connected to a dc power supply gpc m series the weight of electrodes was recorded before and after each run after each run the electrodes were rinsed with water and dried to make sure that the electrodes are free of any contaminants the weight of electrodes was measured using a citizen cy 1003 precision balance for each module the current density was calculated by dividing the electric current by the effective surface area for that module 2 2 experimental procedure for each run 2130 ml of stw was placed in a beaker all experiments were done at ambient temperature 20 for each module three different runs were conducted each with a different applied current density 0 8 2 6 and 4 3 ma cm2 samples were extracted from the reactor at three different times 5 min 10 min and 30 min for each sample ph value and conductivity values were recorded all samples were filtered using a 0 45 μm millipore filter then the filtrate was analyzed for cod and tp 2 3 wastewater characterization a secondary treated effluent collected after the secondary settling tank from a wastewater treatment plant in doha was used in this study the characteristics of the collected wastewater and the used standard method to measure each value are summarized in table 2 2 4 numerical methods dielectrophoretic force is the movement of free particle by dielectric polarization in an inhomogeneous electric field 21 placing a particle suspended in an electrolyte in an inhomogeneous electric field causes a redistribution of the charges inside the particle and the medium at their interface this redistribution depends on the polarizability of the particle and the medium additionally this distribution leads to a difference in the charge density at each end of the particle which leads to an induced dipole induced dipole can be represented by different forces at each end of the particle at which the difference between these two forces gives a net force called dielectrophoretic force 22 the dielectrophoretic force applied on spherical particle can be calculated using the following equation 1 f d e p 4 π a 3 ε 0 ε m r e k e e where a is the particle radius ε 0 is the permittivity of free space 8 854 10 12 f m ε m is the absolute permittivity of the medium e is the field intensity v m and r e k is the clausius mossotti cm factor which can be calculated by 23 2 k ε p ε m ε p 2 ε m 3 ε ε j σ ω when an ac power supply is used all the permittivities will be replaced with the complex permittivity 22 where ε p is the complex permittivity of the particle ε m is the complex permittivity of the medium ε is the complex permittivity σ is the conductivity s m ω is the angular frequency r a d s j is the geometric gradient of the square of electric field e which can be calculated by 23 4 j 1 e e 1 2 e 2 based on the permittivity of the particle and medium the suspended particles can present different dep effects in which it can move in different directions these effects are positive dep pdep and negative dep ndep if the permittivity of the particles is higher than the medium then the particles will be attracted by the stronger electric field and it will present pdep whereas if the permittivity of the particles is lower than the medium then the particles will be attracted by the weaker electric field and it will present ndep 24 25 the particles in stw will exert a negative dep effect due to the high conductivity of stw at which the polarizability of the suspended particles will be lower than the medium stw 21 it should be mentioned here that the dep force will affect all suspended particles regardless of their electrical charge and this is considered as one of the main advantages of applying such force 24 the geometrical sketch for the aluminum cylindrical electrodes used in the simulation model is shown in fig 2 comsol multiphysics software was used to simulate the square electric field between the inner and the outer electrode according to eq 1 the square electric field is directly related with the dielectrophoretic dep force the simulation was conducted in two dimensions assuming that the height of the electrodes going to infinity the electric potential was solved at a set of boundary conditions in order to calculate the electric field which would indicate the dep force exerted on the particles the medium between the two electrodes was assumed to be the used wastewater with the specific measured conductivity the quasi electrostatic form was used in order to solve this problem for the applied currents and frequencies the root mean square rms of the electric field is given by 5 e φ where φ is the rms of the electrostatic potential which can be given by laplace s equation assuming that the medium is liquid only with the absence of any particles and it is homogeneous 6 2 φ 0 fixed boundary conditions are applied on the surface of the charge carrying electrodes which are the inner electrode and outer electrode 7 φ 1 u 0 2 8 φ 2 u 0 2 where u 0 is the rms of the oscillating potential drop in order to ensure mesh independent results adaptive mesh refinement has been applied 2 5 error estimation electrocoagulation process for each of the three modules and each current density were repeated three times the error bars represent the standard deviation of a data set 29 the following equation was used to calculate the standard deviation error bars for each data set 9 s d 1 n x i x 2 n where x i the measured value x the average of the three measured values and n the number of replications error bars are depicted on all figures and all standard deviation error bars do not exceed 5 3 results and discussion 3 1 impact of power supply system 3 1 1 impact of current density current density and electrolysis time play a key role in the performance of electrocoagulation process current density determines the required rate of coagulant dosage and bubble production 5 the impact of three different current densities were studied 0 8 2 6 and 4 3 ma cm2 these three current densities were chosen to cover a low medium and high range in addition these current densities were tested on the basis of our previous study 26 fig 3 a shows the impact of current density on tp removal and fig 3 b shows the impact of current density on cod reduction with an alternating and a direct current power supply at 30 min electrolysis time generally tp removal efficiency and cod reduction percent were increasing as the current density increases for both ac and dc power supply at a 30 min electrolysis time the maximum tp removal and cod reduction for ac and dc were obtained at 4 3 ma cm2 current density as the current density increases more current passes through the electrodes which leads to more dissolution of electrodes into metal ions al3 according to faraday s law more dissolution of electrodes is expected to boost the formation of various large metal hydroxides flocs at which the total phosphorous organic matter and inorganic matter can adsorb onto and eventually settling down by gravity this leads to the increase of tp removal efficiency and cod reduction 15 27 previous studies also found a direct relationship between the current density and the tp and cod removal efficiency 7 28 using an ac power supply compared to a dc power supply enhanced the tp and cod removal efficiency at a current density of 4 3 ma cm2 by 22 2 and 23 5 respectively the higher removal percentages obtained by using an ac power supply could be due to the fact that the function of the anode and cathode is shifted occasionally this is expected to decrease the load in the function of each electrode hence it retards the cathode passivation and anode deterioration phenomena that would occurred while using a dc power supply 19 23 the retardation of the cathode passivation and anode deterioration would enhance the formation of metal hydroxides which would enhance the removal process in electrocoagulation 19 3 1 2 impact of electrolysis time fig 4 a shows the impact of electrolysis time on tp removal efficiency and fig 4 b shows the impact of electrolysis time on cod reduction using an ac and a dc power supply at 4 3 ma cm2 current density at a 5 min electrolysis time the tp removal efficiency and cod reduction for dc were only 32 9 and 27 1 respectively while for ac the tp removal efficiency and cod reduction were 48 7 and 47 4 respectively the short period of time was insufficient for the formation of the required metal hydroxides as the electrolysis time increased the removal percentages increased a maximum tp removal of 68 2 and 46 0 were obtained at 30 min electrolysis time for ac and dc respectively a maximum cod reduction of 66 8 and 43 3 were obtained at 30 min electrolysis time for ac and dc respectively it could be noticed from fig 4 that the removal percentage of tp and cod reached equilibrium after 10 min as the electrolysis time increased higher than 10 min the removal percentage of tp and cod almost remained constant the higher removal percentages obtained by using an ac power supply could be due to the fact that after a certain electrolysis time if a dc power supply is used cathode passivation could occur cathode passivation is the formation of an impermeable oxide layer on the surface of the cathode the formation of such layer would decrease the transfer of ions from anode to cathode and eventually would affect the dissolution of anode leading to the decrease in the formation of metal hydroxides 19 using an ac power supply would highly decrease cathode passivation due to the alteration between cathode and anode and hence enhance the efficiency of the electrocoagulation process 29 3 2 impact of electrode configuration 3 2 1 simulation results the dep force has a direct relationship with the electric field squared as shown in eq 1 therefore the simulation of the electric field squared was developed in order to examine the effect of current density on the dep force field distribution as can be seen in fig 5 the simulated results showed that the strength of the generated dep force was increasing towards the surface of the inner electrode having a maximum value at the surface of the inner electrode for all applied current densities as can be shown in fig 6 moreover the results showed that the electrode configuration with 4 3 ma cm2 current density generated the highest maximum dep force the strength of electric field squared distribution followed the declining order of 4 3 ma cm2 2 6 ma cm2 and 0 8 ma cm2 current density as can be seen in fig 6 therefore as the applied current density increases the strength of the dep force increases 22 30 as can be seen by fig 6 the field distribution of the dep force is the highest at a current density of 4 3 ma cm2 therefore from the simulated results it is expected that the electrode configuration with 4 3 ma cm2 current density has the best removal enhancement this simulation has proven that the dep force works at low current density however it becomes more important and effective with increasing the applied current density hence higher applied current density can generate more dep forces which push more particles away from the inner electrode hence preventing the accumulation of the flocs on the electrode and forming larger agglomerates that can be settled by gravity consequently it enhances the removal efficiency 3 2 2 experimental results fig 7 a presents the impact of electrode configuration on tp removal efficiency and fig 7 b presents the impact of electrode configuration on cod reduction percent over 30 min electrolysis time and for the three different applied current densities it was found that at low current density 0 8 ma cm2 the removals obtained by ac dep are similar to ac this could be due to the low dep force generated at such current density this result can be also seen from the simulation results where fig 5 a and fig 6 show very low dep force at a current density of 0 8 ma cm2 at higher current densities i e 2 6 and 4 3 ma cm2 the ac dep module showed higher removal percentages for tp and cod than the ac module especially at longer times of electrolysis fig 7 it can be seen from fig 7 a that the tp removal percentage at 30 min electrolysis time and 4 3 ma cm2 current density increased from 68 to 89 for ac and ac dep respectively it can be seen from fig 7 b that the cod reduction percentage at 30 min electrolysis time and 4 3 ma cm2 current density increased from 67 to 82 for ac and ac dep respectively this could be due to the fact that the generated dep force was large enough to push the particles away from the inner electrode surface enhancing the formation of larger agglomerates at which the contaminants adsorbed and eventually settle down by gravity fig 8 illustrates the expected impact of the dep force the dep force is pushing the particles away from the surface of the inner electrode exerting a negative dep ndep force this force is expected to enhance agglomeration of particles hence enhancing the removal efficiency 3 3 electrode corrosion the dissolution of anode into metal ions causes the corrosion of the electrode material electrode corrosion gives an indication of the life of the electrode therefore electrode corrosion play a key role in the viability of the electrocoagulation process 17 for dc module electrode corrosion was calculated by measuring the total weight loss in the anode while for ac dep module electrode corrosion was calculated by measuring the total weight loss for both inner and outer electrodes fig 9 presents the influence of electrode configuration on electrode corrosion at 30 min electrolysis time and 4 3 ma cm2 current density electrode mass consumptions for ac dep ac and dc modules were 0 02 0 15 and 2 12 g respectively as can be seen from fig 9 both electrode configuration that are working with an ac power supply have very small total weight loss compared to the dc electrode configuration this could be due to the fact that using an ac power supply would give a uniform dissolution of anode and more sufficient current through the solution 12 18 4 conclusions in this study electrocoagulation for the post treatment of stw using different cylindrical aluminum electrode configurations and different power supplies were investigated the main outcomes of this study are experimental results showed that adopting of ac power supply increases the removals of the targeted pollutants and it ensures longer electrode life these benefits can be further improved by the proposed electrode configuration ac dep the effect of the generated dep on the enhancement of the removals was observed at high applied current density this result agreed with the obtained simulation results in addition the effectiveness of the dep force was justified by its low electrode consumption thus ac dep module achieved the maximum tp removal efficiency of 88 3 and cod reduction of 82 4 with a minimum electrode corrosion of 0 02 mg finally this study shows that the effectiveness of

electrode keywords electrocoagulation dielectrophoresis dep secondary treated wastewater stw total phosphorous tp chemical oxygen demand cod 1 introduction electrocoagulation ec is an advanced coagulation technique where the coagulants are generated from the dissolution of electrodes electrocoagulation has some advantages over the conventional wastewater treatment techniques such as ease in solid liquid separation high pollutant removal efficiency low sludge volume inexpensive operation and compact facility 1 4 electrocoagulation consists of two submerged metal electrodes connected to a power supply for a certain electrolysis time the passing current causes the dissolution of metals from the electrodes which forms metal ions 6 5 these metal ions induce three stage pollutant removal processes the three stages are formation of coagulants destabilization and neutralization of contaminants and suspended colloids and aggregation of these destabilized colloids forming flocs that can be settled down by gravity 6 9 previous studies have shown that electrocoagulation can effectively treat different types of wastewaters as shown in table 1 in electrocoagulation the most commonly used electrode materials are aluminum al and iron fe the main advantages of al and fe as electrode materials are their availability and non toxicity as they form non toxic hydroxides 2 several studies have shown that aluminum electrodes gave higher removal percentages of different pollutants when compared to iron electrodes in an electrocoagulation process 2 10 illhan et al 2008 have shown that the cod removal efficiency of al electrode is 25 higher than fe electrodes 11 studies have showed that electrocoagulation can be operated with either a direct current dc or an alternating current ac power supply 12 table 1 summarizes several studies used electrocoagulation for the treatment of different wastewaters targeting different pollutants under different operating parameters to the best of our knowledge none of the previous studies have examined the impact of the use of unsymmetrical electrodes on the performance of the electrocoagulation process in this paper a new electrode configuration with an unsymmetrical aluminum electrode is being proposed the use of unsymmetrical electrodes in electrocoagulation is expected to generate an extra force which is the dielectrophoresis dep force the aim of this study is to enhance the removal efficiency of total phosphorus tp and chemical oxygen demand cod from a secondary treated wastewater stw by the application of the dep electrocoagulation process the impact of electrode configuration and type of power supply on tp and cod removal were evaluated in addition the impact of electrolysis time and current density on the removal of tp and cod were evaluated a simulation model was built using comsol multiphysics software to simulate the performance of the new electrode configuration 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental set up fig 1

effective area of 117 8 cm2 the outer electrode remained the same as before for the dc module the inner electrode is considered as the anode where the effective area is equal to the area of the anode while for the ac and ac dep modules the effective area is equal to the average of the effective area between the inner and outer electrodes in both ac dep and ac modules the electrodes were connected

all experiments were done at ambient temperature 20 for each module three different runs were conducted each with a different applied current density 0 8 2 6 and 4 3 ma cm2 samples were extracted from the reactor at three different times 5 min 10 min and 30 min for each sample ph value and conductivity values were recorded all samples were filtered using a 0 45 μm millipore filter then the filtrate was analyzed for cod and tp 2 3 wastewater characterization a secondary treated effluent collected after the secondary settling tank from a wastewater treatment plant in doha was used in this study

and cod reduction 15 27 previous studies also found a direct relationship between the current density and the tp and cod removal efficiency 7 28 using an ac power supply compared to a dc power supply enhanced the tp and cod removal efficiency at a current density of 4 3 ma cm2 by 22 2 and 23 5 respectively the higher removal percentages obtained by using an ac power supply could be due to the fact that the function of the anode and cathode is shifted occasionally this is expected to decrease the load in the function of each electrode hence it retards the cathode passivation and anode deterioration phenomena that would occurred while using a dc power supply 19 23 the retardation of the cathode passivation and anode deterioration would enhance the formation of metal hydroxides which would enhance the removal process in electrocoagulation 19 3 1 2 impact of electrolysis time fig 4 a shows the impact of electrolysis time on tp removal efficiency and fig 4 b shows the impact of electrolysis time on cod reduction using an ac and a dc power supply at 4 3 ma cm2 current density at a 5 min electrolysis time the tp removal efficiency and cod reduction for dc were only 32 9 and 27 1 respectively while for ac the tp removal efficiency and cod reduction were 48 7 and 47 4 respectively the short period of time was insufficient for the formation of the required metal hydroxides as the electrolysis time increased the removal percentages increased a maximum tp removal of 68 2 and 46 0 were obtained at 30 min electrolysis time for ac and dc respectively a maximum cod reduction of 66 8 and 43 3 were obtained at 30 min electrolysis time for ac and dc respectively it could be noticed from fig 4 that the removal percentage of tp and cod reached equilibrium after 10 min as the electrolysis time increased higher than 10 min the removal percentage of tp and cod almost remained constant the higher removal percentages obtained by using an ac power supply could be due to the fact that after a certain electrolysis time if a dc power supply is used cathode passivation could occur cathode passivation is the formation of an impermeable oxide layer on the surface of the cathode the formation of such layer would decrease the transfer of ions from anode to cathode and eventually would affect the dissolution of anode leading to the decrease in the formation of metal hydroxides 19 using an ac power supply would highly decrease cathode passivation due to the alteration between cathode and anode and hence enhance the efficiency of the electrocoagulation process 29 3 2 impact of electrode configuration 3 2 1 simulation results the dep force has a direct relationship with the electric field squared as shown in eq 1 therefore the simulation of the electric field squared was developed in order to examine the effect of current density on the dep force field distribution as can be seen in fig 5 the simulated results showed that the strength of the generated dep force was increasing towards the surface of the inner electrode having a maximum value at the surface of the inner electrode for all applied current densities as can be shown in fig 6 moreover the results showed that the electrode configuration with 4 3 ma cm2 current density generated the highest maximum dep force the strength of electric field squared distribution followed the declining order of 4 3 ma cm2 2 6 ma cm2 and 0 8 ma cm2 current density as can be seen in fig 6 therefore as the applied current density increases the strength of the dep force increases 22 30 as can be seen by fig 6 the field distribution of the dep force is the highest at a current density of 4 3 ma cm2 therefore from the simulated results it is expected that the electrode configuration with 4 3 ma cm2 current density has the best removal enhancement this simulation has proven that the dep force works at low current density however it becomes more important and effective with increasing the applied current density hence higher applied current density can generate more dep forces which push more particles away from the inner electrode hence preventing the accumulation of the flocs on the electrode and forming larger agglomerates that can be settled by gravity consequently it enhances the removal efficiency 3 2 2 experimental results fig 7 a presents the impact of electrode configuration on tp removal efficiency and fig 7 b presents the impact of electrode configuration on cod reduction percent over 30 min electrolysis time and for the three different applied current densities it was found that at low current density 0 8 ma cm2 the removals obtained by ac dep are similar to ac this could be due to the low dep force generated at such current density this result can be also seen from the simulation results where fig 5 a and fig 6 show very low dep force at a current density of 0 8 ma cm2 at higher current densities i e 2 6 and 4 3 ma cm2 the ac dep module showed higher removal percentages for tp and cod than the ac module especially at longer times of electrolysis fig 7 it can be seen from fig 7 a that the tp removal percentage at 30 min electrolysis time and 4 3 ma cm2 current density increased from 68 to 89 for ac and ac dep respectively it can be seen from fig 7 b that the cod reduction percentage at 30 min electrolysis time and 4 3 ma cm2 current density increased from 67 to 82 for ac and ac dep respectively this could be due to the fact that the generated dep force was large enough to push the particles away from the inner electrode surface enhancing the formation of larger agglomerates at which the contaminants adsorbed and eventually settle down by gravity fig 8 illustrates the expected impact of the dep force the dep force is pushing the particles away from the surface of the inner electrode exerting a negative dep ndep force this force is expected to enhance agglomeration of particles hence enhancing the removal efficiency 3 3 electrode corrosion the dissolution of anode into metal ions causes the corrosion of the electrode material electrode corrosion gives an indication of the life of the electrode therefore electrode

that are working with an ac power supply have very small total weight loss compared to the dc electrode configuration this could be due to the fact that using an ac power supply would give a uniform

14034,lemna gibba l gibba was successfully used for phytoremediation of wastewater rich 1 4 dioxane resulting biomass with high protein and carbon content however the efficiency of l gibba was strongly dependent on the reactor configuration i e classical and baffled duckweed pond dwp bdwp system the bdwp configuration provided a removal efficiency of 69 3 18 6 for 1 4 dioxane resulting a residual value of 50 2 29 7 mg l in the treated effluent the classical dwp module provided a lower removal efficiency of 20 8 11 9 and a higher residual value of 1 4 dioxane 115 6 30 7 mg l in the treated effluent 1 4 dioxane uptake using l gibba was occurred after decomposing into metabolite products in terms of glycolic and oxalic acids afterwards these acids further degraded into phosphoglycerate which easily absorbed by the plants and stored as amino acids in the tissues therefore alanine aspartic acid glycine threonine and serine were boosted by values of 47 3 32 5 26 5 26 1 and 20 respectively the removal mechanism of 1 4 dioxane via duckweed pond was mainly due to uptake followed by photo degradation process economic analysis is clearly emphasized on the applicability of the proposed configuration which achieved net profit and payback period of 159 4 year and 37 7 years respectively keywords phytoremediation micro pollutants lemna gibba uptake degradation photo degradation 1 introduction chemical industries consume considerable quantity of water in the manufacturing processes and produce approximately 70 of wastewater rich with toxic and dangerous pollutants 1 2 unsaturated polyester resin industry generates high strength wastewater containing high levels of 1 4 dioxane nutrients and heavy metals 3 4 1 4 dioxane is commonly utilized as a solvent in many chemical industries therefore 1 4 dioxane residual is produced as contaminant from manufacturing processes this contaminant is non biodegradable toxic hazardous and represents a dangerous priority pollutant wastewater containing 1 4 dioxane is discharged into sewerage network and causes a severe infrastructure environmental damage and toxicity 5 moreover the impurity of drinking water with 1 4 dioxane causes health problems i e cancers as a result eliminating 1 4 dioxane from wastewater is a must 6 adsorption on activated carbon and air striping was not successfully removed 1 4 dioxane from contaminated water due to its high solubility and low vapor pressure 7 oxidation of 1 4 dioxane using chlorine is effective nevertheless formation of toxic intermediates is occurred 8 distillation technology was efficient for separation of 1 4 dioxane from the aqueous solution due to its high volatility however application of such technology is very expensive and needs high skills for operation 7 8 recently advanced oxidation processes aops was successfully attempted for oxidation of 1 4 dioxane into simple intermediate by products which can further be easily biodegraded via biological treatment methods 1 7 however abdul et al 9 found that the residual fenton s reagents negatively affected the efficiency of post treatment system and caused a toxicity for lemna disperma treating metsulfuron methyl effluent moreover the application of aops is limited due to the production of iron sludge and the ph value of the treated effluent is mainly acidic 10 on the other hand anaerobic degradation of wastewater containing high levels of 1 4 dioxane was failed 3 11 although aerobic treatment processes are capable for removal of 1 4 dioxane from wastewater however disposal process was conducted using pure bacterial cultures i e mycobacterium sp pseudonocardia sp and fungal strain 12 the slow growth rate and little enzymatic affinity for 1 4 dioxane of these bacteria limited their application 13 han et al 14 mentioned that little efforts have been made to develop low cost technologies for treatment of wastewater containing 1 4 dioxane this may be the difficulty of using pure cultures bacteria for upgrading wastewater treatment process and it is not easy to maintain high bacterial cell density in bioreactor to achieve adequate degradation process to overcome such problems and develop a low cost technology for treatment of wastewater containing 1 4 dioxane this study proposes to convert the pollutants into biomass using duckweed where a combination of photo degradation absorption uptake and bacterial degradation might be occurred 15 nowadays duckweed lemna gibba receives a great attention for not only removing of priority pollutants but also for biomass protein starch production and nutrient recovery 16 lemna gibba l gibba species are small floating aquatic plants classified as lemnaceae family and represent cost effective method for wastewater treatment particularly miro pollutants and nutrients removal from industrial wastewater 17 l gibba biomass is ultimately used to feed animals in developing countries due to its high protein content 40 18 moreover 45 of dry weight of l gibba is starch 19 which represents a promising feedstock for bioethanol hydrogen and methane production via anaerobic digestion process 20 21 l gibba successfully metabolized up to 90 of the phenol at retention time of 8 days resulting a more polar and less toxic metabolite 22 pietrini et al 23 performed evidence of ibuprofen ibu absorption by duckweed plants moreover they detected ibu and metabolites in plants tissues and the growth medium in addition baccio et al 24 stated that the contribution of physical chemical degradation of ibu was 8 2 and the major portion of ibu was removed 89 92 5 by l gibba plants diclofenac triclosan and caffeine were completely removed by lemna minor 25 furthermore gatidou et al 26 investigated the fate of benzotriazoles in batch and continuous flow lemna minor systems and found that no inhibition was observed at concentrations up to 200 μg l most of the previous studies were mainly focused on the removal of micro pollutants using l gibba however treatment of polyester wastewater containing 1 4 dioxane has been faced as a black box and the contribution of different mechanisms on 1 4 dioxane removal has not been evaluated yet nevertheless some of the micro pollutants were subjected to hydrolysis photo degradation and reductive transformation 27 while sorption and plant uptake are the most mechanisms removal for the toxic compounds in duckweed systems 28 moreover phytoremediation of water contaminated with 1 4 dioxane in the absence and presence of l gibba have not been identified yet phytoremediation of wastewater rich 1 4 dioxane has been selected for the present investigation due to the limited research information concerning biological fate of 1 4 dioxane in l gibba plants several researchers 27 29 have focused their research on the fate and toxicity of phenol and chlorinated phenols in l gibba but it is hardy to find the removal of 1 4 dioxane using l gibba the aims of the present research are therefore to 1 assess the efficiency of phytoremediation of wastewater rich 1 4 dioxane in baffled and classical duckweed pond system 2 study the mechanism removal of 1 4 dioxane 3 elucidate the pathway route of degradation 1 4 dioxane in l gibba and 4 calculate the economic feasibility of applying such technology for phytoremediation of water contaminated with 1 4 dioxane 2 materials and methods 2 1 characteristics of utilized polyester wastewater retarded polyester wastewater was daily obtained from endmoon factory located in industrial zone of new borg al arab city in year 2018 the generated wastewater after polyester manufacturing accomplished is approximately 10 m3 d containing high toxicants content i e 1 4 dioxane the concentration of 1 4 dioxane was broadly fluctuated from 87 6 377 0 mg l average value was 163 7 74 9 mg l ammonia nh4 n and total phosphorous tp concentrations were varied from 13 4 to 17 9 mg l and from 7 0 to 10 0 mg l respectively with an average nh4 n tp ratio of 1 77 total carbon tc total organic carbon toc and chemical oxygen demand cod were registered average values of 153 5 13 7 72 1 6 1 and 317 4 82 4 mg l respectively moreover initial ph of polyester wastewater is in the range of 2 8 0 2 therefore naoh 10 was supplemented to sustain ph value at a level of 8 0 the heavy metals concentrations in terms of copper cu2 zinc zn2 nickel ni2 and cadmium cd2 were 1 18 0 94 27 16 4 77 4 61 1 24 and 0 037 0 010 mg l respectively 2 2 collection culturing excessive l gibba and reactors start up duckweed lemna gibba species were harvested from el mahmoudia canal behira egypt may 2018 where some industries and domestic municipalities are daily discharged their wastewaters as a result the canal is rich with high content of nutrients which stimulate the heavily growth of l gibba on the surface of the canal the harvested l gibba was initially washed several times with tap water to eliminate alluvium and undesirable dead plants the proposed systems were initially supplied with l gibba density of 600 g fresh weight m2 30 to avoid congestion and hinder excessive algal growth both units were initially fed with water rich nutrients nh4 n 20 and tp 10 mg l for a month afterwards diluted wastewater containing 1 4 dioxane was supplied for the sake of l gibba adaptation prior to start the real experiments 2 3 continuous pilot scale duckweed pond experiment continuous flow un baffled and baffled duckweed ponds dwp bdwp are utilized in this study in which bdwp is composed of three successive units connected in series i e pdwb 1 pdwb 2 and pdwb 3 the units were divided using vertical baffles to 1 promote o2 proliferation inside the wastewater 2 enrich consortium bacteria placed at l gibba s roots 3 enhance the wastewater and l gibba interaction via flow turbulence and 4 reduce the competition behavior of l gibba species for substrate uptake the dimensions of the classical dwp are 1 7 0 3 0 3 m length width and depth with total capacity of 153 l in the case of bdwp 0 55 0 56 and 0 59 m were assigned to the length of 1st 2nd and 3rd compartments as well as each compartment has an opening to investigate the performance profile the ponds were manufactured from impermeable perspex materials to lessen the light penetration consequently algal growth was suppressed peristaltic pump masterflex l s was operated to supply the ponds with constant flow rate of 38 25 l day the applied flow exhibited hydraulic retention time hrt and hydraulic loading rate hlr of 4 days 16 8 h light darkness per day and 75 l m2 day respectively previous study stated that hrt of 4 26 days is the most proper one for duckweed ponds 31 experiments were conducted at room temperature which varied between the range of 18 5 28 0 c for period of 120 days 2 4 removal mechanism of 1 4 dioxane batch experiment batch experiment consisted of four identical reactors was carried out to investigate the fate and removal mechanism of 1 4 dioxane using duckweed plants l gibba table 1 the experiment conducted in triplicate using reactors with capacities of 1000 ml working volume 900 ml operational conditions of ph initial concentration of 1 4 dioxane lemna gibba amount and nutrients n p supplementation were adjusted to 8 0 150 mg l 10 g reactor 22 and 10 mg l respectively incubation temperature was 28 2 c and experiments were extended to consecutive 12 days with samples collection at time intervals of 2 days moreover lighting mode simulated the real condition of 16 h light and 8 h of darkness the 1st and 2nd reactors were operated in the absence of l gibba under dark and light conditions respectively while 3rd and 4th reactors were supplied with inactive and active l gibba pseudo first order kinetics eq 1 were used to describe 1 4 dioxane removal mechanism via duckweed pond where c0 is initial 1 4 dioxane concentrations ct is the final concentration after incubation time t and k is the removal rate constant d 1 1 ct co e kt the hydrolysis kh photo degradation kp sorption ks and plant uptake rate constant ku are calculated based on the following eqs 2 5 32 2 khydrolysis k1 3 kphoto degradation k2 k1 4 ksorption k3 k2 k1 5 kuptake k4 k3 k2 k1 where k1 k2 k3 and k4 are the removal rate constants of 1 4 dioxane obtained by applying eq 1 at reactors 1 2 3 and 4 respectively 2 5 analytical methods thermo scientific orion star a111 model no stara2165 usa was utilized for determining dissolved oxygen do and ph of fifteen samples of the influent and the treated effluents in addition cod total kjeldahl nitrogen tkj n nh4 n no2 n no3 n and tp were measured according to apha 33 gc ms device shimadzu qp2010 ultra japan employed for assessing the concentration of 1 4 dioxane and its metabolite products initially extraction process acquired using methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe then injected to the device with ratio 1 1 2 bromo 1 chloropropane in part per million 20 ppm was utilized as internal standard the injection temperature was 200 c using helium as the carrier gas with 1 ml min of flow rate oven and column temperatures were controlled at 35 c for 7 min and 35 90 c the column flow rate was 20 ml min carbon analyzer shimadzu brand japan was appointed for toc and tc determination duckweed plants were monthly dried in an oven for 24 h at a temperature of 105 c crashed and sieved to harvest an average size of 0 5 mm for further biomass analysis afterwards moisture ash volatile organic matter vom and carbon contents cc as weight percentages were calculated as mentioned at apha 33 furthermore proteins fractions were calculated based on the following equation 6 25 tkj n nh4 n moreover l gibba was hydrolyzed in acid and then the amino acids content in terms of glycine serine aspartic threonine and alanine were quantified via high performance liquid chromatography hplc shimadzu brand japan on the other hand biomass lipids content was obtained according to method declared by verma and suthar 34 in addition the main functional groups of duckweed influent and the treated effluent was evaluated via fourier transform infrared spectroscopy shimadzu ft ir 8400s japan heavy metals concentration such as cu2 zn2 ni2 and cd2 were amounted according to method described by mishra and tripathi 35 using atomic absorption spectrometer b3150060 in markham ontario canada perkinelmer model analyst 200 chlorophyll contents were determined as follows 1 duckweed 50 mg was ground in a solution 3 ml of 80 20 v v ice cold acetone tris buffer solution 2 the resultant was centrifuged for 5 min at 10 000 rpm and 3 absorbance readings associated with the wavelengths of 663 nm for chlorophyll a 647 nm for chlorophyll b 537 nm for anthocyanin and 470 nm for carotenoids were recorded using ultraviolet spectrophotometer additionally growth rate gr g m2 d was evaluated according to the increase of l gibba mass weight per surface area of the pond eq 6 6 gr dw g n d ds m 2 where dw is l gibba s dry weight g n is harvesting days count d ds is the surface area of the duckweed pond m2 statistical analysis was carried out where the data of each experiment was assumed to be independent with different variance 3 results and discussion 3 1 baffling configuration effect of duckweed pond on the treatment efficiency fig 1 a shows the effect of baffling the duckweed pond on the removal efficiency of 1 4 dioxane at constant hrt of 4 days and 1 4 dioxane loading rate of 41 0 g m3 d 1 4 dioxane was significantly p 0 05 degraded with removal efficiency of 69 3 18 6 at bdwp leading to average residual value of 50 2 29 7 mg l this performance surpassed classical dwp which achieved lower removal efficiency of 20 8 11 9 and higher residual value of 1 4 dioxane 115 6 30 7 mg l in the treated effluent fig 1a the superior removal efficiency acquired at bdwp may be related to the high organisms diversity that created favorable conditions for degradation of 1 4 dioxane furthermore baffling of the module increased the do up to 5 4 2 5 mg l in the bulk liquid of bdwp compared to 1 3 0 02 mg l in classical dwp system similarly aitchison et al 36 harvested 1 4 dioxane removal efficiency of 54 19 via hybrid poplar trees under initial 1 4 dioxane concentration and hrt of 23 mg l and 9 days respectively in addition benzotriazoles removal was assessed using continuous flow duckweed lemna minor system with configuration consisted of three ponds connected in serious at overall hrt of 8 3 days and feeding concentration of 200 μg l 4 methyl 1h benzotriazole 4 ttr recorded removal efficiency of 26 while 5 chlorobenzotriazole cbtr attained 72 26 moreover duckweed lemna minor treating mixture of human urine and wastewater 1 200 v v achieved more than 80 removal efficiency for both of ciprofloxacin and sulfamethoxazole 37 on the other hand ph value in the bdwp system was 8 43 0 14 which exceeded the value 8 21 0 06 in the classical dwp this may due to the higher release of carbon dioxide in the bulk liquid located at bdwp which stimulating the photosynthetic activity of plants likewise ran et al 31 found that ph value was increased from 7 9 0 1 in pond 1 9 1 0 2 in pond 3 due to photosynthetic activity of the duckweeds plants as a result ph value recorded at bdwp was at the optimum required level to promote the activity of 1 4 dioxane degrading bacteria for achieving the highest removal efficiency 38 the results in fig 1b c and d show the efficiency of the dwp and bdwp system for removal of cod toc and tc with average influent concentrations of 317 4 82 4 mgcod l 72 1 6 1 mgtoc l and 153 5 13 7 mgtc l respectively bdwp system achieved removal efficiencies of 83 1 7 3 for cod 59 9 11 3 for toc and 44 7 5 8 for tc these results are significantly p 0 01 higher than those obtained for the classical dwp system the residual values of cod toc and tc were 53 7 32 7 28 9 8 4 and 84 7 11 5 mg l respectively in the treated effluent of bdwp system which is complying for discharge into drainage canal this is not the case for the effluent quality of classical dwp where the cod 224 1 45 5 mg l toc 55 2 12 5 mg l and tc 114 0 13 7 mg l exceeded the limits for safely discharge the obtained results are higher than those obtained by gatidou et al 26 who found that the duckweed pond system treating wastewater rich benzotriazoles achieved cod removal efficiency of 54 13 higher cod removal efficiency however exceeded 80 using duckweed lemna minor treating diluted human urine by wastewater with ratio 1 200 37 moreover ran et al 31 discovered that wetland configuration using lemna gibba l at hrt of 4 26 days was able to treat domestic primary effluent achieving quite low suspended solids and organic matter residuals of 13 1 9 7 and 40 3 11 9 mg l respectively fig 3d and table 2 show the removal of ammonia in classical and bdwp system 87 5 6 1 and 47 4 19 1 of ammonia were removed in bdwp and classical dwp resulting effluent qualities of 1 9 0 9 and 7 9 2 8 mg l respectively similar results were observed by mohedano et al 17 who found that the duckweed pond system treating piggery farm effluent removed 98 0 of the tkn with nitrogen removal rate of 4 4 gtkn m2 day at do level of 3 0 mg l besides zhao et al 39 acquired nh4 n removal efficiency of 84 1 during treatment of wastewater rich with benzotriazoles using duckweed pond many mechanisms had been identified for ammonia removal via duckweed pond small portion of ammonia could be volatilized due to flocculation of the wastewater in the bdwp system whereas ammonia volatilization didn t outweigh 1 1 of influent nitrogen concentration when using four compartments duckweed pond for treating domestic wastewater with hrt of 7 days 40 in addition lemna has a great capability for nutrients absorption n and p which accounted for 0 622 and 0 135 g m2 week respectively 41 on the other hand higher dissolved oxygen in the bulk liquid enhances the growth of nitrifying bacteria to oxidize ammonia into nitrite and nitrate 42 a big portion of ammonia was nitrified into nox n no2 no3 in classical dwp system resulting in nitrification efficiency of 48 2 14 5 however lower nitrification efficiency of 28 4 11 4 was recorded in bdwp as shown in table 2 this indicates that the ammonia removal was occurred due to nitrification in classical dwp system while bdwp assigned for nitrification denitrification processes nitrogen balance exhibited that no nitrogen loss was detected in the classical dwp system whereas removed ammonia was converted to nox no2 no3 with effluent concentration of 7 2 mg l in contrast bdwp accounted for 53 0 2 8 of nitrogen loss with effluent nox no2 no3 of 4 3 mg l the higher nitrogen loss in bdwp system is mainly related to the better contact between the wastewater and denitrifiers rested at the bottom of the duckweed pond 43 baffled ponds promote wastewater flocculation from the top to the bottom and vice versa achieving nitrogen removal via denitrification process moreover accumulation of dead duckweed plants in the bottom of the bdwp system stimulates higher denitrification efficiency peng et al 44 stated that nitrification denitrification processes were the reasonable for 38 8 of total n removal while ammonia volatilization accounted for only 2 1 at duckweed pond nevertheless el shafai et al 45 mentioned that 80 of n removal affiliated to l gibba uptake to produce plant protein which surpassed denitrification effect meanwhile both units were efficient for uptake and removal of phosphorous po4 p where 81 4 1 8 and 92 9 2 3 was achieved by classical dwp and bdwp system respectively fig 1e the obtained results agreed with xu and shen 46 where 89 4 of tp from swine wastewater was removed at duckweed system which probably uptake to the build up duckweed biomass besides iatrou et al 15 who found that the average po4 p removal amounted to 81 of the duckweed lemna minor treating antimicrobials wastewater 3 2 profile analysis of baffled duckweed pond bdwp system profile analysis for bdwp is presented at fig 2 apparently the 1st pond acted as the protection shield that adsorb the stressing components i e metals since the initial concentrations of zn2 27 16 4 77 mg l ni2 4 61 1 24 mg l cu2 1 18 0 94 mg l and cd2 0 04 0 01 mg l were declined to 7 86 0 92 71 7 1 57 0 62 65 9 0 14 0 07 88 4 and 0 21 0 01 42 8 mg l respectively at the effluent of the 1st pond fig 2a residuals values of zn2 ni2 cu2 and cd2 at the treated wastewater after passing through the 3rd pond were 1 18 0 58 0 30 0 13 0 08 0 04 and 0 012 0 011 mg l respectively floating species are well known by their ability to adsorb heavy metals 42 in which cu2 plays an important role in metalloenzymes however excessive cu2 could cause a toxicity of the plants and negatively affected physiological biochemical processes and growth of duckweed 47 similar trends were observed by mishra and tripathi 35 where the highest cu2 and cd2 concentrations of 2 75 and 0 39 g kgbiomass were accumulated in the plant tissue at initial concentration of 5 and 2 mg l respectively in this contest cd2 ions are absorbed by roots and translocated into the leaves of the duckweed plants and may affect the growth of photosynthesis chlorophyll fluorescence and nutrient uptake however morphological symptoms such as yellowing and chlorosis of leaves and root shedding were occurred due to cd2 ions toxicity at concentration of 5 0 mg l 35 moreover sekomo et al 30 found that zn2 was removed by value of 70 and 40 at low and high metal loading rates respectively in duckweed treating textile wastewater results emphasized that most of metals were eliminated prior to be introduced to duckweed species at the 2nd and 3rd ponds accumulation of metals on the roots of duckweed at 1st pond limited the uptake of organics i e 1 4 dioxane cod and toc fig 2b despite of the existence of some dead duckweed species at the 1st pond however low growth rate of 2 9 1 9 g m2 d was denoted for this pond which was related to low potential for 1 4 dioxane cod and toc uptake efficiencies of 16 2 5 4 13 1 2 4 and 9 0 1 7 respectively this was not the case for 2nd and 3rd ponds since they were contributed for extra removal efficiencies of 26 1 8 9 26 9 7 4 for 1 4 dioxane 33 5 3 1 36 5 3 7 for cod and 19 6 3 2 31 4 4 7 for toc as a result overall removal efficiencies were amounted to 69 3 18 6 83 1 7 3 and 59 9 11 3 for 1 4 dioxane cod and toc respectively this indicates another benefit behind baffled configuration as the 1st bond alleviates the stress condition for other consecutive ponds 48 49 similar trends were observed by gatidou et al 26 where the removal efficiency of benzotriazoles in duckweed lemna minor was increased from pond 1 3 resulting a maximum removal efficiency of 72 10 likewise the removal efficiencies of nitrogenous fractions were gradually increased from 1st to 3rd pond fig 2c however the big portion of ammonia was oxidized in the 1st pond resulting a residual value of 8 5 0 9 mg l however nloss accounted only for 0 38 0 12 mg l since nh4 n was converted to no2 n and no3 n via nitrification process nh4 n was further declined to 4 8 0 7 and 1 9 0 9 mg l after the 2nd and 3rd pond respectively denitrification process requires nitrates carbon source and anaerobic environment therefore this process mainly took place at the 2nd and 3rd as a result of enforcing the wastewater to pass through the anaerobic zone at the bottom of each pond combined with the abundance of nitrates denitrifiers and carbon source 1 4 dioxane dead duckweed cells 50 this fluctuation at wastewater flow led to nloss amounted to 5 1 3 4 and 8 8 2 2 mg l for 2nd and 3rd ponds respectively fig 2c 3 3 biomass growth composition and characteristics bdwp provided a great potential for phytoremediation of wastewater containing 1 4 dioxane resulting an excellent nutrient removal and biomass production figs 3 and 4 summarized the plant biomass composition of bdwp treating wastewater rich with 1 4 dioxane the results showed that the moisture and dry contents were 94 5 1 2 and 5 5 0 9 respectively the crude protein and carbon contents were the highest components and amounted to 35 8 6 9 and 40 2 10 7 respectively the phosphorus and lipids contents were the lowest fractions as shown in fig 3 similarly zhao et al 51 found that the duckweed composition was 33 34 for protein 25 8 for amino acids 40 19 for starch 1 24 for phosphorus and 2 91 for flavonoids the average growth rate of the duckweed species was 4 8 1 9 g m2 d which is quite similar to those 30 35 g m2 week obtained by xiao et al 41 moreover the authors found that the starch content of the duckweed was maximized at a level of 52 9 due to the capability of the plants for storage and photosynthesis process crude protein and starch content of biomass were reached 31 6 and 47 1 respectively in cultivating duckweed lemna minor treating a mixture of urine and treated domestic wastewater at retention time of 21 d 37 pigments such as chlorophyll a chlorophyll b carotenoids and anthocyanin shown in fig 4 are chemical compounds inside duckweed plant responsible for the adsorbing and reflecting specific wavelengths of sun light into chemical energy in a process called photosynthesis 52 chlorophyll a is the major electron donor at the cellular processes while the remaining compounds are accessory pigments that able to adsorb wider range of light wavelengths and transfer the harvested energy to chlorophyll a to complete the photosynthesis process 29 therefore chlorophyll content considers as important indicator for the photosynthetic potential and the production capacity of plants 53 accordingly these parameters were utilized to investigate the toxicity of 1 4 dioxane on l gibba at bdwp fig 4 showed that the chlorophyll a and b chl a and b were 1 98 0 2 and 0 5 0 02 μmol m2 respectively resulting a total chlorophyll content of 2 48 μmol m2 the ratio of chl a chl b amounted to 3 96 the carotenoids and anthocyanins of the biomass were 0 95 0 03 and 0 6 0 02 μmol m2 as well as the ratio of carotenoids total chlorophyll was calculated to be 0 38 the decrease of chl a chl b ratio and or the increase of carotenoids total chl ratio represent the toxic effect of contaminant on the photosystems 24 consequently the obtained results revealed that l gibba can tolerate 1 4 dioxane without any effect on the chlorophyll a concentration since chl a chl b ratio recorded at our study surpassed 2 72 observed by baccio et al 24 and 3 17 harvested by pietrini et al 23 for control l gibba 3 4 removal mechanism of 1 4 dioxane the results in fig 5 show the removal mechanism of 1 4 dioxane using l gibba the contribution of hydrolysis kh and sorption ks were the lowest removal mechanisms of the 1 4 dioxane where the removal rates were 0 001 0 0005 and 0 008 0 001 d 1 respectively these rates accounted for 1 3 and 10 1 of the total 1 4 dioxane removal efficiency hydrolysis was previously reported as minor importance for removal of antimicrobials i e sulfamethoxazole smx and trimethoprim tri in duckweed lemna minor 54 55 the presence of light enhanced 1 4 dioxane removal efficiency since photo degradation rate kp was 0 016 0 002 d 1 corresponded to 20 3 of 1 4 dioxane degradation however the highest removal rate was assigned for uptake process ku of 0 054 0 003 d 1 68 4 this indicates that the removal mechanism of 1 4 dioxane in this study was mainly due to uptake followed by photo degradation process diffusion of 1 4 dioxane onto the plants tissues is occurred followed by uptake biodegradation metabolism process where these compounds might be degraded via the metabolic processes phytodegradation 27 iatrou et al 15 found that the biodegradation constants of antimicrobials were mainly due to the plant uptake and biodegradation in addition the main removal mechanism of benzotriazoles i e 5 chlorobenzotriazole cbtr in duckweed lemna minor was plant uptake whereas the kinetic constant of plant uptake was by far higher comparing to those of the other removal mechanisms resulting 0 394 0 161 d 1 as reported by gatidou et al 26 moreover the main removal mechanisms for antimicrobial ciprofloxacin and sulfamethoxazole were photo degradation plant uptake and biodegradation process 37 3 5 fate of 1 4 dioxane and fourier transform infrared ftir of biomass fig 6 a shows the ftir analysis of the influent and treated effluent wastewater via bdwp configuration a clear peak of 1 4 dioxane contaminant with high intensity was identified for influent wastewater at frequency of 1385 85 cm 1 this peak was significantly declined in the treated effluent which highlighted the removal efficiency of 1 4 dioxane at the proposed system this was consisted with earlier results obtained by merayo et al 56 however 1 4 dioxane earlier proposed to be oxidized by the aid of filamentous fungi to glycolic acid c2h4o3 and or oxalic acid c2h2o4 57 likewise zhang et al 58 earlier detected ethylene glycol c2h6o2 glyoxylic acid c2h2o3 and oxalic acid as intermediates of 1 4 dioxane biodegradation accompanied with carbon dioxide release these acids mainly have aldehyde functional group cho that contain carbon atom double bonded with oxygen atom co this elucidates the appearance of the peak at frequency of 1631 68 cm 1 at treated effluent wastewater fig 6a where strong peak of co usually located around 1700 cm 1 grostern et al 59 demonstrated the ability of strain cb1190 to sustain its required energy from 1 4 dioxane as carbon source through glyoxylate carboligase pathway where 1 4 dioxane enters central metabolism as three carbon compounds i e phosphoglycerate the utilization of 1 4 dioxane for building new cells is following the pathways of 1 4 dionane glyoxylate glycerate phosphoglycerate pyruvate amino acids in addition compounds with high polarity log kow 1 have high potential to be easily taken up by the roots of the plants 27 in this contest 1 4 dioxane has log kow 0 27 consequently it is proposed that after being taken up into l gibba tissues 1 4 dioxane might be degraded via several metabolic processes incorporation with phytodegradation to pyruvate which further utilize for building up new cells of l gibba the ftir spectra of duckweed biomass is illustrated in fig 6a the graph shows the functional groups of the plant biomass which reveals the conversion of 1 4 dioxane to amino acids the results showed nh stretching at frequency of 3425 08 cm 1 indicating the presence of amino acids in the biomass moreover the fatty acids lipids were appeared at peak of 2925 95 cm 1 due to c h stretching the amide group was detected at 1631 66 cm 1 due to the existing strong co stretching the peaks of 1050 1100 cm 1 showed the presence of hemicelluloses lignin and polysaccharides in the duckweed biomass 60 a weak peak of 524 51 cm 1 was detected due to ß glycosidic linkage of glucose ring to cellulose 61 in order to emphasize the proposed degradation pathways the amino acids in terms of glycine serine aspartic threonine and alanine of the biomass were detected in fig 6b alanine and aspartic were increased by values of 47 3 and 32 5 respectively in the biomass content fed with wastewater containing 1 4 dioxane furthermore glycine and threonine were similarly increased by values of 26 5 and 26 1 respectively serine was the lowest amino acids and increased only by 20 after feeding period of 78 days with wastewater consistently mahendra and alvarez cohen 62 registered an increase in protein content 0 09 gprotein gdioxane using strain cb1190 3 6 economic analysis of the proposed treatment technology full scale baffled duckweed pond was designed to handel polyester wastewater with daily discharge of 10 m3 d the hrt of the proposed pond was 4 days leading to bond s volume of 40 m3 i e 11 m length 4 m width 4 m depth the construction cost and maintance operational costs of biological reactors were assumed as functions of reactor volume 100 150 m3 and daily dischage 0 1 m3 day respectively the pumping cost was determined based on the required energy calculated from eq 7 63 the required pumping energy was accounted for 786 6 kw h year moreover buffering agent is essential to adjust ph value of the inffluent wastewater before being introduced to duckweed pond the annual amount of naoh was accounted for 490 5 kg year 7 pumping energy kw q ρ g h 24 3 6 1 0 3 where q ρ g and h are discharge wastewater density acceleration of the gravity and the maximum required head duckweed has growth rate of 4 8 g m2 d as a result the total daily production of new duckweed species is 105 6 g d these species could further converted to energy in term of bioethanol 64 66 the production cost of ethanol was determine based on data obtained from international renewable energy agency irea as 100 ton of ethanol consequently total periodic cost was amounted to 499 4 year as described at table 3 periodic revenues were determined as the sum of environmental benefits and energy profit environmental benefits came from the disposal of undesirable contaminant i e cod ammonia and phosphorus molinos senante et al 67 previously demonstrated bonuses to save the environment from these pollutants accounted as 0 149 kg codremoved 9 43 kg nh4 nremoved and 1 04 kg premoved respectively moreover ethanol yield from the produced duckweed species was speculated as 0 485 g g 68 this assumption led to daily harvested energy of 1523 7 kj d hence total revenues estimated to be 658 8 year net profit was derived from subtracting the periodic costs from revenues 69 in turn the proposed technology achieved a saving amount of 159 4 year moreover payback period which is the required time span to compensate the construction cost was predestined to be 37 7 years as highlighted in table 3 4 conclusions baffling the duckweed pond modulle improved the removal efficiency of 1 4 dioxane and cod by values of 48 5 and 57 5 respectively likewise 87 5 6 1 and 47 4 19 1 of ammonia was removed in bdwp and classical dwp resulting effluent qualities of 1 9 0 9 and 7 9 2 8 mg l respectively moreover denitrification process took place at baffled configuration due to enforce the wastewater towards anoxic zones at the bottom of the pond the crude protein and carbon contents were the highest components of the biomass and amounted to 35 8 6 9 and 40 2 10 7 respectively the ratio of chl a and b amounted to 3 96 of the duckweed plants which confirmed that 1 4 dioxane didn t hinder the photosynthesis process occurred by plants finally appling the proposed configuration to treat real polyester wastewater will save annually 159 4 year in turn construction costs will be compensated after 37 7 years declaration of competing interest this is to certify that there is no conflict of

14034,lemna gibba l gibba was successfully used for phytoremediation of wastewater rich 1 4 dioxane resulting biomass with high protein and carbon content however the efficiency of l gibba was strongly dependent on the reactor configuration i e classical and baffled duckweed pond dwp bdwp system the bdwp configuration provided a removal efficiency of 69 3 18 6 for 1 4 dioxane resulting a residual value of 50 2 29 7 mg l in the treated effluent the classical dwp module provided a lower removal efficiency of 20 8 11 9 and a higher residual value of 1 4 dioxane 115 6 30 7 mg l in the treated effluent 1 4 dioxane uptake using l gibba was occurred after decomposing into metabolite products in terms of glycolic and oxalic acids afterwards these acids further degraded into phosphoglycerate which easily absorbed by the plants and stored as amino acids in the tissues therefore alanine aspartic acid glycine threonine and serine were boosted by values of 47 3 32 5 26 5 26 1 and 20 respectively the removal mechanism of 1 4 dioxane via duckweed pond was mainly due to uptake followed by photo degradation process economic analysis is clearly emphasized on the applicability of the proposed configuration which achieved net profit and payback period of 159 4 year and 37 7 years respectively keywords phytoremediation micro pollutants lemna gibba uptake degradation photo degradation 1 introduction chemical industries consume considerable quantity of water in the manufacturing processes and produce approximately 70 of wastewater rich with toxic and dangerous pollutants 1 2 unsaturated polyester resin industry generates high strength wastewater containing high levels of 1 4 dioxane nutrients and heavy metals 3 4 1 4 dioxane is commonly utilized as a solvent in many chemical industries therefore 1 4 dioxane residual is produced as contaminant from manufacturing processes this contaminant is non biodegradable toxic hazardous and represents a dangerous priority pollutant wastewater containing 1 4 dioxane is discharged into sewerage network and causes a severe infrastructure environmental damage and toxicity 5 moreover the impurity of drinking water with 1 4 dioxane causes health problems i e cancers as a result eliminating 1 4 dioxane from wastewater is a must 6 adsorption on activated carbon and air striping was not successfully removed 1 4 dioxane from contaminated water due to its high solubility and low vapor pressure 7 oxidation of 1 4 dioxane using chlorine is effective nevertheless formation of toxic intermediates is occurred 8 distillation technology was efficient for separation of 1 4 dioxane from the aqueous solution due to its high volatility however application of such technology is very expensive and needs high skills for operation 7 8 recently advanced oxidation processes aops was successfully attempted for oxidation of 1 4 dioxane into simple intermediate by products which can further be easily biodegraded via biological treatment methods 1 7 however abdul et al 9 found that the residual fenton s reagents negatively affected the efficiency of post treatment system and caused a toxicity for lemna disperma treating metsulfuron methyl effluent moreover the application of aops is limited due to the production of iron sludge and the ph value of the treated effluent is mainly acidic 10 on the other hand anaerobic degradation of wastewater containing high levels of 1 4 dioxane was failed 3 11 although aerobic treatment processes are capable for removal of 1 4 dioxane from wastewater however disposal process was conducted using pure bacterial cultures i e mycobacterium sp pseudonocardia sp and fungal strain 12 the slow growth rate and little enzymatic affinity for 1 4 dioxane of these bacteria limited their application 13 han et al 14 mentioned that little efforts have been made to develop low cost technologies for treatment of wastewater containing 1 4 dioxane this may be the difficulty of using pure cultures bacteria for upgrading wastewater treatment process and it is not easy to maintain high bacterial cell density in bioreactor to achieve adequate degradation process to overcome such problems and develop a low cost technology for treatment of wastewater containing 1 4 dioxane this study proposes to convert the pollutants into biomass using duckweed where a combination of photo degradation absorption uptake and bacterial degradation might be occurred 15 nowadays duckweed lemna gibba receives a great attention for not only removing of priority pollutants but also for biomass protein starch production and nutrient recovery 16 lemna gibba l gibba species are small floating aquatic plants classified as lemnaceae family and represent cost effective method for wastewater treatment particularly miro pollutants and nutrients removal from industrial wastewater 17 l gibba biomass is ultimately used to feed animals in developing countries due to its high protein content 40 18 moreover 45 of dry weight of l gibba is starch 19 which represents a promising feedstock for bioethanol hydrogen and methane production via anaerobic digestion process 20 21 l gibba successfully metabolized up to 90 of the phenol at retention time of 8 days resulting a more polar and less toxic metabolite 22 pietrini et al 23 performed evidence of ibuprofen ibu absorption by duckweed plants moreover they detected ibu and metabolites in plants tissues and the growth medium in addition baccio et al 24 stated that the contribution of physical chemical degradation of ibu was 8 2 and the major portion of ibu was removed 89 92 5 by l gibba plants diclofenac triclosan and caffeine were completely removed by lemna minor 25 furthermore gatidou et al 26 investigated the fate of benzotriazoles in batch and continuous flow lemna minor systems and found that no inhibition was observed at concentrations up to 200 μg l most of the previous studies were mainly focused on the removal of micro pollutants using l gibba however treatment of polyester wastewater containing 1 4 dioxane has been faced as a black box and the contribution of different mechanisms on 1 4 dioxane removal has not been evaluated yet nevertheless some of the micro pollutants were subjected to hydrolysis photo degradation and reductive transformation 27 while sorption and plant uptake are the most mechanisms removal for the toxic compounds in duckweed systems 28 moreover phytoremediation of water contaminated with 1 4 dioxane in the absence and presence of l gibba have not been identified yet phytoremediation of wastewater rich 1 4 dioxane has been selected for the present investigation due to the limited research information concerning biological fate of 1 4 dioxane in l gibba plants several researchers 27 29 have focused their research on the fate and toxicity of phenol and chlorinated phenols in l gibba but it is hardy to find the removal of 1 4 dioxane using l gibba the aims of the present research are therefore to 1 assess the efficiency of phytoremediation of wastewater rich 1 4 dioxane in baffled and classical duckweed pond system 2 study the mechanism removal of 1 4 dioxane 3 elucidate the pathway route of degradation 1 4 dioxane in l gibba and 4 calculate the economic feasibility of applying such technology for phytoremediation of water contaminated with 1 4 dioxane 2 materials and methods 2 1 characteristics of utilized polyester wastewater retarded polyester wastewater was daily obtained from endmoon factory located in industrial zone of new borg al arab city in year 2018 the generated wastewater after polyester manufacturing accomplished is approximately 10 m3 d containing high toxicants content i e 1 4 dioxane the concentration of 1 4 dioxane was broadly fluctuated from 87 6 377 0 mg l average value was 163 7 74 9 mg l ammonia nh4 n and total phosphorous tp concentrations were varied from 13 4 to 17 9 mg l and from 7 0 to 10 0 mg l respectively with an average nh4 n tp ratio of 1 77 total carbon tc total organic carbon toc and chemical oxygen demand cod were registered average values of 153 5 13 7 72 1 6 1 and 317 4 82 4 mg l respectively moreover initial ph of polyester wastewater is in the range of 2 8 0 2 therefore naoh 10 was supplemented to sustain ph value at a level of 8 0 the heavy metals concentrations in terms of copper cu2 zinc zn2 nickel ni2 and cadmium cd2 were 1 18 0 94 27 16 4 77 4 61 1 24 and 0 037 0 010 mg l respectively 2 2 collection culturing excessive l gibba and reactors start up duckweed lemna gibba species were harvested from el mahmoudia canal behira egypt may 2018 where some industries and domestic municipalities are daily discharged their wastewaters as a result the canal is rich with high content of nutrients which stimulate the heavily growth of l gibba on the surface of the canal the harvested l gibba was initially washed several times with tap water to eliminate alluvium and undesirable dead plants the proposed systems were initially supplied with l gibba density of 600 g fresh weight m2 30 to avoid congestion and hinder excessive algal growth both units were initially fed with water rich nutrients nh4 n 20 and tp 10 mg l for a month afterwards diluted wastewater containing 1 4 dioxane was supplied for the sake of l gibba adaptation prior to start the real experiments 2 3 continuous pilot scale duckweed pond experiment continuous flow un baffled and baffled duckweed ponds dwp bdwp are utilized in this study in which bdwp is composed of three successive units connected in series i e pdwb 1 pdwb 2 and pdwb 3 the units were divided using vertical baffles to 1 promote o2 proliferation inside the wastewater 2 enrich consortium bacteria placed at l gibba s roots 3 enhance the wastewater and l gibba interaction via flow turbulence and 4 reduce the competition behavior of l gibba species for substrate uptake the dimensions of the classical dwp are 1 7 0 3 0 3 m length width and depth with total capacity of 153 l in the case of bdwp 0 55 0 56 and 0 59 m were assigned to the length of 1st 2nd and 3rd compartments as well as each compartment has an opening to investigate the performance profile the ponds were manufactured from impermeable perspex materials to lessen the light penetration consequently algal growth was suppressed peristaltic pump masterflex l s was operated to supply the ponds with constant flow rate of 38 25 l day the applied flow exhibited hydraulic retention time hrt and hydraulic loading rate hlr of 4 days 16 8 h light darkness per day and 75 l m2 day respectively previous study stated that hrt of 4 26 days is the most proper one for duckweed ponds 31 experiments were conducted at room temperature which varied between the range of 18 5 28 0 c for period of 120 days 2 4 removal mechanism of 1 4 dioxane batch experiment batch experiment consisted of four identical reactors was carried out to investigate the fate and removal mechanism of 1 4 dioxane using duckweed plants l gibba table 1 the experiment conducted in triplicate using reactors with capacities of 1000 ml working volume 900 ml operational conditions of ph initial concentration of 1 4 dioxane lemna gibba amount and nutrients n p supplementation were adjusted to 8 0 150 mg l 10 g reactor 22 and 10 mg l respectively incubation temperature was 28 2 c and experiments were extended to consecutive 12 days with samples collection at time intervals of 2 days moreover lighting mode simulated the real condition of 16 h light and 8 h of darkness the 1st and 2nd reactors were operated in the absence of l gibba under dark and light conditions respectively while 3rd and 4th reactors were supplied with inactive and active l gibba pseudo first order kinetics eq 1 were used to describe 1 4 dioxane removal mechanism via duckweed pond where c0 is initial 1 4 dioxane concentrations ct is the final concentration after incubation time t and

5 analytical methods thermo scientific orion star a111 model no stara2165 usa was utilized for determining dissolved oxygen do and ph of fifteen samples of the influent and the treated effluents in addition cod total kjeldahl nitrogen tkj n nh4 n no2 n no3 n and tp were measured according to apha 33 gc ms device shimadzu qp2010 ultra japan employed for assessing the concentration of 1 4 dioxane and its metabolite products initially extraction process acquired using methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe then injected to the device with ratio 1 1 2 bromo 1 chloropropane in part per million 20 ppm was utilized as internal standard the injection temperature was 200 c using helium as the carrier gas with 1 ml min of flow rate oven and column temperatures were controlled at 35 c for 7 min and 35 90 c the column flow rate was 20 ml min carbon analyzer shimadzu brand japan was appointed for toc and tc determination duckweed plants were monthly dried in an oven for 24 h at a temperature of 105 c crashed and sieved to harvest an average size of 0 5 mm for further biomass analysis afterwards moisture ash volatile organic matter vom and carbon contents cc as weight percentages were calculated as mentioned at apha 33 furthermore proteins fractions were calculated based on the following equation 6 25 tkj n nh4 n moreover l gibba was hydrolyzed in acid and then the amino acids content in terms of glycine serine aspartic threonine and alanine were quantified via high performance liquid chromatography hplc shimadzu brand japan on the other hand biomass lipids content was obtained according to method declared by verma and suthar 34 in addition the main functional groups of duckweed influent and the treated effluent was evaluated via fourier transform infrared spectroscopy shimadzu ft ir 8400s japan heavy metals concentration such as cu2 zn2 ni2 and cd2 were amounted according to method described by mishra and tripathi 35 using atomic absorption spectrometer b3150060 in markham ontario canada perkinelmer model analyst 200 chlorophyll contents were determined as follows 1 duckweed 50 mg was ground in a solution 3 ml of 80 20 v v ice cold acetone tris buffer solution 2 the resultant was centrifuged for 5 min at 10 000 rpm and 3 absorbance readings associated with the wavelengths of 663 nm for chlorophyll a 647 nm for chlorophyll b 537 nm for anthocyanin and 470 nm for carotenoids were recorded using ultraviolet spectrophotometer additionally growth rate gr g m2 d was evaluated according to the increase of l gibba mass weight per surface area of the pond eq 6 6 gr dw g n d ds m 2 where dw is l gibba s dry weight g n is harvesting days count d ds is the surface area of the duckweed pond m2 statistical analysis was carried out where the data of each experiment was assumed to be independent with different variance 3 results and discussion 3 1 baffling configuration effect of duckweed pond on the treatment efficiency fig 1 a shows the effect of baffling the duckweed pond on the removal efficiency of 1 4 dioxane at constant hrt of 4 days and 1 4 dioxane loading rate of 41 0 g m3 d 1 4 dioxane was significantly p 0 05 degraded with removal efficiency of 69 3 18 6 at bdwp leading to average residual value of 50 2 29 7 mg l this performance surpassed classical dwp which achieved lower removal efficiency of 20 8 11 9 and higher residual value of 1 4 dioxane 115 6 30 7 mg l in the treated effluent fig 1a the superior removal efficiency acquired at bdwp may be related to the high organisms diversity that created favorable conditions for degradation of 1 4 dioxane furthermore baffling of the module increased the do up to 5 4 2 5 mg l in the bulk liquid of bdwp compared to 1 3 0 02 mg l in classical dwp system similarly aitchison et al 36 harvested 1 4 dioxane removal efficiency of 54 19 via hybrid poplar trees under initial 1 4 dioxane concentration and hrt of 23 mg l and 9 days respectively in addition benzotriazoles removal was assessed using continuous flow duckweed lemna minor system with configuration consisted of three ponds connected in serious at overall hrt of 8 3 days and feeding concentration of 200 μg l 4 methyl 1h benzotriazole 4 ttr recorded removal efficiency of 26 while 5 chlorobenzotriazole cbtr attained 72 26 moreover duckweed lemna minor treating mixture of human urine and wastewater 1 200 v v achieved more than 80 removal efficiency for both of ciprofloxacin and sulfamethoxazole 37 on the other hand ph value in the bdwp system was 8 43 0 14 which exceeded the value 8 21 0 06 in the classical dwp this may due to the higher release of carbon dioxide in the bulk liquid located at bdwp which stimulating the photosynthetic activity of plants likewise ran et al 31 found that ph value was increased from 7 9 0 1 in pond 1 9 1 0 2 in pond 3 due to photosynthetic activity of the duckweeds plants as a result ph value recorded at bdwp was at the optimum required level to promote the activity of 1 4 dioxane degrading bacteria for achieving the highest removal efficiency 38 the results in fig 1b c and d show the efficiency of the dwp and bdwp system for removal of cod toc and tc with average influent concentrations of 317 4 82 4 mgcod l 72 1 6 1 mgtoc l and 153 5 13 7 mgtc l respectively bdwp system achieved removal efficiencies of 83 1 7 3 for cod 59 9 11 3 for toc and 44 7 5 8 for tc these results are significantly p 0 01 higher than those obtained for the classical dwp system the residual values of cod toc and tc were 53 7 32 7 28 9 8 4 and 84 7 11 5 mg l respectively in the treated effluent of bdwp system which is complying for discharge into drainage canal this is not the case for the effluent quality of classical dwp where the cod 224 1 45 5 mg l toc 55 2 12 5 mg l and tc 114 0 13 7 mg l exceeded the limits for safely discharge the obtained results are higher than those obtained by gatidou et al 26 who found that the duckweed pond system treating wastewater rich benzotriazoles achieved cod removal efficiency of 54 13 higher cod removal efficiency however exceeded 80 using duckweed lemna minor treating diluted human urine by wastewater with ratio 1 200 37 moreover ran et al 31 discovered that wetland configuration using lemna gibba l at hrt of 4 26 days was able to treat domestic primary effluent achieving quite low suspended solids and organic matter residuals of 13 1 9 7 and 40 3 11 9 mg l respectively fig 3d and table 2 show the removal of ammonia in classical and bdwp system 87 5 6 1 and 47 4 19 1 of ammonia were removed in bdwp and classical dwp resulting effluent qualities of 1 9 0 9 and 7 9 2 8 mg l respectively similar results were observed by mohedano et al 17 who found that the duckweed pond system treating piggery farm effluent removed 98 0 of the tkn with nitrogen removal rate of 4 4 gtkn m2 day at do level of 3 0 mg l besides zhao et al 39 acquired nh4 n removal efficiency of 84 1 during treatment of wastewater rich with benzotriazoles using duckweed pond many mechanisms had been identified for ammonia removal via duckweed pond small portion of ammonia could be volatilized due to flocculation of the wastewater in the bdwp system whereas ammonia volatilization didn t outweigh 1 1 of influent nitrogen concentration when using four compartments duckweed pond for treating domestic wastewater with hrt of 7 days 40 in addition lemna has a great capability for nutrients absorption n and p which accounted for 0 622 and 0 135 g m2 week respectively 41 on the other hand higher dissolved oxygen in the bulk liquid enhances the growth of nitrifying bacteria to oxidize ammonia into nitrite and nitrate 42 a big portion of ammonia was nitrified into nox n no2 no3 in classical dwp system resulting in nitrification efficiency of 48 2 14 5 however lower nitrification efficiency of 28 4 11 4 was recorded in bdwp as shown in table 2 this indicates that the ammonia removal was occurred due to nitrification in classical dwp system while bdwp assigned for nitrification denitrification processes nitrogen balance exhibited that no nitrogen loss was detected in the classical dwp system whereas removed ammonia was converted to nox no2 no3 with effluent concentration of 7 2 mg l in contrast bdwp accounted for 53 0 2 8 of nitrogen loss with effluent nox no2 no3 of 4 3 mg l the higher nitrogen loss in bdwp system is mainly related to the better contact between the wastewater and denitrifiers rested at the bottom of the duckweed pond 43 baffled ponds promote wastewater flocculation from the top to the bottom and vice versa achieving nitrogen removal via denitrification process moreover accumulation of dead duckweed plants in the bottom of the bdwp system stimulates higher denitrification efficiency peng et al 44 stated that nitrification denitrification processes were the reasonable for 38 8 of total n removal while ammonia volatilization accounted for only 2 1 at duckweed pond nevertheless el shafai et al 45 mentioned that 80 of n removal affiliated to l gibba uptake to produce plant protein which surpassed denitrification effect meanwhile both units were efficient for uptake and removal of phosphorous po4 p where 81 4 1 8 and 92 9 2 3 was achieved by classical dwp and bdwp system respectively fig 1e the obtained results agreed with xu and shen 46 where 89 4 of tp from swine wastewater was removed at duckweed system which probably uptake to the build up duckweed biomass besides iatrou et al 15 who found that the average po4 p removal amounted to 81 of the duckweed lemna minor treating antimicrobials wastewater 3 2 profile analysis of baffled duckweed pond bdwp system profile analysis for bdwp is presented at fig 2 apparently the 1st pond acted as the protection shield that adsorb the stressing components i e metals since the initial concentrations of zn2 27 16 4 77 mg l ni2 4 61 1 24 mg l cu2 1 18 0 94 mg l and cd2 0 04 0 01 mg l were declined to 7 86 0 92 71 7 1 57 0 62 65 9 0 14 0 07 88 4 and 0 21 0 01 42 8 mg l respectively at the effluent of the 1st pond fig 2a residuals values of zn2 ni2 cu2 and cd2 at the treated wastewater after passing through the 3rd pond were 1 18 0 58 0 30 0 13 0 08 0 04 and 0 012 0 011 mg l respectively floating species are well known by their ability to adsorb heavy metals 42 in which cu2 plays an important role in metalloenzymes however excessive cu2 could cause a toxicity of the plants and negatively affected physiological biochemical processes and growth of duckweed 47 similar trends were observed by mishra and tripathi 35 where the highest cu2 and cd2 concentrations of 2 75 and 0 39 g kgbiomass were accumulated in the plant tissue at initial concentration of 5 and 2 mg l respectively in this contest cd2 ions are absorbed by roots and translocated into the leaves of the duckweed plants and may affect the growth of photosynthesis chlorophyll fluorescence and nutrient uptake however morphological symptoms such as yellowing and chlorosis of leaves and root shedding were occurred due to cd2 ions toxicity at concentration of 5 0 mg l 35 moreover sekomo et al 30 found that zn2 was removed by value of 70 and 40 at low and high metal loading rates respectively in duckweed treating textile wastewater results emphasized that most of metals were eliminated prior to be introduced to duckweed species at the 2nd and 3rd ponds accumulation of metals on the roots of duckweed at 1st pond limited the uptake of organics i e 1 4 dioxane cod and toc fig 2b despite of the existence of some dead duckweed species at the 1st pond however low growth rate of 2 9 1 9 g m2 d was denoted for this pond which was related to low potential for 1 4 dioxane cod and toc uptake efficiencies of 16 2 5 4 13 1 2 4 and 9 0 1 7 respectively this was not the case for 2nd and 3rd ponds since they were contributed for extra removal efficiencies of 26 1 8 9 26 9 7 4 for 1 4 dioxane 33 5 3 1 36 5 3 7 for cod and 19 6 3 2 31 4 4 7 for toc as a result overall removal efficiencies were amounted to 69 3 18 6 83 1 7 3 and 59 9 11 3 for 1 4 dioxane cod and toc respectively this indicates another benefit behind baffled configuration as the 1st bond alleviates the stress condition for other consecutive ponds 48 49 similar trends were observed by gatidou et al 26 where the removal efficiency of benzotriazoles in duckweed lemna minor was increased from pond 1 3 resulting a maximum removal efficiency of 72 10 likewise the removal efficiencies of nitrogenous fractions were gradually increased from 1st to 3rd pond fig 2c however the big portion of ammonia was oxidized in the 1st pond resulting a residual value of 8 5 0 9 mg l however nloss accounted only for 0 38 0 12 mg l since nh4 n was converted to no2 n and no3 n via nitrification process nh4 n was further declined to 4 8 0 7 and 1 9 0 9 mg l after the 2nd and 3rd pond respectively denitrification process requires nitrates carbon source and anaerobic environment therefore this process mainly took place at the 2nd and 3rd as a result of enforcing the wastewater to pass through the anaerobic zone at the bottom of each pond combined with the abundance of nitrates denitrifiers and carbon source 1 4 dioxane dead duckweed cells 50 this fluctuation at wastewater flow led to nloss amounted to 5 1 3 4 and 8 8 2 2 mg l for 2nd and 3rd ponds respectively fig 2c 3 3 biomass growth composition and characteristics bdwp provided a great potential for phytoremediation of wastewater containing 1 4 dioxane resulting an excellent nutrient removal and biomass production figs 3 and 4 summarized the plant biomass composition of bdwp treating wastewater rich with 1 4 dioxane the results showed that the moisture and dry contents were 94 5 1 2 and 5 5 0 9 respectively the crude protein and carbon contents were the highest components and amounted to 35 8 6 9 and 40 2 10 7 respectively the phosphorus and lipids contents were the lowest fractions as shown in fig 3 similarly zhao et al 51 found that the duckweed composition was 33 34 for protein 25 8 for amino acids 40 19 for starch 1 24 for phosphorus and 2 91 for flavonoids the average growth rate of the duckweed species was 4 8 1 9 g m2 d which is quite similar to those 30 35 g m2 week obtained by xiao et al 41 moreover the authors found that the starch content of the duckweed was maximized at a level of 52 9 due to the capability of the plants for storage and photosynthesis process crude protein and starch content of biomass were reached 31 6 and 47 1 respectively in cultivating duckweed lemna minor treating a mixture of urine and treated domestic wastewater at retention time of 21 d 37 pigments such as chlorophyll a chlorophyll b carotenoids and anthocyanin shown in fig 4 are chemical compounds inside duckweed plant responsible for the adsorbing and reflecting specific wavelengths of sun light into chemical energy in a process called photosynthesis 52 chlorophyll a is the major electron donor at the cellular processes while the remaining compounds are accessory pigments that able to adsorb wider range of light wavelengths and transfer the harvested energy to chlorophyll a to complete the photosynthesis process 29 therefore chlorophyll content considers as important indicator for the photosynthetic potential and the production capacity of plants 53 accordingly these parameters were utilized to investigate the toxicity of 1 4 dioxane on l gibba at bdwp fig 4 showed that the chlorophyll a and b chl a and b were 1 98 0 2 and 0 5 0 02 μmol m2 respectively resulting a total chlorophyll content of 2 48 μmol m2 the ratio of chl a chl b amounted to 3 96 the carotenoids and anthocyanins of the biomass were 0 95 0 03 and 0 6 0 02 μmol m2 as well as the ratio of carotenoids total chlorophyll was calculated to be 0 38 the decrease of chl a chl b ratio and or the increase of carotenoids total chl ratio represent the toxic effect of contaminant on the photosystems 24 consequently the obtained results revealed that l gibba can tolerate 1 4 dioxane without any effect on the chlorophyll a concentration since chl a chl b ratio recorded at our study surpassed 2 72 observed by baccio et al 24 and 3 17 harvested by pietrini et al 23 for control l gibba 3 4 removal mechanism of 1 4 dioxane the results in fig 5 show the removal mechanism of 1 4 dioxane using l gibba the contribution of hydrolysis kh and sorption ks were the lowest removal mechanisms of the 1 4 dioxane where the removal rates were 0 001 0 0005 and 0 008 0 001 d 1 respectively these rates accounted for 1 3 and 10 1 of the total 1 4 dioxane removal efficiency hydrolysis was previously reported as minor importance for removal of antimicrobials i e sulfamethoxazole smx and trimethoprim tri in duckweed lemna minor 54 55 the presence of light enhanced 1 4 dioxane removal efficiency since photo degradation rate kp was 0 016 0 002 d 1 corresponded to 20 3 of 1 4 dioxane degradation however the highest removal rate was assigned for uptake process ku of 0 054 0 003 d 1 68 4 this indicates that the removal mechanism of 1 4 dioxane in this study was mainly due to uptake followed by photo degradation process diffusion of 1 4 dioxane onto the plants tissues is occurred followed by uptake biodegradation metabolism process where these compounds might be degraded via the metabolic processes phytodegradation 27 iatrou et al 15 found that the biodegradation constants of antimicrobials were mainly due to the plant uptake and biodegradation in addition the main removal mechanism of benzotriazoles i e 5 chlorobenzotriazole cbtr in duckweed lemna minor was plant uptake whereas the kinetic constant of plant uptake was by far higher comparing to those of the other removal mechanisms resulting 0 394 0 161 d 1 as reported by gatidou et al 26 moreover the main removal mechanisms for antimicrobial ciprofloxacin and sulfamethoxazole were photo degradation plant uptake and biodegradation process 37 3 5 fate of 1 4 dioxane and fourier transform infrared ftir of biomass fig 6 a shows the ftir analysis of the influent and treated effluent wastewater via bdwp configuration a clear peak of 1 4 dioxane contaminant with high intensity was identified for influent wastewater at frequency of 1385 85 cm 1 this peak was significantly declined in the treated effluent which highlighted the removal efficiency of 1 4 dioxane at the proposed system this was consisted with earlier results obtained by merayo et al 56 however 1 4 dioxane earlier proposed to be oxidized by the aid of filamentous fungi to glycolic acid c2h4o3 and or oxalic acid c2h2o4 57 likewise zhang et al 58 earlier detected ethylene glycol c2h6o2 glyoxylic acid c2h2o3 and oxalic acid as intermediates of 1 4 dioxane biodegradation accompanied with carbon dioxide release these acids mainly have aldehyde functional group cho that contain carbon atom double bonded with oxygen atom co this elucidates the appearance of the peak at frequency of 1631 68 cm 1 at treated effluent wastewater fig 6a where strong peak of co usually located around 1700 cm 1 grostern et al 59 demonstrated the ability of strain cb1190 to sustain its required energy from 1 4 dioxane as carbon source through glyoxylate carboligase pathway where 1 4 dioxane enters central metabolism as three carbon compounds i e phosphoglycerate the utilization of 1 4 dioxane for building new cells is following the pathways of 1 4 dionane glyoxylate glycerate phosphoglycerate pyruvate amino acids in addition compounds with high polarity log kow 1 have high potential to be easily taken up by the roots of the plants 27 in this contest 1 4 dioxane has log kow 0 27 consequently it is proposed that after being taken up into l gibba tissues 1 4 dioxane might be degraded via several metabolic processes incorporation with phytodegradation to pyruvate which further utilize for building up new cells of l gibba the ftir spectra of duckweed biomass is illustrated in fig 6a the graph shows the functional groups of the plant biomass which reveals the conversion of 1 4 dioxane to amino acids the results showed nh stretching at frequency of 3425 08 cm 1 indicating the presence of amino acids in the biomass moreover the fatty acids lipids were appeared at peak of 2925 95 cm 1 due to c h stretching the amide group was detected at 1631 66 cm 1 due to the existing strong co stretching the peaks of 1050 1100 cm 1 showed the presence of hemicelluloses lignin and polysaccharides in the duckweed biomass 60 a weak peak of 524 51 cm 1 was detected due to ß glycosidic linkage of glucose ring to cellulose 61 in order to emphasize the proposed degradation pathways the amino acids in terms of glycine serine aspartic threonine and alanine of the biomass were detected in fig 6b alanine and aspartic were increased by values of 47 3 and 32 5 respectively in the biomass content fed with wastewater containing 1 4 dioxane furthermore glycine and threonine were similarly increased by values of 26 5 and 26 1 respectively serine was the lowest amino acids and increased only by 20 after feeding period of 78 days with wastewater consistently mahendra and alvarez cohen 62 registered an increase in protein content 0 09 gprotein gdioxane using strain cb1190 3 6 economic analysis of the proposed treatment technology full scale baffled duckweed pond was designed to handel polyester wastewater with daily discharge of 10 m3 d the hrt of the proposed pond was 4 days leading to bond s volume of 40 m3 i e 11 m length 4 m width 4 m depth the construction cost and maintance operational costs of biological reactors were assumed as functions of reactor volume 100 150 m3 and daily dischage 0 1 m3 day respectively the pumping cost was determined based on the required energy calculated from eq 7 63 the required pumping energy was accounted for 786 6 kw h year moreover buffering agent is essential to adjust ph value of the inffluent wastewater before being introduced to duckweed pond the annual amount of naoh was accounted for 490 5 kg year 7 pumping energy kw q ρ g h 24 3 6 1 0 3 where q ρ g and h are discharge wastewater density acceleration of the gravity and the maximum required head duckweed has growth rate of 4 8 g m2 d as a result the total daily production of new duckweed species is 105 6 g d these species could further converted to energy in term of bioethanol 64 66 the production cost of ethanol was determine based on data obtained from international renewable energy agency irea as 100 ton of ethanol consequently total periodic cost was amounted to 499 4 year as described at table 3 periodic revenues were determined as the sum of environmental benefits and energy profit environmental benefits came from the disposal of undesirable contaminant i e cod ammonia and phosphorus molinos senante et al 67 previously demonstrated bonuses to save the environment from these pollutants accounted as 0 149 kg codremoved 9 43 kg nh4 nremoved and 1 04 kg premoved respectively moreover ethanol yield from the produced duckweed species was speculated as 0 485 g g 68 this assumption led to daily harvested energy of 1523 7 kj d hence total revenues estimated to be 658 8 year net profit was derived from subtracting the periodic costs from revenues 69 in turn the proposed technology achieved a saving amount of 159 4 year moreover payback period which is the required time span to compensate the construction cost was predestined to be 37 7 years as highlighted in table 3 4 conclusions baffling the duckweed pond modulle improved the removal efficiency of 1 4 dioxane and cod by values of 48 5 and 57 5 respectively likewise 87 5 6 1 and 47 4 19 1 of ammonia was removed in bdwp and classical dwp resulting effluent qualities of 1 9 0 9 and 7 9 2 8 mg l respectively moreover denitrification process took place at baffled configuration due to enforce the wastewater towards anoxic zones at the bottom of the pond the crude protein and carbon contents were the highest components of the biomass and amounted to 35 8 6 9 and 40 2 10 7 respectively the ratio of chl a and b amounted to 3 96 of the duckweed plants which confirmed that 1 4 dioxane didn t hinder the photosynthesis process occurred by plants finally appling the proposed configuration to treat real polyester wastewater will save annually 159 4 year in turn construction costs will be compensated after 37 7 years declaration of competing interest this is to certify that there is no conflict of
