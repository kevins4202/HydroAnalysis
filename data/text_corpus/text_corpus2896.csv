more attention owing to its high efficiency non secondary pollution and easy control of reaction conditions 17 20 cps can be reduced via electrocatalytic hydrogenolysis ech chlorine atoms on aromatic

rgo in 0 1 wt nafion ethanol solution the suspension was then sonicated for 30 min to ensure that it was homogeneous a dip coating method was used to loaded rgo on the pretreated ti mesh the pretreated ti mesh was used as substrate for dipping into the suspension for 15 s withdrawn at a speed of 1 cm s 1 and then dried completely under ambient condition after several repeated cycles the rgo nafion ti supporting electrode was obtained then the rgo nafion ti supporting electrode was used as cathode and a pt foil was used as anode for pd particles deposition under a constant current to prepare pd rgo nafion ti electrode the plating solution was pdcl2 solution containing surfactant ctab 20 mol l 1 for comparison a pd ti electrode was synthesized by electro deposition of pd particles on ti mesh under the same preparation conditions without modified with rgo nafion middle layer 2 3 dechlorination experiments electrochemical degradation of 3 5 dcp and 2 3 5 tcp was carried out at a

chromatograph ic metrohm switzerland with a metrohm metrosep a supp 5 150 4 0 anion separation column was used for analyzing the chlorine ion content in catholyte the conversion efficiency and current efficiency for dechlorination of 3 5 dcp and 2 3 5 tcp were calculated by the equations as described in articles 34 3 results and discussion 3 1 cyclic voltammetry analysis rgo nafion layer was covered on the ti mesh surface to prepare rgo nafion ti supporting electrode via dip coating method the effects of rgo concentration in suspension and repeat times of dip coating on the dip coating of rgo nafion layer were analyzed by electrochemical workstation and the cv test results are shown in fig 1 the effect of rgo content in suspension was investigated under repetitions of three fig 1 a shows cv curves of pure ti mesh and rgo nafion ti supporting electrode prepared at different rgo concentrations 0 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 and 1 0 g l 1 as the figure shows the hydrogen adsorption peak current of rgo nafion ti supporting electrodes at about 650 mv were larger than that of pure ti mesh indicating that rgo nafion layer can improve the hydrogen adsorption ability of the electrode the hydrogen adsorption peak current of rgo nafion ti supporting electrode reached maximum when the rgo concentration was 0 8 g l 1 the excessive rgo decreased the stability of rgo nafion layer on the surface of ti mesh or even fell off from ti mesh therefore rgo concentration of 0 8 g l 1 was selected for the preparation of rgo nafion ti supporting electrode the effect of repeat times of dip coating was then studied under rgo concentration of 0 8 g l 1 fig 1 b shows cv curves of rgo nafion ti supporting electrode prepared at different repeat times of dip coating 1 3 5 7 and 9 as can be seen from the figure the hydrogen adsorption peak current reached maximum at 7 times of dip coating the rgo nafion layer was too thick when dip coating was more than 7 times which resulted in the decrease of stability and specific surface area of supporting electrode thus 7 times of dip coating were selected as the optimal times of dip coating for the rgo nafion ti supporting electrode preparation in summary rgo concentration of 0 8 g l 1 and 7 times of dip coating were selected as the dip coating conditions for coating the rgo nafion layer on the surface of ti mesh subsequently pd rgo nafion ti electrode was synthesized via electro depositing pd particles on rgo nafion ti supporting electrode the effects of pd2 concentration ph of pdcl2 solution and electro deposition current and time on electro deposition were analyzed by cv and the cv test results are shown in fig 2 under an electro deposition current of 20 ma a pdcl2 solution ph of 0 3 and an electro deposition time of 30 min the effect of pd2 concentration was investigated cv curves of pd rgo nafion ti electrode prepared at different pd2 concentrations 2 5 7 10 and 15 mmol l 1 are shown in fig 2 a when the pd2 concentration increased from 2 to 5 mmol l 1 the hydrogen adsorption peak current reached 70 2 ma with further increase of the pd2 concentration to 7 10 or 15 mmol l 1 hydrogen adsorption peak currents were lower than that of 5 mmol l 1 therefore 5 mmol l 1 was chosen as the pd2 concentration for pd particles electro deposition under the selected pd2 concentration of 5 mmol l 1 the effect of the pdcl2 solution ph was analyzed at an electro deposition current of 20 ma and time of 30 min cv curves of pd rgo nafion ti electrode under different ph 0 1 0 3 0 5 0 7 and 1 1 are shown in fig 2 b it can be seen that the ph had less effect on the hydrogen adsorption capacity of electrode and the maximal hydrogen adsorption peak current of 70 4 ma was obtained with the pdcl2 solution ph of 0 3 therefore ph of 0 3 was selected as the optimum parameter for the pd particles load and subsequent experiments the effect of electro deposition current was investigated at a pd2 concentration of 5 mmol l 1 pdcl2 solution ph of 0 3 and electro deposition time of 30 min the cv curves of pd rgo nafion ti electrode at different electro deposition currents 20 30 40 50 and 60 ma are shown in fig 2 c the maximal hydrogen adsorption peak current of 127 0 ma was achieved at electro deposition current of 50 ma under higher electro deposition current than 50 ma electrode became unstable due to the formation of oversized pd particles on the surface and pd particles fell off from the electrode surface easily conversely under lower electro deposition current the loading amounts of pd particles was insufficient and the hydrogen adsorption peak current of electrode reduced finally the effect of electro deposition time was investigated under pd2 concentration of 5 mmol l 1 pdcl2 solution ph of 0 3 and electro deposition current of 50 ma fig 2 d shows cv curves of pd rgo nafion ti electrode prepared at different electro deposition time 15 30 45 60 and 75 min the hydrogen adsorption peak current of pd rgo nafion ti electrode increased with the electro deposition time increased from 15 to 60 min and then decreased when the electro deposition time reached 75 min at the longer time for pd particles electro deposition pd particles agglomerated and formed over thick pd layer on the surface resulting decrease of stability and specific surface area of electrode at the shorter electro deposition time the insufficient pd particles on electrode surface reduced hydrogen adsorption capacity of electrode to summarize the optimum electro deposition conditions of pd particles were achieved i e pd2 concentration of 5 mmol l 1 ph of 0 3 electro deposition current of 50 ma and time of 60 min under these conditions the hydrogen adsorption peak current of pd rgo nafion ti electrode was 181 2 ma compared to the pd cnts nafion film ti electrode prepared in our previous study the hydrogen adsorption peak current increased by 7 9 ma 34 it indicated that graphene can increase the hydrogen adsorption performance of the electrode more than carbon nanotubes fig 3 shows the cv curves of pd ti electrode and pd rgo nafion ti electrode after coating with rgo nafion middle layer the hydrogen adsorption peak current of pd rgo nafion ti electrode was 53 6 ma larger than that of pd ti electrode 127 6 ma results indicated that the presence of rgo nafion layer improved the hydrogen adsorption capacity of electrode and the catalytic activity of pd particles owing to the unique properties of rgo and nafion 47 3 2 characterization of electrodes the surface morphologies of ti mesh rgo nafion ti supporting electrode and pd rgo nafion ti electrode were studied by sem fig 4 a shows that pretreated ti mesh exhibited rough surface might which was beneficial to load rgo fig 4 b shows that rgo covered on the ti mesh surface uniformly improving the specific surface area of electrode and providing more attachment sites for loading of pd particles fig 4 c and d show the surface morphologies of pd rgo nafion ti electrode at different magnifications a great deal of pd particles protuberances were deposited on the surface of electrode uniformly fig 4 c as can be seen from fig 4 d the pd particles had accumulational flake like structures which improved specific surface areas and provided more catalytic active sites for dechlorination through the analysis of icp aes the pd content of pd rgo nafion ti electrode was 3 85 mg cm 2 fig 5 shows the xrd pattern of pd rgo nafion ti electrode prepared under optimal conditions the diffraction peaks at 2θ values of 40 2 46 8 68 2 82 2 and 86 7 are indexed to the 111 200 220 311 and 222 planes of pd jcpds 46 1043 pd0 particles exhibited face centered cubic fcc crystal structure on the surface of electrode the size of the pd crystallites was 14 0 nm by calculating using the scherrer formula 48 the chemical composition of pd rgo nafion ti electrode was examined by xps measurements the xps spectra of survey for electrode and pd 3d are shown in fig 6 the peaks of o 1 s pd 3d and c 1 s were observed in the electrode from xps survey spectrum fig 6 a indicating that pd was electrodeposited on the electrode surface successfully fig 6 b shows the pd 3d spectrum the significant peaks at 340 4 ev i and 335 1 ev ii are corresponding to the characteristic binding energy be values of pd0 3d3 2 and pd0 3d5 2 respectively 49 the small peaks located at higher binding energy be values of 341 9 ev iii and 336 7 ev iv are corresponding to pd2 3d3 2 and pd2 3d5 2 respectively the relative content of pd0 for pd rgo nafion ti electrode was higher than that of pd2 remarkably indicating that metallic pd0 was the dominant component at the electrode surface rather than oxides 3 3 electrocatalytic dechlorination the pd rgo nafion ti electrode prepared under the optimal conditions was used as cathode to degrade 3 5 dcp and 2 3 5 tcp under constant current respectively the effects of dechlorination current and initial ph were investigated in 100 mg l 1 chlorophenol solution 3 3 1 effect of dechlorination current the effects of dechlorination current on the conversion efficiency and the current efficiency of 3 5 dcp dechlorination were conducted at varying currents 2 5 8 and 10 ma with the catholyte ph of 4 3 and the results are shown in as observed from fig 7 a the 3 5 dcp conversion efficiency was only 11 7 after dechlorination for 90 min under the dechlorination current of 2 ma which due to the insufficient of hads amounts at a lower dechlorination current the 3 5 dcp conversion efficiency reached 76 5 at a current of 5 ma while the conversion efficiencies decreased to 60 5 and 39 0 at higher currents of 8 ma and 10 ma respectively this phenomenon was attributed to the inhibitory effect of her under the higher current under an excessively high current the generation rate of h2 from hads was greater than the dechlorination rate of 3 5 dcp with hads causing that the catalytic active sites on the electrode surface were covered by h2 and the amount of hads required for the dechlorination was insufficient fig 7 b shows the trend of changes in the current efficiency under different dechlorination currents as observed the current efficiency of the 3 5 dcp dechlorination conducted at 2 ma increased gradually at dechlorination currents of 5 ma and 8 ma the current efficiencies during the degradation increased rapidly first and then decreased the current efficiency of the 3 5 dcp dechlorination conducted at 10 ma decreased gradually during whole process after 90 min of reaction the dechlorination current efficiency increased gradually with the dechlorination current increased to 5 ma and then decreased as the dechlorination currents continued to increase to 8 ma and 10 ma the maximum current efficiency of 18 5 was achieved at the dechlorination current of 5 ma therefore current of 5 ma was elected for dechlorination and subsequent studies similarly the effects of dechlorination current on the conversion efficiency and current efficiency of 2 3 5 tcp dechlorination were also investigated at varying currents 3 5 7 and 9 ma with the catholyte ph of 5 7 the results are shown in fig 8 the maximum conversion efficiency of 42 5 and current efficiency of 9 7 were reached under the dechlorination current of 5 ma a current of 5 ma was selected through the optimization of reaction conditions 3 3 2 effect of initial ph under the current of 5 ma the dechlorination of 3 5 dcp was examined under different initial ph values of reaction solution 1 3 2 3 4 3 5 3 and 9 3 as can be seen from fig 9 a after reaction for 90 min the conversion efficiencies of 3 5 dcp could reach to 100 under initial ph of 1 3 and 2 3 however the conversion efficiencies decreased remarkably when the initial ph increased to 4 3 and 5 3 furthermore only 36 0 of 3 5 dcp was converted when the catholyte solution initial ph was alkaline ph 9 3 this result indicated that the lower ph was beneficial for 3 5 dcp dechlorination owing to the high yield of hads at a lower ph which could enhance the ech process 50 fig 9 b shows the trend of changes in current efficiencies during the dechlorination reaction under different initial ph as observed the current efficiencies increased during the initial period of the reaction and then gradually decreased after 90 min the current efficiency of 3 5 dcp dechlorination increased when the initial ph increased from 1 3 to 2 3 and then decreased as initial ph continued to rise the current efficiency reached maximum value 23 6 at initial ph of 2 3 after 90 min taking into account the results of conversion efficiency and current efficiency initial ph of 2 3 was selected for 3 5 dcp electrocatalytic dechlorination similarly the effects of initial ph on the dechlorination of 2 3 5 tcp were also investigated at varying initial ph 1 6 2 3 3 4 5 7 and 9 7 with the current of 5 ma and the results are shown in fig 10 a ph of 2 3 was selected as the initial ph through the optimization of reaction conditions at this initial ph value the conversion efficiency and current efficiency of 2 3 5 tcp after 90 min reached 100 and 26 1 respectively under the current of 5 ma and the initial ph of 2 3 3 5 dcp and 2 3 5 tcp dechlorination were carried out on ti mesh rgo nafion ti and pd ti electrode to investigate the effect of rgo nafion layer on dechlorination the conversion efficiencies of 3 5 dcp and 2 3 5 tcp on ti mesh were only 26 8 and 15 4 respectively see fig s1 in supplementary material after being modified with rgo nafion middle layer the conversion efficiencies of 3 5 dcp and 2 3 5 tcp on rgo nafion ti electrode increased to 34 6 and 24 8 respectively the conversion efficiencies of 3 5 dcp and 2 3 5 tcp on pd ti electrode reached 96 3 and 92 1 after 90 min respectively which were lower than that on pd rgo nafion ti electrode the results show that rgo nafion layer can improve the electrocatalytic activity of electrode comparison of the electrocatalytic performance on chlorophenol electrochemical reduction to that of other electrodes from other literatures was summarized in table 2 it showed that the pd rgo nafion ti electrode had higher competitive and promising on dechlorination of chlorophenol 3 3 3 dechlorination products of 3 5 dcp and 2 3 5 tcp the concentration of dechlorination intermediates and products were determined by hplc fig 11 a shows the contents of 3 5 dcp and products within 90 min of 3 5 dcp electrolysis on pd rgo nafion ti electrode under the selected dechlorination conditions current of 5 ma and initial ph of 2 3 the concentration of 3 5 dcp decreased rapidly within 0 40 min and then decreased gently within 40 90 min until complete degradation the concentration of dechlorination intermediates 3 chlorophenol 3 cp increased to 4 2 mg l 1 at the reaction time of 20 min followed by a decline after 70 min of reaction 3 cp was completely decomposed the concentration of phenol increased gradually within 0 60 min and reached 56 1 mg l 1 and then decreased slowly after 60 min indicating that phenol could be further decomposed 56 the amounts of 2 3 5 tcp and dechlorination products during the 2 3 5 tcp dechlorination process on pd rgo nafion ti electrode under the selected dechlorination conditions at room temperature are shown in fig 11 b as the reaction progresses the concentration of 2 3 5 tcp continued to decrease and could be converted completely after 90 min in the initial 30 min of the reaction the concentration of 2 3 dichlorophenol 2 3 dcp increased gradually and the concentration decreased subsequently at 30 80 min the change in 2 5 dichlorophenol 2 5 dcp concentration also has a similar trend the concentration increased within the initial 40 min and decreased gradually within 40 80 min after 80 min of reaction 2 3 dcp and 2 5 dcp were decomposed completely due to the effect of intramolecular hydrogen bonding and steric interaction on the aromatic ring of 2 3 5 tcp the chlorine atom at ortho position is substituted harder than that at meta position 57 which resulted in that 3 5 dichlorophenol 3 5 dcp was not generated during the ech process with the reaction going 2 chlorophenol 2 cp was detected after 20 min of dechlorination which indicated that the chlorine atoms on the dichlorophenols could be further removed the concentration of phenol rose to a maximum at 40 min of reaction and then gradually decreased until it was completely degraded at 90 min the content of phenol increased during the initial 80 min and decreased slowly after 80 min the ratios of chlorinated phenolic intermediates and phenol at different reaction times are showed in table s1 and s2 see in supplementary material the cl concentrations of 3 5 dcp and 2 3 5 tcp dechlorination were determined by ic as the reaction progressed the cl concentrations rose to 42 5 3 5 dcp dechlorination and 53 7 mg l 1 2 3 5 tcp dechlorination respectively fig 12 a and b solid curve the measured values were consistent with the theoretical values of cl generated upon complete dechlorination fig 12 a and b dashed line indicating that chlorine atoms on the chlorophenol molecules could be completely removed at 90 min 3 3 4 the kinetics of dechlorination the kinetics of electrocatalytic dechlorination of 3 5 dcp and 2 3 5 tcp were carried out at varying temperatures 288 298 308 and 318 k under the optimal reaction conditions i e current of 5 ma and initial ph of 2 3 fig 13 a and b show the different kinetic fitting curves of 3 5 dcp as can be seen from fig 13 a there is a good linear relationship between 3 5 dcp concentration ct and reaction time at the initial reaction time 0 30 min however a good linear relationship exists between ln ct and the reaction time within 30 90 min fig 13 b therefore it could be inferred that electrocatalytic dechlorination of 3 5 dcp on pd rgo nafion ti electrode followed a pseudo zero order kinetics at the beginning of the reaction and followed a pseudo first order kinetics at the later stage of the reaction the rate constant at 288 298 308 and 318 k were 2 5111 2 8025 3 1795 and 3 2026 mg l 1 min 1 within 0 30 min and 0 0706 0 1035 0 1782 and 0 1918 min 1 in 30 90 min fig 13 c and d show the reaction kinetic fitting curves of 2 3 5 tcp dechlorination at different time periods similarly the dechlorination process of 2 3 5 tcp also followed a two stage mixed order kinetics it followed a pseudo zero order kinetics within 0 40 min of reaction and then followed a pseudo first order kinetics in 40 90 min the rate constant at 288 298 308 and 318 k were 1 7287 1 8239 1 9307 and 2 1821 mg l 1 min 1 within 0 40 min and 0 0629 0 0943 0 1372 and 0 1843 min 1 in 40 90 min as can be seen from fig 13 the reaction rate constant increased in both stages when the reaction temperature increased from 288 to 318 k indicting that the degradation of 3 5 dcp and 2 3 5 tcp on pd rgo nafion ti electrode were endothermic reaction the electrochemical dechlorination of 3 5 dcp and 2 3 5 tcp on pd rgo nafion ti electrode were controlled by current and solution diffusion successively dechlorination current was the rate controlling step in the initial stages of reaction the amount of chlorophenol was sufficient and the diffusion rate of chlorophenol from solution to the pd rgo nafion ti electrode surface surpassed the degradation rate of chlorophenol with the gradual degradation of chlorophenol in the latter stages diffusion became the rate controlling step 34 3 3 5 stability of the electrode the stability of the prepared pd rgo nafion ti electrode was investigated via repeating degradation of 3 5 dcp and 2 3 5 tcp 10 times under the same conditions table 1 shows the conversion efficiencies of 3 5 dcp and 2 3 5 tcp during the 10 times dechlorination as observed the conversion efficiencies of 3 5 dcp remained 100 throughout ten times consecutive degradation runs meanwhile the conversion efficiencies of 2 3 5 tcp were maintained at 99 5 during the 10 times dechlorination pd rgo nafion ti electrode exhibited favorable stability due to the strong binding capacity between pd particles and rgo nafion ti supporting electrode via electrochemical deposition 4 conclusions in this work a pd rgo nafion ti electrode was prepared and applied to the dechlorination of 3 5 dcp and 2 3 5 tcp the presence of rgo nafion middle layer increased the specific surface area and catalytic performance the hydrogen adsorption peak current of pd rgo nafion ti electrode was 181 2 ma complete conversion of 3 5 dcp and 2 3 5 tcp could be achieved within 90 min under initial ph of 2 3 and current of 5 ma the dechlorination intermediate products of 3 5 dcp was 3 cp the dechlorination intermediate products of 2 3 5 tcp were 2 3 dcp 2 5 dcp and 2 cp the final dechlorination product of 3 5 dcp and 2 3 5 tcp was mainly phenol dechlorination of 3 5 dcp and 2 3 5 tcp on pd rgo nafion ti electrode followed a two stage mixed order kinetics the pd rgo nafion ti electrode exhibited good stability and provided a new way

surface oxides in 0 1 mol l 1 boiled oxalic acid solution for 30 min in sequence the pretreated ti mesh was rinsed with di water and stored in ethanol rgo nafion suspension was obtained via dispersing rgo in 0 1 wt nafion ethanol solution the suspension was then sonicated for 30 min to ensure that it was homogeneous a dip coating method was used to loaded rgo on the pretreated ti mesh the pretreated ti mesh was used as substrate for dipping into the suspension for 15 s withdrawn at a speed of 1 cm s 1 and then dried completely under ambient condition after several repeated cycles the rgo nafion ti supporting electrode was obtained then the rgo nafion ti supporting electrode was used as cathode and a pt foil was used as anode for pd particles deposition under a constant current to prepare pd rgo nafion ti electrode the plating solution was pdcl2 solution containing surfactant ctab 20 mol l 1 for comparison a pd ti electrode was synthesized by electro deposition of pd particles on ti mesh under the same preparation conditions without modified with rgo nafion middle layer 2 3 dechlorination experiments electrochemical degradation of 3 5 dcp and 2 3 5 tcp was carried out at a

chromatograph ic metrohm switzerland with a metrohm metrosep a supp 5 150 4 0 anion separation column was used for analyzing the chlorine ion content in catholyte the conversion efficiency and current efficiency for dechlorination of 3 5 dcp and 2 3 5 tcp were calculated by the equations as described in articles 34 3 results and discussion 3 1 cyclic voltammetry analysis rgo nafion layer was covered on the ti mesh surface to prepare rgo nafion ti supporting electrode via dip coating method the effects of rgo concentration in suspension and repeat times of dip coating on the dip coating of rgo nafion layer were analyzed by electrochemical workstation and the cv test results are shown in fig 1 the effect of rgo content in suspension was investigated under repetitions of three fig 1 a shows cv curves of pure ti mesh and rgo nafion ti supporting electrode prepared at different rgo concentrations 0 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 and 1 0 g l 1 as the figure shows the hydrogen adsorption peak current of rgo nafion ti supporting electrodes at about 650 mv were larger than that of pure ti mesh indicating that rgo nafion layer can improve the hydrogen adsorption ability of the electrode the hydrogen adsorption peak current of rgo nafion ti supporting electrode reached maximum when the rgo concentration was 0 8 g l 1 the excessive rgo decreased the stability of rgo nafion layer on the surface of ti mesh or even fell off from ti mesh therefore rgo concentration of 0 8 g l 1 was selected for the preparation of rgo nafion ti supporting electrode the effect of repeat times of dip coating was then studied under rgo concentration of 0 8 g l 1 fig 1 b shows cv curves of rgo nafion ti supporting electrode prepared at different repeat times of dip coating 1 3 5 7 and 9 as can be seen from the figure the hydrogen adsorption peak current reached maximum at 7 times of dip coating the rgo nafion layer was too thick when dip coating was more than 7 times which resulted in the decrease of stability and specific surface area of supporting electrode thus 7 times of dip coating were selected as the optimal times of dip coating for the rgo nafion ti supporting electrode preparation in summary rgo concentration of 0 8 g l 1 and 7 times of dip coating were selected as the dip coating conditions for coating the rgo nafion layer on the surface of ti mesh subsequently pd rgo nafion ti electrode was synthesized via electro depositing pd particles on rgo nafion ti supporting electrode the effects of pd2 concentration ph of pdcl2 solution and electro deposition current and time on electro deposition were analyzed by cv and the cv test results are shown in fig 2 under an electro deposition current of 20 ma a pdcl2 solution ph of 0 3 and an electro deposition time of 30 min the effect of pd2 concentration was investigated cv curves of pd rgo nafion ti electrode prepared at different pd2 concentrations 2 5 7 10 and 15 mmol l 1 are shown in fig 2 a when the pd2 concentration increased from 2 to 5 mmol l 1 the hydrogen adsorption peak current reached 70 2 ma with further increase of the pd2 concentration to 7 10 or 15 mmol l 1 hydrogen adsorption peak currents were lower than that of 5 mmol l 1 therefore 5 mmol l 1 was chosen as the pd2 concentration for pd particles electro deposition under the selected pd2 concentration of 5 mmol l 1 the effect of the pdcl2 solution ph was analyzed at an electro deposition current of 20 ma and time of 30 min cv curves of pd rgo nafion ti electrode under different ph 0 1 0 3 0 5 0 7 and 1 1 are shown in fig 2 b it can be seen that the ph had less effect on the hydrogen adsorption capacity of electrode and the maximal hydrogen adsorption peak current of 70 4 ma was obtained with the pdcl2 solution ph of 0 3 therefore ph of 0 3 was selected as the optimum parameter for the pd particles load and subsequent experiments the effect of electro deposition current was investigated at a pd2 concentration of 5 mmol l 1 pdcl2 solution ph of 0 3 and electro deposition time of 30 min the cv curves of pd rgo nafion ti electrode at different electro deposition currents 20 30 40 50 and 60 ma are shown in fig 2 c the maximal hydrogen adsorption peak current of 127 0 ma was achieved at electro deposition current of 50 ma under higher electro deposition current than 50 ma electrode became unstable due to the formation of oversized pd particles on the surface and pd particles fell off from the electrode surface easily conversely under lower electro deposition current the loading amounts of pd particles was insufficient and the hydrogen adsorption peak current of electrode reduced finally the effect of electro deposition time was investigated under pd2 concentration of 5 mmol l 1 pdcl2 solution ph of 0 3 and electro deposition current of 50 ma fig 2 d shows cv curves of pd rgo nafion ti electrode prepared at different electro deposition time 15 30 45 60 and 75 min the hydrogen adsorption peak current of pd rgo nafion ti electrode increased with the electro deposition time increased from 15 to 60 min and then decreased when the electro deposition time reached 75 min at the longer time for pd particles electro deposition pd particles agglomerated and formed over thick pd layer on the surface resulting decrease of stability and specific surface area of electrode at the shorter electro deposition time the insufficient pd particles on electrode surface reduced hydrogen adsorption capacity of electrode to summarize the optimum electro deposition conditions of pd particles were achieved i e pd2 concentration of 5 mmol l 1 ph of 0 3 electro deposition current of 50 ma and time of 60 min under these conditions the hydrogen adsorption peak current of pd rgo nafion ti electrode was 181 2 ma compared to the pd cnts nafion film ti electrode prepared in our previous study the hydrogen adsorption peak current increased by 7 9 ma 34 it indicated that graphene can increase the hydrogen adsorption performance of the electrode more than carbon nanotubes fig 3 shows the cv curves of pd ti electrode and pd rgo nafion ti electrode after coating with rgo nafion middle layer the hydrogen adsorption peak current of pd rgo nafion ti electrode was 53 6 ma larger than that of pd ti electrode 127 6 ma results indicated that the presence of rgo nafion layer improved the hydrogen adsorption capacity of electrode and the catalytic activity of pd particles owing to the unique properties of rgo and nafion 47 3 2 characterization of electrodes the surface morphologies of ti mesh rgo nafion ti supporting electrode and pd rgo nafion ti electrode were studied by sem fig 4 a shows that pretreated ti mesh exhibited rough surface might which was beneficial to load rgo fig 4 b shows that rgo covered on the ti mesh surface uniformly improving the specific surface area of electrode and providing more attachment sites for loading of pd particles fig 4 c and d show the surface morphologies of pd rgo nafion ti electrode at different magnifications a great deal of pd particles protuberances were deposited on the surface of electrode uniformly fig 4 c as can be seen from fig 4 d the pd particles had accumulational flake like structures which improved specific surface areas and provided more catalytic active sites for dechlorination through the analysis of icp aes the pd content of pd rgo nafion ti electrode was 3 85 mg cm 2 fig 5 shows the xrd pattern of pd rgo nafion ti electrode prepared under optimal conditions the diffraction peaks at 2θ values of 40 2 46 8 68 2 82 2 and 86 7 are indexed to the 111 200 220 311 and 222 planes of pd jcpds 46 1043 pd0 particles exhibited face centered cubic fcc crystal structure on the surface of electrode the size of the pd crystallites was 14 0 nm by calculating using the scherrer formula 48 the chemical composition of pd rgo nafion ti electrode was examined by xps measurements the xps spectra of survey for electrode and pd 3d are shown in fig 6 the peaks of o 1 s pd 3d and c 1 s were observed in the electrode from xps survey spectrum fig 6 a indicating that pd was electrodeposited on the electrode surface successfully fig 6 b shows the pd 3d spectrum the significant peaks at 340 4 ev i and 335 1 ev ii are corresponding to the characteristic binding energy be values of pd0 3d3 2 and pd0 3d5 2 respectively 49 the small peaks located at higher binding energy be values of 341 9 ev iii and 336 7 ev iv are corresponding to pd2 3d3 2 and pd2 3d5 2 respectively the relative content of pd0 for pd rgo nafion ti electrode was higher than that of pd2 remarkably indicating that metallic pd0 was the dominant component at the electrode surface rather than oxides 3 3 electrocatalytic dechlorination the pd rgo nafion ti electrode prepared under the optimal conditions was used as cathode to degrade 3 5 dcp and 2 3 5 tcp under constant current respectively the effects of dechlorination current and initial ph were investigated in 100 mg l 1 chlorophenol solution 3 3 1 effect of dechlorination current the effects of dechlorination current on the conversion efficiency and the current efficiency of 3 5 dcp dechlorination were conducted at varying currents 2 5 8 and 10 ma with the catholyte ph of 4 3 and the results are shown in as observed from fig 7 a the 3 5 dcp conversion efficiency was only 11 7 after dechlorination for 90 min under the dechlorination current of 2 ma which due to the insufficient of hads amounts at a lower dechlorination current the 3 5 dcp conversion efficiency reached 76 5 at a current of 5 ma while the conversion efficiencies decreased to 60 5 and 39 0 at higher currents of 8 ma and 10 ma respectively this phenomenon was attributed to the inhibitory effect of her under the higher current under an excessively high current the generation rate of h2 from hads was greater than the dechlorination rate of 3 5 dcp with hads causing that the catalytic active sites on the electrode surface were covered by h2 and the amount of hads required for the dechlorination was insufficient fig 7 b shows the trend of changes in the current efficiency under different dechlorination currents as observed the current efficiency of the 3 5 dcp dechlorination conducted at 2 ma increased gradually at dechlorination currents of 5 ma and 8 ma the current efficiencies during the degradation increased rapidly first and then decreased the current efficiency of the 3 5 dcp dechlorination conducted at 10 ma decreased gradually during whole process after 90 min of reaction the dechlorination current efficiency increased gradually with the dechlorination current increased to 5 ma and then decreased as the dechlorination currents continued to increase to 8 ma and 10 ma the maximum current efficiency of 18 5 was achieved at the dechlorination current of 5 ma therefore current of 5 ma was elected for dechlorination and subsequent studies similarly the effects of dechlorination current on the conversion efficiency and current efficiency of 2 3 5 tcp dechlorination were also investigated at varying currents 3 5 7 and 9 ma with the catholyte ph of 5 7 the results are shown in fig 8 the maximum conversion efficiency of 42 5 and current efficiency of 9 7 were reached under the dechlorination current of 5 ma a current of 5 ma was selected through the optimization of reaction conditions 3 3 2 effect of initial ph under the current of 5 ma the dechlorination of 3 5 dcp was examined under different initial ph values of reaction solution 1 3 2 3 4 3 5 3 and 9 3 as can be seen from fig 9 a after reaction for 90 min the conversion efficiencies of 3 5 dcp could reach to 100 under initial ph of 1 3 and 2 3 however the conversion efficiencies decreased remarkably when the initial ph increased to 4 3 and 5 3 furthermore only 36 0 of 3 5 dcp was converted when the catholyte solution initial ph was alkaline ph 9 3 this result indicated that the lower ph was beneficial for 3 5 dcp dechlorination owing to the high yield of hads at a lower ph which could enhance the ech process 50 fig 9 b shows the trend of changes in current efficiencies during the dechlorination reaction under different initial ph as observed the current efficiencies increased during the initial period of the reaction and then gradually decreased after 90 min the current efficiency of 3 5 dcp dechlorination increased when the initial ph increased from 1 3 to 2 3 and then decreased as initial ph continued to rise the current efficiency reached maximum value 23 6 at initial ph of 2 3 after 90 min taking into account the results of conversion efficiency and current efficiency initial ph of 2 3 was selected for 3 5 dcp electrocatalytic dechlorination similarly the effects of initial ph on the dechlorination of 2 3 5 tcp were also investigated at varying initial ph 1 6 2 3 3 4 5 7 and 9 7 with the current of 5 ma and the results are shown in fig 10 a ph of 2 3 was selected as the initial ph through the optimization of reaction conditions at this initial ph value the conversion efficiency and current efficiency of 2 3 5 tcp after 90 min reached 100 and 26 1 respectively under the current of 5 ma and the initial ph of 2 3 3 5 dcp and 2 3 5 tcp dechlorination were carried out on ti mesh rgo nafion ti and pd ti electrode to investigate the effect of rgo nafion layer on dechlorination the conversion efficiencies of 3 5 dcp and 2 3 5 tcp on ti mesh were only 26 8 and 15 4 respectively see fig s1 in supplementary material after being modified with rgo nafion middle layer the conversion efficiencies of 3 5 dcp and 2 3 5 tcp on rgo nafion ti electrode increased to 34 6 and 24 8 respectively the conversion efficiencies of 3 5 dcp and 2 3 5 tcp on pd ti electrode reached 96 3 and 92 1 after 90 min respectively which were lower than that on pd rgo nafion ti electrode the results show that rgo nafion layer can improve the electrocatalytic activity of electrode comparison of the electrocatalytic performance on chlorophenol electrochemical reduction to that of other electrodes from other literatures was summarized in table 2 it showed that the pd rgo nafion ti electrode had higher competitive and promising on dechlorination of chlorophenol 3 3 3 dechlorination products of 3 5 dcp and 2 3 5 tcp the concentration of dechlorination intermediates and products were determined by hplc fig 11 a shows the contents of 3 5 dcp and products within 90 min of 3 5 dcp electrolysis on pd rgo nafion ti electrode under the selected dechlorination conditions current of 5 ma and initial ph of 2 3 the concentration of 3 5 dcp decreased rapidly within 0 40 min and then decreased gently within 40 90 min until complete degradation the concentration of dechlorination intermediates 3 chlorophenol 3 cp increased to 4 2 mg l 1 at the reaction time of 20 min followed by a decline after 70 min of reaction 3 cp was completely decomposed the concentration of phenol increased gradually within 0 60 min and reached 56 1 mg l 1 and then decreased slowly after 60 min indicating that phenol could be further decomposed 56 the amounts of 2 3 5 tcp and dechlorination products during the 2 3 5 tcp dechlorination process on pd rgo nafion ti electrode under the selected dechlorination conditions at room temperature are shown in fig 11 b as the reaction progresses the concentration of 2 3 5 tcp continued to decrease and could be converted completely after 90 min in the initial 30 min of the reaction the concentration of 2 3 dichlorophenol 2 3 dcp increased gradually and the concentration decreased subsequently at 30 80 min the change in 2 5 dichlorophenol 2 5 dcp concentration also has a similar trend the concentration increased within the initial 40 min and decreased gradually within 40 80 min after 80 min of reaction 2 3 dcp and 2 5 dcp were decomposed completely due to the effect of intramolecular hydrogen bonding and steric interaction on the aromatic ring of 2 3 5 tcp the chlorine atom at ortho position is substituted harder than that at meta position 57 which resulted in that 3 5 dichlorophenol 3 5 dcp was not generated during the ech process with the reaction going 2 chlorophenol 2 cp was detected after 20 min of dechlorination which indicated that the chlorine atoms on the dichlorophenols could be further removed the concentration of phenol rose to a maximum at 40 min of reaction and then gradually decreased until it was completely degraded at 90 min the content of phenol increased during the initial 80 min and decreased slowly after 80 min the ratios of chlorinated phenolic intermediates and phenol at different reaction times are showed in table s1 and s2 see in supplementary material the cl concentrations of 3 5 dcp and 2 3 5 tcp dechlorination were determined by ic as the reaction progressed the cl concentrations rose to 42 5 3 5 dcp dechlorination and 53 7 mg l 1 2 3 5 tcp dechlorination respectively fig 12 a and b solid curve the measured values were consistent with the theoretical values of cl generated upon complete dechlorination fig 12 a and b dashed line indicating that chlorine atoms on the chlorophenol molecules could be completely removed at 90 min 3 3 4 the kinetics of dechlorination the kinetics of electrocatalytic dechlorination of 3 5 dcp and 2 3 5 tcp were carried out at varying temperatures 288 298 308 and 318 k under the optimal reaction conditions i e current of 5 ma and initial ph of 2 3 fig 13 a and b show the different kinetic fitting curves of 3 5 dcp as can be seen from fig 13 a there is a good linear relationship between 3 5 dcp concentration ct and reaction time at the initial reaction time 0 30 min however a good linear relationship exists between ln ct and the reaction time within 30 90 min fig 13 b therefore it could be inferred that electrocatalytic dechlorination of 3 5 dcp on pd rgo nafion ti electrode followed a pseudo zero order kinetics at the beginning of the reaction and followed a pseudo first order kinetics at the later stage of the reaction the rate constant at 288 298 308 and 318 k were 2 5111 2 8025 3 1795 and 3 2026 mg l 1 min 1 within 0 30 min and 0 0706 0 1035 0 1782 and 0 1918 min 1 in 30 90 min fig 13 c and d show the reaction kinetic fitting curves of 2 3 5 tcp dechlorination at different time periods similarly the dechlorination process of 2 3 5 tcp also followed a two stage mixed order kinetics it followed a pseudo zero order kinetics within 0 40 min of reaction and then followed a pseudo first order kinetics in 40 90 min the rate constant at 288 298 308 and 318 k were 1 7287 1 8239 1 9307 and 2 1821 mg l 1 min 1 within 0 40 min and 0 0629 0 0943 0 1372 and 0 1843 min 1 in 40 90 min as can be seen from fig 13 the reaction rate constant increased in both stages when the reaction temperature increased from 288 to 318 k indicting that the degradation of 3 5 dcp and 2 3 5 tcp on pd rgo nafion ti electrode were endothermic reaction the electrochemical dechlorination of 3 5 dcp and 2 3 5 tcp on pd rgo nafion ti electrode were controlled by current and solution diffusion successively dechlorination current was the rate controlling step in the initial stages of reaction the amount of chlorophenol was sufficient and the diffusion rate of chlorophenol from solution to the pd rgo nafion ti electrode surface surpassed the degradation rate of chlorophenol with the gradual degradation of chlorophenol in the latter stages diffusion became the rate controlling step 34 3 3 5 stability of the electrode the stability of the prepared pd rgo nafion ti electrode was investigated via repeating degradation of 3 5 dcp and 2 3 5 tcp 10 times under the same conditions table 1 shows the conversion efficiencies of 3 5 dcp and 2 3 5 tcp during the 10 times dechlorination as observed the conversion efficiencies of 3 5 dcp remained 100 throughout ten times consecutive degradation runs meanwhile the conversion efficiencies of 2 3 5 tcp were maintained at 99 5 during the 10 times dechlorination pd rgo nafion ti electrode exhibited favorable stability due to the strong binding capacity between pd particles and rgo nafion ti supporting electrode via electrochemical deposition 4 conclusions in this work a pd rgo nafion ti electrode was prepared and applied to the dechlorination of 3 5 dcp and 2 3 5 tcp the presence of rgo nafion middle layer increased the specific surface area and catalytic performance the hydrogen adsorption peak current of pd rgo nafion ti electrode was 181 2 ma complete conversion of 3 5 dcp and 2 3 5 tcp could be achieved within 90 min under initial ph of 2 3 and current of 5 ma the dechlorination intermediate products of 3 5 dcp was 3 cp the dechlorination intermediate products of 2 3 5 tcp were 2 3 dcp 2 5 dcp and 2 cp the final dechlorination product of 3 5 dcp and 2 3 5 tcp was mainly phenol dechlorination of 3 5 dcp and 2 3 5 tcp on pd rgo nafion ti electrode followed a two stage mixed order kinetics the pd rgo nafion ti electrode exhibited good stability and provided a new way

14481,cellulose offers a large renewable raw material base and can be chemically modified in a variety of ways to introduce new functionalities such as cationic charge that are required in effective waste water treatment for any polymers cationic cellulose derivatives were synthesized using both conventional and novel methods from several commercially available cellulose pulps the cationic derivatives were used as biobased flocculants to treat real life wastewater samples in a head to head comparison with cationic polyacrylamides a novel high consistency high shear mixing heterogeneous mixing method enables the preparation of cellulose derivatives without the use of solvent or high cost solubilization methods when higher cationic charge is required deep eutectic solvents can be used to modify cellulose both the molecular weight and charge of the cationic cellulose derivatives have a drastic influence on performance in water treatment applications flocculation experiments with real life waste water samples revealed that cationic cellulose derivatives are able to effectively function as flocculants and fixatives and even outperform commercial polyacrylamides the highest achieved level of turbidity removal was 93 2 cationic cellulose derivatives provided good efficacy in sludge dewatering focused beam reflectance measurement flocculation tests and anionic trash fixing which are crucial properties for the pulp and paper industry keywords cationic cellulose flocculants wastewater treatment 1 introduction the increasing demand for the use of sustainable materials in industrial applications has created a need to develop technologies that enable the use of biopolymers such as cellulose for the replacement of petroleum based chemicals effective purification of wastewater is one of the most crucial questions of the future that demands a long term solution cellulose is one of the most abundant natural polymers and could be a primary chemical resource in the future due to its renewability biodegradability biocompatibility and extensive derivatisation capacity 1 the strong intra and intermolecular hydrogen bonds in cellulose create difficulties when cellulose needs to be processed using industrially applicable methods and strong chemical or enzymatic modification of cellulose is needed to enforce its compatibility especially with petroleum derived components 2 cationisation of cellulose has been found to have significant industrial importance from several areas including the paper cosmetics textiles food packaging and water purification industries 3 6 in the textile industry cationic cellulose is mainly used to remove acidic dyes from aqueous eluents and thus diminishing environmental stress of these processes 7 in the paper industry cellulose fibres are used to improve the mechanical properties of dispersions and composites to purify process water and to provide specific functionalities for paper products 8 the use of cationic cellulose to purify waste waters from various sources has also been suggested 8 11 cellulose fibres naturally contain o and coo groups resulting from the deprotonation of small amounts of carboxylic acid and alcohol groups and are thus negatively charged cellulose repels anionic dyes as well as anionic filler particles in dispersions unless it is chemically modified and cationisation is generally used to modify cellulose to enable its use in these applications colloids in water are also usually negatively charged and a high content of cationic groups in the cellulose derivatives is needed to reach high flocculation capacity flocculation is an effective and economical way of purifying wastewater common industrial scale flocculants used for this purpose are polyacrylamides or amines typically copolymers of acrylamide and sodium acrylate cationic polyacrylamides have traditionally been used for these purposes due to their relatively low price 12 however with industrial development the amount of wastewater has increased significantly and the demand for effective cheap and environmentally friendly flocculants for the treatment of various kinds of wastewater is becoming increasingly high cellulose could provide a long term solution for this dilemma if industrially applicable methods can be used for its cationisation cationic cellulose has been reportedly to be prepared both using heterogeneous 3 9 13 14 and homogeneous 7 8 10 9 11 reaction methods utilizing various cationisation reagents yet using glycidyl trimethylammonium chloride gtac or eptmac has been the prevalent choice 8 10 13 18 such cationisation systems have also been reportedly for cationic xylan 19 23 and well documented for preparing cationic starch 24 26 however high cationic charge has only been acquired using homogeneous modification methods which have demanded the use of expensive and toxic solvents such as dimethylacetamide that are incapable of competing with the manufacturing price of cationic polyacrylamides furthermore there is only a limited number of reports available on the flocculation performance of such cationic cellulose derivatives with real life wastewater samples and these have not involved head to head comparison with commercial polyacrylamides which are considered as the golden standard of wastewater treatment 8 27 the aim of this work was to evaluate different methods to prepare cationic cellulose derivatives and compare their performance properties in different flocculation tests against commercial flocculants the potential of the cationic cellulose derivatives as flocculants was evaluated using standard industrial flocculation tests with three different types of real life wastewater samples the performance of the cationic cellulose derivatives was compared to that of synthetic cationic polymers currently used for this purpose the influence of the properties of cellulose were also studied and the suitability of different cellulose pulps were compared for this particular purpose part of the discussion and interpretation of the results presented in this paper are based on the raw data originally published in the public fubio biorefinery program report which has limited availability in the future biorefinery program cationic cellulose derivatives were prepared using heterogeneous and homogeneous modification methods to compare the different methods and to study the effect of charge and other polymer properties on the flocculation performance 9 in addition cationic cellulose derivatives were synthesized using a novel method based in the use of deep eutectic solvents 2 materials and methods the cellulose materials in this study were commercially available dissolving pulp sheets produced by domsjö fabriker mw 570 000 kda and borregaard chemcell mw 1700 000 kda never dried hemi poor softwood kraft cellulose mn 880 000 kda was also used as a starting material the kraft cellulose was provided by metsä group oy grade rma90 bleached to 90 iso brightness highest grade glycidyl trimethyl ammonium chloride and choline chloride were purchased from sigma aldrich and were dried under vacuum over night at 40 c and applied immediately after vacuum fennopol k3400r and fennopol k506 are ordinary flocculant grade polyacrylamides thus their molecular weights are considered to be several million g mol because no accurate methods exist for measuring polyacrylamide molecular weight their size is commonly characterized by using standard viscosity sv which is measured from a 0 1 solution prepared with 1 m nacl with a brookfield viscometer at 25 c standard viscosity is 3 0 for fennopol k3400r and 3 8 for fennopol k506 2 1 cationisation of cellulose pulps using conventional methods cationisation of cellulose was conducted in heterogeneous form using a similar type of method to that reported by bendoraitiene et al 26 for starch by mixing cellulose with catalytic amounts of sodium hydroxide solubilised in water and glycidyl trimethyl ammonium chloride gtac and stirring the mixture using either a standard mechanical laboratory stirrer or a high viscosity cv helicone mix flow design integrated technology usa inc high consistency high shear mixing reactor followed by washing and dialysis with water and ethanol for some samples the cellulose was mercerised similarly to that described in the literature 28 29 before the cationisation reaction homogeneous cationization reactions of cellulose were conducted using a the method presented by ott et al 10 in which cellulose was first solubilised via solvent exchange to dimethylacetamide 5 lithium chloride dmac licl solution and then mixed with gtac and naoh solubilised in water and the mixture was stirred overnight at the chosen temperature using a standard mechanical laboratory stirrer the exact parameters for each sample have been presented in detail in the report 9 the degree of substitution ds of the cationic cellulose derivatives was determined based on the nitrogen content of the samples by the kjehldahl method 26 and in some cases also additionally using 13c cp mas or 13c liquid state spectroscopy the reaction mechanism for the cationization reactions is shown in fig 1 2 2 cationisation of cellulose pulps using a deep eutectic solvent des mixture cationisation of cellulose was carried out by our previously reported method utilizing a 1 3 mixture of boric acid and glycidyl trimethyl ammonium chloride 18 in a typical procedure cellulose 5 0 g in dry weight 70 dry matter content was mixed in 100 g of the des solution at 40 c after two hours of mixing 0 16 g of sodium hydroxide powder was added to the mixture and stirring continued for 22 h at a constant temperature under vacuum to remove water the suspension was washed with water filtered and finally dialysed with water and ethanol 2 3 application testing of cationic cellulose charge density of the samples was measured by titrating the sample at ph 7 5 using a mütek pcd 03 particle charge detector with 0 001 n sodium polyethylene sulphonate as the titrant all measurements were repeated five times and reported as the average value of these five measurements maximum standard error of the method is 0 01 meq g charge density is considered as the most trustable method to determine cationic charge of cellulose derivatives because it eliminates the effect of impurities and side reactions which might influence methods focused in determining the total nitrogen content of the samples salt viscosity was measured using a brookfield dv i viscosimeter a solution for the measurements was made by preparing a 2 solution of the sample and adding sodium chloride five times the amount of the sample into the solution the measurement was made at 25 c using a small sample adapter and spindle 18 or 31 depending on the viscosity level capillary suction time cst is a standardised method to evaluate the time of water draining from the sludge into a standard piece of board characterising the ability of the sludge to dewater the testing equipment triton cst and standard boards were manufactured by triton time is measured by ring electrodes which follow the spread of the water front in the piece of board cst informs how quickly the free water in the sludge is able to penetrate into the piece of board at different dosing levels of the studied samples 2 20 kg of dry material tonne of dry sludge tests were carried out using digested sludge from suomenoja municipal wastewater treatment plant espoo finland the ph of the sludge was 7 0 7 5 maximum standard error 0 1 the dry solids content of the sludge varied from 2 21 to 2 68 blank dewatering times penetration without the sample varied from 305 to 232 s the amount of sludge was 100 g per measurement with a mixing time of 15 s at 1000 rpm the reference material in the cst tests was fennopol k506 kemira a commercial cationic polyacrylamide focused beam reflectance measurement fbrm is a laboratory procedure used to describe paper machine first pass retention fbrm tests were run using a lasentec d600 measuring device which analyses particle or floc mean size as a function of time after sample dosing the probe of the lasentec emits a laser beam when immersed into the investigated system when a solid particle transcribes the beam light is reflected back to the probe fbrm is a dynamic measurement for flocculation and floc strength under shearing of the system dry matter of the furnish used in this test furnish dry content 5 0 g

water see https www hsy fi en experts water services drinking water quality pages default aspx for specific properties was used in furnish preparation and ph was adjusted to 7 5 with acetic acid at each test point the furnish amount was 500 g and mixing speed was 1500 rpm sample dosing amounts were 2 16 kg of dry material tonne of dry furnish after dosing the sample into the furnish data for floc size was collected for two minutes the reference material used in the fbrm tests was fennopol k3400r kemira a commercial cationic polyacrylamide fixing tests were performed using industrial groundwood pulp gw at ph 6 9 gw pulp commonly requires a fixing chemical in the papermaking process a commercial polyamine for this purpose fennofix 50 kemira was used as a reference the samples were normally dosed at 0 2 concentration high mixing speed 1500 or 1000 rpm was used to induce high shear forces into the studied suspension high shear forces break the forming flocs and thus give a more realistic picture of the stability of the flocs compared to the actual systems in centrifuges or paper machines where commercial flocculants are commonly used statistical significance was calculated with spss software by analyzing data with two way analysis of variance including response and compound as explanatory variables as well as their interaction 3 results and discussion 3 1 preparation of cationic cellulose derivatives the cationisation of cellulose see fig 1 using the conventional heterogeneous reaction system proceeds conveniently but the system seems to have a limit for the maximum achievable ds of around 0 5 using standard mechanical laboratory stirrers stirring the mixture becomes difficult at around 10 consistency and the evenness of the substitution throughout the material can no longer be guaranteed this has also traditionally been the limiting factor when using other chemical modification methods for cellulose in the case of the derivatives reaching a ds of 0 5 no water solubility was observed lack of water solubility can be an indirect indication of inhomogeneous substitution and additionally limitations in the mixing ability of standard laboratory stirrers limiting the amount of water and determining the optimum amount of naoh seem to be the most crucial parameters similarly to that described by bendoraitiene et al 26 consequently a clear maximum ds for the reaction could be found regardless of how much gtac was used which is a direct result of inefficient mixing and excessive water in the reaction mixture reaching high cellulose consistencies while limiting the amount of water and still providing efficient and even mixing is not possible using standard laboratory stirrers since cellulose pulp always contains water and pulp hornification lowers reaction efficacy the presence of water cannot be avoided and the amount of water is in this case ultimately the ds limiting factor surprisingly higher degrees of substitution and water solubility were received using the heterogeneous modification method when a high consistency high shear mixing system was used for the reaction to our knowledge these types of reactors have not been extensively used for chemical modification of cellulose and their availability has been previously limited it has been however shown that shearing forces decrease the crystallinity of cellulose by breaking extensive inter chain and intra chain hydrogen bonds that make it difficult to dissolve cellulose in common solvents and thus enable better and more even penetration of chemicals into the cellulose fibre structure which results in more even substitution 30 the cv helicone mix flow reactor used in our study has an unique design as it has been specifically designed to improve processing of high molecular weight polymers such as cellulose for chemical and mechanical modification furthermore high shear mixing enables chemical modifications to be conducted in high consistency with high mixing power without interference caused by solvents such as in this case water in these syntheses the consistency of cellulose could be increased and thus the amount of water strictly limited without compromising efficient mixing the products prepared using this equipment formed stable white slightly transparent and viscous gels in water the aforementioned qualities were observed to some extent regardless of the degree of substitution unlike using a conventional laboratory stirrer which might be an indication of more even substitution even at lower ds levels this is due to an effective mixing efficiency than when using a standard mechanical laboratory stirrer and better reaction efficiency when the amount of water could additionally be limited differences between different cellulose pulps could also be seen never dried cellulose seems to have the highest reactivity when heterogeneous modification methods are used as was previously proposed 31 and as other authors have also suggested 32 this is largely due to the increased porosity of the structures when the effect of fibre hornification is minimised borregaard was observed to be less reactive than the domsjö cellulose but this is understandable because the molecular weight of borregaard is notably higher than the other cellulose pulps however for cationic polyacrylamides it has been shown that high molecular weight might be advantageous in terms of flocculation performance 12 and this was also expected for the cellulose derivatives in general the amount of residual water in the cellulose had the biggest influence on the reaction efficiency when the heterogeneous modification method was used the cationic cellulose derivatives prepared by solubilising the material in dmac licl mixture via solvent exchange 33 resulted in water soluble products already at a ds of 0 5 this clearly indicates a more homogeneous substitution understandably received using the homogeneous reaction system the aqueous solutions prepared from the cationic derivatives were completely transparent the original method 10 has low reaction efficacy but the reaction efficacy was largely improved by using water as a catalyst similarly as has been reported for heterogeneous reactions 26 31 and as was also used in the heterogeneous reactions presented in this paper however the dmac licl solubilization method has drawbacks as the cost of solubilizing in dmac licl combined with recycling and purification costs and the overall low cellulose consistency in this solvent make the total cost much higher than for cationic commercial polyacrylamides 9 it is however important to understand the full potential of cationic cellulose derivatives with the highest achievable degrees of substitution for which purpose the homogeneous dmac licl method was used additionally to the novel high shear heterogeneous mixing method the cationic cellulose derivatives prepared using the deep eutectic solvent method seem to have a somewhat similar degree of substitution of 1 2 1 1 and 0 6 respectively for domsjö never dried and borregaard pulps which are in the order of the molar weights of the pulps all pulps form slightly transparent gels in water but are not completely soluble the reaction consistency of 5 is not very high but the deep eutectic mixture can be concentrated and reused after the precipitation of cellulose and thus remains cost competitive in comparison with traditional methods when cellulose is solubilized the deep eutectic solvent mixture is relatively acidic and causes degradation of cellulose so high molecular weight cannot be either retained 18 3 2 characterisation of cationic cellulose derivatives ds has been traditionally used for evaluating the cationic charge of cellulose derivatives even if it does not take into account impurities or undesired side reactions the relationship between the ds acquired by the kjehldahl method and charge acquired by charge titration is presented in fig 2 the theoretical dependency between the ds and the corresponding charge is shown as a curve in bold the ds is calculated based on the total amount of nitrogen present in the samples and possible side reactions or impurities such as physically adsorbed reagents could possibly lead to an overestimation of the ds value therefore charge density was chosen as a better variable for evaluation of the flocculation performance and comparison of different cellulose derivatives because it takes into account only the influence of cationic nitrogen groups that are able to contribute to a charge 3 3 flocculation performance flocculants are generally used in many applications by the pulp and paper industry we chose three most commonly used flocculation tests to evaluate the performance of the cationic cellulose derivatives in comparison to the commercially available polyacrylamide and polyamine products which the plants currently use in sludge dewatering the dry matter content of the sludge is maximized in order to minimize the costs of transportation and in further treatment of the sludge such as in composting or in incineration in paper machine retention the idea is to flocculate the mineral filler and fibre fine particles and thus improve their retention inside a formed web structure fbrm flocculation tests have good correlation with the actual retention efficiency in real life paper machines and are thus commonly used in evaluation of flocculant chemicals idea of anionic trash fixing is to fix disturbing substances from paper stock or pulp water onto the fibre surface and thus make the process water cleaner it is believed that pitch particles originating from wood cause problems in the papermaking process by inducing deposits and thus breaks in the paper web 9 11 23 fixing of the pitch particles onto surfaces of the cellulose fibres by using cationic polymers reduces this risk significantly the principle of the fixing test is based on the fact that if there is free pitch dispersed in water the water becomes turbid the addition of a cationic polymer fixes the pitch onto the paper fibre surface and the turbidity in the water phase decreases less disturbing substances in the paper stock water improve runnability of paper machines by decreasing the number of unwanted breaks during production 3 3 1 sludge dewatering samples for sludge dewateringtest were chosen by selecting derivatives with the highest charge prepared from each of the cellulose materials samples prepared both by the high consistency heterogeneous and homogeneous methods were chosen for comparison the performance of the selected samples is presented in fig 3 where the cst the capillary suction time is plotted against the amount of the polymer used described as dosing and expressed as kilograms per sludge dry ton the efficiency is at its best when a small dosing amount gives a low cst value it is seen that the samples made in the homogeneous dmac licl solution or the des suspension perform better than those made in the heterogeneous high consistency reaction system a major factor behind this difference is the higher charge of the samples prepared in a homogeneous solution or des suspension the homogeneity of the samples prepared in a homogeneous solution is presumably higher which is also reflected in their application performance the molecular weight of the derivatives does not seem to influence their performance notably and charge is ultimately the main factor affecting their efficiency the charge is plotted against dewatering performance in fig 4 despite the fact that the cationic charge of the cationic polyacrylamide is much higher the performance of the best cellulose derivatives is almost similar to that of the cationic polyacrylamide 3 3 2 fbrm flocculation tests the dynamic mean floc sizes acquired for samples selected by a similar principle as in the previous application are presented in fig 5 all the cationic cellulose samples clearly produce a smaller floc size than the reference polyacrylamide this is understandable because the molecular weight of the polyacrylamide reference is typically several or even tens of millions of g mol whereas cellulose is at its highest in the region of one or two million g mol however although the floc size with the cationic cellulose samples is smaller the flocs seem to be very resistant to shearing forces in fact after a longer mixing time an experiment with a stronger than usual shearing environment showed that the cationic cellulose samples gave an even bigger residual floc size than the reference polyacrylamide when comparing the different cellulose pulps the never dried pulp reached the highest values in comparison to the other cellulose pulps regardless of the modification method interestingly the never dried cationic cellulose derivative produced using the high consistency heterogeneous modification method reached higher values than all the derivatives prepared using the homogeneous modification method the mean floc sizes as a function of dosing received using the different cationic cellulose derivatives are presented in fig 6 in most cases a clear response for increasing the amount of dosing was seen and the floc size increased by adding a larger amount of the cationic cellulose derivatives the highest maximum floc sizes were achieved with a dosing of 12 kg t and was the highest for entry 15 never dried cellulose modified using the high consistency method statistical significance for the difference in maximum floc size for the two samples prepared from never dried cellulose entries 15 and 26 using either the high consistency heterogeneous method or homogenous method was p 0 01 to further evaluate the flocculation performance of individual cellulose derivatives the relationship between the maximum mean floc size and salt viscosity was compared as shown in fig 7 higher salt viscosity is an indication of higher molecular weight and higher molecular weight seems to give a larger mean floc size and thus more efficient flocculation performance clearly the largest flocs are achieved with the never dried charge 2 2 meq g maximum floc size 19 5 μm and domsjö pulp charge 2 3 meq g maximum floc size 19 2 μm derivatives that were prepared using the heterogeneous high consistency method when cellulose is dissolved in dmac licl the material loses its fibrillar nature subsequent cationization in dmac licl can also reduce the molecular weight of cellulose 8 and it is known that modification of cellulose in the des mixture also lowers molecular weight 18 and is typically not capable of solubilizing cellulose completely 34 even if the substitution of cellulose might be more inhomogeneous when prepared using the heterogeneous high consistency method the samples retain their fibrillar nature and thus can provide more structural kinks and curves for the formation of larger flocs unlike in sludge dewatering tests high cationic charge does not seem to be a requirement in fbrm tests 3 3 3 anionic trash fixing fixing performance of the selected samples is shown in fig 8 where turbidity removal has been plotted against flocculant dose it could be seen that the main influencing parameter in fixing performance was clearly the charge density although that alone does not explain the whole ranking order in the fixing performance entry 18 gives an equal performance with the reference whereas entry 33 and entry 36 perform even better than the reference polyamine the main difference between the entries 33 and 36 and the rest of the derivatives is the molecular weight the lower molecular weight of the domsjö pulp seems to be advantageous for providing a better fixing result regardless of the carge thus methods that lower the molecular weight of cellulose are not necessarily disadvantageous if the derivatives are used as fixatives furthermore even the highest charge density cationic cellulose samples have a notably lower charge density than the reference polyamine the charge density of which is close to 7 meq g thus the cationic cellulose samples can perform better than the commercial polyamines currently used for this purpose even when their charge density is lower 4 conclusions the highest cationic charges were received by using either the homogeneous modification method or the deep eutectic solvent based method cost wise the homogeneous method is not capable of competing with the manufacturing costs of cationic polyacrylamides 9 whereas the deep eutectic solvent method provides a better alternative the difficulty of processing cellulose is perhaps the single most important contributor for the limitations in degrees of substitution achievable by heterogeneous methods traditional heterogeneous mixing methods are not able to provide similar levels of cationic charge as homogeneous methods and have severe limitations for this purpose utilizing high shear mixing can provide a new inexpensive way to modify cellulose heterogeneously because it enables better penetration of reagents into the cellulose structure enables the control of reaction efficacy limiting factors and reagents and produces cationic derivatives with a higher charge a comparison of different cellulose pulps showed that never dried cellulose has a slightly higher reactivity than dried pulps especially using the high consistency heterogeneous modification method and that the molecular weight of the pulps has an influence on the maximum charge received using these methods careful selection of the pulp is thus required for efficient chemical modification cationic cellulose derivatives were subjected to a series of evaluations for their suitability for use as industrial flocculants and fixatives sludge dewatering tests showed that cationic cellulose is able to function at a good level with a performance close to that of cationic polyacrylamide high cationic charge is crucial for the performance of cationic cellulose derivatives in sludge dewatering in fbrm flocculation tests cationic cellulose forms flocs even if their size is smaller than the ones received using cationic polyacrylamide remarkably the flocs received by using cationic cellulose maintained their size for a noticeably longer period under vigorous stirring than the ones received using cationic polyacrylamide furthermore the flocs received with cationic cellulose were able to resist higher shearing forces than the ones received with cationic polyacrylamide high cationic charge is not a requirement for the performance of the cellulose derivatives in fbrm tests cationic cellulose derivatives can also perform better in anionic trash fixing tests when compared with a commercial cationic polyamine a better performance has been perceived even with a notably lower charge when compared with the cationic polyamine lower molecular weight seems to be advantageous in anionic trash fixing for the cationic cellulose derivatives high cationic charge further improves the performance of cationic cellulose derivatives in fixing tests in summary it was shown that cationic cellulose derivatives perform well as flocculants and fixatives and thus provide a biodegradable environmentally friendly alternative for currently used synthetic cationic polymers wastewater treatment remains one of the key issues in the management of environmental resources in the future and there is a requirement of long term solutions which do not further stress the environment cellulose would be an optional material for the preparation of wastewater treatment chemicals due to its renewability naturally high molecular weight and high availability in various parts of the world the chemical modification methods previously used have suffered from many drawbacks such as high cost and requirement for special grade pulps high consistency mixing combined with utilizing industrial quality cellulose pulp could provide an economical modification method that does not involve the use of toxic solvents expensive cellulose grades or require solubilization of cellulose many of these difficulties are also neglected by using deep eutectic solvents for the modification similar risks in toxicity and lack of biodegradability as in the case of synthetic cationic polymers 35 39 are notably reduced when cellulose derivatives are used instead therefore the cationic cellulose derivatives seem to be highly applicable for use as waste water treatment chemicals acknowledgments the experimental data

14481,cellulose offers a large renewable raw material base and can be chemically modified in a variety of ways to introduce new functionalities such as cationic charge that are required in effective

which are crucial properties for the pulp and paper industry keywords cationic cellulose flocculants wastewater treatment 1 introduction the increasing demand for the use of sustainable materials in industrial applications has created a need to develop technologies that enable the use of biopolymers such as cellulose for the replacement of petroleum based chemicals effective purification of wastewater is one of the most crucial questions of the future that demands a long term solution cellulose is one of the most abundant natural polymers and could be a primary chemical resource in the future due to its renewability biodegradability biocompatibility and extensive derivatisation capacity 1 the strong intra and intermolecular hydrogen bonds in cellulose create difficulties when cellulose needs to be processed using industrially applicable methods and strong chemical or enzymatic modification of cellulose is needed to enforce its compatibility especially with petroleum derived components 2 cationisation of cellulose has been found to have significant industrial importance from several areas including the paper cosmetics textiles food packaging and water purification industries 3 6 in the textile industry cationic cellulose is mainly used to remove acidic dyes from aqueous eluents and thus diminishing environmental stress of these processes 7 in the paper industry cellulose fibres are used to improve the mechanical properties of dispersions and composites to purify process water and to provide specific functionalities for paper products 8 the use of cationic cellulose to purify waste waters from various sources has also been suggested 8 11 cellulose fibres naturally contain o and coo groups resulting from the deprotonation of small amounts of carboxylic acid and alcohol groups and are thus negatively charged cellulose repels anionic dyes as well as anionic filler particles in dispersions unless it is chemically modified and cationisation is generally used to modify cellulose to enable its use in these applications colloids in water are also usually negatively charged and a high content of cationic groups in the cellulose derivatives is needed to

different dosing levels of the studied samples 2 20 kg of dry material tonne of dry sludge tests were carried out using digested sludge from suomenoja municipal wastewater treatment plant espoo finland the ph of the sludge was 7 0 7 5 maximum standard error 0 1 the dry solids content of the sludge varied from 2 21 to 2 68 blank dewatering times penetration without the sample varied from 305 to 232 s the amount of sludge was 100 g per measurement with a mixing time of 15 s at 1000 rpm the reference material in the cst tests was fennopol k506 kemira a commercial cationic polyacrylamide focused beam reflectance measurement fbrm is a laboratory procedure used to describe paper machine first pass retention fbrm tests were run using a lasentec d600 measuring device which analyses particle or floc mean size as a function of time after sample dosing the probe of the lasentec emits a laser beam when immersed into the investigated system when a solid particle transcribes the beam light is reflected back to the probe fbrm is a dynamic measurement for flocculation and floc strength under shearing of the system dry matter of the furnish used in this test furnish dry content 5 0 g per kg consisted of 60 bleached mechanical groundwood pulp gw originating from two different paper mills and 40 of precipitated calcium carbonate filler pcc albacar 5970 from specialty minerals tap water see https www hsy fi en experts water services drinking water quality pages default aspx for specific properties was used in furnish preparation and ph was adjusted to 7 5 with acetic acid at each test point the furnish amount was 500 g and mixing speed was 1500 rpm sample dosing amounts were 2 16 kg of dry material tonne of dry furnish after dosing the sample into the furnish data for floc size was collected for two minutes the reference material used in the fbrm tests was fennopol k3400r kemira a commercial cationic polyacrylamide fixing tests were performed using industrial groundwood pulp gw at ph 6 9 gw pulp commonly requires a fixing chemical in the papermaking process a commercial polyamine for this purpose fennofix 50 kemira was used as a reference the samples were normally dosed at 0 2 concentration high mixing speed 1500 or 1000 rpm was used to induce high shear forces into the studied suspension high shear forces break the forming flocs and thus give a more realistic picture of the stability of the flocs compared to the actual systems in centrifuges or paper machines where commercial flocculants are commonly used statistical significance was calculated with spss software by analyzing data with two way analysis of variance including response and compound as explanatory variables as well as their interaction 3 results and discussion 3 1 preparation of cationic cellulose derivatives the cationisation of cellulose see fig 1 using the conventional heterogeneous reaction system proceeds conveniently but the system seems to have a limit for the maximum achievable ds of around 0 5 using standard mechanical laboratory stirrers stirring the mixture becomes difficult at around 10 consistency and the evenness of the substitution throughout the material can no longer be guaranteed this has also traditionally been the limiting factor when using other chemical modification methods for cellulose in the case of the derivatives reaching a ds of 0 5 no water solubility was observed lack of water solubility can be an indirect indication of inhomogeneous substitution and additionally limitations in the mixing ability of standard laboratory stirrers limiting the amount of water and determining the optimum amount of naoh seem to be the most crucial parameters similarly to that described by bendoraitiene et al 26 consequently a clear maximum ds for the reaction could be found regardless of how much gtac was used which is a direct result of inefficient mixing and excessive water in the reaction mixture reaching high cellulose consistencies while limiting the amount of water and still providing efficient and even mixing is not possible using standard laboratory stirrers since cellulose pulp always contains water and pulp hornification lowers reaction efficacy the presence of water cannot be avoided and the amount of water is in this case ultimately the ds limiting factor surprisingly higher degrees of substitution and water solubility were received using the heterogeneous modification method when a high consistency high shear mixing system was used for the reaction to our knowledge these types of reactors have not been extensively used for chemical modification of cellulose and their availability has been previously limited it has been however shown that shearing forces decrease the crystallinity of cellulose by breaking extensive inter chain and intra chain hydrogen bonds that make it difficult to dissolve cellulose in common solvents and thus enable better and more even penetration of chemicals into the cellulose fibre structure which results in more even substitution 30 the cv helicone mix flow reactor used in our study has an unique design as it has been specifically designed to improve processing of high molecular weight polymers such as cellulose for chemical and mechanical modification furthermore high shear mixing enables chemical modifications to be conducted in high consistency with high mixing power without interference caused by solvents such as in this case water in these syntheses the consistency of cellulose could be increased and thus the amount of water strictly limited without compromising efficient mixing the products prepared using this equipment formed stable white slightly transparent and viscous gels in water the aforementioned qualities were observed to some extent regardless of the degree of substitution unlike using a conventional laboratory stirrer which might be an indication of more even substitution even at lower ds levels this is due to an effective mixing efficiency than when using a standard mechanical laboratory stirrer and better reaction efficiency when the amount of water could additionally be limited differences between different cellulose pulps could also be seen never dried cellulose seems to have the highest reactivity when heterogeneous modification methods are used as was previously proposed 31 and as other authors have also suggested 32 this is largely due to the increased porosity of the structures when the effect of fibre hornification is minimised borregaard was observed to be less reactive than the domsjö cellulose but this is understandable because the molecular weight of borregaard is notably higher than the other cellulose pulps however for cationic polyacrylamides it has been shown that high molecular weight might be advantageous in terms of flocculation performance 12 and this was also expected for the cellulose derivatives in general the amount of residual water in the cellulose had the biggest influence on the reaction efficiency when the heterogeneous modification method was used the cationic cellulose derivatives prepared by solubilising the material in dmac licl mixture via solvent exchange 33 resulted in water soluble products already at a ds of 0 5 this clearly indicates a more homogeneous substitution understandably received using the homogeneous reaction system the aqueous solutions prepared from the cationic derivatives were completely transparent the original method 10 has low reaction efficacy but the reaction efficacy was largely improved by using water as a catalyst similarly as has been reported for heterogeneous reactions 26 31 and as was also used in the heterogeneous reactions presented in this paper however the dmac licl solubilization method has drawbacks as the cost of solubilizing in dmac licl combined with recycling and purification costs and the overall low cellulose consistency in this solvent make the total cost much higher than for cationic commercial polyacrylamides 9 it is however important to understand the full potential of cationic cellulose derivatives with the highest achievable degrees of substitution for which purpose the homogeneous dmac licl method was used additionally to the novel high shear heterogeneous mixing method the cationic cellulose derivatives prepared using the deep eutectic solvent method seem to have a somewhat similar degree of substitution of 1 2 1 1 and 0 6 respectively for domsjö never dried and borregaard pulps which are in the order of the molar weights of the pulps all pulps form slightly transparent gels in water but are not completely soluble the reaction consistency of 5 is not very high but the deep eutectic mixture can be concentrated and reused after the precipitation of cellulose and thus remains cost competitive in comparison with traditional methods when cellulose is solubilized the deep eutectic solvent mixture is relatively acidic and causes degradation of cellulose so high molecular weight cannot be either retained 18 3 2 characterisation of cationic cellulose derivatives ds has been traditionally used for evaluating the cationic charge of cellulose derivatives even if it does not take into account impurities or undesired side reactions the relationship between the ds acquired by the kjehldahl method and charge acquired by charge titration is presented in fig 2 the theoretical dependency between the ds and the corresponding charge is shown as a curve in bold the ds is calculated based on the total amount of nitrogen present in the samples and possible side reactions or impurities such as physically adsorbed reagents could possibly lead to an overestimation of the ds value therefore charge density was chosen as a better variable for evaluation of the flocculation performance and comparison of different cellulose derivatives because it takes into account only the influence of cationic nitrogen groups that are able to contribute to a charge 3 3 flocculation performance flocculants are generally used in many applications by the pulp and paper industry we chose three most commonly used flocculation tests to evaluate the performance of the cationic cellulose derivatives in comparison to the commercially available polyacrylamide and polyamine products which the plants currently use in sludge dewatering the dry matter content of the sludge is maximized in order to minimize the costs of transportation and in further treatment of the sludge such as in composting or in incineration in paper machine retention the idea is to flocculate the mineral filler and fibre fine particles and thus improve their retention inside a formed web structure fbrm flocculation tests have good correlation with the actual retention efficiency in real life paper machines and are thus commonly used in evaluation of flocculant chemicals idea of anionic trash fixing is to fix disturbing substances from paper stock or pulp water onto the fibre surface and thus make the process water cleaner it is believed that pitch particles originating from wood cause problems in the papermaking process by inducing deposits and thus breaks in the paper web 9 11 23 fixing of the pitch particles onto surfaces of the cellulose fibres by using cationic polymers reduces this risk significantly the principle of the fixing test is based on the fact that if there is free pitch dispersed in water the water becomes turbid the addition of a cationic polymer fixes the pitch onto the paper fibre surface and the turbidity in the water phase decreases less disturbing substances in the paper stock water improve runnability of paper machines by decreasing the number of unwanted breaks during production 3 3 1 sludge dewatering samples for sludge dewateringtest were chosen by selecting derivatives with the highest charge prepared from each of the cellulose materials samples prepared both by the high consistency heterogeneous and homogeneous methods were chosen for comparison the performance of the selected samples is presented in fig 3 where the cst the capillary suction time is plotted against the amount of the polymer used described as dosing and expressed as kilograms per sludge dry ton the efficiency is at its best when a small dosing amount gives a low cst value it is seen that the samples made in the homogeneous dmac licl solution or the des suspension perform better than those made in the heterogeneous high consistency reaction system a major factor behind this difference is the higher charge of the samples prepared in a homogeneous solution or des suspension the homogeneity of the samples prepared in a homogeneous solution is presumably higher which is also reflected in their application performance the molecular weight of the derivatives does not seem to influence their performance notably and charge is ultimately the main factor affecting their efficiency the charge is plotted against dewatering performance in fig 4 despite the fact that the cationic charge of the cationic polyacrylamide is much higher the performance of the best cellulose derivatives is almost similar to that of the cationic polyacrylamide 3 3 2 fbrm flocculation tests the dynamic mean floc sizes acquired for samples selected by a similar principle as in the previous application are presented in fig 5 all the cationic cellulose samples clearly produce a smaller floc size than the reference polyacrylamide this is understandable because the molecular weight of the polyacrylamide reference is typically several or even tens of millions of g mol whereas cellulose is at its highest in the region of one or two million g mol however although the floc size with the cationic cellulose samples is smaller the flocs seem to be very resistant to shearing forces in fact after a longer mixing time an experiment with a stronger than usual shearing environment showed that the cationic cellulose samples gave an even bigger residual floc size than the reference polyacrylamide when comparing the different cellulose pulps the never dried pulp reached the highest values in comparison to the other cellulose pulps regardless of the modification method interestingly the never dried cationic cellulose derivative produced using the high consistency heterogeneous modification method reached higher values than all the derivatives prepared using the homogeneous modification method the mean floc sizes as a function of dosing received using the different cationic cellulose derivatives are presented in fig 6 in most cases a clear response for increasing the amount of dosing was seen and the floc size increased by adding a larger amount of the cationic cellulose derivatives the highest maximum floc sizes were achieved with a dosing of 12 kg t and was the highest for entry 15 never dried cellulose modified using the high consistency method statistical significance for the difference in maximum floc size for the two samples prepared from never dried cellulose entries 15 and 26 using either the high consistency heterogeneous method or homogenous method was p 0 01 to further evaluate the flocculation performance of individual cellulose derivatives the relationship between the maximum mean floc size and salt viscosity was compared as shown in fig 7 higher salt viscosity is an indication of higher molecular weight and higher molecular weight seems to give a larger mean floc size and thus more efficient flocculation performance clearly the largest flocs are achieved with the never dried charge 2 2 meq g maximum floc size 19 5 μm and domsjö pulp charge 2 3 meq g maximum floc size 19 2 μm derivatives that were prepared using the heterogeneous high consistency method when cellulose is dissolved in dmac licl the material loses its fibrillar nature subsequent cationization in dmac licl can also reduce the molecular weight of cellulose 8 and it is known that modification of cellulose in the des mixture also lowers molecular weight 18 and is typically not capable of solubilizing cellulose completely 34 even if the substitution of cellulose might be more inhomogeneous when prepared using the heterogeneous high consistency method the samples retain their fibrillar nature and thus can provide more structural kinks and curves for the formation of larger flocs unlike in sludge dewatering tests high cationic charge does not seem to be a requirement in fbrm tests 3 3 3 anionic trash fixing fixing performance of the selected samples is shown in fig 8 where turbidity removal has been plotted against flocculant dose it could be seen that the main influencing parameter in fixing performance was clearly the charge density although that alone does not explain the whole ranking order in the fixing performance entry 18 gives an equal performance with the reference whereas entry 33 and entry 36 perform even better than the reference polyamine the main difference between the entries 33 and 36 and the rest of the derivatives is the molecular weight the lower molecular weight of the domsjö pulp seems to be advantageous for providing a better fixing result regardless of the carge thus methods that lower the molecular weight of cellulose are not necessarily disadvantageous if the derivatives are used as fixatives furthermore even the highest charge density cationic cellulose samples have a notably lower charge density than the reference polyamine the charge density of which is close to 7 meq g thus the cationic cellulose samples can perform better than the commercial polyamines currently used for this purpose even when their charge density is lower 4 conclusions the highest cationic charges were received by using either the homogeneous modification method or the deep eutectic solvent based method cost wise the homogeneous method is not capable of competing with the manufacturing costs of cationic polyacrylamides 9 whereas the deep eutectic solvent method provides a better alternative the difficulty of processing cellulose is perhaps the single most important contributor for the limitations in degrees of substitution achievable by heterogeneous methods traditional heterogeneous mixing methods are not able to provide similar levels of cationic charge as homogeneous methods and have severe limitations for this purpose utilizing high shear mixing can provide a new inexpensive way to modify cellulose heterogeneously because it enables better penetration of reagents into the cellulose structure enables the control of reaction efficacy limiting factors and reagents and produces cationic derivatives with a higher charge a comparison of different cellulose pulps showed that never dried cellulose has a slightly higher reactivity than dried pulps especially using the high consistency heterogeneous modification method and that the molecular weight of the pulps has an influence on the maximum charge received using these methods careful selection of the pulp is thus required for efficient chemical modification cationic cellulose derivatives were subjected to a series of evaluations for their suitability for use as industrial flocculants and fixatives sludge dewatering tests showed that cationic cellulose is able to function at a good level with a performance close to that of cationic polyacrylamide high cationic charge is crucial for the performance of cationic cellulose derivatives in sludge dewatering in fbrm flocculation tests cationic cellulose forms flocs even if their size is smaller than the ones received using cationic polyacrylamide remarkably the flocs received by using cationic cellulose maintained their size for a noticeably longer period under vigorous stirring than the ones received using cationic polyacrylamide furthermore the flocs received with cationic cellulose were able to resist higher shearing forces than the ones received with cationic polyacrylamide high cationic charge is not a requirement for the performance of the cellulose derivatives in fbrm tests cationic cellulose derivatives can also perform better in anionic trash fixing tests when compared with a commercial cationic polyamine a better performance has been perceived even with a notably lower charge when compared with the cationic polyamine lower molecular weight seems to be advantageous in anionic trash fixing for the cationic cellulose derivatives high cationic charge further improves the performance of cationic cellulose derivatives in fixing tests in summary it was shown that cationic cellulose derivatives perform well as flocculants and fixatives and thus provide a biodegradable environmentally friendly alternative for currently used synthetic cationic polymers wastewater treatment remains one of the key issues in the management of environmental resources in the future and there is a requirement of long term solutions which do not further stress the environment cellulose would be an optional material for the preparation of wastewater treatment chemicals due to its renewability naturally high molecular weight and high availability in various parts of the world the chemical modification methods previously used have suffered from many drawbacks such as high cost and requirement for special grade pulps high consistency mixing combined with utilizing industrial quality cellulose pulp could provide an economical modification method that does not involve the use of toxic solvents expensive cellulose grades or require solubilization of cellulose many of these difficulties are also neglected by using deep eutectic solvents for the modification similar risks in toxicity and lack of biodegradability as in the case of synthetic cationic polymers 35 39 are notably reduced when cellulose derivatives are used instead therefore the cationic cellulose derivatives seem to be highly applicable for use as waste water treatment chemicals acknowledgments the experimental data

process is also proposed based on detected intermediates keywords clofibric acid fenton like process fe sulfonated zro2 mineralization 1 introduction recently concern regarding the presence of environmental xenobiotics such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps in wastewater treatment plant effluents surface ground and drinking water has been growing due to their adverse effects on aquatic life and potential impact on human health 1 2 several ppcps have been detected in natural waters e g wetlands lakes and rivers throughout the world and are widely recognized as emerging environmental contaminants 3 5 effluents from water and wastewater treatment plants wwtps are considered to be a major source of pharmaceutically active compounds phacs in aquatic environment since the efficient removal of numerous phacs is difficult to accomplish by the conventional wastewater treatment techniques such as coagulation flotation 6 adsorption 1 chemical precipitation 7 biofiltration 8 and biodegradtion 9 however it was reported that these conventional treatment processes could not remove more than 25 of ppcps 10 despite low detected concentrations of phacs their potential risk to human health and ecological environment still remains high because of their persistence and resistance to water and waste water treatment 11 12 clofibric acid cfa a widely used phac is an active primary metabolite of lipid regulating substances ethofyllinclofibrate etofibrate and clofibrate ethyl has been reported in surface and groundwater and was identified as refractory contaminant in the investigation of several municipal sewage influents 13 14 concentrations upto 10 μg l 1 have been detected in sewage treatment plant influents and effluents and in rivers lakes north sea ground and drinking waters 3 13 15 16 although its biological effects are not completely understood it is known to be associated with endocrine disruption through interference with cholesterol synthesis 17 in recent years most of the research work is focused on development of innovative and efficient technologies which are applicable for a complete removal of emerging organic pollutants advanced oxidation processes aops are considered as a promising technology for the treatment of wastewaters containing ppcps they are generally characterized by the generation of hydroxyl radicals which are considered as a strong oxidant hydroxyl radical with high oxidation potential is able to oxidize and mineralize almost a majority of organic molecules into co2 and inorganic ions degradation of emerging organic pollutants by oxidation processes using heterogeneous catalysts is considered to be one of the most effective techniques for water remediation several processes have been applied for the removal of cfa it has been observed that cfa is poorly degraded by oxidation methods such as ozonolysis 18 h2o2 uv 19 sunlight and uv photolysis 20 and tio2 uv 21 feooh derived catalysts and hydrotalcites and spinel like catalysts have been used in cfa degradation by fenton like process and ozonation 22 23 recently cfa removal was studied by uv per sulfate and uv chlorine processes 24 magnetic anion exchange resin 25 tio2 coconutshell powder composite 26 cu based catalysts in ozonation process 27 and by raspberry derived mesoporous carbon tubules 28 among the various approaches of generation of hydroxyl radicals the fenton reaction dissolved fe2 h2o2 is one of the most efficient processes to eliminate toxic compounds present in the wastewater and has been proven as a cost effective technique 29 30 compared to homogeneous analogs solid fenton type catalysts are more attractive due to the ease of handling the possibility to overcome ph limitation the absence of iron complexing by oxidation intermediates and removal and recovery of catalysts 31 the efficiency of the catalyst is dependent on a number of factors including its surface area acidic sites morphology and surface chemistry activated carbon 32 clays 33 resins or mesoporous materials 34 solid iron oxide minerals or zero valent iron 35 37 plasma treated hematite nanostructures 38 ferro ferric oxide fe3o4 nanoparticles coated on activated carbon 39 and several solid supports such as zeolites 40 41 have been studied in heterogeneous fenton like processes zirconia and fe supported zirconia as heterogeneous catalysts have been also used in catalytic and photocatalytic advanced oxidation processes 42 45 whereas sulfated zirconia have been only extensively applied in processes such as skeletal isomerization 46 alkylation 47 acylation 48 dehydration 49 and esterification 50 the potentiality of sulfonated zirconia as heterogeneous catalysts for pollutant abatement is explored a little among the above mentioned solid supports very few results have been reported on sulfated zirconia in catalytic advanced oxidation processes recently iron oxide promoted sulfated zirconia have been studied in o3 h2o2 oxidation process for acetic acid degradation 51 and fe zro2 bimetallic oxide have been used in the catalytic photo fenton process 52 to the best of our knowledge no study has been reported on fe sulfonated zro2 catalyst for cfa degradation in fenton like process therefore the iron oxide sulfonated zro2 catalyst incorporated with h2o2 may exhibit high efficiencies in fenton based advanced oxidation process this work is focused on the development of novel and stable catalytic materials for the abatement of emerging contaminants by fenton like process the present work investigates the efficiency of fe zro2 and fe sulfonated zro2 catalysts for the degradation and mineralization of cfa by fenton like process at ambient temperature and pressure fe zro2 catalysts were prepared by impregnation method and also fe sulfonated zirconia catalysts were prepared by sulfonation of zirconia followed by fe impregnation fe sulfonated zro2 exhibit high catalytic efficiency in

3 1 catalysts characterization table 1 shows fe metal content analysis weight ratios of the samples iron contents of fe zro2 and fe sulfonated zro2 catalysts were 4 3 and 4 1 respectively indicating that the final fe content is similar to the theoretical values based on complete deposition of fe on the zirconia in the impregnation procedure table 1 the summary of textural properties bet specific surface area pore volumeand xrd patterns of calcined zro2 sulfonated zro2 fe zro2 and fe sulfonated zro2 catalysts are presented in table 2 surface area and pore volume of zro2 and sulfonated zro2 catalysts were 115 7 and 105 9 m2 g and 0 163 and 0 153 ml g respectively whereas surface area and pore volume of fe zro2 and fe sulfonated zro2catalysts were 102 1 97 3 m2 g and 0 140 0 138 ml g respectively slight decrease of the surface area and pore volume of the zirconia samples was observed after sulfonation amd fe impregnation table 2 from xrd zirconium oxide and baddeleyte were the main crystalline phases observed in zro2 and sulfated zro2 catalysts however hematite zirconium oxide and baddeleyte phases were observed in fe impregnated samples when fe was impregnated on zirconia sulfonated zro2 and calcined at 550 c hematite α fe2o3 phase appeared with a decrease in surface area and pore volume the morphologies of 4 fe zro2 and 4 fe sulfonated zro2 catalysts were examined by esem edx as shown in fig 1 esem images fig 1a b of these two catalysts indicate that there are surface agglomerates on both of the catalysts iron oxide particles adhere loosely to the surface of zirconia as well as sulfonated zro2 and form plenty of round shape particles with few micrometers to few nonometers of size over the entire region the edx analysis was performed for detecting the distribution of elemental ratios which gave an excellent arrangement with nominal compositions the results of edx analysis of both fe impregnated zirconia and sulfonated zro2 catalysts given in the inset table of fig 1c d the edx spectra of fe zro2 and fe sulfonated zro2 catalysts revealed the presence of the o fe zr and s o fe zr elements respectively and the quantitative analysis of those elements are illustrated in fig 1c d 3 2 clofibric acid cfa degradation and mineralization the results of cfa degradation and hydrogen peroxide decomposition obtained during 6 h of heterogeneous fenton like reaction using fe 10 mg l in order to check homogeneous contribution of fe in toc removal zro2 sulfonated zro2 4 fe zro2 and 4 fe sulfonated zro2 catalysts at ambient conditions are shown in fig 2 a and b homogenous fenton process using 10 mg l of fe shows faster cfa degradation and hydrogen peroxide decomposition in very short reaction within 30 60 min time as expected among all these tested catalysts 4 fe sulfonated zro2 shows the highest activity for cfa degradation and h2o2 decomposition achieving 100 cfa conversion within 1 h and about 93 h2o2 decomposition in 6 h of fenton like process without any leaching of fe total cfa conversion and 80 h2o2 decomposition was also obtained with 4 fe zro2 in 6 h compared to sulfonated zro2 94 cfa conversion with 70 h2o2 decomposition in 6 h and zro2 80 cfa conversion with 65 h2o2 decomposition in 6 h upon impregnation of fe on sulfonated zro2 degradation efficiency increased see fig 2 during the test on adsorption negligible amount of cfa was found to be adsorbed on 4 fe sulfonated zro2 fig 3 shows the toc removal during fenton like process using fe 10 mg l zro2 sulfonated zro2 4 fe zro2 and 4 fe sulfonated zro2 catalysts at ambient conditions it can be seen that the mineralization degree was not higher than 14 and 17 respectivelywith zro2 sulfonated zro2 in 6 h of fenton like reaction see fig 3 however an enhancement in toc removal was observed when fe impregnated catalysts were introduced in fenton like process 4 fe zro2 show higher toc removal along with 47 mineralization in 6 h of fenton like reaction with 0 3 mg l of fe leaching the best activity and stability for cfa degradation and mineralization was observed using 4 fe sulfonated zro2catalyst achieving 57 degree of mineralization in 6 h of fenton like process without any leaching of fe to evidence the effect of dissolved fe3 on the performance of cfa degradation and mineralization by fenton like process a homogeneous catalytic experiment was performed using dissolved fe3 with a concentration of 10 mg l working at room temperature for the homogeneous fenton reaction total cfa conversion was observed in short period of time but with a low toc removal 35 in 6 h the obtained results indicate that fe impregnated on zro2 and sulfonated zro2 catalysts exhibit higher activity in fenton like it is important to note that 4 fe sulfonated zro2 is the promising catalyst for the degradation and mineralization of cfa by fenton like process as total cfa conversion within 1 h with a toc removal of 57 6 h was obtained at very mild reaction conditions during fenton like process cfa solutions have not been buffered to stave off of the presence of ions that may interefere in the reaction process some authors have reported that the phosphate ions acts as a substitute for surface hydroxyl groups 54 55 it is note that the pka value of cfa is 3 2 56 and hence it dissociates even in acidic aqueous solutions 3 3 reusability and recycling of 4 fe sulfonated zro2catalyst in order to establish the reusability and stability of catalyst for cfa removal reactions were performed in the presence of 4 fe sulfonated zro2 catalyst recovered after a run by filtering washing drying and calcining at 550 c for reuse in three consecutive runs and to assess its stability as shown in fig 4 like in the case of fresh catalyst a total disappearance of cfa occurred in less than 2 h it can be seen that the activity of these catalysts was maintained showing around 56 of toc removal after being used for three consecutive cycles which demonstarate the good stability of this catalyst from the literature it can be noted that there is formation of hydroxyl radicals because of strong interaction between oxidant and surface acidic sites of catalyst this abundance of surfacehydroxyl groups on the catalyst has been attributed to be one of the key factors contributing to the enhanced oh radical generation and as a result the present study witnessed the superior catalyst performance under the studied experimental conditions the highest activity and stability of the 4 fe sulfonated zro2 catalyst is probably due to the more acidic sites by sulfonation process on catalyst surface and also because of stable and well dispersed active species this fact may play a crucial role in the catalytic performance which shows that a sulfonation of the catalyst increased the surface acid sites which initiate the catalytic reaction 57 3 4 parametric study with 4 fe sulfonated zro2catalyst in fenton like process optimization of some important reaction parameters was conducted including the effects of hydrogen peroxide dosage temperature catalyst loading and ph therefore the performance of 4 fe sulfated zro2 has been studied in fenton like reaction for cfa degradation and mineralization with these parameters 3 4 1 effect of h2o2 concentration optimization of the h2o2 concentration in fenton like process is an important factor furthermore an intense dose of oxidant acts as hydroxyl radical scavenger and detracts the degradation efficiency 58 the influence of hydrogen peroxide dosage on the performance of cfa degradation by fenton like process using 4 fe sulfonated zro2 was investigated in the range from 0 5 to 2 0 g l at room temperature fig 5 i total removal of cfa was observed with all concentration ranges of h2o2 as it can be seen increasing the hydrogen peroxide concentration in the range of 0 5 and 2 0 g l did not lead to any improvement of toc removal instead the toc removal decreased around 8 and 11 this may be due to the fact that excessive h2o2 would rapidly scavenge ho with the resultant formation of the less reactive radical ho2 which could in turn inhibit the generation of ho all these facts together might be leading to low utilization of h2o2 for the degradation of target pollutant and intermediates 37 59 it can be understood that higher concentration of h2o2 is not effective for cfa mineralization in fenton like process using higher concentration 2 0 g l of h2o2 a fast decomposition of h2o2 was observed leading to a decrease in toc removal compared to reaction performed at lower h2o2 0 5 g l concentration thus 0 5 g l of h2o2 was chosen as an optimum dosage in fenton like process by taking the mineralization efficiency and economic condition into account 3 4 2 effect of reaction temperature fig 5 ii shows the influence of reaction temperature on degradation and mineralization of cfa in this series experiments were performed at room temperature 40 c and 60 c using 2 g l of 4 fe sulfonated zro2 and 0 5 g l of h2o2 from fig 5 ii it can be seen that by increasing the temperature toc removal increased by 6 11 in 6 h of fenton like process when compared to reaction performed at room temperature when temperature increases up to 40 ºc 66 toc removal is noticed in 6 h fig 5ii thus it can be concluded that a temperature increase enhances the mineralization degree since the fenton like process could be safely used with better efficiency under ambient conditions the reaction temperature was not recommended to rise beyond 40 c 3 4 3 effect of catalyst concentration the degradation and mineralization of cfa in the fenton like process by 4 fe sulfonated zro2 at free ph with different catalyst dosages 0 5 2 g l with 0 5 g l of h2o2 at room temperature were investigated toc removal and cfa degradation profiles of these reactions are shown in fig 5 iii achieving a mineralization degree of 43 for 1 g l of catalyst and 38 for 0 5 g l in 6 h of fenton like reaction when catalyst concentration decreased from 2 to 1 and 0 5 g l the toc removal was also decreased cfa conversion was also decreased from 100 to 95 with decreasing catalyst concentration with higher catalyst concentration degradation and mineralization efficiency of cfa was higher 100 cfa removal and 57 mineralization this was attributed to more active sites provided by the increasing catalyst dosages to activate h2o2 therefore yielding more radicals therefore under the circumstance of relatively high degradation and mineralization of cfa a catalyst dosage 2 0 g l was selected as the optimum concentration under the studied concentration range 3 4 4 effect of initial ph of solution generally ph is considered as an important parameter during the fenton like oxidation process the aqueous ph can affect the decomposition existing state of a dissociable organic compound the deprotonation reaction of h2o2 and the surface property of catalyst consequently leading to a change in fenton efficiency in this study catalytic oxidation of cfa in fenton like process by 4 fe sulfonated zro2was conducted at three different initial phs ph 3 3 3 5 free 5 and 7 to investigate their effects as fig 5 iv demonstrated cfa could be rapidly degraded and mineralized at free ph values however when the initial ph of the solution increased the removal efficiency was reduced compared to the degradation of cfa at ph 5 and 7 in 60 min the degradation efficiency decreased from almost 100 to about 80 and 50 at ph 5 and 7 respectively similar results were obtained to the optimum ph for the homogeneous and heterogeneous fenton like process as reported by other authors 60 61 also the reactions at initial ph 5 and 7 show a decrease in toc removal 46 and 39 respectively with respect to the reactions at free ph 3 5 56 as shown in fig 5 iv at the start of oxidation at initial ph 5 and 7 the ph dropped to less than 3 7 4 8 in ca 30 min likely due to the formation of acidic intermediates final ph of solution was 3 4 initial ph 5 and 4 5 initial ph 7 the decrease in degradation and mineralization efficiency observed at ph 5 and 7 might be due to formation of the inactive surface species and significant reduction in the number of active sites on the catalyst surface 62 also at high ph the efficient utilization of h2o2 would also decrease due to the accelerated decomposition of h2o2 into water and oxygen 63 3 5 tests with lower cfa concentration to check the efficiency of the 4 fe sulfonated zro2 catalyst with lower concentrations of cfa fenton like experiments were carried out at different lower concentrations 10 100 mg l and evolution of toc during reaction are depicted in fig 6 results indicate that the catalystis active in degradationand mineralizationof cfa at their lower concentration ranges in all tests cfa concentrations below our detection limit 0 1 mg l was observed after 1 h of heterogeneous fenton like reaction about 56 58 toc removal was achieved in 6 h of fenton like reaction with lower concentrations 10 25 and 50 mg l values of cfa see fig 6 it can be seen therefore that the efficiency in mineralization was maintained or even slightly enhanced at lower concentration values of cfa without any leaching of fe under our detection limit no reference for cfa degradation by fenton like process using fe sulfonated zro2 has been found therefore our results are very promising for cfa degradation and mineralization and fe sulfonated zro2 would be an interesting material to study in these type of processes since 100 cfa within 60 min and 57 toc removal in 6 h has been obtained without any leaching of fe at ambient conditions 3 6 proposed mechanism of cfa oxidation during fenton like process the oxidation of cfa by fenton like process in the presence of 4 fe sulfonated zro2 shows the formation of various intermediates the identification of oxidation by products was performed by hplc ms analysis of the samples taken during catalytic runs performed with 100 mg l of clofibric acid it should be said that all the intermediates were detected at negative ionization mode the compounds denoted by numbers in scheme 1 were detected by ms the possible mechanism of oxidation of cfa by fenton like process in the presence of 4 fe sulfonated zro2 catalysts is explained as follows cfa degradation can proceed possibly by three different routes scheme 1a c which are c 1 o bond breaking c4cl bond breaking and aromatic ring cleavage as shown in scheme 1 cfa undergoes oxidation to form 4 chlorophenol 1 by the breaking of c1o bond and also forming 2 hydroxybutyric acid 2 which were identified at m z 126 99 and m z 103 03 respectively further hydroxyl attack on c4 position of 4 chlorophenol yields hydroquinone 3 whereas oxidation at c2 position leads to formation of 4 chlorocatechol 4 detected at m z 109 02 and m z 142 99 respectively in second route scheme 1b of oxidation of cfa via attack at c4cl bond leads to the formation of 4 hydroxyphenoxy isobutyric acid 5 found at m z 196 07 which further undergoes oxidation through ring cleavage of cfa results in to the formation of 6 found at m z 245 02 this compound undergoes in oxidation process via ring cleavage path to form oxalic acid 7 identified at m z 88 98 and 2 hydroxyisobutyric acid hydroxylation scheme 1c of aromatic ring results in to the formation of 2 4 chloro 2 hydroxyphenoxy 2 methyl propionic acid 8 found at m z 229 02 subsequent oxidation cleavage the aromatic ring and form 2 hydroxy isobutyric acid 2 and chloro carboxylic acid 9 and 10 which were detected at m z 245 02 and 178 97 respectively 4 conclusions 4 fe impregnated on zro2 and sulfonated zro2 catalysts were successfully synthesized and used as heterogeneous catalysts in fenton like process for the degradation of cfa among all tested catalysts in this study 4 fe sulfonated zro2 was found to be an effective and stable catalyst attaining complete cfa degradation and high mineralization efficiencies this elevated performance of fe sulfonated zro2 when compared to other catalysts is understood to be due to the sulfonation of zirconia followed by fe impregnation which had a positive effect in the heterogeneous fenton like process no iron leaching has been observed during the reactions which indicates the stability of the fe sulfonated zro2 catalyst the sustained catalytic activity even after three cycles demonstrates the reusability potential of the catalyst additionally parametric study has also been performed with 4 fe sulfonated zro2 using different variables optimization of the reaction conditions like temperature 40 c free ph 3 5 h2o2 0 5 g l and proper loading of the catalyst 2 g l would lead to the highest mineralization degree under mild reaction conditions this opens up possible applications for removal of emerging contaminants by fully heterogeneous fenton like system using fe sulfonated zro2 catalysts further work is in

during the process thereby demonstrating the stability of the catalyst the sulfonation of zirconia has shown a positive effect in this process furthermore the effects of various operating parameters including initial solution ph catalyst load h2o2 concentration and reaction temperature were evaluated for the optimization of the process the possible mechanism of cfa oxidation during fenton like process is also proposed based on detected intermediates keywords clofibric acid fenton like process fe sulfonated zro2 mineralization 1 introduction recently concern regarding the presence of environmental xenobiotics such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps in wastewater treatment plant effluents surface ground and drinking water has been growing due to their adverse effects on aquatic life and potential impact on human health 1 2 several ppcps have been detected in natural waters e g wetlands lakes and rivers throughout the world and are widely recognized as emerging environmental contaminants 3 5 effluents from water and wastewater treatment plants wwtps are considered to be a major source of pharmaceutically active compounds phacs in aquatic environment since the efficient removal of numerous phacs is difficult to accomplish by the conventional wastewater treatment techniques such as coagulation flotation 6 adsorption 1 chemical precipitation 7 biofiltration 8 and biodegradtion 9 however it was reported that these conventional treatment processes could not remove more than 25 of ppcps 10 despite low detected concentrations of phacs their potential risk to human health and ecological environment still remains high because of their persistence and resistance to water and waste water treatment 11 12 clofibric acid cfa a widely used phac is an active primary metabolite of lipid regulating substances ethofyllinclofibrate etofibrate and clofibrate ethyl has been reported in surface and groundwater and was identified as refractory contaminant in the investigation of several municipal sewage influents 13 14 concentrations upto 10 μg l 1 have been detected in sewage treatment plant influents and effluents and in rivers lakes north sea ground and drinking waters 3 13 15 16 although its biological effects are not completely understood it is known to be associated with endocrine disruption through interference with cholesterol synthesis 17 in recent years most of the research work is focused on development of innovative and efficient technologies which are applicable for a complete removal of emerging organic pollutants advanced oxidation processes aops are considered as a promising technology for the treatment of wastewaters containing ppcps they are generally characterized by the generation of hydroxyl radicals which are considered as a strong oxidant hydroxyl radical with high oxidation potential is able to oxidize and mineralize almost a majority of organic molecules into co2 and inorganic ions degradation of emerging organic pollutants by oxidation processes using heterogeneous catalysts is considered to be one of the most effective techniques for water remediation several processes have been applied for the removal of cfa it has been observed that cfa is poorly degraded by oxidation methods such as ozonolysis 18 h2o2 uv 19 sunlight and uv photolysis 20 and tio2 uv 21 feooh derived catalysts and hydrotalcites and spinel like catalysts have been used in cfa degradation by fenton like process and ozonation 22 23 recently cfa removal was studied by uv per sulfate and uv chlorine processes 24 magnetic anion exchange resin 25 tio2 coconutshell powder composite 26 cu based catalysts in ozonation process 27 and by raspberry derived mesoporous carbon tubules 28 among the various approaches of generation of hydroxyl radicals the fenton reaction dissolved fe2 h2o2 is one of the most efficient processes to eliminate toxic compounds present in the wastewater and has been proven as a cost effective technique 29 30 compared to homogeneous analogs solid fenton type catalysts are more attractive due to the ease of handling the possibility to overcome ph limitation the absence of iron complexing by oxidation intermediates and removal and recovery of catalysts 31 the efficiency of the catalyst is dependent on a number of factors including its surface area acidic sites morphology and surface chemistry activated carbon 32 clays 33 resins or mesoporous materials 34 solid iron oxide minerals or zero valent iron 35 37 plasma treated hematite nanostructures 38 ferro ferric oxide fe3o4 nanoparticles coated on activated carbon 39 and several solid supports such as zeolites 40 41 have been studied in heterogeneous fenton like processes zirconia and fe supported zirconia as heterogeneous catalysts have been also used in catalytic and photocatalytic advanced oxidation processes 42 45 whereas sulfated zirconia have been only extensively applied in processes such as skeletal isomerization 46 alkylation 47 acylation 48 dehydration 49 and esterification 50 the potentiality of sulfonated zirconia as heterogeneous catalysts for pollutant abatement is explored a little among the above mentioned solid supports very few results have been reported on sulfated zirconia in catalytic advanced oxidation processes recently iron oxide promoted sulfated zirconia have been studied in o3 h2o2 oxidation process for acetic acid degradation 51 and fe zro2 bimetallic oxide have been used in the catalytic photo fenton process 52 to the best of our knowledge no study has been reported on fe sulfonated zro2 catalyst for cfa degradation in fenton like process therefore the iron oxide sulfonated zro2 catalyst incorporated with h2o2 may exhibit high efficiencies in fenton based advanced oxidation process this work is focused on the development of novel and stable catalytic materials for the abatement of emerging contaminants by fenton like process the present work investigates the efficiency of fe zro2 and fe sulfonated zro2 catalysts for the degradation and mineralization of cfa by fenton like process at ambient temperature and pressure fe zro2 catalysts were prepared by impregnation method and also fe sulfonated zirconia catalysts were prepared by sulfonation of zirconia followed by fe impregnation fe sulfonated zro2 exhibit high catalytic efficiency in cfa removal and mineralization in addition effect of parameters like temperature catalyst concentration ph and h2o2 concentrationon the cfa degradation and mineralization were studied 2 materials and

total surface area was calculated by the bet method an environmental scanning electron microscope esem were used to analyze the surface morphology of fe impregnated zro2 and sulfonated zro2 catalysts

3 1 catalysts characterization table 1 shows fe metal content analysis weight ratios of the samples iron contents of fe zro2 and fe sulfonated zro2 catalysts were 4 3 and 4 1 respectively indicating that the final fe content is similar to the theoretical values based on complete deposition of fe on the zirconia in the impregnation procedure table 1 the summary of textural properties bet specific surface area pore volumeand xrd patterns of calcined zro2 sulfonated zro2 fe zro2 and fe sulfonated zro2 catalysts are presented in table 2 surface area and pore volume of zro2 and sulfonated zro2 catalysts were 115 7 and 105 9 m2 g and 0 163 and 0 153 ml g respectively whereas surface area and pore volume of fe zro2 and fe sulfonated zro2catalysts were 102 1 97 3 m2 g and 0 140 0 138 ml g respectively slight decrease of the surface area and pore volume of the zirconia samples was observed after sulfonation amd fe impregnation table 2 from xrd zirconium oxide and baddeleyte were the main crystalline phases observed in zro2 and sulfated zro2 catalysts however hematite zirconium oxide and baddeleyte phases were observed in fe impregnated samples when fe was impregnated on zirconia sulfonated zro2 and calcined at 550 c hematite α fe2o3 phase appeared with a decrease in surface area and pore volume the morphologies of 4 fe zro2 and 4 fe sulfonated zro2 catalysts were examined by esem edx as shown in fig 1 esem images fig 1a b of these two catalysts indicate that there are surface agglomerates on both of the catalysts iron oxide particles adhere loosely to the surface of zirconia as well as sulfonated zro2 and form plenty of round shape particles with few micrometers to few nonometers of size over the entire region the edx analysis was performed for detecting the distribution of elemental ratios which gave an excellent arrangement with nominal compositions the results of edx analysis of both fe impregnated zirconia and sulfonated zro2 catalysts given in the inset table of fig 1c d the edx spectra of fe zro2 and fe sulfonated zro2 catalysts revealed the presence of the o fe zr and s o fe zr elements respectively and the quantitative analysis of those elements are illustrated in fig 1c d 3 2 clofibric acid cfa degradation and mineralization the results of cfa degradation and hydrogen peroxide decomposition obtained during 6 h of heterogeneous fenton like reaction using fe 10 mg l in order to check homogeneous contribution of fe in toc removal zro2 sulfonated zro2 4 fe zro2 and 4 fe sulfonated zro2 catalysts at ambient conditions are shown in fig 2 a and b homogenous fenton process using 10 mg l of fe shows faster cfa degradation and hydrogen peroxide decomposition in very short reaction within 30 60 min time as expected among all these tested catalysts 4 fe sulfonated zro2 shows the highest activity for cfa degradation and h2o2 decomposition achieving 100 cfa conversion within 1 h and about 93 h2o2 decomposition in 6 h of fenton like process without any leaching of fe total cfa conversion and 80 h2o2 decomposition was also obtained with 4 fe zro2 in 6 h compared to sulfonated zro2 94 cfa conversion with 70 h2o2 decomposition in 6 h and zro2 80 cfa conversion with 65 h2o2 decomposition in 6 h upon impregnation of fe on sulfonated zro2 degradation efficiency increased see fig 2 during the test on adsorption negligible amount of cfa was found to be adsorbed on 4 fe sulfonated zro2 fig 3 shows the toc removal during fenton like process using fe 10 mg l zro2 sulfonated zro2 4 fe zro2 and 4 fe sulfonated zro2 catalysts at ambient conditions it can be seen that the mineralization degree was not higher than 14 and 17 respectivelywith zro2 sulfonated zro2 in 6 h of fenton like reaction see fig 3 however an enhancement in toc removal was observed when fe impregnated catalysts were introduced in fenton like process 4 fe zro2 show higher toc removal along with 47 mineralization in 6 h of fenton like reaction with 0 3 mg l of fe leaching the best activity and stability for cfa degradation and mineralization was observed using 4 fe sulfonated zro2catalyst achieving 57 degree of mineralization in 6 h of fenton like process without any leaching of fe to evidence the effect of dissolved fe3 on the performance of cfa degradation and mineralization by fenton like process a homogeneous catalytic experiment was performed using dissolved fe3 with a concentration of 10 mg l working at room temperature for the homogeneous fenton reaction total cfa conversion was observed in short period of time but with a low toc removal 35 in 6 h the obtained results indicate that fe impregnated on zro2 and sulfonated zro2 catalysts exhibit higher activity in fenton like it is important to note that 4 fe sulfonated zro2 is the promising catalyst for the degradation and mineralization of cfa by fenton like process as total cfa conversion within 1 h with a toc removal of 57 6 h was obtained at very mild reaction conditions during fenton like process cfa solutions have not been buffered to stave off of the presence of ions that may interefere in the reaction process some authors have reported that the phosphate ions acts as a substitute for surface hydroxyl groups 54 55 it is note that the pka value of cfa is 3 2 56 and hence it dissociates even in acidic aqueous solutions 3 3 reusability and recycling of 4 fe sulfonated zro2catalyst in order to establish the reusability and stability of catalyst for cfa removal reactions were performed in the presence of 4 fe sulfonated zro2 catalyst recovered after a run by filtering washing drying and calcining at 550 c for reuse in three consecutive runs and to assess its stability as shown in fig 4 like in the case of fresh catalyst a total disappearance of cfa occurred in less than 2 h it can be seen that the activity of these catalysts was maintained showing around 56 of toc removal after being used for three consecutive cycles which demonstarate the good stability of this catalyst from the literature it can be noted that there is formation of hydroxyl radicals because of strong interaction between oxidant and surface acidic sites of catalyst this abundance of surfacehydroxyl groups on the catalyst has been attributed to be one of the key factors contributing to the enhanced oh radical generation and as a result the present study witnessed the superior catalyst performance under the studied experimental conditions the highest activity and stability of the 4 fe sulfonated zro2 catalyst is probably due to the more acidic sites by sulfonation process on catalyst surface and also because of stable and well dispersed active species this fact may play a crucial role in the catalytic performance which shows that a sulfonation of the catalyst increased the surface acid sites which initiate the catalytic reaction 57 3 4 parametric study with 4 fe sulfonated zro2catalyst in fenton like process optimization of some important reaction parameters was conducted including the effects of hydrogen peroxide dosage temperature catalyst loading and ph therefore the performance of 4 fe sulfated zro2 has been studied in fenton like reaction for cfa degradation and mineralization with these parameters 3 4 1 effect of h2o2 concentration optimization of the h2o2 concentration in fenton like process is an important factor furthermore an intense dose of oxidant acts as hydroxyl radical scavenger and detracts the degradation efficiency 58 the influence of hydrogen peroxide dosage on the performance of cfa degradation by fenton like process using 4 fe sulfonated zro2 was investigated in the range from 0 5 to 2 0 g l at room temperature fig 5 i total removal of cfa was observed with all concentration ranges of h2o2 as it can be seen increasing the hydrogen peroxide concentration in the range of 0 5 and 2 0 g l did not lead to any improvement of toc removal instead the toc removal decreased around 8 and 11 this may be due to the fact that excessive h2o2 would rapidly scavenge ho with the resultant formation of the less reactive radical ho2 which could in turn inhibit the generation of ho all these facts together might be leading to low utilization of h2o2 for the degradation of target pollutant and intermediates 37 59 it can be understood that higher concentration of h2o2 is not effective for cfa mineralization in fenton like process using higher concentration 2 0 g l of h2o2 a fast decomposition of h2o2 was observed leading to a decrease in toc removal compared to reaction performed at lower h2o2 0 5 g l concentration thus 0 5 g l of h2o2 was chosen as an optimum dosage in fenton like process by taking the mineralization efficiency and economic condition into account 3 4 2 effect of reaction temperature fig 5 ii shows the influence of reaction temperature on degradation and mineralization of cfa in this series experiments were performed at room temperature 40 c and 60 c using 2 g l of 4 fe sulfonated zro2 and 0 5 g l of h2o2 from fig 5 ii it can be seen that by increasing the temperature toc removal increased by 6 11 in 6 h of fenton like process when compared to reaction performed at room temperature when temperature increases up to 40 ºc 66 toc removal is noticed in 6 h fig 5ii thus it can be concluded that a temperature increase enhances the mineralization degree since the fenton like process could be safely used with better efficiency under ambient conditions the reaction temperature was not recommended to rise beyond 40 c 3 4 3 effect of catalyst concentration the degradation and mineralization of cfa in the fenton like process by 4 fe sulfonated zro2 at free ph with different catalyst dosages 0 5 2 g l with 0 5 g l of h2o2 at room temperature were investigated toc removal and cfa degradation profiles of these reactions are shown in fig 5 iii achieving a mineralization degree of 43 for 1 g l of catalyst and 38 for 0 5 g l in 6 h of fenton like reaction when catalyst concentration decreased from 2 to 1 and 0 5 g l the toc removal was also decreased cfa conversion was also decreased from 100 to 95 with decreasing catalyst concentration with higher catalyst concentration degradation and mineralization efficiency of cfa was higher 100 cfa removal and 57 mineralization this was attributed to more active sites provided by the increasing catalyst dosages to activate h2o2 therefore yielding more radicals therefore under the circumstance of relatively high degradation and mineralization of cfa a catalyst dosage 2 0 g l was selected as the optimum concentration under the studied concentration range 3 4 4 effect of initial ph of solution generally ph is considered as an important parameter during the fenton like oxidation process the aqueous ph can affect the decomposition existing state of a dissociable organic compound the deprotonation reaction of h2o2 and the surface property of catalyst consequently leading to a change in fenton efficiency in this study catalytic oxidation of cfa in fenton like process by 4 fe sulfonated zro2was conducted at three different initial phs ph 3 3 3 5 free 5 and 7 to investigate their effects as fig 5 iv demonstrated cfa could be rapidly degraded and mineralized at free ph values however when the initial ph of the solution increased the removal efficiency was reduced compared to the degradation of cfa at ph 5 and 7 in 60 min the degradation efficiency decreased from almost 100 to about 80 and 50 at ph 5 and 7 respectively similar results were obtained to the optimum ph for the homogeneous and heterogeneous fenton like process as reported by other authors 60 61 also the reactions at initial ph 5 and 7 show a decrease in toc removal 46 and 39 respectively with respect to the reactions at free ph 3 5 56 as shown in fig 5 iv at the start of oxidation at initial ph 5 and 7 the ph dropped to less than 3 7 4 8 in ca 30 min likely due to the formation of acidic intermediates final ph of solution was 3 4 initial ph 5 and 4 5 initial ph 7 the decrease in degradation and mineralization efficiency observed at ph 5 and 7 might be due to formation of the inactive surface species and significant reduction in the number of active sites on the catalyst surface 62 also at high ph the efficient utilization of h2o2 would also decrease due to the accelerated decomposition of h2o2 into water and oxygen 63 3 5 tests with lower cfa concentration to check the efficiency of the 4 fe sulfonated zro2 catalyst with lower concentrations of cfa fenton like experiments were carried out at different lower concentrations 10 100 mg l and evolution of toc during reaction are depicted in fig 6 results indicate that the catalystis active in degradationand mineralizationof cfa at their lower concentration ranges in all tests cfa concentrations below our detection limit 0 1 mg l was observed after 1 h of heterogeneous fenton like reaction about 56 58 toc removal was achieved in 6 h of fenton like reaction with lower concentrations 10 25 and 50 mg l values of cfa see fig 6 it can be seen therefore that the efficiency in mineralization was maintained or even slightly enhanced at lower concentration values of cfa without any leaching of fe under our detection limit no reference for cfa degradation by fenton like process using fe sulfonated zro2 has been found therefore our results are very promising for cfa degradation and mineralization and fe sulfonated zro2 would be an interesting material to study in these type of processes since 100 cfa within 60 min and 57 toc removal in 6 h has been obtained without any leaching of fe at ambient conditions 3 6 proposed mechanism of cfa oxidation during fenton like process the oxidation of cfa by fenton like process in the presence of 4 fe sulfonated zro2 shows the formation of various intermediates the identification of oxidation by products was performed by hplc ms analysis of the samples taken during catalytic runs performed with 100 mg l of clofibric acid it should be said that all the intermediates were detected at negative ionization mode the compounds denoted by numbers in scheme 1 were detected by ms the possible mechanism of oxidation of cfa by fenton like process in the presence of 4 fe sulfonated zro2 catalysts is explained as follows cfa degradation can proceed possibly by three different routes scheme 1a c which are c 1 o bond breaking c4cl bond breaking and aromatic ring cleavage as shown in scheme 1 cfa undergoes oxidation to form 4 chlorophenol 1 by the breaking of c1o bond and also forming 2 hydroxybutyric acid 2 which were identified at m z 126 99 and m z 103 03 respectively further hydroxyl attack on c4 position of 4 chlorophenol yields hydroquinone 3 whereas oxidation at c2 position leads to formation of 4 chlorocatechol 4 detected at m z 109 02 and m z 142 99 respectively in second route scheme 1b of oxidation of cfa via attack at c4cl bond leads to the formation of 4 hydroxyphenoxy isobutyric acid 5 found at m z 196 07 which further undergoes oxidation through ring cleavage of cfa results in to the formation of 6 found at m z 245 02 this compound undergoes in oxidation process via ring cleavage path to form oxalic acid 7 identified at m z 88 98 and 2 hydroxyisobutyric acid hydroxylation scheme 1c of aromatic ring results in to the formation of 2 4 chloro 2 hydroxyphenoxy 2 methyl propionic acid 8 found at m z 229 02 subsequent oxidation cleavage the aromatic ring and form 2 hydroxy isobutyric acid 2 and chloro carboxylic acid 9 and 10 which were detected at m z 245 02 and 178 97 respectively 4 conclusions 4 fe impregnated on zro2 and sulfonated zro2 catalysts were successfully synthesized and used as heterogeneous catalysts in fenton like process for the degradation of cfa among all tested catalysts in this study 4 fe sulfonated zro2 was found to be an effective and stable catalyst attaining complete cfa degradation and high mineralization efficiencies this elevated performance of fe sulfonated zro2 when compared to other catalysts is understood to be due to the sulfonation of zirconia followed by fe impregnation which had a positive effect in the heterogeneous fenton like process no iron leaching has been observed during the reactions which indicates the stability of the fe sulfonated zro2 catalyst the sustained catalytic activity even after three cycles demonstrates the reusability potential of the catalyst additionally parametric study has also been performed with 4 fe sulfonated zro2 using different variables optimization of the reaction conditions like temperature 40 c free ph 3 5 h2o2 0 5 g l and proper loading of the catalyst 2 g l would lead to the highest mineralization degree under mild reaction conditions this opens up possible applications for removal of emerging contaminants by fully heterogeneous fenton like system using fe sulfonated zro2 catalysts further work is in

containing flue gas and the emission without proper treatment will cause an air pollution therefore the flue gas desulfurization fgd of coal fired power plants is a necessary technique which can control the source of air pollution fgd technology is widely used due to an efficiency above 95 high concentration of salt containing wastewater is produced during the desulfurization process the typical fgd wastewater contains heavy metal ions high turbidity high hardness high chlorides high sulfate and a low ph value shown in table 1 the conventional treatment method for this wastewater is by chemical precipitation heavy metal ions in wastewater are precipitated by chemicals addition into the wastewater 1 3 however there are many drawbacks for this conventional process such as high operating cost because of the large amount of chemical agent needed high maintenance cost difficulty in recycling and harmful elements with the increasing environmental protection restrictions the zero liquid discharge zld for fgd wastewater has become the focus of pollution prevention and control methods in coal fired power plants normally zld system for fgd wastewater include two stage softening pretreatment system for reverse osmosis bwro swro or dtro system forward osmosis fo membrane process and crystallizer processes 4 6 these papers provided some cases and application results for these kinds of treating methods such as the oasys fo membrane system which was applied in changxing power plant china these processes are used to obtain 40 60 wastewater recovery and remove the ca2 mg2 heavy metals and so4 2 in the wastewater 7 these systems also need to supply large amount of additional energy and chemical agents for operation large investment and high operating cost additionally the process of the whole system has high manpower and maintenance requirements fgd wastewater evaporation by flue gas technology from the coal fired power plant was introduced by some researchers it was found that if the evaporation is incomplete it may cause corrosion to flue duct and downstream devices because of acidic fgd wastewater quantitative relation between the water evaporation rate and various factors have not been determined yet and dynamics model with high fitting degree is still rare these problems constrained the theoretical research and commercial application for this technology 8 9 a thermogravimetric analyzer tga with differential scanning calorimetry dsc fuction and scanning electron microscope sem were used to evaporate to a droplet and observe the morphology of the crystals it was found that the difference of the temperature and the concentration leads to a higher crystallization rate at higher temperature increasing rate evaporation rate per unit volume is relatively high at low volume of the droplet 10 fgd wastewater was sprayed into the flue duct in a coal fired power plant and the wastewater contacted with the high temperature 120 150 flue gas when the fgd wastewater was evaporated the residual solid and salt in the wastewater would be captured by the downstream dedusting system esp electrical static precipitator compared with the conventional fgd wastewater zld processes no additional energy is needed in this system because the exhausted heat of the flue gas is used as the energy source to evaporate the wastewater although there are many previous studies documenting leaching characterization evaporation effectiveness and transient evaporation 11 14 there are few studies devoted to the mechanism the degree of consistency between theory and engineering application of this technology the key factor of flue gas spray evaporation technology is to evaporate the volume of fgd wastewater within a certain time with no negative effect on the flue structure and downstream process therefore the tiny droplets formed by fgd wastewater should be completely vaporized as soon as possible after being sprayed into the flue duct otherwise if the droplets are not completely evaporated the flue duct and downstream esp will be corroded by the wastewater because the fgd wastewater is acidic in this paper the evaporation processes of fgd wastewater droplets group were studied by numerical simulation software different amount of fgd wastewater were spray into the flue duct of a coal fired power plant the relation between simulation results by software and the engineering application results were studied the influences of various parameters on the wastewater droplets evaporative characteristics such as boiler load conditions the ratio number of droplets captured by the flue wall to the total number of droplets atomization cone angle volume of wastewater droplet temperature of flue gas and fly ash characteristics after the injection of fgd wastewater were evaluated in order to verify the numerical model and provide guidelines for future commercial applications the experiment which is base on the numerical simulation results and the engineering measured data was performed this paper presents the numerical simulation methods and then compares the engineering results with these simulation results the main goal is to achieve a guideline for the zld evaporation process of fgd wastewater 2 methods in this study 3 two fluid compressed air and wastewater nozzles were uniformly arranged in the vertical section of flue duct in a 330 mw coal fired power plant the nozzles were set in the elevation of 13 8 m the fgd wastewater was pretreated by the chemical precipitation the effluents stored in a buffer tank and then sent to the wastewater dispenser by the spray feed pump the water dispenser distributes the water to the three atomization nozzles an air purifier removes oil and small particles from compressed plant air then the air enters the compressed air dispenser and the compressed air atomization nozzle distributes air by the compressed air distributor three atomizing nozzles can be operated with the same parameters to provide of the uniformity of the atomizing nozzles the power plant provided combustion calculations the heat balance calculations the characteristic parameters temperature drop of flue gas and the influence of fly ash after the injection of fgd wastewater the fgd wastewater flue evaporation process in flue duct is shown in fig 1 ansa and fluent software were used as the tools to simulate the evaporation process of fgd wastewater during the simulation and calculation of atomization droplet evaporation it is assumed that 1 compressed air is a continuous phase and fgd wastewater atomization droplet is a discrete phase both of them at constant temperature 2 ignoring the influence of nozzle nozzle pipe and other components on the flue duct field 3 the mach number of flue gas is low that can be assumed as an incompressible fluid 4 ignoring the heat transfer between the wall of the flue duct and the flue gas and the boundary condition is set to adiabatic 5 when the atomized liquid drops it contacts the wall surface of the flue duct to be captured immediately the droplet stop track is calculated all the mass is converted into a vapor phase instantly and enters the grid connected with the wall surface 6 the liquid drop particles are approximately spherical and ignoring the heat transfer thermal resistance inside the liquid drops and ignoring the fusion and crushing caused by collision between the droplet particles 2 1 physical model the flue duct structure arrangement of atomizing nozzles flue gas distribution in the flue duct between the air preheater and the esp and the droplets distribution after fgd wastewater injected into the flue duct are shown in fig 2 the vertical color column is the velocity of flue gas the flue duct is divided into six parts entrance section lower bend vertical section upper bend special shaped bend and horizontal flue duct ansa software was used to develop a mesh of the geometric model of the flue duct the structure of the flue duct is simple and the structure of the flow field is uniform the total hexahedral mesh has an obvious advantage over the tetrahedral mesh in the speed calculation the total number of grid numbers is about 2 3 million 2 2 mathematical model 2 2 1 continuous phase equations the turbulent flow field of spray evaporation of fgd wastewater can be described by the lagrange and euler method the transient motion of each turbulent pulsating microparticle can be described by lagrangian method when compared with eula method it cannot describe the flow distribution of the whole flow field clearly therefore in the actual numerical simulation the euler coordinate system is used as the tool to solve the turbulent flow in the flue gas phase the governing equations of the main variables e g velocity and temperature required in the process are expressed as the following general equation 15 1 ρ ϕ t div ρ u ϕ div γ ϕ grad ϕ s ϕ s ϕ p where ø is a universal variable which represent u v w t mixing fraction f and enthalpy value h γø is generalized diffusion coefficient sø is gas phase induced generalized source and søp is solid particle induced source the ø 1 eq 1 is a continuity equation the governing equation was calculated using the continuous phase standard k ε turbulence model 16 and the standard wall equation is chosen near the flue duct wall the model is sufficient to describe the steady flow field in this project because it does not involve the intense distortion and rotation of the flow field 2 2 2 discrete phase equations in the process of discrete phase solution the lagrangian particle random orbit model is widely used the model is simple to calculate and it can track and record the moving track and state of particles at the same time the coupling effect of gas phase turbulence pulsation and discrete phase particles was considered 17 the equation of motive particles is shown as follows 2 m p d u p d t f p m p g only the effect of drag is considered 3 f d 18 μ ρ p d p 2 c d re 24 4 r e p ρ d p u p u μ where cd is the resistance coefficient μ is the dynamic viscosity of flue gas ρp is the density of droplets dp is the average diameter of droplets and rep is the reynolds number of particles because the temperature of spray droplets around 300 k is much lower than flue gas around 400k the temperature of flue gas varies with the change of the loads of power plant type of coal and type of boiler the droplets will absorb the heat of flue gas and vaporize it into water vapor after it is injected into the flue duct when the temperature of the droplets is lower than its boiling point the phase transition of the droplets is mainly an evaporation process and the model of droplets evaporation is shown as follows 5 m p t δ t m p t n i a p m w i δ t where the item on the left is the mass of the droplet after phase transition and mp t is the mass before the phase transition ni is the evaporation rate per unit area of the droplet ap is the surface area of the droplet mw i is the molecular weight of the evaporating component and δt is the time step when the temperature of the droplet is higher than its boiling point the phase transition of the droplet is mainly a boiling process and the model of droplet boiling is shown as follows 6 d d p d t 4 k ρ p c p d p 1 0 23 r e d l n 1 c p t t p h f g where cp is specific heat capacity of the gas at constant pressure k is the thermal conductivity of the gas phase and hfg is the latent heat of gasification 2 3 boundary conditions in this paper three different boiler loads were chosen the flue gas from the exit section of the air preheater is selected as the gas phase result it mainly consisted of five components included h2o co2 o2 so2 and n2 the components transport model was used to simulate the composition of the mixture the wastewater droplets at room temperature were chosen as the liquid phase research object the whole process can be considered as an evaporation process the parameters of gas liquid two phase flow field boundary conditions are shown in table 2 the enthalpy value of flue gas at different boiler loads was calculated by eq 7 which determined whether the maximum amount of fgd wastewater can be evaporated by the evaporation method completely without affecting the downstream esp process 7 hg h g α 1 h a hfly where hg is calculated enthalpy of flue gas kj kg h g is theoretical enthalpy of flue gas kj kg h a is theoretical enthalpy of air kj kg hfly is theoretical enthalpy of fly ash kj kg α is excess air coefficient of different unit loads α is 1 38 1 42 and 1 68 respectively at 100 75 and 50 boiler load with the increase of boiler load the enthalpy value of flue gas and fly ash will also increase 3 results and discussion the evaporation effect of droplets is mainly determined by the following parameters flue gas phase temperature and transport characteristics liquid phase temperature and velocity of movement heat and mass transfer efficiency of gas liquid two phases according to the boundary conditions given in table 2 the load of 50 75 and 100 were analyzed the three kinds of gas phase conditions with different flue gas temperature 120 125 128 9 and flue velocity 9 19 m s 1 11 56 m s 1 14 64 m s 1 show that the effects of gas phase conditions on evaporation and flow characteristics of fgd wastewater are presented and are explained by heat and mass transfer theory 3 1 the influence of spray cone angle and boiler load on the droplet group evaporation time under the conditions of 50 75 and 100 boiler loads the fgd wastewater was sprayed into the flue duct with different atomization cone angles the simulated results of the relationship between the maximum evaporation time of the droplet and the atomization cone angles are shown in fig 3 the value of time shows the downward trend with the increase of the boiler load the maximum evaporation time of droplets in 50 75 and 100 boiler load conditions is in the range of 0 56 1 16 s in order to analyze quantitatively the effect of atomization cone angles on the flow characteristics of atomized droplets the ratio number of droplets captured by the flue wall to the total number of droplets is defined as a0 the quantitative analysis results of evaporation and flow characteristics of fgd wastewater with six different atomization cone angles under the boiler load of 50 75 and 100 respectively is shown in fig 4 the results of droplet number fraction captured on the wall of single flue under six different atomization cone angles of 20 35 50 65 80 95 shows that the number of droplets caught on the wall of flue duct initially decreased up to 50 60 and then increased significantly with the increase of the atomization cone angles the change of a0 value is stable when the angle of atomization cone was increased from 20 to 50 and when increased to 65 a0 reaches the minimum in the process of increasing the atomization cone angle from 65 to 95 the value of a0 was increased but when larger than 90 the increasing rate slowed down or decreased the atomization cone angle 65 was chosen as optimum angle in the following research this is an instructive method to determine the optimum cone angle 3 2 the simulated effect of load on evaporation and movement of droplet group the particle trajectory of different boiler load under the atomization cone angle of 65 is shown in fig 5 the maximum evaporation time corresponding to 100 boiler load was the shortest and the 50 boiler load was the longest for complete evaporation of droplets for droplets of the same size the higher the ambient temperature the faster the flue gas the higher the vaporization rate and the better evaporation effect that can be achieved when droplets of the same size among them the change of flue gas velocity has little effect on the maximum complete evaporation time and the larger flue gas velocity makes the trajectory of droplet particles moving under 100 boiler load is the longest compared with that of 50 75 if the flue duct length is insufficient there is the possibility of incomplete evaporation therefore in the flue duct the flue gas temperature plays a leading role in evaporation effect with the increases of boiler load the flue gas temperature increased the temperature difference between the gas and liquid phase increased and also the heat transfer from the gas phase to the droplet group increased so that it increased the evaporation and mass transfer rate of the droplet surface therefore the droplet temperature continued to rise the evaporation time becomes shorter so the residence time of droplets from injecting into the flue duct and evaporating gradually decreased with the increase of flue gas temperature 3 3 vector distribution analysis of droplet evaporation and motion the atomization and evaporation of fgd wastewater in flue duct can be divided into initial and steady stage in the initial stage the liquid droplets at room temperature are used as the distributed heat sink of endothermic evaporation that can fully absorb the exhausted heat of flue gas most of the heat absorbed was used as the heat sources to increase the droplet temperature and at the same time the droplet group velocity in this stage increased continuously under the influence of the flue gas velocity in a very short time the atomized droplets reach to the steady state when the droplet group was heated to a stable value by the flue gas all the heat absorbed by wastewater was used for the evaporation of the droplet group and the droplet velocity was consistent with that of the incoming flue gas the optimum nozzle spray cone angle of 65 flue section velocity vector of flue duct structure under 75 load condition is further analyzed in fig 6 from the distribution of droplet velocity vector the initial stage of spray evaporation shows that the mass transfer diffusion and evaporation rate is faster and a large irregular vortex was formed in the flue gas shear entrainment by spray due to the large volume flow of flue gas inside the flue that rushed into the opposite wall at a faster speed results in a large pressure difference in the upper part of the flue this means that the closer it was to the inside of the flue the larger the vortex that was formed it was also beneficial to the diffusion of local droplets in the nozzle region to other regions 3 4 results of injecting different amount of fgd wastewater under different boiler load conditions the length of flue duct from the nozzle of waste water to the inlet of esp is 34 5 m and the residence time of flue gas in flue duct was always more than 2 s under different loads the total fgd wastewater evaporation characters of the three nozzles under the conditions of different boiler load is shown in fig 7 fig 7 a shows that with the increase of boiler load the increase of flue gas temperature drop can be caused by the increase of fgd wastewater injection this was subsequently due to the increase of boiler load the increase of flue gas temperature and flue gas enthalpy value that was lower than the heat enthalpy value needed for complete evaporation of wastewater fig 7 b shows that the increase of both the boiler load and the quantity of wastewater the time of total evaporation of wastewater will reduce the smaller the amount of wastewater injected less evaporation time was needed this was due to the increase of boiler load and the increase of flue gas volume that will cause the increase of flue gas velocity and the rise of flue gas temperature therefore the heat transfer between flue gas and wastewater will occur more intensely the evaporation time is 0 5 1 2 s as shown in fig 3 it can be seen from 7 c that the inlet flue temperature of the esp was above 115 which was higher than the acid dew point in the flue gas and no corrosion was found in the structure of esp the internal conditions of flue duct after two months of continuous operation is shown in fig 8 after running for this time there was no obvious ash deposition in the bend and horizontal section of flue duct according to the chloride balance calculation of fgd wastewater cl concentration of approximately 20 000 mg l the residuals were incorporated into the fly ash the total amount of the solids evaporated that were incorporated into the precipitated fly ash were less than 0 6 and the content of cl in the total fly ash was about 0 15 according to the code of universal silicates cement the content of cl in the medium is not more than 0 06 the amount of fly ash portland cement mixed with fly ash was between 20 and less than 40 the cl content of fgd wastewater was incorporated into the fly ash and mixed with the portland cement the content of cement cl was within the range of 0 03 0 06 which can meet the code requirements in table 1 the concentration of na is between 15 000 and 20 000 mg l 1 na ions cannot be removed in the precipitation stage the accumulation of na has little influence on the quality of portland cement because there is no restrict limitations on na residuals during the boiler load was 100 2 m3 h of fgd wastewater were sprayed into the flue duct resulting in an absolute dry fly ash of about 50 120 kg h the fly ash was automatically removed by the esp system through the ash hopper into the ash storage system the zld system can be operated in a continuous mode and there are no negative effects on the esp operation period due to the injection of fgd wastewater the relative humidity of flue gas increases under the spray cooling of the desulfurization tower the water condensed into the slurry circulation system of the desulfurization process at the same time this can reduce the water consumption of the fgd process 4 conclusions in this paper from the perspective of theory and engineering practice the zld technology of fgd in coal fired power plants was studied several major conclusions can be summarized by this method 1 under different boiler load conditions the number of droplets captured by flue wall is closely related to the change of atomization cone angle 2 the droplet spray evaporation process can be divided into initial and steady stage in the initial stage mass transfer diffusion and evaporation rate are faster and a large irregular vortex is formed by spraying on flue gas shear entrainment in the steady stage the droplet group is heated to the stable value by the flue gas and all the heat absorbed was used for the evaporation of the droplet group the droplet velocity is consistent with the flue gas velocity and the shape of the flow field vortex tended to be stable 3 for the wastewater droplets the higher the boiler load the higher the flue gas temperature and velocity the higher the vaporization rate of droplets and the better the evaporation effect was observed the change of flue gas velocity has little effect on the maximum complete evaporation time of droplets and the temperature of flue gas played a key role in the evaporation effect 4 after injecting fgd wastewater little changes were found on the characteristics of fly ash the inlet flue gas temperature of esp was higher than 115 no negative effects were found on the downstream process there was no observable ash deposition in the flue duct after continuous operation 5 the zld technology has the advantages of short process configuration simple operation small area and a cost advantage

flue gas and fly ash characteristics after the injection of fgd wastewater were evaluated in order to verify the numerical model and provide guidelines for future commercial applications the experiment which is base on the numerical simulation results and the engineering measured data was performed this paper presents the numerical simulation methods and then compares the engineering results with these simulation results the main goal is to achieve a guideline for the zld evaporation process of fgd wastewater 2 methods in this study 3 two fluid compressed air and wastewater nozzles were uniformly arranged in the vertical section of flue duct in a 330 mw coal fired power plant the nozzles were set in the elevation of 13 8 m the fgd wastewater was pretreated by the chemical precipitation the effluents stored in a buffer tank and then sent to the wastewater dispenser by the spray feed pump the water dispenser distributes the water to the three atomization nozzles an air purifier removes oil and small particles from compressed plant air then the air enters the compressed air dispenser and the compressed air atomization nozzle distributes air by the compressed air distributor three atomizing nozzles can be operated with the same parameters to provide of the uniformity of the atomizing nozzles the power plant provided combustion calculations the heat balance calculations the characteristic parameters temperature drop of flue gas and the influence of fly ash after the injection of fgd wastewater the fgd wastewater flue evaporation process in flue duct is shown in fig 1 ansa and fluent software were used as the tools to simulate the evaporation process of fgd wastewater during the simulation and calculation of atomization droplet evaporation it is assumed that 1 compressed air is a continuous phase and fgd wastewater atomization droplet is a discrete phase both of them at constant temperature 2 ignoring the influence of nozzle nozzle pipe and other components on the flue duct field 3 the mach number of flue gas is low that can be assumed as an incompressible fluid 4 ignoring the heat transfer between the wall of the flue duct and the flue gas and the boundary condition is set to adiabatic 5 when the atomized liquid drops it contacts the wall surface of the flue duct to be captured immediately the droplet stop track is calculated all the mass is converted into a vapor phase instantly and enters the grid connected with the wall surface 6 the liquid drop particles are approximately spherical and ignoring the heat transfer thermal resistance inside the liquid drops and ignoring the fusion and crushing caused by collision between the droplet particles 2 1 physical model the flue duct structure arrangement of atomizing nozzles flue gas distribution in the flue duct between the air preheater and the esp and the droplets distribution after fgd wastewater injected into the flue duct are shown in fig 2 the vertical color column is the velocity of flue gas the flue duct is divided into six parts entrance section lower bend vertical section upper bend special shaped bend and horizontal flue duct ansa software was used to develop a mesh of the geometric model of the flue duct the structure of the flue duct is simple and the structure of the flow field is uniform the total hexahedral mesh has an obvious advantage over the tetrahedral mesh in the speed calculation the total number of grid numbers is about 2 3 million 2 2 mathematical model 2 2 1 continuous phase equations the turbulent flow field of spray evaporation of fgd wastewater can be described by the lagrange and euler method the transient motion of each turbulent pulsating microparticle can be described by lagrangian method when compared with eula method it cannot describe the flow distribution of the whole flow field clearly therefore in the actual numerical simulation the euler coordinate system is used as the tool to solve the turbulent flow in the flue gas phase the governing equations of the main variables e g velocity and temperature required in the process are expressed as the following general equation 15 1 ρ ϕ t div ρ u ϕ div γ ϕ grad ϕ s ϕ s ϕ p where ø is a universal variable which represent u v w t mixing fraction f and enthalpy value h γø is generalized diffusion coefficient sø is gas phase induced generalized source and søp is solid particle induced source the ø 1 eq 1 is a continuity equation the governing equation was calculated using the continuous phase standard k ε turbulence model 16 and the standard wall equation is chosen near the flue duct wall the model is sufficient to describe the steady flow field in this project because it does not involve the intense distortion and rotation of the flow field 2 2 2 discrete phase equations in the process of discrete phase solution the lagrangian particle random orbit model is widely used the model is simple to calculate and it can track and record the moving track and state of particles at the same time the coupling effect of gas phase turbulence pulsation and discrete phase particles was considered 17 the equation of motive particles is shown as follows 2 m p d u p d t f p m p g only the effect of drag is considered 3 f d 18 μ ρ p d p 2 c d re 24 4 r e p ρ d p u p u μ where cd is the resistance coefficient μ is the dynamic viscosity of flue gas ρp is the density of droplets dp is the average diameter of droplets and rep is the reynolds number of particles because the temperature of spray droplets around 300 k is much lower than flue gas around 400k the temperature of flue gas varies with the change of the loads of power plant type of coal and type of boiler the droplets will absorb the heat of flue gas and vaporize it into water vapor after it is injected into the flue duct when the temperature of the droplets is lower than its boiling point the phase transition of the droplets is mainly an evaporation process and the model of droplets evaporation is shown as follows 5 m p t δ t m p t n i a p m w i δ t where the item on the left is the mass of the droplet after phase transition and mp t is the mass before the phase transition ni is the evaporation rate per unit area of the droplet ap is the surface area of the droplet mw i is the molecular weight of the evaporating component and δt is the time step when the temperature of the droplet is higher than its boiling point the phase transition of the droplet is mainly a boiling process and the model of droplet boiling is shown as follows 6 d d p d t 4 k ρ p c p d p 1 0 23 r e d l n 1 c p t t p h f g where cp is specific heat capacity of the gas at constant pressure k is the thermal conductivity of the gas phase and hfg is the latent heat of gasification 2 3 boundary conditions in this paper three different boiler loads were chosen the flue gas from the exit section of the air preheater is selected as the gas phase result it mainly consisted of five components included h2o co2 o2 so2 and n2 the components transport model was used to simulate the composition of the mixture the wastewater droplets at room temperature were chosen as the liquid phase research object the whole process can be considered as an evaporation process the parameters of gas liquid two phase flow field boundary conditions are shown in table 2 the enthalpy value of flue gas at different boiler loads was calculated by eq 7 which determined whether the maximum amount of fgd wastewater can be evaporated by the evaporation method completely without affecting the downstream esp process 7 hg h g α 1 h a hfly where hg is calculated enthalpy of flue gas kj kg h g is theoretical enthalpy of flue gas kj kg h a is theoretical enthalpy of air kj kg hfly is theoretical enthalpy of fly ash kj kg α is excess air coefficient of different unit loads α is 1 38 1 42 and 1 68 respectively at 100 75 and 50 boiler load with the increase of boiler load the enthalpy value of flue gas and fly ash will also increase 3 results and discussion the evaporation effect of droplets is mainly determined by the following parameters flue gas phase temperature and transport characteristics liquid phase temperature and velocity of movement heat and mass transfer efficiency of gas liquid two phases according to the boundary conditions given in table 2 the load of 50 75 and 100 were analyzed the three kinds of gas phase conditions with different flue gas temperature 120 125 128 9 and flue velocity 9 19 m s 1 11 56 m s 1 14 64 m s 1 show that the effects of gas phase conditions on evaporation and flow characteristics of fgd wastewater are presented and are explained by heat and mass transfer theory 3 1 the influence of spray cone angle and boiler load on the droplet group evaporation time under the conditions of 50 75 and 100 boiler loads the fgd wastewater was sprayed into the flue duct with different atomization cone angles the simulated results of the relationship between the maximum evaporation time of the droplet and the atomization cone angles are shown in fig 3 the value of time shows the downward trend with the increase of the boiler load the maximum evaporation time of droplets in 50 75 and 100 boiler load conditions is in the range of 0 56 1 16 s in order to analyze quantitatively the effect of atomization cone angles on the flow characteristics of atomized droplets the ratio number of droplets captured by the flue wall to the total number of droplets is defined as a0 the quantitative analysis results of evaporation and flow characteristics of fgd wastewater with six different atomization cone angles under the boiler load of 50 75 and 100 respectively is shown in fig 4 the results of droplet number fraction captured on the wall of single flue under six different atomization cone angles of 20 35 50 65 80 95 shows that the number of droplets caught on the wall of flue duct initially decreased up to 50 60 and then increased significantly with the increase of the atomization cone angles the change of a0 value is stable when the angle of atomization cone was increased from 20 to 50 and when increased to 65 a0 reaches the minimum in the process of increasing the atomization cone angle from 65 to 95 the value of a0 was increased but when larger than 90 the increasing rate slowed down or decreased the atomization cone angle 65 was chosen as optimum angle in the following research this is an instructive method to determine the optimum cone angle 3 2 the simulated effect of load on evaporation and movement of droplet group the particle trajectory of different boiler load under the atomization cone angle of 65 is shown in fig 5 the maximum evaporation time corresponding to 100 boiler load was the shortest and the 50 boiler load was the longest for complete evaporation of droplets for droplets of the same size the higher the ambient temperature the faster the flue gas the higher the vaporization rate and the better evaporation effect that can be achieved when droplets of the same size among them the change of flue gas velocity has little effect on the maximum complete evaporation time and the larger flue gas velocity makes the trajectory of droplet particles moving under 100 boiler load is the longest compared with that of 50 75 if the flue duct length is insufficient there is the possibility of incomplete evaporation therefore in the flue duct the flue gas temperature plays a leading role in evaporation effect with the increases of boiler load the flue gas temperature increased the temperature difference between the gas and liquid phase increased and also the heat transfer from the gas phase to the droplet group increased so that it increased the evaporation and mass transfer rate of the droplet surface therefore the droplet temperature continued to rise the evaporation time becomes shorter so the residence time of droplets from injecting into the flue duct and evaporating gradually decreased with the increase of flue gas temperature 3 3 vector distribution analysis of droplet evaporation and motion the atomization and evaporation of fgd wastewater in flue duct can be divided into initial and steady stage in the initial stage the liquid droplets at room temperature are used as the distributed heat sink of endothermic evaporation that can fully absorb the exhausted heat of flue gas most of the heat absorbed was used as the heat sources to increase the droplet temperature and at the same time the droplet group velocity in this stage increased continuously under the influence of the flue gas velocity in a very short time the atomized droplets reach to the steady state when the droplet group was heated to a stable value by the flue gas all the heat absorbed by wastewater was used for the evaporation of the droplet group and the droplet velocity was consistent with that of the incoming flue gas the optimum nozzle spray cone angle of 65 flue section velocity vector of flue duct structure under 75 load condition is further analyzed in fig 6 from the distribution of droplet velocity vector the initial stage of spray evaporation shows that the mass transfer diffusion and evaporation rate is faster and a large irregular vortex was formed in the flue gas shear entrainment by spray due to the large volume flow of flue gas inside the flue that rushed into the opposite wall at a faster speed results in a large pressure difference in the upper part of the flue this means that the closer it was to the inside of the flue the larger the vortex that was formed it was also beneficial to the diffusion of local droplets in the nozzle region to other regions 3 4 results of injecting different amount of fgd wastewater under different boiler load conditions the length of flue duct from the nozzle of waste water to the inlet of esp is 34 5 m and the residence time of flue gas in flue duct was always more than 2 s under different loads the total fgd wastewater evaporation characters of the three nozzles under the conditions of different boiler load is shown in fig 7 fig 7 a shows that with the increase of boiler load the increase of flue gas temperature drop can be caused by the increase of fgd wastewater injection this was subsequently due to the increase of boiler load the increase of flue gas temperature and flue gas enthalpy value that was lower than the heat enthalpy value needed for complete evaporation of wastewater fig 7 b shows that the increase of both the boiler load and the quantity of wastewater the time of total evaporation of wastewater will reduce the smaller the amount of wastewater injected less evaporation time was needed this was due to the increase of boiler load and the increase of flue gas volume that will cause the increase of flue gas velocity and the rise of flue gas temperature therefore the heat transfer between flue gas and wastewater will occur more intensely the evaporation time is 0 5 1 2 s as shown in fig 3 it can be seen from 7 c that the inlet flue temperature of the esp was above 115 which was higher than the acid dew point in the flue gas and no corrosion was found in the structure of esp the internal conditions of flue duct after two months of continuous operation is shown in fig 8 after running for this time there was no obvious ash deposition in the bend and horizontal section of flue duct according to the chloride balance calculation of fgd wastewater cl concentration of approximately 20 000 mg l the residuals were incorporated into the fly ash the total amount of the solids evaporated that were incorporated into the precipitated fly ash were less than 0 6 and the content of cl in the total fly ash was about 0 15 according to the code of universal silicates cement the content of cl in the medium is not more than 0 06 the amount of fly ash portland cement mixed with fly ash was between 20 and less than 40 the cl content of fgd wastewater was incorporated into the fly ash and mixed with the portland cement the content of cement cl was within the range of 0 03 0 06 which can meet the code requirements in table 1 the concentration of na is between 15 000 and 20 000 mg l 1 na ions cannot be removed in the precipitation stage the accumulation of na has little influence on the quality of portland cement because there is no restrict limitations on na residuals during the boiler load was 100 2 m3 h of fgd wastewater were sprayed into the flue duct resulting in an absolute dry fly ash of about 50 120 kg h the fly ash was automatically removed by the esp system through the ash hopper into the ash storage system the zld system can be operated in a continuous mode and there are no negative effects on the esp operation period due to the injection of fgd wastewater the relative humidity of flue gas increases under the spray cooling of the desulfurization tower the water condensed into the slurry circulation system of the desulfurization process at the same time this can reduce the water consumption of the fgd process 4 conclusions in this paper from the perspective of theory and engineering practice the zld technology of fgd in coal fired power plants was studied several major conclusions can be summarized by this method 1 under different boiler load conditions the number of droplets captured by flue wall is closely related to the change of atomization cone angle 2 the droplet spray evaporation process can be divided into initial and steady stage in the initial stage mass transfer diffusion and evaporation rate are faster and a large irregular vortex is formed by spraying on flue gas shear entrainment in the steady stage the droplet group is heated to the stable value by the flue gas and all the heat absorbed was used for the evaporation of the droplet group the droplet velocity is consistent with the flue gas velocity and the shape of the flow field vortex tended to be stable 3 for the wastewater droplets the higher the boiler load the higher the flue gas temperature and velocity the higher the vaporization rate of droplets and the better the evaporation effect was observed the change of flue gas velocity has little effect on the maximum complete evaporation time of droplets and the temperature of flue gas played a key role in the evaporation effect 4 after injecting fgd wastewater little changes were found on the characteristics of fly ash the inlet flue gas temperature of esp was higher than 115 no negative effects were found on the downstream process there was no observable ash deposition in the flue duct after continuous operation 5 the zld technology has the advantages of short process configuration simple operation small area and a cost advantage

14484,in this study photo sequencing batch reactors psbr were setup to evaluate the effect of photoperiod i e 24 h illumination and 16 h 8 h light dark cycle on nh4 n removal performance of algae bacteria consortium under long term low light intensity condition it was observed that constant nh4 n removal rate of 60 mg n l d was achieved in both photoperiods at low light intensity li of 1000 lx longer photoperiod favored higher production of biomass the photoperiod of 16 h 8 h light dark cycle condition produced less biomass but exhibited same nitrification rate and slightly higher denitrification efficiency 30 mg l than the reactor that was operated at 24 h illumination the results of this study demonstrated that using algae bacteria consortia could be a sustainable and cost effective method to treat nh4 n loaded wastewater keywords algae bacteria consortium photo sequence batch reactor nitrogen removal photoperiod low light intensity 1 introduction wastewater treatment is commonly accomplished through activated sludge process however the high energy demand and the large production of activated sludge encourage researchers to find more sustainable and cost effective ways to treat wastewater as primarily oxygen releasing photosynthetic organisms microalgae function as aeration devices to replace the artificial aeration during biological wastewater treatment in addition to oxygen microalgae can produce a wide range of valuable metabolites including fats sugars and bioactive compounds 1 to form simpler organic compounds which could easily be metabolized or consumed by heterotrophic bacteria 2 the exchange of inorganic and organic nutrients through photosynthesis and respiration support an advanced algae bacteria interaction performance 3 algae bacteria consortia have been investigated for decades with earlier research conducted on high rate algal ponds open systems typically need shallow liquid level which allows the consortia to capture light and oxygen due to the large amount of wastewater and shallow environment requirement of an open system land demand becomes a limitation for practical applications in addition the construction of the open pond also makes it chemically instable due to evaporation and precipitation of water 4 thus the compact and enclosed system of photo sequencing batch reactor psbr using microalgae bacteria consortia was developed recently in psbr light is essential for algal biomass growth and photosynthesis it influences the production of oxygen and organic matter the change in light intensity li affects the growth of algae biomass 5 6 higher algal biomass production is expected to produce more oxygen whereas condensed algal biomass could block the penetration of photons and induce inefficient light utilization 7 dissolved oxygen do concentration highly affects nitrogen metabolism for instance a study using continuous illumination with li of 3000 lx produced do mass of 0 46 kg m3 d resulting in full nitrification without any noticeable denitrification 8 do range during the nitrification stage was 0 3 2 4 mg l which increased up to the oxygen saturation point after an hour another study explored the potential of alternating light and dark periods with lis of 5000 lx and 7000 lx 9 it was found that do concentration lower than 0 5 mg l during an entire cycle achieved rapid nitrification and removed over 90 total nitrogen and organic carbon the aforementioned studies show the effect of different light conditions on do concentration which subsequently affects nitrification poor effluent quality could limit the application of microalgae bacteria consortia in wastewater treatment biomass harvest process is typically cost effective and could be easily expanded to large volumes currently large scale biomass harvest is performed using expensive methods such as filtration centrifugation gravity sedimentation and micro straining the lab scale immobilization system could be simply used for harvesting and recycling but it is limited by the costly material and low oxygen and nutrient transfer efficiency to obtain a simple sedimentation by gravity bioflocculent algae bacteria biomass was developed bioflocculant produced by algae bacteria consortia in psbr could be settled by gravity to produce clear effluent 8 9 presenting a relatively low cost approach compared to the aforementioned methods previous batch tests explored the effect of initial ammonium and algae biomass concentrations and light conditions on ammonium removal efficiency by algae bacteria consortia during wastewater treatment 10 it was found that at low li of 1000 lx the ammonium nitrogen removal performance of the consortium was similar to that at 9000 lx lower li consumes less energy while the utilization of low li of 1000 lx has not been reported in other studies of psbr therefore 1000 lx was used in the present experiment to observe the effect of low li implementation in psbr the specific objectives of this study were to examine the effect of different photoperiods on the nitrification performance of the consortia and to estimate the low light intensity effect on a prolonged psbr experiment 2 materials and methods 2 1 growth medium and microorganisms bacteria samples were acquired from the activated sludge which was obtained from the west end water pollution control centre in winnipeg algae were a mixture of cyanobacteria and green algae taken from lake devonian in winnipeg return activated sludge ras and enriched algae liquid were added together to 5 l modified bold s basal medium bbm in a continuously mixing tank two ratio of ras algae liquid which were 0 25 1 and 0 5 1 were pre tested with the ratio of 0 5 1 as ras was condensed it blocked light the algal growth was inhibited whereas the ratios of 0 25 1 resulted better algal growth therefore ras algae ratio of 0 25 1 was used in the presented research growth medium was made to simulate the diluted rejected wastewater wastewater obtained after sludge treatment the tank was set in an incubator at 25 c and illuminated by led strips with the li of 4000 lx to see the effect of high ammonia content 800 mg n l of ammonium chloride was used as nitrogen source for consortium cultivation in the preliminary batch tests ammonium nitrogen concentration was reduced one month before running the psbr to 200 mg n l to compensate for the initial nh4 n loading 150 mg n l the other components used in the wastewater treatment are cacl2 25 mg l nacl 25 mg l mgso4 75 mg l

following solutions 14 1 g l mncl2 4h2o 2 3 g l cuso4 5h2o 2 5 g l co no3 2 6h2o 0 8 g l and na2moo4 2h2o 1 9 g l 11 no additional organic carbon was loaded into the reactors the ph was maintained at 7 5 by adding sodium bicarbonate biomass cultivation lasted for 8 months prior to inoculation in the reactor the cultivation reactor was aerated only during the first month and the medium was renewed by replacing half of the medium containing biomass every two weeks 2 2 experiment set up and operation prior to inoculation consortium culture was centrifuged at 3600 rpm for 10 min washed twice with di water and re suspended in artificial wastewater ammonium nitrogen with a concentration of 140 30 mg l was the only nitrogen source in artificial wastewater same li of 1000 200 lx was used for all

milwaukee instruments inc us light cycle of 16 h 8 h l d and 24 h continuous illumination were separately tested at different stages reactors were cycled once a day which had four stages include filling reaction settling and decanting the filling and decanting took 0 25 h each reaction period was 22 5 h a cycle and settling period was 1 h hydraulic retention time hrt was maintained at two days solid retention time srt was not controlled but monitored and it was in the range of 8 15 days the experiments were carried out in a 20 cm photo sequencing batch reactor psbr at room temperature for 280 days it should be noted that no sterilization step was performed in the whole experiment since it is economically unfeasible for the real world application 2 3 sampling and analytical methods samples were taken from the effluent regularly for reaction cycle tests samples were taken from the reactor every 2 4 h to determine nh4 n no2 n no3 n and toc content 15 ml of sample taken from each reactor were filtered through 0 45 μm hydrophilic filter paper and stored at 4 c each sample was diluted as needed the physical parameters of the aforementioned nitrogen species were determined using

growth at different photoperiods photoperiods of 24 h illumination and 16 h 8 h l d were applied alternately the first 3 weeks phase 1 was the adaptation phase with 16 h 8 h l d photoperiod phase 2 ran from day 23 to day 120 with 24 h illumination phase 3 included 16 h 8 h shifted light phase 4 began from day 215 and included 24 h continuous illumination biomass growth was predicted by total suspended solids tss content in the reactors with time fig 1 tss content decreased in phase 1 and started to increase after the photoperiod shift to 24 h illumination biomass reached 0 8 gtss l at the end of phase 2 decreased lighting period in phase 3 reduced the biomass to 0 57 gtss l from day 120 to day 139 but the stable level of 0 8 gtss l was achieved after 2 months in phase 4 after a lag phase biomass increased to 1 1 gtss l by the end of the experiment 280 days solid retention time srt ranged between 5 and 13 days most of the biomass was settled within 20 min and the sludge volume index svi was measured as 109 ml mg 3 2 bacteria species in the reactor since the interaction between algae and bacteria is very complex 3 it is essential to identify the activity of nitrogen removal bacteria in the consortia system a biomass sample taken at day 120 after the stabilization of the performance was sequenced using 16s v4 for composition analysis of bacteria community table 1 in the reactor the concentration of both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria is presented it was found that proteobacteria 34 7 bacteroidetes 22 and firmicutes 9 41 were the three dominant bacteria phyla other than that op3 7 5 cyanobacteria 5 3 chloroflexi 3 6 acidobacteria 3 4 and planctomycetes 2 3 were also observed in the reactor chlorophyta 4 6 as green algae was also detected in the biomass bacterioidetes and firmicutes are the dominant bacterial divisions present in the human gut 12 13 and many of these are obligate anaerobes proteobacteria is considered the most prominent phylum in wastewater treatment plants 14 including bacteria involved in nitrogen removal such as ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob and denitrifiers under the phylum proteobacteria nitrosomonadaceae is the most abundant bacteria present in the reactor which is the only reported bacteria under this family this result table 1 explained the absence of nitrate in the effluent of psbr the bacteria associated with the anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox process are affiliated with the phylum planctomycetes 15 and most of the identified plactomycetes were present on aggregates 16 besides phylum chloroflexi often exists during the anammox process 17 they survive by intake of organic substrates such as soluble microbial products and extracellular polymeric substances that are derived from anammox bacteria and aobs 18 19 furthermore chloroflexi reportedly play significant functions in microbial aggregates and granulation 17 20 since they are mostly filamentous 3 3 do concentration in different phases do was rapidly consumed over the course of the filling stage until it reached a stable value between 0 4 and 0 7 mg l for the remaining part of the cycle do was kept constant within that range until additional wastewater was fed to the reactor the low concentration of do could create both aerobic and anoxic region in the reactors 9 do value of 0 4 mg l was recorded on day 90 in phase 2 however in phase 3 day 167 the do concentration was 0 6 0 7 mg l in the lighting phase which was comparable to phase 2 and decreased to 0 4 0 5 mg l during the dark phase the higher do in phase 3 is potentially a consequence of higher biomass concentration however do value did not increase with the increase in lighting time and biomass in phase 4 the do results varied between 0 6 and 0 9 mg l this is due to self shading caused by higher biomass density that blocks the light and inhibits photosynthesis 21 3 4 effect of nitrification inhibitor on consortium performance to estimate the nitrogen assimilation by algae and free ammonia fa volatilization nitrification inhibitor was dosed during the filling stage at the end of the experiment each cycle removed 8 mg n l via biomass uptake and volatilization fig 2 since the biomass quantity reached the highest amount of 1 1 gtss l at the end of the experiment the nitrogen assimilation and volatilization did not exceed 8 mg l during any other phase the inhibition of nitrification activity increased the do content in the liquid bulk which limited the denitrification process and maintained the concentration of n no3 the suppression of denitrification resulted in the increase in toc but it stopped after 8 h the organic matter produced in the reactor could be utilized by the presence of other heterotrophic bacteria since the higher do content in the reactor could restore them 3 5 nitrogen removal performance of psbr under different photoperiods the sbrs were run for 280 days two types of photoperiod were tested interchangeably phases 1 and 3 were operated in 16 h 8 h light to dark ld mode whereas phases 2 and 4 were operated at 24 h continuous illumination 3 5 1 nitrogen removal performance under the 16 h 8 h photoperiod phase 1 the nh4 n removal efficiency on the first day was 117 mg n l d which was better than the previously obtained value 108 3 6 mg n l d in a different study 10 however after 4 weeks of cultivation in sbr the value decreased to 43 mg n l d at this point the biomass was washed out and reduced to 0 3 gtss l from its initial value of 0 6 gtss l the decrease in nitrogen removal efficiency could be due to the presence of less amount of biomass additionally the concentration of no2 n in effluent increased gradually to 47 mg n l while the concentration of no3 n remained below 10 mg n l to ensure the proper functioning of reactors biomass in the effluent was settled and recirculated after 10 days fig 3 3 5 2 nitrogen removal performance under continuous illumination phase 2 in phase 2 the photoperiod was changed to 24 h illumination that decreased the nh4 n removal efficiency to 30 mg n l d during the first week however a stable efficiency of 62 3 mg n l d was achieved after 4 weeks moreover the biomass also increased to 0 76 gtss l the higher biomass quantity did not lead to a higher nh4 n removal efficiency similar results were achieved from previous batch tests 10 the no2 n concentration in the effluent remained steady around 60 mg n l while the no3 n increased to 55 mg n l at day 56 and gradually decreased to 15 mg n l at the end of this phase indicating nob inhibition reaction cycle profile of inorganic nitrogen and toc were also monitored through the kinetic test for a reaction cycle for better understanding of the nitrogen removal process the kinetic test was conducted in each phase since the experiment was duplicated each kinetic test only conducted once the mean value of the results was used the equation used to calculate the removal rate as follows use nh4 as an example d n h 4 d t n h 4 t 1 n h 4 t 2 t 1 t 2 for better understanding of the nitrogen removal process fig 4 b shows the data collected in a cycle at day 90 during the course of this cycle nh4 n concentration decreased from 71 7 to 5 1 mg n l with an overall rate of 2 68 mg n l h however no2 n increased steadily to 58 6 mg n l and no3 n remained at a concentration lower than 14 mg l toc remained stable around 41 1 1 5 mg l during the cycle 3 5 3 nitrogen removal performance under the 16 h 8 h photoperiod phase 3 in phase 3 photoperiod was reverted to 16 8 l d within the dark phase nh4 n removal efficiency was 57 9 1 9 mg n l fig 5 a which was similar to phase 2 the biomass was stabilized after a month in this period and remained around 0 78 0 01 gtss l concentration of no2 n was 51 4 1 7 mg n l while the no3 n concentration dropped below the detection limit of 0 5 mg n l however a reduction in the salt concentration in wastewater from 0 56 to 0 24 was observed after two months under the same light condition the lower salinity wastewater was loaded to the reactors for a month during this course nh4 n removal efficiency decreased to 33 mg n l d at first and increased thereafter after stabilization almost 100 of nh4 n was removed this could be due to the low concentration of salts that stimulated aob growth 22 the no2 n concentration dropped below the detection limit within 2 weeks while no3 n increased to 70 mg n l 33 ye et al 2009 reported that nob can completely oxide no2 n to no3 n without additional salinity while the increase in salinity led to inhibition of nob and partial nitrification moreover adjusting the wastewater salinity back to 0 56 did not increase no2 n concentration within two weeks the reason could be a change in microbial community due to the low salinity 22 furthermore the growth of nob group is enhanced in low salinity condition during the phase 3 cycles dark phase started at 10 pm and ended at 6 a m which indicated 7 5 15 5 hours of the cycle the data in fig 5b were collected on day 167 removal of nh4 n took place throughout the cycle but the rate was evidently slower during the dark phase compared to light phase this result could be due to the nitrogen uptake by algae during the dark phase when the algae grow heterotrophically according to perez garcia et al 23 nitrogen removal by chlorella vulgaris was doubled in heterotrophic condition compared to that achieved in autotrophic condition the removal efficiency was 1 71 mg n l h during the dark phase during the first lighting phase removal efficiency was 3 3 mg n l h which was higher than the rate of 24 hour continuous illumination however that value decreased to 2 05 mg n l h at the end of lighting phase no2 n progressively increased but at a slower rate than phase 2 similar to the nitrification efficiency denitrification rate was reduced in the dark phase compared to light phase 6 8 mg n l of inorganic nitrogen was removed during the 8 hour dark period the first 7 5 h and the last 8 5 h removed 22 and 9 3 mg n l of inorganic nitrogen respectively no3 n concentration was below the detection limit indicating that rapid nitrification was achieved in this photoperiod mode the lower toc concentration of phase 3 could be the result of shorter lighting period 3 5 4 nitrogen removal performance under continuous illumination phase 4 the salinity was recovered to 0 56 on day 208 after 2 weeks the photoperiod was changed to continuous illumination the initial purpose of changing illumination back to 24 h was to verify if rapid nitrification could be achieved in this photoperiod as well however rapid nitrification was not observed after changing the salinity at the end of phase 3 which is due to the failure in recovering microbial community moreover biomass increased in this phase but did not improve the nitrification efficiency the nh4 n removal efficiency was 58 7 1 4 mg n l d no3 n in the effluent was 64 6 1 2 mg n l and no2 n was under the detection limit fig 6 the reaction cycle test was conducted on day 262 nh4 n decreased steadily at a removal rate of 2 37 mg n h no3 n increased constantly from 36 7 mg n l to 65 7 mg n l and toc decreased from 65 4 to 42 2 mg l even though rapid nitrification did not occur denitrification was observed in this phase 4 discussion 4 1 nitrogen metabolism with different photoperiods the percentage of the nitrogen profile for three reaction cycle tests is summarized in table 2 the fa volatilization and biomass uptake of nitrogen was estimated by adding nitrification inhibitor at the end of the experiment which maximized the nh4 n at 8 mg n l in a cycle thus nh4 n was primarily removed by nitrification and nitritation in phase 3 the existence of dark phase in a cycle limited the photosynthesis process and produced less oxygen within this phase nitrate became the unique product due to less do in the reactor 9 24 even though the phase 3 cycle was characterized by lower organic carbon in the liquid bulk compared to phases 2 and 4 table 3 anova showed no significant difference for nitrogen removal p 0 05 compared to that of the 24 hour illumination photoperiod due to the low organic carbon in the reactor denitrification took place at a low efficiency 9 nh4 n was entirely converted into no3 in phase 4 which could be the result of microbial community change during the load of low salinity wastewater of 0 24 22 another reason is due to the increase in do concentration from 0 6 to 0 9 mg l induced by the longer lighting period and higher biomass for the removal of nh4 n table 3 similar to previous batch test results the lower biomass resulted in higher efficiency with the biomass of 0 583 g l the removal rate was significantly higher anova p 0 03 than that of phase 2 this result confirmed that higher biomass only increased shading and is unnecessary for a high removal rate especially when the photosynthetic organisms are involved before phase 4 the accumulation of no2 indicated the inhibition of nob activity according to villaverde et al 25 fa higher than 1 5 mg l inhibits nob the maximum fa concentration of 1 84 mg n l was produced during the start up days while it decreased below 1 5 mg l after one week it was also found that free nitrous acid fna higher than 0 11 mg l inhibited nob according to the eq 1 fna in the reactor ranged from 0 012 to 0 015 mg l before phase 4 which was higher than the reported concentration of 0 011 mg l that inhibited nob 26 1 h n o 2 m g l 46 14 n o 2 n m g l k a 10 p h 27 moreover the condition of low do 28 and short srt 9 29 were also reported to favor nitritation the combination of alternating high no2 concentrations and low do could be the reason for no2 accumulation however the decrease in salinity to 0 24 promoted nob activity consequently no2 concentration decreased below the detection limit for the remaining period thereby restricting the inhibition of fna on nob 4 2 effect of photoperiod on biomass and toc concentration due to the higher biomass achieved in phase 4 the toc content was 43 higher than that of phase 2 table 3 however higher biomass in phase 3 did not stimulate toc production it could be due to less photosynthesis activity during the dark phase and the higher heterotrophic growth of some algae species during the dark phase that could uptake the organic matter in the reactor 23 in addition higher toc produced in phase 4 did not achieve effective denitrification this result is in accordance to an ex situ denitrification test carried by wang et al 9 it was reported that without additional biodegradable organic carbon the denitrification could not be accomplished in a sample of centrate containing 209 mg l biochemical oxygen demand bod do is essential for nitrification without photoinhibition it is reasonable to expect that high algal density result in higher oxygen production which leads to better nitrification efficiency in the current experiment biomass increased in phases 2 and 4 and was stable in phase 3 with less lighting period however as shown in table 2 the presence of higher biomass did not positively affect nitrification which showed similar rates to those previously reported 21 the reason could be due to the self shading formed by the increased biomass biomass in phase 3 remained stable and did not lead to reduced nitrification or denitrification rate the lower biomass production in phase 3 was accomplished with the srt around 10 days indicating less bio waste generation compared to 24 hour illumination 4 3 settleability of the biomass the cost due to biomass harvesting influences the feasibility of consortia application it is a challenge to capture the dispersedly suspended microalgae for a large scale treatment the harvesting process typically involves physical chemical or biological methods none of the available industrial methods for harvesting microalgae is cost effective 3 in this study floc size in the consortium ranged from 500 to 3000 μm the bioflocculant algae bacteria biomass was produced as the interactions of algae with other microorganisms favored the formation of bioflocculant consortia 30 extracellular polymeric substance eps excreted by bacteria bioflocculant enhances the aggregation of microalgae and bacteria 31 32 microorganism species also contribute to biomass flocculation the result of 16srna demonstrates that the bacteria community composition of the consortium was very abundant the presence of phyla chloroflexi and planctomycetes contributed to the formation of microbial aggregates 16 17 20 filamentous microorganisms were also observed in the cultivation reactors by microscope which could be represented by some species of algae or chloroflexi that typically mediate with other organisms and cause aggregation formation 30 the consortium achieved in this experiment resulted in an effluent with low tss concentration average 33 3 4 mg l indicating a good settleability 5 conclusion the current study used psbrs which operated at low light intensity of 1000 lx hrt of 2 days and srt ranging from 5 to 13 days to treat wastewater loaded with 130 mg n l a daily ammonium removal rate of 60 mg n l d was achieved in both psbrs photoperiods of 24 hour continuous illumination and 16 h 8 h l d longer lighting period favored the growth of biomass which resulted in 43 more toc production in the same photoperiod however the higher biomass resulted in a lower nitrification rate per unit biomass in addition the existing toc was not sufficient to achieve effective denitrification rates the photoperiod of 16 h 8 h produced less biomass but exhibited same ammonia removal efficiency and slightly higher denitrification efficiency this study demonstrates that the use of algae bacteria consortia requires less energy to treat nh4 n loaded wastewater and this method should be further optimized to make it more sustainable and cost effective acknowledgement natural sciences and engineering research council of canada rgpin 2014 05510 financially supported this work 
14484,in this study photo sequencing batch reactors psbr were setup to evaluate the effect of photoperiod i e 24 h illumination and 16 h 8 h light dark cycle on nh4 n removal performance of algae bacteria consortium under long term low light intensity condition it was observed that constant nh4 n removal rate of 60 mg n l d was achieved in both photoperiods at low light intensity li of 1000 lx longer photoperiod favored higher production of biomass the photoperiod of 16 h 8 h light dark cycle condition produced less biomass but exhibited same nitrification rate and slightly higher denitrification efficiency 30 mg l than the reactor that was operated at 24 h illumination the results of this study demonstrated that using algae bacteria consortia could be a sustainable and cost effective method to treat nh4 n loaded wastewater keywords algae bacteria consortium photo sequence batch reactor nitrogen removal photoperiod low light intensity 1 introduction wastewater treatment is commonly accomplished through activated sludge process however the high energy demand and the large production of activated sludge encourage researchers to find more sustainable and cost effective ways to treat wastewater as primarily oxygen releasing photosynthetic organisms microalgae function as aeration devices to replace the artificial aeration during biological wastewater treatment in addition to oxygen microalgae can produce a wide range of valuable metabolites including fats sugars and bioactive compounds 1 to form simpler organic compounds which could easily be metabolized or consumed by heterotrophic bacteria 2 the exchange of inorganic and organic nutrients through photosynthesis and respiration support an advanced algae bacteria interaction performance 3 algae bacteria consortia have been investigated for decades with earlier research conducted on high rate algal ponds open systems typically need shallow liquid level which allows the consortia to capture light and oxygen due to the large amount of wastewater and shallow environment requirement of an open system land demand becomes a limitation for practical applications in addition the construction of the open pond also makes it chemically instable due to evaporation and precipitation of water 4 thus the compact and enclosed system of photo sequencing batch reactor psbr using microalgae bacteria consortia was developed recently in psbr light is essential for algal biomass growth and photosynthesis it influences the production of oxygen and organic matter the change in light intensity li affects the growth of algae biomass 5 6 higher algal biomass production is expected to produce more oxygen whereas condensed algal biomass could block the penetration of photons and induce inefficient light utilization 7 dissolved oxygen do concentration highly affects nitrogen metabolism for instance a study using continuous illumination with li of 3000 lx produced do mass of 0 46 kg m3 d resulting in full nitrification without any noticeable denitrification 8 do range during the nitrification stage was 0 3 2 4 mg l which increased up to the oxygen saturation point after an hour another study explored the potential of alternating light and dark periods with lis of 5000 lx and 7000 lx 9 it was found that do concentration lower than 0 5 mg l during an entire cycle achieved rapid nitrification and removed over 90 total nitrogen and organic carbon the aforementioned studies show the effect of different light conditions on do concentration which subsequently affects nitrification poor effluent quality could limit the application of microalgae bacteria consortia in wastewater treatment biomass harvest process is typically cost effective and could be easily expanded to large volumes currently large scale biomass harvest is performed using expensive methods such as filtration centrifugation gravity sedimentation and micro straining the lab scale immobilization system could be simply used for harvesting and recycling but it is limited by the costly material and low oxygen and nutrient transfer efficiency to obtain a simple sedimentation by gravity bioflocculent algae bacteria biomass was developed bioflocculant produced by algae bacteria consortia in psbr could be settled by gravity to produce clear effluent 8 9 presenting a relatively low cost approach compared to the aforementioned methods previous batch tests explored the effect of initial ammonium and algae biomass concentrations and light conditions on ammonium removal efficiency by algae bacteria consortia during wastewater treatment 10 it was found that at low li of 1000 lx the ammonium nitrogen removal performance of the consortium was similar to that at 9000 lx lower li consumes less energy while the utilization of low li of 1000 lx has not been reported in other studies of psbr therefore 1000 lx was used in the present experiment to observe the effect of low li implementation in psbr the specific objectives of this study were to examine the effect of different photoperiods on the nitrification performance of the consortia and to estimate the low light intensity effect on a prolonged psbr experiment 2 materials and methods 2 1 growth medium and microorganisms bacteria samples were acquired from the activated sludge which was obtained from the west end water pollution control centre in winnipeg algae were a mixture of cyanobacteria and green algae taken from lake devonian in winnipeg return activated sludge ras and enriched algae liquid were added together to 5 l modified bold s basal medium bbm in a continuously mixing tank two ratio of ras algae liquid which were 0 25 1 and 0 5 1 were pre tested with the ratio of 0 5 1 as ras was condensed it blocked light the algal growth was inhibited whereas the ratios of 0 25 1 resulted better algal growth therefore ras algae ratio of 0 25 1 was used in the presented research growth medium was made to simulate the diluted rejected wastewater wastewater obtained after sludge treatment the tank was set in an incubator at 25 c and illuminated by led strips with the li of 4000 lx to see the effect of high ammonia content 800 mg n l of ammonium chloride was used as nitrogen source for consortium cultivation in the preliminary batch tests ammonium nitrogen concentration was reduced one month before running the psbr to 200 mg n l to compensate for the initial nh4 n loading 150 mg n l the other components used in the wastewater treatment are cacl2 25 mg l nacl 25 mg l mgso4 75 mg l

7 5 by adding sodium bicarbonate biomass cultivation lasted for 8 months prior to inoculation in the reactor the cultivation reactor was aerated only during the first month and the medium was renewed by replacing half of the medium containing biomass every two weeks 2 2 experiment set up and operation prior to inoculation consortium culture was centrifuged at 3600 rpm for 10 min washed twice with di water and re suspended in artificial wastewater ammonium nitrogen with a concentration of 140 30 mg l was the only nitrogen source in artificial wastewater same li of 1000 200 lx was used for all

milwaukee instruments inc us light cycle of 16 h 8 h l d and 24 h continuous illumination were separately tested at different stages reactors were cycled once a day which had four stages include filling reaction settling and decanting the filling and decanting took 0 25 h each reaction period was 22 5 h a cycle and settling period was 1 h hydraulic retention time hrt was maintained at two days solid retention time srt was not controlled but monitored and it was in the range of 8 15 days the experiments were carried out in a 20 cm photo sequencing batch reactor psbr at room temperature for 280 days it should be noted that no sterilization step was performed in the whole experiment since it is economically unfeasible for the real world application 2 3 sampling and analytical methods samples were taken from the effluent regularly for reaction cycle tests samples were taken from the reactor every 2 4 h to determine nh4 n no2 n no3 n and toc content 15 ml of sample taken from each reactor were filtered through 0 45 μm hydrophilic filter paper and stored at 4 c each sample was diluted as needed the physical parameters of the aforementioned nitrogen species were determined using

growth at different photoperiods photoperiods of 24 h illumination and 16 h 8 h l d were applied alternately the first 3 weeks phase 1 was the adaptation phase with 16 h 8 h l d photoperiod phase 2 ran from day 23 to day 120 with 24 h illumination phase 3 included 16 h 8 h shifted light phase 4 began from day 215 and included 24 h continuous illumination biomass growth was predicted by total suspended solids tss content in the reactors with time fig 1 tss content decreased in phase 1 and started to increase after the photoperiod shift to 24 h illumination biomass reached 0 8 gtss l at the end of phase 2 decreased lighting period in phase 3 reduced the biomass to 0 57 gtss l from day 120 to day 139 but the stable level of 0 8 gtss l was achieved after 2 months in phase 4 after a lag phase biomass increased to 1 1 gtss l by the end of the experiment 280 days solid retention time srt ranged between 5 and 13 days most of the biomass was settled within 20 min and the sludge volume index svi was measured as 109 ml mg 3 2 bacteria species in the reactor since the interaction between algae and bacteria is very complex 3 it is essential to identify the activity of nitrogen removal bacteria in the consortia system a biomass sample taken at day 120 after the stabilization of the performance was sequenced using 16s v4 for composition analysis of bacteria community table 1 in the reactor the concentration of both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria is presented it was found that proteobacteria 34 7 bacteroidetes 22 and firmicutes 9 41 were the three dominant bacteria phyla other than that op3 7 5 cyanobacteria 5 3 chloroflexi 3 6 acidobacteria 3 4 and planctomycetes 2 3 were also observed in the reactor chlorophyta 4 6 as green algae was also detected in the biomass bacterioidetes and firmicutes are the dominant bacterial divisions present in the human gut 12 13 and many of these are obligate anaerobes proteobacteria is considered the most prominent phylum in wastewater treatment plants 14 including bacteria involved in nitrogen removal such as ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob and denitrifiers under the phylum proteobacteria nitrosomonadaceae is the most abundant bacteria present in the reactor which is the only reported bacteria under this family this result table 1 explained the absence of nitrate in the effluent of psbr the bacteria associated with the anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox process are affiliated with the phylum planctomycetes 15 and most of the identified plactomycetes were present on aggregates 16 besides phylum chloroflexi often exists during the anammox process 17 they survive by intake of organic substrates such as soluble microbial products and extracellular polymeric substances that are derived from anammox bacteria and aobs 18 19 furthermore chloroflexi reportedly play significant functions in microbial aggregates and granulation 17 20 since they are mostly filamentous 3 3 do concentration in different phases do was rapidly consumed over the course of the filling stage until it reached a stable value between 0 4 and 0 7 mg l for the remaining part of the cycle do was kept constant within that range until additional wastewater was fed to the reactor the low concentration of do could create both aerobic and anoxic region in the reactors 9 do value of 0 4 mg l was recorded on day 90 in phase 2 however in phase 3 day 167 the do concentration was 0 6 0 7 mg l in the lighting phase which was comparable to phase 2 and decreased to 0 4 0 5 mg l during the dark phase the higher do in phase 3 is potentially a consequence of higher biomass concentration however do value did not increase with the increase in lighting time and biomass in phase 4 the do results varied between 0 6 and 0 9 mg l this is due to self shading caused by higher biomass density that blocks the light and inhibits photosynthesis 21 3 4 effect of nitrification inhibitor on consortium performance to estimate the nitrogen assimilation by algae and free ammonia fa volatilization nitrification inhibitor was dosed during the filling stage at the end of the experiment each cycle removed 8 mg n l via biomass uptake and volatilization fig 2 since the biomass quantity reached the highest amount of 1 1 gtss l at the end of the experiment the nitrogen assimilation and volatilization did not exceed 8 mg l during any other phase the inhibition of nitrification activity increased the do content in the liquid bulk which limited the denitrification process and maintained the concentration of n no3 the suppression of denitrification resulted in the increase in toc but it stopped after 8 h the organic matter produced in the reactor could be utilized by the presence of other heterotrophic bacteria since the higher do content in the reactor could restore them 3 5 nitrogen removal performance of psbr under different photoperiods the sbrs were run for 280 days two types of photoperiod were tested interchangeably phases 1 and 3 were operated in 16 h 8 h light to dark ld mode whereas phases 2 and 4 were operated at 24 h continuous illumination 3 5 1 nitrogen removal performance under the 16 h 8 h photoperiod phase 1 the nh4 n removal efficiency on the first day was 117 mg n l d which was better than the previously obtained value 108 3 6 mg n l d in a different study 10 however after 4 weeks of cultivation in sbr the value decreased to 43 mg n l d at this point the biomass was washed out and reduced to 0 3 gtss l from its initial value of 0 6 gtss l the decrease in nitrogen removal efficiency could be due to the presence of less amount of biomass additionally the concentration of no2 n in effluent increased gradually to 47 mg n l while the concentration of no3 n remained below 10 mg n l to ensure the proper functioning of reactors biomass in the effluent was settled and recirculated after 10 days fig 3 3 5 2 nitrogen removal performance under continuous illumination phase 2 in phase 2 the photoperiod was changed to 24 h illumination that decreased the nh4 n removal efficiency to 30 mg n l d during the first week however a stable efficiency of 62 3 mg n l d was achieved after 4 weeks moreover the biomass also increased to 0 76 gtss l the higher biomass quantity did not lead to a higher nh4 n removal efficiency similar results were achieved from previous batch tests 10 the no2 n concentration in the effluent remained steady around 60 mg n l while the no3 n increased to 55 mg n l at day 56 and gradually decreased to 15 mg n l at the end of this phase indicating nob inhibition reaction cycle profile of inorganic nitrogen and toc were also monitored through the kinetic test for a reaction cycle for better understanding of the nitrogen removal process the kinetic test was conducted in each phase since the experiment was duplicated each kinetic test only conducted once the mean value of the results was used the equation used to calculate the removal rate as follows use nh4 as an example d n h 4 d t n h 4 t 1 n h 4 t 2 t 1 t 2 for better understanding of the nitrogen removal process fig 4 b shows the data collected in a cycle at day 90 during the course of this cycle nh4 n concentration decreased from 71 7 to 5 1 mg n l with an overall rate of 2 68 mg n l h however no2 n increased steadily to 58 6 mg n l and no3 n remained at a concentration lower than 14 mg l toc remained stable around 41 1 1 5 mg l during the cycle 3 5 3 nitrogen removal performance under the 16 h 8 h photoperiod phase 3 in phase 3 photoperiod was reverted to 16 8 l d within the dark phase nh4 n removal efficiency was 57 9 1 9 mg n l fig 5 a which was similar to phase 2 the biomass was stabilized after a month in this period and remained around 0 78 0 01 gtss l concentration of no2 n was 51 4 1 7 mg n l while the no3 n concentration dropped below the detection limit of 0 5 mg n l however a reduction in the salt concentration in wastewater from 0 56 to 0 24 was observed after two months under the same light condition the lower salinity wastewater was loaded to the reactors for a month during this course nh4 n removal efficiency decreased to 33 mg n l d at first and increased thereafter after stabilization almost 100 of nh4 n was removed this could be due to the low concentration of salts that stimulated aob growth 22 the no2 n concentration dropped below the detection limit within 2 weeks while no3 n increased to 70 mg n l 33 ye et al 2009 reported that nob can completely oxide no2 n to no3 n without additional salinity while the increase in salinity led to inhibition of nob and partial nitrification moreover adjusting the wastewater salinity back to 0 56 did not increase no2 n concentration within two weeks the reason could be a change in microbial community due to the low salinity 22 furthermore the growth of nob group is enhanced in low salinity condition during the phase 3 cycles dark phase started at 10 pm and ended at 6 a m which indicated 7 5 15 5 hours of the cycle the data in fig 5b were collected on day 167 removal of nh4 n took place throughout the cycle but the rate was evidently slower during the dark

progressively increased but at a slower rate than phase 2 similar to the nitrification efficiency denitrification rate was reduced in the dark phase compared to light phase 6 8 mg n l of inorganic nitrogen was removed during the 8 hour dark period the first 7 5 h and the last 8 5 h removed 22 and 9 3 mg n l of inorganic nitrogen respectively no3 n concentration was below the detection limit indicating that rapid nitrification was achieved in this photoperiod mode the lower toc concentration of phase 3 could be the result of shorter lighting period 3 5 4 nitrogen removal performance under continuous illumination phase 4 the salinity was recovered to 0 56 on day 208 after 2 weeks the photoperiod was changed to continuous illumination the initial purpose of changing illumination back to 24 h was to verify if rapid nitrification could be achieved in this photoperiod as well however rapid nitrification was not observed after changing the salinity at the end of phase 3 which is due to the failure in recovering microbial community moreover biomass increased in this phase but did not improve the nitrification efficiency the nh4 n removal efficiency was 58 7 1 4 mg n l d no3 n in the effluent was 64 6 1 2 mg n l and no2 n was under the detection limit fig 6 the reaction cycle test was conducted on day 262 nh4 n decreased steadily at a removal rate of 2 37 mg n h no3 n increased constantly from 36 7 mg n l to 65 7 mg n l and toc decreased from 65 4 to 42 2 mg l even though rapid nitrification did not occur denitrification was observed in this phase 4 discussion 4 1 nitrogen

leads to better nitrification efficiency in the current experiment biomass increased in phases 2 and 4 and was stable in phase 3 with less lighting period however as shown in table 2 the presence of higher biomass did not positively affect nitrification which showed similar rates to those previously reported 21 the reason could be due to the self shading formed by the increased biomass biomass in phase 3 remained stable and did not lead to reduced nitrification or denitrification rate the lower biomass production in phase 3 was accomplished with the srt around 10 days indicating less bio waste generation compared to 24 hour illumination 4 3 settleability of the biomass the cost due to biomass harvesting influences the feasibility of consortia application it is a challenge to capture the dispersedly suspended microalgae for a large scale treatment the harvesting process typically involves physical chemical or biological methods none of the available industrial methods for harvesting microalgae is cost effective 3 in this study floc size in the consortium ranged from 500 to 3000 μm the bioflocculant algae bacteria biomass was produced as the interactions of algae with other microorganisms favored the formation of bioflocculant consortia 30 extracellular polymeric substance eps excreted by bacteria bioflocculant enhances the aggregation of microalgae and bacteria 31 32 microorganism species also contribute to biomass flocculation the result of 16srna demonstrates that the bacteria community composition of the consortium was very abundant the presence of phyla chloroflexi and planctomycetes contributed to the formation of microbial aggregates 16 17 20 filamentous microorganisms were also observed in the cultivation reactors by microscope which could be represented by some species of algae or chloroflexi that typically mediate with other organisms and cause aggregation formation 30 the consortium achieved in this experiment resulted in an effluent with low tss concentration average 33 3 4 mg l indicating a good settleability 5 conclusion the current study used psbrs which operated at low light intensity of 1000 lx hrt of 2 days and srt ranging from 5 to 13 days to treat wastewater loaded with 130 mg n l a daily ammonium removal rate of 60 mg n l d was achieved in both psbrs photoperiods of 24 hour continuous illumination and 16 h 8 h l d longer lighting period favored the growth of biomass which resulted in 43 more toc production in the same photoperiod however the higher biomass resulted in a lower nitrification rate per unit biomass in addition the existing toc was not sufficient to achieve effective denitrification rates the photoperiod of 16 h 8 h produced less biomass but exhibited same ammonia removal efficiency and slightly higher denitrification efficiency this study demonstrates that the use of algae bacteria consortia requires less energy to treat nh4 n loaded wastewater and this method should be further optimized to make it more sustainable and cost effective acknowledgement natural sciences and engineering research council of canada rgpin 2014 05510 financially supported this work
