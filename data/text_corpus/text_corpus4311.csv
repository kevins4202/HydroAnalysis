investigates this flow configuration focusing on the effects of the cylinders spacing ratio p d 2 8 5 2 and the array orientation with reference to the oncoming flow α 0 30 under a fixed reynolds number 8000 based on the cylinder diameter d the hydrodynamic forces drag and lift on each cylinder were directly measured using piezoelectric load cells together with concurrent flow measurements using particle image velocimetry piv technique to quantitatively visualize the shear layer development vortex formation and interaction process the flow interference among the cylinders which shares some similarities with that of two cylinders arranged in side by side tandem or staggered configuration is further complicated due to the presence of the third cylinder and exhibits many unique features a number of different flow patterns including shear layer reattachment induced separation synchronized or independent vortex shedding etc are identified over the p d α parameter space the

frequencies of each cylinder keywords three cylinder array equilateral triangular arrangement flow interference hydrodynamic force coefficients particle image velocimetry piv 1 introduction the flow around circular cylinders has been extensively studied due to its importance in many practical applications such as offshore structures chimneys and heat exchangers in many cases the cylinders are always arranged in groups or arrays e g three or four cylinder arrays see the review by khalifa et al 2012 flow interference among the cylinders in a multi cylinder array may give rise to flow separation reattachment and vortex impingement as well as flow induced vibration fiv han et al 2018 in particular a three cylinder array arranged in equilateral triangular configuration is widely used in marine and offshore engineering such as tension leg platforms deep draft semi submersibles liang et al 2017 and floating turbines goldschmidt and muskulus 2015 gonçalves et al 2018 as well as other situations where deep water steel catenary and flexible risers are trapped together as bundles to obtain better mechanical properties han et al 2018 the published studies in the literature have revealed that this type of flow is complex and is determined by three basic parameters i the cylinder to cylinder spacing which is typically expressed as the pitch ratio p d where p is the cylinders centre to centre pitch or distance and d is the cylinder diameter ii the incidence angle of the array relative to the oncoming flow α and iii reynolds number re ρ u d μ where ρ is the density of fluid u is the free stream velocity and μ is the dynamic viscosity of fluid table 1 summaries a list of published studies experimental and numerical on this flow configuration among others which investigated the effects of varying the three parameters p d α and re as can be inferred from table 1 except for kubo et al 1995 gonçalves et al 2018 and ma et al 2019 2020 that studied fiv of the cylinder array most of the previous experimental studies considered the case of rigid type of cylinders under fixed mounting condition sayers 1987 measured the force coefficients and vortex shedding frequencies through pressure measurements around the circumference of one of the three cylinders since only one cylinder was instrumented with pressure transducers the cylinder array was rotated from 0 to 45 in steps of 7 5 to obtain the force coefficients on the other two cylinders and hence details of the interference effect among the three cylinders were unclear the effects of spacing ratio and incidence angle on the flow interference among the three cylinders were examined by lam and cheung 1988 using dye injection flow visualization it was concluded that the bi stable flow pattern occurred at p d 1 27 2 29 depends on the starting conditions based on pressure measurements around the circumference of each cylinder tatsuno et al 1998 showed that the effects of flow interference among the three cylinders are severe when the spacing is small when two cylinders arranged side by side are upstream of or behind the third one the flow patterns are not symmetrical with respect to the oncoming flow direction correspondingly the drag or lift coefficients of the two cylinders are not always equal to each other gu and sun 2001 tried to categorize the different types of flow interference among the cylinders with reference to pitch ratio four different levels of interference were identified s i e small 1 7 p d 2 0 medium p d 2 2 transition 2 5 p d 3 0 and larger p d 4 0 where the small pitch ratio range can be further sub divided into three types i e interference of proximity shear layer reattachment and wake with α varied from 0 to 60 seven steps of flow pattern can be divided pouryoussefi et al 2011 investigated the effects of varying pitch ratio and reynolds number under a fixed incidence angle of α 0 i e one cylinder is located upstream and the other two are located downstream arranged side by side it was found that both the drag coefficients and the vortex shedding frequencies are functions of pitch ratio whereas the mean lift force coefficients of the upstream cylinder are nearly zero located in the wake of the upstream cylinders the downstream cylinders are usually subjected to lower mean drag but higher fluctuating forces bansal and yarusevych 2017 examined the effects of incidence angle over the range 0 α 60 for a fixed pitch ratio p d 1 35 and reynolds number re 2100 they discovered that large scale vortex shedding is observed about 5 d downstream of the cylinder array and the value of strouhal number st when scaled by the projected height of the three cylinders is approximately identical to that of an isolated cylinder of equivalent diameter on the other hand aided by the rapid development of computing power and advance in computational fluid dynamics cfd technique a number of numerical studies have been conducted on this flow configuration over the past decade most of them are 2d simulations at relatively low reynolds numbers re 200 or in the laminar regime for the case of fixed rigid cylinders e g bao et al 2010 yan et al 2016 yang et al 2016 zheng et al 2016 bao et al 2018 sayehvand et al 2018 bao et al 2010 investigated the effects of varying pitch ratio 1 5 p d 5 0 and incident angle α 0 30 and 60 at re 100 using a split fem yan et al 2016 and yang et al 2016 conducted simulations using lbm at re 100 200 together with laser induced fluorescence flow visualization two distinct flow patterns are identified namely steady flow 1 p d 1 2 and 2 5 p d 3 1 and unsteady flow 1 3 p d 2 4 and 3 2 p d 10 using a finite volume method zheng et al 2016 simulated the flow for incidence angles of α 0 and 60 at re 100 and 200 and identified three distinct flow patterns with respect to spacing ratio which are also dependent on re bao et al 2018 further illustrated that the flow patterns and force characteristics of the three cylinder array are the result of combined effects of reynolds number configuration arrangement cylinder spacing and incident angle the flow is classified into three categories with reference to the pitch ratio i biased flow at small spacing p d 1 5 ii disappearance of suppression effects on vortex shedding at medium spacing p d 4 and iii disappearance of mutual effects among the cylinders at large spacing p d 8 sayehvand et al 2018 investigated the heat transfer characteristics due to variation in reynolds number re 80 120 and 200 for a fixed pitch ratio p d 2 and incidence angle α 60 unlike these above mentioned studies that are in laminar regime several researchers numerically investigated this flow configuration in the sub critical regime for instance the 2d simulation by alam and cheng 2011 at re 1000 and the 3d simulation by gao et al 2019 at re 1500 and 3900 it was shown that the three dimensionality of the wake flow becomes stronger with the reynolds number in addition some researchers numerically studied the fluid structure interaction for three equally spaced elastically mounted rigid cylinders undergoing fiv wang et al 2013 considered the effects of typical incidence angles α 0 30 and 60 and reduced velocities 3 u r 12 for a fixed spacing p d 4 0 and reynolds number re 150 han et al 2018 investigated the fiv problem of a three cylinder array at the same pitch ratio p d 4 0 but in the sub critical regime with much higher reynolds numbers re 1000 30 000 corresponding to 1 u r 30 both studies discovered that the vortex shedding frequencies the vibration amplitudes and trajectories significantly rely upon the incidence angle and the reduced velocity moreover han et al 2018 showed that besides the conventional vortex induced vibration viv the wake induced vibration or galloping which is characterized by significant increase in vibration amplitude and decrease in vibration frequency occurs when α 30 several trends can be observed based on the review of relevant literatures firstly all the experimental studies were conducted exclusively in the sub critical regime the same regime as that generally encountered in engineering practice within this regime the flow is basically insensitive to reynolds number but varies significantly with cylinder spacing and incidence angle secondly almost all these studies relied on pressure integration to derive the force coefficients or used visualization techniques to obtain the flow patterns which are however basically qualitative the only study that directly measured the flow fields is bansal and yarusevych 2017 however that study was limited to the pitch ratio of p d 1 35 which is rather small as compared to that commonly used in offshore structures for example 3 45 p d 5 17 for typical semi submersibles liu et al 2016 in addition kubo et al 1995 showed that p d 4 is the optimal pitch ratio for suppressing fiv of the three cylinder array therefore quantitative measurement data of three cylinder array are desirable to gain deeper insight into the underlying flow physics and to validate cfd models this motivates the present study using particle image velocimetry piv since it is capable of measuring the whole domain of instantaneous flow fields in a non intrusive manner the effects of varying pitch ratio over the range p d 2 8 5 2 and incidence angle over the range α 0 30 with an interval of 5 are examined as compared to published literature the main contribution of the present study is a wider range of pitch ratios considered 2 experimental set up and methodology 2 1 experimental set up the experiments were performed in a re circulating open channel flume having a test section that was 5 m long 0 3 m wide and 0 45 m deep both the side walls and bottom wall of the test section were made of glass for the ease of optical accessibility the cylinder models were made of smooth plexiglass rod with d 20 mm during the experiments the water depth was kept constant with the oncoming flow velocity maintained at u 0 4 m s corresponding to re 8000 based on the cylinder diameter three cylinders were hanged as vertical cantilevers in the test section forming an equilateral triangular array with desired spacing as schematically shown in fig 1 the upper end of each cylinder was fixed to a separate load cell which was in turn mounted onto a top plate that could rotate to the desired angle of incidence α with respect to the oncoming flow the lower end of each cylinder had a small clearance of 2 mm 0 1 d from the surface of an end plate to encourage two dimensionality of the flow slaouti and gerrard 1981 fig 1 b shows the arrangement of the three cylinders labeled as cy 1 cy 2 and cy 3 whose centers form an equilateral triangle the circumcircle of the triangle has a diameter of d 0 2 3 p which is varied as 64 80 100 and 120 mm this corresponds to the change in cylinder spacing which can be expressed as dimeter ratio d o d 3 2 4 5 and 6 or pitch ratio p d 2 8 3 5 4 3 and 5 2 respectively alternatively the spacing between the cylinders can be expressed in non dimensional longitudinal and transverse pitch ratios l d and t d respectively the origin of the coordinate system coincides with the center of the circumcircle or the center of the cylinder array x y and z denote the streamwise transverse and spanwise directions respectively the free stream velocity and the positive drag are along x axis and the positive lift is along y axis the incidence angle α is measured counter clockwise from the line joining the centers of cy 1 and cy 3 to positive x axis in the present study α was varied from 0 to 30 at an interval of 5 2 2 measurement system the blockage ratio of each cylinder was about 6 7 a value similar to that used in lam et al 2003 and wang et al 2013 on four cylinder arrays the immersed length of each cylinder was 200 mm yielding an aspect ratio the cylinder s length to diameter ratio of 10 which was large enough to ensure the flow to be nominally 2 d along the majority of the cylinder span lam and zou 2010 thus the flow measurements were carried out on the horizontal mid span plane by a lavision piv system operating in double frame double exposure mode a laser light sheet of about 1 mm in thickness generated by a double cavity nd yag laser wavelength 532 nm power 135 mj per pulse duration 5 ns was used to illuminate the flow field as shown in fig 1 a neutrally buoyant sphericel 110p8 hollow glass spheres of 10 15 μm in diameter were added as tracer particles a 14 bit ccd camera spatial resolution 1600 1200 pixels sampling frequency 15 hz was mounted below the channel to capture the particle images through the channel bottom wall and the end plate both of which were transparent the size of field of view was 200 150 mm2 for each case piv acquisitions were made for a duration of 84 s at a sampling frequency of 15 hz hence 1260 pairs of double frame images were obtained to achieve reasonably converged statistics of the flow such as mean and turbulence properties the obtained particle images were processed by lavision davis software version 7 2 using the fast fourier transform fft based cross correlation algorithm the particle displacements representing the flow velocities were evaluated with a window deformation iterative multi grid with window size down to 32 32 pixels at 50 overlap and the final spatial resolution was 2 mm2 the time interval between each pair of images was set at 1 ms so that a maximum displacement in the free stream was about 7 pixels satisfying the criterion for optimum cross correlation proposed by boillot and prasad 1996 the uncertainties in the instantaneous velocities u and v and the instantaneous spanwise vorticity ω z δ v δ x δ u δ y were estimated to be about 2 and 10 respectively the reader is referred to wang and tan 2007 for more details about the piv post processing procedure and uncertainty analysis as shown in fig 1 a a load cell kistler model 9317b mounted on the top of each cylinder was used to directly measure the hydrodynamic forces viz drag f d and lift f l on it featured in an inherently low cross talk this type of piezoelectric load cell can measure the three orthogonal force components precisely and hence has been widely used to measure the hydrodynamic forces on cylinders in similar configuration e g lam et al 2003 wang et al 2013 zhang et al 2019 the output of the load cell has been validated by a dynamic response test with reference to the input recorded by a strain gauge sensor zhao et al 2014 showing that the accuracy was within 2 each load cell was connected with an amplifier controlled by a computer the output signal was then captured with a data acquisition card national instruments ni usb 6221 austin tx at a sampling rate of 1000 hz for each case the force measurement was undertaken concurrent with the velocity measurement using piv but with a slightly longer duration 100 s vs 84 s the instantaneous drag and lift coefficients on the cylinder can be obtained as c d 2 f d ρ u 2 a and c l 2 f l ρ u 2 a where a is the projected area of the cylinder to the oncoming flow then the mean drag and lift coefficients c d and c l as well as the root mean square rms values c d and c l could be calculated the experimental set up was installed in an air conditioned room and water temperature in the flume remained at 22 8 0 2 c during the measurements so the effect due to temperature variation could be considered negligible 2 3 data validation both piv and force measurements have been conducted on the standalone single cylinder at the same reynolds number re 8000 using the above set up and apparatus the purpose is two fold i to validate against published data and ii to provide a basis for comparison with the results of the cylinders in the array that are subjected to flow interference the force coefficients for the standalone cylinder are c d 0 1 1 c l 0 0 c d 0 0 06 and c l 0 0 14 which agree well with those reported by tadrist et al 1990 at similar reynolds numbers in addition the frequency of vortex shedding f from the cylinder could be obtained by spectral analysis of the fluctuating lift signal the calculated strouhal number defined as st f d u is 0 2 is also consistent with that reported in tadrist et al 1990 fig 2 presents the ensemble averaged mean flow structures in the wake of the standalone cylinder fig 2 a shows the streamline patterns superimposed by flood contours of the mean spanwise vorticity which is characterized by a symmetric recirculation zone with a pair of counter rotating bubbles the length scale of the recirculation zone l r is defined as the streamwise distance from the cylinder base to the saddle point where the streamlines intersect roshko 1993 in the present study l r d 1 6 which agrees well with the reported values of 1 69 by jordan 2002 and 1 6 by norberg 2003 both at re 8000 as suggested by ozkan et al 2017 the value of l r can also be used as a quantitative indicator of vortex formation length to describe the turbulence properties spatial distributions of the normalized reynolds shear stress rss u v u 2 and turbulent kinetic energy tke u 2 v 2 u 2 in the wake of the cylinder are provided in fig 2 b and c respectively the rss distributions are nearly anti symmetric about x axis from which one can appreciate the spatial development of shear layers besides a pair of small scale clusters behind the cylinder base there are a pair of large scale clusters with peak values of 0 067 and 0 066 respectively which correspond to periodic vortex shedding from the two sides of the cylinder on the other hand the tke distribution is symmetric about x axis with a peak value of 0 23 as shown in fig 2 c note that the streamwise extents of peak rss and tke are almost the same at about 1 7 1 8 d which is slightly longer than l r a value falling in the range reported by dong et al 2006 that is 1 9 2 05 d for re 4000 and 1 4 d for re 10 000 3 results and discussion 3 1 flow patterns fig 3 presents the schematic diagram of the flow patterns of the three cylinder array which involves the interactions of six shear layers from the upper and lower sides of each cylinder fig 4 depicts the effects of varying spacing ratio d o d 3 2 4 and 5 and incidence angle α 0 10 20 and 30 on the instantaneous flow fields obtained by piv based on a careful examination of fig 4 and the time series of instantaneous piv snapshots for each case three and two steps of flow patterns can be categorized with reference to d o d and α respectively a sketch of the six different flow patterns is provided in fig 5 i at α 0 top row of fig 4 cy 1 and cy 3 are arranged in tandem whereas cy 2 is arranged side by side with respect to the other two cylinders it can be seen that at this incidence angle vortex shedding always occurs from cy 2 indicating that it is relatively free of flow interference on the other hand cy 1 and cy 3 displays strong interference depending on the value of d o d most notably the behaviors of upper and lower shear layers emanated from the upstream cylinder cy 1 usl 1 and lsl 1 at d o d 3 2 both shear layers exhibit as elongated chains of vorticity in kelvin helmholtz k h type of roll up hence no discrete vortices are formed from cy 1 similar flow pattern was found for two cylinders in tandem wang et al 2015 however due to the sandwich effects imposed by cy 2 usl 1 is deflected downward along negative y axis and tends to reattach on the leading face of the downstream cylinder cy 3 therefore it is in the shear layer reattachment regime or abbreviately called reattachment regime similar flow pattern is found for d o d 4 but usl 1 becomes more straightened due to the reduction in proximity effect from cy 2 at d o d 5 by contrast it is in the vortex impinging regime the shear layers emanated from cy 1 begin to roll up into large scale von kármán like vortices which periodically shed and impinge on the leading face of cy 3 the critical pitch ratio for flow regime transition is about 4 which is in accordance with the reported values of 3 5 in the literature on two cylinders in tandem e g xu and zhou 2004 ii when α increases to 10 or 20 cy 3 gradually deviates from the wake of cy 1 and becomes more exposed to the oncoming flow for d o d 3 2 or 4 at α 10 the reattachment point of usl 1 on cy 3 shifts downwards as compared to that at α 0 as α increases to 20 usl 1 is no longer reattaching on cy 3 instead it extends well through the gap between cy 1 and cy 3 and sweeps past the bottom face of cy 3 inducing flow separation from the lower surface of cy 3 similar flow pattern is observed by sumner et al 2000 for two circular cylinders in staggered configuration meanwhile for a fixed spacing the transverse distance between cy 2 and cy 3 which is t d 3 2 d o c o s α 30 continues to decease with increasing α this leads to an increase in the interference between cy 2 and cy 3 the lower shear layer of cy 2 lsl 2 and the upper shear layer of cy 3 usl 3 exhibit as synchronized vortex shedding processes in an anti phase fashion a phenomenon also found for two cylinders arranged side by side sumner et al 1999 when the spacing is large e g d o d 5 the flow interference between cy 1 and cy 3 is still in vortex impinging regime but only the upper shear layer i e usl 1 impinges periodically onto the leading surface of cy 3 hence called 1 sided impinging in fig 5 while the flow interference between cy 2 and cy 3 is insignificant due to relatively large spacing iii at α 30 the flow becomes symmetric about x axis with cy 1 and cy 2 arranged side by side and located upstream of cy 3 two types of flow patterns can be identified with reference to cylinder spacing at small spacing d o d 4 the two shear layers from cy 3 display strong interactions with both usl 1 and lsl 2 resulting in synchronized vortex shedding patterns at large spacing d o d 5 the flow interference among the cylinder diminishes and vortex shedding occurs independently from each cylinder for a fixed α the flow interference among the cylinders tends to decrease monotonically with increasing d o d for a fixed d o d however the effects of varying α from 0 to 30 are not monotonic on the one hand the increase of α is generally favorable for transition of the flow between cy 1 and cy 3 from steady reattachment regime to periodic vortex shedding regime on the other hand vortex shedding from cy 2 tends to be suppressed due to the increased interference between cy 2 and cy 3 particularly when d o d is small the effects of d o d and α are also evident in the mean velocity vector fields u v presented in fig 6 it can be observed that the main flow in between cy 1 and cy 2 is split into two branches a lower branch through the gap between cy 1 and cy3 and an upper branch through the gap between cy 2 and cy 3 these two branches of gap flow vary in size and magnitude with the change in cylinder spacing and incidence angle take d o d 3 2 as an example initially at α 0 the lower branch of gap flow is rather weak but its strength increases with α until 30 at which flow symmetry is achieved meanwhile the main flow in between cy 1 and cy 2 which is basically aligned along the streamwise direction at small α begin to diverge into two branches of gap flow with a considerable angle correspondingly the shape and size of recirculation zone behind the cylinders are also a function of both α and d o d as shown in fig 2 a the recirculation zone for a cylinder undergoing periodic vortex shedding is featured as a symmetric pair of recirculation bubbles with similar size and magnitude this symmetry is undermined by the flow interference among the cylinders for example in the case of large α where flow divergence about cy 3 is significant the recirculation bubble behind the upstream cylinder cy 1 or cy 2 becomes squeezed in the transverse direction and slanted in the streamwise direction whereas that behind the downstream cylinder cy 3 is much wider and longer in the case of d o d α 3 2 30 for instance l r for cy 3 is as high as about 3 d on the other hand for cylinders that are subjected to minimal flow interference such as cy 1 in the case of d o d α 5 0 l r approaches the value of 1 6 d for the standalone cylinder the distributions of rss around the cylinders are provided in fig 7 two overall trends can be seen with reference to the variation in α and d o d respectively as α increases from 0 to 30 the flow gradually becomes symmetric about x axis with the increase of d o d regions of significant rss which are initially located in the lee of the cylinder array gradually shift to upstream positions towards the cylinders together with elevated level or magnitude of rss take the pair of cylinders in tandem cy 1 and cy 3 at α 0 as an example at d o d 3 2 regions of significant rss are mainly located downstream of cy 3 when d o d increases to 5 they move upstream to the interstitial region between cy 1 and cy 3 indicative of stronger flow interference between the two cylinders in fact based on the distribution and magnitude of rss one can identify the different flow patterns reattachment or vortex shedding which are in convective instability and absolute instability respectively in the former the shear layers are elongated chains of k h vorticity which develop basically independently and lack of mutual interaction in the latter significant momentum exchange between the shear layers occurs leading to an increase in the magnitude of rss for a cylinder undergoing vortex shedding e g cy 2 at α 0 or all the three cylinders at d o d 5 besides the two large scale clusters of rss there are two additional small scale clusters of opposite signed rss immediately upstream of the main clusters a phenomenon that is evident for the standalone cylinder as shown in fig 2 b a similar feature has been reported by dong et al 2006 on a standalone cylinder based on piv measurements and direct numerical simulations this feature can be used to indicate whether vortex shedding occurs or not moreover when vortex shedding takes place the magnitude of rss around that cylinder would approach or even exceed the corresponding value of 0 067 for the standalone cylinder e g cy 1 or cy 2 in the case of d o d α 5 10 the elevated rss level is likely due to the acceleration of the flow through the gaps between the cylinders in the array therefore the ensemble averaged statistical quantities can provide useful information about the dynamic flow features such as vortex shedding and flow interference without inspecting the large amount of piv data snapshot by snapshot 3 2 vortex shedding frequencies the effects of d o d and α on vortex shedding frequency can be evaluated by performing power spectral analysis of the instantaneous lift on each cylinder fig 8 a c presents the results for d o d 3 2 at α 0 15 and 30 respectively at α 0 both cy 1 and cy 3 show the lack of well defined peaks which is consistent with flow pattern observed for this case i e in impingement regime without vortex shedding cy 2 however exhibits a relatively well defined peak at st 0 2 which corresponds to periodic vortex shedding as can be observed in the instantaneous flow fields when α increases spectral peaks albeit broad banded begin to occur on the two cylinders in staggered configuration which are identifiable on cy 3 only at α 15 and then on both cylinders at α 30 this is attributed to the flow pattern that the shear layers emanated from cy 1 would induce flow separation and hence vortex shedding from the downstream cylinder cy 3 on the other hand the spectral peaks of cy 2 become attenuated with increasing α due to the increased interference with cy 3 each of the two upstream cylinders cy 1 or cy 2 is characterized with one spectral peak at st 0 25 whereas the downstream cylinder cy 3 is associated with two distinct values of strouhal number namely one at st 0 25 and the other at st 0 09 similar two peak phenomenon has been reported for two cylinders in staggered arrangement sumner et al 2000 or closely spaced four cylinder array e g lam et al 2003 wang et al 2013 the peaks at st 0 25 and 0 09 are associated with vortex shedding from the upstream and downstream cylinders respectively the explanations are as follows as shown in fig 4 when α is relatively large α 20 or 30 the flow entering in between cy 1 and cy 2 diverge at a considerable angle resulting in an obviously narrower wake behind either cy 1 or cy 2 and wider wake behind cy 3 which can be easily appreciated by the mean recirculation patterns in fig 6 and the rss distribution in fig 7 for this case it is well known that the width of the wake is closely linked with the vortex shedding frequency from the cylinder the broader the wake the lower the vortex shedding frequency and vice versa sumner et al 1999 therefore the upstream and downstream cylinders respectively have higher and lower st than that of st 0 2 for a standalone cylinder since the three cylinders are in proximity to each other and cy 3 is located at a relatively downstream position vortices shed from the upstream cylinder cy 1 or cy 2 can have footprint on cy 3 resulting in the 2 peak behavior in its lift power spectra this is consistent with the finding reported by han et al 2018 that the three cylinder array exhibits galloping phenomenon particularly at p d α 4 30 this 2 peak behavior needs to be paid attention in designing multi cylinder system to prevent or minimize resonance by keeping the natural frequencies of the system away from all possible vortex shedding frequencies a similar 2 peak behavior is observed on cy 3 for the case of d o d 4 but at α 30 only as shown in fig 9 this is plausible because the flow interference among the cylinders is reduced with the increase in spacing in addition it is noteworthy to highlight the values of high and low st which are 0 21 and 0 12 respectively as compared to the case of d o d 3 2 for which st 0 25 and 0 09 both values are closer to the baseline value of 0 2 for a standalone cylinder implying reduced flow interference among the cylinders in addition nearly all the cylinders except for cy 1 at α 0 display well defined spectral peaks with much higher amplitude which symbolizes the strength of vortex shedding than that of d o d 3 2 indicating the occurrence of vortex shedding fig 10 shows that when d o d increases to 5 each cylinder exhibits a sole identical frequency at st 0 2 this indicates that the interference among the cylinders has decreased to such a level that each cylinder is undergoing periodic vortex shedding since cy 3 is located downstream either in the tandem arrangement when α 0 or in the staggered arrangement when α 0 it is more or less subjected to impingement of vortices shed from the upstream cylinder s as a consequence the amplitude of the spectral speak is always higher than that of the other two cylinders 3 3 hydrodynamic force coefficients fig 11 13 show the statistical force coefficients including mean and rms drag lift coefficients c d c d c l and c l on each cylinder versus d o d for α 0 15 and 30 respectively in these figures the values of the mean drag and rms lift coefficients measured for the standalone cylinder under the same flow condition c d 0 1 2 and c l 0 0 14 are added for comparison purpose for the case of α 0 the mean drag coefficient of cy 2 c d 2 maintains at about 1 2 invariant to cylinder spacing which is close to the corresponding value of a standalone cylinder c d 0 in comparison relatively low mean drag coefficients are found for the pair of cylinders in tandem cy 1 and cy 3 c d 1 is nearly constant about 1 0 whereas c d 3 is even lower and varies with spacing at d o d 3 2 or 4 c d 3 is about 0 5 but then increases sharply to about 0 8 at d o d 5 fig 11 a this sharp increase in mean drag coefficient is associated with the flow transition from reattachment regime to vortex impinging regime 1st row of fig 4 note that at d o d 3 2 c d 3 0 5 is slightly higher than the corresponding value of 0 3 for the downstream cylinder in tandem arrangement at similar spacing wang et al 2015 this is attributed to the presence of cy 2 which causes usl 1 to bend downward and reattach on the leading face of cy 3 whereas for two cylinders in tandem arrangement the downstream cylinder is largely engulfed in the wake of the upstream one the effect of flow transition is also evident on the rms drag coefficient of cy 3 c d 3 fig 11 a and rms lift coefficient of cy 3 c l 3 fig 11 b both of which exhibit an abrupt increase from d o d 4 to 5 at this incidence angle the mean lift on each cylinder is non zero due to flow asymmetry particularly cy 3 at small spacing for example c l 3 0 6 at d o d 3 2 fig 11 b which agrees with the downward deflection of usl 1 and reattachment on the leading surface of cy 3 due to the presence of cy 2 see fig 4 with increasing spacing and hence decreasing interference from cy 2 the magnitude of c l 3 reduces to c l 3 0 2 at d o d 4 and 5 and finally to c l 3 0 at d o d 6 indicative of diminishing of proximity effects from cy 2 this trend is consistent with previous observations in the mean velocity vector fields 1st row of fig 6 that the upper shear layer from cy 1 usl 1 becomes more straightened with the increase in d o d fig 12 a shows that when α increases to 15 the mean and rms drag coefficients of the three cylinders display roughly the same variation trends with reference to d o d as those at α 0 however because cy 3 is exposed to the oncoming flow to some extent the mean drag coefficient at small spacing is considerably higher than that at α 0 for example c d 3 0 9 at d o d 3 2 vs 0 5 for α 0 at the same spacing on the other hand the downward deflection of usl 1 is more obvious see 2nd row of fig 4 or fig 6 resulting in c l 3 0 for all values of d o d fig 12 b when α increases to 30 the flow attains symmetry about x axis with cy 1 and cy 2 located upstream in side by side arrangement therefore the values of c d c d and c l for the two upstream cylinders cy 1 and cy 2 are basically equal fig 13 for the downstream cylinder cy 3 the mean drag coefficient is slightly lower at small spacing c d 3 1 0 and 1 1 at d o d 3 2 and 4 respectively but then quickly attains the value for the standalone cylinder implying that flow interference among the cylinders is limited to small spacing cases according to fig 13 b at small spacings c l 1 0 and c l 2 0 suggesting that there is a net repulsive force between the pair of upstream cylinders similar phenomenon has been observed for the two side by side cylinders sumner et al 1999 and for a four cylinder array in inline arrangement wang et al 2013 in addition since cy 3 is located at a relatively downstream position it is more or less subjected to the effects of shear layers emanated from upstream cylinders therefore the rms lift coefficient is always higher than that of the two upstream cylinders particularly when vortex shedding occurs from the upstream cylinders correspondingly the transverse vibration amplitude of cy 3 is consistently higher than that of cy 1 cy 2 or a standalone cylinder as shown by wang et al 2013 for a three cylinder array undergoing fiv in both α 15 and α 30 cases the value of d o d at which flow transition occurs becomes smaller that is at d o d 3 2 4 for α 15 or 30 as compared to that d o d 4 5 for α 0 this phenomenon is in agreement with the piv results that vortex shedding from cy 1 indeed occurs at d o d 4 for α 15 or 30 whereas it does not occur until d o d 5 for α 0 this indicates that for a given spacing the increase of α is beneficial for the onset of vortex shedding to illustrate the effects of cylinder array orientation with respect to the oncoming flow fig 14 provides the variations of the averaged force coefficients c d c l c d and c l of the three cylinders versus α at different values of d o d together with the corresponding values for the standalone cylinder as the reference as shown in fig 14 a the averaged drag coefficient c d generally increases with both incidence angle and spacing ratio when α is small the downstream cylinder cy 3 might be completely or partially located in the wake of the upstream cylinder cy 1 and hence is subject to a lower drag as α increases all the cylinders become more exposed to oncoming flow leading to the increase in c d it can be seen that the values of c d for large spacing d o d 5 or 6 would approach that of the standalone cylinder c d 0 at α 25 this agrees with the flow visualization results that flow interference becomes minimal in the cases of d o d 5 and α 30 for small spacing d o d 3 2 or 4 however the values of c d are always lower than c d 0 which is due to the flow interference among the cylinders therefore the value of the averaged drag coefficient c d can be used as an indicator to evaluate the severity of interference among the cylinders in the array fig 14 b indicates that the mean lift coefficient c l is negative for almost all cases indicating that the cylinder array is experiencing a mean downward force fig 14 c shows that the rms drag coefficient c d for each d o d attains a peak at moderate α 5 20 in terms of the maximum value of c d one can appreciate the difference between the small and large spacing cases which are respectively lower and higher than that of the standalone cylinder c d 0 similarly the averaged rms lift coefficient displays different behaviors depending on whether the spacing is small or large as shown in fig 14 d at small spacing d o d 3 2 or 4 c l is always less than c l 0 and does not vary much with α at large spacing d o d 5 or 6 by contrast c l is higher than c l 0 and decrease with increasing α within the range considered these phenomena are in accordance with the piv results that as d o d increases the flow around the cylinders experiences the transition from steady reattachment regime to unsteady vortex shedding regime the latter is associated with much higher fluctuating lift particularly for the cylinder located in the wake of another one see for example cy 3 in the case of α 0 and d o d 5 or 6 in this case c l 3 is extraordinarily high which is about 0 6 see fig 11 b or about 6 times higher than that of 0 1 for the other two cylinders located relatively upstream the extraordinarily high value of c l 3 is due to impingement of vortices shed from cy 1 on the leading face of cy 3 besides the fluctuating lift generated by vortex shedding from cy 3 itself as α increases cy 3 gradually deviates from the wake of cy 1 and becomes more exposed to the oncoming flow resulting in a decrease in the impingement effects from cy 1 therefore the averaged rms lift coefficient c l is decreasing with the increase in α fig 14 d also shows that for a given α the value of c l for d o d 6 is consistently lower than that for d o d 5 or closer to that of the standalone cylinder c l 0 implying that flow interference among the cylinders decreases with spacing it is expected that when d o d is sufficiently large c l at α 30 would approach c l 0 4 concluding remarks the effects of varying spacing ratio d o d 3 2 6 or p d 2 8 5 2 and incidence angle α 0 30 on the flow around a three cylinder array arranged in equilateral triangular configuration under a subcritical reynolds number re 8000 are investigated based on detailed measurements of flow field using particle image velocimetry piv and hydrodynamic forces on each cylinder using piezoelectric load cell the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the flow structure is strongly dependent on both spacing ratio and incidence angle resulting in a variety of flow patterns over the d o d α parameter space considered with reference to d o d the flow patterns could be broadly divided into two types namely shear layer reattachment regime and vortex shedding regime at small d o d 4 and large d o d 5 spacings respectively the effects of α are more complex since they are also dependent on the value of d o d when the cylinder spacing is small the flow experiences a transition from reattachment regime to induced separation regime and finally synchronized vortex shedding regime at small α 0 moderate α 10 20 and large α 30 respectively when the spacing is large on the other hand the three corresponding regimes are 2 sided impinging 1 sided impinging and independent vortex shedding at small moderate and large α respectively 2 the effects of flow interference among the cylinders due to the variation in cylinder spacing and incidence angle are also appreciable in the mean velocity vector field u v and the distributions of reynolds shear stress rss with corresponding measurement data for a standalone cylinder at the same reynolds number provided for comparison purpose notably upon flow transition from reattachment regime to vortex impinging regime the distributions of rss become more squeezed in the streamwise direction towards the cylinder base with significantly elevated level of rss when vortex shedding occurs the rss around that cylinder approaches that of the standalone cylinder in terms of both spatial distribution and magnitude 3 the different flow patterns over the d o d α parameter space are also evident in the power spectra of the fluctuating lift coefficient on each cylinder at large spacing d o d 5 that lies in vortex shedding regime the three cylinders in the array always exhibit a sole identical frequency at st 0 2 at small spacing d o d 4 an identical frequency is observed for the two upstream cylinders cy 1 and cy 2 once vortex shedding occurs the downstream cylinder cy 3 however displays different features depending on the value of α i e one and two peak modes for small and large α respectively the high and low frequency components at st 0 2 and st 0 2 respectively in the two peak mode are attributed to the vortex shedding from the upstream cylinder s and the downstream cylinder itself respectively 4 moreover the effects of varying d o d and α are discernible in the mean and rms drag lift coefficients on the three cylinders either individually or as a whole group when the flow undergoes transition from reattachment regime to vortex impinging regime the downstream cylinder cy 3 experiences a sharp increase in the mean drag coefficient i e from c d 3 0 5 to 0 8 also the averaged mean drag coefficient of the cylinder array approaches c d 0 1 2 for the standalone cylinder only when both the cylinder spacing and incidence angle are large enough d o d 5 and α 25 the mean lift coefficients on the array and particularly on cy 3 to be considerably negative up to c l 3 0 6 over the small to moderate α range which is consistent with the flow asymmetry about x axis such as the downward deflection of usl 1 and reattachment on the leading surface of cy 3 the downstream cylinder in the array i e cy 3 generally experiences a lower mean drag but assume remarkably higher rms drag and lift

21555,a three cylinder array arranged in equilateral triangular configuration represents one of the most common basic units of multi cylinder systems in engineering practice the present study investigates this flow configuration focusing on the effects of the cylinders spacing ratio p d 2 8 5 2 and the array orientation with reference to the oncoming flow α 0 30 under a fixed reynolds number 8000 based on the cylinder diameter d the hydrodynamic forces drag and lift on each cylinder were directly measured using piezoelectric load cells together with concurrent flow measurements using particle image velocimetry piv technique to quantitatively visualize the shear layer development vortex formation and interaction process the flow interference among the cylinders which shares some similarities with that of two cylinders arranged in side by side tandem or staggered configuration is further complicated due to the presence of the third cylinder and exhibits many unique features a number of different flow patterns including shear layer reattachment induced separation synchronized or independent vortex shedding etc are identified over the p d α parameter space the effects of flow interference are also quantified in terms of reynolds shear stress distributions around the cylinder array mean and root mean square rms drag lift coefficients and vortex shedding frequencies of each cylinder keywords three cylinder array equilateral triangular arrangement flow interference hydrodynamic force coefficients particle image velocimetry piv 1 introduction the flow around circular cylinders has been extensively studied due to its importance in many practical applications such as offshore structures chimneys and heat exchangers in many cases the cylinders are always arranged in groups or arrays e g three or four cylinder arrays see the review by khalifa et al 2012 flow interference among the cylinders in a multi cylinder array may give rise to flow separation reattachment and vortex impingement as well as flow induced vibration fiv han et al 2018 in particular a three cylinder array arranged in equilateral triangular configuration is widely used in marine and offshore engineering such as tension leg platforms deep draft semi submersibles liang et al 2017 and floating turbines goldschmidt and muskulus 2015 gonçalves et al 2018 as well as other situations where deep water steel catenary and flexible risers are trapped together as bundles to obtain better mechanical properties han et al 2018 the published studies in the literature have revealed that this type of flow is complex and is determined by three basic parameters i the cylinder to cylinder spacing which is typically expressed as the pitch ratio p d where p is the cylinders centre to centre pitch or distance and d is the cylinder diameter ii the incidence angle of the array relative to the oncoming flow α and iii reynolds number re ρ u d μ where ρ is the density of fluid u is the free stream velocity and μ is the dynamic viscosity of fluid table 1 summaries a list of published studies experimental and numerical on this flow configuration among others which investigated the effects of varying the three parameters p d α and re as can be inferred from table 1 except for kubo et al 1995 gonçalves et al 2018 and ma et al 2019 2020 that studied fiv of the cylinder array most of the previous experimental studies considered the case of rigid type of cylinders under fixed mounting condition sayers 1987 measured the force coefficients and vortex shedding frequencies through pressure measurements around the circumference of one of the three cylinders since only one cylinder was instrumented with pressure transducers the cylinder array was rotated from 0 to 45 in steps of 7 5 to obtain the force coefficients on the other two cylinders and hence details of the interference effect among the three cylinders were unclear the effects of spacing ratio and incidence angle on the flow interference among the three cylinders were examined by lam and cheung 1988 using dye injection flow visualization it was concluded that the bi stable flow pattern occurred at p d 1 27 2 29 depends on the starting conditions based on pressure measurements around the circumference of each cylinder tatsuno et al 1998 showed that the effects of flow interference among the three cylinders are severe when the spacing is small when two cylinders arranged side by side are upstream of or behind the third one the flow patterns are not symmetrical with respect to the oncoming flow direction correspondingly the drag or lift coefficients of the two cylinders are not always equal to each other gu and sun 2001 tried to categorize the different types of flow interference among the cylinders with reference to pitch ratio four different levels of interference were identified s i e small 1 7 p d 2 0 medium p d 2 2 transition 2 5 p d 3 0 and larger p d 4 0 where the small pitch ratio range can be further sub divided into three types i e interference of proximity shear layer reattachment and wake with α varied from 0 to 60 seven steps of flow pattern can be divided pouryoussefi et al 2011 investigated the effects of varying pitch ratio and reynolds number under a fixed incidence angle of α 0 i e one cylinder is located upstream and the other two are located downstream arranged side by side it was found that both the drag coefficients and the vortex shedding frequencies are functions of pitch ratio whereas the mean lift force coefficients of the upstream cylinder are nearly zero located in the wake of the upstream cylinders the downstream cylinders are usually subjected to lower mean drag but higher fluctuating forces bansal and yarusevych 2017 examined the effects of incidence angle over the range 0 α 60 for a fixed pitch ratio p d 1 35 and reynolds number re 2100 they discovered that large scale vortex shedding is observed about 5 d downstream of the cylinder array and the value of strouhal number st when scaled by the projected height of the three cylinders is approximately identical to that of an isolated cylinder of equivalent diameter on the other hand aided by the rapid development of computing power and advance in computational fluid dynamics cfd technique a number of numerical studies have been conducted on this flow configuration over the past decade most of them are 2d simulations at relatively low reynolds numbers re 200 or in the laminar regime for the case of fixed rigid cylinders e g bao et al 2010 yan et al 2016 yang et al 2016 zheng et al 2016 bao et al 2018 sayehvand et al 2018 bao et al 2010 investigated the effects of varying pitch ratio 1 5 p d 5 0 and incident angle α 0 30 and 60 at re 100 using a split fem yan et al 2016 and yang et al 2016 conducted simulations using lbm at re 100 200 together with laser induced fluorescence flow visualization two distinct flow patterns are identified namely steady flow 1 p d 1 2 and 2 5 p d 3 1 and unsteady flow 1 3 p d 2 4 and 3 2 p d 10 using a finite volume method zheng et al 2016 simulated the flow for incidence angles of α 0 and 60 at re 100 and 200 and identified three distinct flow patterns with respect to spacing ratio which are also dependent on re bao et al 2018 further illustrated that the flow patterns and force characteristics of the three cylinder array are the result of combined effects of reynolds number configuration arrangement cylinder spacing and incident angle the flow is classified into three categories with reference to the pitch ratio i biased flow at small spacing p d 1 5 ii disappearance of suppression effects on vortex shedding at medium spacing p d 4 and iii disappearance of mutual effects among the cylinders at large spacing p d 8 sayehvand et al 2018 investigated the heat transfer characteristics due to variation in reynolds number re 80 120 and 200 for a fixed pitch ratio p d 2 and incidence angle α 60 unlike these above mentioned studies that are in laminar regime several researchers numerically investigated this flow configuration in the sub critical regime for instance the 2d simulation by alam and cheng 2011 at re 1000 and the 3d simulation by gao et al 2019 at re 1500 and 3900 it was shown that the three dimensionality of the wake flow becomes stronger with the reynolds number in addition some researchers numerically studied the fluid structure interaction for three equally spaced elastically mounted rigid cylinders undergoing fiv wang et al 2013 considered the effects of typical incidence angles α 0 30 and 60 and reduced velocities 3 u r 12 for a fixed spacing p d 4 0 and reynolds number re 150 han et al 2018 investigated the fiv problem of a three cylinder array at the same pitch ratio p d 4 0 but in the sub critical regime with much higher reynolds numbers re 1000 30 000 corresponding to 1 u r 30 both studies discovered that the vortex shedding frequencies the vibration amplitudes and trajectories significantly rely upon the incidence angle and the reduced velocity moreover han et al 2018 showed that besides the conventional vortex induced vibration viv the wake induced vibration or galloping which is characterized by significant increase in vibration amplitude and decrease in vibration frequency occurs when α 30 several trends can be observed based on the review of relevant literatures firstly all the experimental studies were conducted exclusively in the sub critical regime the same regime as that generally encountered in engineering practice within this regime the flow is basically insensitive to reynolds number but varies significantly with cylinder spacing and incidence angle secondly almost all these studies relied on pressure integration to derive the force coefficients or used visualization techniques to obtain the flow patterns which are however basically qualitative the only study that directly measured the flow fields is bansal and yarusevych 2017 however that study was limited to the pitch ratio of p d 1 35 which is rather small as compared to that commonly used in offshore structures for example 3 45 p d 5 17 for typical semi submersibles liu et al 2016 in addition kubo et al 1995 showed that p d 4 is the optimal pitch ratio for suppressing fiv of the three cylinder array therefore quantitative measurement data of three cylinder array are desirable to gain deeper insight into the underlying flow physics and to validate cfd models this motivates the present study using particle image velocimetry piv since it is capable of measuring the whole domain of instantaneous flow fields in a non intrusive manner the effects of varying pitch ratio over the range p d 2 8 5 2 and incidence angle over the range α 0 30 with an interval of 5 are examined as compared to published literature the main contribution of the present study is a wider range of pitch ratios considered 2 experimental set up and methodology 2 1 experimental set up the experiments were performed in a re circulating open channel flume having a test section that was 5 m long 0 3 m wide and 0 45 m deep both the side walls and bottom wall of the test section were made of glass for the ease of optical accessibility the cylinder models were made of smooth plexiglass rod with d 20 mm during the experiments the water depth was kept constant with the oncoming flow velocity maintained at u 0 4 m s corresponding to re 8000 based on the cylinder diameter three cylinders were hanged as vertical cantilevers in the test section forming an equilateral triangular array with desired spacing as schematically shown in fig 1 the upper end of each cylinder was fixed to a separate load cell which was in turn mounted onto a top plate that could rotate to the desired angle of incidence α with respect to the oncoming flow the lower end of each cylinder had a small clearance of 2 mm 0 1 d from the surface of an end plate to encourage two dimensionality of the flow slaouti and gerrard 1981 fig 1 b shows the arrangement of the three cylinders labeled as cy 1 cy 2 and cy 3 whose centers form an equilateral triangle the circumcircle of the triangle has a diameter of d 0 2 3 p which is varied as 64 80 100 and 120 mm this corresponds to the change in cylinder spacing which can be expressed as dimeter ratio d o d 3 2 4 5 and 6 or pitch ratio p d 2 8 3 5 4 3 and 5 2 respectively alternatively the spacing between the cylinders can be expressed in non dimensional longitudinal and transverse pitch ratios l d and t d respectively the origin of the coordinate system coincides with the center of the circumcircle or the center of the cylinder array x y and z denote the streamwise transverse and spanwise directions respectively the free stream velocity and the positive drag are along x axis and the positive lift is along y axis the incidence angle α is measured counter clockwise from the line joining the centers of cy 1 and cy 3 to positive x axis in the present study α was varied from 0 to 30 at an interval of 5 2 2 measurement system the blockage ratio of each cylinder was about 6 7 a value similar to that used in lam et al 2003 and wang et al 2013 on four cylinder arrays the immersed length of each cylinder was 200 mm yielding an aspect ratio the cylinder s length to diameter ratio of 10 which was large enough to ensure the flow to be nominally 2 d along the majority of the cylinder span lam and zou 2010 thus the flow measurements were carried out on the horizontal mid span plane by a lavision piv system operating in double frame double exposure mode a laser light sheet of about 1 mm in thickness generated by a double cavity nd yag laser wavelength 532 nm power 135 mj per pulse duration 5 ns was used to illuminate the flow field as shown in fig 1 a neutrally buoyant sphericel 110p8 hollow glass spheres of 10 15 μm in diameter were added as tracer particles a 14 bit ccd camera spatial resolution 1600 1200 pixels sampling frequency 15 hz was mounted below the channel to capture the particle images through the channel bottom wall and the end plate both of which were transparent the size of field of view was 200 150 mm2 for each case piv acquisitions were made for a duration of 84 s at a sampling frequency of 15 hz hence 1260 pairs of double frame images were obtained to achieve reasonably converged statistics of the flow such as mean and turbulence properties the obtained particle images were processed by lavision davis software version 7 2 using the fast fourier transform fft based cross correlation algorithm the particle displacements representing the flow velocities were evaluated with a window deformation iterative multi grid with window size down to 32 32 pixels at 50 overlap and the final spatial resolution was 2 mm2 the time interval between each pair of images was set at 1 ms so that a maximum displacement in the free stream was about 7 pixels satisfying the criterion for optimum cross correlation proposed by boillot and prasad 1996 the uncertainties in the instantaneous velocities u and v and the instantaneous spanwise vorticity ω z δ v δ x δ u δ y were estimated to be about 2 and 10 respectively the reader is referred to wang and tan 2007 for more details about the piv post processing procedure and uncertainty analysis as shown in fig 1 a a load cell kistler model 9317b mounted on the top of each cylinder was used to directly measure the hydrodynamic forces viz drag f d and lift f l on it featured in an inherently low cross talk this type of piezoelectric load cell can measure the three orthogonal force components precisely and hence has been widely used to measure the hydrodynamic forces on cylinders in similar configuration e g lam et al 2003 wang et al 2013 zhang et al 2019 the output of the load cell has been validated by a dynamic response test with reference to the input recorded by a strain gauge sensor zhao et al 2014 showing that the accuracy was within 2 each load cell was connected with an amplifier controlled by a computer the output signal was then captured with a data acquisition card national instruments ni usb 6221 austin tx at a sampling rate of 1000 hz for each case the force measurement was undertaken concurrent with the velocity measurement using piv but with a slightly longer duration 100 s vs 84 s the instantaneous drag and lift coefficients on the cylinder can be obtained as c d 2 f d ρ u 2 a and c l 2 f l ρ u 2 a where a is the projected area of the cylinder to the oncoming flow then the mean drag and lift coefficients c d and c l as well as the root mean square rms values c d and c l could be calculated the experimental set up was installed in an air conditioned room and water temperature in the flume remained at 22 8 0 2 c during the measurements so the effect due to temperature variation could be considered negligible 2 3 data validation both piv and force measurements have been conducted on the standalone single cylinder at the same reynolds number re 8000 using the above set up and apparatus the purpose is two fold i to validate against published data and ii to provide a basis for comparison with the results of the cylinders in the array that are subjected to flow interference the force coefficients for the standalone cylinder are c d 0 1 1 c l 0 0 c d 0 0 06 and c l 0 0 14 which agree well with those reported by tadrist et al 1990 at similar reynolds numbers in addition the frequency of vortex shedding f from the cylinder could be obtained by spectral analysis of the fluctuating lift signal the calculated strouhal number defined as st f d u is 0 2 is also consistent with that reported in tadrist et al 1990 fig 2 presents the ensemble averaged mean flow structures in the wake of the standalone cylinder fig 2 a shows the streamline patterns superimposed by flood contours of the mean spanwise vorticity which is characterized by a symmetric recirculation zone with a pair of counter rotating bubbles the length scale of the recirculation zone l r is defined as the streamwise distance from the cylinder base to the saddle point where the streamlines intersect roshko 1993 in the present study l r d 1 6 which agrees well with the reported values of 1 69 by jordan 2002 and 1 6 by norberg 2003 both at re 8000 as suggested by ozkan et al 2017 the value of l r can also be used as a quantitative indicator of vortex formation length to describe the turbulence properties spatial distributions of the normalized reynolds shear stress rss u v u 2 and turbulent kinetic energy tke u 2 v 2 u 2 in the wake of the cylinder are provided in fig 2 b and c respectively the rss distributions are nearly anti symmetric about x axis from which one can appreciate the spatial development of shear layers besides a pair of small scale clusters behind the cylinder base there are a pair of large scale clusters with peak values of 0 067 and 0 066 respectively which correspond to periodic vortex shedding from the two sides of the cylinder on the other hand the tke distribution is symmetric about x axis with a peak value of 0 23 as shown in fig 2 c note that the streamwise extents of peak rss and tke are almost the same at about 1 7 1 8 d which is slightly longer than l r a value falling in the range reported by dong et al 2006 that is 1 9 2 05 d for re 4000 and 1 4 d for re 10 000 3 results and discussion 3 1 flow patterns fig 3 presents the schematic diagram of the flow patterns of the three cylinder array which involves the interactions of six shear layers from the upper and lower sides of each cylinder fig 4 depicts the effects of varying spacing ratio d o d 3 2 4 and 5 and incidence angle α 0 10 20 and 30 on the instantaneous flow fields obtained by piv based on a careful examination of fig 4 and the time series of instantaneous piv snapshots for each case three and two steps of flow patterns can be categorized with reference to d o d and α respectively a sketch of the six different flow patterns is provided in fig 5 i at α 0 top row of fig 4 cy 1 and cy 3 are arranged in tandem whereas cy 2 is arranged side by side with respect to the other two cylinders it can be seen that at this incidence angle vortex shedding always occurs from cy 2 indicating that it is relatively free of flow interference on the other hand cy 1 and cy 3 displays strong interference depending on the value of d o d most notably the behaviors of upper and lower shear layers emanated from the upstream cylinder cy 1 usl 1 and lsl 1 at d o d 3 2 both shear layers exhibit as elongated chains of vorticity in kelvin helmholtz k h type of roll up hence no discrete vortices are formed from cy 1 similar flow pattern was found for two cylinders in tandem wang et al 2015 however due to the sandwich effects imposed by cy 2 usl 1 is deflected downward along negative y axis and tends to reattach on the leading face of the downstream cylinder cy 3 therefore it is in the shear layer reattachment regime or abbreviately called reattachment regime similar flow pattern is found for d o d 4 but usl 1 becomes more straightened due to the reduction in proximity effect from cy 2 at d o d 5 by contrast it is in the vortex impinging regime the shear layers emanated from cy 1 begin to roll up into large scale von kármán like vortices which periodically shed and impinge on the leading face of cy 3 the critical pitch ratio for flow regime transition is about 4 which is in accordance with the reported values of 3 5 in the literature on two cylinders in tandem e g xu and zhou 2004 ii when α increases to 10 or 20 cy 3 gradually deviates from the wake of cy 1 and becomes more exposed to the oncoming flow for d o d 3 2 or 4 at α 10 the reattachment point of usl 1 on cy 3 shifts downwards as compared to that at α 0 as α increases to 20 usl 1 is no longer reattaching on cy 3 instead it extends well through the gap between cy 1 and cy 3 and sweeps past the bottom face of cy 3 inducing flow separation from the lower surface of cy 3 similar flow pattern is observed by sumner et al 2000 for two circular cylinders in staggered configuration meanwhile for a fixed spacing the transverse distance between cy 2 and cy 3 which is t d 3 2 d o c o s α 30 continues to decease with increasing α this leads to an increase in the interference between cy 2 and cy 3 the lower shear layer of cy 2 lsl 2 and the upper shear layer of cy 3 usl 3 exhibit as synchronized vortex shedding processes in an anti phase fashion a phenomenon also found for two cylinders arranged side by side sumner et al 1999 when the spacing is large e g d o d 5 the flow interference between cy 1 and cy 3 is still in vortex impinging regime but only the upper shear layer i e usl 1 impinges periodically onto the leading surface of cy 3 hence called 1 sided impinging in fig 5 while the flow interference between cy 2 and cy 3 is insignificant due to relatively large spacing iii at α 30 the flow becomes symmetric about x axis with cy 1 and cy 2 arranged side by side and located upstream of cy 3 two types of flow patterns can be identified with reference to cylinder spacing at small spacing d o d 4 the two shear layers from cy 3 display strong interactions with both usl 1 and lsl 2 resulting in synchronized vortex shedding patterns at large spacing d o d 5 the flow interference among the cylinder diminishes and vortex shedding occurs independently from each cylinder for a fixed α the flow interference among the cylinders tends to decrease monotonically with increasing d o d for a fixed d o d however the effects of varying α from 0 to 30 are not monotonic on the one hand the increase of α is generally favorable for transition of the flow between cy 1 and cy 3 from steady reattachment regime to periodic vortex shedding regime on the other hand vortex shedding from cy 2 tends to be suppressed due to the increased interference between cy 2 and cy 3 particularly when d o d is small the effects of d o d and α are also evident in the mean velocity vector fields u v presented in fig 6 it can be observed that the main flow in between cy 1 and cy 2 is split into two branches a lower branch through the gap between cy 1 and cy3 and an upper branch through the gap between cy 2 and cy 3 these two branches of gap flow vary in size and magnitude with the change in cylinder spacing and incidence angle take d o d 3 2 as an example initially at α 0 the lower branch of gap flow is rather weak but its strength increases with α until 30 at which flow symmetry is achieved meanwhile the main flow in between cy 1 and cy 2 which is basically aligned along the streamwise direction at small α begin to diverge into two branches of gap flow with a considerable angle correspondingly the shape and size of recirculation zone behind the cylinders are also a function of both α and d o d as shown in fig 2 a the recirculation zone for a cylinder undergoing periodic vortex shedding is featured as a symmetric pair of recirculation bubbles with similar size and magnitude this symmetry is undermined by the flow interference among the cylinders for example in the case of large α where flow divergence about cy 3 is significant the recirculation bubble behind the upstream cylinder cy 1 or cy 2 becomes squeezed in the transverse direction and slanted in the streamwise direction whereas that behind the downstream cylinder cy 3 is much wider and longer in the case of d o d α 3 2 30 for instance l r for cy 3 is as high as about 3 d on the other hand for cylinders that are subjected to minimal flow interference such as cy 1 in the case of d o d α 5 0 l r approaches the value of 1 6 d for the standalone cylinder the distributions of rss around the cylinders are provided in fig 7 two overall trends can be seen with reference to the variation in α and d o d respectively as α increases from 0 to 30 the flow gradually becomes symmetric about x axis with the increase of d o d regions of significant rss which are initially located in the lee of the cylinder array gradually shift to upstream positions towards the cylinders together with elevated level or magnitude of rss take the pair of cylinders in tandem cy 1 and cy 3 at α 0 as an example at d o d 3 2 regions of significant rss are mainly located downstream of cy 3 when d o d increases to 5 they move upstream to the interstitial region between cy 1 and cy 3 indicative of stronger flow interference between the two cylinders in fact based on the distribution and magnitude of rss one can identify the different flow patterns reattachment or vortex shedding which are in convective instability and absolute instability respectively in the former the shear layers are elongated chains of k h vorticity which develop basically independently and lack of mutual interaction in the latter significant momentum exchange between the shear layers occurs leading to an increase in the magnitude of rss for a cylinder undergoing vortex shedding e g cy 2 at α 0 or all the three cylinders at d o d 5 besides the two large scale clusters of rss there are two additional small scale clusters of opposite signed rss immediately upstream of the main clusters a phenomenon that is evident for the standalone cylinder as shown in fig 2 b a similar feature has been reported by dong et al 2006 on a standalone cylinder based on piv measurements and direct numerical simulations this feature can be used to indicate whether vortex shedding occurs or not moreover when vortex shedding takes place the magnitude of rss around that cylinder would approach or even exceed the corresponding value of 0 067 for the standalone cylinder e g cy 1 or cy 2 in the case of d o d α 5 10 the elevated rss level is likely due to the acceleration of the flow through the gaps between the cylinders in the array therefore the ensemble averaged statistical quantities can provide useful information about the dynamic flow features such as vortex shedding and flow interference without inspecting the large amount of piv data snapshot by snapshot 3 2 vortex shedding frequencies the effects of d o d and α on vortex shedding frequency can be evaluated by performing power spectral analysis of the instantaneous lift on each cylinder fig 8 a c presents the results for d o d 3 2 at α 0 15 and 30 respectively at α 0 both cy 1 and cy 3 show the lack of well defined peaks which is consistent with flow pattern observed for this case i e in impingement regime without vortex shedding cy 2 however exhibits a relatively well defined peak at st 0 2 which corresponds to periodic vortex shedding as can be observed in the instantaneous flow fields when α increases spectral peaks albeit broad banded begin to occur on the two cylinders in staggered configuration which are identifiable on cy 3 only at α 15 and then on both cylinders at α 30 this is attributed to the flow pattern that the shear layers emanated from cy 1 would induce flow separation and hence vortex shedding from the downstream cylinder cy 3 on the other hand the spectral peaks of cy 2 become attenuated with increasing α due to the increased interference with cy 3 each of the two upstream cylinders cy 1 or cy 2 is characterized with one spectral peak at st 0 25 whereas the downstream cylinder cy 3 is associated with two distinct values of strouhal number namely one at st 0 25 and the other at st 0 09 similar two peak phenomenon has been reported for two cylinders in staggered arrangement sumner et al 2000 or closely spaced four cylinder array e g lam et al 2003 wang et al 2013 the peaks at st 0 25 and 0 09 are associated with vortex shedding from the upstream and downstream cylinders respectively the explanations are as follows as shown in fig 4 when α is relatively large α 20 or 30 the flow entering in between cy 1 and cy 2 diverge at a considerable angle resulting in an obviously narrower wake behind either cy 1 or cy 2 and wider wake behind cy 3 which can be easily appreciated by the mean recirculation patterns in fig 6 and the rss distribution in fig 7 for this case it is well known that the width of the wake is closely linked with the vortex shedding frequency from the cylinder the broader the wake the lower the vortex shedding frequency and vice versa sumner et al 1999 therefore the upstream and downstream cylinders respectively have higher and lower st than that of st 0 2 for a standalone cylinder since the three cylinders are in proximity to each other and cy 3 is located at a relatively downstream position vortices shed from the upstream cylinder cy 1 or cy 2 can have footprint on cy 3 resulting in the 2 peak behavior in its lift power spectra this is consistent with the finding reported by han et al 2018 that the three cylinder array exhibits galloping phenomenon particularly at p d α 4 30 this 2 peak behavior needs to be paid attention in designing multi cylinder system to prevent or minimize resonance by keeping the natural frequencies of the system away from all possible vortex shedding frequencies a similar 2 peak behavior is observed on cy 3 for the case of d o d 4 but at α 30 only as shown in fig 9 this is plausible because the flow interference among the cylinders is reduced with the increase in spacing in addition it is noteworthy to highlight the values of high and low st which are 0 21 and 0 12 respectively as compared to the case of d o d 3 2 for which st 0 25 and 0 09 both values are closer to the baseline value of 0 2 for a standalone cylinder implying reduced flow interference among the cylinders in addition nearly all the cylinders except for cy 1 at α 0 display well defined spectral peaks with much higher amplitude which symbolizes the strength of vortex shedding than that of d o d 3 2 indicating the occurrence of vortex shedding fig 10 shows that when d o d increases to 5 each cylinder exhibits a sole identical frequency at st 0 2 this indicates that the interference among the cylinders has decreased to such a level that each cylinder is undergoing periodic vortex shedding since cy 3 is located downstream either in the tandem arrangement when α 0 or in the staggered arrangement when α 0 it is more or less subjected to impingement of vortices shed from the upstream cylinder s as a consequence the amplitude of the spectral speak is always higher than that of the other two cylinders 3 3 hydrodynamic force coefficients fig 11 13 show the statistical force coefficients including mean and rms drag lift coefficients c d c d c l and c l on each cylinder versus d o d for α 0 15 and 30 respectively in these figures the values of the mean drag and rms lift coefficients measured for the standalone cylinder under the same flow condition c d 0 1 2 and c l 0 0 14 are added for comparison purpose for the case of α 0 the mean drag coefficient of cy 2 c d 2 maintains at about 1 2 invariant to cylinder spacing which is close to the corresponding value of a standalone cylinder c d 0 in comparison relatively low mean drag coefficients are found for the pair of cylinders in tandem cy 1 and cy 3 c d 1 is nearly constant about 1 0 whereas c d 3 is even lower and varies with spacing at d o d 3 2 or 4 c d 3 is about 0 5 but then increases sharply to about 0 8 at d o d 5 fig 11 a this sharp increase in mean drag coefficient is associated with the flow transition from reattachment regime to vortex impinging regime 1st row of fig 4 note that at d o d 3 2 c d 3 0 5 is slightly higher than the corresponding value of 0 3 for the downstream cylinder in tandem arrangement at similar spacing wang et al 2015 this is attributed to the presence of cy 2 which causes usl 1 to bend downward and reattach on the leading face of cy 3 whereas for two cylinders in tandem arrangement the downstream cylinder is largely engulfed in the wake of the upstream one the effect of flow transition is also evident on the rms drag coefficient of cy 3 c d 3 fig 11 a and rms lift coefficient of cy 3 c l 3 fig 11 b both of which exhibit an abrupt increase from d o d 4 to 5 at this incidence angle the mean lift on each cylinder is non zero due to flow asymmetry particularly cy 3 at small spacing for example c l 3 0 6 at d o d 3 2 fig 11 b which agrees with the downward deflection of usl 1 and reattachment on the leading surface of cy 3 due to the presence of cy 2 see fig 4 with increasing spacing and hence decreasing interference from cy 2 the magnitude of c l 3 reduces to c l 3 0 2 at d o d 4 and 5 and finally to c l 3 0 at d o d 6 indicative of diminishing of proximity effects from cy 2 this trend is consistent with previous observations in the mean velocity vector fields 1st row of fig 6 that the upper shear layer from cy 1 usl 1 becomes more straightened with the increase in d o d fig 12 a shows that when α increases to 15 the mean and rms drag coefficients of the three cylinders display roughly the same variation trends with reference to d o d as those at α 0 however because cy 3 is exposed to the oncoming flow to some extent the mean drag coefficient at small spacing is considerably higher than that at α 0 for example c d 3 0 9 at d o d 3 2 vs 0 5 for α 0 at the same spacing on the other hand the downward deflection of usl 1 is more obvious see 2nd row of fig 4 or fig 6 resulting in c l 3 0 for all values of d o d fig 12 b when α increases to 30 the flow attains symmetry about x axis with cy 1 and cy 2 located upstream in side by side arrangement therefore the values of c d c d and c l for the two upstream cylinders cy 1 and cy 2 are basically equal fig 13 for the downstream cylinder cy 3 the mean drag coefficient is slightly lower at small spacing c d 3 1 0 and 1 1 at d o d 3 2 and 4 respectively but then quickly attains the value for the standalone cylinder implying that flow interference among the cylinders is limited to small spacing cases according to fig 13 b at small spacings c l 1 0 and c l 2 0 suggesting that there is a net repulsive force between the pair of upstream cylinders similar phenomenon has been observed for the two side by side cylinders sumner et al 1999 and for a four cylinder array in inline arrangement wang et al 2013 in addition since cy 3 is located at a relatively downstream position it is more or less subjected to the effects of shear layers emanated from upstream cylinders therefore the rms lift coefficient is always higher than that of the two upstream cylinders particularly when vortex shedding occurs from the upstream cylinders correspondingly the transverse vibration amplitude of cy 3 is consistently higher than that of cy 1 cy 2 or a standalone cylinder as shown by wang et al 2013 for a three cylinder array undergoing fiv in both α 15 and α 30 cases the value of d o d at which flow transition occurs becomes smaller that is at d o d 3 2 4 for α 15 or 30 as compared to that d o d 4 5 for α 0 this phenomenon is in agreement with the piv results that vortex shedding from cy 1 indeed occurs at d o d 4 for α 15 or 30 whereas it does not occur until d o d 5 for α 0 this indicates that for a given spacing the increase of α is beneficial for the onset of vortex shedding to illustrate the effects of cylinder array orientation with respect to the oncoming flow fig 14 provides the variations of the averaged force coefficients c d c l c d and c l of the three cylinders versus α at different values of d o d together with the corresponding values for the standalone cylinder as the reference as shown in fig 14 a the averaged drag coefficient c d generally increases with both incidence angle and spacing ratio when α is small the downstream cylinder cy 3 might be completely or partially located in the wake of the upstream cylinder cy 1 and hence is subject to a lower drag as α increases all the cylinders become more exposed to oncoming flow leading to the increase in c d it can be seen that the values of c d for large spacing d o d 5 or 6 would approach that of the standalone cylinder c d 0 at α 25 this agrees with the flow visualization results that flow interference becomes minimal in the cases of d o d 5 and α 30 for small spacing d o d 3 2 or 4 however the values of c d are always lower than c d 0 which is due to the flow interference among the cylinders therefore the value of the averaged drag coefficient c d can be used as an indicator to evaluate the severity of interference among the cylinders in the array fig 14 b indicates that the mean lift coefficient c l is negative for almost all cases indicating that the cylinder array is experiencing a mean downward force fig 14 c shows that the rms drag coefficient c d for each d o d attains a peak at moderate α 5 20 in terms of the maximum value of c d one can appreciate the difference between the small and large spacing cases which are respectively lower and higher than that of the standalone cylinder c d 0 similarly the averaged rms lift coefficient displays different behaviors depending on whether the spacing is small or large as shown in fig 14 d at small spacing d o d 3 2 or 4 c l is always less than c l 0 and does not vary much with α at large spacing d o d 5 or 6 by contrast c l is higher than c l 0 and decrease with increasing α within the range considered these phenomena are in accordance with the piv results that as d o d increases the flow around the cylinders experiences the transition from steady reattachment regime to unsteady vortex shedding regime the latter is associated with much higher fluctuating lift particularly for the cylinder located in the wake of another one see for example cy 3 in the case of α 0 and d o d 5 or 6 in this case c l 3 is extraordinarily high which is about 0 6 see fig 11 b or about 6 times higher than that of 0 1 for the other two cylinders located relatively upstream the extraordinarily high value of c l 3 is due to impingement of vortices shed from cy 1 on the leading face of cy 3 besides the fluctuating lift generated by vortex shedding from cy 3 itself as α increases cy 3 gradually deviates from the wake of cy 1 and becomes more exposed to the oncoming flow resulting in a decrease in the impingement effects from cy 1 therefore the averaged rms lift coefficient c l is decreasing with the increase in α fig 14 d also shows that for a given α the value of c l for d o d 6 is consistently lower than that for d o d 5 or closer to that of the standalone cylinder c l 0 implying that flow interference among the cylinders decreases with spacing it is expected that when d o d is sufficiently large c l at α 30 would approach c l 0 4 concluding remarks the effects of varying spacing ratio d o d 3 2 6 or p d 2 8 5 2 and incidence angle α 0 30 on the flow around a three cylinder array arranged in equilateral triangular configuration under a subcritical reynolds number re 8000 are investigated based on detailed measurements of flow field using particle image velocimetry piv and hydrodynamic forces on each cylinder using piezoelectric load cell the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the flow structure is strongly dependent on both spacing ratio and incidence angle resulting in a variety of flow patterns over the d o d α parameter space considered with reference to d o d the flow patterns could be broadly divided into two types namely shear layer reattachment regime and vortex shedding regime at small d o d 4 and large d o d 5 spacings respectively the effects of α are more complex since they are also dependent on the value of d o d when the cylinder spacing is small the flow experiences a transition from reattachment regime to induced separation regime and finally synchronized vortex shedding regime at small α 0 moderate α 10 20 and large α 30 respectively when the spacing is large on the other hand the three corresponding regimes are 2 sided impinging 1 sided impinging and independent vortex shedding at small moderate and large α respectively 2 the effects of flow interference among the cylinders due to the variation in cylinder spacing and incidence angle are also appreciable in the mean velocity vector field u v and the distributions of reynolds shear stress rss with corresponding measurement data for a standalone cylinder at the same reynolds number provided for comparison purpose notably upon flow transition from reattachment regime to vortex impinging regime the distributions of rss become more squeezed in the streamwise direction towards the cylinder base with significantly elevated level of rss when vortex shedding occurs the rss around that cylinder approaches that of the standalone cylinder in terms of both spatial distribution and magnitude 3 the different flow patterns over the d o d α parameter space are also evident in the power spectra of the fluctuating lift coefficient on each cylinder at large spacing d o d 5 that lies in vortex shedding regime the three cylinders in the array always exhibit a sole identical frequency at st 0 2 at small spacing d o d 4 an identical frequency is observed for the two upstream cylinders cy 1 and cy 2 once vortex shedding occurs the downstream cylinder cy 3 however displays different features depending on the value of α i e one and two peak modes for small and large α respectively the high and low frequency components at st 0 2 and st 0 2 respectively in the two peak mode are attributed to the vortex shedding from the upstream cylinder s and the downstream cylinder itself respectively 4 moreover the effects of varying d o d and α are discernible in the mean and rms drag lift coefficients on the three cylinders either individually or as a whole group when the flow undergoes transition from reattachment regime to vortex impinging regime the downstream cylinder cy 3 experiences a sharp increase in the mean drag coefficient i e from c d 3 0 5 to 0 8 also the averaged mean drag coefficient of the cylinder array approaches c d 0 1 2 for the standalone cylinder only when both the cylinder spacing and incidence angle are large enough d o d 5 and α 25 the mean lift coefficients on the array and particularly on cy 3 to be considerably negative up to c l 3 0 6 over the small to moderate α range which is consistent with the flow asymmetry about x axis such as the downward deflection of usl 1 and reattachment on the leading surface of cy 3 the downstream cylinder in the array i e cy 3 generally experiences a lower mean drag but assume remarkably higher rms drag and lift

21556,the beibu gulf surrounded by multiple countries north of the south china sea has numerous oil platforms around it putting it at a high susceptibility for oil spills oil spill models play an important role in susceptibility assessment by estimating oil spill trajectories in this gulf these trajectories are affected by factors that vary with time on a regional or basin scale however these factors are typically assumed to be constant in most oil spill models their determination is challenging due to the influence of current dynamics tidal cycles and other related environmental parameters particular attention should be paid to the role of wind in the regional parameterisation of oil spill models since it is particularly sensitive to the coastal characteristics the drifter data in the beibu gulf provide an effective way to evaluate the local parameters this paper proposes a regional oil spill susceptibility assessment ossa method for the beibu gulf the assessment makes use of an oil spill model whose wind induced factor is parameterised using the drifter data results were validated using data from the weizhou oilfield oil spill accident in august 2008 combined with the local geographical attributes an enhanced oil spill susceptibility map of the beibu gulf is presented which more accurately describes the seasonal characteristics of the susceptibility in this area keywords south china sea beibu gulf regional parameterisation susceptibility assessment oil spill modelling remote sensing 1 introduction located in the northwestern part of the south china sea the beibu gulf has an area of 129 300 km2 and an offshore bathymetry averaging 38 m it is a natural semi enclosed bay along the boundary of several provinces of china and vietnam since the establishment of the china asean free trade area acfta it has become an indispensable trade and business route in southeast asia and the world the beibu gulf is rich in oil resources that are estimated to be between 2 3 and 300 million tons chen et al 2015 so far countries along the beibu gulf have drilled more than 1380 oil wells and an annual oil production of 360 million barrel of oil equivalents are record there wu et al 2017 petroleum extraction involves the use of 132 5 km of submarine oil and gas pipelines with a total length of 198 km still under construction although the exploitation of this resource has promoted the growth of local economies it carries with it the significant susceptibility of oil spills during oil extraction storage and transportation as evidenced in recent oil spills of offshore drilling platforms such as in the gulf of mexico and 19 3 in penglai bay serious marine oil spill disasters not only have the potential to cause widespread damage to marine ecosystems and wildlife habitats but also lasting damage to the economy around confined maritime routes in the form of impacts to fisheries and tourism alves et al 2014 2015 according to the reports of the guangxi government lu 2018 oil spills in the beibu gulf occur almost every year mostly due to illegal discharges and minor technical problems in ships this indicates that there is indeed a high oil spill susceptibility in the beibu gulf a scientific and accurate susceptibility assessment of such oil spills can aid a community s prevention and readiness to better manage emergency plans and minimise economic damage lan et al 2015 meanwhile some researches have considered the impact of seasonally varying population distributions in the assessment of oil spill susceptibility so as to minimise ecosystem damage helle et al 2020 however a fundamental knowledge gap still exists regarding the assessment of the oil spill susceptibility of the beibu gulf as well as local environmental impacts oil spill models have proved to be an effective means of conducting oil susceptibility assessments after the first oil spill model was developed by the us government doi in 1975 several kinds of oil susceptibility models such as oilmap and medslick zodiatis et al 2017a gnome noaa the osis system warren spring laboratory bmt ceemaid ltd norway oilpill stat system and oscar oil spill risk analysis etc have been developed to predict oil spill trajectory and fate under actual environmental conditions spaulding 2017 combined with atmospheric and hydrodynamic data sets the models could make a significant contribution to oil spill susceptibility analyses due to their effective prediction of the transport fate and weathering processes of oil slicks coupled with a clear understanding of the mobilisation of resources management decisions in pre planning emergency response could be more effective and therefore reduce the negative effects of oil spills on the marine environment el fadel et al 2012 alves et al 2015 2016 nevertheless it is challenging to ensure the accuracy of the simulated trajectories and fate of oil slicks in offshore areas such as the beibu gulf this is because regional parameters associated with local bathymetric and climatic characteristics such as wind current and tidal cycles are more sensitive and vary with time relative to seafloor depth alves et al 2015 2016 in order to improve the performance of oil spill models for the gulf of mexico price 2006 focused on correcting the current parameter of the oil spill susceptibility analysis model by analysing the drifter track lee et al 2020 concluded that tidal current and waves are important factors in forecasting oil spill diffusion zodiatis et al 2017a b based on the fact that spilled oil moves vertically on the water s surface by wave and tide they established the swan model to parameterise these same tides and waves they compile their results as factors in the oil particle model random walk rw in a three dimensional oil spill model which accurately predicted the hebei spirit oil spill lee et al 2020 thus oil spill accidents mentioned above reveal that the regional parameterisation current parameter tidal current and waves have significant effect on the improvement of accuracy of the simulated trajectories besides remote sensing data current parameters water depth and tidal cycles mentioned above wind also plays an important role in the oil spill model wind has been established as one of the most important factors for the movement of an oil slick at the top of the water column geng et al 2016 brenner has pointed out that prevailing winds leads to potential susceptibility of cross border pollution transport from oil spills in small semi enclosed basins brenner 2020 in existing oil spill susceptibility analyses uncertainty errors are the main factors affecting the accuracy of the assessment sepp neves et al 2015 according to the special basin scale of the beibu gulf wind is the main source of uncertainty error bi 2012 demonstrates the importance of wind induced factors in oil spill movements for this reason a more accurate wind parameter is necessary bi et al 2012 le hénaff 2012 concluded on the importance of wind in oil spill movement boufadel 2014 quantitatively studied the influence of wind power on oil spill movement and found that a 6 difference in wind velocity would lead to a significant difference in oil spill movement most of the current oil spill models use correctional wind experience parameters which may lead to differences in forecast results zodiatis et al 2017a b at present it is difficult to determine an accurate wind induced factor for oil spill prediction yu et al 2016b demonstrates that due to drift and changes in the marine environment the wind induced factor in the oil spill models may not be constant furthermore the wind in the beibu gulf is affected by monsoons typhoons and seasonal change as a result the regional parameterisation is important for oil spill susceptibility assessment in the beibu gulf and accurate wind induced factor is necessary to improve this assessment accuracy it is also important to note that susceptibility assessment is not only limited to the oil spill model but is also related to coastal vulnerability yu et al 2018 this paper proposes a regional oil spill susceptibility analyse method for the beibu gulf it provides a method of wind parameterisation for the oil spill model and establishes an accurate oil spill trajectory prediction model in addition a monthly susceptibility map suitable for the beibu gulf was generated to improve the prevention of oil spill in this area the oil spill situation in weizhou oilfield in the beibu gulf is simulated and monthly susceptibility maps are compared to the actual event in order to determine accuracy of the prediction results 2 data and methods 2 1 oceanographic data this study made use of wind data from the ecmwf european centre for medium range weather forecasts for interim reanalysis data it has the grid resolution of 1 8 and temporal resolution of 1 day which setting the 12 00 data per day as the average data for that day the surface currents are modelled using hycom hybrid coordinate ocean model with a spatial resolution of 1 12 and a time resolution of 6 h the vertical resolution ranges from 2 to 1000 m with a total of 40 layers the hycom data contains the sea surface height current thermohaline temperature salinity i4oilspill is a combination of the eulerian lagrangian model and eulerian cycle model with the presumption that only turbulent dispersion along the vertical direction was considered the i4oilspill simulates 3d oil transport and fates by dividing the water body into several horizontal layers and each layer is regarded as an independent horizontal plane like sea surface it has proved its regional adaptability in bohai sea china yu et al 2016a the drifter data used in this paper was obtained from the noaa s atlantic oceanographic and meteorological laboratory aoml and the data within the latitude and longitude of the beibu gulf were selected with a time resolution of 6 h 2 2 method for predicting oil spill movement in oil spill predictions the eulerian lagrangian transport model shows that the transport of oil slicks at sea surface are affected by currents and wind in parallel the transformation process demonstrates the life cycle of the oil spill by tracking the process of oil spill transport diffusion evaporation dissolution and emulsification amongst other processes yu et al 2016b in this study the regional parameterisation of wind induced drift factor of the beibu gulf is used in the i4oilspill oil model the i4oilspill simulates oil surface transport controlled by current and winds through the input of data on the spill wind sea surface temperature and three dimensional currents the i4oilspill calculated the coordinate position of the spill for several hours and then for several days see fig 2 oil spills in the marine environment are mostly driven by surface currents and the upper portion of oil spill is directly affected by the wind according to the general eulerian lagrangian equation the oil spill on the surface is dispersed into oil spill particles by turbulence which is parameterised by random walk models apart from advection and diffusion displacement the oil spill particles will also undergo physical and chemical changes known as the weathering processes evaporation emulsification sedimentation adhesion to the coast zodiatis et al 2017a b the overall process is shown in fig 3 the i4oilspill includes the correct representation of the currents and winds in the horizontal displacement of the eulerian lagrangian trajectory model and takes into account the impact of stokes drift in order to clarify the relationship between the eulerian lagrangian particle method and oil concentration models it is assumed that the composition of oil spill particles does not affect their hydrodynamics and transportation in water though the oil type has important implications to the way it moved across a water body and also affected the volumes of oil emulsified and sunk in sea water alves et al 2016 zodiatis et al 2017a b focused on the influence of wind parameterisation on the oil spill model the oil type parameters in the oil spill movement equation is simplified in this study the following equation 1 represent the weathering process and equation 2 represents the movement of the oil spill 1 c 1 t j 1 m r j c 1 2 c t k c 1 u c 1 c 1 represents the oil spill concentration in the weathering part and c is the oil spill concentration driven by advection and turbulence k is the turbulent fluctuation tensor of the turbulent diffusion u represents the depth averaged current velocity for the water column including waves wind and water which are the most important forces affecting the surface movement of oil spill r j x c 1 x t t represents the weathering process it should correspond to the actual calculation process through the input data the model calculates the process of the transformation to obtain the result of equation 1 it defines the oil slick state variable and solves equation 2 by applying lagrangian particle model the spread of oil is mainly determined by a large scale flow field the movement of any oil spill can be expressed in terms of equation 2 taking the surface oil spill as an example the transport process of oil particles can be expressed as follows 3 d x k t u c x k y k 0 t u w x k y k t u s x k y k t d t d x k t u c represents eulerian current velocity which is formed by the force of buoyancy and is generated by the prediction or analysis data of ocean numerical models u w hereinafter referred to as local wind speed term is a part of velocity correction which is necessary due to the errors in simulating the wind driving the average current called the ekman current zodiatis et al 2017a b u s hereafter known as the wave velocity term is the velocity of the water in the form of wave or the velocity caused by the stokes drift the surface currents can be parameterised into an equation for wind intensity and the angle between winds and currents as follows 4 u w α w x cos β w y sin β v w α w x sin β w y cos β where w x and w y are respectively the wind speed and its component at a height of 10 m above the surface α is called drift factor which does not include the impact of strokes drift β is called drift angle due to the difference in time and space the flow condition of ocean current differs and sometimes the wind speed and direction also vary given this when oil spills occur the movement from the oil spill centre differs in terms of place and time most models have a drift factor of about 3 and drift angle from 0 to 25 al rabeh et al 2000 by comparing the actual wind speed and wind direction of the whole year in one of the data sets the linear regression equation 5 is obtained 5 α 1 n v w i v w v d r v d r v w i v w 2 adapting to the region we choose the beibu gulf 107 e 110 e 19 n 22 n drifter data in order to extract the velocity u and v among them the v w i is wind speed component v w is the average of the wind speed v d r is a drifter s velocity components v d r is the drifter s average speed n is the number of the wind drifter data set a total of 2800 sections of the wind drifter data set were used to compute α creating a 0 25 0 25 grid based on the monthly data with a resolution of 0 1 m s in the horizontal direction at the same latitude and longitude the wind speed v w i and drifter speed v d r were screened to obtain a large number of v w i v d r value pairs for example the least square method was used for linear regression to obtain the drift factor α 3 85 suitable for the beibu gulf area in year 2008 in order to display the results intuitively finite element meshes were used in the data processing with a resolution of approximately 0 001 0 001 they were used to draw the oil spill concentration and each grid represented tons per square kilometre in terms of the initial setting of oil platforms 24 typical platforms in the beibu gulf weizhou oilfield were selected with the same accident probability take one of the oil platforms as an example first the oil spill is discretized into different numbers of oil particles starting from the set leaking time the oil spill leaks according to the preset coordinates of the oil platform based on the current coordinates of the wind and current velocity the drift factor α is calculated equation 5 the velocity of each oil spill particle is calculated as per equation 4 based on the predicted time length of the oil spill several oil spill scenarios in different states were calculated and displayed on the output graph in each scenario under the different conditions cucco et al 2012 de dominicis et al 2013a 2013b olita et al 2012 the simulation of the oil spill dispersion trajectory lasted for 10 days in the one year simulation cycle the first 20 days of each month were used as the start date of each cycle in this way 240 oil spill scenarios in different conditions were obtained from the one year data set we have overlaid daily oil spill track of each month to get 12 months oil spill track of 2008 2 3 the beibu gulf oil spill susceptibility map based on coastal utilisation the susceptibility of oil spill refers to the possibility of an oil spill occurring and the impact of the oil spill on the surrounding environment french mccay et al 2008 the susceptibility index of offshore oil spill should be operable scientific and representative liu et al 2010 combined with the regional

parameters have a resolution of approximately 0 001 0 001 where x y represents the coordinates of each mesh the beibu gulf coast is utilised by the community for many purposes as shown in fig 1 these sectors have different economic importance the impact of oil pollution on these sectors of the economy is difficult to quantify through access to public data relevant information on the surrounding

marine functional zoning etc the pollution impact of these coastal lands i was ranked by combining the coastal utilisation in these cities such coastal utilisation is defined as 1 to 10 scale on a

regions the impact is primarily affected by the ecological pressure factors ecological resilience has a significant negative correlation with the assessment of ecological environment vulnerability the worse the ecological resilience the stronger the ecological sensitivity and the higher the ecological pressure the closer the value i is to 1 and vice versa 3 results 3 1 oil spill trajectory prediction each oil spill simulation lasted for 10 days from january 1 2008 to december 20 2008 the colour bar of the image indicates the concentration of the oil spill tons per square kilometre it can be inferred that oil spills in the wind and the current usually in winter dec jan and feb tend to move towards the west side of the beibu gulf oil spill location in the spring mar apr and may the oil spill showed a trend of moving towards the northwest it distributes in the north of the beibu gulf meanwhile a small amount is located in the northwest in summer jun jul and aug the oil spill tends to move to the east of the beibu gulf and in the autumn sep oct and nov it tends to move toward the south and southwest due to the high wind speed in october november and december most of the oil spills touched the shore after ten days and the amount of oil still on the sea surface was relatively less the oil concentration in the oil spills during the winter was high throughout the year averaging around 0 5 t km2 while the oil concentration in the summer was low averaging around 0 2 t km2 3 2 susceptibility index calculation the oil spill susceptibility index proposed in this paper is a dimensionless index obtained by weighing the track and concentration of oil spill predicted by the model with the vulnerability of coastal land calculation for the year s oil spill susceptibility index diagram and the size of the susceptibility index can be reflective of the year s oil spill susceptibility index which ranges from 0 3 to 1 according to the actual size of the susceptibility index the beibu gulf region has four high susceptibility areas zone 1 zone 2 zone 3 zone 4 see figs 4 and 5 fang chenggang city in guangxi province zone 1 has a high level of oil spill susceptibility throughout the year about 0 8 1 in the winter december january and february oil spills mostly occurred near fang chenggang city zone 1 in spring mar apr and may the susceptibility of oil spill in qinzhou city zone 2 of guangxi province is elevated 0 5 0 8 in the summer jun jul and aug oil spills concentrated near the beach zone 4 of beihai city of guangxi province 0 9 1 in some months the susceptibility index near the west coast zone 3 of zhanjiang city of guangdong province is higher 0 9 1 4 discussion the beibu gulf is located in the subtropical monsoon climate zone due to its unique geographical location it has a unique climate type with an average annual water temperature of up to 24 5 c summer is affected by tropical ocean winds mostly southwest wind affected by the cold air from the mainland the northeast prevailing wind frequent typhoons occur in winter about five times a year on average offshore oil spills are harmful and difficult to mitigate tourism resources and fishery resources are abundant along the beibu gulf coast if an oil spill occurs it will cause a huge blow to the coastal economy therefore in this area taking the environmental characteristics of the beibu gulf into account is for the optimisation the oil spill model the results of this study preliminarily show that a more accurate susceptibility warning can be obtained by adding the regional parameterisation of wind induced drift factor to oil spill susceptibility model it needs to be mentioned that the results obtained in the experiment are preliminary results which have certain reference value for the prevention and emergency of actual oil spill events 4 1 seasonal susceptibility map of the beibu gulf the oil spill susceptibility map of the beibu gulf can be divided into four parts according to the seasons a in spring oil spills are generally in high concentration and susceptibility is in high level the high susceptibility areas are mainly concentrated in the northern and north western parts of the beibu gulf b in summer the oil spill trajectory shifted eastward and high oil spill susceptibility areas mainly in the northeast and east parts of the beibu gulf due to the decline in oil spill concentration oil spill susceptibility was mainly determined by coastal vulnerability and the oil spill susceptibility index was low because of high temperature the shape of the oil spill changed from a block shape to a banded shape c in fall the area of oil spill decreased significantly and it mainly moved westward because the diffusion area is small the oil spill susceptibility during this season was mainly affected by the oil spill concentration d in winter the low temperature slows down the spread of oil spill and the area of oil spill decreases significantly the oil spill totally gathers in the north western part of the beibu gulf forming irregular block shapes in summary the seasonal variation of the beibu gulf leads to changes in water temperature and wind field thus changing the level of oil spill susceptibility in various regions in winter and spring the high susceptibility areas of the beibu gulf are concentrated in pearl bay which in the northwest and the peninsula of beihai city which in the north in the fall the concentration of oil spills is low and in winter it is concentrated in zhanjiang city which in the east of the beibu gulf the susceptibility of oil spills in the spring and summer seasons is significantly higher than in the autumn and winter seasons because the wind is smooth and oil spills spread faster at higher temperatures by comparing the result of oil spill susceptibilitys in different seasons we can take emergency measures accordingly for example spring and summer oil spills are banded shape which increases the length of shoreline spills and that needs for more extensive emergency measures to further analysis the susceptibility of oil spills in the beibu gulf four high susceptibility zones in the beibu gulf are provided 4 2 high susceptibility zones in the beibu gulf the four high susceptibility zones along the beibu gulf are focused on fishing nature conservation and salt production faced with high susceptibility areas the government should try to avoid setting up oil platforms in these areas if a platform has been set up in the susceptibility area additional measures such as oil pipeline reinforcement and other measures to reduce the possibility of oil spill must be undertaken as can be seen from fig 5 the low susceptibility index is distributed among the unused water bodies and port areas in the central and western part of the beibu gulf although the susceptibility index is smaller in low susceptibility areas the government should still put an emphasis on safety inspections however this research still has a degree of uncertainty for instance the calculation of susceptibility index i only considers the impact of pollution and a complex index system is adopted to evaluate the final susceptibility resulting in a more appropriate and complete solution if coordinated with local authorities ecological and socio economic sensitivities can be considered so that more accurate indicators can be created for example coastal areas should be accurately assessed with regard to market economy it is worth noting that the response and resilience of local governments to oil spills also has an important impact on the susceptibility index 4 3 policy implications for the high susceptibility area it s necessary for the government to implement appropriate policies for oil spilling these strategies require decision makers to make a balance between ecological issues and economic development such as keeping new oil platforms away from zone 3 4 in summer and 1 in winter in order to take cleaning measures after the accident preparing common apparatuses such as booms skimmers dredges and pumping vessels is important and it could be necessary to take severe measures in order to address the problem before the accident s at national and international levels it will effectively reduce the impact of oil spill accidents 4 4 validation of the oil spill forecast this paper demonstrates the effectiveness of oil spill results in two ways through the use of drifter data and data from the actual oil spill accident 4 4 1 validation of oil spill trajectory by drifter data based on the global drifter data and the coordinate range of the beibu gulf 107 e 110 e 19 n 22 n 4147 drifter data in this area were selected according to the statistics from national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa drifter data are mainly distributed in 2005 and 2006 by the atlantic oceanographic and meteorological laboratory aoml affiliated with noaa due to the time distribution being relatively sparse the may 2006 drifter data was selected as it was more complete it had a total of 3108 drifter points the drifter starting position was selected as the initial point of the oil spill and the drifter itself was used as a tracer of oil spill validation results show that the drifter correlated with the oil spill trajectories the results are shown in fig 6 4 4 2 validation of oil spill trajectory by actual oil spill accident taking the weizhou oilfield oil spill accident in august 2008 as an example the validity and feasibility of the algorithm were verified three crude oil spills occurred in the weizhou oilfield of china s national offshore oil corporation on august 16 23 and 27 2008 on the morning of september 3 a satellite remote sense monitoring the weizhou island sea area found a large area covered by the oil spill on the morning of september 4 the cnooc aircraft in weizhou island 12 nautical miles southwest of the sea also found about 10 km2 of oil pollution in september the spill affected the entire coastal region of guangxi and large amounts of black crude oil were found on beaches in the beihai city the i4oilspill was used to simulate the oil spill track of 24 oil platforms in weizhou oilfield of the beibu gulf in 2008 and the possible high susceptibility oil spill area was identified it was found that the high susceptibility oil spill area in august was located in beihai city which corresponds with the practical situation see fig 7 5 conclusions in recent years the south china sea has become a hot spot of economic development the number of offshore oil drilling platforms near the beibu gulf make it a high susceptibility area therefore it is necessary to evaluate the susceptibility of oil spills in the beibu gulf in this study the unique regional parameterisation of wind induced drift factor was determined this factor considers the influence of regional wind in the beibu gulf compared with the experienced parameters in the traditional oil spill mode drifter data is used to reduce the random influence of environment parameters in oil spill simulation in addition the oil spill susceptibility analyse method which uses this factor obtained precisely prediction result in the beibu gulf the factor is verified by using the data of oil spill accident in weizhou oilfield and the trajectory of drifter during the same period furthermore taking note of the oil spill movement and the vulnerability of coastal land a susceptibility map of the oil spill combined with regional characteristics of the beibu gulf was drawn meanwhile the regional susceptibility of the beibu gulf in different seasons was evaluated by assessing the regional distribution of risks in the beibu gulf in different seasons authorities can enact seasonal policies and increase the probability of avoiding the susceptibility of oil spills as for environmental protection the beibu gulf has a large number of fishery tourism resources economic development in the area primarily relies on the stability of the natural environment since the china asean free trade area was established the beibu gulf has become the focus of world attention meanwhile there is an increase in the exploitation of natural resources in this region the susceptibility map can ensure the stable development of regional economy it can be used to better implement the environmental protection policy in the beibu gulf so as to improve the stability of regional economic credit authorship contribution statement fangjie yu conceptualization methodology project

21556,the beibu gulf surrounded by multiple countries north of the south china sea has numerous oil platforms around it putting it at a high susceptibility for oil spills oil spill models play an important role in susceptibility assessment by estimating oil spill trajectories in this gulf these trajectories are affected by factors that vary with time on a regional or basin scale however these factors are typically assumed to be constant in most oil spill models their determination is challenging due to the influence of current dynamics tidal cycles and other related environmental parameters particular attention should be paid to the role of wind in the regional parameterisation of oil spill models since it is particularly sensitive to the coastal characteristics the drifter data in the beibu gulf provide an effective way to evaluate the local parameters this paper proposes a regional oil spill susceptibility assessment ossa method for the beibu gulf the assessment makes use of an oil spill model whose wind induced factor is parameterised using the drifter data results were validated using data from the weizhou oilfield oil spill accident in august 2008 combined with the local geographical attributes an enhanced oil spill susceptibility map of the beibu gulf is presented which more accurately describes the seasonal characteristics of the susceptibility in this area keywords south china sea beibu gulf regional parameterisation susceptibility assessment oil spill modelling remote sensing 1 introduction located in the northwestern part of the south china sea the beibu gulf has an area of 129 300 km2 and an offshore bathymetry averaging 38 m it is a natural semi enclosed bay along the boundary of several provinces of china and vietnam since the establishment of the china asean free trade area acfta it has become an indispensable trade and business route in southeast asia and the world the beibu gulf is rich in oil resources that are estimated to be between 2 3 and 300 million tons chen et al 2015 so far countries along the beibu gulf have drilled more than 1380 oil wells and an annual oil production of 360 million barrel of oil equivalents are record there wu et al 2017 petroleum extraction involves the use of 132 5 km of submarine oil and gas pipelines with a total length of 198 km still under construction although the exploitation of this resource has promoted the growth of local economies it carries with it the significant susceptibility of oil spills during oil extraction storage and transportation as evidenced in recent oil spills of offshore drilling platforms such as in the gulf of mexico and 19 3 in penglai bay serious marine oil spill disasters not only have the potential to cause widespread damage to marine ecosystems and wildlife habitats but also lasting damage to the economy around confined maritime routes in the form of impacts to fisheries and tourism alves et al 2014 2015 according to the reports of the guangxi government lu 2018 oil spills in the beibu gulf occur almost every year mostly due to illegal discharges and minor technical problems in ships this indicates that there is indeed a high oil spill susceptibility in the beibu gulf a scientific and accurate susceptibility assessment of such oil spills can aid a community s prevention and readiness to better manage emergency plans and minimise economic damage lan et al 2015 meanwhile some researches have considered the impact of seasonally varying population distributions in the assessment of oil spill susceptibility so as to minimise ecosystem damage helle et al 2020 however a fundamental knowledge gap still exists regarding the assessment of the oil spill susceptibility of the beibu gulf as well as local environmental impacts oil spill models have proved to be an effective means of conducting oil susceptibility assessments after the first oil spill model was developed by the us government doi in 1975 several kinds of oil susceptibility models such as oilmap and medslick zodiatis et al 2017a gnome noaa the osis system warren spring laboratory bmt ceemaid ltd norway oilpill stat system and oscar oil spill risk analysis etc have been developed to predict oil spill trajectory and fate under actual environmental conditions spaulding 2017 combined with atmospheric and hydrodynamic data sets the models could make a significant contribution to oil spill susceptibility analyses due to their effective prediction of the transport fate and weathering processes of oil slicks coupled with a clear understanding of the mobilisation of resources management decisions in pre planning emergency response could be more effective and therefore reduce the negative effects of oil spills on the marine environment el fadel et al 2012 alves et al 2015 2016 nevertheless it is challenging to ensure the accuracy of the simulated trajectories and fate of oil slicks in offshore areas such as the beibu gulf this is because regional parameters associated with local bathymetric and climatic characteristics such as wind current and tidal cycles are more sensitive and vary with time relative to seafloor depth alves et al 2015 2016 in order to improve the performance of oil spill models for the gulf of mexico price 2006 focused on correcting the current parameter of the oil spill susceptibility analysis model by analysing the drifter track lee et al 2020 concluded that tidal current and waves are important factors in forecasting oil spill diffusion zodiatis et al 2017a b based on the fact that spilled oil moves vertically on the water s surface by wave and tide they established the swan model to parameterise these same tides and waves they compile their results as factors in the oil particle model random walk rw in a three dimensional oil spill model which accurately predicted the hebei spirit oil spill lee et al 2020 thus oil spill accidents mentioned above reveal that the regional parameterisation current parameter tidal current and waves have significant effect on the improvement of accuracy of the simulated trajectories besides remote sensing data current parameters water depth and tidal cycles mentioned above wind also plays an important role in the oil spill model wind has been established as one of the most important factors for the movement of an oil slick at the top of the water column geng et al 2016 brenner has pointed out that prevailing winds leads to potential susceptibility of cross border pollution transport from oil spills in small semi enclosed basins brenner 2020 in existing oil spill susceptibility analyses uncertainty errors are the main factors affecting the accuracy of the assessment sepp neves et al 2015 according to the special basin scale of the beibu gulf wind is the main source of uncertainty error bi 2012 demonstrates the importance of wind induced factors in oil spill movements for this reason a more accurate wind parameter is necessary bi et al 2012 le hénaff 2012 concluded on the importance of wind in oil spill movement boufadel 2014 quantitatively studied the influence of wind power on oil spill movement and found that a 6 difference in wind velocity would lead to a significant difference in oil spill movement most of the current oil spill models use correctional wind experience parameters which may lead to differences in forecast results zodiatis et al 2017a b at present it is difficult to determine an accurate wind induced factor for oil spill prediction yu et al 2016b demonstrates that due to drift and changes in the marine environment the wind induced factor in the oil spill models may not be constant furthermore the wind in the beibu gulf is affected by monsoons typhoons and seasonal change as a result the regional parameterisation is important for oil spill susceptibility assessment in the beibu gulf and accurate wind induced factor is necessary to improve this assessment accuracy it is also important to note that susceptibility assessment is not only limited to the oil spill model but is also related to coastal vulnerability yu et al 2018 this paper proposes a regional oil spill susceptibility analyse method for the beibu gulf it provides a method of wind parameterisation for the oil spill model and establishes an accurate oil spill trajectory prediction model in addition a monthly susceptibility map suitable for the beibu gulf was generated to improve the prevention of oil spill in this area the oil spill situation in weizhou oilfield in the beibu gulf is simulated and monthly susceptibility maps are compared to the actual event in order to determine accuracy of the prediction results 2 data and methods 2 1 oceanographic data this study made use of wind data from the ecmwf european centre for medium range weather forecasts for interim reanalysis data it has the grid resolution of 1 8 and temporal resolution of 1 day which setting the 12 00 data per day as the average data for that day the surface currents are modelled using hycom hybrid coordinate ocean model with a spatial resolution of 1 12 and a time resolution of 6 h the vertical resolution ranges from 2 to 1000 m with a total of 40 layers the hycom data contains the sea surface height current thermohaline temperature salinity i4oilspill is a combination of the eulerian lagrangian model and eulerian cycle model with the presumption that only turbulent dispersion along the vertical direction was considered the i4oilspill simulates 3d oil transport and fates by dividing the water body into several horizontal layers and each layer is regarded as an independent horizontal plane like sea surface it has proved its regional adaptability in bohai sea china yu et al 2016a the drifter data used in this paper was obtained from the noaa s atlantic oceanographic and meteorological laboratory aoml and the data within the latitude and longitude of the beibu gulf were selected with a time resolution of 6 h 2 2 method for predicting oil spill movement in oil spill predictions the eulerian lagrangian transport model shows that the transport of oil slicks at sea surface are affected by currents and wind in parallel the transformation process demonstrates the life cycle of the oil spill by tracking the process of oil spill transport diffusion evaporation dissolution and emulsification amongst other processes yu et al 2016b in this study the regional parameterisation of wind induced drift factor of the beibu gulf is used in the i4oilspill oil model the i4oilspill simulates oil surface transport controlled by current and winds through the input of data on the spill wind sea surface temperature and three dimensional currents the i4oilspill calculated the coordinate position of the spill for several hours and then for several days see fig 2 oil spills in the marine environment are mostly driven by surface currents and the upper portion of oil spill is directly affected by the wind according to the general eulerian lagrangian equation the oil spill on the surface is dispersed into oil spill particles by turbulence which is parameterised by random walk models apart from advection and diffusion displacement the oil spill particles will also undergo physical and chemical changes known as the weathering processes evaporation emulsification sedimentation adhesion to the coast zodiatis et al 2017a b the overall process is shown in fig 3 the i4oilspill includes the correct representation of the currents and winds in the horizontal displacement of the eulerian lagrangian trajectory model and takes into account the impact of stokes drift in order to clarify the relationship between the eulerian lagrangian particle method and oil concentration models it is assumed that the composition of oil spill particles does not affect their hydrodynamics and transportation in water though the oil type has important implications to the way it moved across a water body and also affected the volumes of oil emulsified and sunk in sea water alves et al 2016 zodiatis et al 2017a b focused on the influence of wind parameterisation on the oil spill model the oil type parameters in the oil spill movement equation is simplified in this study the following equation 1 represent the weathering process and equation 2 represents the movement of the oil spill 1 c 1 t j 1 m r j c 1 2 c t k c 1 u c 1 c 1 represents the oil spill concentration in the weathering part and c is the oil spill concentration driven by advection and turbulence k is the turbulent fluctuation tensor of the turbulent diffusion u represents the depth averaged current velocity for the water column including waves wind and water which are the most important forces affecting the surface movement of oil spill r j x c 1 x t t represents the weathering process it should correspond to the actual calculation process through the input data the model calculates the process of the transformation to obtain the result of equation 1 it defines the oil slick state variable and solves equation 2 by applying lagrangian particle model the spread of oil is mainly determined by a large scale flow field the movement of any oil spill can be expressed in terms of equation 2 taking the surface oil spill as an example the transport process of oil particles can be expressed as follows 3 d x k t u c x k y k 0 t u w x k y k t u s x k y k t d t d x k t u c represents eulerian current velocity which is formed by the force of buoyancy and is generated by the prediction or analysis data of ocean numerical models u w hereinafter referred to as local wind speed term is a part of velocity correction which is necessary due to the errors in simulating the wind driving the average current called the ekman current zodiatis et al 2017a b u s hereafter known as the wave velocity term is the velocity of the water in the form of wave or the velocity caused by the stokes drift the surface currents can be parameterised into an equation for wind intensity and the angle between winds and currents as follows 4 u w α w x cos β w y sin β v w α w x sin β w y cos β where w x and w y are respectively the wind speed and its component at a height of 10 m above the surface α is called drift factor which does not include the impact of strokes drift β is called drift angle due to the difference in time and space the flow condition of ocean current differs and sometimes the wind speed and direction also vary given this when oil spills occur the movement from the oil spill centre differs in terms of place and time most models have a drift factor of about 3 and drift angle from 0 to 25 al rabeh et al 2000 by comparing the actual wind speed and wind direction of the whole year in one of the data sets the linear regression equation 5 is obtained 5 α 1 n v w i v w v d r v d r v w i v w 2 adapting to the region we choose the beibu gulf 107 e 110 e 19 n 22 n drifter data in order to extract the velocity u and v among them the v w i is wind speed component v w is the average of the wind speed v d r is a drifter s velocity components v d r is the drifter s average speed n is the number of the wind drifter data set a total of 2800 sections of the wind drifter data set were used to compute α creating a 0 25 0 25 grid based on the monthly data with a resolution of 0 1 m s in the horizontal direction at the same latitude and longitude the wind speed v w i and drifter speed v d r were screened to obtain a large number of v w i v d r value pairs for example the least square method was used for linear regression to obtain the drift factor α 3 85 suitable for the beibu gulf area in year 2008 in order to display the results intuitively finite element meshes were used in the data processing with a resolution of approximately 0 001 0 001 they were used to draw the oil spill concentration and each grid represented tons per square kilometre in terms of the initial setting of oil platforms 24 typical platforms in the beibu gulf weizhou oilfield were selected with the same accident probability take one of the oil platforms as an example first the oil spill is discretized into different numbers of oil particles starting from the set leaking time the oil spill leaks according to the preset coordinates of the oil platform based on the current coordinates of the wind and current velocity the drift factor α is calculated equation 5 the velocity of each oil spill particle is calculated as per equation 4 based on the predicted time length of the oil spill several oil spill scenarios in different states were calculated and displayed on the output graph in each scenario under the different conditions cucco et al 2012 de dominicis et al

reference value for the prevention and emergency of actual oil spill events 4 1 seasonal susceptibility map of the beibu gulf the oil spill susceptibility map of the beibu gulf can be divided into four parts according to the seasons a in spring oil spills are generally in high concentration and susceptibility is in high level the high susceptibility areas are mainly concentrated in the northern and north western parts of the beibu gulf b in summer the oil spill trajectory shifted eastward and high oil spill susceptibility areas mainly in the northeast and east parts of the beibu gulf due to the decline in oil spill concentration oil spill susceptibility was mainly determined by coastal vulnerability and the oil spill susceptibility index was low because of high temperature the shape of the oil spill changed from a block shape to a banded shape c in fall the area of oil spill decreased significantly and it mainly moved westward because the diffusion area is small the oil spill susceptibility during this season was mainly affected by the oil spill concentration d in winter the low temperature slows down the spread of oil spill and the area of oil spill decreases significantly the oil spill totally gathers in the north western part of the beibu gulf forming irregular block shapes in summary the seasonal variation of the beibu gulf leads to changes in water temperature and wind field thus changing the level of oil spill susceptibility in various regions in winter and spring the high susceptibility areas of the beibu gulf are concentrated in pearl bay which in the northwest and the peninsula of beihai city which in the north in the fall the concentration of oil spills is low and in winter it is concentrated in zhanjiang city which in the east of the beibu gulf the susceptibility of oil spills in the spring and summer seasons is significantly higher than in the autumn and winter seasons because the wind is smooth and oil spills spread faster at higher temperatures by comparing the result of oil spill susceptibilitys in different seasons we can take emergency measures accordingly for example spring and summer oil spills are banded shape which increases the length of shoreline spills and that needs for more extensive emergency measures to further analysis the susceptibility of oil spills in the beibu gulf four high susceptibility zones in the beibu gulf are provided 4 2 high susceptibility zones in the beibu gulf the four high susceptibility zones along the beibu gulf are focused on fishing nature conservation and salt production faced with high susceptibility areas the government should try to avoid setting up oil platforms in these areas if a platform has been set up in the susceptibility area additional measures such as oil pipeline reinforcement and other measures to reduce the possibility of oil spill must be undertaken as can be seen from fig 5 the low susceptibility index is distributed among the unused water bodies and port areas in the central and western part of the beibu gulf although the susceptibility index is smaller in low susceptibility areas the government should still put an emphasis on safety inspections however this research still has a degree of uncertainty for instance the calculation of susceptibility index i only considers the impact of pollution and a complex index system is adopted to evaluate the final susceptibility resulting in a more appropriate and complete solution if coordinated with local authorities ecological and socio economic sensitivities can be considered so that more accurate indicators can be created for example coastal areas should be accurately assessed with regard to market economy it is worth noting that the response and resilience of local governments to oil spills also has an important impact on the susceptibility index 4 3 policy implications for the high susceptibility area it s necessary for the government to implement appropriate policies for oil spilling these strategies require decision makers to make a balance between ecological issues and economic development such as keeping new oil platforms away from zone 3 4 in summer and 1 in winter in order to take cleaning measures after the accident preparing common apparatuses such as booms skimmers dredges and pumping vessels is important and it could be necessary to take severe measures in order to address the problem before the accident s at national and international levels it will effectively reduce the impact of oil spill accidents 4 4 validation of the oil spill forecast this paper demonstrates the effectiveness of oil spill results in two ways through the use of drifter data and data from the actual oil spill accident 4 4 1 validation of oil spill trajectory by drifter data based on the global drifter data and the coordinate range of the beibu gulf 107 e 110 e 19 n 22 n 4147 drifter data in this area were selected according to the statistics from national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa drifter data are mainly distributed in 2005 and 2006 by the atlantic oceanographic and meteorological laboratory aoml affiliated with noaa due to the time distribution being relatively sparse the may 2006 drifter data was selected as it was more complete it had a total of 3108 drifter points the drifter starting position was selected as the initial point of the oil spill and the drifter itself was used as a tracer of oil spill validation results show that the drifter correlated with the oil spill trajectories the results are shown in fig 6 4 4 2 validation of oil spill trajectory by actual oil spill accident taking the weizhou oilfield oil spill accident in august 2008 as an example the validity and feasibility of the algorithm were verified three crude oil spills occurred in the weizhou oilfield of china s national offshore oil corporation on august 16 23 and 27 2008 on the morning of september 3 a satellite remote sense monitoring the weizhou island sea area found a large area covered by the oil spill on the morning of september 4 the cnooc aircraft in weizhou island 12 nautical miles southwest of the sea also found about 10 km2 of oil pollution in september the spill affected the entire coastal region of guangxi and large amounts of black crude oil were found on beaches in the beihai city the i4oilspill was used to simulate the oil spill track of 24 oil platforms in weizhou oilfield of the beibu gulf in 2008 and the possible high susceptibility oil spill area was identified it was found that the high susceptibility oil spill area in august was located in beihai city which corresponds with the practical situation see fig 7 5 conclusions in recent years the south china sea has become a hot spot of economic development the number of offshore oil drilling platforms near the beibu gulf make it a high susceptibility area therefore it is necessary to evaluate the susceptibility of oil spills in the beibu gulf in this study the unique regional parameterisation of wind induced drift factor was determined this factor considers the influence of regional wind in the beibu gulf compared with the experienced parameters in the traditional oil spill mode drifter data is used to reduce the random influence of environment parameters in oil spill simulation in addition the oil spill susceptibility analyse method which uses this factor obtained precisely prediction result in the beibu gulf the factor is verified by using the data of oil spill accident in weizhou oilfield and the trajectory of drifter during the same period furthermore taking note of the oil spill movement and the vulnerability of coastal land a susceptibility map of the oil spill combined with regional characteristics of the beibu gulf was drawn meanwhile the regional susceptibility of the beibu gulf in different seasons was evaluated by assessing the regional distribution of risks in the beibu gulf in different seasons authorities can enact seasonal policies and increase the probability of avoiding the susceptibility of oil spills as for environmental protection the beibu gulf has a large number of fishery tourism resources economic development in the area primarily relies on the stability of the natural environment since the china asean free trade area was established the beibu gulf has become the focus of world attention meanwhile there is an increase in the exploitation of natural resources in this region the susceptibility map can ensure the stable development of regional economy it can be used to better implement the environmental protection policy in the beibu gulf so as to improve the stability of regional economic credit authorship contribution statement fangjie yu conceptualization methodology project

21557,ocean currents are a potentially reliable source of renewable energy but the complications associated with deploying current energy conversion cec devices in deep water make harvesting that energy a challenge one promising approach is to use tethered axial flow cecs composed of one or more pairs of coaxial counter rotating turbines however a dual rotor system moored in unsteady water by a flexible tether is likely to experience a condition called skew where the axis of rotation is not aligned with the direction of flow a lab scale turbine was constructed to investigate the effect of skew on fluid power conversion of a coaxial cec a semi empirical model of the power conversion was developed for comparing the results to a recently published analytical model it was found that the analytical model represents the data better than a simple ad hoc modification to previous models that is often used to estimate the power dynamics additionally the results support the existence of a physical phenomenon captured by the recent model but not represented in the ad hoc modification in which the downstream rotor of a coaxial pair is partially within the wake and partially out of the

untapped potential source of renewable energy the gulf stream current flows along the eastern united states and is nearest the mainland off the coasts of florida and north carolina haas 2013 the power density of the gulf stream near cape hatteras nc is estimated to be 500 1000 w m2 bane et al 2017 and it has been suggested that as much as one gigawatt of hydrokinetic power may be extracted from the gulf stream without significant disruption of climatic conditions yang 2013 conventional fluid kinetic energy conversion systems such as bladed turbines may be applied for capturing the power in ocean currents current energy converters cecs for wind are a mature technology wind turbines are typically mounted on towers however with the gulf stream current sometimes flowing over deep sea waters that may be 3000 meters or deeper haas 2013 bane et al 2017 a vertical cantilever tower is not a feasible means for fixing a cec to the sea bed in the ocean currents along the continental shelf a moored i e tethered approach may be a feasible alternative to the rigid tower for anchoring ocean cecs underwater moorings are easier to install and maintain than rigid structures but tethers are unable to provide the stabilizing reaction loads of towers and an unstable tethered system may be prone to entanglement however clever design and integration of one or more pairs of counter rotating rotors in a single vehicle system can result in zero net torque and or angular momentum usui et al 2013 thus mitigating the entanglement issue and eliminating the need for a tower furthermore tethered coaxial turbines tend to self align with the direction of flow clarke et al 2010 nonetheless without the rigid structure tethered systems are more susceptible to attitude perturbations in the still fluctuating ocean currents in general turbines are designed to operate in a specific orientation e g with the plane of rotation perpendicular to the flow for horizontal axis axial flow turbines any perturbation to the attitude of a turbine results in a condition called skew where the axis of rotation is not properly aligned with respect to the flow the effect of skew on the overall power conversion performance of wind farms has been investigated for tandem turbine configurations where the alignment of each rotor with the direction of flow is independent and it has been demonstrated that an increase in power conversion of as much as 12 percent may be realized with an upstream turbine operating in skew and a downstream turbine aligned with the freestream direction adaramola and krogstad 2011 however performance of the coupled system depends also on the properties of the operational environment and operation of the non coaxial upstream turbine in skew may or may not result in greater power conversion ozbay 2014 the flow alignment of the rotors comprising a multi rotor system is mechanically coupled and the dual rotor approach has received a considerable amount of attention partially because the net angular momentum and torque of the system may be reduced and potentially eliminated by having each rotor turn in opposite directions clarke et al 2007 dual rotor fluid energy conversion systems may be classified broadly as either coaxial or not coaxial coaxial turbines are characterized by a common axis of rotation for all rotors in the system non coaxial turbines have rotors with axes of rotation that are not collinear whether or not they are coaxial dual rotor machines may be designed such that the nominal direction of flow is along the axis i e axial flow or perpendicular to the flow i e transverse flow the axial and transverse flow machines are commonly known as horizontal axis and vertical axis respectively because of their usual orientation with respect to the horizon both coaxial didane et al 2018 and non coaxial li and calıcsal 2010 li and calisal 2011 vertical axis dual rotor systems have been studied and both show potential for improvement in performance over single rotor turbines for example both the overall power and torque of the dual rotor coaxial machine were increased by more than threefold over a similar single rotor system didane et al 2018 similarly constructive hydrodynamic interactions could result in a doubling of the efficiency of a non coaxial dual rotor vertical axis turbine over a similar single rotor machine li and calıcsal 2010 however with their axis of rotation perpendicular to the direction of flow vertical axis turbines may require considerable additional structure for use in tethered applications and thus may be more appropriate for shallower tidal waters than open ocean currents horizontal axis machines have rotors that are designed such that the axis of rotation is nominally aligned with the direction of flow horizontal axis cecs with non coaxial rotors are sometimes referred to as side by side or parallel plane machines parallel plane dual rotor turbines have been deployed on structures fixed to the seabed for tidal energy conversion fraenkel 2010 and have been proposed as tethered devices for ocean current energy conversion chen et al 2015 coiro et al 2017 2018 vanzwieten et al 2006 wu et al 2019 however in their intended operation there is no hydrodynamic interaction between rotors in the parallel plane turbines thus notwithstanding farm applications they lose any advantage that constructive interaction may present additionally unlike the coaxial devices where torque transmission is in torsion through a shaft torque between two parallel plane rotors is transmitted in bending requiring additional structure fleming 2015 by contrast coaxial dual rotor turbines have the potential for improved aero hydrodynamic performance one concept is to extract the flow power that remains in the wake after the fluid has passed through the rotor plane in his seminal work newman demonstrated that the theoretical limit of power extraction for two rotor disks of equal diameter is about 8 greater than the limit for a single rotor disk newman 1983 and later extended that work to show that the increase is limited to 13 for an infinite number of disks newman 1986 an investigation of this concept for wind energy conversion found that when they are aligned with the direction of flow coaxial counter rotating turbines convert more power than both single rotor and co rotating dual rotor systems because the leeward rotor is able to harness some of the kinetic energy associated with the swirling wake of the windward rotor ozbay et al 2015 another idea investigated for wind turbines is to use auxiliary rotors to extract energy from otherwise underexploited flow in a single rotor horizontal axis turbine the portion of blade nearest the axis of rotation i e the blade root is called the blade dead zone because the relative flow speed is lower than it is in regions closer to the tip and because structural considerations typically require a less efficient section shape at the root improved exploitation of the freestream fluid power may be possible through use of a smaller auxiliary rotor which has the working portions of its blades in the dead zone of the main rotor it has been estimated that a 9 increase could be realized using this approach jung et al 2005 others have extended the concept of an auxiliary rotor to address both the dead zone losses and wake retrieval rosenberg et al 2014 and have shown that the unsteady loads on the primary rotor do not increase significantly with use of an auxiliary rotor upstream moghadassian et al 2016 coaxial cecs for both wind e g jung et al 2005 kanemoto and galal 2006 habash et al 2011 rosenberg et al 2014 wang et al 2016 moghadassian et al 2016 thelen et al 2018 and hydrokinetic energy conversion e g clarke et al 2007 charles 2009 huang and kanemoto 2015 borthwick 2016 funami et al 2017 have been studied although dual rotor coaxial turbines can convert more power than a single rotor habash et al 2011 the modest efficiency gains achieved by coaxial turbines may be more relevant for wind energy conversion than for ocean currents in ocean applications deployment and maintenance costs tend to dominate the economic analysis neary et al 2014 and the benefits of a single point mooring may be more impactful than the increases in power production for a coaxial dual rotor cec with a fixed attitude system properties such as the blade pitch and the separation distance between rotors impact the power conversion performance wei et al 2015 however as previously noted tethered cecs are more susceptible to alignment disturbances than fixed systems and variation in attitude i e skew is known to affect the performance of horizontal axis turbines to better understand how attitude perturbations affect the power conversion performance of a coaxial turbine khatri et al extended the multiple actuator disk theory newman 1986 to a system of two coaxial actuator disks operating in skew khatri et al 2019 we call the extension the extended dual actuator disk edad model from analysis of the extended theory the authors found that under optimal conditions the total power converted by a dual rotor coaxial system operating in skew is greater than the power converted by the same system when the axis of rotation is aligned with the direction of flow see fig 8 in khatri et al 2019 this finding is in contrast to the monotonic decrease in extracted power with skew by a single turbine system wang et al 2019 schulz et al 2017 tongchitpakdee et al 2005 although the effects of a single non coaxial turbine in skew in a tandem rotor system have been studied and the power dynamics of counter rotating rotors have been examined when they are aligned with the direction of flow coaxial turbines in skew have not been thoroughly investigated the objective of this work was to experimentally measure the power dynamics of a dual rotor coaxial turbine operating in skew and to compare the results to the edad model developed by khatri et al this paper describes the approach to the investigation beginning with a brief discussion of the theoretical background and the edad model followed by a presentation of the results with discussion 2 theoretical background and the edad model when a rotor operates in a moving fluid the velocity of the fluid is affected by the presence of the rotor in the axial single actuator disk theory a single parameter typically referred to as the induction factor quantifies the relationship between the magnitude of the fluid velocity at the three boundaries of two regions of the flow the two flow regions are upstream and downstream of the disk and the boundaries are far upstream in the rotor plane and far downstream the single actuator disk theory employs conservation of momentum and mass continuity to describe the fluid velocity at the rotor plane and far downstream from the rotor as a function of the induction factor and the known freestream velocity betz 2013 the induction factor is a measure of the change in the speed of the fluid that is induced by the rotor thus it is a measure of the transfer of kinetic energy between the flow and the rotor when a rotor is operating to add energy to the fluid as in propulsion the induced change is an increase in velocity of the fluid conversely when a rotor is operating to extract energy from the fluid as with a turbine the induced change is a retardation of the flow newman extended the single actuator disk theory first to two actuators newman 1983 and then to an infinite number of disks representing a series of coaxial rotors newman 1986 like the single actuator disk model newman s model relates the velocity at the boundaries of regions of the flow using induction factors where the number of induction factors necessary to describe the relationship between velocities is equal to the number of rotors for example in a two rotor model two induction factors define the flow speed at the boundaries between three regions of flow as a fraction of the freestream speed the three regions shown in the left panel of fig 1 are a upstream b between and c downstream and the four boundaries are far upstream in the plane of the windward rotor in the plane of the leeward rotor and downstream the first induction factor describes the relationship between the flow speed far upstream of the windward rotor left side of region a in the plane of the windward rotor between regions a and b and downstream of the windward rotor but upstream of the leeward rotor region b the second induction factor describes the relationship between the flow speed between the rotors region b in the plane of the leeward rotor between regions b and c and far downstream of the leeward rotor right side of region c these two induction factors may be described as the windward and leeward induction factors respectively both the single actuator disk model described by betz 2013 and the multi disk model developed by newman 1986 assume that the actuator disks are perpendicular with the direction of flow i e that the axis of rotation of a rotor represented by the actuator disk is aligned with the flow the edad model extends the dual actuator disk model to account for operation in skew when the axis of rotation is at angle with respect to the direction of flow khatri et al 2019 as demonstrated conceptually by the right panel in fig 1 when a dual coaxial rotor system operates in skew the leeward rotor may emerge from the wake of the windward rotor and create two additional flow regions a region upstream of the exposed portion of the leeward rotor and an region downstream of the exposed portion region d and region e in the right panel of fig 1 respectively the third induction factor which may be described as the fresh flow induction factor describes the relationship between the fluid velocity at the outside boundaries of these additional regions and in the plane of the exposed portion of the leeward rotor the physical result of the leeward rotor emerging from the wake is that for the portion of the rotor experiencing fresh flow there is a larger amount of kinetic energy available in the fluid than for the portion of the rotor that is within the wake if the leeward rotor is able to harvest the additional energy the total power generated by the dual rotor system may be greater than it would be if the leeward rotor were to remain in the wake of the windward rotor the power p r e f available in a fluid of density ρ flowing with freestream velocity v through an area of interest a is expressed as eq 1 the rate of flow of kinetic energy through the area white 1999 1 p r e f 1 2 ρ a v 3 from the rankine froude axial momentum theory the power available to an actuator disk of area a is given by eq 2 where e is the axial induction factor defined as the ratio of the axial fluid speed at the disk to the axial freestream speed spera 2009 2 p 2 ρ a e 1 e 2 v 3 in the classical actuator disk theory eq 1 is typically used as a reference for eq 2 to compute the formula for the nondimensional power coefficient c p 4 e 1 e 2 for a single rotor operating in skew at angle θ with respect to the direction of flow assuming that the rotor can only extract energy in the axial direction then only the axial component of the velocity at the rotor plane is contributing to the available power in this case v in eq 2 is replaced by v a x i a l v c o s θ and normalization by the reference power of eq 1 provides an estimate for how the power of a single rotor may change with skew given by eq 3 3 c p p a x i a l p r e f 4 e 1 e 2 c o s 3 θ eq 3 suggests that a simple modification of the single actuator disk model by the cube of the cosine of the skew angle is sufficient to describe the power dynamics at small angles i e less than 30 degrees observed power may deviate significantly from the cosine cubed modification of the axial momentum theory particularly during dynamic skew wang et al 2019 and more sophisticated treatments such as the glauert lift correction or the vortex cylinder model may be more accurate burton 2011 however empirical power data for a single rotor are well described over a large range of skew angles by the cosine cubed modification e g fig 5 20 in spera 2009 if the power extracted by a single rotor in skew can be estimated by modification of the single actuator disk model by the cube of the cosine of the skew angle then it is reasonable to assume that the same is true for the dual disk model however such a modification of newman s dual rotor model neglects the fresh flow effect described above by contrast the edad model captures the fresh flow effect resulting in an increase in predicted power conversion as demonstrated graphically in fig 2 according to the edad model a turbine with equal diameter rotors separated by a distance of one half of the diameter has a theoretical maximum power coefficient of 0 677 at 11 degrees skew an increase of 5 72 over the theoretical maximum of 0 64 at zero skew to generate fig 2 the windward and leeward induction factors in both the modified newman and edad models are set at the optimal zero skew values of 1 5 and 3 5 respectively khatri et al 2019 three different values for the fresh flow induction factor in the edad model are used to generate the three curves in the figure the most power is predicted when the fresh flow induction factor is at the optimal value 1 3 dotted line khatri et al 2019 slightly less power is predicted when the fresh flow induction factor is at the maximum value allowed by momentum theory 1 2 dashed line but there is still an increase with skew power coefficient of 0 66 at 9 degrees vs 0 64 at zero skew if the fresh flow portion of the leeward rotor is not inducing any change to the fluid velocity i e induction is 0 dot dashed line then it is not extracting energy and only the portion in the wake of the windward rotor is contributing to the total power produced in the newman model the power coefficient is maximized by a windward induction factor of 0 2 and a leeward induction factor of 0 6 resulting is a power coefficient value of 0 64 newman 1983 the solid line in fig 2 shows how the power coefficient of the newman model diminishes monotonically when modified by the cube of the cosine of the skew angle likewise there is a monotonic decrease in power with skew predicted by the edad model when the windward and leeward induction factors are 0 2 and 0 6 respectively and the value of the fresh flow induction factor is small i e when the fresh flow portion of the leeward rotor is not extracting much energy from the fluid not surprisingly the total power predicted by the edad model is also less than that predicted by the modified newman model when the fresh flow induction factor is zero because only the portion of the leeward rotor that is in the wake of the windward rotor is contributing to the total power production by contrast when the fresh flow induction factor is at the optimal value 1 3 the dotted line in fig 2 the power increases with skew to a maximum value at around 12 degrees and then decreases with any additional skew the nonmonotonic curve suggests that for a given dual rotor coaxial turbine under certain conditions there is an optimum non zero skew angle where the power produced is greater than it would be if the system were aligned with the flow the induction of a spinning rotor is a function of both the geometry e g the shape size and number of blades and the rate at which it spins consequently the situations depicted in fig 2 are all physically difficult to realize as the dual rotor system experiences skew in a constant current the axial component of the flow velocity diminishes the rotor spins slower and the induction factor changes similarly as the leeward rotor emerges from the wake of the windward rotor during skew the exposed portion is in a different region of flow fig 1 as the rotor spins sections of different blades will enter and exit the fresh flow fig 1 right d and e and wake fig 1 right b and c regions of the flow in order to maintain a constant induction factor for the entire rotor each blade would need to dynamically morph into a new geometry as it passes into a new flow region during a cycle of rotation which is obviously problematic however fig 2 is nonetheless instructive because it demonstrates the theoretical maximum and shows that the edad model can capture the hypothesized fresh flow phenomenon whereas existing actuator disk models do not the fresh flow induction factor is independent of the area of the exposed portion of the leeward turbine however the power produced by the dual rotor coaxial turbine in skew does depend on how much of the leeward rotor is exposed thus khatri et al developed a formulation for the wake area fraction given by eq 5 that depends on the geometry of the system e g the rotor diameter and the distance between the rotors the skew angle and the values of the windward and leeward induction factors in developing the formulation for wake area fraction khatri et al assumed a cylindrical stream tube i e no wake expansion therefore the edad model overestimates the wake deflection of the windward rotor and thus underpredicts the wake area fraction at a given skew angle or equivalently overpredicts the proportion of leeward rotor exposed to fresh flow as a result the edad model provides a boundary of expected power production for a real dual rotor turbine operating in skew the change in axial component of flow speed due to skew is the same for all sections of the coaxial rotors however the portion of leeward rotor remaining in the wake of the windward rotor is reduced with skew therefore at any fixed value for the leeward induction factor the portion of the rotor will have less area and will thus convert less power the power converted by the overall system however depends also on the power converted by the portion of the leeward rotor exposed to fresh flow if the fresh flow induction factor is zero then the overall system will convert less power than if the entire leeward rotor were within the wake as demonstrated by the dot dash line in fig 2 if the value of the fresh flow induction factor is 1 3 rd i e that portion of the leeward rotor is optimally extracting power then the system will be converting more power than it would have been if the leeward rotor were entirely in the wake this is true even if the portion of the leeward rotor in the wake is optimally extracting power because the kinetic energy is higher in the freestream flow than it is in the wake of the windward rotor in practice the fresh flow induction factor is unlikely to be zero although it is possible e g a slowly rotating single bladed turbine furthermore it is reasonable to assume that at any rotation speed the fresh flow induction factor would be similar in value to the windward induction factor if the two rotors are of similar geometry because the exposed portion of the leeward rotor is experiencing similar flow therefore it is reasonable to suggest that the observed power coefficient of a real rotor would be somewhere between that predicted by the newman model and the value predicted by the edad model when the value of the fresh flow induction factor is 1 3 rd the power coefficient for a dual rotor system similar to eq 3 for a single rotor is defined as the ratio of the power produced by both rotors to the reference power given by eq 1 the equation for the power coefficient of the edad model is given by eq 4 where α is the wake area fraction e w is the windward induction factor e l is the leeward induction factor e f is the fresh flow induction factor and θ is the skew angle khatri et al 2019 when α is equal to one i e the leeward rotor is completely in the wake of the windward rotor 4 reduces to the modified newman model and when θ is also zero i e no skew 4 is exactly the dual turbine model described by newman newman 1983 4 c p p p r e f 4 cos 3 θ 2 α 1 e w 2 e w α 1 e l 2 e l 2 e w 1 α 1 e f 2 e f the edad curves in fig 2 are constructed using eq 4 the meticulous observer may notice a slight kink in the curve representing the power when the fresh flow induction factor is at the optimal value edad 1 3 dotted line located just past 50 degrees of skew that is the point at which the leeward rotor fully emerges from the wake of the windward rotor thus the wake area fraction reaches a minimum value of zero and the power diminishes as the cosine cubed of the skew angle as if both disks were independent the wake area fraction described by 5 is defined as the fraction of the leeward rotor that is within the wake of the windward rotor in 5 d is the distance between the rotors d is the diameter of the rotors and all other symbols are as described previously 5 α 1 2 tan θ 2 e w e l d d a full treatment of the derivation of 4 and 5 may be found in khatri et al 2019 3 materials and methods a prototype dual rotor coaxial cec system was designed and built to measure the mechanical rotary power converted from the fluid flow power the prototype system was mounted in a controlled flow environment and observations were made under various conditions the data collected were reduced and applied towards analysis of the actuator disk models through construction of a semi empirical composite model 3 1 dual rotor prototype to maximize the reconfigurability of the prototype the reusability of components and the overall usefulness of the experimental platform the principle of hierarchical modularity was applied to develop the dual rotor cec system lipson 2007 the modules at the top layer include the body and rotors secondary modules within the body module include components for actuation and sensing and the rotors modules contain blade units at the secondary level further down the hierarchical levels are modules that are not physically separable from the blade units but are nonetheless independent from a design perspective these modules include the blades and the airfoils 3 1 1 rotor conceptually a rotor is made up of one or more blades though in practice a single bladed rotor is problematic the two major design parameters of the rotor are the number of blades and the radius a three bladed rotor was chosen for its axial symmetry and resistance to cogging in skew operation khatri et al 2018 the rotor radius was designed to maximize power conversion while falling within the constraints imposed by the open channel water tunnel at north carolina state university the water tunnel test section has a nominal cross section of 81 by 61 cm 32 by 24 inches stewart 2017 under optimal conditions the wake behind the rotor expands by a factor of about three spera 2009 therefore a rotor diameter of 20 3 cm 8 inches was selected to minimize the possibility of wake wall interactions propagating upstream and corrupting the measurements 3 1 2 blade units the blade units are composed of the blades and an incorporated hub portion that facilitates rotor assembly see bottom fig 3 the blades are designed as a series of constant chord airfoils with a specified orientation to define the spanwise twist distribution the sg6040 airfoil was selected for its favorable performance at lower reynolds numbers lyon et al 1997 the twist distribution was designed by first calculating a target tip speed ratio λ o according to the approach described in ragheb and m 2011 using a value of 2 for the ratio of rotor radius to upstream flow perturbation length 6 note that the target tip speed ratio in this context is a parameter in the blade twist function and not necessarily the tip speed ratio at which rotor power will be at a maximum 6 λ o ω o r v 2 π n r s the spanwise twist distribution is computed from the target tip speed ratio the twist angle is given as a function of the spanwise coordinate by eq 7 ragheb and m 2011 the target angle of attack α o is chosen to maximize the lift to drag ratio for the airfoil lyon et al 1997 7 σ arctan 2 r 3 λ o r α o eq 7 was used to design two twist distributions one with λ o 4 3 π the theoretical optimum for a three bladed rotor and another using λ o 2 the latter was chosen because it results in a higher twist angle as demonstrated by fig 3 thus reducing the cut in speed of the rotor likely at the expense of efficiency although efficiency was not a concern for this work the two twist distributions were used in two different dual rotor system configurations one where the mean twist angle of the windward rotor is high and another where it is low the mean twist angle of the leeward rotor is high in both configurations 3 1 3 body an analysis of the edad model indicates that when the distance between the two rotors is approximately half of their diameter there may be an enhanced performance zone where the net power converted in skew operation is increased and insensitive to small variations in orientation khatri et al 2019 the minimum length of the prototype is restricted by the dimensions of the internal components and the rotor diameter is constrained by the water tunnel test section to about 20 cm 8 inches the achieved rotor to rotor distance of the prototype was 10 2 cm 4 02 inches or about half of the rotor diameter the central housing components include a cylindrical shell and end caps the shell is made of a clear polycarbonate cylinder that allows for observation of moisture sensing indicator strips inside of the body during underwater operation the inner end caps are machined from martensitic stainless steel and the outer end caps are 3d printed with verowhite plus rgd 835 chosen for its low moisture absorption coefficient compared to other compatible polymers using an objet30 printer stratasys ltd edina mn the major components of the apparatus are labeled in fig 4 the rotary shaft power is transmitted through the hermetically sealed end caps using a custom built magnetic torque coupling system fig 4 which enables complete enclosure of the electronics data and power are transferred to and from the sealed enclosure by wires which pass through the sealed end caps a section view of a cad rendering of the prototype is shown in fig 4 3 1 4 instrumentation the instrumentation hardware within one half of the body tube is composed of a hb 20m magnetic hysteresis brake magtrol inc west seneca ny usa a qta141 torque sensor futek inc irvine ca usa and a kma210 magnetoresistive angular position sensor nxp semiconductors eindhoven nl this arrangement ensures that both the windward and leeward rotors have a separate dedicated set of instruments which are used to actuate or record data independently the instrument wiring passes through the body endcaps and is routed through the hollow sting and connected to an externally located data acquisition system described in 3 2 the purpose of the brake is to simulate the mechanical load of an electrical generator the hysteresis brake was chosen for the ability to control the torque remotely and because it has near zero torque when there is no applied electrical current the torque was modulated by manually adjusting the applied current using a laboratory power supply the orientation of the rotor was measured using the angular position sensor and the angles were used to compute the mean angular rate between samples 3 2 data collection the experimental prototype was secured to a rigid sting and mounted on an electronically controlled rotary stage above the test section of the north carolina state university free surface water tunnel stewart 2017 a cad rendering of the water tunnel is shown in fig 5 and fig 6 shows the prototype turbine mounted on the sting attached to the rotary stage in the water tunnel the nominal depth of the test section is 610 mm 24 inches and the width is 810 mm 32 inches a 7 5 kw 10 hp baldor reliance super e em3774t motor controlled by an acs355 variable frequency drive abb powers flow through a 4 5 1 contraction providing a velocity range from 0 15 1 0 m s with an average streamwise turbulence varying linearly from 0 2 to 0 9 along the 2 4 m 96 inches length of the glass panels stewart 2017 data were captured using a standalone data acquisition system with a pxi 8102 embedded controller in tandem with a 24 bit pxi 4462 module for multichannel recording and managed through a custom virtual instrument vi running on labview software national instruments austin tx usa all data were sampled at 1000 hz hardware synchronized and recorded to file using the custom vi the experimental procedure began with calibration of the zero skew angle and recording of the no load signal from the torque sensors for systematic error detection then the fluid velocity in the tunnel was brought to 0 5 m s next the current setting on the brake power supplies was modulated until the target signal was obtained from the torque sensors on the upstream and downstream rotors finally the rotary stage motor was used to set the prototype to a desired angle of skew upon achieving each skew angle following a brief period of time to allow damping of transient phenomena the sensor signals were sampled for 10 s and then the skew angle was increased to the next increment the procedure was repeated at incremental skew angles in both directions until a rotor stalled typically the leeward rotor for both of the two twist distributions of the upstream rotor table 1 shows the experimental input parameter values for the high high twist turbine and table 2 shows the values for the low high twist turbine 3 3 data reduction the ten seconds of torque and angular position data for the windward and leeward rotors per collection period were reduced to a mean torque and angular rate for each rotor to reduce the torque data the signals were first post processed through the matlab mathworks natick ma minimum order low pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 20 hz to remove noise after filtering the first and last one thousand samples two seconds of data were rejected and the remaining eight thousand samples eight seconds of data were reduced to the quadratic mean and the standard deviation the angular position data were converted to an angular rate using the matlab discrete fast fourier transform fft algorithm 3 3 1 uncertainty estimation prior to and following each sweep of skew angles in either direction and with the water tunnel still the systematic error in the torque measurement was obtained by removing current from the electric brakes and sampling the torque sensor signals for 10 s the total systematic error for each sweep of skew angles given in table 1 and table 2 for the low high and high high rotor twist turbine configurations respectively is estimated as the root mean square of the two collections of no torque samples bracketing the sweep the imprecision error in the torque measurement is estimated as the standard deviation over the sample period the speed imprecision error is similarly estimated as the standard deviation in the numerical derivative of the angular position over the sample period finally the combined measurement uncertainty in the power coefficient shown as error bars in figs 10 11 and 12 is estimated from the combined coefficient of variation 3 4 supplementary model both the modified newman and edad models estimate power from the values of induction factors and the skew angle neither model includes properties of physical rotors such as blade number twist distribution or rotation speed therefore these physical properties cannot be used as model inputs for comparison to observation making a direct connection between the models and empirical data challenging to convert the physical properties of the rotors to values of induction that can be used as model inputs we developed a supplementary empirical model of induction as a function of the rotation speed or tip speed ratio the mechanical shaft power developed by the spinning rotor given by eq 8 is the product of the torque τ and the angular rate ω 8 p s τ ω τ λ v r considering the relationship between torque and total hydrodynamic force at a given spanwise location along the blade a comparison of the equations for the mechanical shaft power 8 and the change in fluid power across the actuator disk for a single turbine system 2 suggests that induction may be linear in λ when the angle between the axis of rotation and the total hydrodynamic force is small for a dual turbine system a similar comparison suggests that the windward induction may be linear in the windward tip speed ratio λ w and the leeward induction may be linear in both the leeward tip speed ratio λ l and the windward induction factor thus we postulate a linear model for induction shown in eq 9 where the values of coefficients a 1 a 2 b 1 b 2 and b 3 are determined empirically 9 e w a 1 λ w a 2 e l b 1 λ l b 2 e w b 3 the relationship between the power coefficient and the rotor speed is complicated and non linear however the concavity of the curve is well established and the shape remains concave when a single rotor operates in skew bahaj et al 2007 therefore the appropriateness of the linear model of induction as a function of λ is verified by constructing the power coefficient curve from the linear induction model in composition with the single actuator disk model as given by eq 10 10 c p 4 e 1 e 2 4 a 1 λ a 2 1 a 1 λ a 2 2 the result of eq 10 when a 1 0 1 and a 2 1 is shown as fig 7 as expected the curve is concave and it is of a similar shape to the qualitative curves used in textbooks for demonstration spera 2009 as well as the empirical curves used in modeling and simulation slootweg et al 2003 agarwal et al 2010 de kooning et al 2013 finally the postulated relationship between λ and the induction factors may be exploited to compare experimental data to the analytical models through construction of a semi empirical composite model where the coefficients of eq 9 are determined by induction factors that are calculated from the measured mechanical power when the dual rotor system is in skew the total power converted depends on the wake area fraction which is a function of both induction factors as well as the induction by the exposed portion of the leeward rotor thus there is no unique solution for the induction factors when the system is in skew however when the dual rotor system is aligned with the flow the wake area fraction is unity and eq 4 may be separated into two equations for windward and leeward power equation 11 11 c p w 4 e w 1 e w 2 c p l 4 1 e l 2 e l 2 e w the induction factors at zero skew for a measured shaft power are computed by first solving for the three roots of the windward power function and then neglecting those that are infeasible according to momentum disk theory i e 0 e w 0 5 then the realizable windward induction factors are substituted into the leeward power function and the leeward induction factors are determined from the allowable roots 2 e w e l 0 5 e w next the computed induction factors are compared to the measured tip speed ratios using 9 and the values of the coefficients a 1 a 2 b 1 b 2 and b 3 are determined by a least squares fit lastly eq 9 with the empirically determined coefficient values is combined with either the edad model or the modified newman model to construct a semi empirical composite model of power coefficient as a function tip speed ratio for the newman model the coefficient values are all that is required to construct the power coefficient curves producing curves using the edad model requires an additional value for the fresh flow induction factor which must be assumed 4 results and discussion the results of the supplementary linear induction model are discussed first followed by the results of the composite models 4 1 linear induction model the values for the coefficients a 1 a 2 b 1 b 2 and b 3 in 9 were calculated as described above the windward induction factors computed from the power observations are shown in fig 8 along with the resultant models for the two twist configurations as described in section 3 1 2 the lower twist configuration is the more efficient and is therefore able to extract a higher proportion of energy from the flow after cut in the lower twist rotor is also expected to rotate faster than the higher twist configuration in a flow of constant velocity accordingly the windward induction factor curve for the lower twist rotor is above and to the right of the windward induction curve for the higher twist rotor additionally the higher twist induction curve appears less linear than the lower twist curve the exact source of the nonlinearity is unknown but it may be due to a breakdown of the assumptions of the momentum disk theory for the higher twist rotor for example at lower rotation speed a rotor is less like an actuator disk than at high rotation speed furthermore wake rotation is neglected by the axial momentum theory but the higher twist rotor may be imparting a high level of vorticity to the wake relative to the induced velocity particularly at low rotation speeds in any case the linear model appears to be a decent representation of the windward induction factor for both configurations throughout the observed range of tip speed ratio the observations and resultant models for the leeward induction factors are shown in fig 9 with the higher twist configuration shown at the left and the lower twist configuration at the right the planar surfaces show the linear models as described by eq 9 with the empirically determined coefficient values again the linear model describes the data well for both configurations having determined the coefficient values for the supplementary induction models the measured mechanical power coefficients may now be plotted along with the power coefficient curve predicted by the composite actuator disk models for the two twist configurations as shown in fig 10 note that the newman and edad models are identical when skew is zero for brevity the dual rotor configuration with the lower twist windward and higher twist leeward rotors is referred to as the low high lh configuration and the version with both higher twist windward and leeward rotors is called the high high hh configuration fig 10 demonstrates that at zero skew the data are well described by the composite model the analytical power coefficient models include induction factors e w and e l as independent variables but not tsr the tip speed ratio is incorporated into the analytical models using the empirically determined linear relationship between induction factors and tsrs because it is the zero skew data that are applied to construct the supplementary induction models this figure also shows the range of relative tsr defined as the sum of the windward and leeward tsr for which this particular composite model is valid which is from about 7 5 to 9 7 for the lh twist configuration and between about 6 5 and 9 2 for the hh configuration 4 2 coaxial turbines in skew after determining the coefficient values for the linear induction model from the zero skew measurements the empirical model is combined with the actuator disk models to create a composite model which may be compared to the experimental observations over the full range of skew angles since the fresh flow induction factor e f in the edad model cannot be back calculated from the observations two assumed values for e f are considered first the case of e f e w and second the case of e f 1 3 the first case e f e w is chosen because the edad model assumes that the exposed portion of the downstream rotor is experiencing the same freestream flow as the upstream rotor and that they both modify the flow as a function of λ in the same way if both of the rotors are identical then it is reasonable to assume that the induction factor as a function of rotor speed is identical for both of course this assumes that not only is the fresh flow portion of the leeward rotor completely out of the wake but also that the wake has no effect on the surrounding fluid which is unlikely additionally the rotors are identical only in one of the two configurations tested therefore another case is included for comparison in the edad model the portion of the leeward rotor that has emerged from the wake of the windward rotor is treated the same as an isolated actuator disk which will convert the maximum amount of power when the induction factor is 1 3 therefore assuming e f 1 3 corresponds to the optimal case and yields the maximum power coefficient from the edad model and an upper bound on the composite model the lower bound of the composite model occurs when the fresh flow induction factor is zero i e when the exposed portion of the leeward rotor is not converting any power the lower bound is not included in the figures just as fig 10 shows that the composite models are a good representation of the observed data at zero skew which may not be surprising considering the coefficients in the empirical portion of the composite model are computed from the zero skew data fig 11 demonstrates that the composite model holds for coaxial turbines in skew in this figure the measured power coefficient is plotted against the measured relative tsr at different skew angles along with the modified newman model and the edad model with two assumed values for the fresh flow induction factor the data represented in fig 11 were collected using the hh configuration of the dual rotor prototype in that configuration the twist distribution of the blades of the windward rotor is higher than the theoretically optimal twist distribution thus the hh configuration is the less efficient of the two configurations in this case the windward rotor is not retarding the flow sufficiently for the leeward rotor to be operating in its intended flow regime thus neither rotor is optimally extracting energy additionally a more efficient windward rotor would deflect the wake more strongly and reduce the wake area fraction thus with the less efficient rotor the proportion of leeward rotor exposed to fresh flow with skew is reduced the reduced efficiency and the reduced exposure to fresh flow combine to make the rotor extract less energy at high skew angles as demonstrated by the lower right panel of fig 11 nonetheless the composite model does describe the observations well for most cases and the edad model with the fresh flow induction factor equal to the windward induction factor seems to be the better description at low skew angles although it is difficult to distinguish the edad model from the modified newman model at lower skew angles the edad model appears to be a slightly better fit and the observations generally fall between the modified newman model and the maximum of the edad model e f 1 3 at the high 40 skew angle both the edad and modified newman models overestimate the mean of the observations in all cases the windward induction factor seems to be a better estimate of the fresh flow induction factor than the optimal value i e 1 3 and it is likely that the actual induction factor value is somewhere between the two in contrast the lh configuration is designed such that the windward rotor has a theoretically optimal twist distribution for the unperturbed flow and the leeward rotor has a twist distribution designed for the flow conditions in the wake of the windward rotor for this more efficient design the appropriateness of the composite model is more apparent furthermore fig 12 shows that the fresh flow phenomenon must be considered when modeling dual rotor coaxial systems in skew if the leeward rotor were completely in the wake of the windward rotor during operation in skew the modified newman model would be a good representation however fig 12 clearly shows that the modified newman model underpredicts the power particularly at skew angles greater than about 10 degrees likely because the simple cosine cubed modification does not capture the process of the leeward rotor emerging from the low energy wake of the windward rotor thus with the more efficient twist distributions the edad composite model appears to be more appropriate than the simple cosine cubed modification commonly used to estimate the effect of skew on the power production of current energy converters 5 conclusions harvesting the vast and renewable resource of ocean current hydrokinetic energy will require creative solutions to numerous challenges the tethered dual rotor coaxial turbine is a promising approach but without a complex structure providing reaction loads to counter the perturbations in orientation imposed by a turbulent ocean the tethered system is likely to operate at times in skew with the angle of skew fluctuating with the turbulence previous analytical work speculated that rather than being a problem to avoid operating a coaxial turbine in skew may have benefits due to the fresh flow phenomenon where a portion of the leeward rotor emerges from the wake of the windward rotor the results of the current work demonstrate that the fresh flow phenomenon does occur when a coaxial turbine operates in skew and therefore may be exploited although the existence of the fresh flow effect was confirmed evidence that operation in skew results in a net increase in power was not found therefore the conclusion that operation of a coaxial turbine in skew is necessarily desirable over operation without skew is not reached however this work demonstrates that the edad model represents the power production in skew better than an ad hoc trigonometric modification to the newman model according to the edad model with the proper induction factors and rotor separation distance the turbine will produce more power in skew than when aligned therefore it is reasonable to conclude that a careful iterative rotor design process to effectively tailor the induction factors will lead to a turbine design that reliably produces more power when in skew specifically between about 10 and 20 degrees the composite model created by integration of the edad model and the supplementary induction model describes the power dynamics well for the specific coaxial turbine that was designed in the conditions in which it was operated although it is based on an idealization and an assumed relationship between induction and rotor speed that may not hold outside of the measured range the results show that the semi empirical composite model is an approach that is appropriate for describing the power dynamics of a turbine configuration therefore a composite model could be combined with others in a comprehensive system model to study other domains such as the dynamics and stability of a tethered coaxial system these results demonstrate that the edad model captures the salient effects of the fresh flow phenomenon and that the fresh flow effect must be considered when designing coaxial turbine systems that may operate in skew the semi empirical composite model presented is useful for application to modeling and simulation of tethered coaxial dual

21557,ocean currents are a potentially reliable source of renewable energy but the complications associated with deploying current energy conversion cec devices in deep water make harvesting that energy a challenge one promising approach is to use tethered axial flow cecs composed of one or more pairs of coaxial counter rotating turbines however a dual rotor system moored in unsteady water by a flexible tether is likely to experience a condition called skew where the axis of rotation is not aligned with the direction of flow a lab scale turbine was constructed to investigate the effect of skew on fluid power conversion of a coaxial cec a semi empirical model of the power conversion was developed for comparing the results to a recently published analytical model it was found that the analytical model represents the data better than a simple ad hoc modification to previous models that is often used to estimate the power dynamics additionally the results support the existence of a physical phenomenon captured by the recent model but not represented in the ad hoc modification in which the downstream rotor of a coaxial pair is partially within the wake and partially out of the

untapped potential source of renewable energy the gulf stream current flows along the eastern united states and is nearest the mainland off the coasts of florida and north carolina haas 2013 the power density of the gulf stream near cape hatteras nc is estimated to be 500 1000 w m2 bane et al 2017 and it has been suggested that as much as one gigawatt of hydrokinetic power may be extracted from the gulf stream without significant disruption of climatic conditions yang 2013 conventional fluid kinetic energy conversion systems such as bladed turbines may be applied for capturing the power in ocean currents current energy converters cecs for wind are a mature technology wind turbines are typically mounted on towers however with the gulf stream current sometimes flowing over deep sea waters that may be 3000 meters or deeper haas 2013 bane et al 2017 a vertical cantilever tower is not a feasible means for fixing a cec to the sea bed in the ocean currents along the continental shelf a moored i e tethered approach may be a feasible alternative to the rigid tower for anchoring ocean cecs underwater moorings are easier to install and maintain than rigid structures but tethers are unable to provide the stabilizing reaction loads of towers and an unstable tethered system may be prone to entanglement however clever design and integration of one or more pairs of counter rotating rotors in a single vehicle system can result in zero net torque and or angular momentum usui et al 2013 thus mitigating the entanglement issue and eliminating the need for a tower furthermore tethered coaxial turbines tend to self align with the direction of flow clarke et al 2010 nonetheless without the rigid structure tethered systems are more susceptible to attitude perturbations in the still fluctuating ocean currents in general turbines are designed to operate in a specific orientation e g with the plane of rotation perpendicular to the flow for horizontal axis axial flow turbines any perturbation to the attitude of a turbine results in a condition called skew where the axis of rotation is not properly aligned with respect to the flow the effect of skew on the overall power conversion performance of wind farms has been investigated for tandem turbine configurations where the alignment of each rotor with the direction of flow is independent and it has been demonstrated that an increase in power conversion of as much as 12 percent may be realized with an upstream turbine operating in skew and a downstream turbine aligned with the freestream direction adaramola and krogstad 2011 however performance of the coupled system depends also on the properties of the operational environment and operation of the non coaxial upstream turbine in skew may or may not result in greater power conversion ozbay 2014 the flow alignment of the rotors comprising a multi rotor system is mechanically coupled and the dual rotor approach has received a considerable amount of attention partially because the net angular momentum and torque of the system may be reduced and potentially eliminated by having each rotor turn in opposite directions clarke et al 2007 dual rotor fluid energy conversion systems may be classified broadly as either coaxial or not coaxial coaxial turbines are characterized by a common axis of rotation for all rotors in the system non coaxial turbines have rotors with axes of rotation that are not collinear whether or not they are coaxial dual rotor machines may be designed such that the nominal direction of flow is along the axis i e axial flow or perpendicular to the flow i e transverse flow the axial and transverse flow machines are commonly known as horizontal axis and vertical axis respectively because of their usual orientation with respect to the horizon both coaxial didane et al 2018 and non coaxial li and calıcsal 2010 li and calisal 2011 vertical axis dual rotor systems have been studied and both show potential for improvement in performance over single rotor turbines for example both the overall power and torque of the dual rotor coaxial machine were increased by more than threefold over a similar single rotor system didane et al 2018 similarly constructive hydrodynamic interactions could result in a doubling of the efficiency of a non coaxial dual rotor vertical axis turbine over a similar single rotor machine li and calıcsal 2010 however with their axis of rotation perpendicular to the direction of flow vertical axis turbines may require considerable additional structure for use in tethered applications and thus may be more appropriate for shallower tidal waters than open ocean currents horizontal axis machines have rotors that are designed such that the axis of rotation is nominally aligned with the direction of flow horizontal axis cecs with non coaxial rotors are sometimes referred to as side by side or parallel plane machines parallel plane dual rotor turbines have been deployed on structures fixed to the seabed for tidal energy conversion fraenkel 2010 and have been proposed as tethered devices for ocean current energy conversion chen et al 2015 coiro et al 2017 2018 vanzwieten et al 2006 wu et al 2019 however in their intended operation there is no hydrodynamic interaction between rotors in the parallel plane turbines thus notwithstanding farm applications they lose any advantage that constructive interaction may present additionally unlike the coaxial devices where torque transmission is in torsion through a shaft torque between two parallel plane rotors is transmitted in bending requiring additional structure fleming 2015 by contrast coaxial dual rotor turbines have the potential for improved aero hydrodynamic performance one concept is to extract the flow power that remains in the wake after the fluid has passed through the rotor plane in his seminal work newman demonstrated that the theoretical limit of power extraction for two rotor disks of equal diameter is about 8 greater than the limit for a single rotor disk newman 1983 and later extended that work to show that the increase is limited to 13 for an infinite number of disks newman 1986 an investigation of this concept for wind energy conversion found that when they are aligned with the direction of flow coaxial counter rotating turbines convert more power than both single rotor and co rotating dual rotor systems because the leeward rotor is able to harness some of the kinetic energy associated with the swirling wake of the windward rotor ozbay et al 2015 another idea investigated for wind turbines is to use auxiliary rotors to extract energy from otherwise underexploited flow in a single rotor horizontal axis turbine the portion of blade nearest the axis of rotation i e the blade root is called the blade dead zone because the relative flow speed is lower than it is in regions closer to the tip and because structural considerations typically require a less efficient section shape at the root improved exploitation of the freestream fluid power may be possible through use of a smaller auxiliary rotor which has the working portions of its blades in the dead zone of the main rotor it has been estimated that a 9 increase could be realized using this approach jung et al 2005 others have extended the concept of an auxiliary rotor to address both the dead zone losses and wake retrieval rosenberg et al 2014 and have shown that the unsteady loads on the primary rotor do not increase significantly with use of an auxiliary rotor upstream moghadassian et al 2016 coaxial cecs for both wind e g jung et al 2005 kanemoto and galal 2006 habash et al 2011 rosenberg et al 2014 wang et al 2016 moghadassian et al 2016 thelen et al 2018 and hydrokinetic energy conversion e g clarke et al 2007 charles 2009 huang and kanemoto 2015 borthwick 2016 funami et al 2017 have been studied although dual rotor coaxial turbines can convert more power than a single rotor habash et al 2011 the modest efficiency gains achieved by coaxial turbines may be more relevant for wind energy conversion than for ocean currents in ocean applications deployment and maintenance costs tend to dominate the economic analysis neary et al 2014 and the benefits of a single point mooring may be more impactful than the increases in power production for a coaxial dual rotor cec with a fixed attitude system properties such as the blade pitch and the separation distance between rotors impact the power conversion performance wei et al 2015 however as previously noted tethered cecs are more susceptible to alignment disturbances than fixed systems and variation in attitude i e skew is known to affect the performance of horizontal axis turbines to better understand how attitude perturbations affect the power conversion performance of a coaxial turbine khatri et al extended the multiple actuator disk theory newman 1986 to a system of two coaxial actuator disks operating in skew khatri et al 2019 we call the extension the extended dual actuator disk edad model from analysis of the extended theory the authors found that under optimal conditions the total power converted by a dual rotor coaxial system operating in skew is greater than the power converted by the same system when the axis of rotation is aligned with the direction of flow see fig 8 in khatri et al 2019 this finding is in contrast to the monotonic decrease in extracted power with skew by a single turbine system wang et al 2019 schulz et al 2017 tongchitpakdee et al 2005 although the effects of a single non coaxial turbine in skew in a tandem rotor system have been studied and the power dynamics of counter rotating rotors have been examined when they are aligned with the direction of flow coaxial turbines in skew have not been thoroughly investigated the objective of this work was to experimentally measure the power dynamics of a dual rotor coaxial turbine operating in skew and to compare the results to the edad model developed by khatri et al this paper describes the approach to the investigation beginning with a brief discussion of the theoretical background and the edad model followed by a presentation of the results with discussion 2 theoretical background and the edad model when a rotor operates in a moving fluid the velocity of the fluid is affected by the presence of the rotor in the axial single actuator disk theory a single parameter typically referred to as the induction factor quantifies the relationship between the magnitude of the fluid velocity at the three boundaries of two regions of the flow the two flow regions are upstream and downstream of the disk and the boundaries are far upstream in the rotor plane and far downstream the single actuator disk theory employs conservation of momentum and mass continuity to describe the fluid velocity at the rotor plane and far downstream from the rotor as a function of the induction factor and the known freestream velocity betz 2013 the induction factor is a measure of the change in the speed of the fluid that is induced by the rotor thus it is a measure of the transfer of kinetic energy between the flow and the rotor when a rotor is operating to add energy to the fluid as in propulsion the induced change is an increase in velocity of the fluid conversely when a rotor is operating to extract energy from the fluid as with a turbine the induced change is a retardation of the flow newman extended the single actuator disk theory first to two actuators newman 1983 and then to an infinite number of disks representing a series of coaxial rotors newman 1986 like the single actuator disk model newman s model relates the velocity at the boundaries of regions of the flow using induction factors where the number of induction factors necessary to describe the relationship between velocities is equal to the number of rotors for example in a two rotor model two induction factors define the flow speed at the boundaries between three regions of flow as a fraction of the freestream speed the three regions shown in the left panel of fig 1 are a upstream b between and c downstream and the four boundaries are far upstream in the plane of the windward rotor in the plane of the leeward rotor and downstream the first induction factor describes the relationship between the flow speed far upstream of the windward rotor left side of region a in the plane of the windward rotor between regions a and b and downstream of the windward rotor but upstream of the leeward rotor region b the second induction factor describes the relationship between the flow speed between the rotors region b in the plane of the leeward rotor between regions b and c and far downstream of the leeward rotor right side of region c these two induction factors may be described as the windward and leeward induction factors respectively both the single actuator disk model described by betz 2013 and the multi disk model developed by newman 1986 assume that the actuator disks are perpendicular with the direction of flow i e that the axis of rotation of a rotor represented by the actuator disk is aligned with the flow the edad model extends the dual actuator disk model to account for operation in skew when the axis of rotation is at angle with respect to the direction of flow khatri et al 2019 as demonstrated conceptually by the right panel in fig 1 when a dual coaxial rotor system operates in skew the leeward rotor may emerge from the wake of the windward rotor and create two additional flow regions a region upstream of the exposed portion of the leeward rotor and an region downstream of the exposed portion region d and region e in the right panel of fig 1 respectively the third induction factor which may be described as the fresh flow induction factor describes the relationship between the fluid velocity at the outside boundaries of these additional regions and in the plane of the exposed portion of the leeward rotor the physical result of the leeward rotor emerging from the wake is that for the portion of the rotor experiencing fresh flow there is a larger amount of kinetic energy available in the fluid than for the portion of the rotor that is within the wake if the leeward rotor is able to harvest the additional energy the total power generated by the dual rotor system may be greater than it would be if the leeward rotor were to remain in the wake of the windward rotor the power p r e f available in a fluid of density ρ flowing with freestream velocity v through an area of interest a is expressed as eq 1 the rate of flow of kinetic energy through the area white 1999 1 p r e f 1 2 ρ a v 3 from the rankine froude axial momentum theory the power available to an actuator disk of area a is given by eq 2 where e is the axial induction factor defined as the ratio of the axial fluid speed at the disk to the axial freestream speed spera 2009 2 p 2 ρ a e 1 e 2 v 3 in the classical actuator disk theory eq 1 is typically used as a reference for eq 2 to compute the formula for the nondimensional power coefficient c p 4 e 1 e 2 for a single rotor operating in skew at angle θ with respect to the direction of flow assuming that the rotor can only extract energy in the axial direction then only the axial component of the velocity at the rotor plane is contributing to the available power in this case v in eq 2 is replaced by v a x i a l v c o s θ and normalization by the reference power of eq 1 provides an estimate for how the power of a single rotor may change with skew given by eq 3 3 c p p a x i a l p r e f 4 e 1 e 2 c o s 3 θ eq 3 suggests that a simple modification of the single actuator disk model by the cube of the cosine of the skew angle is sufficient to describe the power dynamics at small angles i e less than 30 degrees observed power may deviate significantly from the cosine cubed modification of the axial momentum theory particularly during dynamic skew wang et al 2019 and more sophisticated treatments such as the glauert lift correction or the vortex cylinder model may be more accurate burton 2011 however empirical power data for a single rotor are well described over a large range of skew angles by the cosine cubed modification e g fig 5 20 in spera 2009 if the power extracted by a single rotor in skew can be estimated by modification of the single actuator disk model by the cube of the cosine of the skew angle then it is reasonable to assume that the same is true for the dual disk model however such a modification of newman s dual rotor model neglects the fresh flow effect described above by contrast the edad model captures the fresh flow effect resulting in an increase in predicted power conversion as demonstrated graphically in fig 2 according to the edad model a turbine with equal diameter rotors separated by a distance of one half of the diameter has a theoretical maximum power coefficient of 0 677 at 11 degrees skew an increase of 5 72 over the theoretical maximum of 0 64 at zero skew to generate fig 2 the windward and leeward induction factors in both the modified newman and edad models are set at the optimal zero skew values of 1 5 and 3 5 respectively khatri et al 2019 three different values for the fresh flow induction factor in the edad model are used to generate the three curves in the figure the most power is predicted when the fresh flow induction factor is at the optimal value 1 3 dotted line khatri et al 2019 slightly less power is predicted when the fresh flow induction factor is at the maximum value allowed by momentum theory 1 2 dashed line but there is still an increase with skew power coefficient of 0 66 at 9 degrees vs 0 64 at zero skew if the fresh flow portion of the leeward rotor is not inducing any change to the fluid velocity i e induction is 0 dot dashed line then it is not extracting energy and only the portion in the wake of the windward rotor is contributing to the total power produced in the newman model the power coefficient is maximized by a windward induction factor of 0 2 and a leeward induction factor of 0 6 resulting is a power coefficient value of 0 64 newman 1983 the solid line in fig 2 shows how the power coefficient of the newman model diminishes monotonically when modified by the cube of the cosine of the skew angle likewise there is a monotonic decrease in power with skew predicted by the edad model when the windward and leeward induction factors are 0 2 and 0 6 respectively and the value of the fresh flow induction factor is small i e when the fresh flow portion of the leeward rotor is not extracting much energy from the fluid not surprisingly the total power predicted by the edad model is also less than that predicted by the modified newman model when the fresh flow induction factor is zero because only the portion of the leeward rotor that is in the wake of the windward rotor is contributing to the total power production by contrast when the fresh flow induction factor is at the optimal value 1 3 the dotted line in fig 2 the power increases with skew to a maximum value at around 12 degrees and then decreases with any additional skew the nonmonotonic curve suggests that for a given dual rotor coaxial turbine under certain conditions there is an optimum non zero skew angle where the power produced is greater than it would be if the system were aligned with the flow the induction of a spinning rotor is a function of both the geometry e g the shape size and number of blades and the rate at which it spins consequently the situations depicted in fig 2 are all physically difficult to realize as the dual rotor system experiences skew in a constant current the axial component of the flow velocity diminishes the rotor spins slower and the induction factor changes similarly as the leeward rotor emerges from the wake of the windward rotor during skew the exposed portion is in a different region of flow fig 1 as the rotor spins sections of different blades will enter and exit the fresh flow fig 1 right d and e and wake fig 1 right b and c regions of the flow in order to maintain a constant induction factor for the entire rotor each blade would need to dynamically morph into a new geometry as it passes into a new flow region during a cycle of rotation which is obviously problematic however fig 2 is nonetheless instructive because it demonstrates the theoretical maximum and shows that the edad model can capture the hypothesized fresh flow phenomenon whereas existing actuator disk models do not the fresh flow induction factor is independent of the area of the exposed portion of the leeward turbine however the power produced by the dual rotor coaxial turbine in skew does depend on how much of the leeward rotor is exposed thus khatri et al developed a formulation for the wake area fraction given by eq 5 that depends on the geometry of the system e g the rotor diameter and the distance between the rotors the skew angle and the values of the windward and leeward induction factors in developing the formulation for wake area fraction khatri et al assumed a cylindrical stream tube i e no wake expansion therefore the edad model overestimates the wake deflection of the windward rotor and thus underpredicts the wake area fraction at a given skew angle or equivalently overpredicts the proportion of leeward rotor exposed to fresh flow as a result the edad model provides a boundary of expected power production for a real dual rotor turbine operating in skew the change in axial component of flow speed due to skew is the same for all sections of the coaxial rotors however the portion of leeward rotor remaining in the wake of the windward rotor is reduced with skew therefore at any fixed value for the leeward induction factor the portion of the rotor will have less area and will thus convert less power the power converted by the overall system however depends also on the power converted by the portion of the leeward rotor exposed to fresh flow if the fresh flow induction factor is zero then the overall system will convert less power than if the entire leeward rotor were within the wake as demonstrated by the dot dash line in fig 2 if the value of the fresh flow induction factor is 1 3 rd i e that portion of the leeward rotor is optimally extracting power then the system will be converting more power than it would have been if the leeward rotor were entirely in the wake this is true even if the portion of the leeward rotor in the wake is optimally extracting power because the kinetic energy is higher in the freestream flow than it is in the wake of the windward rotor in practice the fresh flow induction factor is unlikely to be zero although it is possible e g a slowly rotating single bladed turbine furthermore it is reasonable to assume that at any rotation speed the fresh flow induction factor would be similar in value to the windward induction factor if the two rotors are of similar geometry because the exposed portion of the leeward rotor is experiencing similar flow therefore it is reasonable to suggest that the observed power coefficient of a real rotor would be somewhere between that predicted by the newman model and the value predicted by the edad model when the value of the fresh flow induction factor is 1 3 rd the power coefficient for a dual rotor system similar to eq 3 for a single rotor is defined as the ratio of the power produced by both rotors to the reference power given by eq 1 the equation for the power coefficient of the edad model is given by eq 4 where α is the wake area fraction e w is the windward induction factor e l is the leeward induction factor e f is the fresh flow induction factor and θ is the skew angle khatri et al 2019 when α is equal to one i e the leeward rotor is completely in the wake of the windward rotor 4 reduces to the modified newman model and when θ is also zero i e no skew 4 is exactly the dual turbine model described by newman newman 1983 4 c p p p r e f 4 cos 3 θ 2 α 1 e w 2 e w α 1 e l 2 e l 2 e w 1 α 1 e f 2 e f the edad curves in fig 2 are constructed using eq 4 the meticulous observer may notice a slight kink in the curve representing the power when the fresh flow induction factor is at the optimal value edad 1 3 dotted line located just past 50 degrees of skew that is the point at which the leeward rotor fully emerges from the wake of the windward rotor thus the wake area fraction reaches a minimum value of zero and the power diminishes as the cosine cubed of the skew angle as if both disks were independent the wake area fraction described by 5 is defined as the fraction of the leeward rotor that is within the wake of the windward rotor in 5 d is the distance between the rotors d is the diameter of the rotors and all other symbols are as described previously 5 α 1 2 tan θ 2 e w e l d d a full treatment of the derivation of 4 and 5 may be found in khatri et al 2019 3 materials and methods a prototype dual rotor coaxial cec system was designed and built to measure the mechanical rotary power converted from the fluid flow power the prototype system was mounted in a controlled flow environment and observations were made under various conditions the data collected were reduced and applied towards analysis of the actuator disk models through construction of a semi empirical composite model 3 1 dual rotor prototype to maximize the reconfigurability of the prototype the reusability of components and the overall usefulness of the experimental platform the principle of hierarchical modularity was applied to develop the dual rotor cec system lipson 2007 the modules at the top layer include the body and rotors secondary modules within the body module include components for actuation and sensing and the rotors modules contain blade units at the secondary level further down the hierarchical levels are modules that are not physically separable from the blade units but are nonetheless independent from a design perspective these modules include the blades and the airfoils 3 1 1 rotor conceptually a rotor is made up of one or more blades though in practice a single bladed rotor is problematic the two major design parameters of the rotor are the number of blades and the radius a three bladed rotor was chosen for its axial symmetry and resistance to cogging in skew operation khatri et al 2018 the rotor radius was designed to maximize power conversion while falling within the constraints imposed by the open channel water tunnel at north carolina state university the water tunnel test section has a nominal cross section of 81 by 61 cm 32 by 24 inches stewart 2017 under optimal conditions the wake behind the rotor expands by a factor of about three spera 2009 therefore a rotor diameter of 20 3 cm 8 inches was selected to minimize the possibility of wake wall interactions propagating upstream and corrupting the measurements 3 1 2 blade units the blade units are composed of the blades and an incorporated hub portion that facilitates rotor assembly see bottom fig 3 the blades are designed as a series of constant chord airfoils with a specified orientation to define the spanwise twist distribution the sg6040 airfoil was selected for its favorable performance at lower reynolds numbers lyon et al 1997 the twist distribution was designed by first calculating a target tip speed ratio λ o according to the approach described in ragheb and m 2011 using a value of 2 for the ratio of rotor radius to upstream flow perturbation length 6 note that the target tip speed ratio in this context is a parameter in the blade twist function and not necessarily the tip speed ratio at which rotor power will be at a maximum 6 λ o ω o r v 2 π n r s the spanwise twist distribution is computed from the target tip speed ratio the twist angle is given as a function of the spanwise coordinate by eq 7 ragheb and m 2011 the target angle of attack α o is chosen to maximize the lift to drag ratio for the airfoil lyon et al 1997 7 σ arctan 2 r 3 λ o r α o eq 7 was used to design two twist distributions one with λ o 4 3 π the theoretical optimum for a three bladed rotor and another using λ o 2 the latter was chosen because it results in a higher twist angle as demonstrated by fig 3 thus reducing the cut in speed of the rotor likely at the expense of efficiency although efficiency was not a concern for this work the two twist distributions were used in two different dual rotor system configurations one where the mean twist angle of the windward rotor is high and another where it is low the mean twist angle of the leeward rotor is high in both configurations 3 1 3 body an analysis of the edad model indicates that when the distance between the two rotors is approximately half of their diameter there may be an enhanced performance zone where the net power converted in skew operation is increased and insensitive to small variations in orientation khatri et al 2019 the minimum length of the prototype is restricted by the dimensions of the internal components and the rotor diameter is constrained by the water tunnel test section to about 20 cm 8 inches the achieved rotor to rotor distance of the prototype was 10 2 cm 4 02 inches or about half of the rotor diameter the central housing components include a cylindrical shell and end caps the shell is made of a clear polycarbonate cylinder that allows for observation of moisture sensing indicator strips inside of the body during underwater operation the inner end caps are machined from martensitic stainless steel and the outer end caps are 3d printed with verowhite plus rgd 835 chosen for its low moisture absorption coefficient compared to other compatible polymers using an objet30 printer stratasys ltd edina mn the major components of the apparatus are labeled in fig 4 the rotary shaft power is transmitted through the hermetically sealed end caps using a custom built magnetic torque coupling system fig 4 which enables complete enclosure of the electronics data and power are transferred to and from the sealed enclosure by wires which pass through the sealed end caps a section view of a cad rendering of the prototype is shown in fig 4 3 1 4 instrumentation the instrumentation hardware within one half of the body tube is composed of a hb 20m magnetic hysteresis brake magtrol inc west seneca ny usa a qta141 torque sensor futek inc irvine ca usa and a kma210 magnetoresistive angular position sensor nxp semiconductors eindhoven nl this arrangement ensures that both the windward and leeward rotors have a separate dedicated set of instruments which are used to actuate or record data independently the instrument wiring passes through the body endcaps and is routed through the hollow sting and connected to an externally located data acquisition system described in 3 2 the purpose of the brake is to simulate the mechanical load of an electrical generator the hysteresis brake was chosen for the ability to control the torque remotely and because it has near zero torque when there is no applied electrical current the torque was modulated by manually adjusting the applied current using a laboratory power supply the orientation of the rotor was measured using the angular position sensor and the angles were used to compute the mean angular rate between samples 3 2 data collection the experimental prototype was secured to a rigid sting and mounted on an electronically controlled rotary stage above the test section of the north carolina state university free surface water tunnel stewart 2017 a cad rendering of the water tunnel is shown in fig 5 and fig 6 shows the prototype turbine mounted on the sting attached to the rotary stage in the water tunnel the nominal depth of the test section is 610 mm 24 inches and the width is 810 mm 32 inches a 7 5 kw 10 hp baldor reliance super e em3774t motor controlled by an acs355 variable frequency drive abb powers flow through a 4 5 1 contraction providing a velocity range from 0 15 1 0 m s with an average streamwise turbulence varying linearly from 0 2 to 0 9 along the 2 4 m 96 inches length of the glass panels stewart 2017 data were captured using a standalone data acquisition system with a pxi 8102 embedded controller in tandem with a 24 bit pxi 4462 module for multichannel recording and managed through a custom virtual instrument vi running on labview software national instruments austin tx usa all data were sampled at 1000 hz hardware synchronized and recorded to file using the custom vi the experimental procedure began with calibration of the zero skew angle and recording of the no load signal from the torque sensors for systematic error detection then the fluid velocity in the tunnel was brought to 0 5 m s next the current setting on the brake power supplies was modulated until the target signal was obtained from the torque sensors on the upstream and downstream rotors finally the rotary stage motor was used to set the prototype to a desired angle of skew upon achieving each skew angle following a brief period of time to allow damping of transient phenomena the sensor signals were sampled for 10 s and then the skew angle was increased to the next increment the procedure was repeated at incremental skew angles in both directions until a rotor stalled typically the leeward rotor for both of the two twist distributions of the upstream rotor table 1 shows the experimental input parameter values for the high high twist turbine and table 2 shows the values for the low high twist turbine 3 3 data reduction the ten seconds of torque and angular position data for the windward and leeward rotors per collection period were reduced to a mean torque and angular rate for each rotor to reduce the torque data the signals were first post processed through the matlab mathworks natick ma minimum order low pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 20 hz to remove noise after filtering the first and last one thousand samples two seconds of data were rejected and the remaining eight thousand samples eight seconds of data were reduced to the quadratic mean and the standard deviation the angular position data were converted to an angular rate using the matlab discrete fast fourier transform fft algorithm 3 3 1 uncertainty estimation prior to and following each sweep of skew angles in either direction and with the water tunnel still the systematic error in the torque measurement was obtained by removing current from the electric brakes and sampling the torque sensor signals for 10 s the total systematic error for each sweep of skew angles given in table 1 and table 2 for the low high and high high rotor twist turbine configurations respectively is estimated as the root mean square of the two collections of no torque samples bracketing the sweep the imprecision error in the torque measurement is estimated as the standard deviation over the sample period the speed imprecision error is similarly estimated as the standard deviation in the numerical derivative of the angular position over the sample period finally the combined measurement uncertainty in the power coefficient shown as error bars in figs 10 11 and 12 is estimated from the combined coefficient of variation 3 4 supplementary model both the modified newman and edad models estimate power from the values of induction factors and the skew angle neither model includes properties of physical rotors such as blade number twist distribution or rotation speed therefore these physical properties cannot be used as model inputs for comparison to observation making a direct connection between the models and empirical data challenging to convert the physical properties of the rotors to values of induction that can be used as model inputs we developed a supplementary empirical model of induction as a function of the rotation speed or tip speed ratio the mechanical shaft power developed by the spinning rotor given by eq 8 is the product of the torque τ and the angular rate ω 8 p s τ ω τ λ v r considering the relationship between torque and total hydrodynamic force at a given spanwise location along the blade a comparison of the equations for the mechanical shaft power 8 and the change in fluid power across the actuator disk for a single turbine system 2 suggests that induction may be linear in λ when the angle between the axis of rotation and the total hydrodynamic force is small for a dual turbine system a similar comparison suggests that the windward induction may be linear in the windward tip speed ratio λ w and the leeward induction may be linear in both the leeward tip speed ratio λ l and the windward induction factor thus we postulate a linear model for induction shown in eq 9 where the values of coefficients a 1 a 2 b 1 b 2 and b 3 are determined empirically 9 e w a 1 λ w a 2 e l b 1 λ l b 2 e w b 3 the relationship between the power coefficient and the rotor speed is complicated and non linear however the concavity of the curve is well established and the shape remains concave when a single rotor operates in skew bahaj et al 2007 therefore the appropriateness of the linear model of induction as a function of λ is verified by constructing the power coefficient curve from the linear induction model in composition with the single actuator disk model as given by eq 10 10 c p 4 e 1 e 2 4 a 1 λ a 2 1 a 1 λ a 2 2 the result of eq 10 when a 1 0 1 and a 2 1 is shown as fig 7 as expected the curve is concave and it is of a similar shape to the qualitative curves used in textbooks for demonstration spera 2009 as well as the empirical curves used in modeling and simulation slootweg et al 2003 agarwal et al 2010 de kooning et al 2013 finally the postulated relationship between λ and the induction factors may be exploited to compare experimental data to the analytical models through construction of a semi empirical composite model where the coefficients of eq 9 are determined by induction factors that are calculated from the measured mechanical power when the dual rotor system is in skew the total power converted depends on the wake area fraction which is a function of both induction factors as well as the induction by the exposed portion of the leeward rotor thus there is no unique solution for the induction factors when the system is in skew however when the dual rotor system is aligned with the flow the wake area fraction is unity and eq 4 may be separated into two equations for windward and leeward power equation 11 11 c p w 4 e w 1 e w 2 c p l 4 1 e l 2 e l 2 e w the induction factors at zero skew for a measured shaft power are computed by first solving for the three roots of the windward power function and then neglecting those that are infeasible according to momentum disk theory i e 0 e w 0 5 then the realizable windward induction factors are substituted into the leeward power function and the leeward induction factors are determined from the allowable roots 2 e w e l 0 5 e w next the computed induction factors are compared to the measured tip speed ratios using 9 and the values of the coefficients a 1 a 2 b 1 b 2 and b 3 are determined by a least squares fit lastly eq 9 with the empirically determined coefficient values is combined with either the edad model or the modified newman model to construct a semi empirical composite model of power coefficient as a function tip speed ratio for the newman model the coefficient values are all that is required to construct the power coefficient curves producing curves using the edad model requires an additional value for the fresh flow induction factor which must be assumed 4 results and discussion the results of the supplementary linear induction model are discussed first followed by the results of the composite models 4 1 linear induction model the values for the coefficients a 1 a 2 b 1 b 2 and b 3 in 9 were calculated as described above the windward induction factors computed from the power observations are shown in fig 8 along with the resultant models for the two twist configurations as described in section 3 1 2 the lower twist configuration is the more efficient and is therefore able to extract a higher proportion of energy from the flow after cut in the lower twist rotor is also expected to rotate faster than the higher twist configuration in a flow of constant velocity accordingly the windward induction factor curve for the lower twist rotor is above and to the right of the windward induction curve for the higher twist rotor additionally the higher twist induction curve appears less linear than the lower twist curve the exact source of the nonlinearity is unknown but it may be due to a breakdown of the assumptions of the momentum disk theory for the higher twist rotor for example at lower rotation speed a rotor is less like an actuator disk than at high rotation speed furthermore wake rotation is neglected by the axial momentum theory but the higher twist rotor may be imparting a high level of vorticity to the wake relative to the induced velocity particularly at low rotation speeds in any case the linear model appears to be a decent representation of the windward induction factor for both configurations throughout the observed range of tip speed ratio the observations and resultant models for the leeward induction factors are shown in fig 9 with the higher twist configuration shown at the left and the lower twist configuration at the right the planar surfaces show the linear models as described by eq 9 with the empirically determined coefficient values again the linear model describes the data well for both configurations having determined the coefficient values for the supplementary induction models the measured mechanical power coefficients may now be plotted along with the power coefficient curve predicted by the composite actuator disk models for the two twist configurations as shown in fig 10 note that the newman and edad models are identical when skew is zero for brevity the dual rotor configuration with the lower twist windward and higher twist leeward rotors is referred to as the low high lh configuration and the version with both higher twist windward and leeward rotors is called the high high hh configuration fig 10 demonstrates that at zero skew the data are well described by the composite model the analytical power coefficient models include induction factors e w and e l as independent variables but not tsr the tip speed ratio is incorporated into the analytical models using the empirically determined linear relationship between induction factors and tsrs because it is the zero skew data that are applied to construct the supplementary induction models this figure also shows the range of relative tsr defined as the sum of the windward and leeward tsr for which this particular composite model is valid which is from about 7 5 to 9 7 for the lh twist configuration and between about 6 5 and 9 2 for the hh configuration 4 2 coaxial turbines in skew after determining the coefficient values for the linear induction model from the zero skew measurements the empirical model is combined with the actuator disk models to create a composite model which may be compared to the experimental observations over the full range of skew angles since the fresh flow induction factor e f in the edad model cannot be back calculated from the observations two assumed values for e f are considered first the case of e f e w and second the case of e f 1 3 the first case e f e w is chosen because the edad model assumes that the exposed portion of the downstream rotor is experiencing the same freestream flow as the upstream rotor and that they both modify the flow as a function of λ in the same way if both of the rotors are identical then it is reasonable to assume that the induction factor as a function of rotor speed is identical for both of course this assumes that not only is the fresh flow portion of the leeward rotor completely out of the wake but also that the wake has no effect on the surrounding fluid which is unlikely additionally the rotors are identical only in one of the two configurations tested therefore another case is included for comparison in the edad model the portion of the leeward rotor that has emerged from the wake of the windward rotor is treated the same as an isolated actuator disk which will convert the maximum amount of power when the induction factor is 1 3 therefore assuming e f 1 3 corresponds to the optimal case and yields the maximum power coefficient from the edad model and an upper bound on the composite model the lower bound of the composite model occurs when the fresh flow induction factor is zero i e when the exposed portion of the leeward rotor is not converting any power the lower bound is not included in the figures just as fig 10 shows that the composite models are a good representation of the observed data at zero skew which may not be surprising considering the coefficients in the empirical portion of the composite model are computed from the zero skew data fig 11 demonstrates that the composite model holds for coaxial turbines in skew in this figure the measured power coefficient is plotted against the measured relative tsr at different skew angles along with the modified newman model and the edad model with two assumed values for the fresh flow induction factor the data represented in fig 11 were collected using the hh configuration of the dual rotor prototype in that configuration the twist distribution of the blades of the windward rotor is higher than the theoretically optimal twist distribution thus the hh configuration is the less efficient of the two configurations in this case the windward rotor is not retarding the flow sufficiently for the leeward rotor to be operating in its intended flow regime thus neither rotor is optimally extracting energy additionally a more efficient windward rotor would deflect the wake more strongly and reduce the wake area fraction thus with the less efficient rotor the proportion of leeward rotor exposed to fresh flow with skew is reduced the reduced efficiency and the reduced exposure to fresh flow combine to make the rotor extract less energy at high skew angles as demonstrated by the lower right panel of fig 11 nonetheless the composite model does describe the observations well for most cases and the edad model with the fresh flow induction factor equal to the windward induction factor seems to be the better description at low skew angles although it is difficult to distinguish the edad model from the modified newman model at lower skew angles the edad model appears to be a slightly better fit and the observations generally fall between the modified newman model and the maximum of the edad model e f 1 3 at the high 40 skew angle both the edad and modified newman models overestimate the mean of the observations in all cases the windward induction factor seems to be a better estimate of the fresh flow induction factor than the optimal value i e 1 3 and it is likely that the actual induction factor value is somewhere between the two in contrast the lh configuration is designed such that the windward rotor has a theoretically optimal twist distribution for the unperturbed flow and the leeward rotor has a twist distribution designed for the flow conditions in the wake of the windward rotor for this more efficient design the appropriateness of the composite model is more apparent furthermore fig 12 shows that the fresh flow phenomenon must be considered when modeling dual rotor coaxial systems in skew if the leeward rotor were completely in the wake of the windward rotor during operation in skew the modified newman model would be a good representation however fig 12 clearly shows that the modified newman model underpredicts the power particularly at skew angles greater than about 10 degrees likely because the simple cosine cubed modification does not capture the process of the leeward rotor emerging from the low energy wake of the windward rotor thus with the more efficient twist distributions the edad composite model appears to be more appropriate than the simple cosine cubed modification commonly used to estimate the effect of skew on the power production of current energy converters 5 conclusions harvesting the vast and renewable resource of ocean current hydrokinetic energy will require creative solutions to numerous challenges the tethered dual rotor coaxial turbine is a promising approach but without a complex structure providing reaction loads to counter the perturbations in orientation imposed by a turbulent ocean the tethered system is likely to operate at times in skew with the angle of skew fluctuating with the turbulence previous analytical work speculated that rather than being a problem to avoid operating a coaxial turbine in skew may have benefits due to the fresh flow phenomenon where a portion of the leeward rotor emerges from the wake of the windward rotor the results of the current work demonstrate that the fresh flow phenomenon does occur when a coaxial turbine operates in skew and therefore may be exploited although the existence of the fresh flow effect was confirmed evidence that operation in skew results in a net increase in power was not found therefore the conclusion that operation of a coaxial turbine in skew is necessarily desirable over operation without skew is not reached however this work demonstrates that the edad model represents the power production in skew better than an ad hoc trigonometric modification to the newman model according to the edad model with the proper induction factors and rotor separation distance the turbine will produce more power in skew than when aligned therefore it is reasonable to conclude that a careful iterative rotor design process to effectively tailor the induction factors will lead to a turbine design that reliably produces more power when in skew specifically between about 10 and 20 degrees the composite model created by integration of the edad model and the supplementary induction model describes the power dynamics well for the specific coaxial turbine that was designed in the conditions in which it was operated although it is based on an idealization and an assumed relationship between induction and rotor speed that may not hold outside of the measured range the results show that the semi empirical composite model is an approach that is appropriate for describing the power dynamics of a turbine configuration therefore a composite model could be combined with others in a comprehensive system model to study other domains such as the dynamics and stability of a tethered coaxial system these results demonstrate that the edad model captures the salient effects of the fresh flow phenomenon and that the fresh flow effect must be considered when designing coaxial turbine systems that may operate in skew the semi empirical composite model presented is useful for application to modeling and simulation of tethered coaxial dual

21558,the golden horn estuary serves as a prominent symbol of istanbul s history its beauty and its richness considered the world s largest natural harbor the golden horn is an inlet of the bosphorus that geographically separates the historical center of istanbul from the rest of the city from its shining golden colored water at sunset to the horn shaped sheltered harbor it creates for thousands of years the golden horn estuary has been a major economic attraction and has served as a critical military advantage for its inhabitants the estuary connects the bosphorus strait with the sea of marmara and merges two rivers the kağıthane and alibeyköy despite its significance up until two decades ago the golden horn estuary was a victim of industrialization urban sprawl and considered a prime dumping spot for industrial waste most research of the golden horn has focused on its pollution in this paper we explore the hydrodynamics of the golden horn in this study a physical experimental hydrodynamic model of the golden horn is developed to explore four different scenarios of possible bridge structures to enhance travel and commerce routes these scenarios are i keeping the natural condition of the estuary without structure scenario 1 ii the presence of the atatürk unkapanı bridge scenario 2 iii the presence of a submerged bridge within the estuary scenarios 3 and iv both the atatürk unkapanı bridge and a submerged bridge existing in the estuary scenario 4 the structureless scenario is considered as a reference model to help evaluate the structural effects on the hydrodynamics of the golden horn for each scenario the physical experiments are conducted under flowrates 0 83 1 11 and 1 39 l per second and flow patterns of the golden horn investigated eddies shore flows and regional flows are identified and the effects of the structures revealed the results of this present study show that the floating bridge has the highest impact on the horizontal water flow double bridge presence in the estuary has a mild effect and the underwater bridge has relatively minor effects on the horizontal flow patterns of the golden horn keywords flow pattern physical experimental investigation golden horn velocity field hydrodynamic flow patterns 1 introduction the golden horn estuary is located in the heart of istanbul and has been a territory of invaluable significance in its city s history from the greek roman byzantine and ottoman empires the golden horn has protected trade ships and has been used to prevent unwanted ships from entering its harbor the golden horn starts from the embouchure of kağıthane and alibeyköy streams and ends at bosphorus strait the golden horn is located between eyüp and kağıthane districts at the northwest and fatih and beyoğlu districts at the southeast in this way the waters of the golden horn define the northern boundary of the peninsula constituting old istanbul ancient byzantium and constantinople this estuarial inlet geographically separates the historical center of istanbul from the rest of the city and forms a horn shaped sheltered harbor in the history of the byzantine empire 324 453 vol i and vol ii vasilyev 1952a b indicates the strategic military location of the golden horn that allowed its inhabitants protection from intruding naval attacks at times the entrance of the golden horn was clad with enormous chains to preserve the city against any naval strikes apart from its location the golden horn has always been the center of a densely populated city and as a result suffered from pollution coleman et al 2009 distinctly illustrated the ecological pollution of the golden horn chronologically from the fifteenth century to 2015 in their study they mention the inadequate and adverse effects on the water circulation of the estuary yerliyurt and hamamciglu 2005 noted that while golden horn is known for being a central part of the city and a place of immense economic and residential activity through the prost plan of 1933 industrialization and pollution of the golden horn began and continued until the mid to late 1990s inanc et al 1998 stated that until the 1930s a considerable amount of existing pollutants were due to sediment deposition however in addition to this industrial pollution and dense urbanization akten 2003 2004 and guven et al 2005 report that ship accidents in the bosphorus such as 1979 accident at the south part of bosphorus and other maritime operations contributed to the contamination of the golden horn sarikaya et al 1997 highlight an abundance of human waste chemicals and heavy metals discharged into the golden horn and listed the quantity of each contaminant according to the 1995 regulations and found the microbial contamination of the estuary to be extremely high pollution was so extreme that the air around its shores became unbreathable at times many studies focused on the pollution of the golden horn the first comprehensive study was a ph d dissertation by kor 1963 who analyzed the pollution and oxygenation concentration the sediment layer and their effects özsoy et al 1988 addressed that the surface layer of the golden horn carries such dense suspended sediment particles so that sunrays are mostly absorbed the study of ergin et al 1991 concentrated on suspended heavy metal sediments at the top of the water layer of the golden horn and izmit bay in contrast to izmit bay golden horn is found to be more densely contaminated with metal pollution the study focused on the reasons for the extreme heavy metal pollution and their influence on the discharging streams of the golden horn another study by sur et al 2002 investigated the oceanographic properties of the golden horn and the golden horn rehabilitation project they highlighted the detrimental effects of the old floating bridge the valide sultan bridge müftüoğlu 2002 comprehensively analyzed the golden horn in terms of physical oceanography the monthly datasets of velocity salinity and temperature were assessed to provide a better understanding of the oceanographic properties of the golden horn at the entrance bosphorus side of the golden horn galata bridge the top layer salinity was observed as 18 20 practical salinity unit psu due to the winds at the depth while at the bottom layer 15 and 25 m the salinity was 38 psu in past years the daily discharge of alibeyköy and kağıthane streams has decreased and due to the reduced discharge features of the upper layer of the golden horn have become similar to the black sea water characteristics the inflow into the golden horn and outflow throughout the bosphorus discharges of the golden horn were calculated as 494 59 m3 s and 417 75 m3 s respectively muftuoglu 2002 resulting in a 15 5 difference between inflow and outflow which is considered to be an acceptable range altunkaynak et al 2005 conducted another study to highlight the changes in the amount of oxygen present in the golden horn water body via a logical model they listed the pollution level of the golden horn and developed a fuzzy logic model for the prediction of monthly dissolved oxygen do müftüoğlu 2008 described the layered flow of the golden horn and estimated the opposite directional flows also he explained that inside and outside flows observed at the eminönü and karaköy shores vary with seasons and temperatures and that the salinity of the golden horn has not changed in years 38 psu at the bottom layer and 18 20 psu at the surface layer at the golden horn entrance additionally although the surface layer temperature is susceptible to the weather conditions it is highlighted that the bottom layer temperature remains at 15 c during the year the flow velocities were also investigated in the study january 2004 measurements revealed 40 cm s inner flow velocity at the entrance of the golden horn and the motion continues towards the broadest part the region between kasımpaşa and cibali however in march 2004 measurements of the golden horn showed a decrease in inner flow velocity rates and were found to be 20 cm s these measurements suggested that the water flows into the golden horn depends on season outside velocity measurements for september 2004 are missing in this study according to müftüoğlu 2008 the valide sultan bridge which is a floating type bridge has tremendously antagonistic effects on the horizontal flow and circulation patterns of the golden horn according to the environmental engineering and consultancy company mne field research discharges of kağıthane and alibeyköy streams at the entrance of the golden horn on june 6 2012 which were 0 9 m3 s and 0 7 m3 s respectively which conform to the previously recorded base flow measurements of summertime while there were no specified maximum minimum discharges in the research the mean annual discharges were found to be 2 7 m3 s and 1 77 m3 s respectively mne çevre 2013 in addition to kağıthane and alibeyköy streams construction of the can suyu project which aims to generate water body circulation via continuously feeding the golden horn with the water of the bosphorus started at 2009 and finished at 2014 according to istanbul water and sewerage adminstration 2015 the amount of pumped water was 3 m3 s which helped to increase water quality and water body circulation of the golden horn iski 2015 according to erdik et al 2019a the golden horn environment protection project includes can suyu project targets to convey the black sea water into the golden horn in a range between 3 and 6 m3 s despite the many research studies on the golden horn there still remain many areas that still need to be examined despite highlighting the current condition of the golden horn an experimental research approach is necessary to understand many of the contingencies that remain to the best of our knowledge the physical experimental model of the golden horn has never been performed to investigate the horizontal and circulation flow patterns therefore an attempt has been made to close this gap by performing physical model experiments to determine the structural effects on the hydrodynamics of the golden horn i e the horizontal water and circulation flow patterns in addition flow patterns associated with the estuary bathymetry characteristics are examined experiments for the physical model are performed under four scenarios namely without structure scenario 1 with atatürk unkapanı bridge scenario 2 with a submerged bridge scenario 3 and atatürk unkapanı bridge and a submerged bridge presence considered together scenario 4 the atatürk bridge scenario 2 exhibits the present day situation of the golden horn many studies of the golden horn show that the surface layer is most polluted investigating horizontal flow patterns can help increase the quality of the golden horn water body which may positively affect the biodiversity commercial transport human activity and fish and other aquatic species in the region therefore the objectives of the present study are 1 to perform physical model experiments to evaluate the bathymetry and structure effects on the hydrodynamics of the golden horn 2 to specifically investigate the horizontal water and circulation flow patterns in the golden horn under different structures and bathymetry effects via physical experimental modeling 2 hydrodynamics of bosphorus and its interaction with the golden horn the golden horn estuary is a historic inlet linked to the bosphorus strait the golden horn has precious biodiversity and provides a habitat for a wide variety of living creatures yüksek et al 2006 reported that a diverse biological community exists in this estuary according to chawla et al 2008 the water circulation of the estuary is governed by three mechanisms which are river discharge tides and coastal winds in the golden horn estuary these forces are insufficient to generate circulation and enhance clean water flow tidal currents are insufficient in providing any mixing in the estuary according to alpar et al 2005 tidal effects are rather small 3 54 cm mean spring range and 1 38 cm mean neap range and mainly semi diurnal with form factor 1 24 the stress induced by the blowing wind over golden horn mostly 2 m s is insufficient to generate water circulation and the amount of water discharged from alibeyköy and kağıthane districts into the golden horn is fairly limited erdik et al 2019b developed a numerical model to simulate the water circulation of the golden horn they found that the monthly average inflow rate into the golden horn from bosphorus strait through and monthly average outflow rate from the estuary to the bosphorus strait are approximately 250 m3 s the flow patterns of the bosphorus strait indicate a stratified two layer flow structure where the black sea upper layer which is governed by barotropic forces flows towards the marmara sea the lower layer flow of the marmara sea is governed by baroclinic pressure gradients which move in the opposite direction towards the black sea özsoy et al 1996 1998 jarosz et al 2011 beji and erdik 2018 erdik et al 2018 sacu et al 2020 the sum of the riverine flows and precipitation into the black sea is much greater than the water loss due to evaporation accordingly the black sea water level is in general higher than that of the marmara sea which in turn induces upper flow towards the sea of marmara on the other hand the reverse lower layer baroclinic flow from sea of marmara to the black sea towards the north is generated essentially by salinity difference which are 38 ppt and 33 ppt in the lower layers of southern and northern ends of bosphorus respectively water exchange via the bosphorus is the main factor that generates the circulation in the golden horn 3 materials and methods experiments performed in the istanbul technical university hydraulic and water resources laboratory utilized froude number scaling as a basis for the model similitude for both horizontal and vertical dimensions a linear 1 80 geometric scale model was constructed using bathymetry data provided by istanbul metropolitan municipality a model of the golden horn was built with precisely 1 80 scale covering küçük mustafa paşa at northwest and galata bridge at southeast the length of the model is 21 meters m where the narrowest part is 5 m and the widest part is 9 9 m the experiments are performed under four different scenarios and each scenario is investigated under three different flow rates which are 0 83 1 11 and 1 39 l per second liter s flow rate accuracy and consistency ensured by an ultrasonic flowmeter of bass instruments the main objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of different structures on the horizontal flow patterns of the golden horn the discharge rates were set by the operational flow conditions 3 1 development of the physical model of the golden horn one of the most prominent and critical duties of the present study was to ensure the accuracy of the model and its findings designing building and constructing the experimental bathymetric model with its bridge structures used sophisticated instruments and analyses methods the accurate representation of the physical field was an essential step in developing the bathymetric model an appropriate scale was vital to obtain widely relevant experimental results the length scale ratio lr 1 80 presented the appropriate layout for representing the field as well as the applicability of the model in the laboratory before the construction process bathymetry data provided by istanbul metropolitan municipality was preprocessed for practical application topographic instruments total station and leveling combined with topographic methods were utilized to ensure reproducing precision the primary materials were wooden piles and logs also ground fillings to perform the exploratory study after model borders and the coordinates of wooden piles were determined and fixed to their corresponding points a leveling instrument and further controls of wooden pile elevation were used to represent the field subsequently laths were connected with the wooden piles and filled with sand to form a smooth surface afterward the surface was coated with concrete finalizing the construction process all of the operations were precisely implemented according to the provided bathymetry map water discharge into the model was provided from a roof tank with a volume of 30 m3 which was continuously fed by laboratory pumps so that the water level was kept constant at all times water navigated through pipes under the gravitational force and to mimic flows into the golden horn model at the end of the hose an 8 cm diameter and 3 8 m long pipe with 13 discharge holes are used to form a homogeneous steady state flow also an iron navigator was placed to drive the flow through the structures 3 2 velocity measurements and data post processing for accurate determination of the hydrodynamic characteristics all measurement points and grid cells were selected so that a mesh grid with 1 m 1 m interval formed the grid cells were located 4 5 m away from the upstream in the grid the distance from a point to neighboring points was 1 m 1 m measurements were obtained from 50 different points which were placed for the construction of a flow velocity vector field to generate an adequate mesh system additionally a spray dye was used for marking each point the same measurement points were used in every scenario to provide consistency the overall experimental model of the golden horn is depicted in fig 1 sontek micro adv and nortek vectrino ii devices are the two acoustic doppler velocimeters used for the experiments both adv s are located 10 cm under the surface and fixed on metal tripods with limnographs to stipulate measurement consistency and to collect accurate data the devices were set to 50 hz sampling rate which is the highest sampling rate capability of sontek micro adv and positioned 6 m apart from each other to prevent any possible signal interference between the measurement in different spots of the advs a minimum of 10 min intervals was used between measurements in different locations so that any remaining kinetic energy in the model basin decayed to zero the first post processing step was to refine the accumulated velocity data with the despiking method of goring nikora 2002 despiked data sets are prepared as time averaged velocities and indicated on the drawing of the model to avoid performing extra interpolation of the unmeasured territory visual maps that contained velocity vectors inside the measured area of the physical model were used the minimum curvature method was used in the mapping as briggs 1974 depicts vector calculations were restricted within the border of velocity measurement data 3 3 performing model experiments under four scenarios scenario 1 the first scenario which is considered as a reference model natural condition is without a bridge structure structureless model installed in the experimental area this structureless scenario is considered for the evaluation of the hydrodynamics of the golden horn in the absence of any structural perturbation the structureless model is shown in fig 2 scenario 2 the second scenario aims to investigate the hydrodynamics of the golden horn in the presence of atatürk bridge this scenario corresponded to the current situation and was used to explore the present hydrodynamic condition of the golden horn styrofoam and plexiglass materials are used in modeling of the ataturk bridge one styrofoam is 31 cm long 11 5 cm wide and 7 cm height plexiglasses are placed above and under the styrofoam to construct a pontoon model and subsequently all pontoons are combined with long plexiglass to ensure that all pontoons are stationary during the experiments the purpose of this scenario was to evaluate the ataturk bridge effects on the hydrodynamics of the golden horn similar to the present real bridge there exist 24 pontoons the atatürk bridge model scenario 2 is shown in fig 3 scenario 3 for the third scenario the already constructed submerged bridge which is 44 cm wide 10 cm long and 26 cm height was used its pile and plexiglass bridge heights are 12 5 cm and 13 5 cm respectively the submerged bridge was positioned 9 m away from the upstream between unkapanı and kasımpaşa districts northeast to southwest the bridge height was measured 26 cm bridge from the bottom and extends up to 15 cm beneath the water surface the objective of this scenario was to observe the submerged bridge effects on the hydrodynamics of the golden horn fig 4 illustrates the submerged bridge scenario 4 for this scenario submerged and ataturk bridges are installed together in the experimental model in the same locations as in scenario 2 and scenario 3 respectively ataturk bridge and submerged bridge models are located close to each other at the fatih side and diverge from each other on the beyoğlu side 4 results and discussion physical experiments are performed for four scenarios and flow rates of 0 83 1 11 and 1 39 l per second liter s to evaluate the effects of the described structures on the hydrodynamics of the golden horn for the physical experiments the bathymetry bridges and generated measurement points grid cells of the experimental model are indicated in fig 5 a group of consecutive measurement points are aligned north to south and consist of 2 6 measurement points these sets are numbered as the first set second set etc from upstream to downstream in addition plus signs indicate the measurement points and for the sake of graphical clarity only some of the sets are represented with dashed lines as shown in fig 5 4 1 first scenario evaluating the effects of the structures on the flow patterns of the golden horn the structureless scenario scenario 1 is considered as a reference model in this scenario even though the increasing flow rate gives rise to a stronger upstream to downstream flow the backflow of water does not change for this study backflow is defined as the flow direction from downstream to upstream as shown in fig 6 for 0 83 l s flow rate the flow goes downstream at the fatih side and turns mostly backward at beyoğlu side between third and fourth sets the flow starts to join the backward flow and downstream through the exit at the sixth set the flow separates according to its flow pattern direction in the first and second regions in the first region the flow moves towards the northside and tends to turn back to the upstream side in the second region an eddy is observed between the flow coming from downstream and the sets of the second region for 1 11 l s flow rate as shown in fig 7 from first to the fifth set a prominent eddy is formed which dominates the middle part of the golden horn similarly for 0 83 l s flow rate near the sixth set flow alters its way sharply to the southside of the current accordingly the flow velocities at the southside points increase the entire points of the first set separate from the flow trying to turn back to upstream for 1 39 l s discharge flows coming from other sets in the first region join the north point of the fourth set as depicted in fig 8 in this value of flow rate disordered current starts to move towards downstream from the middle of the golden horn similar to the previous cases the tendency of the flow is to move south as it advances to the downstream between the first and the second region a swirling flow pattern is also observed 4 2 second scenario in this scenario atatürk bridge is installed into the model to investigate the related alterations in the hydrodynamics of the golden horn for 0 83 l s discharge value the formation of several eddies and collisions can easily be observed as illustrated in fig 9 similar to the structureless scenario the flow turns backward on the beyoğlu side between fourth and fifth sets almost no positive x velocity forms in the first region a large eddy is observed along with the joining of the flows coming from all sets of the entire first region in the second region flows coming from fifth and sixth sets emerge with that of the ninth set preventing the formation of eddies 0 83 l s and 1 11 l s flow rates generated flow patterns similar to those that occurred in 0 83 l s discharge case in the proximity of the atatürk bridge the interaction of velocity vectors with opposite directions is observed at the points of sixth to tenth sets flow moves downstream with the joining of flows from the sets of the second region in the first region a similar eddy to that in the 0 83 l s case is also formed even a small eddy is observed in the middle of the second region where circulation flow patterns join and mainly heads downstream the mentioned patterns are indicated in fig 10 fig 11 shows the velocity vectors for the 1 39 l s flow rate as can be seen from this figure a dominant circular flow pattern occurs in the first region from the first to fifth sets a quarter circular flow pattern forms in the north points and subsequently generated currents join to the northside negative flow beyond the fifth set flows of all the sets join towards the southside at the eighth set in the first region an eddy similar to that of 0 83 l s and 1 11 l s cases forms however the flow interaction between the first and second regions is less than those that take place for the other flow rate values in the second region the flows emerge at the eighth set and join to overall southside flow 4 3 third scenario this scenario is the case where the submerged bridge solely exits in the golden horn as may be seen from fig 12 for the 0 83 l s flow rate currents directed up to upstream and a small eddy on the downstream side is observed figs 13 and 14 illustrate however dominant horizontal downstream flows are evident for 1 11 l s and 1 39 l s for 0 83 l s flow rate due to the circulation at the end of the model the flow coming from downstream turns back at the northside and starts to join to the positive flow between the fifth and sixth set as it separates the first region from the second region and forms a circulatory flow within its region the upstream to downstream flow is easily observed for 1 11 l s discharge as fig 13 shows besides a small eddy formed between the sixth and the fifth sets the backflow comes from the third point of the sixth set and fourth point of the seventh set and joins the eddy at the fifth point of the fifth set when the flow rate is 1 39 l s as fig 14 illustrates the flow velocities are very close to that of the 1 11 l s case however there is a strong backflow that forms at the southside of the sixth set moving towards the south points of the fifth set surprisingly despite the fact that 1 39 l s is not significantly larger than 1 11 l s between the seventh and the ninth sets an interaction of flow was observed as a result in terms of direct upstream to downstream flow this scenario shows that the submerged bridge is the best hydrodynamic condition option 4 4 fourth scenario this scenario shows the hydrodynamic flow characteristics for the double bridge case when the flow rate is 0 83 l s similar to the submerged bridge scenario no northside backflow forms fig 15 the flow coming south to the first set from the northside of the fifth set unites with the existing flow at the first set and joins the northside flow eddies are also observed in the first and second regions the eddy of the first region takes the form of the shape of the letter s the eddy of the second region starts at the sixth set and turns backward at the eighth set with part of it joining the eddy of the first region besides in this scenario only 0 83 l s flow rate value generated currents at the thirteenth set s points which tend to flow directly towards the downstream for 1 11 l s flow rate fig 16 illustrates the northside backflow similar to that of the structureless and atatürk bridge scenarios before the submerged bridge the flow tends to join with northside backflow where after the submerged bridge moves downstream in the middle area of the model the backflow coming from the downstream at the thirteenth set commences moving downstream at the eleventh set additionally the flow separates into first and second regions and joins the generated whirling currents of the almost all sets of the second region in the first region similarly an s shaped eddy was observed in 1 39 l s flow rate case fig 17 shows that the currents of the second region tend to flow perpendicular to the north shore and joining back to the main downstream flow at the first four sets and advances through the southside flow in addition backflows at sixth seventh and eighth sets are apparent the separation of the flow between the first and the second region can be recognized clearly fig 17 delineates the first and second region flow patterns in the first region the currents flow towards the south in the downstream direction then move towards the northside and turn backward with forming an eddy in the second region flow coming from sixth set whirls back from the tenth set in summary velocity measurement data is gathered and velocity field maps are plotted accordingly similar to some of the studies that demonstrated the effects of the floating bridges are inimical to the water circulation in this study it has been found that the atatürk bridge scenario with its pontoons present situation has the worst structure effect on the golden horn horizontal flow patterns moreover it is well known that atatürk bridge is an indispensable factor that directly affects the water circulation of the golden horn as can be seen from the vector maps the estuary currents tend to flow near coastal sides interaction of opposite velocity field vectors is also observed around the atatürk bridge further small and large eddies formed and related collisions are noticed in this scenario on the other hand the submerged bridge scenario provided the best hydrodynamic flow conditions in terms of its effects on the horizontal flow field of the estuary however transportation is also a significant reality for daily life and since public transportation of a large and growing city like istanbul has to be considered in detail the submerged bridge scenario least influences the golden horn hydrodynamics is recommended as regards the double bridge scenario the separation of the flow between the first and the second regions could be clearly recognized eddy formations are also noticed in the first and second regions the eddy in the first region is observed to be s shaped the constructed vector map further delineates the first and second region flow patterns 5 conclusion in order to achieve the objective of the present study a physical experimental model of the golden horn was constructed according to four distinct scenarios all scenarios are implemented for three different flow rates to investigate the horizontal flow patterns of the golden horn 1 the experiments comprise twelve cases that have different consequences on the downstream and upstream flow patterns eddies the northside and southside flows and flows separation into two regions depending on the flow characteristics 2 to understand the structural effects the results of the structureless scenario are vitally important in this scenario for all flow rates the flow separates into two regions which are named as first and second regions additionally backward flow is observed at 0 83 l s flow rate and an eddy emerged in the middle of the golden horn region for 1 39 l s flow rate 3 only the atatürk bridge scenario indicates the current situation of the golden horn in this scenario strong backward flows coming from the northside are observed for 0 83 l s discharge value the flow separated into two regions with possessing different characteristics dead zones with almost 0 m s velocity also formed in this flow rate value similar flow patterns are observed for the 1 11 l s and 1 39 l s flow rates however when the flow rate was 1 39 l s the border between the two regions was sharper than those seen for other flow rate values 4 the submerged bridge scenario is a fictional scenario for future considerations the strongest upstream to downstream flow is observed in this scenario for 0 83 l s flow rate excessive water volume generates a feeble reverse backflow circulation with the formation of eddies in 1 11 l s case flows commence to emerge towards downstream small eddies are also present in the existing flow the features of the 1 39 l s flow rate are very similar to those of the 1 11 l s with the existing backflows 5 the double bridge scenario is also a fictional scenario with the combination of both submerged and atatürk bridge for 0 83 l s two regions form in the model according to the flow properties s shaped eddies are also observed for 1 11 l s s shaped eddies occur at the joining of all middle part points as regards the 1 39 l s flow rate once again two regions of flow formed 6 the experimental model results of this study indicate that the flow patterns vary significantly for different structural and flow rate conditions 6 future work in the present study the physical experimental models are developed to determine the horizontal water flow patterns in the golden horn under different bridge structures the wind also has an effect on the bosphorus strait it affects two layer flow etc and was not considered in the developed model however it is recommended that for a more comprehensive investigation of the hydrodynamics of the golden horn integration of these effects should be considered if suitable conditions exist also stream velocity can be measured at different depths and three dimensional 3d velocity profiles may be constructed to perform a detailed analysis in order to obtain information about base flows despite the simplified model used in this study velocity measurements approximately follow the field measurements present in the literature this implies that the essential features of the physical processes involved are well captured by

of the estuary to be extremely high pollution was so extreme that the air around its shores became unbreathable at times many studies focused on the pollution of the golden horn the first comprehensive study was a ph d dissertation by kor 1963 who analyzed the pollution and oxygenation concentration the sediment layer and their effects özsoy et al 1988 addressed that the surface layer of the golden horn carries such dense suspended sediment particles so that sunrays are mostly absorbed the study of ergin et al 1991 concentrated on suspended heavy metal sediments at the top of the water layer of the golden horn and izmit bay in contrast to izmit bay golden horn is found to be more densely contaminated with metal pollution the study focused on the reasons for the extreme heavy metal pollution and their influence on the discharging streams of the golden horn another study by sur et al 2002 investigated the oceanographic properties of the golden horn and the golden horn rehabilitation project they highlighted the detrimental effects of the old floating bridge the valide sultan bridge müftüoğlu 2002 comprehensively analyzed the golden horn in terms of physical oceanography the monthly datasets of velocity salinity and temperature were assessed to provide a better understanding of the oceanographic properties of the golden horn at the entrance bosphorus side of the golden horn galata bridge the top layer salinity was observed as 18 20 practical salinity unit psu due to the winds at the depth while at the bottom layer 15 and 25 m the salinity was 38 psu in past years the daily discharge of alibeyköy and kağıthane streams has decreased and due to the reduced discharge features of the upper layer of the golden horn have become similar to the black sea water characteristics the inflow into the golden horn and outflow throughout the bosphorus discharges of the golden horn were calculated as 494 59 m3 s and 417 75 m3 s respectively muftuoglu 2002 resulting in a 15 5 difference between inflow and outflow which is considered to be an acceptable range altunkaynak et al 2005 conducted another study to highlight the changes in the amount of oxygen present in the golden horn water body via a logical model they listed the pollution level of the golden horn and developed a fuzzy logic model for the prediction of monthly dissolved oxygen do müftüoğlu 2008 described the layered flow of the golden horn and estimated the opposite directional flows also he explained that inside and outside flows observed at the eminönü and karaköy shores vary with seasons and temperatures and that the salinity of the golden horn has not changed in years 38 psu at the bottom layer and 18 20 psu at the surface layer at the golden horn entrance additionally although the surface layer temperature is susceptible to the weather conditions it is highlighted that the bottom layer temperature remains at 15 c during the year the flow velocities were also investigated in the study january 2004 measurements revealed 40 cm s inner flow velocity at the entrance of the golden horn and the motion continues towards the broadest part the region between kasımpaşa and cibali however in march 2004 measurements of the golden horn showed a decrease in inner flow velocity rates and were found to be 20 cm s these measurements suggested that the water flows into the golden horn depends on season outside velocity measurements for september 2004 are missing in this study according to müftüoğlu 2008 the valide sultan bridge which is a floating type bridge has tremendously antagonistic effects on the horizontal flow and circulation patterns of the golden horn according to the environmental engineering and consultancy company mne field research discharges of kağıthane and alibeyköy streams at the entrance of the golden horn on june 6 2012 which were 0 9 m3 s and 0 7 m3 s respectively which conform to the previously recorded base flow measurements of summertime while there were no specified maximum minimum discharges in the research the mean annual discharges were found to be 2 7 m3 s and 1 77 m3 s respectively mne çevre 2013 in addition to kağıthane and alibeyköy streams construction of the can suyu project which aims to generate water body circulation via continuously feeding the golden horn with the water of the bosphorus started at 2009 and finished at 2014 according to istanbul water and sewerage adminstration 2015 the amount of pumped water was 3 m3 s which helped to increase water quality and water body circulation of the golden horn iski 2015 according to erdik et al 2019a the golden horn environment protection project includes can suyu project targets to convey the black sea water into the golden horn in a range between 3 and 6 m3 s despite the many research studies on the golden horn there still remain many areas that still need to be examined despite highlighting the current condition of the golden horn an experimental research approach is necessary to understand many of the contingencies that remain to the best of our knowledge the physical experimental model of the golden horn has never been performed to investigate the horizontal and circulation flow patterns therefore an attempt has been made to close this gap by performing physical model experiments to determine the structural effects on the hydrodynamics of the golden horn i e the horizontal water and circulation flow patterns in addition flow patterns associated with the estuary bathymetry characteristics are examined experiments for the physical model are performed under four scenarios namely without structure scenario 1 with atatürk unkapanı bridge scenario 2 with a submerged bridge scenario 3 and atatürk unkapanı bridge and a submerged bridge presence considered together scenario 4 the atatürk bridge scenario 2 exhibits the present day situation of the golden horn many studies of the golden horn show that the surface layer is most polluted investigating horizontal flow patterns can help increase the quality of the golden horn water body which may positively affect the biodiversity commercial transport human activity and fish and other aquatic species in the region therefore the objectives of the present study are 1 to perform physical model experiments to evaluate the bathymetry and structure effects on the hydrodynamics of the golden horn 2 to specifically investigate the horizontal water and circulation flow patterns in the golden horn under different structures and bathymetry effects via physical experimental modeling 2 hydrodynamics of bosphorus and its interaction with the golden horn the golden horn estuary is a historic inlet linked to the bosphorus strait the golden horn has precious biodiversity and provides a habitat for a wide variety of living creatures yüksek et al 2006 reported that a diverse biological community exists in this estuary according to chawla et al 2008 the water circulation of the estuary is governed by three mechanisms which are river discharge tides and coastal winds in the golden horn estuary these forces are insufficient to generate circulation and enhance clean water flow tidal currents are insufficient in providing any mixing in the estuary according to alpar et al 2005 tidal effects are rather small 3 54 cm mean spring range and 1 38 cm mean neap range and mainly semi diurnal with form factor 1 24 the stress induced by the blowing wind over golden horn mostly 2 m s is insufficient to generate water circulation and the amount of water discharged from alibeyköy and kağıthane districts into the golden horn is fairly limited erdik et al 2019b developed a numerical model to simulate the water circulation of the golden horn they found that the monthly average inflow rate into the golden horn from bosphorus strait through and monthly average outflow rate from the estuary to the bosphorus strait are approximately 250 m3 s the flow patterns of the bosphorus strait indicate a stratified two layer flow structure where the black sea upper layer which is governed by barotropic forces flows towards the marmara sea the lower layer flow of the marmara sea is governed by baroclinic pressure gradients which move in the opposite direction towards the black sea özsoy et al 1996 1998 jarosz et al 2011 beji and erdik 2018 erdik et al 2018 sacu et al 2020 the sum of the riverine flows and precipitation into the black sea is much greater than the water loss due to evaporation accordingly the black sea water level is in general higher than that of the marmara sea which in turn induces upper flow towards the sea of marmara on the other hand the reverse lower layer baroclinic flow from sea of marmara to the black sea towards the north is generated essentially by salinity difference which are 38 ppt and 33 ppt in the lower layers of southern and northern ends of bosphorus respectively water exchange via the bosphorus is the main factor that generates the circulation in the golden horn 3 materials and methods experiments performed in the istanbul technical university hydraulic and water resources laboratory utilized froude number scaling as a basis for the model similitude for both horizontal and vertical dimensions a linear 1 80 geometric scale model was constructed using bathymetry data provided by istanbul metropolitan municipality a model of the golden horn was built with precisely 1 80 scale covering küçük mustafa paşa at northwest and galata bridge at southeast the length of the model is 21 meters m where the narrowest part is 5 m and the widest part is 9 9 m the experiments are performed under four different scenarios and each scenario is investigated under three different flow rates which are 0 83 1 11 and 1 39 l per second liter s flow rate accuracy and consistency ensured by an ultrasonic flowmeter of bass instruments the main objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of different structures on the horizontal flow patterns of the golden horn the discharge rates were set by the operational flow conditions 3 1 development of the physical model of the golden horn one of the most prominent and critical duties of the present study was to ensure the accuracy of the model and its findings designing building and constructing the experimental bathymetric model with its bridge structures used sophisticated instruments and analyses methods the accurate representation of the physical field was an essential step in developing the bathymetric model an appropriate scale was vital to obtain widely relevant experimental results the length scale ratio lr 1 80 presented the appropriate layout for representing the field as well as the applicability of the model in the laboratory before the construction process bathymetry data provided by istanbul metropolitan municipality was preprocessed for practical application topographic instruments total station and leveling combined with topographic methods were utilized to ensure reproducing precision the primary materials were wooden piles and logs also ground fillings to perform the exploratory study after model borders and the coordinates of wooden piles were determined and fixed to their corresponding points a leveling instrument and further controls of wooden pile elevation were used to represent the field subsequently laths were connected with the wooden piles and filled with sand to form a smooth surface afterward the surface was coated with concrete finalizing the construction process all of the operations were precisely implemented according to the provided bathymetry map water discharge into the model was provided from a roof tank with a volume of 30 m3 which was continuously fed by laboratory pumps so that the water level was kept constant at all times water navigated through pipes under the gravitational force and to mimic flows into the golden horn model at the end of the hose an 8 cm diameter and 3 8 m long pipe with 13 discharge holes are used to form a homogeneous steady state flow also an iron navigator was placed to drive the flow through the structures 3 2 velocity measurements and data post processing for accurate determination of the hydrodynamic characteristics all measurement points and grid cells were selected so that a mesh grid with 1 m 1 m interval formed the grid cells were located 4 5 m away from the upstream in the grid the distance from a point to neighboring points was 1 m 1 m measurements were obtained from 50 different points which were placed for the construction of a flow velocity vector field to generate an adequate mesh system additionally a spray dye was used for marking each point the same measurement points were used in every scenario to provide consistency the overall experimental model of the golden horn is depicted in fig 1 sontek micro adv and nortek vectrino ii devices are the two acoustic doppler velocimeters used for the experiments both adv s are located 10 cm under the surface and fixed on metal tripods with limnographs to stipulate measurement consistency and to collect accurate data the devices were set to 50 hz sampling rate which is the highest sampling rate capability of sontek micro adv and positioned 6 m apart from each other to prevent any possible signal interference between the measurement in different spots of the advs a minimum of 10 min intervals was used between measurements in different locations so that any remaining kinetic energy in the model basin decayed to zero the first post processing step was to refine the accumulated velocity data with the despiking method of goring nikora 2002 despiked data sets are prepared as time averaged velocities and indicated on the drawing of the model to avoid performing extra interpolation of the unmeasured territory visual maps that contained velocity vectors inside the measured area of the physical model were used the minimum curvature method was used in the mapping as briggs 1974 depicts vector calculations were restricted within the border of velocity measurement data 3 3 performing model experiments under four scenarios scenario 1 the first scenario which is considered as a reference model natural condition is without a bridge structure structureless model installed in the experimental area this structureless scenario is considered for the evaluation of the hydrodynamics of the golden horn in the absence of any structural perturbation the structureless model is shown in fig 2 scenario 2 the second scenario aims to investigate the hydrodynamics of the golden horn in the presence of atatürk bridge this scenario corresponded to the current situation and was used to explore the present hydrodynamic condition of the golden horn styrofoam and plexiglass materials are used in modeling of the ataturk bridge one styrofoam is 31 cm long 11 5 cm wide and 7 cm height plexiglasses are placed above and under the styrofoam to construct a pontoon model and subsequently all pontoons are combined with long plexiglass to ensure that all pontoons are stationary during the experiments the purpose of this scenario was to evaluate the ataturk bridge effects on the hydrodynamics of the golden horn similar to the present real bridge there exist 24 pontoons the atatürk bridge model scenario 2 is shown in fig 3 scenario 3 for the third scenario the already constructed submerged bridge which is 44 cm wide 10 cm long and 26 cm height was used its pile and plexiglass bridge heights are 12 5 cm and 13 5 cm respectively the submerged bridge was positioned 9 m away from the upstream between unkapanı and kasımpaşa districts northeast to southwest the bridge height was measured 26 cm bridge from the bottom and extends up to 15 cm beneath the water surface the objective of this scenario was to observe the submerged bridge effects on the hydrodynamics of the golden horn fig 4 illustrates the submerged bridge scenario 4 for this scenario submerged and ataturk bridges are installed together in the experimental model in the same locations as in scenario 2 and scenario 3 respectively ataturk bridge and submerged bridge models are located close to each other at the fatih side and diverge from each other on the beyoğlu side 4 results and discussion physical experiments are performed for four scenarios and flow rates of 0 83 1 11 and 1 39 l per second liter s to evaluate the effects of the described structures on the hydrodynamics of the golden horn for the physical experiments the bathymetry bridges and generated measurement points grid cells of the experimental model are indicated in fig 5 a group of consecutive measurement points are aligned north to south and consist of 2 6 measurement points these sets are numbered as the first set second set etc from upstream to downstream in addition plus signs indicate the measurement points and for the sake of graphical clarity only some of the sets are represented with dashed lines as shown in fig 5 4 1 first scenario evaluating the effects of the structures on the flow patterns of the golden horn the structureless scenario scenario 1 is considered as a reference model in this scenario even though the increasing flow rate gives rise to a stronger upstream to downstream flow the backflow of water does not change for this study backflow is defined as the flow direction from downstream to upstream as shown in fig 6 for 0 83 l s flow rate the flow goes downstream at the fatih side and turns mostly backward at beyoğlu side between third and fourth sets the flow starts to join the backward flow and downstream through the exit at the sixth set the flow separates according to its flow pattern direction in the first and second regions in the first region the flow moves towards the northside and tends to turn back to the upstream side in the second region an eddy is observed between the flow coming from downstream and the sets of the second region for 1 11 l s flow rate as shown in fig 7 from first to the fifth set a prominent eddy is formed which dominates the middle part of the golden horn similarly for 0 83 l s flow rate near the sixth set flow alters its way sharply to the southside of the current accordingly the flow velocities at the southside points increase the entire points of the first set separate from the flow trying to turn back to upstream for 1 39 l s discharge flows coming from other sets in the first region join the north point of the fourth set as depicted in fig 8 in this value of flow rate disordered current starts to move towards downstream from the middle of the golden horn similar to the previous cases the tendency of the flow is to move south as it advances to the downstream between the first and the second region a swirling flow pattern is also observed 4 2 second scenario in this scenario atatürk bridge is installed into the model to investigate the related alterations in the hydrodynamics of the golden horn for 0 83 l s discharge value the formation of several eddies and collisions can easily be observed as illustrated in fig 9 similar to the structureless scenario the flow turns backward on the beyoğlu side between fourth and fifth sets almost no positive x velocity forms in the first region a large eddy is observed along with the joining of the flows coming from all sets of the entire first region in the second region flows coming from fifth and sixth sets emerge with that of the ninth set preventing the formation of eddies 0 83 l s and 1 11 l s flow rates generated flow patterns similar to those that occurred in 0 83 l s discharge case in the proximity of the atatürk bridge the interaction of velocity vectors with opposite directions is observed at the points of sixth to tenth sets flow moves downstream with the joining of flows from the sets of the second region in the first region a similar eddy to that in the 0 83 l s case is also formed even a small eddy is observed in the middle of the second region where circulation flow patterns join and mainly heads downstream the mentioned patterns are indicated in fig 10 fig 11 shows the velocity vectors for the 1 39 l s flow rate as can be seen from this figure a dominant circular flow pattern occurs in the first region from the first to fifth sets a quarter circular flow pattern forms in the north points and subsequently generated currents join to the northside negative flow beyond the fifth set flows of all the sets join towards the southside at the eighth set in the first region an eddy similar to that of 0 83 l s and 1 11 l s cases forms however the flow interaction between the first and second regions is less than those that take place for the other flow rate values in the second region the flows emerge at the eighth set and join to overall southside flow 4 3 third scenario this scenario is the case where the submerged bridge solely exits in the golden horn as may be seen from fig 12 for the 0 83 l s flow rate currents directed up to upstream and a small eddy on the downstream side is observed figs 13 and 14 illustrate however dominant horizontal downstream flows are evident for 1 11 l s and 1 39 l s for 0 83 l s flow rate due to the circulation at the end of the model the flow coming from downstream turns back at the northside and starts to join to the positive flow between the fifth and sixth set as it separates the first region from the second region and forms a circulatory flow within its region the upstream to downstream flow is easily observed for 1 11 l s discharge as fig 13 shows besides a small eddy formed between the sixth and the fifth sets the backflow comes from the third point of the sixth set and fourth point of the seventh set and joins the eddy at the fifth point of the fifth set when the flow rate is 1 39 l s as fig 14 illustrates the flow velocities are very close to that of the 1 11 l s case however there is a strong backflow that forms at the southside of the sixth set moving towards the south points of the fifth set surprisingly despite the fact that 1 39 l s is not significantly larger than 1 11 l s between the seventh and the ninth sets an interaction of flow was observed as a result in terms of direct upstream to downstream flow this scenario shows that the submerged bridge is the best hydrodynamic condition option 4 4 fourth scenario this scenario shows the hydrodynamic flow characteristics for the double bridge case when the flow rate is 0 83 l s similar to the submerged bridge scenario no northside backflow forms fig 15 the flow coming south to the first set from the northside of the fifth set unites with the existing flow at the first set and joins the northside flow eddies are also observed in the first and second regions the eddy of the first region takes the form of the shape of the letter s the eddy of the second region starts at the sixth set and turns backward at the eighth set with part of it joining the eddy of the first region besides in this scenario only 0 83 l s flow rate value generated currents at the thirteenth set s points which tend to flow directly towards the downstream for 1 11 l s flow rate fig 16 illustrates the northside backflow similar to that of the structureless and atatürk bridge scenarios before the submerged bridge the flow tends to join with northside backflow where after the submerged bridge moves downstream in the middle area of the model the backflow coming from the downstream at the thirteenth set commences moving downstream at the eleventh set additionally the flow separates into first and second regions and joins the generated whirling currents of the almost all sets of the second region in the first region similarly an s shaped eddy was observed in 1 39 l s flow rate case fig 17 shows that the currents of the second region tend to flow perpendicular to the north shore and joining back to the main downstream flow at the first four sets and advances through the southside flow in addition backflows at sixth seventh and eighth sets are apparent the separation of the flow between the first and the second region can be recognized clearly fig 17 delineates the first and second region flow patterns in the first region the currents flow towards the south in the downstream direction then move towards the northside and turn backward with forming an eddy in the second region flow coming from sixth set whirls back from the tenth set in summary velocity measurement data is gathered and velocity field maps are plotted accordingly similar to some of the studies that demonstrated the effects of the floating bridges are inimical to the water circulation in this study it has been found that the atatürk bridge scenario with its pontoons present situation has the worst structure effect on the golden horn horizontal flow patterns moreover it is well known that atatürk bridge is an indispensable factor that directly affects the water circulation of the golden horn as can be seen from the vector maps the estuary currents tend to flow near coastal sides interaction of opposite velocity field vectors is also observed around the atatürk bridge further small and large eddies formed and related collisions are noticed in this scenario on the other hand the submerged bridge scenario provided the best hydrodynamic flow conditions in terms of its effects on the horizontal flow field of the estuary however transportation is also a significant reality for daily life and since public transportation of a large and growing city like istanbul has to be considered in detail the submerged bridge scenario least influences the golden horn hydrodynamics is recommended as regards the double bridge scenario the separation of the flow between the first and the second regions could be clearly recognized eddy formations are also noticed in the first and second regions the eddy in the first region is observed to be s shaped the constructed vector map further delineates the first and second region flow patterns 5 conclusion in order to achieve the objective of the present study a physical experimental model of the golden horn was constructed according to four distinct scenarios all scenarios are implemented for three different flow rates to investigate the horizontal flow patterns of the golden horn 1 the experiments comprise twelve cases that have different consequences on the downstream and upstream flow patterns eddies the northside and southside flows and flows separation into two regions depending on the flow characteristics 2 to understand the structural effects the results of the structureless scenario are vitally important in this scenario for all flow rates the flow separates into two regions which are named as first and second regions additionally backward flow is observed at 0 83 l s flow rate and an eddy emerged in the middle of the golden horn region for 1 39 l s flow rate 3 only the atatürk bridge scenario indicates the current situation of the golden horn in this scenario strong backward flows coming from the northside are observed for 0 83 l s discharge value the flow separated into two regions with possessing different characteristics dead zones with almost 0 m s velocity also formed in this flow rate value similar flow patterns are observed for the 1 11 l s and 1 39 l s flow rates however when the flow rate was 1 39 l s the border between the two regions was sharper than those seen for other flow rate values 4 the submerged bridge scenario is a fictional scenario for future considerations the strongest upstream to downstream flow is observed in this scenario for 0 83 l s flow rate excessive water volume generates a feeble reverse backflow circulation with the formation of eddies in 1 11 l s case flows commence to emerge towards downstream small eddies are also present in the existing flow the features of the 1 39 l s flow rate are very similar to those of the 1 11 l s with the existing backflows 5 the double bridge scenario is also a fictional scenario with the combination of both submerged and atatürk bridge for 0 83 l s two regions form in the model according to the flow properties s shaped eddies are also observed for 1 11 l s s shaped eddies occur at the joining of all middle part points as regards the 1 39 l s flow rate once again two regions of flow formed 6 the experimental model results of this study indicate that the flow patterns vary significantly for different structural and flow rate conditions 6 future work in the present study the physical experimental models are developed to determine the horizontal water flow patterns in the golden horn under different bridge structures the wind also has an effect on the bosphorus strait it affects two layer flow etc and was not considered in the developed model however it is recommended that for a more comprehensive investigation of the hydrodynamics of the golden horn integration of these effects should be considered if suitable conditions exist also stream velocity can be measured at different depths and three dimensional 3d velocity profiles may be constructed to perform a detailed analysis in order to obtain information about base flows despite the simplified model used in this study velocity measurements approximately follow the field measurements present in the literature this implies that the essential features of the physical processes involved are well captured by

21559,functional control is key for any autonomous robot linking high level artificial intelligence with the robot actuators due to environmental disturbances model uncertainties and nonlinear dynamic systems reliable functional control is essential and improvements in the controller design can significantly benefit the overall vehicle performance even though there are many published studies considering the design of various advanced controllers most of them are not evaluated in physical experiments in this research four different control strategies have been investigated proportional integral derivative control pid sliding mode control smc backstepping control bc and fuzzy logic control flc the performances of these four controllers were simulated initially and evaluated by practical experiments in different conditions including various environmental disturbances and hydrodynamic coefficients the main contributions are as follows firstly this paper reports a comparison study between different types of controllers based on simulations and physical experiments in various conditions secondly this paper provides an improved smc algorithm combining the merits from linear control and nonlinear control and a customized second order flc method keywords auv rov control theories smc flc 1 introduction underwater vehicles have proved their ability in oceanographic research through mapping and monitoring the marine environment caress et al 2008 german et al 2008 such as gathering time series data by repeated water column surveys detailed bathymetric mapping of the ocean floor in areas of tectonic activity and performing under ice missions wynn et al 2014 marine autonomous systems also have an increasing range of applications in the defence and marine industries and policy sectors such as geohazard assessment associated with oil and gas infrastructure eddy lee and george 2004 in addition recent economic drivers such as rapidly increasing vessel fuel oil costs are making autonomous systems a potentially attractive proposition to organisations responsible for large scale and cost effective marine data collection programmes wynn et al 2014 generally autonomous underwater vehicles auvs do not need to communicate with the support ship or shore when submerged and solely depend on onboard battery packs mcgann et al 2008 hence an auv is expected to travel in the deep ocean and execute specific missions relying on functional control methodologies and decision making algorithms however a high degree of uncertainty in the hydrodynamic drag coefficients kaminer et al 1991 and environmental disturbances such as current hinder the effectiveness of conventional control laws a number of advanced control methodologies have been proposed to handle the high degree of uncertainty which characterizes underwater operations in terms of external disturbances system dynamics actuator forces sensor measurements and environmental structure caccia 2007 however most of these control strategies have only been verified by simulations because the physical characteristics of actuators and environmental factors are hard to estimate and simulate exactly controllers verified by simulation may not have the desired practical performances in this paper a sliding mode controller smc a fuzzy logic controller flc and a backstepping controller bc have been developed and are discussed smc is a model based nonlinear controller used to alter the dynamics of a nonlinear system by application of a discontinuous control signal that forces the system to slide along a cross section of the system s normal behavior fossen and sagatun 1991 all smcs are derived via the lyapunov function however it is challenging to predict the responses of the controller such as settling time and overshoot in contrast with a linear controller derived by pole placement methods which can have designed properties the smc proposed in this paper is divided into two parts a linear section and a nonlinear section in the linear section pole placement methods are used to reduce the settling time overshoot and chattering in the nonlinear section nonlinear and uncertainty factors are eliminated via smc based on the lyapunov control function backstepping is also a model based nonlinear controller furthermore it is a recursive design methodology for construction of both feedback control laws and associated lyapunov functions in a systematic manner fossen and strand 1999 the whole dynamic system is partitioned into subsystems because of this recursive structure designing of bcs usually begins with a known stable system and iterates to obtain new controllers for subsystems the process terminates when the final external control is reached although nonlinear backstepping designs are strongly related to feedback linearization a bc has been proposed in this paper by adding nonlinear damping to destabilize the nonlinear factors fuzzy logic control is an intelligent controller and is widely used in nonlinear dynamic systems the system states are described by fuzzy sets instead of binary variables true or false logical rules and operators are applied to generate the control signals hence fuzzy logic has the advantage that the solution to the problem can be cast in terms of the experiences of human operators or experts pedrycz 1993 a two input nonlinear flc has been constructed in this paper the inputs consist of heading angle error and angular velocity compared with a single input flc it can obtain a wider set of information before making a decision comparison experiments have been conducted not only with different disturbances but also under two different dynamic and hydrodynamic models therefore a discussion about the performances of the four controllers pid backstepping novel linear nonlinear smc and flc under different disturbance and different hydrodynamic models is provided this paper is organized as follows section 2 reviews previously reported results on functional control of underwater vehicles section 3 provides details of videoray pro 3 which is an rov used in the simulation and practical experiments and defines the model equations of the underwater vehicles used in this paper the decoupled dynamic equations and thruster models are also presented section 4 reports four control algorithms and stability analyses section 5 presents the simulation results in various conditions section 6 describes the experimental evaluations under different quantified disturbances and two different hydrodynamic models section 7 presents the discussion of controllers section 8 illustrates the conclusions of the paper 2 review of related work numerous studies have reported analytical and or simulation studies of fixed and adaptive model based control strategies for underwater vehicles but the majority of them do not report actual physical experimental performance evaluation of the proposed controllers fossen and sagatun 1991 kaminer et al 1991 feng and allen 2004 yu et al 2017 fjellstad and fossen 1994 fossen 1995 proposed two adaptive controllers based on barbalat s redundancy lyapunov like lemma in order to compensate for uncertainties in the input matrix due to partly known nonlinear thruster characteristics fossen and sagatun 1991 in this work a hybrid controller was proposed which consists of a switching term that compensates for uncertainties in the input matrix and an online parameter estimation algorithm however only simulation results are presented using adaptive sliding mode controller smc roberto cristic solved the problem of controlling an auv in diving manoeuvres cristi et al 1990 the smcs aim was to eliminate dynamic uncertainties the simulation results showed that the smc had satisfactory performance when uncertainties were high in order to eliminate the chattering induced by smc theory huan yin zhou constructed a sliding mode control approach using the hurwitz matrix zhou et al 2011 the approach was validated by simulations in the results the proposed methods reduced the chattering of smc successfully smcs have also been applied for designing fault tolerant controllers by corradini corradini et al 2011 in this work a sliding mode based approach has been used both for remotely operated vehicle rov control and fault isolation it was assumed that each thruster is an actuator potentially affected by faults whenever a failure is detected and identified a supervisor performs a control reconfiguration exploiting thruster redundancy in the simulation results the rov followed reference values through application of the proposed controller after the occurrence of a fault however these controllers were not compared with any other methodologies and no experimental results were presented kaminer applied h infinity synthesis theory to the design of a controller for an auv kaminer et al 1991 after linearization around the nominal operating point a multivariable controller was designed using standard techniques of h infinity theory the performance of the controller was again only evaluated in simulations a dynamic mode linearized controller which is a reduced order h infinity controller was proposed by feng feng and allen 2004 the reduced order problem was transformed into a rank minimization problem subject to the linear matrix inequality the simulation results showed that the reduced order h infinity controller had a smaller error offset than the full order h infinity controller as an alternative to model based controllers yu et al designed a simplified nonlinear fuzzy controller to address the problem of path following for an underactuated autonomous underwater vehicle yu et al 2017 they compared a two input fuzzy controller with a simplified one input fuzzy controller the simulation results showed robust path following performance under unknown environmental disturbances instead of designing advanced controllers fjellstad used a unit quaternion for attitude representation and an adaptive controller fjellstad and fossen 1994 in the simulation that was presented tracking with unit quaternion feedback and tracking with euler feedback are compared minowa designed a high gain observer for a robust control method to control towed underwater vehicles minowa and toda 2018 the underwater vehicles were inherently under influences of nonlinearities and uncertainties due to the flexible towing cables the high gain observer based controllers and a controller with a linear kalman filter were compared in simulations the results demonstrated that the proposed controller with a high gain observer had a robust performance a few studies have reported analytical simulation and experimental evaluation for reported controllers zhang designed an adaptive nonlinear second order sliding mode controller in order to reduce chattering motion caused by sliding surfaces zhang et al 2018 in lake experiments the proposed method was compared with other smcs the results showed that the proposed smc provided a faster response compared to a pd controller a linearized model based controller and a nonlinear model based controller with decoupled dynamic systems martin and whitcomb 2018 both of the model based controllers were based on lyapunov functions all three controllers were used on an rov and it was claimed that the model based controllers tracking error is significantly lower than that of the pd controller and the nonlinear control tracking error is slightly lower than that of the linearized controller it should be noted that the practical experiments were carried out without any environmental disturbances dukan proposed a dynamic positioning system for an rov dukan et al 2011 in this system a pid controller was implemented along with an observer based on an extended kalman filter the observer and doppler velocity log provided navigation information for the rov the experiments were carried out in the open sea so the external disturbances could not be quantified the software was developed for operating the minerva the rov name based on labview logan presented a comparison of h infinity mu synthesis and sliding mode controllers for heading and depth control of an auv logan 1994 in the work steering and diving were decoupled into independent subsystems it was claimed that the strength of the h infinity control is in dealing with unmodelled dynamics whilst the strength of the sliding mode design approach was providing a framework for accommodating the state dependent nonlinearities however only simulation results were provided and there was no experimental verification of the results innocenti used two different controllers to solve a trajectory following problem and compared the results innocenti and campa 1999 in the work structured uncertainties induced by errors in the computation of hydrodynamic coefficients dynamic linearization and truncation and unknown disturbances were included in the control synthesis one controller was designed based on an smc whilst the other was created based on linear matrix inequalities synthesis techniques lmi according to the comparative simulation results the lmi region can be adjusted to contain the closed loop poles so that the controller is more robust in contrast the sm controller had chattering even though it could successfully eliminate uncertainties in this paper an improved smc algorithm and a customized second order flc have been proposed and it also reports the comparison results between controllers of different types through both simulations and experimental testing especially in practical test the results of these controllers are presented after the dynamic model is changed in addition both the simulation and the experimental work have evaluated the controller performances under quantified external disturbances 3 mathematical model of the vehicle the videoray pro 3 has been used for both the simulations and practical tests it is a remotely operated vehicle rov with a camera and it is powered through a cable as shown in fig 1 it is propelled by two horizontal thrusters and one vertical thruster the properties and coefficients for videoray pro 3 were obtained from wang and clark 2007 and are presented in appendix a in order to find out the robustness of controllers to variance of the hydrodynamic and dynamic models the vehicle has been modified with a tube installed on the bottom as shown at fig 2 in this way the dynamic and hydrodynamic model of the vehicle have been changed and the controllers have been tested with the same coefficients on the modified rov in this section the mathematical model of the rov is derived a generic underwater vehicle has six degrees of freedom dof due to the hydrodynamic characteristics of the hull shape of the videoray pro 3 the rotations of roll and pitch are negligible hence they have been removed from the dynamic model for the videoray pro 3 according to fossen fossen et al 1994 the kinetic and dynamic models are 1 η j ψ v 2 m v τ c v v d v v g η where η x y z ψ and v u ν w r represent the state vectors for attitude and velocity the rigid body mass matrix is presented as 3 m r b m r b t m 0 0 0 0 m 0 0 0 0 m 0 0 0 0 i z the added mass matrix can be written as 4 m a m a t x u 0 0 0 0 y v 0 0 0 0 z w 0 0 0 0 n r the coriolis matrix is 5 c ν c t ν 0 0 0 m v 0 0 0 m u 0 0 0 0 m v m u 0 0 hence m can be written as 6 m m r b m a the damping is shown in 7 including linear d l and quadratic damping d q 7 d ν d l d q ν where the

1 3 1 decoupled mode in the section the speed model steering model and diving dynamic model are decoupled from general dynamic model 3 1 1 forward speed control model as mentioned before the interactions from sway roll pitch and yaw are neglected it suggests that the speed equation can be written as fossen et al 1994 12 m x u u x u u u u τ x x e x t where u is the surge velocity x e x t is external disturbances due to waves and currents τ x is a forward force generated by the pair of thrusters 3 1 2 steering equations of motion automatic steering or heading control for videoray pro 3 can be achieved by means of the pair of horizontal thrusters the steering motion model can be written as 13 ψ r 14 i z n r r n r n r r r r τ r where τ r is a turning moment provided by the pair of horizontal thrusters 3 1 3 diving equations of motion for videoray pro 3 the depth is controlled by means of a vertical thruster hence the diving motion model can be written simply as 15 z w 16 m z w w z w z w w w w w b τ d where τ d is a force provided by the vertical thruster 3 1 4 thruster mode the thrusters produce the forces and moments acting on the vehicle an underwater vehicle s thrusters both for propulsion and directional control are highly nonlinear actuators as there are fixed pitch propellers on the vidoeray pro 3 the thruster force t can be calculated by the forward speed u of the vehicle the advance speed u a and the propeller speed n m blanke 1981 17 t ρ d 4 α 1 α 2 u a n d n n where ρ is the water density d is the diameter of the propeller and α 1 and α 2 are constants given by the propeller s properties a comprehensive study of thrusters and their influence on underwater vehicle maneuverability was presented in yoerger et al 1990 by considering the energy balance of a control volume about a thruster a simplified nonlinear equation for thrust t can be derived as 18 n β τ m o t o r α n n 19 t c t n n where τ m o t o r is the input torque supplied by the thruster s motor α β and c t are thruster constants this indicates that there is a mapping from the thrust input signal to thruster force wang and clark 2007 the mapping can be written as a membership function f t 20 t f t c t where c t is the thruster input signal electric current with time t and t is thruster force 3 1 5 layout of the thrusters the thrusters on videoray pro 3 are designed in such a way that the input thrust command is a value between 250 and 250 where the mapping curve used in this case was the one derived by wang and clark 2007 at fig 3 the thruster configuration of the rov is presented and the thruster force t 1 t 2 and t 3 are computed by a custom thrust allocation function 21 t 1 τ x 2 τ r 2 d 22 t 2 τ x 2 τ r 2 d 23 t 3 τ d 4 control methodologies for hovering underwater vehicles with one vertical thruster and two horizontal thrusters the 4 dof dynamic model can be divided into three non interacting subsystems for speed control steering and diving these subsystems are controlled by means of the individual thrusters in the simulations and tests the forward speed was set to be constant a pid controller has been implemented for diving control the steering control using different control strategies is discussed in this section the length of the cable tethered to the rov is less than 10m it is also coated with foam material to attain neutral buoyancy so that the influence of the cable on the dynamics of the vehicle is slight it is neglected in this section 4 1 pid the pid controller is widely used due to its simplicity and effectiveness for the rov the pid algorithm is as follows the nomoto first order model is described as 24 ψ r 25 r 1 t u l r k t u l 2 τ r the pid robust control law for vehicle heading is 26 τ r t k l u 2 τ f f k p e k d e k i 0 t e τ d τ 27 e ψ ψ d 28 τ f f 1 t u l r d r d the control gains k p k i and k d can be found via various methods ogata 2002 here the pole placement method fossen and ross 2006 was applied for fitting parameters in the control laws for the case k i 0 the error dynamics become 29 e 1 t u l k d e k p e 0 this suggests that 30 k d 2 ω n ζ u l 1 t 31 k p ω n 2 where ω n and ζ are pole placement design parameters the time constant for the integrator k i may be chosen as approximately ω n 10 4 2 improved smc method sliding mode control is a model based controller for solving nonlinear system control issues utkin et al 2009 the proposed smc method benefits from the linear control characteristics which is different from the traditional controller the sliding mode control for heading control is derived as follows the heading mode is 32 ψ r 33 i z n r r n r n r r r r τ r the above is a nonlinear system the sliding space s space is defined as 34 s λ 1 ψ λ 2 r 35 ψ ψ ψ d the derivative of the s space is 36 s λ 1 ψ λ 2 r λ 1 r λ 2 r where λ 1 0 and λ 2 0 consider the control lyapunov function clf 37 v s 1 2 s 2 differentiating the clf 38 v s s s s λ 1 r λ 2 r s λ 2 λ 1 s λ 1 2 λ 2 ψ λ 2 r the r can be gained from the model equations 39 r 1 i z n r τ r n r n r r r r the smc control law is 40 τ r n ˆ r n ˆ r r r r i ˆ z n ˆ r λ 1 2 ψ λ 2 2 η s i g n s the s i g n function is replaced by the tanh because the tanh function is continuous and almost equal to the s i g n function but is differentiable the smc control law can be written as 41 τ r n ˆ r n ˆ r r r r i ˆ z n ˆ r λ 1 2 ψ λ 2 2 η tanh s where the hat symbol n ˆ i ˆ indicates estimated parameters from the smc control law the control input can be decoupled into a linear part and a nonlinear part 42 τ r τ l i n e a r τ n o n l i n e a r 43 τ l i n e a r i ˆ z n ˆ r λ 2 2 ψ 44 τ n o n l i n e a r n ˆ r n ˆ r r r r i ˆ z n ˆ r η tanh s for the linear part the dynamic system can be described as 45 ψ r 46 i z n r r n r r k l ψ 47 k l i ˆ z n ˆ r λ 2 2 0 here r is usually a small value hence r r has been neglected after applying the laplace transform it becomes 48 ψ s k l i z n r s 2 n r s k l ψ d 49 ψ d s ψ d 1 s where s indicates the frequency domain the linear part can be considered as a second order dynamic system then the damping ratio ζ becomes 50 ζ n r 2 k l i z n r the undamped natural frequency ω n is 51 ω n k l i z n r hence the λ 1 and λ 2 can be derived from the specific ζ and ω n the error distance between the actual parameters and estimated parameters are presented as follows 52 e n ˆ r n ˆ r r r n r n r r r 53 ℓ e i ˆ z n ˆ r i z n r from 42 to 51 the control law of smc is divided into two parts one is the linear part and the other is the nonlinear part the nonlinear part is derived by the traditional smc method but in the linear part the pole placement method is applied to improve the properties of transient response such as delay time rise time settling time and overshoot hence the proposed smc inherits the merits from linear controllers and nonlinear controllers it can be robust to environmental factors and hydrodynamic coefficients but also has a quick response with small overshoot compared with other nonlinear controllers 4 2 1 stability analysis the derivative of the control lyapunov function is described as 54 v s s λ 2 λ 1 s λ 1 2 λ 2 ψ λ 2 r substituting 36 and 40 into 54 the derivative of the clf becomes 55 v s s λ 2 λ 1 s ℓ e 1 λ 1 2 λ 2 ψ e i z n r ℓ e η tanh s where λ 1 0 λ 2 λ 1 λ 2 λ 1 and e 0 ℓ e 1 hence the estimated terms are bounded and can be rewritten as 56 ξ 1 1 ℓ e λ 1 2 λ 2 ψ 57 ξ 2 e i z n r therefore 58 v s λ 2 λ 1 s 2 ξ 1 ξ 2 s ℓ e η tanh s s because ℓ e is positive η is chosen as 59 η ξ 1 ξ 2 ℓ e hence the derivative of clf becomes 60 v s λ 2 λ 1 s 2 ℓ e η tanh s ξ 1 ξ 2 s 0 therefore the control law based on smc is stable 4 3 backstepping control backstepping control bc is also based on the control lyapunov function krstic et al 1995 the bc for heading angle is designed based on previous work from fossen fossen and ross 2006 it has two steps because of the second order nature of the mathematic model the first step starts with z 1 the control lyapunov function is 61 v 1 1 2 z 1 2 the sliding surface is defined as 62 z 1 λ ψ ψ d hence 63 v 1 z 1 z 1 z 1 λ ψ z 1 λ r choosing λ r as the virtual controller that is 64 λ r κ z 2 gives 65 v 1 z 1 κ z 2 the stabilising function κ is chosen as 66 κ k 1 z 1 where k 1 0 is the feedback gain while the new state z 2 is left undefined until the next step this finally gives 67 v 1 k 1 z 1 2 z 1 z 2 the second step starts with z 2 68 z 2 λ r κ the next clf is 69 v 2 v 1 1 2 z 2 2 hence 70 v 2 v 1 z 2 z 2 k 1 z 1 2 z 1 z 2 z 2 λ r κ substituting the dynamic heading model into the expression for r gives 71 v 2 k 1 z 1 2 z 2 z 1 λ i z n r τ r n r n r r r κ the control law is described as 72 τ r n r n r r r i z n r λ κ z 1 k 2 z 2 2 where k 2 0 finally giving 73 v 2 k 1 z 1 2 k 2 z 2 2 0 therefore the proposed controller based on bc is stable when implementing the control law 74 κ k 1 r 4 4 customized second order fuzzy logic control a fuzzy logic control flc system may be designed based on human operator experience or a control engineer s knowledge zimmermann 1996 the proposed flc was designed for the underwater vehicle based on the previous work from jinfeng 2016 the input variables ψ and r are heading error and heading angular velocity respectively hence it is a second order flc method and customizes the rules set for the videoray pro 3 the process of fuzzy inference is shown in fig 4 the inputs are fuzzified first according to the membership functions so that the input variables are described by fuzzy sets in the inference process rules and logical operators are used to map the fuzzified inputs on to the fuzzified outputs the rules list is presented in table 1 in table 1 nb is negative big ns indicates negative small and nm indicates negative middle similarly p is positive and z means zero finally the defuzzification generates the output variable σ r this process also relies on related membership functions the input fuzzification membership functions are presented in fig 5 and fig 6 and the output membership function is presented in fig 7 4 4 1 stability analysis for flc the clf method can be employed to check its stability the approach is analogous to the stability analysis of the smc the space s f can be regarded as 75 s f ψ r the derivative of the clf is described as 76 v s f s f s f s f ψ r then 77 v s f s f ψ 1 i z n r τ r n r n r r r r because the membership functions are piecewise functions because there are 7 7 49 rules there are 49 situations but for each situation ψ and r are bounded hence it can be verified that for each situation the generated output τ r can make sure that v 0 5 simulation the controllers were simulated on the videoray pro 3 in c in the simulations the desired heading angle was 3 r a d 172 o and the initial heading angle was 0 r a d 0 o in order to make presentation clear the degree is used in the results rather than radian firstly the controllers were simulated in noise free conditions and the results are shown in fig 8 the simulation was then run with added noise on the yaw angular velocity as shown in fig 10 the associated control signals are plotted at figs 9 and fig 11 the noise n is considered as white noise it follows a gaussian distribution as 78 n n 0 σ s 2 the unit is r a d s the performance may be analysed in terms of several control properties settling time the settling time is the time required for the response curve to reach and stay within a range about the desired value of a size specified in terms of an absolute percentage of the desired value in this case 5 overshoot the overshoot is the maximum peak value of the response curve if the peak value is much bigger than the desired value then it is common to use the overshoot it is defined by 79 o v e r s h o o t c t p q where c is the response curve and t p is the peak time the peak time is the time required for the response to reach the first peak of the overshoot q is the desired value average error the average error is used to represent the steady error it is defined by 80 e a v e r a g e t t s t i ψ t t i t s where t s is settling time and t i is the length of total time because the numerator in the polynomial is a linear term the unit of e a v e r a g e is o degree variance of error the variance of error is used to describe the oscillation of the response curve after t s it is defined by 81 v a r e t s t i ψ t e a v e r a g e 2 t i t s because the numerator in the polynomial is quadratic the unit of v a r e is o 2 the results of the analysis of the controller outputs are shown in table 2 for the case without any noise the four controllers had very similar performances due to the pole placement method used for tuning the pid controller had a small average error relative to the bc and flc this indicates that the steady error of a pid in idealised conditions can be small the smc had the shortest settling time smallest average error and smallest variance of error among the four controllers the reason for this is that the smc has two parts a linear part and a nonlinear part the merits of the linear controller improve the performance of the smc meanwhile the performances of the bc and flc were very similar for the case with added noise the pid controller ceased to perform satisfactorily the settling time average error and variance of error all increased dramatically this suggested that the pid cannot control the underwater vehicle effectively the model based nonlinear controllers bc and smc and the intelligent controller flc were still able to control the vehicle towards the desired heading angle compared to the bc the flc had a small average error but a big variance of error this means that the heading of the vehicle controlled by the flc had a large oscillations as shown in fig 10 but the centre of the oscillation was close to the desired heading angle the performance of the smc also declined sharply the reason for this was that the linear control part of the proposed smc had a negative impact on the overall performance the simulations were executed under three assumptions 1 the dynamic model parameters were known exactly and never changed 2 the actuators can produce the forces and moments required by the control laws immediately 3 the disturbances are white noise following a gaussian distribution in the normal condition the vehicle will travel at constant velocity and the environmental noise is limited and obeys the gaussian distribution hence the dynamic and hydrodynamic characteristics are fixed in the real world the vehicle may encounter changing conditions therefore the next section presents the practical experiments for comparison applying the way point guidance by line of sight los the controllers can keep the vehicle tracking desired trajectories the path is given by a set of way points 1 0 1 0 5 0 0 5 0 1 1 1 1 1 5 0 1 5 where the unit is meters the results are presented in fig 12 and fig 13 the path following results are consistent with the results for heading angle control in the noise free condition all controllers can guide the vehicle to follow the desired path but pid had a bigger offset compared with the others however in the noisy condition the pid nearly failed the proposed smc turned the vehicle with smallest cross track error among these controllers 6 experiments the experimental tests were carried out in the towing tank at newcastle university bowes 2010 where quantified disturbances could be generated the vehicle was submerged keeping depth about 0 3m the controllers were initially evaluated without any disturbances and results are shown in fig 14 and then waves were introduced as shown in fig 15 the height of the waves was 0 030 m and the frequency was 1 0 h z finally larger waves were generated in the tank to verify the robustness of the four controllers the height of the larger waves was 0 050 m and the frequency was still 1 0 h z as shown in fig 16 in the experiments the desired heading angle is 210 o the rov could make a turn from 360 o to 210 o but in order to evaluate the heading controllers performance clearly the rov started at 0 o generally waves only affect the motion of surface ships with submerged vehicles influenced by current however in shallow water underwater vehicles would be affected by waves furthermore the waves in the towing tank can effectively cause a current as well these conditions could therefore be very close to the realistic conditions that an rov might encounter the results analysis is presented in table 3 for the results without any disturbances the model based nonlinear controllers had fast responses as shown in table 3 although the pid had a longer settling time the variance of error of the pid was 12 94 the smallest value among the four controllers in contrast the flc had a large variance of error and overshoot but the settling time of the flc was shorter than that of the others this indicates that the linear controllers were much more stable but the others are more robust for the proposed smc the linear part of the design can improve its performance in terms of the variance of error and the nonlinear part can result in a small average error and short settling time for the experiments with disturbances as shown in figs 15 and fig 16 the results were analogous to the simulation results with the performances of the pid declining significantly and the average error and variance of error continuously increased conversely the variance of error for the model based nonlinear controllers increased slowly the settling time remained almost at the same value the average error was actually smaller than that in the disturbance free situations because the waves speeded up the oscillation frequency of the rov heading angle the average error converged to zero and it can be seen that the model based nonlinear controllers bc and smc were more robust than the other controllers for the flc settling time remained similar the overshoot and average error increased significantly but the variance of error increased largely this indicates that the flc had large oscillations and in fact large overshoot and significant oscillations are common issues for intelligent controllers narendra and mukhopadhyay 1992 the experiments with the tube as shown in fig 17 were used to show the robustness of these controllers because the water tight tube is installed on the bottom of the vehicle it impacts the hydrodynamic parameters of dramatically meanwhile the parameters of the controllers remained the same as the previous tests therefore this test can indicate the robustness of these controllers to hydrodynamic variation according to the results the flc fuzzy logic control and pid controllers failed in this test whereas the nonlinear state controllers were able to guide the vehicle to the desired heading angle successfully in detail the bc can make the vehicle turn to the desired angle more rapidly than the smc but the smc is more stable than bc due to the large oscillation 7 discussion based on the results of simulations and experimental evaluations the features of different controllers are summarized following 1 the linear controller pid has a long settling time and large average error but a small variance of error after disturbances were added the errors increased rapidly therefore the controller is more stable but less robust relative to the others however after the rov model was changed it failed to guide the vehicle to the reference heading angle this shows that the pid is sensitive to hydrodynamic model variance after the model was changed the parameters in the pid controller need to be upgraded 2 the proposed sliding mode controller consists of a linear controller and a sliding mode controller due to the pole placement methods used for the linear controller it was more stable compared with the bc meanwhile the sliding mode control part enabled it to be more robust than the other controllers it is also robust to model variance because it is still able to lead the vehicle to turn to the desired heading angle after the tube is added 3 the backstepping controller is a model based nonlinear controller derived by using the lyapunov function when the external disturbances were increased the performance of the bc was unchanged therefore it is relatively robust in addition it has a small overshoot compared with smc similarly to the smc the bc can work well after the rov model is changed that shows that the nonlinear controllers have greater robustness to model variance 4 the fuzzy logic controller is an intelligent controller it is constructed through experts knowledge rather than mathematical modelling hence it is relatively easy to understand and to get satisfactory performance from the logical operators however it has large oscillations this drawback is common in intelligent controllers narendra and mukhopadhyay 1992 after the rov modification the flc fails in guiding the vehicle which indicates that the member function and rules need to be upgraded after the modification of the rov 8 conclusions in this paper a vehicle mathematical model was constructed based on the configuration of the videoray pro 3 with the dynamic equations decoupled into three subsystems forward speed diving and steering four different control strategies were then tested for heading control this paper has made two main contributions firstly a comparison of the four different controllers from three different control algorithms is made these controllers are evaluated not only by simulations but also by practical experiments with quantified disturbances and different hydrodynamic models the performances from the controllers are compared and discussed based on their theories secondly an improved smc and a customized second order flc have been developed the proposed smc benefits from the advantages of both linear control and nonlinear control and has better performances over the traditional backstepping nonlinear controller the flc is built into a second order structure with customized rules set for the videoray pro 3 in the next stage the proposed smc methodology will be applied as a functional controller in the artificial intelligence

21559,functional control is key for any autonomous robot linking high level artificial intelligence with the robot actuators due to environmental disturbances model uncertainties and nonlinear dynamic systems reliable functional control is essential and improvements in the controller design can significantly benefit the overall vehicle performance even though there are many published studies considering the design of various advanced controllers most of them are not evaluated in physical experiments in this research four different control strategies have been investigated proportional integral derivative control pid sliding mode control smc backstepping control bc and fuzzy logic control flc the performances of these four controllers were simulated initially and evaluated by practical experiments in different conditions including various environmental disturbances and hydrodynamic coefficients the main contributions are as follows firstly this paper reports a comparison study between different types of controllers based on simulations and physical experiments in various conditions secondly this paper provides an improved smc algorithm combining the merits from linear control and nonlinear control and a customized second order flc method keywords auv rov control theories smc flc 1 introduction underwater vehicles have proved their ability in oceanographic research through mapping and monitoring the marine environment caress et al 2008 german et al 2008 such as gathering time series data by repeated water column surveys detailed bathymetric mapping of the ocean floor in areas of tectonic activity and performing under ice missions wynn et al 2014 marine autonomous systems also have an increasing range of applications in the defence and marine industries and policy sectors such as geohazard assessment associated with oil and gas infrastructure eddy lee and george 2004 in addition recent economic drivers such as rapidly increasing vessel fuel oil costs are making autonomous systems a potentially attractive proposition to organisations responsible for large scale and cost effective marine data collection programmes wynn et al 2014 generally autonomous underwater vehicles auvs do not need to communicate with the support ship or shore when submerged and solely depend on onboard battery packs mcgann et al 2008 hence an auv is expected to travel in the deep ocean and execute specific missions relying on functional control methodologies and decision making algorithms however a high degree of uncertainty in the hydrodynamic drag coefficients kaminer et al 1991 and environmental disturbances such as current hinder the effectiveness of conventional control laws a number of advanced control methodologies have been proposed to handle the high degree of uncertainty which characterizes underwater operations in terms of external disturbances system dynamics actuator forces sensor measurements and environmental structure caccia 2007 however most of these control strategies have only been verified by simulations because the physical characteristics of actuators and environmental factors are hard to estimate and simulate exactly controllers verified by simulation may not have the desired practical performances in this paper a sliding mode controller smc a fuzzy logic controller flc and a backstepping controller bc have been developed and are discussed smc is a model based nonlinear controller used to alter the dynamics of a nonlinear system by application of a discontinuous control signal that forces the system to slide along a cross section of the system s normal behavior fossen and sagatun 1991 all smcs are derived via the lyapunov function however it is challenging to predict the responses of the controller such as settling time and overshoot in contrast with a linear controller derived by pole placement methods which can have designed properties the smc proposed in this paper is divided into two parts a linear section and a nonlinear section in the linear section pole placement methods are used to reduce the settling time overshoot and chattering in the nonlinear section nonlinear and uncertainty factors are eliminated via smc based on the lyapunov control function backstepping is also a model based nonlinear controller furthermore it is a recursive design methodology for construction of both feedback control laws and associated lyapunov functions in a systematic manner fossen and strand 1999 the whole dynamic system is partitioned into subsystems because of this recursive structure designing of bcs usually begins with a known stable system and iterates to obtain new controllers for subsystems the process terminates when the final external control is reached although nonlinear backstepping designs are strongly related to feedback linearization a bc has been proposed in this paper by adding nonlinear damping to destabilize the nonlinear factors fuzzy logic control is an intelligent controller and is widely used in nonlinear dynamic systems the system states are described by fuzzy sets instead of binary variables true or false logical rules and operators are applied to generate the control signals hence fuzzy logic has the advantage that the solution to the problem can be cast in terms of the experiences of human operators or experts pedrycz 1993 a two input nonlinear flc has been constructed in this paper the inputs consist of heading angle error and angular velocity compared with a single input flc it can obtain a wider set of information before making a decision comparison experiments have been conducted not only with different disturbances but also under two different dynamic and hydrodynamic models therefore a discussion about the performances of the four controllers pid backstepping novel linear nonlinear smc and flc under different disturbance and different hydrodynamic models is provided this paper is organized as follows section 2 reviews

presents the discussion of controllers section 8 illustrates the conclusions of the paper 2 review of related work numerous studies have reported analytical and or simulation studies of fixed and adaptive model based control strategies for underwater vehicles but the majority of them do not report actual physical experimental performance evaluation of the proposed controllers fossen and sagatun 1991 kaminer et al 1991 feng and allen 2004 yu et al 2017 fjellstad and fossen 1994 fossen 1995 proposed two adaptive controllers based on barbalat s redundancy lyapunov like lemma in order to compensate for uncertainties in the input matrix due to partly known nonlinear thruster characteristics fossen and sagatun 1991 in this work a hybrid controller was proposed which consists of a switching term that compensates for uncertainties in the input matrix and an online parameter estimation algorithm however only simulation results are presented using adaptive sliding mode controller smc roberto cristic solved the problem of controlling an auv in diving manoeuvres cristi et al 1990 the smcs aim was to eliminate dynamic uncertainties the simulation results showed that the smc had satisfactory performance when uncertainties were high in order to eliminate the chattering induced by smc theory huan yin zhou constructed a sliding mode control approach using the hurwitz matrix zhou et al 2011 the approach was validated by simulations in the results the proposed methods reduced the chattering of smc successfully smcs have also been applied for designing fault tolerant controllers by corradini corradini et al 2011 in this work a sliding mode based approach has been used both for remotely operated vehicle rov control and fault isolation it was assumed that each thruster is an actuator potentially affected by faults whenever a failure is detected and identified a supervisor performs a control reconfiguration exploiting thruster redundancy in the simulation results the rov followed reference values through application of the proposed controller after the occurrence of a fault however these controllers were not compared with any other methodologies and no experimental results were presented kaminer applied h infinity synthesis theory to the design of a controller for an auv kaminer et al 1991 after linearization around the nominal operating point a multivariable controller was designed using standard techniques of h infinity theory the performance of the controller was again only evaluated in simulations a dynamic mode linearized controller which is a reduced order h infinity controller was proposed by feng feng and allen 2004 the reduced order problem was transformed into a rank minimization problem subject to the linear matrix inequality the simulation results showed that the reduced order h infinity controller had a smaller error offset than the full order h infinity controller as an alternative to model based controllers yu et al designed a simplified nonlinear fuzzy controller to address the problem of path following for an underactuated autonomous underwater vehicle yu et al 2017 they compared a two input fuzzy controller with a simplified one input fuzzy controller the simulation results showed robust path following performance under unknown environmental disturbances instead of designing advanced controllers fjellstad used a unit quaternion for attitude representation and an adaptive controller fjellstad and fossen 1994 in the simulation that was presented tracking with unit quaternion feedback and tracking with euler feedback are compared minowa designed a high gain observer for a robust control method to control towed underwater vehicles minowa and toda 2018 the underwater vehicles were inherently under influences of nonlinearities and uncertainties due to the flexible towing cables the high gain observer based controllers and a controller with a linear kalman filter were compared in simulations the results demonstrated that the proposed controller with a high gain observer had a robust performance a few studies have reported analytical simulation and experimental evaluation for reported controllers zhang designed an adaptive nonlinear second order sliding mode controller in order to reduce chattering motion caused by sliding surfaces zhang et al 2018 in lake experiments the proposed method was compared with other smcs the results showed that the proposed smc provided a faster response compared to a pd controller a linearized model based controller and a nonlinear model based controller with decoupled dynamic systems martin and whitcomb 2018 both of the model based controllers were based on lyapunov functions all three controllers were used on an rov and it was claimed that the model based controllers tracking error is significantly lower than that of the pd controller and the nonlinear control tracking error is slightly lower than that of the linearized controller it should be noted that the practical experiments were carried out without any environmental disturbances dukan proposed a dynamic positioning system for an rov dukan et al 2011 in this system a pid controller was implemented along with an observer based on an extended kalman filter the observer and doppler velocity log provided navigation information for the rov the experiments were carried out in the open sea so the external disturbances could not be quantified the software was developed for operating the minerva the rov name based on labview logan presented a comparison of h infinity mu synthesis and sliding mode controllers for heading and depth control of an auv logan 1994 in the work steering and diving were decoupled into independent subsystems it was claimed that the strength of the h infinity control is in dealing with unmodelled dynamics whilst the strength of the sliding mode design approach was providing a framework for accommodating the state dependent nonlinearities however only simulation results were provided and there was no experimental verification of the results innocenti used two different controllers to solve a trajectory following problem and compared the results innocenti and campa 1999 in the work structured uncertainties induced by errors in the computation of hydrodynamic coefficients dynamic linearization and truncation and unknown disturbances were included in the control synthesis one controller was designed based on an smc whilst the other was created based on linear matrix inequalities synthesis techniques lmi according to the comparative simulation results the lmi region can be adjusted to contain the closed loop poles so that the controller is more robust in contrast the sm controller had chattering even though it could successfully eliminate uncertainties in this paper an improved smc algorithm and a customized second order flc have been proposed and it also reports the comparison results between controllers of different types through both simulations and experimental testing especially in practical test the results of these controllers are presented after the dynamic model is changed in addition both the simulation and the experimental work have evaluated the controller performances under quantified external disturbances 3 mathematical model of the vehicle the videoray pro 3 has been used for both the simulations and practical tests it is a remotely operated vehicle rov with a camera and it is powered through a cable as shown in fig 1 it is propelled by two horizontal thrusters and one vertical thruster the properties and coefficients for videoray pro 3 were obtained from wang and clark 2007 and are presented in appendix a in order to find out the robustness of controllers to variance of the hydrodynamic and dynamic models the vehicle has been modified with a tube installed on the bottom as shown at fig 2 in this way the dynamic and hydrodynamic model of the vehicle have been changed and the controllers have been tested with the same coefficients on the modified rov in this section the mathematical model of the rov is derived a generic underwater vehicle has six degrees of freedom dof due to the hydrodynamic characteristics of the hull shape of the videoray pro 3 the rotations of roll and pitch are negligible hence they have been removed from the dynamic model for the videoray pro 3 according to fossen fossen et al 1994 the kinetic and dynamic models are 1 η j ψ v 2 m v τ c v v d v v g η where η x y z ψ and v u ν w r represent the state vectors for attitude and velocity the rigid body mass matrix is presented as 3 m r b m r b t m 0 0 0 0 m 0 0 0 0 m 0 0 0 0 i z the added mass matrix can be written as 4 m a m a t x u 0 0 0 0 y v 0 0 0 0 z w 0 0 0 0 n r the coriolis matrix is 5 c ν c t ν 0 0 0 m v 0 0 0 m u 0 0 0 0 m v m u 0 0 hence m can be written as 6 m m r b m a the damping is shown in 7 including linear d l and quadratic damping d q 7 d ν d l d q ν where the

1 3 1 decoupled mode in the section the speed model steering model and diving dynamic model are decoupled from general dynamic model 3 1 1 forward speed control model as mentioned before the interactions from sway roll pitch and yaw are neglected it suggests that the speed equation can be written as fossen et al 1994 12 m x u u x u u u u τ x x e x t where u is the surge velocity x e x t is external disturbances due to waves and currents τ x is a forward force generated by the pair of thrusters 3 1 2 steering equations of motion automatic steering or heading control for videoray pro 3 can be achieved by means of the pair of horizontal thrusters the steering motion model can be written as 13 ψ r 14 i z n r r n r n r r r r τ r where τ r is a turning moment provided by the pair of horizontal thrusters 3 1 3 diving equations of motion for videoray pro 3 the depth is controlled by means of a vertical thruster hence the diving motion model can be written simply as 15 z w 16 m z w w z w z w w w w w b τ d where τ d is a force provided by the vertical thruster 3 1 4 thruster mode the thrusters produce the forces and moments acting on the vehicle an underwater vehicle s thrusters both for propulsion and directional control are highly nonlinear actuators as there are fixed pitch propellers on the vidoeray pro 3 the thruster force t can be calculated by the forward speed u of the vehicle the advance speed u a and the propeller speed n m blanke 1981 17 t ρ d 4 α 1 α 2 u a n d n n where ρ is the water density d is the diameter of the propeller and α 1 and α 2 are constants given by the propeller s properties a comprehensive study of thrusters and their influence on underwater vehicle maneuverability was presented in yoerger et al 1990 by considering the energy balance of a control volume about a thruster a simplified nonlinear equation for thrust t can be derived as 18 n β τ m o t o r α n n 19 t c t n n where τ m o t o r is the input torque supplied by the thruster s motor α β and c t are thruster constants this indicates that there is a mapping from the thrust input signal to thruster force wang and clark 2007 the mapping can be written as a membership function f t 20 t f t c t where c t is the thruster input signal electric current with time t and t is thruster force 3 1 5 layout of the thrusters the thrusters on videoray pro 3 are designed in such a way that the input thrust command is a value between 250 and 250 where the mapping curve used in this case was the one derived by wang and clark 2007 at fig 3 the thruster configuration of the rov is presented and the thruster force t 1 t 2 and t 3 are computed by a custom thrust allocation function 21 t 1 τ x 2 τ r 2 d 22 t 2 τ x 2 τ r 2 d 23 t 3 τ d 4 control methodologies for hovering underwater vehicles with one vertical thruster and two horizontal thrusters the 4 dof dynamic model can be divided into three non interacting subsystems for speed control steering and diving these subsystems are controlled by means of the individual thrusters in the simulations and tests the forward speed was set to be constant a pid controller has been implemented for diving control the steering control using different control strategies is discussed in this section the length of the cable tethered to the rov is less than 10m it is also coated with foam material to attain neutral buoyancy so that the influence of the cable on the dynamics of the vehicle is slight it is neglected in this section 4 1 pid the pid controller is widely used due to its simplicity and effectiveness for the rov the pid algorithm is as follows the nomoto first order model is described as 24 ψ r 25 r 1 t u l r k t u l 2 τ r the pid robust control law for vehicle heading is 26 τ r t k l u 2 τ f f k p e k d e k i 0 t e τ d τ 27 e ψ ψ d 28 τ f f 1 t u l r d r d the control gains k p k i and k d can be found via various methods ogata 2002 here the pole placement method fossen and ross 2006 was applied for fitting parameters in the control laws for the case k i 0 the error dynamics become 29 e 1 t u l k d e k p e 0 this suggests that 30 k d 2 ω n ζ u l 1 t 31 k p ω n 2 where ω n and ζ are pole placement design parameters the time constant for the integrator k i may be chosen as approximately ω n 10 4 2 improved smc method sliding mode control is a model based controller for solving nonlinear system control issues utkin et al 2009 the proposed smc method benefits from the linear control characteristics which is different from the traditional controller the sliding mode control for heading control is derived as follows the heading mode is 32 ψ r 33 i z n r r n r n r r r r τ r the above is a nonlinear system the sliding space s space is defined as 34 s λ 1 ψ λ 2 r 35 ψ ψ ψ d the derivative of the s space is 36 s λ 1 ψ λ 2 r λ 1 r λ 2 r where λ 1 0 and λ 2 0 consider the control lyapunov function clf 37 v s 1 2 s 2 differentiating the clf 38 v s s s s λ 1 r λ 2 r s λ 2 λ 1 s λ 1 2 λ 2 ψ λ 2 r the r can be gained from the model equations 39 r 1 i z n r τ r n r n r r r r the smc control law is 40 τ r n ˆ r n ˆ r r r r i ˆ z n ˆ r λ 1 2 ψ λ 2 2 η s i g n s the s i g n function is replaced by the tanh because the tanh function is continuous and almost equal to the s i g n function but is differentiable the smc control law can be written as 41 τ r n ˆ r n ˆ r r r r i ˆ z n ˆ r λ 1 2 ψ λ 2 2 η tanh s where the hat symbol n ˆ i ˆ indicates estimated parameters from the smc control law the control input can be decoupled into a linear part and a nonlinear part 42 τ r τ l i n e a r τ n o n l i n e a r 43 τ l i n e a r i ˆ z n ˆ r λ 2 2 ψ 44 τ n o n l i n e a r n ˆ r n ˆ r r r r i ˆ z n ˆ r η tanh s for the linear part the dynamic system can be described as 45 ψ r 46 i z n r r n r r k l ψ 47 k l i ˆ z n ˆ r λ 2 2 0 here r is usually a small value hence r r has been neglected after applying the laplace transform it becomes 48 ψ s k l i z n r s 2 n r s k l ψ d 49 ψ d s ψ d 1 s where s indicates the frequency domain the linear part can be considered as a second order dynamic system then the damping ratio ζ becomes 50 ζ n r 2 k l i z n r the undamped natural frequency ω n is 51 ω n k l i z n r hence the λ 1 and λ 2 can be derived from the specific ζ and ω n the error distance between the actual parameters and estimated parameters are presented as follows 52 e n ˆ r n ˆ r r r n r n r r r 53 ℓ e i ˆ z n ˆ r i z n r from 42 to 51 the control law of smc is divided into two parts one is the linear part and the other is the nonlinear part the nonlinear part is derived by the traditional smc method but in the linear part the pole placement method is applied to improve the properties of transient response such as delay time rise time settling time and overshoot hence the proposed smc inherits the merits from linear controllers and nonlinear controllers it can be robust to environmental factors and hydrodynamic coefficients but also has a quick response with small overshoot compared with other nonlinear controllers 4 2 1 stability analysis the derivative of the control lyapunov function is described as 54 v s s λ 2 λ 1 s λ 1 2 λ 2 ψ λ 2 r substituting 36 and 40 into 54 the derivative of the clf becomes 55 v s s λ 2 λ 1 s ℓ e 1 λ 1 2 λ 2 ψ e i z n r ℓ e η tanh s where λ 1 0 λ 2 λ 1 λ 2 λ 1 and e 0 ℓ e 1 hence the estimated terms are bounded and can be rewritten as 56 ξ 1 1 ℓ e λ 1 2 λ 2 ψ 57 ξ 2 e i z n r therefore 58 v s λ 2 λ 1 s 2 ξ 1 ξ 2 s ℓ e η tanh s s because ℓ e is positive η is chosen as 59 η ξ 1 ξ 2 ℓ e hence the derivative of clf becomes 60 v s λ 2 λ 1 s 2 ℓ e η tanh s ξ 1 ξ 2 s 0 therefore the control law based on smc is stable 4 3 backstepping control backstepping control bc is also based on the control lyapunov function krstic et al 1995 the bc for heading angle is designed based on previous work from fossen fossen and ross 2006 it has two steps because of the second order nature of the mathematic model the first step starts with z 1 the control lyapunov function is 61 v 1 1 2 z 1 2 the sliding surface is defined as 62 z 1 λ ψ ψ d hence 63 v 1 z 1 z 1 z 1 λ ψ z 1 λ r choosing λ r as the virtual controller that is 64 λ r κ z 2 gives 65 v 1 z 1 κ z 2 the stabilising function κ is chosen as 66 κ k 1 z 1 where k 1 0 is the feedback gain while the new state z 2 is left undefined until the next step this finally gives 67 v 1 k 1 z 1 2 z 1 z 2 the second step starts with z 2 68 z 2 λ r κ the next clf is 69 v 2 v 1 1 2 z 2 2 hence 70 v 2 v 1 z 2 z 2 k 1 z 1 2 z 1 z 2 z 2 λ r κ substituting the dynamic heading model into the expression for r gives 71 v 2 k 1 z 1 2 z 2 z 1 λ i z n r τ r n r n r r r κ the control law is described as 72 τ r n r n r r r i z n r λ κ z 1 k 2 z 2 2 where k 2 0 finally giving 73 v 2 k 1 z 1 2 k 2 z 2 2 0 therefore the proposed controller based on bc is stable when implementing the control law 74 κ k 1 r 4 4 customized second order fuzzy logic control a fuzzy logic control flc system may be designed based on human operator experience or a control engineer s knowledge zimmermann 1996 the proposed flc was designed for the underwater vehicle based on the previous work from jinfeng 2016 the input variables ψ and r are heading error and heading angular velocity respectively hence it is a second order flc method and customizes the rules set for the videoray pro 3 the process of fuzzy inference is shown in fig 4 the inputs are fuzzified first according to the membership functions so that the input variables are described by fuzzy sets in the inference process rules and logical operators are used to map the fuzzified inputs on to the fuzzified outputs the rules list is presented in table 1 in table 1 nb is negative big ns indicates negative small and nm indicates negative middle similarly p is positive and z means zero finally the defuzzification generates the output variable σ r this process also relies on related membership functions the input fuzzification membership functions are presented in fig 5 and fig 6 and the output membership function is presented in fig 7 4 4 1 stability analysis for flc the clf method can be employed to check its stability the approach is analogous to the stability analysis of the smc the space s f can be regarded as 75 s f ψ r the derivative of the clf is described as 76 v s f s f s f s f ψ r then 77 v s f s f ψ 1 i z n r τ r n r n r r r r because the membership functions are piecewise functions because there are 7 7 49 rules there are 49 situations but for each situation ψ and r are bounded hence it can be verified that for each situation the generated output τ r can make sure that v 0 5 simulation the controllers were simulated on the videoray pro 3 in c in the simulations the desired heading angle was 3 r a d 172 o and the initial heading angle was 0 r a d 0 o in order to make presentation clear the degree is used in the results rather than radian firstly the controllers were simulated in noise free conditions and the results are shown in fig 8 the simulation was then run with added noise on the yaw angular velocity as shown in fig 10 the associated control signals are plotted at figs 9 and fig 11 the noise n is considered as white noise it follows a gaussian distribution as 78 n n 0 σ s 2 the unit is r a d s the performance may be analysed in terms of several control properties settling time the settling time is the time required for the response curve to reach and stay within a range about the desired value of a size specified in terms of an absolute percentage of the desired value in this case 5 overshoot the overshoot is the maximum peak value of the response curve if the peak value is much bigger than the desired value then it is common to use the overshoot it is defined by 79 o v e r s h o o t c t p q where c is the response curve and t p is the peak time the peak time is the time required for the response to reach the first peak of the overshoot q is the desired value average error the average error is used to represent the steady error it is defined by 80 e a v e r a g e t t s t i ψ t t i t s where t s is settling time and t i is the length of total time because the numerator in the polynomial is a linear term the unit of e a v e r a g e is o degree variance of error the variance of error is used to describe the oscillation of the response curve after t s it is defined by 81 v a r e t s t i ψ t e a v e r a g e 2 t i t s because the numerator in the polynomial is quadratic the unit of v a r e is o 2 the results of the analysis of the controller outputs are shown in table 2 for the case without any noise the four controllers had very similar performances due to the pole placement method used for tuning the pid controller had a small average error relative to the bc and flc this indicates that the steady error of a pid in idealised conditions can be small the smc had the shortest settling time smallest average error and smallest variance of error among the four controllers the reason for this is that the smc has two parts a linear part and a nonlinear part the merits of the linear controller improve the performance of the smc meanwhile the performances of the bc and flc were very similar for the case with added noise the pid controller ceased to perform satisfactorily the settling time average error and variance of error all increased dramatically this suggested that the pid cannot control the underwater vehicle effectively the model based nonlinear controllers bc and smc and the intelligent controller flc were still able to control the vehicle towards the desired heading angle compared to the bc the flc had a small average error but a big variance of error this means that the heading of the vehicle controlled by the flc had a large oscillations as shown in fig 10 but the centre of the oscillation was close to the desired heading angle the performance of the smc also declined sharply the reason for this was that the linear control part of the proposed smc had a negative impact on the overall performance the simulations were executed under three assumptions 1 the dynamic model parameters were known exactly and never changed 2 the actuators can produce the forces and moments required by the control laws immediately 3 the disturbances are white noise following a gaussian distribution in the normal condition the vehicle will travel at constant velocity and the environmental noise is limited and obeys the gaussian distribution hence the dynamic and hydrodynamic characteristics are fixed in the real world the vehicle may encounter changing conditions therefore the next section presents the practical experiments for comparison applying the way point guidance by line of sight los the controllers can keep the vehicle tracking desired trajectories the path is given by a set of way points 1 0 1 0 5 0 0 5 0 1 1 1 1 1 5 0 1 5 where the unit is meters the results are presented in fig 12 and fig 13 the path following results are consistent with the results for heading angle control in the noise free condition all controllers can guide the vehicle to follow the desired path but pid had a bigger offset compared with the others however in the noisy condition the pid nearly failed the proposed smc turned the vehicle with smallest cross track error among these controllers 6 experiments the experimental tests were carried out in the towing tank at newcastle university bowes 2010 where quantified disturbances could be generated the vehicle was submerged keeping depth about 0 3m the controllers were initially evaluated without any disturbances and results are shown in fig 14 and then waves were introduced as shown in fig 15 the height of the waves was 0 030 m and the frequency was 1 0 h z finally larger waves were generated in the tank to verify the robustness of the four controllers the height of the larger waves was 0 050 m and the frequency was still 1 0 h z as shown in fig 16 in the experiments the desired heading angle is 210 o the rov could make a turn from 360 o to 210 o but in order to evaluate the heading controllers performance clearly the rov started at 0 o generally waves only affect the motion of surface ships with submerged vehicles influenced by current however in shallow water underwater vehicles would be affected by waves furthermore the waves in the towing tank can effectively cause a current as well these conditions could therefore be very close to the realistic conditions that an rov might encounter the results analysis is presented in table 3 for the results without any disturbances the model based nonlinear controllers had fast responses as shown in table 3 although the pid had a longer settling time the variance of error of the pid was 12 94 the smallest value among the four controllers in contrast the flc had a large variance of error and overshoot but the settling time of the flc was shorter than that of the others this indicates that the linear controllers were much more stable but the others are more robust for the proposed smc the linear part of the design can improve its performance in terms of the variance of error and the nonlinear part can result in a small average error and short settling time for the experiments with disturbances as shown in figs 15 and fig 16 the results were analogous to the simulation results with the performances of the pid declining significantly and the average error and variance of error continuously increased conversely the variance of error for the model based nonlinear controllers increased slowly the settling time remained almost at the same value the average error was actually smaller than that in the disturbance free situations because the waves speeded up the oscillation frequency of the rov heading angle the average error converged to zero and it can be seen that the model based nonlinear controllers bc and smc were more robust than the other controllers for the flc settling time remained similar the overshoot and average error increased significantly but the variance of error increased largely this indicates that the flc had large oscillations and in fact large overshoot and significant oscillations are common issues for intelligent controllers narendra and mukhopadhyay 1992 the experiments with the tube as shown in fig 17 were used to show the robustness of these controllers because the water tight tube is installed on the bottom of the vehicle it impacts the hydrodynamic parameters of dramatically meanwhile the parameters of the controllers remained the same as the previous tests therefore this test can indicate the robustness of these controllers to hydrodynamic variation according to the results the flc fuzzy logic control and pid controllers failed in this test whereas the nonlinear state controllers were able to guide the vehicle to the desired heading angle successfully in detail the bc can make the vehicle turn to the desired angle more rapidly than the smc but the smc is more stable than bc due to the large oscillation 7 discussion based on the results of simulations and experimental evaluations the features of different controllers are summarized following 1 the linear controller pid has a long settling time and large average error but a small variance of error after disturbances were added the errors increased rapidly therefore the controller is more stable but less robust relative to the others however after the rov model was changed it failed to guide the vehicle to the reference heading angle this shows that the pid is sensitive to hydrodynamic model variance after the model was changed the parameters in the pid controller need to be upgraded 2 the proposed sliding mode controller consists of a linear controller and a sliding mode controller due to the pole placement methods used for the linear controller it was more stable compared with the bc meanwhile the sliding mode control part enabled it to be more robust than the other controllers it is also robust to model variance because it is still able to lead the vehicle to turn to the desired heading angle after the tube is added 3 the backstepping controller is a model based nonlinear controller derived by using the lyapunov function when the external disturbances were increased the performance of the bc was unchanged therefore it is relatively robust in addition it has a small overshoot compared with smc similarly to the smc the bc can work well after the rov model is changed that shows that the nonlinear controllers have greater robustness to model variance 4 the fuzzy logic controller is an intelligent controller it is constructed through experts knowledge rather than mathematical modelling hence it is relatively easy to understand and to get satisfactory performance from the logical operators however it has large oscillations this drawback is common in intelligent controllers narendra and mukhopadhyay 1992 after the rov modification the flc fails in guiding the vehicle which indicates that the member function and rules need to be upgraded after the modification of the rov 8 conclusions in this paper a vehicle mathematical model was constructed based on the configuration of the videoray pro 3 with the dynamic equations decoupled into three subsystems forward speed diving and steering four different control strategies were then tested for heading control this paper has made two main contributions firstly a comparison of the four different controllers from three different control algorithms is made these controllers are evaluated not only by simulations but also by practical experiments with quantified disturbances and different hydrodynamic models the performances from the controllers are compared and discussed based on their theories secondly an improved smc and a customized second order flc have been developed the proposed smc benefits from the advantages of both linear control and nonlinear control and has better performances over the traditional backstepping nonlinear controller the flc is built into a second order structure with customized rules set for the videoray pro 3 in the next stage the proposed smc methodology will be applied as a functional controller in the artificial intelligence
